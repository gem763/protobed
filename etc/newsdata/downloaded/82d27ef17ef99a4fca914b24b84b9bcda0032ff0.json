Sign up here.\n\nThe outlook for China\u2019s manufacturing sector deteriorated further in August, underlining the weakness in the domestic economy just as a new round of tariffs kicks in.\n\nThe manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index dropped to 49.5, according to data released Saturday by the National Bureau of Statistics, with sub-gauges showing that domestic and new overseas orders contracted. On Sunday, higher U.S. tariffs on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports took effect, as did Beijing\u2019s retaliatory duties on U.S. goods coming the other way.\n\nU.S President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war continues to heap pressure on China\u2019s economy and policy makers at a time when economic output already is in a long-term deceleration. Until now, officials have stuck doggedly to a relatively limited roster of stimulus measures out of concern that more ambitious support would further swell indebtedness and over-inflate the frothy property market.\n\n\u201cWhile we find Beijing\u2019s self-restraint admirable, we are unsure whether this well-intended master plan could be put into practice, as the risks to growth may have been underestimated,\u201d analysts at Nomura International Ltd. including Lu Ting wrote in a note. Toward the end of the year the government \u201cmay be compelled to increase credit growth and ease its tightening measures on property markets again.\u201d\n\nThe government is not sounding the alarm just yet. Late Sunday, the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, released a statement saying that overall risks are \u201ccontrollable\u201d and the economy is stable. At the same time, counter-cyclical adjustments in economic policy will be increased, according to the statement.\n\nA different, private gauge focused more on smaller companies showed manufacturing returning to expansion. The Caixin PMI rose to 50.4 in August from 49.9 in July, in data released Monday. In Saturday\u2019s official data there was a pickup in the PMI for small firms, although it was still in contraction.\n\nExport Contraction\n\nThe official data\u2019s sub-index gauging new export orders rose to 47.2, but was still in contraction, while new orders contracted further. The extra tariffs now will hit manufacturers harder.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\n\nThe fall further into contraction of the official PMI, with almost all the sub-components weakening, shows the need for more policy support is growing more urgent.\n\nWhile the Caixin PMI returned to expansion, \u201cwe are not convinced it indicates a genuine improvement in China\u2019s export sector -- the focus of the survey. The rise was mainly driven by the production side.\u201d\n\n-- David Qu and Chang Shu, Bloomberg Economics\n\nClick here for the full notes\n\nThe Trump administration imposed additional 15% duties on consumer goods ranging from footwear and apparel to home textiles and certain technology products like the Apple Watch. A separate batch of about $160 billion in Chinese goods -- including laptops and cellphones -- will be hit with 15% tariffs on Dec. 15.\n\nThat\u2019s pushing many American companies to move manufacturing out of China to avoid being affected. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. is pushing to reduce its dependence on suppliers in China by more than 40% from last year\u2019s level, but some companies are struggling to do that. Gunmaker American Outdoor Brands Corp. has tried to shift some manufacturing to other countries, but found their supply chains aren\u2019t as sophisticated as China\u2019s and the same components aren\u2019t available.\n\nIn response to the U.S. actions, China targeted U.S. agricultural and manufacturing centers in the Midwest and South, with higher tariffs on soybeans and other farm goods plus increased charges on U.S. autos -- where duties can now total as much as 50%.\n\nIn the official PMI report, the index showing prices at the factory door continued to decline, although the renewed contraction of input prices should relieve some of the pressure on company profits.\n\nThe economy slowed in July and a set of early data collated by Bloomberg showed the trend continuing in August, with poor sales managers\u2019 sentiment and falling trade. However, an improvement in small business confidence is a sign that earlier pro-growth measures may be having an effect.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
