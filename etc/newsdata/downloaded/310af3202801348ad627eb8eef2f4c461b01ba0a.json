For decades it operated quietly, diligently under the radar of public scrutiny, shepherding its anxious clients through a mystifying array of global tax evasion schemes until the release of the Panama Papers in 2016 metaphorically pissed on everyone\u2019s chips. Next thing you know, the office has been raided, its directors are in jail and the golden age is over, or at least under audit.\n\nNow the culprits are back to give their side of the story via the medium of Steven Soderbergh\u2019s The Laundromat, a whip-smart, fiendishly entertaining contender at this year\u2019s Venice film festival. As impersonated by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca amble about in posh tuxedos or brocaded smoking jackets, clutching dry martinis and speaking directly to camera. They could be obsequious waiters or mischievous performance artists, the Gilbert and George of disaster capitalism. They\u2019re here to tell us all about \u201cthe secret life of money\u201d, about futures and equities and the proliferation of shell companies that can be used to hide billions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the story? Empty shells?\u201d snorts an unimpressed journalist and she may well have a point because judged at face value, the subject\u2019s dry as dust. All the same, The Laundromat - \u201cbased on actual secrets\u201d and adapted from a non-fiction book by Jake Bernstein - does a fine job in making a drama out of this financial crisis. Soderbergh (whose CV includes films such as Traffic, Side Effects and Erin Brockovich) understands the importance of putting human faces to dry statistics. He reveals how the tentacles of financial misrule eventually extend to touch honest-to-God human lives.\n\nMossack and Fonseca prize discretion above all things, except possibly money. Naturally, they would \u201cprefer not to know\u201d about the sometimes shady provenance of the clients on their books. The drug kingpins and sex traffickers. The traders in human organs. But happily Soderbergh has no such qualms. So he throws in the tale of a murder inside a business hotel and another about a philandering businessman who buys his daughter\u2019s silence with inflated share options. These case studies are presented with a twinkle of good humour. They play like jaunty little sitcoms but carry the distinct whiff of sulphur.\n\nThe film\u2019s prize asset, though, is Meryl Streep, playing the role of Ellen Martin, an elderly widow on the trail of her late husband\u2019s insurer. Ellen chases the paper trail from one shell company to the next, determined to hold someone to account, until she finally finds an address for the corporation\u2019s head office. This turns out to be a safety deposit box on the seafront out in Nevis.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for action,\u201d vows Ellen, which is all well and good. But viewers hoping for a Hollywood happy ending or even a clear-cut resolution won\u2019t find it here. The film\u2019s too astute and the situation\u2019s too parlous. Earnestly, helpfully, Mossack and Fonseca explain that in fact they are just the tip of the iceberg and that this particular ship has already sailed. Lined up behind them are row upon row of unprepossessing grey men in business suits, sitting behind desks, mainly thinking about lunch. Everyone\u2019s compromised, everyone\u2019s implicated. The machine\u2019s wholly broken. Everything comes out dirty.\n\n\u2022 The Laundromat is released on 27 September", "description": "Steven Soderbergh\u2019s wickedly entertaining romp loosely based on the uncovering of the Panama Papers is an effective mixed wash of truth and fiction", "authors": ["Xan Brooks"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b538400caf85f11cf8d2c31b14785b056485633/122_0_2599_1561/master/2599.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f57ec26567ff34f6714e7fc9a74ed817"}
