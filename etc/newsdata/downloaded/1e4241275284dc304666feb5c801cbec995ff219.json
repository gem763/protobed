Their fate was thrown into question by Trump\u2019s announcement that he would withdraw the 1,000 US special forces in the area, effectively removing the buffer that has stopped Turkey attacking the SDF.\n\nAnkara said the SDF is affiliated to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state since the 1980s. Trump\u2019s decision was widely criticised as a betrayal of the force which did the bulk of the ground fighting against Isis in Syria that risked new fighting in the eight-year-old war and could lead to Isis\u2019 resurgence.\n\nIsis has already claimed a twin suicide attack in the early hours of Wednesday in its former capital Raqqa which killed and injured 25 people.\n\nSDF officials have repeatedly warned their camps and prisons are overflowing, calling on other countries to repatriate some 20,000 foreigners currently under their watch.\n\nMost facilities are chronically understaffed: during a July visit by the Guardian\u2019 to al-Hawl, there were only 400 guards to keep order over around 70,000 people in the camp.\n\nA new alarm was raised over the poor security at al-Hawl and other camps and prisons after SDF spokesperson Mustafa Bali said earlier this week that some of the soldiers currently guarding Isis fighters and their families would be redeployed to the border area to fight off the anticipated Turkish attack.\n\nA source who often visits the camp said there were no signs that the SDF had redeployed any soldiers from al-Hawl, but nonetheless the camp was more volatile than usual.\n\nViolence at al-Hawl has ebbed and flowed since the camp became home to an unexpected influx of women and children after Isis was driven out of the remnants of its territorial \u201ccaliphate\u201d earlier this year. Riots are common, and at least one guard has died after being stabbed. Last week, an improvised explosive device was discovered there.\n\nIn justifying the green light he gave to the Turkish invasion, Trump stressed his belief that Turkey would take on the burden of captured Isis members. However, al-Hawl is outside Turkey\u2019s proposed 32km buffer zone on the border, and US and Turkish officials have not shared details on how such a huge transfer of people between warring parties would be executed.\n\nTrump has also appeared preoccupied that the US would have to pick up the bill for the custody and prosecution of detained European Isis fighters, and the care of their families.\n\nEuropean officials insist the US was never going to have to pay, and that Trump\u2019s response to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s request for acquiescence in his planned offensive might have been based, at least in part, on a misunderstanding of the status of the Isis prisoner issue.\n\nAt the time the Turkish offensive began, the US, France, Germany and other European countries whose nationals had joined Isis, had been exploring ways of prosecuting Isis fighters in the region, most likely in Iraq. It was officially called the \u201cregional prosecution pathway\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe never expected the US to take them back on to US soil, and we definitely did not want them taken to Guantanamo,\u201d a European official said, expressing surprise at the president\u2019s remarks, as the Europeans and the US had been in constant and continuing discussions about the fate of the Isis captives.\n\nThe official said the reason European fighters were not being taken back by their own countries was not about cost, but about the difficulties of prosecuting them.\n\n\u201cIt is a question of due process,\u201d the official said. \u201cCourts at home would throw out cases of detainees captured on the battlefield.\u201d", "description": "Isis sleeper cells are believed to be ready to attack Kurdish guards and free people inside", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan", "Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f524a21bcd2c76c69f0f930cc23ff1209a5c9f5c/282_51_1490_894/master/1490.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4911b63acf6a8651ecdeb3956d6a1d72", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
