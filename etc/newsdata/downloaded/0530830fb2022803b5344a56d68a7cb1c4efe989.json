The 22-year-old Frenchman died following an estimated 160 mph collision with U.S. driver Juan-Manuel Correa's car.\n\nThe crash occurred as they exited a corner on Lap 2 at the high-speed Spa-Francorchamps track, which just hours earlier saw qualifying for Sunday's Formula One race.\n\nBoth Hubert's and Correa's cars were severed in two following the crash, with Correa's car flipped upside down. Hubert's car sustained a huge impact and span around violently, as did Correa's, as debris from both cars was sprayed all over the track. Medics rushed to reach them on the 4.3-mile track located in the Ardennes forest.\n\nAs other drivers swerved around the mangled wreckage of both cars, the race was canceled a few minutes later.\n\nHubert raced for the British-owned Arden team.\n\nAnthoine Hubert of France and BWT Arden celebrates after winning the sprint race of the F2 Grand Prix of France at Circuit Paul Ricard on June 23, 2019 in Le Castellet, France.

God rest your soul Anthoine. My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family today.\"\n\nThe French Automobile Federation said it was \"in shock\" after hearing of Hubert's death.\n\nThe Renault F1 team said in a statement: \"Anthoine was a member of the Renault Sport Academy and raced in the FIA Formula 2 Championship, the final ladder to F1 ... The Frenchman was a huge talent who also brought great energy and positivity to his championship, his teams and the Renault Sport Academy. His smile and sunny personality lit up our formidable group of young drivers, who had formed tight and enduring bonds.\"\n\nFrench driver Esteban Ocon, who has joined the Renault F1 team for next season, tweeted: \"Can't believe it, we had the same age, we started racing together and battled on track for years. All my thoughts goes to his family,\" adding \"Repose en paix\" - or rest in peace - in French.\n\nMany other teams and drivers expressed their sympathies.\n\nHubert won two F2 races this season and was eighth in the championship standings.\n\nThe FIA's statement also gave details of the other two drivers involved: Correa \u2014 a 20-year-old in his rookie season \u2014 and Giuliano Alesi, the son of former F1 Ferrari driver Jean Alesi.\n\nCorrea, who races for the Sauber Junior team, was \"in a stable condition\" and being treated at Liege hospital while 19-year-old rookie Alesi was checked and declared fit at the on-site medical center.", "description": "The 22-year-old Frenchman died following an estimated 160 mph collision with U.S. driver Juan-Manuel Correa's car", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/01/24baf04a-bfba-47ad-b6f7-b7f56139ac2d/thumbnail/1200x630/c2fbc62c42384353d708838f4dd07f3e/ap-19243616548657.jpg"}
