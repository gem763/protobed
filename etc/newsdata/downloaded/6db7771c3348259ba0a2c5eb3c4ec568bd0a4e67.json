(Photo: U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission)\n\nPHOENIX - A Phoenix moving company allowed a manager to repeatedly harass an African American employee with frequent use of racial slurs and dolls that simulated lynchings, forcing the employee to find another job due to the hostile work environment, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nGary Carpenter, who was a manager at Arizona Discount Movers, is accused in the commission's lawsuit of calling employee Clinton Lee the N-word almost every day, making comments such as \"If you're not white, you're not right\" and beginning morning staff meetings by saying \"White Power,\" and making a Nazi salute, an EEOC lawsuit says.\n\nWhen Lee would pick up his paychecks, Carpenter would often tell Lee to leave because employees were holding a Ku Klux Klan meeting, according to the suit.\n\n'A culture of racism': Black workers at UPS facility in Ohio faced decades of racial hostility, lawsuit says\n\nThe manager also displayed figurines that simulated lynchings, according to the EEOC. He placed on Lee's desk a statue of a jockey holding a whip tied in a noose and labeled the statue \"Clint,\" the lawsuit contends.\n\nThe commission said Carpenter also spray-painted a troll doll black, hung it from a hook in the middle of the facility, pointed to it and said, \"Hey Clint, look! That's you!\"\n\nA manager accused of harassing an African American employee hung a troll doll at the moving company they worked at, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. (Photo: U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission)\n\nAfter Lee complained, business owner Amy Hannah told Lee he could take the doll down if he did not like it, the commission's lawsuit says.\n\nLee left the job in 2014 due to the abuse and was out of work for months, according to the commission.\n\n\"Initially, (Lee) tried to justify the harassment as jokes or something he could just ignore, but over time it became increasingly stressful for him,\" EEOC attorney Benjamin Price said in an interview. \"When the troll doll was hung in his workplace, he simply left that day. His wife saw the stress he was under and told him he didn't have to continue to work in that environment.\"\n\nSuch behavior in the workplace is illegal, Price said.\n\n\"The employer tried to pass it off as 'This is just men. This is what they do,'\" he said. \"It's amazing this sort of conduct still exists today.\"\n\nBlack hair bias: Banning ethnic hairstyles 'upholds this notion of white supremacy.'
