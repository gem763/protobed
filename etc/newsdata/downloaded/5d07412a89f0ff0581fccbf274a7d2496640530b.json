As the captains made their way to midfield for the opening coin toss, Mayfield refused to shake Sherman's hand \u2014 a move with which Sherman immediately took issue.\n\n\"That's some college s---. It's ridiculous,\" Sherman told NFL.com's Michael Silver after the game. \"We're all trying to get psyched up, but shaking hands with your opponent \u2014 that's NFL etiquette. And when you pull bush-league stuff, that's disrespectful to the game. And believe me, that's gonna get us fired up.\"\n\nOddly enough, Mayfield took a similar offense in college. Before a game against Kansas, Mayfield's opposing team captains refused to shake his hand ahead of the coin toss.\n\nMayfield responded by torching the Jayhawks en route to a 41-3 victory, and later grabbing his crotch in the general direction of their bench.\n\nOn Monday night, Sherman and the 49ers gave Mayfield a similar comeuppance \u2014 Sherman picked off Mayfield on his fourth pass attempt of the game, and San Francisco cruised to victory in a game that never felt close.\n\nSherman got a little help with his revenge on Mayfield from teammate Nick Bosa, who was a wrecking ball through the Browns offensive line all night, finishing with two sacks, five QB hits, and a fumble recovery. After ending the first half by forcing Mayfield into an intentional grounding penalty, Bosa settled a score of his own, mocking the \"plant the flag\" celebration Mayfield did after defeating his Ohio State Buckeyes in 2017.\n\nRead more: Nick Bosa trolled Baker Mayfield by recreating the quarterback's most iconic college celebration\n\nBut Sherman's post-game criticism of Mayfield was still the stiffest shot fired of the night.\n\n\"Respect the game,\" Sherman said, per NFL.com. \"You can have rivals, but pay your respect in that moment -- especially when you're young.\"\n\nHe continued:\n\n\"He hasn't earned anything in this league. How many games has he won? He's acting like he was the MVP last year. If (Patrick) Mahomes did that, it would be one thing. But he would never do that, because he has too much respect for the game.\"\n\n\"And when you see a guy who doesn't? You humble him every chance you get. Because eventually, he will have respect for the league \u2014 or he'll be out of it.\"\n\nMayfield and the Browns had high expectations heading into the 2019 NFL season. Now through five weeks, they're 2-3, with tough games against the Seahawks and Patriots on the horizon, and no shortage of enemies across the league.\n\nColts quarterback Jacoby Brissett told his coach they should 'run it down their throats' before using an old-school offensive attack to upset the Chiefs\n\nTop 13 waiver-wire pickups for Week 6 of fantasy football\n\nSteelers quarterback Mason Rudolph knocked out cold after hit but walks off field in scary scene\n\nRaiders knocked out of field goal range after Richie Incognito gets flagged for shoving a Bears player's face into the ground", "description": "Richard Sherman had plenty to say about Baker Mayfield after the 49ers blew out the Browns 31-3 on Monday night.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c8bb2b1510247654537f8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
