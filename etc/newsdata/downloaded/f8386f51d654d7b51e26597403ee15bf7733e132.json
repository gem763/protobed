About half of the sites had been restored by early Tuesday morning.\n\nAD\n\nRadio Liberty\u2019s Georgian service reported that a majority of local city councils use a Russia-based email service and that many officials and other Georgians rely on a ride-sharing company based in Russia \u2014 suggesting that attention to cybersecurity is lax at best.
