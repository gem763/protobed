People are afraid to seek advice due to the \u2018fees for no service\u2019 issue and justifiably so.\"\n\nPIFA president Daniel Brammall said the results show there is a \"massive opportunity for financial advisory services which is currently unmet\".\n\nIndependent interest\n\nDemand for financial advice remains particularly acute when considered to be \"genuinely independent\", the research found.\n\nAsked how important it is that an adviser be independent, 73 per cent responded \"very important\", 14 per cent responded \"somewhat important\" and 11 per cent responded \"not at all important\".\n\nEighty-four per cent of respondents said they would be more likely to enter into a long-term relationship with a financial adviser if they were genuinely independent.\n\n\"We already know there's a strong market demand for independent financial advice, this survey puts a reliable number on it,\" Mr Brammall said. \"What's been lacking is the supply.\"\n\nJust how many advisers meet that definition, and what exactly should be meant by genuine independence, is unclear and a matter of vehement debate in the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho is an independent?\n\nOf the 25,000-odd registered financial advisers in Australia, Mr Brammall estimates that potentially as few as 250 and certainly fewer than 500 meet the legal definition of independent financial advice provision as set out in the Corporations Act.\n\nThe PIFA organisation, which mandates legal independence as a prerequisite of admission, has just 50 members nationwide.\n\nThe definition precludes any financial adviser who accepts conflicted payments from using the terms 'independent', 'unbiased' and 'impartial'. This includes life insurance commissions, which are widespread.\n\nIndustry bodies such as the Association of Financial Advisers have argued the legal definition is too strict and should be relaxed.\n\nHowever, Mr Brammall anticipates that an under-reported recommendation of the Hayne royal commission may bolster the supply.\n\nRecommendation 2.2 of the inquiry's final report states that the vast majority of advisers who are not legally independent be compelled to explain why they are not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Advisers are going to have to learn how to be independent or risk being confused with financial product salespeople,\" said Mr Brammall.\n\nThis risk may tip the scales and see a greater number of advisers make adjustments to their business model to avoid making the non-independent declaration, Mr Brammall predicted.\n\nBut Choice does not believe that the Hayne recommendation is sufficient to safeguard consumers against conflicted advice.\n\n\u201cDisclosure of a conflict doesn\u2019t remove a conflict,\" said Mr Veyret.\n\n\"Research suggests disclosing a conflict can actually increase trust in an adviser with no commensurate change in the quality of advice.\n\n\u201cOur sense is that we need to remove the deeper conflicts.\u201d", "description": "Independent financial advice is in short supply, but a little-known royal commission recommendation may change that.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_34/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/be5cd76eda99296b2e26fa5b0bd9dc8a453166e2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
