This includes the use of convict labor, indentured labor, and forced or indentured child labor.\n\nPhilimon Bulawayo/Reuters A Zimbabwean worker holds a piece of rough diamond from the country's Marange diamond fields. Rough diamonds from the diamond fields were detained by federal agents on Monday under suspicions that they were mined from forced labor.\n\nHalting imports under such suspicions is not common, however, with only one other WRO issued this year, according to CBP\u2019s website. That order involved the importation of seafood.\n\nThe products and manufacturers accused of using forced labor are identified as:\n\nHetian Taida Apparel Co., in Xinjiang, China, which produces garments.\n\nWRP Asia Pacific Sdn. Bhd. in Malaysia, which produces disposable rubber gloves.\n\nBonechar Carv\u00e3o Ativado Do Brasil Ltda in Brazil, which manufactures bone black.\n\nGold mined in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nRough diamonds from the Marange Diamond Fields in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Brazilian bone black manufacturer, which goes by the name Bonechar, denied the labor abuse allegations when reached by HuffPost on Tuesday. In an email, a representative for the company provided a copy of a petition it had filed to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative back in April that accuses a North American competitor of making false labor complaints in an effort to harm its business.\n\nBonechar identified itself as the sole Brazilian exporter of bone black to the U.S., making it a target for the other company that imports bone black from Mexico.\n\nAttempts to reach the other companies for comment were not immediately successful.\n\nHetian Taida Apparel Co. was in the news last year after The Associated Press revealed that one of its factories in China operated inside an internment camp that targeted members of ethnic minority groups. Its shipments were tracked to a North Carolina clothing supplier, which sells clothing to college campuses and sports teams nationwide. The supplier cut ties with the company in response.\n\nThis story has been updated with a response from the Brazilian company Bonechar.", "description": "Items from China, Malaysia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe and Brazil were detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93a0d82200008c01dbf4d0.jpeg?cache=66asc0tmqz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
