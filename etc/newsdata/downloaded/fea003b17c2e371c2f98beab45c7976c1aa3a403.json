His resignation highlights the pitfalls of the quest for digital dominance.", "language": "en", "text": "He resigned on Sunday, two days before he was set to start work.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe aborted hire is a parable about how the effort to harness organic online ingenuity, built on distrust of the mainstream media and turned into one of Sanders\u2019s main tactical advantages, can backfire. The campaign, eager to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on viral enthusiasm, plucked the YouTuber from relative obscurity and prepared to put him on payroll. The offer was made before he had been fully vetted, the campaign\u2019s leadership acknowledged, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s clear some of Matt\u2019s prior social media content does not reflect the campaign\u2019s values.\u201d\n\nTo Orfalea, the interest in his video showed he had his finger on the pulse of the movement.\n\n\u201cWhen you see someone you support being misrepresented, that\u2019s what inspires the grass roots,\u201d Orfalea said, explaining why the pro-Sanders video gained so much traction. His aim, he said, is to produce \u201cstuff that\u2019s powerful, that hits people, but that also inspires people and informs people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe episode is also a lesson about the dangers of falsified media, which is a focal point of concern about political disinformation. And it became a new front in the highly charged conflict over how much responsibility someone bears for past posts on social media \u2014 a quandary facing numerous candidates going into 2020.\n\nSanders, in his second run for the Democratic nomination, enjoys an online following that dwarfs that of his rivals. The Vermont independent commands the attention of devoted meme-makers, who turn his clarion calls, as well as his quips, into viral Internet campaigns that reach across platforms like Reddit and Twitch and match the energy of President Trump\u2019s online movement.\n\nHis team has the digital sais quoi that former vice president Joe Biden might envy as he goes toe-to-toe with Trump and his online empire over deceptive claims about nepotism and foreign dealings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCrucially, Sanders is also able to turn the enthusiasm into cash, recently raising more than $25 million in the third quarter, fueled by legions of small-dollar donors.\n\nOrfalea\u2019s video promoting Sanders was a vivid illustration of how the 78-year-old\u2019s fans make him go viral, circumventing mainstream gatekeepers to present a more favorable account of their candidate.\n\n\u201cWhat Bernie does is relay that sense of grievance from his most passionate supporters,\u201d said Ethan Porter, an assistant professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.\n\nFrom his basement living quarters in northwest D.C., Orfalea put together the video over the course of about three weeks, pairing clips of negative commentary, mostly on MSNBC, with favorable imagery of the senator.\n\nAD\n\nThe charge that Sanders is \u201ca not pro-woman candidate\u201d was juxtaposed with a clip of the senator\u2019s rapturous reception at the 2017 Women\u2019s March. The notion that Sanders \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually smile that much\u201d was followed by clips of the senator beaming. In a dramatic close, complaints that Sanders is too loud were interspersed with the verdict of a mother of a diabetic son that \u201cWe are not being vocal enough.\u201d The video was set to music from \u201cThe Green Mile,\u201d the 1999 fantasy crime drama adapted from the Stephen King novel.\n\nAD\n\nSuperimposed on the final minute of the video was a request to viewers: \u201cPlease Share.\u201d\n\nAnd share they did. The video has been viewed nearly 7 million times on Twitter, posted by the activist Shaun King, who was then retweeted by the Sanders campaign\u2019s official account. On Orfalea\u2019s YouTube channel alone, it racked up more than 433,000 views, dwarfing viewership for most of the videos on the campaign\u2019s official channel.\n\nAD\n\nThe video, digital strategists said, testifies to the power of independent online actors, who are sometimes best left alone.\n\n\u201cChange happens from organic momentum,\u201d said Keegan Goudiss, Sanders\u2019s director of digital advertising in 2016 and now a partner at Revolution Messaging. \u201cOnly individuals who aren\u2019t associated with the campaign can produce that, and then the campaign can tap the best tweets or the best content out there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter graduating from the Santa Fe University of Art and Design, which closed last year, Orfalea moved to Los Angeles, where he was an editor with \u201cThe Real World\u201d and \u201cReal World/Road Rules Challenge\u201d before an overuse injury brought him back to D.C., where he had grown up, to recuperate.\n\nAD\n\nHe concentrated on making his own videos, including about politics, and became enamored of Sanders during his 2016 bid for the presidency.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m editing the real real world,\u201d he said, noting the convergence of politics and entertainment and arguing that someone schooled in the ways of reality television could help defeat Trump, who rose to national prominence on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nAs his video, titled \u201cRising Up,\u201d picked up steam, a Twitter message arrived from Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Sanders. The two exchanged ideas over the phone, Orfalea said, about the \u201cneed to make great content.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe was offered a job and invited to tour campaign headquarters last week. Weighing whether to sign up, he feared only for his \u201ccreative freedom.\u201d Campaign staff had already asked that he edit the video, he said, to remove certain figures, including late-night host Trevor Noah, whom they saw as \u201cpossible allies,\u201d Orfalea recounted.\n\nAD\n\nWhen they backed down, Orfalea decided to move ahead with the job, he said.\n\n\u201cHappy to report Faiz and I see eye-to-eye,\u201d he wrote in an email last week. Referring to the senator\u2019s recuperation from a recent heart attack, he added, \u201cI\u2019m joining the squad. Bernie Sanders camp just got some new blood to go with that new heart upgrade.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the campaign shared the video in an email blast to supporters, with the subject line \u201cThese folks HATE Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nThe same day, Orfalea signed a contract, and on Saturday, he recorded a video for his followers, sharing the \u201cbig, big news\u201d that he was joining the campaign.\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, he put the news on Twitter. Within hours, a 53-year-old Sanders critic in New York, Michele Ferrer, dredged up old videos on his channel, which included offensive language and an altered and sexualized rendition of King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nAD\n\nThat evening, Orfalea announced his resignation on Medium, and said the decision to step back was his \u2014 made because he didn\u2019t want his past videos to \u201cdistract from the real issues.\u201d Of the King video, he wrote, \u201cWhen I was about 20 yrs old, I edited MLK audio, to expose how easily media can completely misrepresent reality.\u201d He also apologized for using offensive language about people with special needs.\n\nShakir, in the campaign\u2019s statement, said, \u201cAll initial job offers are contingent on the completion of a final review of a person\u2019s record. That vetting process had not yet been completed.\u201d\n\nIn the celebratory message to his followers, which may now never go live, Orfalea said he had received scads of notes from viewers about how the video had helped them get through to a family member or friend initially turned off by negative coverage of Sanders.\n\n\u201cThe mission,\u201d he said, \u201creally was accomplished.\u201d", "description": "Matt Orfalea, 34, stepped back after a Sanders critic dredged up unseemly old videos.", "authors": ["Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ndly3pJtI9dnYQCzOv4I7gPNHx8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5WWWXOXN2MI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
