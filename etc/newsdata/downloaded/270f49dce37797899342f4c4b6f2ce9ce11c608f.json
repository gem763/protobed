But Johansson had something to say about the matter on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d Monday. (See the video above.)\n\nAfter late night host Jimmy Fallon mentioned that Jost\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d co-anchor Michael Che was excited to do the party honors, Johansson replied, \u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like if he throws it, it\u2019s going to be like by the Port Authority and it\u2019s going to be very local,\u201d the \u201cBlack Widow\u201d star said. She didn\u2019t elaborate, but the neighborhood around the Port Authority, a transit hub in midtown Manhattan, has had a reputation for less-savory party activities.\n\n\u201cMichael\u2019s not throwing it,\u201d she told Fallon. \u201cHe\u2019s not. Is this a thing now?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMarriage Story\u201d actor added that Che is a \u201cdelightful guy\u201d whom she loves. So, maybe there\u2019s room for a change of heart?\n\nSounds like it could be fun \u2015 for the partygoers anyway.\n\nJohansson and Jost announced their engagement in May.", "description": "The \"Black Widow\" star, who recently got engaged to \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian Jost, shared her objections on \"The Tonight Show.\"", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf0691210000ab21ad38ac.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
