It only allowed residents over 47 so their teen daughter was living with her sister. Even their horses had to go.\n\nDesiree says: \u201cIt was a nightmare \u2013 we lost everything, our health, house, horses, everything. It was such a hard time for the whole family.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tommy Reynolds Photography)\n\nBut at their lowest ebb, their luck changed when they won \u00a31million with a Lucky Dip on EuroMillions.\n\nDesiree says: \u201cIt was just amazing. I describe my life in a graph \u2013 a line rising upward for a long time, suddenly plummeting, and then going back through the roof. That\u2019s what it felt like.\u201d\n\nDesiree and Wayne, both 61, met while they were in the Navy, based at Faslane on the Clyde. She was a Wren and Wayne was a submariner and they married in 1980 and built a good life together.\n\nThey had three children and bought a house in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.\n\nDesiree says: \u201cWe really did think we would be there forever. It was a five-bedroom, 1930s semi with extensions, an attic conversion, en-suite bathrooms, a conservatory, a kitchen breakfast room, a downstairs shower room, garden, garage, dining room and study, the lot.\u201d\n\nBut then, in February 2008, Desiree was diagnosed with bowel cancer.\n\nShe says: \u201cBefore I got cancer we really felt we had made it.\n\n\"We had worked hard all our adult lives and we had a beautiful home and a comfortable life.\u201d\n\nBut the cancer treatment was so horrific it left her with PTSD.\n\nShe \u201ckicked the bucket\u201d on the operating table and was revived, only to suffer respiratory failure again 24 hours later.\n\nShe spent 11 days in intensive care.\n\n(Image: Tommy Reynolds Photography)\n\nDuring chemotherapy she developed cauda aquina syndrome, a spinal injury which could have left her paralysed.\n\nShe says: \u201cI was lucky, they caught me in time. I have nerve damage, but I can walk. I had to have an implant to control my bowel and bladder, but for all intents and purposes I am pretty normal now.\n\n\u201cBut I did suffer PTSD as a result of everything. Then there is our youngest daughter, only 16, doing her GCSEs, and having to take on a lot of responsibility and worry as her mum gets ill.\u201d\n\nThings got worse when Wayne, by then an IT project manager, became unemployed and Desiree lost her job too.\n\nShe says: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t pay our bills, we had repossession looming, we had bailiffs turning up on the doorstep, debt letters coming through the post.\n\n\"Creditors standing on the doorstep pricing up our cars, you name it, it was a nightmare.\n\n\u201cSome friends stepped in and gave us a loan to be paid back as and when and just enough money to pay the mortgage for three months so we could sell the house ourselves and not allow bailiffs to do it.\n\n\u201cA friend took our horses because we couldn\u2019t feed them.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, they sold the house, paid off the mortgage and most of their debts and bought a mobile home in East Farleigh, Kent.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nDesiree says: \u201cI remember saying to the children before we moved out, \u2018Make the most of this, this is as good as it\u2019ll ever get for us in terms of homes\u2019.\n\n\u201cI cried all the way from our old house to the mobile home. I didn\u2019t want to give up our house or the lifestyle, but we had to move on, pay our debts, and go forward with our lives.\u201d\n\nIn July 2014, their luck finally changed.\n\nDesiree says: \u201cTwice a week, Wayne bought a Lucky Dip. When we realised we had won, I went into shock.\n\n\u201cHe only told me we had won half a million over the phone as he didn\u2019t want me to be too shocked. I only found out we had won a million later that night.\u201d\n\nOne of the first things they did was repay the friend\u2019s loan and take her out to the Savoy to celebrate.\n\nThey have since given \u00a3300,000 to friends and charities, and bought a new home, a renovated pumping station with moorings on the riverside on the mobile home park, near their old place.\n\nThey make a small income from renting out the moorings and Desiree went back to work part-time as a receptionist and Wayne as a delivery driver.\n\nDesiree says: \u201cWe wake each day to birdsong and we watch the boats wind their way up the river \u2013 a view we\u2019ll never tire of. This corner of Kent has bought us luck, health and happiness.\n\n\u201cWe feel so lucky and happy to have been given the chance to get our lives back on track.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: From rock bottom to EuroMillions success, the Homes' family fortunes really turned around", "authors": ["Adam Aspinall", "Image", "Tommy Reynolds Photography", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660069.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-PROD-Desiree-Home.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
