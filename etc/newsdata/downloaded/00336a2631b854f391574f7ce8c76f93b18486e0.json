The philanthropist believes the commitment is \u201conly a small fraction\u201d of what\u2019s needed to right gender inequality in the country, she wrote.\n\n\u201cI want to see more women in the position to make decisions, control resources, and shape policies and perspectives,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI believe that women\u2019s potential is worth investing in \u2015 and the people and organizations working to improve women\u2019s lives are, too.\u201d\n\nUsing her company Pivotal Ventures, Gates will funnel resources into companies that are actively trying to uplift women in business, politics and more. Her three-pronged approach includes dismantling the barriers to women\u2019s professional advancement such as caregiving responsibilities and sexual harassment at work. Additionally, Gates plans to help fast-track the careers of women working in technology, media and public office, because, she writes, these industries were designed for and created by men. Lastly, Gates will fund research and data on gender inequality in several sectors.\n\n\u201cI hope the financial commitment I\u2019m making today is seen as both a vote of confidence in the experts and advocates who are already working on these issues \u2015 and an invitation for others to join the cause and make commitments of their own,\u201d Gates wrote. \u201cEquality can\u2019t wait, and no one in a position to act should either.\u201d\n\nHead over to Time magazine to read Gates\u2019 full essay.", "description": "\u201cEquality can\u2019t wait, and no one in a position to act should either,\" the philanthropist wrote on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d94af1d2100003c02f97c43.jpeg?cache=bbvppsjam7&ops=1778_1000"}
