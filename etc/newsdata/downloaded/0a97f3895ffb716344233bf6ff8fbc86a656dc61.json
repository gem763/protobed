Argentina has a long-standing claim on the islands it calls Las Malvinas, and invaded and occupied the archipelago in 1982.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But the climate is less appealing, with an average of 9C in the peak summer months of January and February.\n\nMost visitors to the islands arrive on cruise ships, which last season brought nearly 63,000 arrivals. One vessel, the Royal Princess, brought 3,430 visitors \u2013 exceeding the entire population of the Falklands, which is 3,200.\n\nCruise passengers spent \u00a34.1m between them, but longer-stay tourists are more valuable. Although there are so few of them, they stay an average of 10 nights and spent \u00a34.2m collectively last year.\n\nThe UK is the main source of visitors, at around 650, with Argentina in second place at around 400.\n\nMost British travellers arrive on the RAF Airbridge service from Brize Norton in Oxfordshire via Cape Verde. The fare is \u00a32,222 return, and nationals from Russia, Ukraine, China, Egypt and other countries are banned.\n\nBut a new link begins on 20 November from Sao Paulo to Mount Pleasant airport, 33 miles from Stanley on East Falkland.\n\nOnce a month it will touch down en route at Cordoba in Argentina \u2013 the nation\u2019s second city, 400 miles northwest of Buenos Aires\n\nLatam currently operates a weekly flight from Santiago in Chile via the southern Chilean city of Punta Arenas. It occasionally also calls at Rio Gallegos in Argentina. But the link from Sao Paulo, South America\u2019s main air hub, will make access far easier for European and North American visitors.\n\nFares from Sao Paulo to the Falklands are typically around \u00a3500 return, and test bookings made by The Independent found fares from London Heathrow of below \u00a31,000 return for travel in March.", "description": "The tourism season is beginning in the Falkland\u00a0Islands, with another record southern summer expected.
