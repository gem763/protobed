They're developing drones enabled with AI computer vision, in the hopes they can help out with both disaster relief and surveillance.\n\nIIT-M calls it 'Eye in the Sky' services.\n\n\"With further marginal development, it can be extensively used in surveillance operations. The innovation is platform agnostic and has immense value. It is not without reason that Microsoft and Lockheed Martin have recognised this effort,\" said PR Shankar, Faculty Advisor and Professor of Practice at IIT-M's Department of Aerospace Engineering.\n\n\"The innovation team is working with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Armed Forces to develop and deploy indigenous technologies for totally Indian solutions to Indian problems.\"\n\nA team from the institute's Centre for Innovation (CFI) is working on building drones, as well as outfitting them with artificial intelligence capabilities. They want to use computer vision to analyse a video feed from these drones and use it to identify things like people trapped in disaster-hit areas, so rescuers can get to them.\n\nDon't Miss 134 SHARES\n\nThe drones and their AI will use already available technology, but the IIT-M team is training the AI using their own databases. The team had also recently won the finals of the Indian Innovation Growth Programme (IIGP 2.0) University Challenge hosted by IIT Bombay.\n\nThis sort of technology could do wonders in things like flood situations, earthquake epicenters, and more. It would also help police monitor vast gatherings like the Kumbh Mela, where it's impossible to deploy enough officers on the ground to cover every stretch of crowd.\n\nNow one has to only hope this technology isn't misused by authorities or the government to carry out surveillance, given that we have a few regulations on surveillance cameras, but not specifically ones that fly up into the sky.", "description": "The Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M) on Wednesday said its students have been working on new drones.
