We will put power in the hands of workers,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\n\u201cLabour is on the side of the people in the real battle against the born-to-rule establishment that Johnson represents. We stand for the interests of the many \u2013 the overwhelming majority who do the work and pay their taxes \u2013 not the few at the top who hoard the wealth and dodge their taxes.\u201d\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) employers\u2019 group said Labour\u2019s proposals would \u201cturn back the clock decades\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt a time when the UK is already on the watchlist for international investors, these proposals will do further harm to our economy. We ask Labour to rethink and engage with business,\u201d said Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general.", "description": "Britain's opposition Labour Party said on Tuesday if it won power it would create a Ministry of Employment Rights to deliver better wages, greater job security and give workers more of a say over how their workplaces are run.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428286660&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890OG", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
