They said the measure is not directly related to other parts of the US-China relationship.\n\nState Department officials said the Chinese were notified this past week, and that they had already received one notification today of an official meeting. However, the officials refused to specify how the State Department would address any failure to comply with the new requirement, only that they would address it at that time.", "description": "Chinese diplomats in the United States will now have to report meetings with state and local officials, as well as visits to educational and research institutions, under new rules introduced by the State Department.", "authors": ["Mike Conte", "James Griffiths"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180807183233-chinese-flag-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
