Then last week, Democrats forced a vote to reverse part of the 2017 tax reform legislation that capped deductions for state and local taxes, which failed. Finally, on Wednesday, the Senate rejected a resolution pushed by Democrats that sought to undo the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on waivers that give states the opportunity to circumvent certain Obamacare guidelines.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 effort to strip the Trump administration\u2019s interpretation of \u201c1332 waivers\u201d failed by a 43-52 vote. The waivers allow states to experiment with their own insurance models in addition to Obamacare, and the Trump administration has adopted the view that the waivers allow states to circumvent the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe waivers were created by the Democratic authors of the Affordable Care Act, but Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer has labeled the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on them an effort to \u201csabotage the health care of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is preposterous that the Trump administration claims to care about preserving preexisting condition protections for millions of Americans while simultaneously peddling shoddy, substandard junk plans that undermine and weaken those very protections,\u201d the New York Democrat said in a statement this week.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander responded to Democrats\u2019 suggestions that Republicans were taking advantage of Americans by labeling the Democratic maneuver an early Halloween trick.\n\n\u201cWhy would you take away a flexibility option that you wrote to give your own voters lower health care rates?\u201d the Tennessee Republican and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee asked his colleagues on the Senate floor Wednesday. \u201cI know it\u2019s Halloween, but don\u2019t be tricked, don\u2019t believe this scary fairy tale. Protections for preexisting conditions when you buy health insurance is the law, nothing in the 1332 waiver changes that.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget said in a policy statement this week it \u201cstrongly oppos[ed]\u201d the Democrats\u2019 resolution.\n\n\u201cThe last administration\u2019s guidance harmed Americans by requiring states to meet very exacting and burdensome requirements in order to receive a waiver from the Obamacare requirements,\u201d the OMB said in a policy statement. \u201cBy contrast, the Trump administration\u2019s guidance empowers states with flexibility to work around some of Obamacare\u2019s most glaring failures and to give Americans more options to get health coverage that better meets their needs.\u201d\n\nOMB pointed out that 13 states have used the Trump administration\u2019s guidance. Of those states, the statewide average individual market premiums dropped in a range from down 6% in Rhode Island to down 30% in Maryland, the Trump administration said.\n\nMr. Schumer\u2019s Democratic colleagues signaled on Wednesday that although their resolution failed, the vote did serve a purpose \u2014 to showcase Republicans\u2019 true plans for health care.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump supports overturning the law that provides protections for people with pre-existing conditions while he is expanding junk plans that don\u2019t provide those protections. That is the Republican health care plan,\u201d said. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrat, in a statement. \u201cWhile Senate Democrats are working to help make things better for the American people, Senate Republicans are helping the Trump administration make things worse.\u201d\n\nSen. John Cornyn branded Democrats\u2019 messaging about pre-existing conditions \u201cnot true\u201d in remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOur Democratic colleagues are simply waging a war against a problem that does not exist, but I guess if you say it often enough and loudly enough, some people somewhere may just believe that coverage of pre-existing conditions is somehow a partisan issue. It\u2019s not,\u201d the Texas Republican said. \u201cThey\u2019re grasping at straws as their party, unfortunately, has gone further and further to the left on health care.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
