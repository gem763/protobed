That would help Mr Erdo\u011fan fulfill domestic political pledges to reduce the number of Syrians in Turkey.\n\nIt also has the strategic benefit of creating a buffer zone of Syrian Arabs in between the Kurds of northeast Syria and the Kurds of southeast Turkey.\n\nTurkey says it will provide public services in areas it occupies but many fear that Kurdish populations in Syria will be displaced and the area will be unable to support so many refugees.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan proposed the safe zone at the UN Credit: Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg More\n\nWhat happens to ISIL prisoners in Syria?\n\nWestern officials are deeply concerned that the fighting will cause chaos that could allow Isil prisoners to escape. Some of the prisons holding Isil suspects may be seized by advancing Turkish forces but there is little chance of an orderly handover from the Kurds to the Turks who are attacking them.\n\nOther prisons further south will stay in Kurdish hands. However, there may be still be problems there as the SDF is likely to pull its troops away from guard duties to defend their territory.\n\nThe White House says Turkey will be responsible for all sil prisoners in the area.\n\nWhat will the SDF do now?\n\nThe SDF has vowed to fight against the Turkish offensive but may decide that some tactical retreats are necessary rather than face a full-on assault.\n\nSDF fighters have proved themselves adept against Isil but they lack the heavy weaponry to confront Turkey\u2019s military power, especially its air force.\n\nOver the longer term, the SDF may decide it has no choice but to align itself more closely with the Assad regime. The two sides have many disagreements but have a shared goal of keeping the Turks out of northeast Syria.\n\nThe SDF have vowed to fight the Turkish offensive Credit: Photo by Handout / RONAHI TV / AFP More", "description": "What will the Turkish offensive look like?\u00a0 Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has proposed a large-scale offensive across 480km of the Turkish-Syrian border to drive back the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which Turkey considers a terrorist group, and create a \u201csafe zone\u201d for Syrian refugees.\u00a0 Many Western", "authors": ["Raf Sanchez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KxuPkIPP4C_vZ7SdI0torg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/ae6aad1e698d2d9daf8758826e1ce110", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
