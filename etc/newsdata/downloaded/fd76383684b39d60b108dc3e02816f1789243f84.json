MoviePass: Subscription service to officially shut down", "language": "en", "text": "MoviePass, the monthly subscription service that once allowed moviegoers to see one film a day for a discounted rate, will officially shut down starting Saturday, Sep. 14. It was 8 years old.\n\nOn Friday, MoviePass announced to its subscribers that it would be \u201cinterrupting the MoviePass service for all its subscribers effective Sep. 14, 2019, because its efforts to recapitalize MoviePass have not been successful to date,\u201d according to a press release.\n\nAs the statement continues, parent company Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. \u201cis unable to predict if or when the MoviePass service will continue,\u201d but is continuing \u201cefforts to seek financing to fund its operations.\u201d HMNY\u2019s board of directors assembled \u201ca strategic review committee\u201d to look over a \u201cstrategic and financial alternatives,\u201d after which the committee found \u201cno assurance that any such financing will be obtained or available\u201d on their terms for MoviePass.\n\nThis development brings the long, twisty journey of MoviePass to a close. Perhaps there are some who didn\u2019t even realize there was life left in it.\n\nAfter an initial beta launch in 2011, the service became complicated in the past few years, starting when it abruptly shut off users\u2019 access to 10 large AMC movie theaters across major cities. According to reports, MoviePass sought reduced ticket pricing from theater chains, which AMC did not want to accommodate. The service returned shortly thereafter, but the drama continued.\n\nAs costs continued to pile up, MoviePass began limiting subscribers to three movies a month for the subscription fee, though the company said it wouldn\u2019t raise prices. Of course, that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nMore recently, the service shut down this past July for \u201cseveral weeks\u201d to update the app, though a return plan had not been addressed at the time. By August, TechCrunch published a report stating the service exposed thousands of customer credit card numbers.\n\n\u201cWe still deeply believe in the need for the MoviePass service in the marketplace, to maintain affordable access to theaters and provide movie lovers with choices of where to go to the movies,\u201d the company wrote in an email to subscribers on Friday. \u201cIn August 2017, MoviePass began a transformation of the moviegoing industry by introducing its low monthly price subscription service. Since then, others in the industry have followed our lead. Now, as a result of this transformation, movie lovers throughout the United States have the ability to see movies in theaters using subscription services at prices they can actually afford, albeit with limited choices of theaters using those services. In the course of this industry transformation, MoviePass has experienced setbacks and challenges that are well known. Nevertheless, MoviePass remained committed to leading and competing in an industry that is resistant to outside competition and change. We believe that fostering competition and change in the moviegoing industry is critical to the satisfaction of the moviegoing public and filmmakers alike.\u201d\n\nMoviePass is survived by AMC Stubs A-List and Regal Unlimited.\n\nRelated content:", "description": "MoviePass dead: Movie subscription service shuts down", "authors": ["Nick Romano"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/626.Fp18i3T_weDXpPlZxw--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/ed3954369a6dcd0fc6197215eab3fe47", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
