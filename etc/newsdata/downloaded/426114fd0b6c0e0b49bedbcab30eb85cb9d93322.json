I didn't observe any child restraints or even seat belts and I asked why the kids aren't in car seats. She said, she can't afford them at this time.'\n\nOfficer Kevin Zimmerman (middle) of the Milwaukee Police Department purchased Andrella 'Lashae' Jackson two car seats for her daughters (left and right) after she explained she could not afford them\n\nJackson (pictured), who was struggling paying bills and had to buy winter clothes for her five children, could not afford the car seats\n\nJackson, a mother-of-five, explained she struggling when trying to cover all the necessary expenses.\n\n'With bills coming up and winter coming up, I have to get coats and boots and shoes for my kids. So it was hard for me,' she said.\n\nBut Jackson's financial troubles went beyond needing a new car and she was unable to register because of cost.\n\nShe told Zimmerman she purchased the car at an auction and was struggling to afford that, much less car seats.\n\nZimmerman (middle) went the extra mile and installed the two car seats for Jackson after purchasing them from Walmart\n\nPictured: Zimmerman spent $75 on the two EvenFlo car seats in a gift to Jackson\n\n'I'm a father myself, I have three kids,' said Zimmerman.\n\n'I thought of my kids jumping around. What if a car hit them and they flew and got seriously hurt, if not killed?'\n\nZimmerman was rightfully concerned.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that 675 children in the United States 12-years-old or younger died in car accidents and 116,000 were injured.\n\nOf those startling numbers, 35 percent were not buckled up or in proper restraints.\n\nCar seats also reduce the risk of injury in a crash up to 82 percent and booster seats reduce the risk by 45 percent for children four to eight-years-old.\n\nInstead of ticketing Jackson and fining her up to $75 for violating Wisconsin's seat belt law, Zimmerman decided to use that money elsewhere.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Jackson explained that Zimmerman escorted them to a local Walmart and purchased two car seats for around $75.\n\nThe CDC found that car seats (pictured) also reduce the risk of injury in a crash up to 82 percent and booster seats reduce the risk by 45 percent for children four to eight-years-old\n\nShe wrote: 'GOT PULLED OVER FOR KIDS' NOT BEING IN A CARSEAT AND HE WENT IN BOUGHT AND ALSO INSTALLED THEM IN MY CAR. MY GIRL'S COULDN'T STOP THANKING HIM AND IT MADE THEM SMILE...WE APPRECIATE IT ALOT.'\n\nWord of the 12-year police veteran's act has gone viral and Jackson's post has over 11,000 likes.\n\nMany of the comments are praising Zimmerman's generosity and selflessness.\n\nThe Milwaukee Police Department also applauded Zimmerman for his good deed.\n\nThe Department wrote in a Facebook post: 'Thank you Officer Zimmerman for going the extra mile and going above and beyond your call of duty.'", "description": "Andrella 'Lashae' Jackson was certain she was going to get ticketed when Officer Kevin Zimmerman of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, pulled her over, but he instead bought her two young daughters car seats", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20083686-0-image-a-10_1571835811145.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
