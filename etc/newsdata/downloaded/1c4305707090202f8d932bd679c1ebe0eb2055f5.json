Of note, younger Canadians (18-34) are much more likely to feel this way, versus those 55-plus (61 per cent to 43 per cent).\n\nThe survey, titled Digital Democracy in Canada, an Angus Reid survey of 1,500 Canadians (conducted between September 26 and October 1) was commissioned by Adastra Corporation, a global leader in data management and analytics.\n\nThe poll found broad consensus on a couple of salient points across the country. Specifically, more than nine-in-10 Canadians (94 per cent) wish it were easier to hold politicians accountable and an identical number feel there needs to be a way to make the parties care about more than their stump issues. In terms of which issues matter, three quarters of Canadians (74 per cent) would welcome new ways to allow issues to be more personalized to them through digital means.\n\n\u201cThere are many challenges facing elections and democracy, some of which are in the news, and others which are long-term, structural issues,\u201d said Marcos Da Silva, Director, Analytics Products and Strategy at Adastra, based in the GTA.\n\n\u201cWe conducted this survey to get a benchmark on how Canadians feel about those challenges and discuss how digital transformation can be used to solve problems, breathe new life into democracy and engage citizens.\u201d\n\nDigital democracy was defined in the survey as \u201cthe use of modern digital technology and strategies in the political and governance processes\u201d. In Canada, and globally, all industries are undergoing Digital Transformation, including healthcare, an area with as much at stake for citizens as democracy.\n\nWhere Canadians stand on digital democracy\n\nRespondents were queried regarding several issues of digital democracy. Four-in-five Canadians (82 per cent) fear that a more digital democracy is a threat in terms of election fraud or hacking, while three-in-five feel it is a threat to privacy (63 per cent).\n\nBut unpacking the findings a bit further, it becomes clear there is attraction for digital democracy:\n\n75 per cent of Canadians agree that a more digital democracy is an opportunity to breathe new life into democracy and engage younger citizens.\n\n69 per cent feel that all of society is undergoing a digital transformation, and elections/voting needs to get on board.\n\n65 per cent feel a more digital democracy is an opportunity to hold politicians more accountable.\n\nIn terms of which issues matter, three quarters of Canadians would welcome new ways to allow issues to be more personalized to them through digital means.\n\n\u201cDigital transformation can increase security and privacy, mitigate risk, control hacking and guide recounts,\u201d said Da Silva. \u201cMoreover, when organized in a transparent and responsible way, it can strengthen the governance process, align constituents and parties on issues, ensuring a relevant and personalized focus.\u201d\n\nAdastra has worked diligently at the forefront of technology for two decades \u2013 transforming and disrupting norms and ideas in ways never thought possible.
