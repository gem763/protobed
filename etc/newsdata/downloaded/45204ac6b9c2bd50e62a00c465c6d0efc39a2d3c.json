For most people, Siri is the robot who lives on your iPhone.\n\nInstead, another female name \u2014 Alexa \u2014 dominates the home, powered by a variety of different Echo devices.\n\nBut Apple wants to change that, according to a new report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple is reportedly building out a team to tackle Amazon and Google's dominance of the smart home market.\n\nTo that end, the company is said to be hiring engineers to work on the project. One possible solution: New types of products for the home, beyond Apple's current smart speaker, the HomePod.\n\nApple's HomePod getting scrutinized by a potential buyer.

Apple offers the HomePod, which was met with mixed reviews from critics when it arrived in 2018. Though Apple's smart speaker is still sold, it has failed to capture consumer attention the same way that Amazon and Google home products have.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, Apple is looking to companies like Amazon and Qualcomm to poach smart home engineers.\n\nIn addition to new devices, Apple is reportedly looking to build out its HomeKit software suite to appeal to more third-party product makers. It's unclear what such an effort could produce, and Apple isn't saying \u2014 representatives did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Apple is reportedly building out a team to take on Amazon and Google's dominance of the smart home market.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6f04bdee01936542084c2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
