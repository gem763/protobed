We have a Prime Minister selling a deal that can't be done, a Queen that trusts him as far as she could throw him, and multiple politicians running away from their own voters.\n\nThings are so bad only Priti Patel is laughing. At this stage, the only thing that would raise the national eyebrow would be finding out Dominic Cummings was being operated by......... Rebekah Vardy's account.\n\nBoris Johnson has somehow become a PM even more doomed to failure than the last one. The whole nation watched, fascinated and repulsed at the same time, as Theresa May became so bogged down by Brexit that all she could do was honk hoarsely about the achievements she didn't have.\n\nBut Johnson seems to have constructed his own prison cell. In a swamp. Filled with flesh-eating parasites. And it's being livestreamed.\n\nHe cannot get a deal. He cannot No Deal. He can't call a general election. The only options he has left are to resign or remain.\n\nAccording to reports at the weekend, he also fears losing his seat in the general election he insists is the only way out of the headlock he has put himself in. If this scenario hadn't cost the nation \u00a360bn in lost GDP so far, it'd be funny.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nUxbridge and Ruislip has turned against its MP. He already has the smallest majority of any PM since 1924, at a little over 5,000 votes, and now faces the prospect of being the first party leader since Arthur Balfour in 1905 to be defenestrated by his own voters.\n\nLast week, he carried out a highly-publicised visit to Beaconsfield, a safe seat with a 24,000-vote majority - and whose incumbent, Dominic Grieve, was recently banned from ever standing for the Conservatives again, for the crime of being cleverer than the PM.\n\nThere are 20 other such constituencies, where the majorities may not do as much for his chances of winning as he hopes.\n\nVoters tend to disapprove of non-resident candidates being parachuted in under the assumption they're stupid enough to vote for just anyone. It's what has always done for Nigel Farage's Parliamentary hopes - his own fault, really, for telling people to mistrust migrants.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nTo refuse to face your own voters is an admission of failure, and other parties will throw the kitchen sink at any constituency the blond bombast pitches up in. It won't be a normal election, if Johnson is on the ticket - it will be a judgement on the PM.\n\nAnd what a lot there is to judge.\n\nHe resigned rather than sign a Brexit deal he said was \"burdensome\" for business, involved paying for access to the single market, and turned the UK into a \"colony\" of the EU because it meant accepting rules on agrifoods.\n\nHe has now suggested, with great fanfare, a deal which does all of those things in a slightly more complicated way.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nJohnson's great 11th hour deal is for two borders where we're not allowed to have one, more regulations than we already have, a system of rebates we have no system for, and a massive potential for carousel fraud across a supranational border he's promised not to check and where, incidentally, migrants would also be able to move at will.\n\nThat's not a deal, because no-one will agree it. It's just the previous offer that was voted down 3 times, chewed up so it is even more unattractive, and presented for a fourth time in the hope the wingnuts are sane enough to realise it's this or nothing.\n\nEven if by some fluke of mass desperation he could pass the deal, he still can't Brexit by October 31 - the Trade Act needs to be amended, 27 EU member states need to ratify, and he'll need the extension he vowed to die over rather than ask for.\n\nAnd he has to ask for it in FOUR DAYS.\n\nHe led a vote for a thing that was never possible.\n\nThe border issue he promised could be overcome with number plate recognition cannot. The regulations he promised would lessen must increase. The immigration he pledged to control will continue unfettered, because we need it and because Ireland.\n\nHe has learned the hard way that the horse he chose to ride into Downing Street is a bucking nightmare.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe threatened No Deal so convincingly that Parliament legislated, more convincingly, against it.\n\nHe derided the zombie Parliament so strongly that, when he demanded a general election, it asserted its sovereignty to deny him the chance of a mandate which needed only 24% of the public vote.\n\nHis record as Mayor of London, which he likes to quote because it's one of the few jobs he hasn't been fired from, is besmirched by allegations of favours for flirty pole-dancing businesswomen and several official investigations.\n\nAnd having attempted to illegally wield the Queen for his own political ends, she's now been ordered to read out a list of proposed laws that he cannot get on to the statute book because he has a majority of -43.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nHe can't Brexit. He can't govern. He couldn't call a vote if you gave him a megaphone. But as yet, he can't admit defeat, either.\n\nHis next roll of the dice could be to collapse the government, and leave the floor open to Labour and the Lib Dems to see if they can rule with the help of the SNP.\n\nHe doesn't want to do that, because they probably can.\n\nHis final, nuclear option would be a u-turn so extraordinary it could be matched only by Donald Trump becoming pals with Greta Thunberg. Remaining in the EU is something he once supported, and however unlikely or implausible it is, there is a squeak of a chance that he's unprincipled enough to switch sides again. Lord only knows how he'd spin that - some guff about the NHS, probably.\n\n(Image: via REUTERS)\n\nHow did someone purportedly so intelligent get himself in such a mess?\n\nEither he's actually quite incredibly thick, and even more suicidally-obtuse than his predecessor, or it's all an elaborate ruse by Coleen Rooney to flush out a serial liar whose public image was a sham.\n\nIf so, dear Reader, it's working. The swamp of his own making is up to his neck, and he's floundering wildly.
