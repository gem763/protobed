Trump has said this, and so has his White House counsel, making this the White House\u2019s official political, substantive and legal position.\n\nBut this defense is cracking up. That\u2019s because we\u2019re now learning, one after another, that all of the people around him knew that it was grievously wrong \u2014 that is, all except for those who were carrying out Trump\u2019s corrupt scheme.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nAs this becomes more public, Trump\u2019s position will grow increasingly unsustainable \u2014 not just as a rhetorical matter but also in terms of whether he\u2019ll be able to keep the support of Senate Republicans, his final line of defense.\n\nThe latest domino to fall is John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. The New York Times reports that in July, Bolton grew so alarmed by efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch \u201cinvestigations\u201d into Joe Biden and his son that he instructed an aide to alert White House lawyers.\n\nThat aide is Fiona Hill, a former senior White House adviser on Russia and Europe. Hill testified about this exchange with Bolton to House investigators as part of their impeachment inquiry. Hill told them that Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had run what The Post calls a \u201cshadow\u201d campaign to pressure Ukraine to do Trump\u2019s political bidding.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton reportedly told Hill to tell White House lawyers.\n\nCrucially, this eruption came after a meeting in early July at which Sondland made it clear that the goal of this shadow campaign was to get Ukraine to revive investigations into Burisma, the company on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter sat. This confirmed for Bolton that the goal was to leverage Ukraine into acting as Trump\u2019s weapon against Biden \u2014 that is, by manufacturing smears designed to debilitate him in the 2020 election.\n\nThat made Bolton go \u201cballistic.\u201d And on another occasion, Bolton described Giuliani, one of the scheme\u2019s ringleaders, as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nThis long-running plot, of course, culminated in Trump\u2019s July 25 call in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to undertake investigations that would undercut the idea that Russia interfered on Trump\u2019s behalf in 2016, and again help him rig the election in 2020. \u00a9 Alex Wong/Photographer: Alex Wong/Getty Im (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nTrump\u2019s defense is collapsing\n\nIt is striking how many people around Trump did not share his view that this conduct was entirely unobjectionable, or, as Trump keeps putting it, \u201cperfect.\u201d The story now is that those ranks are swelling fast. Let\u2019s review:\n\nAs the whistleblower detailed, White House officials were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the July 25 call \u2014 so much so that they loaded the transcript onto an ultra-classified computer system normally reserved for the most sensitive information in the government\u2019s possession.\n\nWe subsequently learned that at least four national security officials were so unnerved by this ongoing pressure campaign that they raised concerns with White House legal staff both before and just after the call.\n\nAnd now we know this conduct made Bolton go \u201cballistic\u201d and fear it would \u201cblow up\u201d the White House, leading him to also alert White House lawyers to it.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance continues to be that this pressure was entirely within his legitimate authority. The White House counsel\u2019s letter, which we now know was largely dictated by Trump, declares that there was \u201cnothing wrong\u201d with the July 25 call as detailed in the rough White House transcript. That transcript shows Trump explicitly naming Joe Biden while demanding investigations.\n\nThus, Trump\u2019s explicit position is that pressuring Ukraine to help him smear a leading domestic political opponent, not merely to investigate unspecified \u201ccorruption,\u201d was absolutely fine. In his own words, Trump has flatly said that Ukraine \u201cshould investigate the Bidens.\u201d\n\nTrump puts GOP senators in untenable spot\n\nI submit that this is a key reason vulnerable GOP senators are having so much trouble with their responses to this scandal. You probably saw that viral video of Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner repeatedly refusing to say whether it\u2019s appropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival:\n\nIowa\u2019s Joni Ernst was also caught on video pulling a similar homina homina homina. The rub here is they can\u2019t condemn this, because Trump continues to tell the GOP base that this conduct was, and is, the correct thing to do.\n\nIt\u2019s a form of poetic justice: Trump\u2019s shamelessness, his brash and open flaunting of his ability to engage in bottomless corruption to rig the next election on his own behalf with impunity, is precisely what\u2019s making it harder for Republicans to distance themselves from it.\n\nBut as more and more people around Trump let it be known that they viewed this corrupt conduct with horror, this refusal to condemn that conduct will become impossible to sustain. That will edge those senators into a position where they are acknowledging it\u2019s indefensible while saying it\u2019s not impeachable.\n\nThat stance may be just tenable enough to allow Republican senators to vote against removing Trump. But the increasing precarity of this balancing act will further weaken those of them who are already vulnerable to losing reelection. And as they withdraw their defense of Trump on the substance of his corruption, that will weaken him politically as well.\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: Defying White House, ambassador explains public service to a corrupt president\n\nGreg Sargent: At rally, Trump tells 5 big lies in under 3 minutes\n\nPaul Waldman: Two Giuliani associates were just arrested.
