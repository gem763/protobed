(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nCalifornia and 22 other states filed a lawsuit in federal court Friday against the Trump administration, challenging its decision to revoke the most-populous state\u2019s right to set pollution limits on cars and light trucks.\n\nThe legal battle\u2019s outcome will affect which vehicles Americans drive in the years to come, as well as the country\u2019s effort to tackle climate change and the balance between federal and state power.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest salvo in the escalating legal and political fight between President Trump and California, which has created uncertainty and divisions in the auto industry. Both domestic and foreign automakers are grappling with which standards to follow as they prepare to manufacture vehicles for U.S. consumers over the next decade.\n\nOn Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department formally revoked the waiver allowing California to set stricter limits on tailpipe emissions than the federal government, as part of a broader effort to scale back federal rules requiring U.S. auto fleets to average nearly 51 miles per gallon by model year 2025. Trump officials have drafted a plan to freeze federal mileage standards at roughly 37 miles per gallon though model year 2026.\n\nXavier Becerra, the state\u2019s attorney general, argues in the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that the administration overstepped authority given by Congress in withdrawing a waiver California has used to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change.\n\n\u201cThe Oval Office is really not a place for on-the-job training,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump should have at least read the instruction manual he inherited when he assumed the presidency, in particular the chapter on respecting the rule of law. Mr. President, we\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\n\nThe cities of Los Angeles and New York, along with the District of Columbia, also joined in Friday\u2019s lawsuit. The mayors of Los Angeles, New York and D.C. are Democrats. And all but two of the states in the lawsuit, Massachusetts and Maryland, have Democratic governors, though the attorneys general in those two states are Democrats.\n\nA total of 13 states and the District have pledged to adopt California\u2019s tailpipe emissions standards if they are stricter than those of the federal government. Collectively, the group represents roughly 30 percent of the nation\u2019s auto market.\n\nIn July, four automakers \u2014 Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America \u2014 struck a deal with California to produce cars and light trucks through model year 2026 that would reach a fleetwide mileage average of nearly 50 miles per gallon by 2026. The Justice Department is investigating whether the agreement violated federal antitrust law.\n\nCalifornia had enjoyed a long-standing exemption under the Clean Air Act to ask for federal waivers to impose stricter air pollution standards, and received its most recent waiver as part of a broad agreement among the Obama administration, the auto industry and the state to set the first national carbon limits on vehicles.\n\nIn taking back the waiver, Trump officials argued that only the federal government has the right to set fuel economy standards under the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act and that California did not have the right to use its exemption under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon pollution linked to climate change because that ranks as a global problem.\n\nIn a statement, EPA spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer said that the waivers are only given so that California can tackle \u201clocal pollution.\u201d\n\n\u201cEPA has granted those waivers over many years. But California cannot misuse that authority to set national fuel economy standards and attempt to control national greenhouse gas emissions standards,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are confident we are correctly applying the law and will prevail in the courts.\u201d\n\nBut Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration 60 times since the president took office, pointed to two 2007 federal court decisions as precedent that would bolster the state\u2019s case in court. In both cases, Green Mountain Chrysler Plymouth Dodge Jeep v. Crombie and Central Valley Chrysler-Jeep Inc. v. Goldstene, judges ruled that state limits on carbon dioxide emissions from cars and light trucks did not violate existing federal law.\n\n\u201cTwo courts have already upheld California\u2019s emissions standards, rejecting the argument the Trump Administration resurrects to justify\u201d the withdrawal, Becerra said.\n\nTrump and his deputies argue that less stringent mileage requirements will keep the sticker price of vehicles lower and spur drivers to replace older cars with newer, safer models.\n\nRevoking California\u2019s waiver, the president tweeted, will make \u201ccars substantially SAFER.\u201d\n\nThe EPA and the Transportation Department plan to finalize the revised rule by the end of the year.", "description": "California and 22 other states filed suit in federal court Friday challenging President Trump\u2019s decision to revoke the most-populous state\u2019s right to set pollution limits on cars and light trucks.", "authors": ["Dino Grandoni", "Reporter Covering Energy", "Environmental Policy", "Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs", "September At Pm", "Dino Grandoni Is An Energy", "Environmental Policy Reporter", "The Author Of Powerpost'S Daily Tipsheet On The Beat"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uodoJ5LMtyq9xoJwJ6DSSeAuo5Q=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PTPRD6G2S4I6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
