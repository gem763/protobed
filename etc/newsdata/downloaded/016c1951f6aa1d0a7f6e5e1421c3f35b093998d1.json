Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re drawing back at all,\u201d Vice Admiral Jim Malloy, commander of the U.S. Navy\u2019s Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet, said in an interview.\n\nThe United States, Saudi Arabia, Britain, France and Germany have publicly blamed the attack on Iran, which denies involvement in the strike on the world\u2019s biggest crude oil-processing facility. The Iran-aligned Houthi militant group in Yemen has claimed responsibility.\n\nMalloy did not comment on any U.S. intelligence guiding his assessment. But he acknowledged that he monitored Iranian activities closely, when asked if he had seen any concerning movements of Iranian missiles in recent weeks.\n\nMalloy said he regularly tracks Iranian cruise and ballistic missile movements \u2014 \u201cwhether they\u2019re moving to storage, away from storage.\u201d He also monitors whether Iran\u2019s minelaying capabilities head to distribution sites or away from them.\n\n\u201cI get a briefing of movements on a daily basis and then assessments as to what that could mean,\u201d he said.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated sharply since President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions on its oil exports.\n\nFor months, Iranian officials issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran were blocked from exporting oil, other countries would not be able to do so either.\n\nHowever, Iran has denied any role in a series of attacks that have followed, including against tankers in the Gulf using limpet mines earlier this year.\n\n\u201cDENY IT IF YOU CAN\u201d\n\nAsked what the latest attack in Saudi Arabia showed him, Malloy said: \u201cFrom my perspective, it is a land-based version of what they did with the mines ... quick, clandestine \u2014 deny it if you can.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend a signal and harass and provoke,\u201d he said.\n\nHis remarks came a week after the Pentagon announced it was sending four radar systems, a battery of Patriot missiles and about 200 support personnel to bolster Saudi defenses \u2014 the latest in a series of U.S. deployments to the region this year amid escalating tensions.\n\nStill, the latest deployment was more limited than had been initially under consideration.\n\nReuters has previously reported, for example, that the Pentagon eyed keeping an aircraft carrier in the Gulf region indefinitely, amid speculation that the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group will soon need to wind up its deployment.\n\nMalloy declined to speculate about future carrier deployments. But he acknowledged the tremendous value of aircraft carriers \u2014 as well as the ships in the strike groups that accompany an aircraft carrier.\n\nThat includes the contribution of destroyers now accompanying the USS Abraham Lincoln to a U.S.-led, multinational maritime effort known as Operation Sentinel.\n\nIt is meant to deter Iranian attacks at sea \u2014 and expose them if they occur.\n\nSHINING A FLASHLIGHT\n\n\u201cWhat Sentinel seeks to do is shine a flashlight across that and make sure that if anything happens in the maritime, they will be exposed for that activity,\u201d he said.\n\nThis includes by providing a surveillance and communication backbone to share intelligence with nations that have agreed to participate, which include Britain, Australia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created essentially a zone defense,\u201d he said.\n\nWashington first proposed the effort in the Gulf in June after accusing Iran of attacking oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz, a critical maritime chokepoint. But the proposal was met with concern in some European capitals, already at odds with Washington over its withdrawal from the nuclear deal.\n\nMalloy met Saudi Arabia\u2019s naval commander on Sunday, assuring him of U.S. support following the Sept. 14th attack, which rattled global oil markets. He said U.S. support included intelligence sharing. \u201cWe are constantly in the process of tightening that information flow with them,\u201d Malloy said.", "description": "Iran has not drawn back to a less threatening military posture in the region following the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Arabia, the top U.S. admiral in the Middle East told Reuters, suggesting persistent concern despite a lull in violence.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436999974&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930UP", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
