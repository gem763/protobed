It quickly established itself as nothing short of a missile on four wheels and with a sub-$120,000 price tag, it was the ultimate bang-for-your-buck deal of the century. It\u2019s time for a little revisit of the first version of the R35.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the pre-facelift R35, by the way. The one where the price was still in the five digits. As time went on and the GT-R gained more and more power, it also got more and more expensive. That\u2019s where it lost me. But this 2009 GT-R on Regular Car Reviews is the good one. This Recession GT-R is where it\u2019s at.\n\nNormally, a 2009 GT-R would be making about 500 horsepower. This one, because it\u2019s been tuned, now makes about 600. I\u2019ve had the great fortune to have driven a couple of GT-Rs, so I understand Mr. Regular perfectly when he says this is a car that\u2019s so fast it feels like it\u2019s bending time. You feel like you\u2019re going into warp drive and things aren\u2019t slowing down anytime soon.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve always loved the noise an R35 makes. I don\u2019t care what the snobs say, the VR V6 sounds cool and burbly. And there\u2019s a perpetual clanking noise coming from the car\u2019s transmission. Sort of like a Ducati\u2019s dry clutch rattle, as Mr. Regular points out.\n\nThese things counter industry-wide reports that an R35 is soulless and boring. They\u2019re very exciting cars. They are just... too fast for human reaction time, and that\u2019s why there are so many onboard computers. Trust me, you need them.", "description": "When the Nissan R35 GT-R came out in 2007, it ate Porsches for breakfast.
