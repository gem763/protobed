She was driving in sliders which you wear on the beach normally.\n\n\u2018She had been out somewhere nice wearing nice shoes and took them off as she did not want to drive in those nice shoes.\n\nKatie Leadbeater leaves Manchester Magistrates Court after she was banned from driving for 12 months (Picture: Cavendish)\n\n\u2018So far as any loss of balance that would be the main reason. Her income monthly will go because she lives north of Bolton and she has a job in the Trafford Centre.\n\n\u2018It won\u2019t be economically viable for her to get there and keep the job.\u2019\n\nLeadbeater was also fined \u00a3360 and was ordered to pay \u00a3436 in costs and surcharges.\n\nShe was also offered a chance to attend a drink driving rehabilitation course to reduce the length of her ban.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
