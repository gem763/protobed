The lackluster debut calls to mind Uber, which also fell in its first day of trading as investors scrutinized its history of steep losses.\n\nLate Wednesday, Peloton priced its shares at $29, the high-end of its previously proposed pricing range . At its IPO price, Peloton was valued at about $8 billion, or roughly double its private market valuation one year ago.\n\nIt is trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker \"PTON.\"\n\nPeloton is best known for its internet-connected indoor bikes and subscription cycling classes that can be streamed live or on-demand into homes. In addition to its indoor bikes, which cost $2,245, the company also sells a $4,295 treadmill with an HD touchscreen for viewing classes. Customers pay subscription fees of $39 per month associated with its bike and treadmill to participate in classes.", "description": "Yet another unprofitable company is struggling to win over investors on Wall Street.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925170425-peloton-bicycle--stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
