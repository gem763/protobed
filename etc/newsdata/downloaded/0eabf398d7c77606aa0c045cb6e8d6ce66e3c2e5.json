If history is any guide and we get typical turnout, they are going to lose,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics and lead architect of the model. \u201cThey need to be at DEFCON 1 or it\u2019s likely Trump will be reelected.\u201d\n\nThe model, which Moody\u2019s plans to present to clients this week, called every election since 1980 correctly until missing in 2016 and predicting Hillary Clinton would defeat Trump.\n\nIn response to the miss, Moody\u2019s expanded the range of potential voter turnout and made several other changes to how it assesses voter reaction to economic conditions. If applied now, Moody\u2019s says the altered models would have called 2016 for Trump.\n\nAnother Moody\u2019s model, focused mainly on the stock market, finds Trump would win with 298 electoral votes. A third, which focuses on state-specific unemployment rates, finds Trump would win with 332 electoral votes. In an average of its three models, Trump would also win with 332 electoral votes to 206 for the Democratic nominee.\n\nBut despite all this, Trump is far from a lock.\n\nThe key for Democrats to overcome Trump\u2019s advantages on the economy: generating massive turnout. And high turnout in the 2018 midterms \u2014 coupled with strong enthusiasm among Democrats to oust Trump \u2014 suggest that voting in 2020 could hit historic highs.\n\nMoody\u2019s found that if turnout among non-incumbent voters \u2014 Democrats and independents \u2014 were to match historical highs, the Democratic nominee would win under the stock market and employment models as well as an average of the three models.\n\nAnd plenty could still change between now and next November that would move state-level economic models away from Trump, especially in the critical states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nFurther trade war damage hitting employment in those states would be the biggest risk for Trump, which could help explain why Trump appears eager to at least call a truce in his bruising trade battle with China.\n\nThe economy is already slowing this year with growth expected to hit only around 2 percent, well below Trump\u2019s promises of robust growth of 3 percent or more every year. Job creation has also slowed to 157,000 per month over the last three months from over 200,000 per month last year. And the impact of tariffs has hit particularly hard in industrial states key to Trump\u2019s reelection. Manufacturing has declined in each of the last two months and further deterioration could shift economic models away from Trump.\n\n\u201cPennsylvania is particularly critical, and it comes down to just a handful of counties,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cThe stock market also matters a lot. If you get a 10 percent correction in stock prices, the picture changes dramatically and Democrats win under a typical turnout scenario.\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s also does not attempt to account for the personal characteristics of candidates, relying instead on typical voter behavior for generic nominees of either party. And Trump is about as far from a generic candidate as it is possible to be.\n\n\u201cIt could be that this election may be so out of bounds with history that the models just aren\u2019t going to work,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cIt could turn out this thing runs on a dynamic you just can\u2019t model.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7a/67/e9c0f01544f4bad6c08c214b853a/191015-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
