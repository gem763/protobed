No one is above the law,\" said Pelosi, who accused Trump of betraying his oath of office and endangering national security.\n\nAdditionally, Clinton's comments for impeachment came after a flood of Democrats, some of whom had previously held out against impeachment, joined the effort.\n\nTrump tweeted after Pelosi\u2019s announcement that the inquiry was \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d and a \u201ctotal witch hunt.\u201d\n\nTrump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have pushed claims for months that Biden as vice president sought the ouster in 2016 of Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where his son Hunter served on the board of directors.\n\nThe push by the vice president came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from European diplomats and the U.S. State Department because international leaders said Shokin did too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country.\n\nThe Ukrainian Parliament voted Shokin out. Ukrainian officials have found no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen and Christal Hayes\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump impeachment inquiry: Hillary Clinton backs Nancy Pelosi's move", "description": "The former secretary of state who ran against Trump in 2016 said that she \"did not come to that decision easily or quickly, but this is an emergency \u201d", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S1bj2CvjC3Alxs8k1EE16w--~B/aD0zMDc4O3c9NDYxNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/8f7ae1618cbd3fed3f203421421af721", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
