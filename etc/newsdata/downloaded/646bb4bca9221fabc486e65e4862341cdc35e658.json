A three-judge panel had thrown out a GOP-drawn Ohio map under which Republicans have won 12 of the 16 congressional seats in each of the last four elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s June 27 ruling in a North Carolina case said federal judges lack authority to strike down voting maps as excessively partisan. The ruling was 5-4, with the court\u2019s five Republican-appointed members in the majority.\n\n\u201cWe have no commission to allocate political power and influence in the absence of a constitutional directive or legal standards to guide us in the exercise of such authority,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court in that case.\n\nDissenting Justice Elena Kagan said partisan gerrymanders \u201cdebased and dishonored our democracy, turning upside-down the core American idea that all governmental power derives from the people.\u201d\n\n\u2018Snake on the Lake\u2019\n\nThe groups challenging the Ohio map, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, conceded to the Supreme Court that the June ruling required dismissal of their case.\n\nThe Ohio map includes several bizarrely shaped districts, including one along Lake Erie that has been dubbed \u201cthe snake on the lake.\u201d Two Republican-held districts near Cincinnati split the area in what the three-judge panel described as a \u201cstrange, squiggly, curving shape, dividing its Democratic voters and preventing them from forming a coherent voting bloc.\u201d\n\nThe three-judge panel issued its ruling in May, while the Supreme Court was deliberating over the North Carolina case. The high court put the Ohio ruling on hold days later.\n\nThe Ohio case is Householder v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, 19-70, and Chabot v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, 19-110.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Greg Stohr in Washington at gstohr@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie Ass\u00e9o, Anna Edgerton\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court tossed out a lower court ruling that would have required Ohio\u2019s congressional voting map to be redrawn to be less favorable to Republicans.The move is part of the fallout from the high court\u2019s decision in June insulating partisan gerrymanders from constitutional", "authors": ["Greg Stohr"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BrVao45SemadLCBzraYRNA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/127e4f6350b8cfdf08becea9bfd53a83", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
