This is to be commended as this led to our investigation and ultimately his dismissal by the panel.'", "description": "Metropolitan Police officer Mark Eve, based in Romford, was found guilty of misconduct over a litany of breaches that included using racist language in direct conversations and WhatsApp chats.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19797364-0-image-a-3_1571244250611.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
