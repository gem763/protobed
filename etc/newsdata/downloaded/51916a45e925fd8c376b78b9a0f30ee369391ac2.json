Wouldn't it be nice to be pregnant with someone you love?'\n\n'Because I had an abortion last year, I just started sobbing,' she confessed.\n\nTraumatic: Abbie explained the frequent discussions about pregnancy and babies on The Bachelor were upsetting in light of her experience. Pictured on the show with former Bachelor winners, Snezana Wood (left) and Laura Byrne (centre), who were both pregnant at the time\n\nAbbie acknowledged that her abortion made her 'hesitant' to start a family.\n\nHer situation was made worse by the fact other people on set, including Sogand Mohtat and Matt Agnew's friend Kate, would often ask her about having children.\n\n'I'm so sick of having to justify [to these women] why I haven't been screaming from the rooftops, \"I want kids\",' Abbie said.\n\n'At that time, I felt very guilty for saying that I wanted kids because I had aborted one in March last year.'\n\nEmotional trigger: Abbie told the Shameless podcast that she broke down in tears after a male producer suggested how 'nice' it would be to have a child\n\nAbbie went on to say that producers didn't know about her abortion before the show.\n\nThey didn't find out until she discreetly told Matt Agnew about it in a 'whisper', which prompted a crew member to tell her: 'Abbie, you're going to have to say it out loud.'\n\n'And then I turned around, looked dead in the camera and said, \"I had a f**king abortion last year!\"' Abbie added.\n\nVulnerable moment: Producers didn't find out about Abbie's abortion until she discreetly told Matt Agnew (right) about it in a 'whisper'.
