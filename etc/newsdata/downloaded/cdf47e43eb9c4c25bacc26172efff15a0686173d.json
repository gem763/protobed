Because she planned to sail West of Westeros, across the body of water known as the Sunset Sea.\n\n'GAME OF THRONES' WON'T HAVE A FINAL SEASON RE-DO DESPITE FAN BACKLASH\n\nArya, played by Maisie Williams, asks her cousin, played by Kit Harrington, in the final of the HBO adaptation: \"What is West of Westeros? No one knows. It's where the maps stop. That's where I'm going.\"\n\nHowever, author George R.R. Martin left a big hint in the books the series was based on that suggests Arya might be wrong \u2014 and another ferocious female may have paved the way.\n\nAround 250 years before in 54 A.C. (After the Targaryen Conquest), a noblewoman named Elissa Farman sailed west and discovered three islands, which she named after the three Targaryens who conquered Westeros.\n\nElissa was the daughter of Marq Farman of the Fair Isle, with two brothers: Franklyn and Androw.\n\n'GAME OF THRONES' CLEANS UP AT EMMY NOMINATIONS\n\n'GAME OF THRONES' PREQUEL SERIES TO FEATURE FAN-FAVORITE FAMILY\n\nMuch like Arya before her, she refused to be ladylike \u2014 in fact, she scared off two suitors for marriage when she was 12 and 16 \u2014 and is said to have spent more time on the water than the land.\n\nShe was also very close with her brother Androw's wife, Rhaena Targaryan, with many suggesting the pair had their own romantic relationship.\n\nHowever, when her eldest brother ordered Rhaena leave their Fair Isle home and then told Elissa she needed to stay and marry, the lady planned her escape.\n\n'GAME OF THRONES' STAR LENA HEADEY REVEALS DELETED SCENE COULD HAVE DRAMATICALLY CHANGED FINALE RECEPTION\n\nCut off from the funds of Fair Isle, she asked Rhaena for money to build ships. At first, the Targaryan denied, causing a rift in their relationship, before reluctantly agreeing.\n\nAs Alissa left, she stole three eggs from her lover's dragon, which she sold to the ruler of the city of Braavos.\n\nIt's said those eggs are the same given to Daenerys Targaryen in season and book one.\n\nWith this newfound money, she built the boat the Sun Chaser and set sail for the Sunset Sea, West of Westeros.\n\n'GAME OF THRONES' STARS SOPHIE TURNER, MAISIE WILLIAMS WOULD 'KISS A LOT' TO STOKE RUMORS\n\n'GAME OF THRONES' STAR SOPHIE TURNER HONORS SANSA STARK, SAYS SHE AND JOE JONAS SPLIT BRIEFLY\n\nShe was a fugitive from the continent but managed to evade capture with her ship, as well as two others from Ser Eustace and Ser Norman of Hightower.\n\nIn 59 AC, Ser Eustace returned back to his home and explained that Elissa discovered three exotic islands. She named them Aegon, Rhaenys and Visenya after the three dragonriders that conquered Westeros.\n\nHowever, despite protests from Ser Eustace, Elissa sailed further west, never to be seen again.\n\n'GAME OF THRONES' ACTRESS ACCUSES ISRAELI CHILD SERVICES OF KIDNAPPING HER BABY\n\nMany years later, Lord Corlys Velaryon believed he saw the old, withered Sun Chaser in Asshai, a mysterious city in the far east of the eastern continent Essos.\n\nSo it is suggested Elissa discovered what is West of Westeros: she sailed all the way West until she ended up in the East.\n\nThis can all be found in George R.R. Martin's complete history of House Targaryen, \"Fire & Blood.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMaybe if Arya paid a bit more attention in Maester Luwin's history classes, then she wouldn't have to embark on the treacherous journey.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Sun.", "description": "The final season of \"Game of Thrones\" saw the Stark family go their separate ways for the last time.
