An ultrasound revealed a softball-sized tumor on Kaylee's right ovary\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women and accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system\n\nSigns and symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, urinary frequency and heartburn.\n\nBut most women who are diagnosed are postmenopausal - 50 percent of patients are age 63 or older.\n\nThis makes Kaylee among the youngest of patients ever diagnosed.\n\nIn April, one week after she was diagnosed, she underwent surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible and her right ovary.\n\nThe tumor was sent off for a biopsy and, two weeks later, the Tollesons were told that, because the cancer had spread to Kaylee's abdominal wall, she was stage III.\n\n'We almost fell off the chair when [the doctor] explained all of this to us,' Kaylee's mom Kelly Tolleson, said in an interview with Texas Children's Hospital.\n\n'I asked over and over again: \"Did it really spread? Where did it spread to? Please explain everything again.\" That was a hard day.'\n\nIn April, Kaylee had surgery to remove the tumor, which sent off for a biopsy, and all of her right ovary. Pictured: Kaylee in the hospital\n\nTwo weeks after the biopsy, her parents were told the cancer had spread to her abdominal wall and she had stage III ovarian cancer. Pictured: Kaylee in the hospital\n\nIn April, Kaylee began chemotherapy and, after four months, she was declared cancer-free. Pictured: Kaylee meeting her favorite weatherman Travis Herzog\n\nKaylee immediately began chemotherapy - four rounds over 12 weeks - at Texas Children's Cancer Center.\n\n'Her world was turned upside down,' her mother told Good Morning America.\n\n'Every thing was taken away: her ice skating, her Girl Scouts, she couldn't play outside. She was removed from school and couldn't complete her last 9 weeks of third grade.'\n\nDespite the debilitating side effects, Kaylee's mother said that one thing that kept her daughter going were weather forecasts.\n\nKaylee wants to be a meteorologist and, when local weatherman Travis Herzog learned of her cancer battle, he invited her to visit the ABC-13 studios.\n\nIn mid-July, the family went in for a check-up and received the news that Kaylee's scans were clear and she got to ring the cancer-free bell on the oncology ward.\n\n'It feels amazing to ring the bell because everyone will know that I finally finished my chemo treatment, and that I'm cancer-free,' Kaylee told Texas Children's.\n\n'I'm going to be getting out of here, busting my way out.'", "description": "Kaylee Tolleson, nine, of Missouri City, Texas, was diagnosed with stage III ovarian cancer in April 2019.
