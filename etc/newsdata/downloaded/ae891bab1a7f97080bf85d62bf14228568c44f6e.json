On September 20, people all over the world will take to the streets to protest the biggest crisis of our times: global warming. The Global Climate Strike is expected to see millions of workers and students walk off the job to participate in peaceful but vociferous rallies around the globe.\n\nWhen it comes to taking time off work, there is no cause more worthy than this \u2013 but first you need to get your boss on the same page. Here\u2019s how to get involved in the strike without jeopardising your job in the process.\n\nAfter Australia\u2019s historic 1983 America\u2019s Cup victory, Bob Hawke famously remarked: \u201cAny boss who sacks anyone for not turning up today is a bum.\u201d By this token, any boss who disciplines staff for participating in the Global Climate Strike is a colossal arsehole.\n\nIt goes without saying that tomorrow\u2019s event is a lot more important than some silly yacht race. Scientists have warned we have a decade \u2013 at the most \u2013 to reverse the man-made rise in global temperatures before our planet reaches the point of no return.\n\nHopefully, your manager will be behind you 100 per cent. Realistically, they should be marching alongside you (it\u2019s their Earth too, after all.) But if you anticipate copping some flak, here are a few tips to ensure there are no repercussions with your boss for attending the rally.\n\nEducate them\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of media coverage explaining what tomorrow\u2019s rally entails and why it\u2019s so important. Start with the official Global Climate Strike page \u2013 it contains all the relevant information about the protest. Also point them to the #NotBusinessAsUsual movement. This is a consortium of leading Australian businesses who are actively supporting the global climate strike and their employees\u2019 right to participate.\n\nYou should also take the time to dispel some of the flagrant bullshit peddled by the fossil fuel industry. Casually leave this myth-busting guide in the office Slack channel (or email it directly to your boss if you\u2019re chummy enough.)\n\nDon\u2019t take the piss\n\nMost of tomorrow\u2019s rallies are set to kick off at noon. It\u2019s therefore not imperative that you take the entire day off.\n\nRemember, the Global Climate Strike is more about raising awareness than deliberately putting a dent in the economy. Yes, we want the world\u2019s leaders to sit up and take notice, but the same level of visibility will be achieved regardless of how long we march for.\n\nInstead of using the event as an excuse to sleep in, go to work as normal and then take a (very) extended lunch break \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing.\n\nWhat if your boss is a global warming sceptic?\n\nYou\u2019re screwed, basically. You could try these debate tactics, but you\u2019re probably not going to change their mind in a single afternoon.\n\nIf your boss thinks global warming is a bunch of hippie nonsense, just call in sick \u2013 it will be the most noble sickie you will ever chuck. Even if your boss suspects you\u2019re putting it on, it\u2019s highly unlikely any action will be taken; the resulting PR would be catastrophically bad.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve hopefully cleared your attendance, it\u2019s time to prepare!
