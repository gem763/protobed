More than 5,000 companies have responded to 97 percent of consumers filing a complaint, she said.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a nonpartisan consumer-advocacy group, analyzed complaints made through the CFPB and found that more than 223,000 grievances resulted in relief for consumers. More than 75,000 people got money back from the companies they complained about, according to the report released earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe database opens a window onto the marketplace,\u201d said Ed Mierzwinski, U.S. PIRG\u2019s senior director for Federal Consumer Programs. \u201cThere is no perfect way to study the financial industry. We need this window open.\u201d\n\nBut as you might imagine, the companies being complained about don\u2019t like the database being public. They argue that people are only getting one side of the story and that the complaints might not be accurate. (It should be noted that the Bureau also gives companies the option to post a public response.)\n\n\u201cSince its inception, the Consumer Complaint Database has not been without controversy,\u201d Kraninger said in a statement about the changes.\n\n[Trump\u2019s war on government is going swimmingly]\n\nMick Mulvaney, the former interim head of the CFPB and now acting White House chief of staff, didn\u2019t want to keep the database public despite the fact that the bureau is required to provide certain information to Congress about complaints and responses. In referring to the rule, Mulvaney said, \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in here that I have to run a Yelp for financial services sponsored by the federal government.\u201d\n\nConsumer advocates contend that the complaint narratives potentially provide insight into illegal or unfair practices.\n\nBut to appease businesses, the CFPB is making some changes to the complaint system, most notably adding disclaimers, which the agency is calling \u201cenhancements.\u201d\n\nThe bureau is also exploring how to put consumer complaints in context by adding market share and company size. The theory being large companies with a huge consumer base would of course have more complaints.\n\nIn the meantime, let me put the CFPB disclosure language in context, with Mierzwinski\u2019s assistance.\n\nCFPB says: \u201cThis database is not a statistical sample of consumers\u2019 experiences in the marketplace. \u2026 Complaint volume should be considered in the context of company size and/or market share. For example, companies with more customers may have more complaints than companies with fewer customers.\u201d\n\nI say: Don\u2019t let this clear shill for the companies deter you from looking through the information for similarities to your situation. Go to consumerfinance.gov/complaint to view other people\u2019s stories. Click \u201cyes\u201d to show complaints with narratives.\n\n\u201cThe database has tremendous value,\u201d Mierzwinski said. \u201cThat\u2019s why industry wanted it shut down \u2014 not because it needed to be viewed in context, but because it opened a clear window on the marketplace they wanted kept shut.\u201d\n\n[How Trump appointees curbed a consumer protection agency loathed by the GOP]\n\nCFPB says: \u201cWe don\u2019t verify all the allegations in complaint narratives.\u201d And: \u201cUnproven allegations in consumer narratives should be regarded as opinion, not fact.\u201d\n\nI say: Well, here we go: the old \u201calternative fact\u201d defense, a line made infamous by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.\n\nYes, in telling their story, consumers are conveying the situation from their point of view. But think about how unjust something must feel for someone to take the time to file a grievance.\n\n\u201cOne complaint may not say much about a firm, but if as few as two or three consumers tell the same story, others might say, \u2018that\u2019s exactly what happened to me\u2019 and file a complaint, too, which will lead to needed changes at the firm, or even to a pattern or practice enforcement action,\u201d Mierzwinski said.\n\nCFPB says: \u201cComplaints can give us insights into problems people are experiencing in the marketplace and help us regulate consumer financial products and services under existing federal consumer financial laws.\u201d\n\nI say: The CFPB made the right call in not shutting down the consumer complaint database.
