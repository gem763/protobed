A couple of them I caught him on, I dazed him and hit him with two or three more right after that and he didn\u2019t fall. I was a little surprised about that.\n\n\u201cComing back off of that, I feel like I did well. Transitioning from my wrestling to my striking and putting everything together pretty well to get the win.\u201d\n\nWilcox was a tough opponent to prepare for, according to Rosta. His \u201cawkward\u201d and \u201csloppy\u201d style made timing a difficult task. In order to deal with the weirdness, Rosta decided to counterpunch his opponent.\n\n\u201cWhen we were watching his fights, he was kind of stiff, kind of awkward, hard to deal with,\u201d Rosta said. \u201cIn film, some of his fights they looked sloppy, but a lot of those guys are awkward and hard to deal with. You can\u2019t usually strike with your normal technique. They kind of push you or bring you down a little bit. You\u2019ve got to adapt to that a little bit.\n\n\u201cWhen I was standing back and taking some pressure off myself a little bit, I was trying to let him provide some offense so I could hit him with counterpunches. If I\u2019m just going in every single time and I\u2019m pressing the action and he\u2019s just going for the counter swinging wild every time he comes in, he caught me a few times. I was really trying to just work my game plan the best I could and see how I could get the finish. It ended up being on the ground and sometimes it\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d\n\nRosta\u2019s first pro victory came at Bellator 219 in March when he defeated Cody Vidal by first-round TKO. Vidal injured his knee just 66 seconds into the fight, which led to the stoppage.\n\nBellator 231 took place Friday at the Mohegan Sun Arena.
