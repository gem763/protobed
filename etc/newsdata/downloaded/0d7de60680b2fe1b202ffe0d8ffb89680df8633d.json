Liana said.\n\n'Bias. That's not the term to use.'\n\nBut that protest was unsuccessful - much like their objections to the court breaking for morning tea, and their attempt to close the court while video of the council clean-up was played.\n\nDuring cross-examination of Sgt Faber, Elena asked why her sister wasn't arrested at earlier violations of the 10-metre perimeter.\n\n'At that stage, you are on the nature strip side and I had somewhat control,' the sergeant replied.\n\nLiana objected to a police officer describing piles of material strewn through the property's front yard as 'rubbish'\n\n'You're obstructing me, Magistrate Trad,' Liana said. 'Thank you for your opinion and legal expertise on my conduct,' came the reply\n\n'(Then) your sister has jumped the fence and gone straight to where they are working with ... shovels and whipper snippers.'\n\nRepeatedly warned to only ask about relevant matters, the sisters were granted a 20-minute adjournment to compose their questions.\n\n'I am not your legal representative and you have had an opportunity to get legal representation since 2015,' Ms Trad told the pair.\n\nBut Liana persisted in her cross-examination, asking the police officer to define words on a 2015 court-issued order permitting the property clean-up.\n\nMs Trad refused the question to be answered.\n\n'You're obstructing me, Magistrate Trad,' Liana said.\n\n'Thank you for your opinion and legal expertise on my conduct,' came the reply.\n\nMs Trad eventually reached her limit after Sgt Faber was asked to define 'a fence'.\n\n'Okay, take a seat,' the magistrate said.\n\n'The cross-examination is terminated.'\n\nThe hearing will resume on Wednesday.", "description": "Two of Sydney's best-known hoarders will continue their self-represented battle to have fines thrown out in court, alleging they obstructed police during a council-led clean-up.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Australia Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20059954-0-image-a-7_1571785200002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
