The move came after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration called out the company for illegally selling tobacco products to minors.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe regulator also called out other retailers like Kroger (KR.N), Family Dollar, which is owned by Dollar Tree (DLTR.O), 7-Eleven, Casey\u2019s General Stores and Sunoco (SUN.N), which were among more than half a dozen convenience store and gas station chains cited for illegally selling tobacco products to minors.\n\nThe companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they plan to follow Walmart\u2019s decision and stop selling the products.\n\nWalmart shares were little changed in late trading, while shares of Altria Group Inc (MO.N) were up nearly 2%.", "description": "Walmart Inc told staff on Friday it will stop selling e-cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery products at its U.S. stores, amid a growing crackdown on surging teenage use of such products, reports of vaping-related lung disease and some deaths.", "authors": ["Nandita Bose", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432093845&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1U8", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
