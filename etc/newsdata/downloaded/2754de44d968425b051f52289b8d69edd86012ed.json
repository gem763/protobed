Loose lips likely played a role in the current CIA \"whistleblower\" uproar. (Wikimedia)\n\nBy Eric Felten, RealClearInvestigations\n\nOctober 3, 2019\n\nAs Democrats in Congress assess a CIA analyst\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d allegations against President Trump regarding Ukraine, one thing already seems clear: There has been a breakdown within the government of traditional restrictions against sharing intelligence beyond those with a need to know it.\n\nRobert James Hanssen: Perhaps America's worst turncoat spy ever, he made a point of trivial need-to-know breaches. If no one noticed, that told him he wasn't under suspicion.\n\nUnlike most whistleblowers, the CIA analyst was not a witness to events. Instead, he functioned as a kind of investigative reporter who worked sources to develop the information detailed in the complaint. While some have praised the informer for unearthing questionable behavior by the president, some experts in national security law say that the whistleblower and his sources may have violated regulations aimed at preserving state secrets.\n\nExperts also say this breakdown was almost inevitable. Restrictions on information sharing were reinforced in response to some of the biggest spy breaches in U.S. history \u2013 involving Robert Hanssen, Aldrich Ames and Harold James Nicholson, among others. But they were undermined after 9/11 when government officials concluded that closer communication among various agencies might have helped it prevent the attacks.\n\nRobert Eatinger, former senior deputy general counsel at the CIA who now leads the national security law practice at Dunlap, Bennett & Ludwig, said the basic rule is two-fold: 1) you don\u2019t share classified information with someone who doesn\u2019t have a sufficient level of clearance; and 2) you don\u2019t share with someone who doesn\u2019t have an official need to know the information.\n\nThis helps explain why \u201cmost whistleblower complaints are about first-hand experience,\u201d says attorney Sean Bigley, who specializes in such whistleblower actions and in defending those at risk of losing their security clearances. He says that is preferable not just because an eyewitness is generally more credible, but because the sharing of classified information can itself be against the law. For example, it could matter where the information was discussed. If the information was classified top secret, for example, any conversation about it would have to take place in a surveillance-proof room called a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. Bigley says that\u2019s not a problem when someone with direct experience files a whistleblowing complaint, and he wonders why none of the whistleblower\u2019s sources were willing to come forward.\n\nIn his complaint, the CIA analyst states that he \u201cwas not a direct witness to most of the events described.\u201d If the whistleblower had a \u201cneed to know\u201d the information that was troubling, he could have accessed the transcript and intelligence himself. Instead he was told about it by anonymous \u201cofficials\u201d at the White House and State Department.\n\nThe CIA analyst claims that he came by the information legitimately, claiming \u201cthe information provided herein was relayed to me in the course of official interagency business.\u201d But though a meeting may have an official purpose, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s free game to share any and every piece of classified information.\n\nHis complaint also makes clear that he was not passively accepting reports from others but actively pursuing information. \u201cOver the past four months,\u201d he writes, \u201cmore than half a dozen U.S. officials have informed me of various facts related to this effort [to pressure Ukraine].\u201d These seven-some officials are fonts of information:\n\n\u201cMultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI also learned from multiple U.S. officials that\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. officials characterized this meeting\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSeparately, multiple U.S. officials told me that\u2026\"\n\n\u201cI was told separately by multiple U.S. officials that\u2026\"\n\nThere are more examples \u2013 page after page of them -- perhaps an effort to make the chorus of chatty officials seem more compellingly numerous than they are. In \u201calmost all cases,\u201d according to the whistle-blowing complaint, \u201cmultiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another.\u201d\n\nHow have officials with clearances become so casual in sharing classified information? Widespread disdain for President Trump within the federal bureaucracy, particularly within the intelligence agencies, may be a factor. But apparently something else was happening as well, namely a long-standing failure to rein in the rumor mill. It seems that security clearances are rarely revoked for over-sharing with colleagues.\n\nEatinger says that there are many reasons one might lose a security clearance. \u201cIt runs the gamut from psychological issues to the salacious,\u201d he says.\n\nOne of the most common reasons government workers are stripped of their clearances is that they have been caught lying about when they got to work and when they left. Time and attendance fraud is vigorously policed and ruthlessly punished. Losing one\u2019s security clearance over T&A (as it is known to federal employees) is a \u201ccareer death sentence,\u201d Eatinger says.\n\nBy contrast, in handling years\u2019 worth of cases involving loss of clearances, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything to do with talking out of school\u201d or anything to do with discussing secret information with a fellow official who lacks a need to know that information.\n\nThat\u2019s consistent with the experience of lawyer Elaine L. Fitch, who practices security clearance law at Kalijarvi, Chuzi, Newman & Fitch, and who co-authored the fourth edition of the book \u201cSecurity Clearance Law and Procedure.\u201d \u201cThe biggest issues we see are financial,\u201d she says. Workers are considered insufficiently reliable for a clearance if they have \u201ctoo much debt\u201d in their personal lives, potentially making them vulnerable to offers of cash for secrets.\n\nFormer FBI director James Comey hasn't been punished for leaking to the media. The government is hesitant to punish top officials who share information.\n\nThe fact that few government officials are losing their clearances because of inappropriate sharing doesn\u2019t mean that everyone is holding classified information close. Instead, it suggests that the lines are often blurred and, as has been revealed in cases involving former FBI Director James Comey and others leaking classified information to the press. The government is hesitant to punish top officials who share information, who under law are subject to reprimand, suspension without pay, or removal, among other penalties.\n\nIf the whistleblower had a need to know the information, he likely would not have needed White House and State Department \u201cofficials\u201d to provide it to him surreptitiously. But information such as read-outs of presidential phone calls are not normally left out for just anyone to peruse. Eatinger says that in his time at the CIA, which included interacting with the NSA, \u201cI never saw a transcript of a president\u2019s call with another country\u2019s president.\u201d He finds it \u201csurprising that contacts shared that information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is truly endangered now is the ability to keep anything secret,\u201d intelligence scholar Bowman H. Miller wrote in the journal Studies in Intelligence in 2011. After 9/11 there was a push to end \u201cthe \u2018stovepiping\u2019 and bureaucratic hoarding of national security information,\u201d he wrote. The need to share replaced the need to know. Miller lamented that the lack of secrecy would hobble intelligence analysts\u2019 \u201cability to write for or brief policymakers and decisionmakers with as much candid, relevant information as possible.\u201d\n\nFitch cautions that as important as confidentiality may be, one doesn\u2019t want secrecy used to cover up wrongdoing. One solution to that tension is for actual witnesses to go directly to inspectors general or Congress, who have a legitimate, official need to know.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason altogether for hewing to the need-to-know basis for sharing intelligence. It has proved to be an effective way to spot \u2013 and thwart \u2013 spies.\n\nIn 2003, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general released \u201cA Review of the FBI\u2019s Performance in Deterring, Detecting, and Investigating the Espionage Activities of Robert Philip Hanssen.\u201d The IG found that the longtime FBI mole had made a point of making trivial violations of need-to-know rules: If no one noticed, he was able to assume he wasn\u2019t under suspicion.\n\nThe inspector general stressed that an institutional tolerance for breaking simple security rules, both at the FBI and the State Department (where Hanssen was detailed) made the institutions vulnerable. \u201cHanssen continued to commit security violations while at the State Department,\u201d the IG reported. \u201cHe improperly disclosed classified information to others \u2013 including NSA and State Department employees, close friends, and members of the press.\u201d\n\nBut it was through the unauthorized access of an FBI computer database that Hanssen did the most damage. The IG urged the FBI to \u201cimplement measures to improve computer security, including \u2026 procedures designed to enforce the \u2018need to know\u2019 principle in the context of computer usage.\u201d\n\nHarold James Nicholson: The Russian asset pursued information he didn't have a need to know, and drew suspicion.\n\nCIA instructor Harold James Nicholson was a Russian asset for years. In April 1996, his efforts to gather information on Chechnya \u2013 information he had no need to know \u2013 brought him under greater suspicion even than his excessive spending. In November of that year the FBI searched Nicholson\u2019s office and found documents about Russia. They weren\u2019t beyond his clearance level, but neither were the documents about anything he had a need to know. It was the giveaway that led to Nicholson\u2019s arrest later that month.\n\nTo the extent that damage done by notorious double-agent Aldrich Ames was limited, it was because of what was then a robust CIA culture of sharing information only with those who could demonstrate they needed it. Ames later told the Senate Intelligence Committee there were things \u201cI couldn\u2019t get access to\u201d because the organization\u2019s \u201cculture of compartmentation\u201d was strong. \u201cIf you have a need to know something you are upfront and you say I need to know this or you go to someone and get permission to get it, but you don't say to someone in the hall \u2026 \u2018Anything exciting happen last week?\u2019 You don't do that. And I never did.\u201d\n\nNone of this is to suggest, as Trump has, that the whistleblower is any kind of spy. Rather, it is to point out that there are serious considerations behind the rules restricting the sharing of classified information with those who have a need to know it. If the whistleblower\u2019s tale tells us anything, it\u2019s that some in the intelligence community have become blas\u00e9 about over-sharing. It\u2019s a bad habit, one that \u2013 at a time when bad actors are prodding us in search of institutional weaknesses -- undermines our defenses.", "description": "Above, an old wartime poster's warning against unguarded talk.
