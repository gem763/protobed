It can cause cancer,\u201d she told the ABC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fearful and it should be concerning for all of us,\u201d said Brockovich, whose own anti-pollution fight became the subject of a Hollywood film starring Julia Roberts.\n\nPFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemical substances found in a wide range of products such as fire retardant.\n\nThe health impacts of the substances are debated. The US Environmental Protection Agency has called them \u201cpossibly carcinogenic\u201d but Australia\u2019s health department says there is \u201cno conclusive evidence\u201d to support a cancer link.\n\nShine Lawyers argues that Australian residents have been unable to move away from PFAS-leeching army bases, as their properties are now deeply unattractive to prospective buyers.\n\nThree other class actions against the defence department are already under way in relation to PFAS contamination, officials said.", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 Tens of thousands of Australians are suing the government over chemical contamination of land, with the support of US advocate Erin", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/609cfd_us-actress-julia-roberts-won-an-oscar-in-2000-her-portrayal-title-character-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
