Nadler is eager to impeach President Trump", "language": "en", "text": "If you watched the hearings featuring Corey Lewandowski yesterday then you\u2019re already aware that Rep. Jerry Nadler is leading the Democrats\u2019 charge to impeach President Trump. That drive has led to some behind-the-scenes conflict with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who has done her best to protect moderate Democrats who can point to internal polling which shows most voters don\u2019t think impeachment should be a priority. Today, Politico reports Pelosi herself echoed those concerns last week:\n\nIn a closed-door meeting last week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi stunned lawmakers and aides with a swipe at Democratic staff on the House Judiciary Committee. Pelosi criticized the panel\u2019s handling of impeachment in harsh terms, complaining committee aides have advanced the push for ousting President Donald Trump far beyond where the House Democratic Caucus stands. Democrats simply don\u2019t have the votes on the floor to impeach Trump, Pelosi said. \u201cAnd you can feel free to leak this,\u201d Pelosi added, according to multiple people in the room. Pelosi\u2019s office declined to comment on the meeting.\n\nBut despite the Speaker\u2019s foot-dragging, Rep. Nadler continues to pursue Oversight hearings styled as impeachment investigations. It turns out there is a very practical reason for Rep. Nadler\u2019s fixation on impeachment, one which helps to explain his willingness to court disaster for his moderate colleagues.\n\nSeveral Democrats have speculated that Nadler\u2019s hard line on impeachment is partly driven by concerns with his political standing on the left in his New York City district as he faces his toughest primary challenge in decades. Nadler has also come under intense pressure from Trump\u2019s fiercest critics on the Judiciary Committee who have actively lobbied for impeachment for months.\n\nThe primary challenge in Nadler\u2019s district comes from three different women who are partly by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 victory over Joseph Crowley. The leading challenger is Lindsey Boylan who has made Nadler\u2019s reluctance to embrace impeachment the focus of her campaign. In July, Politico highlighted Boylan\u2019s campaign:\n\nWhile Nadler has pushed his party leadership behind the scenes to move on impeachment, Boylan is aiming squarely at Nadler\u2019s reluctance to publicly support an official House inquiry against Trump \u2014 and she\u2019s using the issue to great effect. The 35-year-old candidate took in $264,657 in donations in the second quarter of this year, the most among the growing crop of primary challengers looking to unseat members of Congress around New York City\u2026 But the knock against Nadler \u2014 who will be a central character when Special Counsel Robert Mueller testifies before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on Wednesday \u2014 isn\u2019t just about Medicare for All, the Green New Deal or immigration. It\u2019s about the perception among some progressives that he isn\u2019t thirsty enough for Trump\u2019s blood\u2026 \u201cWe need a leader, not a follower,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to place the blame on someone else, Nancy Pelosi. I don\u2019t think that is a way to lead.\u201d\n\nYou can see two examples of Boylan\u2019s focus on Nadler and impeachment in one of her ads below. But in addition to the heat coming from Boylan, Nadler has also been pressured by billionaire Tom Steyer who held an impeachment town hall in Nadler\u2019s Manhattan district back in February:\n\nSteyer\u2019s Need to Impeach PAC held a town hall in Nadler\u2019s Manhattan district Tuesday evening, and the group is running a 30-second television ad powered by a six-figure digital buy encouraging Nadler\u2019s constituents to press him to back immediate impeachment\u2026 \u201cThey voted for Congressman Nadler because they want some action,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why they turned out.\u201d\n\nOf course, a primary challenge to Nadler, who has served in Congress since 1992, is still a long shot. But AOC showed that by running to the left, it can be done. Nadler may not admit it but he must be privately concerned that Boylan\u2019s impeachment push could turn the 2020 election into a real challenge. But of course, he can blunt the impact of that challenge by becoming the face of the impeachment drive. That may not be good for House Democrats, especially the moderates who are being dragged along, but there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s good for Jerry Nadler.\n\nThis first ad titled \u201cImpeachment Now\u201d was released in mid-July. The ad only has a handful of views on YouTube but the same clip received thousands of views when she shared it on Twitter.\n\nHere\u2019s another video Boylan released on Aug. 1:", "description": "\"...he isn\u2019t thirsty enough for Trump\u2019s blood.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Nadler-yelling.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
