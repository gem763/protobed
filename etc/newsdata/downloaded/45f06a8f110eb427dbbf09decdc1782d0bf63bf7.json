But through Oct. 22, real estate is the 12-month champion among the S&P 500 SPX, +0.28% on a total-return basis (with dividends reinvested).\n\nBefore getting into real-estate companies\u2019 performance, here are the main sectors in the benchmark index:\n\nS&P 500 sector Total return - 12 months through Oct. 22 Total return - 3 years Total return - 5 years Total return - 10 years Total return - 15 years Weighted aggregate dividend yield Real Estate 32.0% 42% 67% 297% 285% 2.99% Utilities 22.8% 49% 74% 216% 343% 3.07% Information Technology 16.1% 84% 140% 369% 473% 1.47% Consumer Staples 15.5% 28% 53% 207% 334% 2.81% Consumer Discretionary 13.7% 58% 98% 398% 384% 1.33% Communications Services 12.4% 19% 33% 158% 177% 1.35% Financials 11.4% 53% 71% 175% 77% 2.20% Materials 11.0% 29% 32% 128% 206% 2.23% Industrials 9.5% 42% 63% 246% 256% 1.94% Health Care 3.0% 39% 58% 281% 349% 1.79% Energy -14.1% -8% -18% 25% 120% 4.10% S&P 500 Index 11.0% 49% 72% 238% 273% 1.97% Source: FactSet\n\nAttractive dividend yields are the obvious connection between the real-estate and utilities sectors. The energy sector also sports a high aggregate dividend yield. However, oil-price uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on energy companies.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that the real-estate sector\u2019s performance has typically been good or better when compared with other sectors over long periods.\n\nReasons for outperformance\n\nThe flight to yield continues. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% has fallen to 1.75% from 3.20% a year ago, and Bloomberg has estimated that the total debt in Europe and Japan with negative yields to maturity exceeds $17 trillion.\n\nIn his daily \u201cOut of the Box\u201d opinion piece Oct. 21, B. Riley FBR chief global strategist Mark Grant wrote that many large institutional investors are \u201cgoing through massive reallocations of assets programs, as they try to deal with lowered bond returns.\u201d This means a continued flow of money into the U.S., with higher-yielding securities being especially attractive.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve cutting short-term rates twice recently and reversing its decision to shrink its balance sheet earlier this year, along with continued stimulative central bank policies in other developed economies, there\u2019s no reason not to expect the big money flow to continue, along with plenty of support for shares of real-estate investment trusts.\n\nS&P 500 REIT stocks\n\nThe S&P 500\u2019s real-estate sector is made up of 31 REITs and one real-estate development company: CBRE Group CBRE, +1.28%. Here\u2019s the entire list, sorted by dividend yield, along with trailing FFO yields.\n\nYou can click on the tickers for more about each company, including its business profile.\n\nFFO stands for funds from operations, which is a non-GAAP measure used by REITs to gauge dividend-paying ability. FFO adds depreciation and amortization back to earnings, while subtracting any gains on the sale of investments. We can calculate the FFO yield by dividing the past 12 months\u2019 FFO by the current share price. If the FFO yield exceeds the dividend yield, it appears there is \u201cheadroom\u201d to raise the dividend, or at least maintain the current payout. If the FFO yield is lower than the dividend yield, you had better find out why \u2014 is this a temporary decline for a specific reason?\n\nFor a few of the companies, FFO figures weren\u2019t available, so we used trailing free cash flow yields instead. A company\u2019s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. Free cash flow yield figures appear in the FFO yield column for CBRE Group and Weyerhaeuser WY, +1.30%.\n\nIncome-seeking investors may be excited by some of the high yields at the top of the list. But beware \u2014 some of the highest-yielding REITs are also some of the worst-performing, at least recently. This is why, before considering an individual REIT investment, you need to do your own research to understand a company\u2019s specialty, that particular industry and think about whether the company\u2019s long-term strategy seems reasonable.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 ratings\n\nHere\u2019s the list again, in the same order, with a summary of sell-side analysts\u2019 opinions:\n\nREIT ETFs\n\nFor investors who want broad exposure to U.S. REITs, there are many exchange traded funds available. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the distribution yields include capital-gains distributed as part of the ETFs\u2019 dividends. If you consider an ETF, read carefully about the nature of the dividend distributions and consider tax consequences. Here are six REIT ETFs as examples:\n\n\u2022 The SPDR Real Estate Select Sector ETF XLRE, +0.17% holds the 32 stocks in the S&P 500 real-estate sector and has a distribution yield of 2.85%, net of annual expenses of 0.13% of assets. The portfolio totals $4.1 billion.\n\n\u2022 The SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF RWR, +0.25% has $2.7 billion in assets and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index. The ETF holds 95 stocks. Its distribution yield is 3.19% and the annual expense ratio is 0.25%.\n\n\u2022 The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF SCHH, +0.25% has $6.1 billion in assets and also tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index. It has a distribution yield of 2.67% and a 0.07% expense ratio.\n\n\u2022 The iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF IYR, +0.14% has $4.83 billion in assets and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index, holding 115 stocks.

The portfolio has $2.4 billion, the dividend yield is 2.32% and the expense ratio is 0.34%.\n\n\u2022 The Vanguard Real Estate ETF VNQ, +0.22% is huge, with $47 billion in assets as it tracks the MSCI U.S. IMI Real Estate 25/50 Index by holding 183 stocks. According to FactSet: \u201cThe only place it deviates is the persistent sector bias away from specialized REITs in favor of commercial REITs.\u201d Vanguard quotes a distribution yield of 2.95% as of Sept. 30. The expense ratio is 0.12%.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How to identify U.S. stocks with attractive growth potential\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "Negative yields abroad keep the money flowing into U.S. stocks, especially those with attractive dividends.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT885_PSA_20_ZG_20191023163824.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
