AAPL -1.46% \u2019s store in Beijing\u2019s trendy Sanlitun neighborhood was crowded Friday with shoppers checking out the latest iPhones\u2014but the real test for the iPhone 11, analysts say, will be whether it can sustain interest in the months ahead as trade tensions simmer and competitors release 5G handsets.\n\nApple stores world-wide began selling the new iPhones Friday. The base iPhone 11 model features a second-rear camera and a $699 price tag, $50 less than its predecessor\u2019s. The iPhone 11 Pro models feature the same starting price as their predecessors, $999, but offer a third rear camera and ultrawide photos.\n\nThe tech giant has been under fire in China, where phones with similar features and lower prices from Huawei Technologies Co. and others have sliced into its market share.\n\nSales in Greater China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, plunged 20% to $32.54 billion for the three quarters ended in June, the company reported in July. While that figure includes the iPhone as well as other Apple devices, executives have noted weakness in the performance of the company\u2019s smartphones in its second-largest sales market.\n\nIn a bid to end those declines, Apple introduced new iPhones this month that address camera and price, previous models\u2019 weaknesses in the eyes of consumers.\n\nCamera technology has become an important differentiator in China, where Huawei has walloped Apple and others, amassing a 38% smartphone market share in the June quarter, according to research firm Canalys, after introducing a triple-rear camera model last year. Meanwhile Apple had a 6% share of the market, ranking fifth among companies, and that percentage was down from the prior year.\n\nApple\u2019s best standing in China was in 2015 when it was the third-largest smartphone seller with a nearly 13% market share, according to Canalys data.\n\nThe iPhone Pro\u2019s triple-rear camera may help Apple catch up to its biggest Chinese rival and give customers a reason to pause before considering switching to Huawei.\n\nThe new features, along with the familiarity of using the iPhone, were enough to persuade 28-year-old Gao Zhenzhen to plan an upgrade from her iPhone 7 at the Apple Store in Sanlitun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m used to iPhones,\u201d Ms. Gao said.\n\nRelated Video From night shooting mode to ultra-wide lenses, Apple's latest iPhones have a bunch of new camera tricks.

Slashing $50 off the price of the iPhone 11 compared with last year\u2019s XR should help broaden the appeal of the company\u2019s lowest-priced new model. Apple also aggressively touted trade-in offers world-wide that further discount retail prices.\n\nThe lower prices and trade-in offer helped persuade Aaron Lee, 35, to buy a new iPhone 11 for around 3,100 yuan ($440) after trading in his XR model. \u201cThe price has reached a level where it\u2019s convenient enough,\u201d Mr. Lee said.\n\nMany consumers still consider Apple\u2019s phones too pricey.\n\nZhang Tao, a 46-year-old taxi driver in Beijing, prioritizes affordability in choosing mobile phones. \u201dThe features of domestic phones are getting better and better,\" said Mr. Zhang, who currently uses an Oppo R15.\n\nApple\u2019s challenges in China are expected to intensify as local handset makers introduce models with 5G, a new, speedier generation of wireless technology.\n\nHuawei introduced its Mate 30 model with 5G on Thursday and Xiaomi Corp. , Oppo and Vivo are expected to release 5G-capable devices before year-end.\n\nChinese consumers have been anticipating the arrival of 5G and consider it a core technology for a premium handset, said Mo Jia, a Shanghai-based analyst for Canalys. \u201cThis is, of course, a significant weak point for Apple in terms of premium smartphones,\u201d he said.\n\nApple also is battling U.S.-China trade tensions that could sour some Chinese consumers on U.S. brands. The company has largely stayed out of the crossfire, but its reliance on China for a fifth of its total sales makes it vulnerable if China retaliates against continued pressure from U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe combination of 5G and trade, as well as perceived lackluster features on the iPhone 11, has Nomura Instinet analyst Jeff Kvaal doubting Apple will gain market share in China over the next year.\n\n\u201cThis upgrade simply isn\u2019t all that dramatic,\u201d Mr. Kvaal said of the new iPhones. \u201cTypically, they offer refreshes with more dramatic upgrades than adding a camera.\u201d\n\nDow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.\n\nRelated Video As Apple tries to escape tariffs and the trade war, it is moving production out of China\u2014but not to the U.S. Here\u2019s how the tech giant has become so reliant on a global supply chain.
