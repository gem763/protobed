Subsequently, the illegal alien was given three life sentences. The child rape occurred while Munoz-Mendez was dating and living with the victim\u2019s mother.\n\nOn October 25, though, Munoz-Mendez walked out of the Rogers State Prison as a free man in Tattnall County, Georgia, after state officials mistakenly released him.\n\nThe prosecutor who helped convict the illegal alien told 11Alive that the prison must \u201crethink how they are handling their security and how they let people out by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nBefore being convicted of child rape in 2015, Munoz-Mendez was arrested in 2008 for drunk driving and again in 2011 for failure to appear in court. It is unclear why the illegal alien was not deported after his first arrest.\n\nNow, Munoz-Mendez is on the run and those with information on his whereabouts are encouraged to call the police.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
