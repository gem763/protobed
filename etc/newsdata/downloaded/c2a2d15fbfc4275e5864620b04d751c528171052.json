REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde\n\nSecurity forces in Africa\u2019s most populous country are trying to tackle a decade-long Islamist insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest and bloody clashes between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities over dwindling arable land in central states.\n\nAgnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said Nigeria was a \u201cpressure cooker of internal conflict\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe overall situation I have found is one of extreme concern,\u201d she told a news conference in the capital, Abuja, where she presented her preliminary findings following a 12-day visit to the country.\n\nCallamard said the police and military had shown an excessive use of lethal force across the West African country which, combined with a a lack of effective investigations and meaningful prosecution, caused a lack of accountability.\n\nShe said the country required changes in the judiciary, police and military to stop people resorting to violence in the absence of justice.\n\n\u201cThe lack of accountability is on such a scale that pretending this is nothing short of a crisis will be a major mistake. If ignored, its ripple effect will spread in the sub-region given the country\u2019s important role in the continent,\u201d she said.\n\nSpokesman for the ministries of justice, military and police did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Callamard\u2019s findings.\n\nThe Islamist insurgency waged by Boko Haram began in northeast Nigeria in 2009 but has spread to parts of neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger where members of the group and militants allied to Islamic State carry out attacks.\n\nThe rapporteur also condemned what she said was the \u201carbitrary deprivation of life\u201d and the excessive use of lethal force in the case of processions held by banned Shi\u2019ite Muslim group the Islamic Movement in Nigeria.\n\nCallamard said the move to ban the group appeared be based on what the authorities thought IMN could become rather than its actions. She said she had not been presented with any evidence to suggest the group was weaponised and posed a threat to the country.", "description": "Nigeria's multiple security problems have created a crisis that requires urgent attention and could lead to instability in other African countries if it is not addressed, a United Nations rapporteur said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425669292&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF820IK-OZATP"}
