Based on that the Parliament and the citizens agreed to leave the EU. It is interesting that Scotland and Northern Ireland want to exert their independence, and in so doing have the United Kingdom lose its independence.\n\nUnfortunately the EU and the liberal opponents to Brexit prefer to keep the U.K. subject to control by the EU. The U.K. economy will survive and may even prosper with the cooperation of the United States and others.\n\nThe Obama administration and Democrats preferred to have the United States be subject to the whims of the EU, its policies and the loss of our\n\nsovereignty. The English should support Brexit for their own freedom and our citizens must support keeping our freedoms.\n\nMARVIN L.
