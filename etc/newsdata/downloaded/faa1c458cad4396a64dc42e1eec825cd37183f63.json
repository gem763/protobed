Within the span of a few days in February, both Democratic Governor Ralph Northam and Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax became embroiled in controversies that reopened the state\u2019s wounds and prompted virtually the entire Democratic Party in Virginia and beyond to demand their resignations.\n\nAfter a photo emerged from Northam\u2019s 1984 medical-school yearbook page that depicted a person in blackface and another in a KKK robe, the governor initially apologized for appearing in the photo but then reversed himself and has since denied that he was pictured. While Northam was fighting to save his job, two women accused Fairfax, his would-be successor, of sexually assaulting them in 2000 and 2004, respectively. Fairfax, who is just the second African American to be elected statewide in Virginia, has denied the allegations, comparing the rapid calls for his ouster to a \u201cpolitical lynching.\u201d Around the same time, the man third in line for the governorship, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, acknowledged that he, too, appeared in blackface during a college party decades ago.\n\nThe cascade of revelations made for a head-spinning week in Virginia and turned its Democratic Party into an object of national derision. Northam, Fairfax, and Herring, meanwhile, found an odd safety in numbers: While each man was damaged, all three survived\u2014and Democrats will have to work with them to pass legislation should they take control of the statehouse.\n\nEight months later, however, the scandals may not be the threat they once portended\u2014less an obstacle in the Democrats\u2019 path than an ugly spectacle they\u2019ve managed to drive around.\n\nRepublicans have predictably tried to use the scandals to preserve their slim majorities and a share of power, accusing Democratic candidates of hypocrisy for accepting campaign contributions from a governor they called on to quit. On the window of the entrance to the GOP\u2019s headquarters in downtown Richmond hangs a Wanted poster with Herring\u2019s face on it; the party is offering $1,000 to the first person to find and submit a photo of the Democratic attorney general in blackface.\n\n\u201cThe media wants us to move on. The Democrat Party wants us to move on. They think that voters won't care at all when it's brought up,\u201d says John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia Republican Party. \u201cThe issue plays,\u201d Findlay told me. \u201cFor a party that is self-professed to being obsessed with social justice and equality, their answer to these scandals is that the public has forgotten about them. That's the most cynical, nihilistic answer you could possibly have.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Democrats seem to be right: In a Washington Post\u2013Schar School poll released in early October, Northam\u2019s approval rating stood at 47 percent, with just 29 percent disapproving of his performance in office. That was a marked improvement from his standing in February. More people also approved than disapproved of the jobs Fairfax and Herring were doing. The same survey found that Democrats had a seven-point edge on the generic ballot among registered voters statewide in the House of Delegates and that gun policy was the most important issue on their minds.", "description": "Eight months after scandals rocked their party, Democrats are on the cusp of turning Virginia into an all-blue state.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/VADems_colorblock/facebook.jpg?1571003029", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
