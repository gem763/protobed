Charcoal (Courtesy National Gallery of Art, Washington)\n\nIn portraits in charcoal, handsome men and elegant women command attention.\n\n\u2018No more paughtraits,\u201d John Singer Sargent (1856\u20131925) wrote to a friend in 1907. Sargent was wry and honest. He was famous by then for his oil portraits of rich people. He\u2019d done a thousand of them, starting with the Paris nouveau riche social climbers and then British aristocrats and American plutocrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was a savant, famous at 25 for Madame X, and a wonderful, intelligent artist. At 50, though, he was sick of rich people. He\u2019d grown wealthy himself \u2014 painting those portraits \u2014 but finally declared independence. He wouldn\u2019t, he proclaimed, do any more portraits.\n\nWell, yes and no. Yes, for the rest of his life, he didn\u2019t do many portrait paintings. No, he never stopped doing portraits. The Morgan Library has a beautiful new show on Sargent\u2019s late charcoal portrait drawings from around 1905 through the early 1920s. The drawings aren\u2019t big. The cast is handsome men and elegant women, crisply done in thick charcoal with a minimalist background, sometimes heavy, vertical lines, sometimes next-to-nothing. Sargent\u2019s figures almost always have a sense of presence. He was a master in oil and watercolor and, the exhibition demonstrates, black and white, too.\n\nI\u2019d seen the Portrait of William Butler Yeats, from 1908, off and on over the years. It\u2019s gorgeous. Sargent loved depicting good-looking men. He shows them at ease, comfortably available. When I saw it at the Morgan Library with other Sargent drawings, the Yeats portrait looked very modern. Sargent gives us Yeats as the Edwardian \u201cArrow Shirt Man,\u201d or a Yeats billboard. The drawing illustrated a book of Yeats\u2019s poetry. It\u2019s minimalist \u2014 Sargent did it quickly \u2014 and it\u2019s also advertising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI brought a prejudice to the show. Sargent did these portrait drawings, by and large, to avoid painting commissions. He pushed people off, I thought, by doing quick drawings rather than studio oils. The Morgan Library show proved me wrong but not by much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are lots of beauties in the show. The Portrait of Helen Vincent, from 1905, is flamboyant, all flounce, curls, and curves. She was an English aristocrat. In looking, I thought about Thomas Gainsborough, and Sargent was, after all, Gainsborough\u2019s successor. She\u2019s among the coy beauties in the show. The Portrait of Ellen Peabody Endicott, also from 1905, is a power picture. She was an American, the wife of Grover Cleveland\u2019s secretary of war. She was from Salem in Massachusetts and a pure Yankee, from old Puritan stock.\n\nYou can look at the Endicott drawing in two ways. It\u2019s austere. Sargent emulated Gainsborough, Anthony van Dyck, and Thomas Lawrence in his English charcoal portraits. His subjects are high style and they ooze elegance. They float like clouds. His American portraits owe the most to John Singleton Copley. They\u2019re simpler and darker. Her clothes are architectural, built with layers of black lines, zigzagging and overlapping. Her face is inquisitive and plastic and charges forward. She floats like a battleship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn looking at these drawings, I thought about what\u2019s American about Sargent. Sargent thought of himself as an American, but he wasn\u2019t born here. His father was a medical doctor from Philadelphia with enough backup cash to take his young family on a Grand Tour in the early 1850s. Early in the visit, Mrs. Sargent declared she was allergic to steam so, of course, she couldn\u2019t travel on steamships, which meant she couldn\u2019t go back home, and she never did. Sargent was born in 1856 in Europe. He came to America for the first time in 1877. He needed to claim American citizenship before he turned 21. Until then, the Sargent family moved from place to place, Paris, Venice, Biarritz, depending on the social season and how much money they had.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo Sargent was the perpetual tourist. He saw things in snippets and had a good sense for the essence of his subjects. Ellen Endicott was a tough old Yankee. The medium of charcoal \u2014 black, earthy, and gnarly \u2014 suited her well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exhibition has drawings of Winston Churchill, Henry James, and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon before she became the queen. There are a lot of formula drawings in the show, with a likeness and a pattern of thick horizontal as a backdrop. I think the show is great. It\u2019s worth doing. Sargent, though, wasn\u2019t into most of these drawings. They were a side line.\n\nBy 1900, Sargent was busy with the big religious murals at the Boston Public Library. Around 1905, he started what I call the \u201crecumbent figure,\u201d scenes of his friends laying on the ground outdoors. After doing so many portraits \u2014 busts or standing figures or seated \u2014 he liked the challenge of depicting people laying down. He was a war artist, too, painting watercolors of air-raid scenes. He did the art deco\u2013style Museum of Fine Arts murals in Boston in the early Twenties. Some of the drawings in the show, such as the Portrait of Diana Manners, have a movie-poster look.\n\nSargent died suddenly in 1925. I was surprised to see how many of his subjects, like Manners, lived into the 1970s and 1980s. The drawings show at the Morgan Library is great.
