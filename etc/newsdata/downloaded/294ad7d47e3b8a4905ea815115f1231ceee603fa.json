A study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed a nearly 40-year period from 1979 to 2015, adjusting for inflation and changes in federal (but not state or local) taxes. The CBO found that wages grew for all income groups, from top to bottom, during the period. The rate of increase, however, was most dramatic for the top 1 percent, while everyone else saw relatively modest increases.\n\nAccording to PolitiFact, other studies show that the top earners have absorbed a growing share of all new income in the last 40 years. But the claim that wages have not increased in 40 years is unsupported by the data.", "description": "\u201cPeople haven\u2019t had a raise \u2014 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-washpost-wordpress-uploads/primetime/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/10/15183205/AFP_1LF9S5.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
