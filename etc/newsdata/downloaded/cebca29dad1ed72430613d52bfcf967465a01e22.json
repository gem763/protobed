For example, if you\u2019ve got a video that you want to post to YouTube, the Instagram grid, and Instagram Stories, you\u2019d currently have to manually edit that video for three different aspect ratios. Auto Reframe can automatically identify the main action happening in the video and crop and pan the frame around that footage to fit within ratios like square, vertical, or 16:9 videos. The feature, shown off today at the International Broadcasting Convention, makes use of Adobe Sensei, the company\u2019s artificial intelligence platform.\n\nAuto Reframe is an effect that can be applied to clips on Premiere\u2019s timeline, and users can choose between three motion presets (Slower Motion, Default, and Faster Motion) to let the algorithm to know how much movement to expect in the video. The effect will produce motion keyframes that follow the action in your content, which can also be manually adjusted for fine-tuning. It also does the convenient work of resizing text for each aspect ratio, which will save video editors a lot of time.\n\nAdobe has been adding more features to its Creative Cloud apps with social platforms in mind. Premiere Rush CC, the free mobile version of Premiere Pro, was made specifically with YouTube creators in mind, and it features exporting options that are optimized for different social networks, like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nAuto Reframe will arrive on Premiere Pro later this year.", "description": "Adobe previewed a new feature for Premiere Pro called Auto Reframe that automatically edits videos for square, vertical, and 16:9 aspect ratios.
