He said that everything hurt. I asked him his name and he said, 'My name is Mohammed'.\"\n\nThe Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's domestic security watchdog, warned in April of an estimated 2,240 Islamists with \"terrorist potential\" living in Germany.\n\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany party has seized on Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to leave the German border open to more than one million migrants and refugees in 2015-16, accusing her government of compromising national security.\n\nIt is now the biggest opposition party in parliament.", "description": "German authorities on Tuesday were investigating the motive of a Syrian man who hijacked an articulated lorry and smashed it into cars stopped at a traffic light in the city of Limburg, injuring several people.
