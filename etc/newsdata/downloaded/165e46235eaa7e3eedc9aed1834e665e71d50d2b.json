And now I sleep.\u201d\n\nThank you so much for watching! Appreciate the \u2764\ufe0f and support so much. \ud83d\udc83\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc83\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc83\n\nAnd now I sleep. pic.twitter.com/CzunQf6f1E \u2014 Jenny McC-Wahlberg (@JennyMcCarthy) September 23, 2019\n\nThe tweet was presumably meant to be cute, but some on Twitter didn\u2019t find it so amusing \u2015 especially since the \u201cMasked Singer\u201d judge had butchered an interview on the red carpet with Christina Applegate, who was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her role on Netflix\u2019s \u201cDead to Me.\u201d (Phoebe Waller-Bridge would end up winning that category for \u201cFleabag.\u201d)\n\nDuring their awkward exchange, not only did McCarthy, 46, coyly attempt to make Applegate, 47, appear much older than she is, but she also asked her how it felt to be \u201cnominated for your own show\u201d for the first time. McCarthy apparently didn\u2019t know that Applegate had been nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series twice before, for ABC\u2019s \u201cSamantha Who?\u201d\n\nWith this disaster of an interview fresh in their minds, people on Twitter sounded off at McCarthy. Many made references to her 2008 book \u201cLouder Than Words: A Mother\u2019s Journey in Healing Autism,\u201d in which she argued that vaccines weakened her son\u2019s immune system and sparked his autism. There is essentially no scientific basis to the idea that vaccines lead to autism, in spite of what McCarthy and others have said.\n\nKeep scrolling for more reactions to McCarthy\u2019s red carpet antics.\n\nWatching you bomb during that twin wreck was something. Dare I say apocalyptic? Do you feel ok? Perhaps you\u2019ve contracted some kind of virus that could\u2019ve easily been averted by, say, a vaccine? \u2014 Slightly Optimistic FinsFan (@nicko6568) September 23, 2019\n\nChristina applegate handled your ignorance so well yesterday. Glad you can sleep about it \u2014 peter the metor (@peterthemeteor) September 23, 2019\n\nApparently your knowledge of the Emmy nominations was equal to your knowledge of vaccines. I loved @1capplegate dragging you \u2014 Anne Madison (@madisonfive) September 23, 2019\n\nYou were HORRIBLE \u2014 Just me (@rudedogwon) September 23, 2019\n\n#ChristinaApplegate is not your senior \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f insert foot into big mouth \ud83d\udc44 \u2014 \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\udc89Schvanky\ud83d\udc89\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udf08\u2764\ufe0f (@Schvanky) September 24, 2019\n\nIs this the wicked witch of the west right before the house falls on her \u2014 Joan McNamara (@JoanieMcNamara) September 23, 2019\n\nYour interviews were painful to watch... pic.twitter.com/C1htiIfLGP \u2014 Maria (@NFW22b) September 23, 2019\n\nSorry but you suck at this job.
