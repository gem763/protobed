Here\u2019s Another Clue For You All", "language": "en", "text": "I&I Editorial\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office reported on Tuesday that, with one month to go, the federal deficit for fiscal year 2019 has already topped $1 trillion. As night follows day, Trump administration critics blamed the tax cuts.\n\nAnd once again, the data prove them wrong.\n\nThe CBO report says that the federal deficit reached $1.067 by the end of August. That\u2019s up $168 billion from the comparable period in fiscal year 2018. The deficit this year will be larger than the entire budget was in 1987.\n\nWhere did the increase come from? Why, tax cuts, of course.\n\nBut the report shows that revenues climbed 3.4% so far this fiscal year \u2013 a growth rate that\u2019s faster than GDP. Spending, however, shot up by 6.4%.\n\nLook within the data, in fact, and you see that the tax cuts are working as promised \u2013 by accelerating economic growth, they\u2019re at least partially paying for themselves.\n\nTake corporate taxes. Ask any Democrat running for president and they will bemoan the tax \u201cgiveaways\u201d to giant corporations. What they won\u2019t tell you is that corporate tax revenues are up 5%.\n\nIn fact, corporations paid $8 billion more in the 11 months of this fiscal year than they did in the same period of fiscal year 2018. That increase alone is enough to fully fund the Environmental Protection Agency for an entire year.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the CBO notes that corporate income tax payments through May were on 2018 activities. When you compare corporate taxes from June through August to same months last year, they are already up $18 billion \u2013 a 48% increase!\n\nMeanwhile, individual income and payroll taxes are up $82 billion \u2013 a 3% increase over the prior year. Payroll taxes alone, which are a good indication of how well the job market is because they are automatically deducted from every worker\u2019s wages, are up 6.4%.\n\nNow look at the spending side of the equation.\n\nThe CBO report shows that while revenues have climbed by $102 billion, spending shot up by $271 billion.\n\nThe entire increase in the deficit over last year is due to rampant spending increases, not the Trump tax cuts.\n\nSpending increases were across the board.\n\nSocial Security costs climbed 5.7%; Medicare, 6.5%; Medicaid, 4.6%.\n\nDefense spending is up 7.9%, but spending on everything else in the budget has climbed by 4.5%.\n\nHere\u2019s the really worrisome figure: Interest payments on the national debt is up 14% over the prior year.\n\nIt should go without saying that these levels of spending growth are unsustainable. Yet instead of confronting them, lawmakers and the Trump administration are aggravating them. Entitlement reform is a non-issue at the moment. Every increase in defense spending has to be matched with a hike in spending on domestic programs. The national debt continues to explode.\n\nAnd while Republicans appear indifferent to the debt explosion, Democrats are eager to more than double the size of the federal government, without saying how they\u2019d pay for that increase let alone bring existing annual deficits down to earth.\n\nTo paraphrase Herbert Stein, something that can\u2019t go on forever, won\u2019t. The only question is when it won\u2019t.\n\n\u2014 Written by John Merline\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
