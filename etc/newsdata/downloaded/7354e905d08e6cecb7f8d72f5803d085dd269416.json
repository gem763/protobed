He emphasized that Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson \u2015 who was appointed by Trump \u2015 identified the report as \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet in the face of this dire warning and the Trump Administration\u2019s effort to cover it up, the Republican-led Senate has remained silent and submissive, shying away from this institution\u2019s constitutional obligation to conduct oversight,\u201d Schumer wrote.\n\nSchumer joins a growing list of top Democrats calling for the release of the complaint, which allegedly raised alarm over Trump\u2019s phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, during the July discussion, Trump asked Zelensky about eight times to help his attorney Rudy Giuliani with a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, believing it could hamper the Democratic candidate\u2019s White House bid.\n\nThe complaint is now in the hands of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. He is required by law to send whistleblower complaints to the House and Senate intelligence committees within seven days, but Maguire\u2019s lawyer has said that the Justice Department believes he can legally keep it under wraps, The New York Times reported.\n\nNow, Schumer is pushing for the report to be subpoenaed and for Senate hearings investigating why it was filed in the first place. He is also asking for a transcript of Trump\u2019s call and the names of administration officials who withheld millions in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nOn Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) released a letter of her own calling for the complaint to be handed to lawmakers, declaring that the administration\u2019s effort to keep it private could signal \u201ca new chapter of lawlessness.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) made similar calls last week.", "description": "The Senate minority leader said Republicans have \"remained silent and submissive\" in the face of troubling reports on Trump's discussion with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d891c032100006705dafafc.jpeg?cache=p96gnhdc5w&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
