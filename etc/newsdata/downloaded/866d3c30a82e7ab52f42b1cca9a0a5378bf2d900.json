Crispy, greasy salt and oil delivered via thin layers of starch, they make a mess of crumbs and grease. They\u2019re terribly delicious, extremely difficult to stop eating once you\u2019ve caved into the first, and likely to cause a carbohydrate crash and a sense of regret.\n\nPotato chips are great and awful, and we all know what we\u2019re getting into when we open a bag.\n\nSo how would you review one? Do you tell people chips are awful for their health and break down why? Do you get into the ethical practices of various potato chip companies, perhaps?\n\nOr do you go all-in on the other end of the spectrum, singing the praises of the perfect snack food, one that isn\u2019t as impressive as other snack foods but also isn\u2019t trying to be gourmet cuisine? I mean, sure, gourmet chips exist, but we all know it\u2019s the snack of the people.\n\nBorderlands 3, Gearbox Software\u2019s return to their most popular franchise, is a bag of potato chips. It\u2019s the series that popularised the loot shooter genre, marrying first-person gunplay with Diablo-style loot and skill trees. You collect gun after gun with the same mindless, dopamine-pumping pleasure of popping chip after chip in your mouth.\n\nIt is awful and wonderful and also white noise, an experience so commonplace and reptilian that you wouldn\u2019t call it the best gaming experience you\u2019ve ever had, but you\u2019d be down for it if someone put it out in a bowl.\n\nMuch like a bowl of chips, it also leaves a hell of a mess when the party\u2019s finally over.\n\nThe story in Borderlands 3 is the same as it\u2019s always been in Borderlands. Once again, you\u2019re a Vault Hunter, a mercenary/fortune seeker who shoots their way across the bandit-ridden wastelands of the planet Pandora.\n\nThe hope is that, in all this shooting, you will find your way to a Vault, an ancient repository of rumoured riches. (And, usually, there\u2019s a big nasty being in that Vault, watching over it all.)\n\nThis time around, you\u2019re answering a call from Lilith, one of the hunters from the first Borderlands who has since become commander of the Crimson Raiders militia that fights to protect civilians from bandit hordes and corporate overreach (corporations have armies in Borderlands). Also, of course, they want to loot those sweet, sweet Vaults. They\u2019re the good guys, kind of.\n\nNipping at your heels are the game\u2019s antagonists, Troy and Tyreen Calypso, twin siblings who have united all the bandits of Pandora under their cult of personality. They\u2019ve also figured out that there are other Vaults on planets elsewhere in the galaxy. Your mission: Get to those Vaults before they do.\n\nAs the Vault Hunter hero of this game, you get to choose between four characters, each with their own impressively elaborate skill trees filled with different kinds of abilities to level up.\n\nThere\u2019s Zane, the Operative who controls the battlefield with drones, clones and barriers. Moze, the Gunner, can summon a giant mech to pilot and outfit that mech with different cool weapons and upgrades. Amara, the Siren, can deal elemental damage by conjuring magical arms. And FL4K, the robot Beastmaster, has tamed a number of wild creatures who fight alongside them.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to dig into, and like the first several potato chips in the bowl, it\u2019s absolutely delicious at first.\n\nToo Many Guns, But In A Fun Way\n\nUnlike the tactical realism of a Ghost Recon, or Destiny\u2019s system of arcane perks that only serve to make their sci-fi creations better at shooting, Borderlands\u2019 guns are toys. They\u2019re garish in shape and colour, digital creations that exist to solve digital problems. It\u2019s the best.\n\nLook at this stupid and impractical gun. It\u2019s great.\n\nBorderlands\u2019 approach both side-steps and doubles down on the gun fetishism that comes part and parcel in video games about shooting by making it all one big crass joke: Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to have an arsenal of impressive and interchangeable dicks that could also file your taxes?\n\nFinding a good Borderlands gun feels like cheating, as though you found an endgame weapon 20 hours too early. My first legendary sniper rifle was an absolute beast of a weapon that fired three incendiary projectiles at once but only consumed one bullet at a time. I got it at the end of the game\u2019s first act, and it remained a staple of my firefights right up through the credits.\n\nThis is the high that Borderlands offers, and it feels great, but like any high, it cannot last. The experience of playing Borderlands often devolves into a hunt for the next fix, and the longer it takes to get that fix, the more time you have to resent the game for not giving it to you.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve tasted the high of an unexpectedly power-packed weapon, trying out more of the \u201cnormal\u201d guns makes you feel kind of like a scrub, you know?\n\nGranted, \u201cnormal\u201d in Borderlands 3 is still pretty wild. When you have guns that turn into homing grenades, or crawling drone turrets, or bouncing balls that yelp \u201cow\u201d every time they ricochet off a surface, you\u2019d have to work very hard to have a boring firefight.\n\nThe game is built to encourage an endless search for the perfect loadout. What if I\u2019m missing out on the coolest gun I\u2019ve ever seen in a video game? I won\u2019t know until I find it, so I have to keep playing. But am I actually enjoying this? Or just chasing the high? It\u2019s hard to say.\n\nBorderlands 3 has some of the best locales in the series\u2014like my favourite, the Jakobs Estate.\n\nTucked away into the corners of Borderlands 3, I do find a lot to like. Its generous approach to sidequests, for example, rewards players with items but also with bespoke little stories.\n\nThere are whole regions of several maps that you\u2019ll only ever go to if you\u2019re pursuing a sidequest. They\u2019re like optional dungeons, there for those who want to do them, each offering something new to see along with a chance for more loot.\n\nBorderlands 3\u2019s soundtrack, which rarely makes itself known, has the benefit of offering occasional moments of delight when you stop to notice it. Like Borderlands itself, it can occasionally blast up into garish and annoying territory, but more often than not, it\u2019s a hidden gem, there for the finding.\n\nAfter I got clobbered by a giant sphere drone and tried to re-evaluate my loadout, I happened to notice a throwback club groove that sounds a lot like the chorus to Kiesza\u2019s \u201cHideaway\u201d, with a touch of the sax-and-dance vibe at the end of Japanese Breakfast\u2019s \u201cMachinist\u201d.\n\nOver on the swamp-world of Eden-6, I paused to take in a bit of ambient music that sounds like a Kate Bush synth cover.\n\nThese are little grace notes that show some personality in areas where other huge games might phone it in. There are some musical ideas I\u2019d love to groove to there, but the game quickly moves on to other ones, such as the (admittedly pretty good) running joke about a fictional modern jazz act.\n\nThe Borderlands Tone\n\nBorderlands 3 is marketed as a comedy, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what it truly wants to be. It\u2019s irreverent, sure. There\u2019s a very South Park-esque \u201ceveryone sucks\u201d vibe to the game\u2019s comedic beats.\n\nIt\u2019s just that the target of every joke is too lazy or too late. There\u2019s a scene making fun of hipster baristas, a character who\u2019s supposed to be a version of The Room writer/director/weirdo Tommy Wiseau, and an achievement list with titles such as \u201cOn Fleek\u201d.\n\nOh hi Mark.\n\nEven less flattering are the game\u2019s many comedic asides that make light of casual misogyny even as they exhibit an awareness of it. There\u2019s the man who purposefully misstates \u201cbitch\u201d instead of \u201cwitch\u201d when referring to a villain who\u2019s an actual swamp witch. Another character, after saying something that could be interpreted as sexual harassment, notes that he \u201cdefinitely attended that meeting\u201d.\n\nIt remains baffling and infuriating that the game continues to treat dwarfism as fodder for slapstick comedy, even though it has ditched an offensive term for little people that previous games used, replacing it with the made-up term \u201ctinks\u201d.\n\nOr that, despite this being an issue raised about a character in Borderlands 2, Borderlands 3 has a white character appropriating African American Vernacular English.\n\nOr that this game prominently features Chris Hardwick reprising his Tales From The Borderlands role of Vaughn despite public allegations of emotional abuse (not all of the other returning characters have their original voice actors back).\n\nWhile this is the garish shade with which Borderlands 3 colours itself, the game\u2019s overarching narrative is more interested in telling a sincere story that feels like a last hurrah for the cast of characters that have slowly developed over the past four Borderlands games. (And yes, Tales From The Borderlands is part of this farewell tour.)\n\nBorderlands 3 is casually and quietly inclusive, making it clear that a number of its heroes and villains are queer or nonbinary while also not calling too much attention to it. It\u2019s a story in which the heroes are mostly women\u2060 \u2014 women who lead and sacrifice and disagree and win.\n\nThere are jokes, but the story delivers its stakes with a straight face, and bets that players will be delighted at which characters will turn, and who they will miss.\n\nThe bummer is that, much like its comedy, the drama of Borderlands 3 doesn\u2019t really have a target it\u2019s willing to show teeth to. \u201cCorporations\u201d in the abstract sense have always been the overarching villain in Borderlands games, but they\u2019ve also been a target that Borderlands has always stood up to with the weakest of knees.\n\nIt is hard, after all, to make clean hits at massive companies for trampling people underfoot in an amoral quest for profit when the heart of your game is wholly dedicated to selfish plunder.\n\nThe specific antagonists of Borderlands 3, Troy and Tyreen Calypso, also feel like missed opportunities.\n\nBy making them shock-jock streamers who have amassed a cult following among the bandits of Pandora, Borderlands 3 gestures at the kind of unchecked influence YouTubers and livestreamers can have in our current media landscape, and how viral fame can also destroy those who it elevates.\n\nThe bones of something compelling are there, but Borderlands 3 lacks any of the conviction necessary to deliver on it. Its themes are as poorly developed as its sense of humour.\n\nIt\u2019s Still The Best At What It Does\n\nEven with their big entrances, most bosses you fight are pretty forgettable.\n\nDespite the proliferation of games such as Borderlands in the burgeoning loot shooter genre, there still isn\u2019t a big-budget game that does exactly what it does.\n\nIt\u2019s a massive offline Diablo-style first-person shooting game that can be joined at any point with friends, either online or on the couch. All of its serious competition \u2014 be it Destiny 2 or Warframe or The Division 2 \u2014 come with a pretty big deviation, namely a required internet connection.\n\nWhile the broad strokes remain the same, Borderlands 3 is a better Borderlands game than we\u2019ve ever seen, notably in the way that it opens up the endgame. There\u2019s the prerequisite new game plus that lets you keep your loot and skills to take on the story again, just harder and with better loot.\n\nBorderlands 3 BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE 'It's like playing through all your favourite memes from 2015!' TYPE OF GAME Rude and violent Supermarket Sweep reboot LIKED All that loot, generous sidequests, great endgame options. DISLIKED Underdeveloped plot, bad jokes, Claptrap. DEVELOPER Gearbox Software PLATFORMS PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC RELEASE DATE 13 September 2019 PLAYED Finished the main story in 28 hours, with some side-missions along the way.\n\nThere\u2019s also the new Mayhem mode, which allows you to go back into the world after the end of the campaign and clean up any side quests you have left, with stronger enemies and random modifiers that will buff certain weapons or enemy health, or debuff your stats.\n\nMaybe energy weapon damage is boosted while regular weapon damage is dialled back. Maybe your guns do more damage while your action skills do less. There are three tiers of Mayhem, each offering better loot in exchange for steeper modifiers. It\u2019s a terrific feature that makes going back and cleaning up leftover side quests \u2014 which, as mentioned, are substantial \u2014 feel so much more rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, on a technical level, Borderlands 3 is surprisingly bad at one of its core features: Inventory management. I\u2019m not merely referring to the interface, although it is a bit too cluttered and throws so many numbers at you that your eyes will glaze over after several hours of comparing loot. The bigger issue is performance.\n\nOn Xbox One X, the inventory screen stutters almost without fail. Sometimes there\u2019s a barely perceptible lag, and other times it takes a full three to five seconds for your guns to load in.\n\nInventory management is a disaster, but at least you can put together some pretty fly looks.\n\nThis may sound like a minor quibble, but it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s magnified when you play in split-screen. The rest of co-op play works well enough, although the same technical issues that you may encounter in solo play, such as lighting that doesn\u2019t properly adjust when you go from indoor to outdoor environments, will persist.\n\nThe real issue is the whole game grinds to a stop whenever one player opens up their inventory screen.\n\nI don\u2019t mean the game pauses when one player pauses. (The game only pauses in co-op when both players pause, which is a very nice feature.) I mean the frame rate drops to the damn floor and no one can move for a couple of seconds once someone opens their inventory.\n\nGiven how much of the game is devoted to inventory management, it\u2019s enough to make you want to tap out after a single co-op mission.\n\nI don\u2019t know how vital couch co-op is to the Borderlands community as a whole, but it is one of the reasons why I\u2019ve always kept a Borderlands game within reach. It\u2019s one of the last holdouts in the big-budget shooter space that has held on to split-screen co-op in a world where it\u2019s largely gone extinct (Gears 5 is another).\n\nTo me, it\u2019s part of the reason I even bother with Borderlands.\n\nSo, How About Those Chips?\n\nWhen a video game franchise has been around long enough, it establishes an identity in the public consciousness. That identity can become a defence against criticism. What did I expect, for a Borderlands game to not be Borderlands, with all the good and bad that comes with that?\n\nBorderlands 3 has what its predecessors had: The corny humour that doesn\u2019t always land, an unremarkable story and an endless loop of replacing your loadout with a slightly improved loadout. It\u2019s a relatively static experience in a franchise that hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot in the last 10 years. It is what Borderlands has always been, and everyone knows what that entails.\n\nThere\u2019s room for it in your life, just like there\u2019s room for a bag of potato chips in your pantry. They\u2019re great for parties, or carb emergencies. They\u2019re also unfulfilling, and don\u2019t contribute much to your health. We call it junk food for a reason.\n\nLike junk food, Borderlands 3 is an exercise in cheap hedonism. It isn\u2019t meant to take the place of a meal, but it still warrants criticism for being what it is, what it\u2019s always been: A compulsively playable shooter with some good ideas and also some frustratingly retrograde attitudes.\n\nThere\u2019s enough good here to understand why you\u2019d keep it around, but also enough troubling aspects that you could justify cutting it from your life entirely. But, even then, if you came across it at a house party, you\u2019d probably take a bite.", "description": "Take a bag of potato chips \u2014 any brand, anywhere \u2014 and you more or less know what you\u2019re going to get.
