But, after Yasmin was diagnosed with Leukaemia, that dream collapsed\n\nIn nine days the DIY SOS team swooped to transform the derelict old forge into a home fit for the brave family. Pictured above is the forge\n\nMany viewers said the show restores their faith in human kindness, while one called for Nick Knowles to be knighted\n\nThe uplifting show clearly had a big impact on viewers, with one tweeting: 'Best hour of TV this week. This programme shows the Britain we should be, not the country we are becoming. Keep up the amazing work!'\n\nA second said: 'We all convince ourselves the country is ripping itself apart then up comes an episode of DIY SOS to ground us all.\n\nAnd a third viewer emotionally wrote that nothing restores their faith in the kindness of strangers and the positive effect it brings more than watching the programme.\n\n'The community spirit, generosity of time and the sheer determination to help a family in need is uplifting. You are all fantastic!' they commented.\n\nThe team got to work by re-roofing the old forge and building a section to connect it to the main house, which was also standing vacant and without central heating or running water.\n\nThe team of volunteers then landscaped the gardens and decorated each room for its new occupants.\n\nAfter viewing the new home mother Tara said to the volunteers, while choking back tears: 'You've all made our house a home and we can all be back together again. Thank you so, so much'\n\nThe team added a roof to the derelict main room, pictured here, painted and decorated it, got the heating and water working, and added a kitchen area\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a This shows the transformation of the main room from when they got to work (left) to when they completed the development (right)\n\nThe main sitting room had a roof put on it and a roaring fire added for colder evenings, while the whole room was tastefully decorated to make it a modern living space fit for the family.\n\nThe parents were given a stunning bedroom with views over the garden, while Ben and Josh got their own 'lads pad' with a fridge, possibly for storing beer and chocolate, and Vinnie, Jess and Yasmin got their own bedrooms.\n\nThe stunning bungalow was designed so that it would be accessible for everyone, with wide spaces around the kitchen island to help Ben to get through in his chair, a big sliding front door and an accessible garden.\n\nWalking around the house for the first time after it was renovated, the tearful mother and father said they could not thank everyone enough.\n\nHordes of kind volunteers came to re-roof the forge, build a section to connect it to a separate property, and decorate the interiors\n\nOverjoyed mother Tara choked back tears as she said to the volunteers: 'You've all made our house a home and we can all be back together again.\n\n'Just looking around at you all, it's just amazing. Thank you so, so much.'\n\nAnd emotional father Chris said: 'Words don't seem enough. It's just unbelievable. What's been achieved here in nine days would have taken years.\n\n'We will be forever thankful, thank you very much.'\n\nSpeaking about what his favourite bit of the house, tearful Josh said: 'It's not our room, it's for mum and dad to be together. That's the one thing I wanted.\n\n'What you've done - all of you, and I mean all of you - is you've actually made us a family into one. That's all I've wanted. For all of us to be as a family.\n\nThe parents' bedroom upon completion looks absolutely stunning. They painted the walls and added bedside tables, lights, and a bed from which the parents had views over the garden\n\nA roaring fire, windows, curtains, and furniture were added to the main room (pictured)\n\nLuxurious sofas with comfortable cushions were added to the tastefully decorated property\n\nA family dining area was also put in, with a table that is accessible for son Ben who is in a wheelchair\n\nAnd Ben said, using speech software as he is unable to talk: 'My family mean the world to me and what you have all done, you have brought us all back together. We can't thank you enough for finishing our home.'\n\nHeartbroken viewers of the incredible programme agreed, with one tweeting that the programme sent them 'over the edge'.\n\n'We all worry and stress about the most trivial things', they said. 'Our life is a disaster if the wifi goes off. Try living in these people's shoes for an hour! The people that give up time and skills are the true heroes.'\n\nAn entire modern kitchen was also added, with enough space for son Ben to get his wheelchair around the kitchen island. The worksurfaces were also lower so that he could access them\n\nA second added: 'No one should have to endure what this family have gone through. Where on earth does the strength to carry on come from?'\n\nA third said: 'This always puts things in perspective when you watch this programme. It also restores your faith in humanity.'\n\nAnd a fourth person said: 'Just 10 minutes into DIY SOS and I am already about three cries in. How this family have coped with everything that has been thrown at them is beyond me.'\n\nThe family stood outside their new home to tell all the volunteers how happy they were that they could, once again, live together as a family", "description": "Emotional DIY SOS viewers fought back tears as the team helped transform a derelict forge in Yealmpton, Devon, into a family's dream home with disabled access for their children.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/11/20176204-0-image-a-160_1572000922604.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
