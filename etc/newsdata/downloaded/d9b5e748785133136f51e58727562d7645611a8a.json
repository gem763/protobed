From America to China, from Amazon to Alibaba, from Alphabet to Tencent, the most valuable and most dynamic companies in the world are technology companies. But what kind of capitalism? Because there are really two different modes, two ways to get rich.\n\nOne is to claim a share of the wealth that already exists. This is the capitalism of Wall Street, of Russia1, of cronies and rent-seekers, of the infamous \u201cresource curse.\u201d Obviously the more wealth there is around you, the more incentivized this approach becomes. Call it the siphon.\n\nThe other is to create new wealth; manufacture better goods, offer better services, design better hardware, write better software. This is \u2014 or is supposed to be \u2014 the capitalism of Silicon Valley, of China2, of rocket ships and electric cars, of Moore\u2019s Law. Obviously this is the purer, more idealistic form of capitalism. Call it the forge.\n\nIt seems apparent that public opinion has turned sharply agains the tech industry of late:\n\nThere's been a steep drop off in the share of Americans who say tech companies have a positive impact on the country \u2013 and this true among both Reps & Dems NEW from @pewresearch https://t.co/8PyowIvZeQ pic.twitter.com/Jw4KFWIk7D \u2014 Monica Anderson (@MonicaRAnders) July 31, 2019\n\nIsn\u2019t that surprising? After all, Silicon Valley is building new and better things for us all, while Wall Street, having offered essentially no generally beneficial financial innovations in decades, is greedily siphoning off roughly a quarter of all American profits; the pharmaceutical industry is spending vastly more on marketing than on R&D; and the rest of the US health-care industry is basically a huge kludge of a bloodsucking siphon.\n\nSo why has tech, the forge of the modern world, found itself in the crosshairs of a backlash?\n\nI put it to you that this is in part because while tech likes to portray itself as a forge, in many prominent cases, it is actually a siphon. Consider Facebook, Twitter, and Google. All are unquestionably forges, whose new products have done many good things. But that\u2019s not their business model. Their business model, their original sin, is that siphon called advertising.\n\nYou could once have argued that advertising is a forge, in that is makes consumers aware of desirable products, just as you could once have argued Wall Street was a forge, in that it makes capitalism more efficient. No longer, in both cases. Online display / social-media advertising has become the tech equivalent of high-frequency trading: a pure siphon. (You can, however, make a good case for Google\u2019s AdWords as a forge.)\n\nPeople know when they\u2019re being siphoned. What\u2019s more, the industry being siphoned from is the media, which is unsurprisingly now inclined to train its own guns on tech as a result.\n\nIt\u2019s not just ads. A more nuanced view is that \u201csiphon\u201d and \u201cforge\u201d are two ends of a spectrum, and numerous notable tech companies are closer to the former than the latter. Every app aimed at the wealthy-urbanite target market is essentially a siphon aimed at the wallets of the rich. (Yes, forge technology is often only affordable by the rich at first, too; but that\u2019s very different from servants-as-a-service.) WeWork was, apparently, largely a siphon for SoftBank.\n\nWhen people are angry at Amazon, Uber, and Lyft for how they treat warehouse workers, Whole Foods clerks, and drivers, it\u2019s in large part because it seems to them like the wealthiest industry in the world is acting like a siphon geared to drain the minimal wealth of struggling workers, rather than a forge building new systems to empower and enrich us all.\n\nOf course some of this criticism is unfair. And what almost every tech luminary really wants is to follow the Elon Musk model, wherein his stint at PayPal \u2014 which, like all payments companies3, is at least half siphon, albeit one largely aimed at even less appealing rivals \u2014 funded the forges of SpaceX and Tesla.\n\nBut all too often, the road to a siphon is paved with good intentions of a forge. Say what you want about Wall Street, at least they\u2019re not hypocrites; high-frequency traders and hedge funds rarely pretend to be making the world a better place for anyone but themselves and their clients. This perceived hypocrisy is especially acute for companies like Facebook and Twitter, which offer \u201cfree\u201d products from their forges \u2026 carefully engineered to optimize the siphons on which they survive.\n\nIn retrospect it\u2019s surprising it took this long for the tension between the siphon and the forge to erupt into the cultural dissonance in which social media, and gig-economy apps, and indeed much of the publicly visible tech industry, now exists. While that tension continues, it\u2019s hard to imagine this dissonance diminishing.\n\n1 An oversimplification \u2014 again, it\u2019s really more a spectrum than a binary \u2014 but not an invalid one.\n\n2 An oversimplification \u2014 again, it\u2019s really more a spectrum than a binary \u2014 but not an invalid one.\n\n3 Excepting those which create whole new kinds of payments, such as M-Pesa.", "description": "The tech industry has won at capitalism.
