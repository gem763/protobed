'But when you get into your 50s, it takes two to three months. Even if you apply the most amazing expensive cream, it's going on top of dead skin cells. It can't penetrate, so it won't work.'\n\nAn organic beauty pioneer, Charlotte didn't want to use chemical 'tweakments', so she started researching cutting-edge, scientifically proven botanicals that could delay ageing.\n\n'I knew I needed to find a way to exfoliate the skin without being too harsh. I love wrinkles, but I don't like dry, sagging skin.'\n\nWhile genetic ageing cannot be halted, natural aging products could delay ageing according to beauty pioneer Charlotte V\u00f8htz(file photo)\n\nA former nurse, Charlotte has a background in pharmaceuticals and is fascinated by science. But she also believes passionately in the power of nature.\n\nAfter six years of research, Charlotte, now 60, has just launched her signature range, Age Defy+ by Cha V\u00f8htz, a natural skincare regime that uses a blend of innovative plant-based alternatives aimed at skin aged 30, 40, 50 and beyond.\n\nShe believes that, while genetic ageing cannot be halted, women should not have to simply accept all this means for their skin. In her products she has combined botanicals, plant stem cells and scientifically proven phytoactives and she argues that women don't need Botox or other anti-ageing treatments \u2014 these blends of ingredients work in synergy to delay ageing and deliver just what the skin needs.\n\nShe has a track record in skincare. When her young daughter Sandra was battling multiple skin allergies and eczema, Charlotte founded the organic, plant-based skincare range Green People. She says: 'As any parent of a child with severe skin problems will know, it can be a long and frustrating battle to find treatments that work.'\n\nBack in the early Nineties, the dermatologists she saw suggested treating Sandra with steroids. 'But I knew that was only a temporary fix.'\n\nShe consulted a herbalist and biochemist and, once she started applying a potion containing 16 herbs, Sandra's skin began to clear up. By the time she started school, aged four, it was completely clear.\n\nCharlotte began developing tailored skin creams from her home, a converted barn in Sussex. And, in 1997, she launched Green People with a range of 30 organic products, including baby salves and shower gel.\n\nIt became the first cosmetic company to gain ethical status from The Good Shopping Guide. Since then, the range has expanded to 150 products.\n\nHaving tackled aggressive ingredients and synthetic chemicals, parabens and petrochemicals with Green People, it's no surprise she has no love for chemical alternatives.\n\nInstead, she prefers to work with youth-boosting botanicals and plant actives to boost collagen, target uneven pigmentation, reduce cell breakdown and diminish wrinkles.\n\nHere, she explains how anti-ageing plant extracts, among them pomegranate, hibiscus, neroli and sea holly, can be just as effective.\n\nSKIN-PLUMPER\n\nHibiscus has a reputation for increasing skin elasticity and has an incredible ability to inhibit the activity of the enzyme elastase, which is responsible for breaking down our skin's elastin\n\nSWAP: Botox for hibiscus. With its magical reputation for increasing skin elasticity, it's no wonder hibiscus is called the Botox plant.\n\nIt has an incredible ability to inhibit the activity of the enzyme elastase, which is responsible for breaking down our skin's precious elastin.\n\nHibiscus actively combats the ageing process by firming and lifting your skin, allowing it to 'snap back'.\n\nBecause of the slightly exfoliating effect of the organic acids found in the plant, hibiscus also helps speed up cell turnover, resulting in a more even-looking skin tone.\n\nIt can even help to control acne breakouts, bringing your skin back in balance for a gorgeous, glowing complexion.\n\nHibiscus also enhances the skin's ability to retain moisture, a key factor in keeping a youthful complexion.\n\nINSPIRE RECOMMENDS: Herbivore Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist 120ml, \u00a328, spacenk.com; Kiehl's Ginger Leaf & Hibiscus Firming Mask 100ml, \u00a344, kiehls.co.uk\n\nWRINKLE-BUSTER\n\nSWAP: Hyaluronic acid (a much-used additive in anti-ageing creams) for beech bud extract.\n\nBeech bud extract is an exceptional ingredient, rich in a range of substances that boost the metabolism, smooth the skin's surface and restore hydration.\n\nBeech bud is rich in a range of substances that boost the metabolism, smooth the skin's surface and restore hydration\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that the beech is known as the Everlasting Youth Tree.\n\nStudies suggest beech bud extract increases skin hydration by 30 per cent, while one trial showed a 10 per cent reduction of wrinkles over a four-week period.\n\nINSPIRE RECOMMENDS: Chantecaille Flower Harmonizing Face Cream 50ml, \u00a399, spacenk.com; Cha V\u00f8htz Age Defy+ Brightening Moisturiser with beech bud extract and cucumber 30ml, \u00a337, greenpeople.co.uk\n\nEXFOLIATOR\n\nSWAP: Alpha Hydroxy Acids, or AHA (chemical compounds used in abrasive cosmetic exfoliators) for pineapple extract.\n\nExfoliate dead skin cells by rubbing a thin slice of pineapple or papaya over your face. Leave for five minutes, then rinse off with tepid water.\n\nPineapple extract is rich in skin-boosting vitamins C and E and bromelain, a protein-digesting enzyme.\n\nPineapple extract is rich in skin-boosting vitamins C and E and bromelain and when applied to the skin this enzyme breaks down the protein bonds that hold dead skin cells on to the outermost layers of skin, exposing a younger, more vibrant complexion\n\nApplied to the skin, this enzyme breaks down the protein bonds that hold dead skin cells on to the outermost layers of skin, exposing a younger, more vibrant complexion.\n\nINSPIRE RECOMMENDS: Kiehl's Pineapple Papaya Facial Scrub 100ml, \u00a324, kiehls.co.uk; Glow Recipe Pineapple-C Bright Serum 30ml, \u00a346, cultbeauty.co.uk\n\nREJUVENATOR\n\nSWAP: Butylene Glycol (a type of alcohol used as a solvent in anti-ageing serums) for sea holly.\n\nA beautiful, purple, thistle-like plant, sea holly is amazing because it has evolved to survive in the harshest conditions.\n\nAn extract is obtained from cultured plant stem cells, which contain all the attributes of the whole plant and, as a result, have powerful regenerative and rejuvenating properties.\n\nAn extract obtained from the Butylene Glycol, a purple, thistle-like plant, contains powerful regenerative and rejuvenating properties\n\nSea holly stimulates and protects the skin's natural elastin and collagen, both of which decrease as you age, resulting in greater skin radiance and luminosity.\n\nIn a dermatologist-monitored trial involving 20 volunteers aged 35 to 60, skin tightening increased by 27 per cent, skin smoothness improved by 38 per cent and hydration increased by a remarkable 95 per cent.\n\nThis ingredient also has strong antioxidant activity, to protect skin cells from free radicals and inflammatory activity.\n\nINSPIRE RECOMMENDS: The Body Shop's Drops of Youth Concentrate \u2014 containing sea holly from the Brittany coast \u2014 100ml, \u00a326, thebodyshop.com; Cha V\u00f8htz Age Defy+ Line Eraser Serum 10ml, \u00a323, greenpeople.co.uk\n\nANTI-AGER\n\nSWAP: Dermal fillers for extract of the herb baikal skullcap.\n\nMuch-used in Chinese medicine, the extract baicalin comes from the roots of baikal skullcap, a herb in the mint and sage family native to East Asia.\n\nIt's an ingredient with remarkable anti-ageing properties in adults aged 30 or over.\n\nAt this age, the number of times that a skin cell can divide before eventually dying reduces by an average of 10 per cent per decade, owing to damage to structures within each cell called telomeres.\n\nThe extract baicalin comes from the roots of baikal skullcap and has remarkable anti-ageing properties in adults aged 30 or over\n\nIn infants and children, the telomeres are protected by an enzyme called telomerase, but this ceases to be produced once we reach adulthood.\n\nBaicalin re-stimulates the production of telomerase in adult cells, and restores skin to a more youthful state.\n\nINSPIRE RECOMMENDS: Cha V\u00f8htz Age Defy+ Hydrate & Renew Serum containing baicalin and willow bark 30ml, \u00a339, greenpeople.co.uk; Resveratrol B E, Antioxidant Night Concentrate, Skinceuticals, 30ml, \u00a3130, skinceuticals.co.uk\n\nHYDRATOR\n\nSWAP: Retinol (a popular chemical skincare ingredient) for squalane.\n\nSqualane is the saturated, or stable, form of the compound squalene, originally obtained for commercial purposes from shark liver oil, but today extracted from olive oil.\n\nSqualane was originally obtained for commercial purposes from shark liver oil, but today extracted from olive oil\n\nAdult skin is lubricated and protected against external aggressors by the sebum our skin produces. In healthy skin, sebum contains 10 per cent to 13 per cent squalene. This level drops as we get older.\n\nLow levels of squalene lead to dryness and flaking of the skin, and increase the risk of bacterial and fungal infections (eczema and psoriasis are also linked to low levels of squalene).\n\nOlive squalene conditions and hydrates the skin, making it plumper and silkier.\n\nINSPIRE RECOMMENDS: The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, \u00a311, boots.com; Facetheory Emolliating Olive Squalane,\u00a312.99, amazon.co.uk", "description": "Organic beauty pioneer Charlotte V\u00f8htz, 60,  believes passionately in the power of nature and after six years of research has just launched her signature range, Age Defy+ by Cha V\u00f8htz.", "authors": ["Liz Hoggard For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/20/19963890-0-image-a-20_1571599158527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
