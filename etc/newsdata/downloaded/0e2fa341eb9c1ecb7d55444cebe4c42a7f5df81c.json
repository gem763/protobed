That would imply that it\u2019s the nicotine pods that are causing a curious strain of lung problems in vapers, when in all likelihood, it\u2019s illegal THC-laced pods from the black market that are responsible. Naturally, both parties have joined forces to push the legal vape pods to the black market and make it just as easy as before to buy the illegal ones that might just kill you.\n\nYour resistance, legally speaking, is futile. Despite Juul\u2019s best efforts to fit in with Washington sycophants and bend the knee to our regulatory overlords, the FDA, the White House, and now the bloviating big government on both sides of the political aisle aren\u2019t budging in their misdirected ire. However, your market power is not.\n\nIt\u2019s time to vote with your dollars and prepare for the worst. Go to your local 7-Eleven, or even better yet, your neighborhood mom and pop vape shop and stock up on Juul pods.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tiana Lowe", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Go-Stock-Up-On-Juul-Pods"], "top_image": ""}
