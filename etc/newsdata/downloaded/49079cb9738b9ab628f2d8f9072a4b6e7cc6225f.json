While serving as vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general, who was then investigating the natural gas company paying Biden\u2019s son as much as $55,000 per month to sit on its board. Biden can be seen here bragging about his role in having the prosecutor removed.\n\nIn an era in which the left perpetually accuses Trump of corruption and nepotism, it would be an uncomfortable endeavor for the ;eft to explain how Biden\u2019s desire to fire Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor had nothing to do with the fact that the prosecutor was investigating his son\u2019s company.", "description": "", "authors": ["Erielle Davidson", "Thefederalist.Com Impeachment-Would-Be-Really-Stupid-But-Democrats-Probably-Will-Do-It-Anyway"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
