Our thoughts are with her family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.\n\n\"Judicial officers and staff are being supported, and appropriate counselling and support services are being provided. No further comment will be made at this time.\"\n\nLatrobe Magistrates Court in Morwell adjourned some cases yesterday to give staff time to deal with the news.\n\nPetrie and Higgins' relationship attracted media attention for their almost 40-year age difference, and last week the shadow attorney-general Edward O'Donohue wrote to the Judicial Commission of Victoria, calling into question Higgins' \"capacity to perform his judicial duties\".\n\nThe couple just announced their engagement last month, with Petrie posting pictures of their holiday in Fiji on Instagram.\n\n\"It started with a crush and now I have a ring on my finger,\" Ms Petrie posted on Instagram.\n\n\"The love of my life asked me to marry him and I said YESSSS.\n\n\"What an amazing 10 days it has been here in Fiji! I arrived as Rod's girlfriend and I leave as [Rod's] fiance! I cannot wait to become Mrs Higgins.\"\n\nMental health professionals are available 24/7 at the beyondblue Support Service \u2013 1300 22 46 36 or via beyondblue.org.au/get-support for online chat (3pm-12am AEST) or email response.", "description": "Ashleigh Petrie has died after being struck by a car in Victoria's east, weeks after announcing engagement to a magistrate.", "authors": ["Carolyn Tate"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d64505035ee26c7a53d82e5a5887e483", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
