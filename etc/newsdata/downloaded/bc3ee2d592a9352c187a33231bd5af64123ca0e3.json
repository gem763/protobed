The smart assistant might be enabled by default on your laptop, but if it\u2019s not, head to the Settings screen and choose Search and Assistant, then click Google Assistant (you can train the Assistant to recognise your voice, if you haven\u2019t already done this on another device).\n\nThe same options screen lets you choose whether a \u201cHey Google\u201d voice command is enough to wake up the Google Assistant on your chromebook. If you\u2019d rather use the keyboard instead, you need to hit Search+A or the dedicated Google Assistant key on the Pixelbook and the Pixel Slate.\n\nBeyond the usual Google Assistant tricks, Assistant on a chromebook can take care of a few jobs and requests that are particularly suitable for a laptop. Unlike something like a Google Home Mini, it can also return results on a screen. There\u2019s room for improvement \u2014 you can\u2019t really use Assistant commands to interact with Android apps on your chromebook \u2014 but here\u2019s what you can do already.\n\nGet more information about what\u2019s on screen\n\nThis isn\u2019t actually a command, but something you need to select manually: Get Google Assistant up with a \u201cHey Google\u201d or the keyboard shortcut, and when the Google Assistant panel pops up at the bottom of the screen, choose What\u2019s on my screen? with the trackpad or a tap on the display.\n\nThe Google Assistant then uses what\u2019s on screen as a search query. It\u2019ll identify famous people in images, for example, and pick up key terms inside text, bringing up useful website links and the option to run a further Google search on what your display is showing.\n\nScreenshot: Gizmodo\n\nCreate and find Google Docs\n\nThis one should come in handy if you spend a lot of time inside Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides: You can say or type \u201cHey Google, create a new document\u201d to have the Google Assistant do just that. (Use \u201cspreadsheet\u201d or \u201cpresentation\u201d instead of \u201cdocument\u201d to change the type of file that\u2019s created.)\n\nYou can also search through all the documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in your Google Drive by saying \u201copen,\u201d then the name of a file, then the type of file it is\u2014so \u201copen family letter document,\u201d for example. If you\u2019re not precise enough with the name of the file, you\u2019ll see a list of options.\n\nFind pictures and videos\n\nYour chromebook has a display, obviously, so any kind of query that relies on visual feedback is a good one to try: Ask to see pictures or videos on a particular topic, for example, and they\u2019ll pop up as thumbnails. You can even drag images right from the results into a Google Doc or a blank tab.\n\nIn the case of videos, if Google Assistant thinks it has a specific match for your query, it\u2019ll open up the video in YouTube rather than displaying a gallery of search results. You can also search through your Google Photos too: Just start your request off with \u201cmy photos of...\u201d.\n\nScreenshot: Gizmodo\n\nPlay music on your chromebook\n\nUse your chromebook as a jukebox \u2014 you can tell Google Assistant to play any type of music (like \u201cparty\u201d or \u201cchill out\u201d), or any specific artist, album, or song, and it will oblige. By default, you\u2019ll get a YouTube video or a YouTube video mix, so visuals are included too.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Spotify user, add \u201con Spotify\u201d to the end of your query, and the Spotify web player opens up instead of YouTube. That\u2019s pretty much your lot as far as music services go though \u2014 YouTube Music isn\u2019t integrated on chromebooks yet.\n\nChange settings on your chromebook\n\nGoogle Assistant ties in tightly with Chrome OS as a whole: You can use the Assistant to turn Wi-Fi on and off, turn Bluetooth on and off, and to adjust the display brightness and system volume.\n\nYou\u2019ll find there are quite a few Google Assistant shortcuts you can use instead of navigating through the usual Settings tab \u2014 try \u201cclear browsing history\u201d or \u201cchange time zone,\u201d for example. If you type in or say \u201chow much battery is left,\u201d it will return the battery level percentage.\n\n...and everything else\n\nOf course, the number of ways you can interact with Google Assistant is virtually limitless, so we can\u2019t mention everything here. Any kind of web query, or calculation, or conversion will work with Google Assistant. You can get it to tell you the weather forecast, the latest news, or sports scores.\n\nYou can use Google Assistant on chromebooks to set alarms and timers, which stay local to your device. Another option is to create reminders, which are different in that they sync across all of the devices you\u2019re logged into with your Google account, and they appear on your Google Calendar too.\n\nSmart home devices that you\u2019ve added in the Google Home app for Android or iOS can be controlled via Google Assistant on a chromebook \u2014 you can set the temperature of a smart thermostat or turn smart lights on or off just as you would with a Google Home speaker, for instance. You can\u2019t yet bring up security camera footage on your chromebook, though.\n\nIf you like, you can use Google Assistant to browse to specific websites on your chromebook, though obviously, some URLs are easier to say than others. If you tell Google Assistant to open up an app like Instagram or the Play Store, it\u2019ll work \u2014 but you\u2019ll get sent to the online web version in your browser, not the standalone app.", "description": "Google Assistant is spreading into more and more devices \u2014 you might be familiar with it from your smartphone, or your smart speaker, or your smart display, but it\u2019s also arriving on more and more chromebooks, too....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/jmnyu7we4ztgervyc1gj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
