For federal employees, therefore, the biggest concern was usually whether they had enough cash in the bank to make their next payments before the government reopened, a situation made more difficult by prolonged shutdowns such as the one that began in December of last year.\n\nIn mandating back pay for employees in all future shutdowns, Congress took a step to ease the anxiety of federal workers.\n\nBut in recent years, many low-wage jobs once filled by federal employees have been contracted out to firms that provide regular cleaners, security guards and food workers in the government\u2019s buildings.\n\nThose contractors have been left on the hook.\n\n\"A month without pay really sets you back. I\u2019m still paying off emergency room visits for both myself and my daughter,\" said Michelle Serrano, a federally contracted security officer at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian, at a recent union event on the subject.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been worried about another shutdown. The uncertainty keeps me up at night,\" Serrano said.\n\nThe dysfunction in the appropriations process for the 2020 fiscal year, which began Tuesday, inspires little confidence.\n\nWhile the House passed 10 of 12 annual appropriations bills along party lines, the consensus-driven Senate has failed to pass a single one. Last week, Trump signed an eight-week stopgap measure to keep the lights on through Nov. 21.\n\nThe central issue in negotiations remains Trump\u2019s proposed border wall and his use of an emergency declaration to reprogram defense and Treasury funds toward building it.\n\nSenate negotiators are working furiously to find a solution, but Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbyTrump signs stopgap measure, funding government through November On The Money: Trump signs stopgap spending bill | Shutdown fight delayed to November | Deutsche Bank reveals it has two individual tax returns tied to House subpoena | House Dems demand documents on Ukraine aid The Hill's 12:30 Report: Pelosi attacks Barr over Ukraine call MORE (R-Ala.) has lamented that the deadlock could lead to a yearlong stopgap. House Democrats, meanwhile, have insisted that they will not pass noncontroversial spending bills unless there is agreement on all the spending bills, further delaying progress.\n\nAs funding talks drag on, Democrats are pushing for a back pay measure.\n\nHouse Democrats included a bill called the Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Federal Contractor Employees Act, sponsored by Rep.

Union groups hope that passing a one-time back pay bill will leave the door open for a more permanent solution.\n\nIronically, controversy over the House\u2019s spending plan, the very vehicle that would advance contractor back pay, could lead to another shutdown.\n\n\"Most people could not survive without 35 days of income,\" said Serrano. \"Why are contracted workers expected to?\"", "description": "With another potential government shutdown looming next month, activist groups are pushing for legislation to protect low-wage federal contractors, a group they say can least afford to lose income but has the fewest protections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/dome_shutdown_012218gn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
