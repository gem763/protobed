Rugby World Cup 2019 A Wales supporters laughs outside the City of Toyota Stadium AFP/Getty Images\n\nCoach John McKee opted to field just three players from Fiji's opening game against the Wallabies but there was little hint of the drama to come when hooker Mesulame Dolokoto opened the scoring with an eighth-minute try.\n\nA breakaway score from scrum-half Santiago Arata in the 13th minute shook the Pacific Islanders but loosehead prop Eroni Mawi restored their lead when he forced his way over for his first Test try and Josh Matavesi's conversion made it 12-7.\n\nHowever, Fiji continued to come up with errors and were punished in ruthless fashion by their enthusiastic and energetic opponents.\n\nMidway through the first half number eight Manuel Diana rumbled over for a try from a line-out and four minutes later centre Juan Manuel Cat finished off a sweetly-worked move among the outside backs.\n\nFelipe Berchesi kicked his third conversion and added a penalty three minutes before half-time to stretch the South Americans' lead to 24-12.\n\nFiji led 21-12 against Australia only to lose 39-21, conceding 27 unanswered points, and had high hopes of turning the tables in similar fashion in the second half.\n\nBut the wayward Matavesi was wide with a penalty early in the second half and, although second row Api Ratuniyarawa burst through for a try, to give them renewed hope, Uruguay grew stronger.\n\nA Berchesi penalty took their lead to 27-17 to equal their previous highest World Cup score and edge them closer to the unthinkable.\n\nReplacement Nikola Matawalu peeled off a ruck to pull a try back after 66 minutes but Ben Volavola, who took over the goalkicking duties, missed the conversion to leave his side still trailing by five points.\n\nAnother Berchesi penalty kept the scoreboard ticking over for the underdogs and, although Matawalu went over for his second try in injury time to secure a losing bonus point, it was scant consolation.", "description":
