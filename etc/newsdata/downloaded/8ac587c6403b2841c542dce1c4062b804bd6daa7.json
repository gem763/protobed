It has struck 50 countries, killing hundreds of millions of pigs while reshaping global meat and feed markets.\n\nMore:\n\nPhilippines confirms African swine fever, culls 7,000 pigs\n\nSwine fever in China poses big risk to food markets, report says\n\nIs swine fever creating a market for Colombian meat in China?\n\n\"We are really facing a threat that is global,\" OIE Director General Monique Eloit told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\"The risk exists for all countries, whether they are geographically close or geographically distant because there is a multitude of potential sources of contamination.\"\n\nAfrican swine fever, which is not harmful to humans, can be transmitted by a tourist bringing back a ham or sausage sandwich from a contaminated country and throwing it away - only to have that tainted garbage be reused by farmers to feed their pigs, Eloit said.\n\nThere are additional risks from trading live animals and food products across borders and from small breeders using restaurant or train-station waste to feed their stock.\n\nThe disease has spread rapidly to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Korea, and the Philippines, and more countries are likely to be hit in the coming months.\n\n\"In the short term, we are not going towards an improvement. We will continue to have more outbreaks in the infected countries. Neighbouring countries are at high risk, and for some, the question is when they will be infected,\" Eloit said, stressing that controls were difficult to implement.\n\nThe spread of African swine fever has not only ravaged the Asian pig population, but also sent international pork prices rocketing and hit animal feed markets such as corn and soya beans.\n\nIt has also weighed on the results of agricultural commodity groups due to weaker feed demand for hog breeding.\n\nChina's hog herd was more than 40 percent smaller in September than a year earlier, its farm ministry said earlier this month. But several in the industry believe the losses are much greater.\n\nBeijing issued a series of policies in September aimed at supporting national hog production and securing meat supplies.\n\nEloit said the measures were adequate, but needed to be fully implemented.\n\n\"There is a difference between what is decided on paper - I do not think there is any concern here - and how we actually get to apply [decisions] on the ground especially in countries that are very large, which have a wide variety of production,\" she said\n\nIn Europe, the situation is different because outbreaks mainly concern wild boars, Eloit added.\n\nAfrican swine fever has been found on farms in Eastern Europe, but its spread had been mostly contained, due mainly to tight security measures implemented in some countries.", "description": "World Organisation for Animal Health says no country is immune from being hit by the deadly animal virus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/aaf3e1d7582b462faca8fdd43b067b1e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
