And now we\u2019re getting out,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at a White House press conference. \u201cLet someone else fight over this long bloodstained sand.\u201d\n\nLacing his victory speech with caveats, Trump said Turkey has enacted a permanent ceasefire against Kurds in Syria, though he acknowledged that promise was \u201csomewhat questionable\u201d given Turkey's history of attacking the population. He also said that the U.S. will lift all sanctions against Turkey \u201dunless something happens we\u2019re not happy with.\u201d\n\nAfter a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Trump announced early this month that the U.S. would remove forces from northeast Syria; days later, the Pentagon said it would remove roughly 1,000 troops from the country.\n\nMembers of both political parties swiftly condemned the plan, which they said would threaten the lives of Kurds as well as damage U.S. clout in the region. House Democrats and Republicans condemned the decision in a bipartisan rebuke.\n\nNBC News reported that the decision \u201cblindsided\u201d senior White House, Pentagon, and State Department officials, as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill and U.S. allies abroad.\n\nShortly after U.S. troops began leaving the country, Turkish forces invaded Kurdish territory. Kurds roundly declared that the U.S., which has long protected them with a military presence in the area, betrayed them. Some threw potatoes and other produce at U.S. troops as they retreated to Iraq.\n\nREAD: Turkey and Russia are teaming up to screw over the Kurds\n\nUnder attack from Turkey, Kurds also struggled to keep members of ISIS in prison. (Trump said on Wednesday that \u201cISIS is under very very strict lock and key, and detention facilities are being strongly maintained,\u201d though he added that some ISIS fighters escaped.)\n\nTurkey previously announced a brief ceasefire against Kurds in Syria, though Kurdish leaders said that the country violated that agreement.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, shortly before Trump spoke in the White House, news broke that the presidents of Turkey and Russia had reached a new agreement about the policy: It stipulates that if Kurdish forces don\u2019t cede part of their territory, Turkey will continue its attack against them.\n\nBut in his speech at the White House, Trump claimed that the U.S. actually prevented Kurds from being killed, and argued that the U.S. has no business being engaged in conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nThe comments echo criticisms of the Obama administration that Trump made while he was campaigning for president in 2016: that the U.S. should not act as the police force of the world, or expend resources protecting countries that don\u2019t financially benefit the U.S.\n\n\u201cNow Turkey, Syria, and others in the region must work to ensure that ISIS does not regain any territory. It\u2019s their neighborhood. They have to maintain it, they have to take care of it,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to me to be congratulated,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut we\u2019ve done a good job. We\u2019ve saved a lot of lives.\u201d\n\nCover: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about Syria in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House in Washington, DC, October 23, 2019.
