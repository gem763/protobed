But given consensus EBITDA for the 2020 financial year will still be around $160 million (up from $126 million in 2019) the hit isn\u2019t too brutal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2.9 per cent fall in the Webjet share price on Monday was reasonably restrained. But with the stock now down 32 per cent in the last 12 months, the Thomas Cook collapse isn't news that investors or chief executive John Guscic really needed.\n\nThe eulogies for Thomas Cook will no doubt focus on its rich history: the founding of the business in 1841 by cabinetmaker-turned entrepreneur; the first package holiday in 1855; the creation of the forerunner of the travellers cheque in 1874; state ownership in 1948; and privatisation in 1972.\n\nBut the company\u2019s more recent history appears to be the story of a company trying to grow its way to survival.\n\nSix years after being acquired by German travel group Condor & Neckermann, Thomas Cook merged with MyTravel Group in 2007. Four years later \u2013 after almost collapsing \u2013 Thomas Cook merged its British retail operations with that of the Co-operative Group and the Midlands Co-operative Society, creating the UK's largest chain of travel agents.\n\nThe idea that even four years ago you would be trying to build the biggest chain in any retail sector seems farcical. The idea that any CEO, banker or adviser would suggest this could work in an industry as badly disrupted as travel is extraordinary.", "description": "The collapse of iconic British travel group Thomas Cook has some fascinating links to some big names in Australian business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1981%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e0cb4c6b57762012f84dcd8ed72431de91f4ec62", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
