Rockefeller agreed to acquire Financial Clarity Inc., a Mountain View, California-based multi-family office that oversees $2.3 billion of assets, Rockefeller Capital said Wednesday. The deal is expected to be completed early in the fourth quarter. Terms weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\nFinancial Clarity founder Stan Young, 62, will join Rockefeller as a managing director and senior client adviser. He started the firm in 1992, and it \u201cexclusively serves those who shape Silicon Valley,\u201d including executives at tech giants Apple Inc. and Google, according to its website.\n\nFinancial Clarity typically caters to families and individuals with at least $30 million of assets and \u201cit is not unusual for our clients to be company founders, venture capitalists or senior corporate executives,\u201d the investment adviser said in a March regulatory filing.\n\nOver the past decade, San Francisco and Silicon Valley have churned out myriad multibillion-dollar companies, creating an ecosystem of immense wealth for their founders, executives and investors. The region is home to at least 103 billionaires today, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nRead more: Rockefeller goes Hollywood with latest hire from Bank of America\n\n\u201cThis is our first multi-family office acquisition on the West Coast,\u201d said Timothy O\u2019Hara, president of Rockefeller Global Family Office. \u201cThe opportunity to grow in Silicon Valley is accelerated just given the wealth creation in this area, which is pretty extraordinary.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to build on Financial Clarity\u2019s base of 35 longstanding family clients, adding advisers over time and helping to leverage Young\u2019s deep network in Silicon Valley, he said.\n\nFleming, 56, who has said he expects Rockefeller\u2019s assets under management to reach $36 billion by year-end, is continuing a West Coast expansion that included the opening of Los Angeles and San Francisco wealth-management offices earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to look throughout the money centers as you think about the U.S., and areas where it could make sense for us to have offices,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. Southern California could be a possibility, he said, as well as Seattle. Rockefeller Global Family Office also is looking to expand a small office in Palm Beach, Florida, he said.\n\nRockefeller Capital, backed by hedge fund Viking Global Investors, was created in 2018 with about $18 billion under management and is an offshoot of Rockefeller & Co., once the family office of the company\u2019s namesake founder. It later evolved into a business serving wealthy families, endowments and foundations, and is owned by its management, Viking and a trust that represents the Rockefeller family.\n\n(Updates with expansion plans in penultimate paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Jack Witzig.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Suzanne Woolley in New York at swoolley2@bloomberg.net;Sophie Alexander in San Francisco at salexander82@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Peter Eichenbaum, David Scheer\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Rockefeller Capital Management, the wealth adviser led by former Morgan Stanley executive Greg Fleming, is boosting its Silicon Valley credentials.The firm that traces its roots to oil baron John D.
