Harvey said in a statement.\n\nHampton University to Offer Free Enrollment, Room & Board to University of the Bahamas Students Displaced by Hurricane Dorian: https://t.co/PMpJXH5RbX pic.twitter.com/um8BQcXRHA \u2014 Hampton University (@_HamptonU) September 5, 2019\n\nThe agreement will allow University of the Bahamas students to attend Hampton University classes this fall and receive free room and board.
