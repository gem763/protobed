In fact, the organization\u2019s most serious financial crisis erupted in the 1960s, when the Soviet Union and France both withheld dues to protest what they saw as a misguided peacekeeping operation in the Congo. But the current crisis has much more to do with the U.N.\u2019s troubled relationship with the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWho pays, and who doesn\u2019t?\n\nLike most multilateral organizations, the United Nations funds its operations through a system of annual dues. The organization uses factors including a country\u2019s economic size and wealth to assess its \u201ccapacity to pay\u201d and determine its annual bill. Very poor countries get a break, but every country pays something \u2014 the poorest nations typically owe around $30,000.\n\nFor an economic powerhouse like the United States, however, the annual bill is substantial. For 2019, the United States owes more than $600 million, 22 percent of the total U.N. regular budget. There are separate bills for peacekeeping operations, for which the United States pays an even larger percentage.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.N. accords its members 30 days from the beginning of the calendar year to pay their dues. Some countries do so immediately \u2014 leading the way this year were the Dominican Republic, Estonia and Malawi, all paid up on Jan. 1. They were followed in short order by larger contributors, including Canada and Australia.\n\nAD\n\nBut only 34 of the 193 U.N. members settled their tabs within the 30 days allotted. Almost 100 other countries, including heavyweights China, Germany and Japan, paid in full \u2014 but late. More than 60 countries still owe their dues, and these include significant contributors such as Brazil. But of the laggards, the United States is by far the most consequential.\n\nIn part because of the U.S. government fiscal cycle, Washington typically pays its U.N. bill late. But this year\u2019s tardy check is producing an unusually severe cash crunch. By the middle of the calendar year, the United Nations has typically spent down much of its cash and resorts to several reserve accounts in order to cover the bills.\n\nAD\n\nIn recent years, the organization has dipped into its reserve accounts earlier and more deeply, meaning that the fiscal cushion to cover operations is threadbare. The secretary general reported that the organization began 2019 with just $30 million in reserves, far less than in previous years.\n\nAD\n\nBut is there more to the U.S. story this year?\n\nFriction between the United States and the U.N. over money is nothing new, and U.S. legislators have often been front and center in the financial drama. Since the 1980s, lawmakers have regularly used the purse strings in an attempt to reduce the U.S. share of the U.N. budget and extract other overhauls.\n\nIn an environment of sometimes intense congressional skepticism, U.S. administrations have sometimes found themselves mediating between legislators and the United Nations. In the 1990s, Ambassador Richard Holbrooke patched together a compromise with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to reduce America\u2019s dues in exchange for U.S. payment of almost $900 million in accumulated arrears.\n\nAD\n\nFast forward to 2019, and President Trump\u2019s core conviction that the United States bears unfair burdens on the international stage \u2014 it\u2019s logical to see the current crisis as one more battle in Trump\u2019s war to get the United States a better deal. In a 2017 meeting with the U.N. secretary general, Trump insisted that \u201cno member state [should] shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden.\u201d And in a tweet last week, Trump suggested that restoring the U.N. to financial health was the rest of the world\u2019s responsibility.\n\nAD\n\nSo make all Member Countries pay, not just the United States! https://t.co/IVbE4MqBVl \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nBut the president\u2019s tweets do not appear to reflect any coherent policy. The current delay in payment isn\u2019t part of a coordinated U.S. policy of forcing a change in U.N. assessments. The U.N. does not revisit assessments until 2021, in any case.\n\nBrett Schaefer, a Heritage Foundation expert and member of the U.N.\u2019s Committee on Contributions, told me that complications resulting from the long-standing U.S. practice of paying its U.N. dues toward the end of the calendar year have been exacerbated by broader legislative and bureaucratic issues. According to Schaefer, Congress\u2019s failure to pass a full budget resolution and the State Department\u2019s delay in issuing several congressionally mandated certifications have reduced funds available for payment.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.N. is carefully navigating choppy financial waters\n\nAD\n\nAs it waits for Washington\u2019s check, the U.N. leadership is ginning up support among U.N. members for steps to mitigate future financial stress. One solution might be to more effectively threaten consequences for nonpayment. Article 19 of the U.N. Charter provides that a country can lose its vote in the General Assembly \u2014 although not its vote in the more powerful Security Council \u2014 if its accumulated debt exceeds two annual payments. The secretary general has asked member states to consider lowering that debt threshold, so that losing the vote is a more credible threat.\n\nOther proposed solutions include replenishing and expanding the U.N.\u2019s reserve accounts and instituting more flexible budgeting procedures that will allow the U.N. to shift money between different accounts. These measures could all help at the margins.\n\nAD\n\nBut the multilateral organization\u2019s fraught relationship with its largest contributor all but ensures future financial instability. And whatever the Trump administration\u2019s precise calculation, America\u2019s failure to pay poses an immediate challenge for Kelly Knight Craft, the newly installed U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nDavid Bosco is an associate professor at Indiana University\u2019s Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies.
