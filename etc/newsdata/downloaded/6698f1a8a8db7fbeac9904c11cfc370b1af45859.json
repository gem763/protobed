These upfront costs can require thousands of dollars during a time when more than 40% of the U.S. population has under $400 in savings, according to Rhino. Jain said the move would bolster the economy more than the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act.\n\nOffering renters a choice and insurance services like Rhino\u2019s, which charges as little as $3 per month for insurance that covers landlord risks, like damage and non-payment, in lieu of a cash security deposit would help people afford housing, he said.\n\nLarge housing landlords, like UDR, Inc. (UDR) and Greystar Real Estate Partners, already allow tenants to opt for security deposit alternatives. Over the past year, insurance has saved renters in New York City over $60 million, according to Rhino, which estimates that renters could save more than $200 million if such a policy was implemented nationally.\n\nRhino also calls for allowing renters to transfer security deposits between rentals when relocating, according to the proposal.\n\nLandlords \u2018don\u2019t make any money on security deposits\u2019\n\nRhino said offering renters alternatives to security deposits benefits landlords, too, as a lower barrier to entry attracts renters and lowers vacancy rates in buildings.\n\n\u201cLandlords use [Rhino] because they don\u2019t make any money on security deposits, but it\u2019s become a huge barrier,\u201d said Jain, who is also the CEO of Kairos, a private venture capital fund that focuses on affordability solutions.\n\nJain proposed that politicians back a national bill that would be favored by young voters, who would have better access to the rental market because such a a law would waive upfront costs. Whether Rhino\u2019s proposal will ever be adopted on a national level is unknown, but the startup, which recently completed an initial $21 million round of funding, is collaborating with members of Congress in a national push for legislation and local politicians in New York City, Richmond, Philadelphia, and Miami Lakes to target local markets, according to Jason Novak, a Rhino representative. Last year, Rhino partnered with New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer to propose legislation in the Big Apple.\n\nRhino is not the first company to try to disrupt the rental security deposit system. Rentberry, a California-based company that aims to streamline the leasing process, seeks micro-lenders to cover 90% of a security deposit, which the renter repays over time, according to the company\u2019s blog.\n\nSome cities like Seattle, Washington and New York also allow renters to pay installments. But Rhino argues that installment payments do not provide the same protection for landlords that insurance or a traditional security deposit would offer.\n\nCorrection: Kairos was misidentified in an earlier version of this article.\n\nSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "A New York City-based startup wants U.S. legislators to require landlords to accept insurance instead of security deposits.", "authors": ["Sarah Paynter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X.WkEmDWN.iLW9BTDnn5Gg--~B/aD0zNjY3O3c9NTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c686ca20-e51f-11e9-bdbf-c008a85e9a59", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
