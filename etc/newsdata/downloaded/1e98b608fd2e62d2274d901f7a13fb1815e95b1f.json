The downgrade reflects DMDT's announcement that it was unable pay the semi-annual interest payment on the USD300 million 8.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024. Key Rating Drivers Missed Coupon; Grace Period: The rating downgrade follows DMDT's announcement that it was unable to pay the semi-annual coupon of around USD13 million on its USD300 million 8.625% notes that was due on 12 September 2019. The company has entered into a 30-day grace period following the non-payment event. Severe Liquidity Issues: We do not expect DMDT to be able to cure the default within the grace period as it is facing a severe liquidity crunch. We believe DMDT's last reported cash of around IDR700 billion (around USD50 million) as of 30 March 2019 is no longer available to meet the company's obligations after its explanation of a cash drain due to slow sales, stretched working capital and settlement of deeply out-of-the-money forward contracts. Financial Presentation Postponed: The company was due to present its financial position to existing bank lenders and noteholders today. However, it opted to defer the presentation following reports that a supplier had filed a petition for a court-enforced suspension of creditor liabilities (PKPU) against DMDT and associated companies in the Duniatex group, its parent, in the Semarang Commercial Court in Indonesia. The company stated that it has not received an official notice from any court regarding a petition for a PKPU against the company. Any debt restructuring that involves a material reduction in terms for the existing noteholders would be considered a distressed debt exchange (DDE) under Fitch's relevant criteria. The completion of a debt restructuring that would be treated as a DDE or failure to cure the payment default in 30 days would lead to a downgrade to 'RD' (restricted default).Recovery Rating of 'RR4': Fitch uses a going-concern value approach to calculate DMDT's post-restructuring enterprise value, given its nature as a manufacturing-based company. We estimate going-concern EBITDA of around IDR1.4 trillion, equal to our estimate of the level necessary to service the company's post-restructuring debt obligations, maintenance capex and working-capital requirements. We assume an EBITDA multiple of 4x and a deduction of 10% for administrative claims. These assumptions result in a recovery rate for the bonds within the 'RR3' range. However, the recovery rate is subject to a soft cap of 'RR4', which maps to a senior unsecured rating of 'C' in line with our Corporates Notching and Recovery Ratings Criteria. Derivation Summary DMDT's rating of 'C' follows the missed coupon on 12 September 2019 and the start of the company's 30-day grace period. Key Assumptions Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer- Significant deterioration in net sales and profit margin in 2019 (2018 EBITDA margin: 21%)- No dividends for the next two yearsKey Recovery Rating Assumptions- Fitch believes DMDT would be considered a going concern in a bankruptcy and would be reorganised rather than liquidated because of its nature as a manufacturing-based company- We have assumed going-concern EBITDA of around IDR1.4 trillion, equal to our estimate of the level of EBITDA necessary to service the company's post-restructuring debt obligations, maintenance capex and working-capital requirements- An enterprise value (EV) multiple of 4x is used to calculate a post-reorganisation EV. Fitch believes this is closer to a distressed multiple, considering that other Indonesia-based textile and garment manufacturers - PT Sri Rejeki Isman Tbk (BB-/Stable) and PT Pan Brothers Tbk (B/Stable) - are trading at around 5x and 10x EV/EBITDA multiples, respectively- Around IDR1.5 trillion of secured debt as of 31 March 2019 has priority over the senior unsecured US dollar bond. On the other hand, we have assumed the forward contracts' settlement obligations will rank pari passu with the senior unsecured bond.- 10% administrative claim to be applied on the going-concern EV- These assumptions result in a recovery rate for senior unsecured notes within the 'RR3' range. However, because Indonesia falls into Group D of creditor friendliness under our Country-Specific Treatment of Recovery Ratings Criteria, the recovery rate is subject to a soft cap of 'RR4', which maps to a senior unsecured rating of 'C' in line with our Corporates Notching and Recovery Ratings Criteria RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action- A positive rating action is unlikely. However, Fitch may take positive rating action if there is an improvement in DMDT's liquidity positionDevelopments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action- The IDR will be downgraded to 'RD' after the expiry of the grace period or completion of a DDE- The IDR will be downgraded to 'D' if DMDT enters into bankruptcy proceedings, administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up procedure or if it ceases operations Liquidity and Debt Structure Extremely Poor Liquidity: Fitch believes DMDT does not have the funds to cure the defaulted bond interest and the company's access to new capital is also poor. Summary of Financial Adjustments - Fitch includes advance payments, which are mostly for raw materials, as part of the working-capital calculation- Shareholder loans are not treated as debt ESG Considerations We have scored DMDT's governance sub-factors on governance structure at '5' and its financial transparency score at '4'. DMDT's governance structure was scored at '5' to reflect our view of Duniatex group's weak corporate governance, financial discipline and operational execution, which have a negative impact on the company's credit profile and is highly relevant to the rating. We gave a financial transparency score of '4' because - in combination with the other factors - the relative lack of reliable timely information affected the rating.
