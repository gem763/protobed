Online, the Mississauga, Ont., native has been crowned with the hashtag #SheTheNorth, parallelling the one Torontonians tweeted all the way to the Toronto Raptors' 2019 NBA Finals win.\n\nThe Raptors weren't shy about using the hashtag either:\n\nSHE THE CHAMP! <br><br>Congrats, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bandreescu_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Bandreescu_</a> \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeTheNorth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WeTheNorth</a> x <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SheTheNorth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SheTheNorth</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QEugBwH24W\">pic.twitter.com/QEugBwH24W</a> \u2014@Raptors\n\nOn Saturday, Andreescu became the first Canadian to win a Grand Slam singles title, beating Serena Williams 6-3, 7-5 in the U.S. Open women's final in New York.\n\nAnd that a kid from Toronto could defeat one of tennis's undisputed legends, Serena Williams, is inspiring even the youngest tennis enthusiasts to reach for greatness too.\n\nSara Bosch, 10, is one of them.\n\n\"I find that she always perseveres and never stops,\" Bosch said at a tennis tournament in Toronto ahead of her hometown idol's historic match. \"It makes me feel like maybe one day I can be as good as her.\"\n\nAref Jallali coached Andreescu from ages 11-13, ahead of the Les petits As - one of the most prestigious youth tennis tournaments. (Michael Charles Cole/CBC)\n\nAs of Saturday, Nikita Reuter, 8, hadn't decided whether Andreescu or Williams was her favourite.\n\nBut knowing that someone from so close to home could soar to the heights of tennis, Reuter said, \"I feel like I can make it past anything.\"\n\nThe significance of the moment wasn't lost on 13-year-old Jenson Bicanic, either.\n\n\"It's been 40 years since a Canadian has been in the finals of a U.S. Open, so that's pretty big.\"\n\n'It's like me playing in the finals'\n\nBicanic had the chance to be the ballboy for Andreescu at the Rogers Cup.\n\n\"She was very kind ... very active and fun, full of joy,\" he said, recalling meeting her before match.\n\nSara Bosch, 10, says Andreescu is an inspiration to her. (Michael Charles Cole/CBC)\n\nBut on the court, it's all strategy, he said.\n\n\"I like how aggressive she is,\" said Bicanic. \"She always moves around the other player.\"\n\nTennis coach Rachel Gould says she can see Andreescu's inspiration firing up young players and says the star is making a real impact in terms of growing the sport in Canada.\n\n\"I think overall there's more players coming out and playing even, with parents, especially more and more females. I'd say more girls playing this year I think as well,\" she said.\n\nGould hopes to see that interest extend past this season.\n\nThe significance of the moment wasn't lost on 13-year-old Jenson Bicanic, who had a chance to be the ballboy for Andreescu. (Michael Charles Cole/CBC)\n\nBesides, you never know where the next Andreescu might be playing.\n\n\"It's like me playing in the finals of the U.S. Open in like five years,\" said Bicanic.\n\n\"It inspires me a lot.\"", "description": "Long before she ever became a household name, Bianca Andreescu had her sights set on greatness\u00a0\u2014 quite literally, with the words \"I won\" written on her hand before taking to the court.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5274967.1567890892!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bianca-andreescu.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
