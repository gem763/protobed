You talk about your life and what you want for the country and for the end of this presidency. Do you wanted to come sooner than later?\n\nJAMES COMEY: Change in the administration? I am optimistic that even if there is not in impeachment proceeding and a removal from office, the American people are going to pass judgment on what kind of country we want to be. We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there\u2019s diversity on policy here. I don\u2019t care what your views are. I hope you articulate and defend and listen and debate them \u2014 That\u2019s important. But we have something in common and I said it with the first question you asked. We have a set of values at the core of this country that hold this place together. I tried to explain to kids something that most of you know, we shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the normal human glue that holds a country together. We don\u2019t have a common ancestry, common language, common faith. We have nothing in common except a set of values. That is the glue in the United States that holds Republicans, Democrats, and independents together. And I think the American people are alert to the threat that is above our policy disagreements, which are important. Guns are an incredibly important issue. Immigration, abortion, taxes are really important. Above that is something we have in common that\u2019s non-negotiable. Our leaders must reflect on the glue that holds us together. Their cannot be people who lie all the time. They just can\u2019t. I hope people see that is true whether they are Republicans or Democrats.\n\nWALLACE: What if [Trump] wins again? Will you still believe that?\n\nCOMEY: I will be, from my new home in New Zeland, I will still believe in America.", "description": "Fired FBI Director James Comey quipped that he will move to New Zealand if President Donald Trump wins reelection in 2020.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/James-Comey-Politicon-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
