China claims now democratic Taiwan as its sacred territory, and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing\u2019s control.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping, addressing a massive military parade in Beijing to mark seven decades of Communist Party rule, said China would promote the peaceful development of relations with Taiwan and \u201ccontinue to strive for the motherland\u2019s complete reunification\u201d.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council, responding to the parade and Xi\u2019s comments, said Taiwan would never accept \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, the model of supposedly high autonomy Hong Kong and Macau have, which Beijing sees as eventually being the best way to win Taiwan over.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has persisted with its one-party dictatorship for 70 years, a concept of governance that violates the values \u200b\u200bof democracy, freedom and human rights, causing risks and challenges for the development of mainland China,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cIts shouting about the struggle for unity, great rejuvenation and unification is only an excuse for military expansion, seriously threatening regional peace and world democracy and civilisation.\u201d\n\nTaiwan has been democratic for more than 30 years, and China should use this moment to reflect and push for democracy, it added.\n\n\u201cThe lifeline of the survival and development of mainland China is not tied to one person and one party,\u201d the council said.\n\nTaiwan will not be bullied into accepting China\u2019s position, it added.\n\nChina has heaped pressure on Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who faces re-election in January, believing she wishes to push for the island\u2019s formal independence, a red line for Beijing.\n\nChina has also been angered for expressions of support from Taiwan for anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which are expected again on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are a country of democracy and freedom and will show support for anyone in the world who pursues democracy and freedom,\u201d Tsai told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cLikewise, any ruler should carefully listen to the people\u2019s pursuit of freedom and democracy and respect the people\u2019s will.\u201d", "description": "Taiwan's government on Tuesday condemned China's \"dictatorship\" on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, saying the country was a threat to peace and trying to find excuses for its military expansion.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435767775&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901YQ", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
