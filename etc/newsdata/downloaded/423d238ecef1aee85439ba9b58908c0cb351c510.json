Biden Jr.\n\nThe rising furor has heightened interest in how the impeachment process works.

Richard M. Nixon, resigned in 1974 to avoid being impeached.\n\nWhat is a \u201chigh crime\u201d?\n\nThe term \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d came out of the British common law tradition: it was the sort of offense that Parliament cited in removing crown officials for centuries. Essentially, it means an abuse of power by a high-level public official.
