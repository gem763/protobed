So, Oxford students have voted to ban it. From the Metro story:\n\nStudents at the University of Oxford have voted to \u2018replace clapping\u2019 with a silent wave because it \u2018could trigger anxiety\u2019. They are instead being told to use \u2018jazz hands\u2019, where they wave their hands in the air.\n\nThe motion to \u2018mandate the encouragement of silent clapping\u2019 was successfully passed by the university\u2019s student union officers, following their first meeting of the year on Tuesday. It will come apply at student union events, and if successful, rolled out to other societies and events.\n\nOxford students had argued that alternatives to clapping already existed in some organisations and institutions and that they should follow suit. It comes after the University of Manchester passed a similar motion in September last year.", "description": "Apparently some people are made anxious by applause.
