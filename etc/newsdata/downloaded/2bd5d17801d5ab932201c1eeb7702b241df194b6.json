(Sept. 23) AP Entertainment\n\nSometimes things in life go so bad that you just block them from your memory \u2013 like auditioning for \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nElizabeth Olsen stopped by \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" on Thursday and told the hosts she auditioned for the role of Khaleesi and forgot she even tried out for the role because the experience just went so terribly.\n\n\"I also forgot that I auditioned for it,\" the \"Avengers\" star said. \"Someone had asked about a terrible audition experience \u2013 a journalist, not a good time to remember something like that, and I was like, \u2018I actually really love auditioning; I can\u2019t really think of anything, and I was like, 'Oh! Right! I auditioned for \"Game of Thrones.'\"\n\nOlsen shared she was reading with the casting director because no one else was available, and she was auditioning the scene where Khaleesi gets burned alive.\n\nElizabeth Olsen says she auditioned for Khaleesi, but it went horribly.

It was that bad,\" Olsen said.\n\nKelly Ripa asked the actress if she knows when an audition is going bad.\n\n\"It was horrible,\" Olsen explained. \"This is uncomfortable for me. I'm sure it's awkward for her, like no one's going to enjoy this experience.\"\n\nOlsen said now she would just tell the casting director if she was having a rough audition rather than going through the whole process. She also noted that even when she gets offered roles, she still asks to audition just to feel out the \"vibe.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/11/game-thrones-avengers-elizabeth-olsen-forgot-awful-audition/3941801002/", "description": "Elizabeth Olsen said she auditioned for Khaleesi from \"Game of the Thrones\" and the experience was so bad that she forgot she even did it.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
