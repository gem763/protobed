According to a report from Politico, Trump has become obsessed with the junk science of polygraphs to help plug up the historic leak problem in his administration. Following major disclosures, the president has consistently brought up lie-detector tests as a way to determine which staffers have disclosed information to reporters.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to polygraph every employee in the building to unearth who it was who spoke to the press,\u201d one former official told Politico. To appease the president, White House staffers have offered to take polygraphs to prove they weren\u2019t the source of the leak. Of course, even if they did sit for a lie-detector test, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily prove much: The procedure, which determines autonomic changes in heart rate, respiration, and skin conductivity, is notoriously unreliable.\n\nSince the late 1990s, psychologists have determined that it may be impossible for the test to produce an accurate result, due to the variability of human response under stress. As the American Psychological Association notes, \u201cAn honest person may be nervous when answering truthfully and a dishonest person may be non-anxious.\u201d Because of their iffy results, 27 states do not allow the tests to be admissible at trial. (Still, they are relied upon in the intelligence community. \u201cPolygraphs are \u201cpart of \u2018Leak Investigation 101\u2019 and should absolutely be used when necessary to protect against the unlawful release of national security information,\u201d a former NSC official told Politico.)\n\nThough the president wouldn\u2019t let something like the accuracy of a test \u2014 or a major invasion of his staffers\u2019 privacy \u2014 get in his way, the usual roadblock for Trump\u2019s bad ideas won out, as administration members just ignored his requests. The polygraphs were \u201csomething that was discussed and people were trying to placate the president and trying to show that they were taking it as personally and just as seriously as he was,\u201d a former White House official told Politico. \u201cTaking that line of, \u2018Oh yeah, we have to polygraph people\u2019 was a way to ingratiate themselves with him, but it wasn\u2019t an idea that ever went anywhere because it was absurd.\u201d\n\nPolitico also reports that Trump \u201chas been upset about how certain call transcripts, draft executive orders and other palace intrigue stories have made their way to the media.\u201d It\u2019s a presidential anxiety that may have added to the impeachment crisis: To hide such embarrassing call transcripts, Trump has been dumping them in a top-secret server designed for classified national security information, a detail that the Ukraine whistle-blower revealed in September.", "description": "According to a report from Politico, Donald Trump has become obsessed with the junk science of polygraphs to help plug up the historic leak problem in his administration.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/08/08-donald-trump-polygraph.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
