Graham said in reaction to Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s promise to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they do not recognize homosexual marriage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stand with the Word of God, the Holy Bible, which is truth from cover to cover,\u201d Graham added in a three-part tweet Friday evening.\n\nRev. Graham, the son of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Pastor,\u201d Billy Graham, was reacting to CNN\u2019s \u201cEquality in America\u201d town hall meeting held on Thursday, which focused on LGBTQ issues with 2020 presidential candidates of the Democrat party.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke \u201csaid churches, religious organizations, universities that don\u2019t go along w/ same-sex marriage should lose their tax-exempt status,\u201d Graham noted. \u201cThis gives you a clue of what the progressive, socialist-leaning Dem. Party would try to force on our nation if they win any election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will create laws & \u2018consequences\u2019 that would punish those who don\u2019t agree w/ them. This is a threat to religious freedom & free speech,\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, Rev. Graham came out against South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg for his efforts to defend abortion and homosexuality as Christian positions.\n\n\u201cMayor Pete Buttigieg has been speaking openly about his support for abortion, which he says is a woman\u2019s right to choose. That\u2019s a crock \u2014 No one has the right to choose murder,\u201d Rev. Graham wrote to his eight million Facebook followers in response to a Townhall article on Buttigieg\u2019s efforts to redefine Christian morality.\n\nDuring an interview with The Breakfast Club, Mayor Pete said the Bible is ambiguous about when life begins, and, thus, Christianity allows for a range of positions on abortion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of parts of the Bible which talk about how life begins with breath,\u201d the Democrat presidential hopeful said. \u201cAnd even so, that\u2019s something that we can interpret differently.\u201d\n\nMayor Pete has also insisted that Christianity has no problem with same-sex marriage, despite the numerous biblical passages that condemn homosexuality as an abomination before God and the unbroken Christian tradition that treats homosexual practice as gravely sinful.\n\n\u201cMayor Pete is trying to tell people that the homosexual lifestyle is okay with God and that abortion is okay,\u201d Graham wrote on Facebook. \u201cHis brother-in-law is right when he said, \u2018This is leading people astray and it\u2019s very, very dangerous.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cGod defines right and wrong, not us,\u201d Graham concludes. \u201cAs Christians, we are to live by the standards He gives us in His Word. \u2018I am the Lord, and there is no other; there is no God besides Me.\u2019 (Isaiah 45:5).\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Celebrated evangelist Franklin Graham has criticized the Democrats\u2019 LGBT agenda push, saying he will stand with biblical morality.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
