\u201cI have looked carefully at all the arguments that have been made and assessed all of the materials.\n\n\u201cI have also examined the complaint itself. It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and difficult judgements.\n\n\u201cBut, in this instance, I don\u2019t think Naga\u2019s words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made.\n\n\u201cThere was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear.\n\n\u201cShe is an exceptional journalist and presenter and I am proud that she works for the BBC.\u201d\n\nThe BBC ruled Ms Munchetty had crossed an editorial line when in a July breakfast broadcast she commented on the statements directed by Mr Trump towards politicians Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley.\n\nMs Munchetty told co-presenter Dan Walker: \u201cEvery time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
