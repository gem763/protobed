They\u2019ll turn to their de facto ace, Shane Bieber, in a crucial spot for division and wild card ramifications. Bieber has been sensational through the second half of this season, racking up 10 straight quality starts with 37 or more FanDuel points in each of those. He has recorded 20 strikeouts through 13.1 innings in his last two starts against the Twins, and I\u2019m thinking the Minnesota bats will continue to be perplexed by his stuff.\n\nAlso Consider: Max Fried, Jose Berrios\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nAnthony Rizzo - Chicago Cubs (vs. Pittsburgh)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Rockies-Padres game isn\u2019t included on this afternoon main slate, meaning Cubs-Pirates represents the highest over/under at 11.5 total runs. The wind is blowing out at 14 mph to center field in Chicago, and the ball could be flying all over the yard today. Rizzo is the leading candidate (from both teams) to make some noise within that, and I\u2019m doing my best to squeeze him into cash game lineups.\n\nAlso Consider: Freddie Freeman, Trey Mancini\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nCesar Hernandez - Philadelphia (vs. Boston)\n\nHernandez checks in with a moderate salary and sneaky-good matchup against Boston RHP Rick Porcello, who has been flailing while coughing up 12 earned runs through eight innings over his past two starts. Those struggles could persist in a road start at Philadelphia, and Hernandez is a nice bargain choice to take advantage.\n\nAlso Consider: Whit Merrifield, Ozzie Albies\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nJose Osuna - Pittsburgh (at Chicago Cubs)\n\nLet\u2019s get back to the high over/under of this Pirates-Cubs game. Osuna fits into most lineup combinations while holding a formidable blend of contact/power upside. He\u2019ll hold the platoon advantage over Cubs\u2019 LHP Jose Quintana, who has allowed eight earned runs and 12 hits through eight innings over his last two appearances. We should see plenty of runs from both sides this afternoon, and Osuna will likely hold a premium lineup spot for the Pirates.\n\nAlso consider: Josh Donaldson, Hunter Dozier\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nKevin Newman - Pittsburgh (at Chicago Cubs)\n\nNewman carries a non-imposing salary on most DFS sites despite collecting 13 hits, seven runs, and two stolen bases over his past eight games. In other words, he\u2019s an on-base machine who could rack up multiple hits, runs, and maybe even a homer in the best scoring atmosphere of this slate. The Pittsburgh leadoff man makes for an easy call when assembling cash lineups.\n\nAlso Consider: Jonathan Villar, Jean Segura\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nKyle Schwarber - Chicago Cubs (vs. Pittsburgh)\n\nHere\u2019s another easy call for you. Rizzo is my favorite pick of this game with Kris Bryant next line - although he\u2019s expensive. Schwarber\u2019s salary is more attainable (especially when spending on Bieber at SP), and he\u2019s fully capable of smacking a homer or two with the wind blowing out at Wrigley Field. It\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s my top \u201cper dollar\u201d outfielder in the player pool.\n\nKyle Tucker - Houston (at Kansas City)\n\nYou\u2019ll probably need a cheap pick or two in order to make your lineup work. If he\u2019s granted the start, Kyle Tucker of Houston makes for a strong bargain lift. The park factor in Kansas City doesn\u2019t look great, but Tucker is fresh off a 4-4 performance while stepping in against Royals\u2019 RHP Jakob Junis - who holds a .341 wOBA split to left-handed bats.\n\nAlso consider: Marcell Ozuna, Jorge Soler, Bryan Reynolds, Christin Stewart, Brett Gardner, Harold Castro, Dexter Fowler", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for the afternoon main slate on Sunday, September 15.
