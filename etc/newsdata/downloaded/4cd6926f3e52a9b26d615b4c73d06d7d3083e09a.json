Dan Petrescu, Lennon\u2019s opposite number, missed pre-match media duties after falling ill at a Glasgow hotel. The former Chelsea defender recovered sufficiently to bark instructions from the bench, even if nothing Petrescu witnessed would have raised his spirits. Celtic were the superior team in every department.\n\nYoung Boys\u2019 Christian Fassnacht jolts Rangers\u2019 hopes with late winner Read more\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cI thought we were outstanding. My only disappointment is that we didn\u2019t score more. I think there is more to come from this team.\u201d\n\nCluj\u2019s 4-3 win here in August triggered a wave of scepticism towards Lennon. Celtic responded with decent transfer business and a series of strong domestic performances. The 1-1 draw in Rennes in their opening group match was the least Celtic deserved. That Cluj saw off Lazio on the same night meant retribution would not be a straightforward process; in theory, anyway.\n\nAfter a ragged opening, Christopher Jullien twice came close to putting Celtic in front. The towering French centre-back forced Giedrius Arlauskis into a fine save with an 11th\u2011minute header, with Jullien\u2019s next attempt looping narrowly over the Cluj crossbar.\n\nThose opportunities triggered a spell of Celtic dominance which, in turn, resulted in a deserved lead. Callum McGregor\u2019s wonderful pass released Boli Bolingoli-Mbombo, whose chip from the left found the head of Odsonne Edouard. Celtic\u2019s striker further enhanced his blossoming reputation by calmly nodding the ball beyond Arlauskis.\n\nCeltic\u2019s stranglehold on the match did loosen slightly before the interval, albeit not to any material effect. Mario Rond\u00f3n had the ball in the hosts\u2019 net, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. The Cluj striker was subsequently booked for diving, having toppled under pressure from Ryan Christie inside the Celtic penalty area.\n\nGabriel Martinelli\u2019s double sends Arsenal surging past Standard Li\u00e8ge Read more\n\nIf this competition is the poor relation of the Champions League, someone has forgotten to tell the Celtic support. A packed stadium took in this fixture and the fans were back on their feet within 15 minutes of the restart.\n\nMohamed Elyounoussi showed tenacity to retrieve the ball in midfield, with the Southampton loanee feeding James Forrest. Elyounoussi\u2019s desire to maraud forward was similarly impressive; he collected Forrest\u2019s return pass before slotting home Celtic\u2019s second, albeit with the aid of a deflection.\n\n\u201cWe knew to win here again would be very hard,\u201d Petrescu said. \u201cCeltic have better players than us.\u201d", "description": "Celtic picked up their first win of the Europa League campaign with a comfortable 2-0 victory over CFR Cluj of Romania at Celtic Park", "authors": ["Ewan Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/628bfbcafe18513ee049c0e31cd106c9b39ef654/0_160_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd8c88973a9ab49fc1c1183bf83eb10b"}
