Just put Rudy on either side of the screen and let him debate himself.\u201d Then the host tried out his Giuliani impression after playing the moment when Cuomo reminded his guest that their segment was being recorded.\n\n\u201c\u2018Recorded?!\u2019\u201d Meyers said as Giuliani. \u201cI thought we were having dinner! This isn\u2019t Tavern on the Green? I\u2019ve been eating a steak this whole time!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo knowing the damage had been done,\u201d he added, \u201cRudy had to once again engage in this ritual walk of shame from the CNN studios over the Fox News studios where they played his CNN interview for him, made him watch it, and tried to get him to explain it.\u201d\n\nFinally, Meyers summed up President Trump\u2019s response to the scandal by saying, \u201cHe went from \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed\u2019 to \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2019 to \u2018we talked about Biden\u2019 to \u2018it was a perfect conversation\u2019 to \u2018If I did talk about Biden then I\u2019d have the right to talk about Biden\u2019 to \u2018I didn\u2019t pressure anyone.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but maybe you should let Rudy step in here,\u201d he joked.", "description": "\u201cSometimes I can\u2019t decide with Rudy whether he\u2019s a confused old man or if it\u2019s all an intentional strategy that he keeps fucking up because he\u2019s a confused old man.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1437,w_2554,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569293608/SM_ilr1bw", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
