Twitch\u2019s contract with Tyler as it pertained to outside brand deals was too restrictive, Blevins said. Twitch effectively was limiting Tyler\u2019s ability to grow as more than just a gaming personality on the platform, she argued. Since leaving Twitch, Tyler has scored major deals with companies like Adidas, and has a small role in Ryan Reynolds\u2019 new movie, Free Guy.\n\n\u201cWith the wording of how that contract was going, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to grow his brand much outside of gaming,\u201d Blevins told Business Insider. \u201cThere were already conflicts with his current sponsors and re-signing with that platform. And we were like, \u2018Straight up, guys, we\u2019ve worked so, so hard to grow the Ninja brand to license things and get his name out there. We can\u2019t go backwards with it.\u2019\u201d\n\nBoth Jessica and Tyler brought their concerns to Twitch over the course of several months, but the company failed to respect their wishes, she said. It all came back to contract restrictions, which Jessica described as not making sense for their growing brand by the time Tyler decided to jump to Mixer \u2014 which, as many people speculated online, did not mean a huge pay increase for Tyler.\n\n\u201cMoney was the last thing on our mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, they don\u2019t even know what went on behind the scenes and how hard we tried to make that deal work \u2014 and then how amazing Microsoft was for us.\u201d\n\nTyler has called Mixer home for a few months, and while he\u2019s boasted some impressive viewership numbers, the streaming platform still doesn\u2019t hold a candle to Twitch\u2019s dominance. New data, released by StreamElements in partnership with streaming analytics site Arsenal.gg, discovered that hours watched on Mixer jumped about 3 million (from 37.7 million to 40.2 million) the month that Tyler joined. During the same time period, Twitch jumped from 850.6 million to 932.1 million, according to StreamElements\u2019 data. Twitch\u2019s percentage of the market has grown by about 3 percent since the second quarter, too.\n\n\u201cNinja\u2019s move to Mixer turned out to not be the game changer they probably hoped when comparing their market share with Twitch\u2019s,\u201d StreamElements\u2019 CEO Doron Nir said.\n\nEven if his involvement hasn\u2019t helped Mixer tremendously, Jessica Blevins told Business Insider that Twitch had also become a toxic place for Tyler, noting that he didn\u2019t seem like himself the last few months that he was streaming on the Amazon-owned platform. She added that \u201cit really seemed like he was kind of losing himself and his love for streaming.\u201d Things are different now on Mixer \u2014 a streaming platform that has gained recognition for its stricter community guidelines pertaining to user behavior.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s back to that energetic, pumped-up Ninja,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a leap of faith, and Microsoft\u2019s been nothing but amazing to us.\u201d", "description": "Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins\u2019 surprising departure from Twitch came after months of feeling like the company didn\u2019t respect his wishes and hindered his ability to grow outside of gaming.
