After that, the EU could move speedily.\n\nGreens lawmaker Philippe Lamberts said Monday that \u201cwe could ratify next week, if not this one.\u201d\n\nHe added the Brexit deal could also spill into November, beyond the current Oct. 31 deadline for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already asked for a Brexit extension even though he is still trying to get out of the EU by the end of the month.\n\nLamberts said the EU Parliament would try to be as pragmatic as possible to avoid a situation in which Britain crashes out of the bloc with no deal.\n\n___\n\n1:10 p.m.\n\nScotland\u2019s highest court says it could censure the British government if it tries to skirt its obligation to avoid a no-deal exit from the European Union at the end of this month.\n\nBritain\u2019s Parliament has passed a law compelling the government to seek a three-month delay to Brexit if an EU divorce deal was not in place by Oct. 19 \u2014 and to accept a delay if the EU offers.\n\nThe government says Prime Minister Boris Johnson as fulfilled that obligation by sending a letter on Saturday asking for the postponement. But Johnson also sent a second letter to the EU saying he personally opposed delaying Brexit any further.\n\nJudges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh ruled Monday that the case should continue until the government\u2019s obligations under the law have been complied with \u201cin full.\u201d\n\n___\n\n11:45 a.m.\n\nThe European Commission says the fact that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not sign a letter requesting a three-month extension of the Brexit deadline has no impact on whether it is valid and that the European Union is considering the demand.\n\nWith British politicians squabbling over the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU, Johnson was forced by parliament to ask for a three-month delay to the Oct. 31 Brexit date.\n\nJohnson sent the unsigned letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk late Saturday with a second note saying that he opposes any delay.\n\nCommission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said Monday that \u201cPresident Tusk acknowledged receipt of the extension request on Saturday and, as he stated, he\u2019s now consulting with the EU 27.\u201d\n\nAndreeva says the EU has already begun ratifying the Brexit agreement it reached with Johnson last week.\n\n___\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nGermany\u2019s foreign minister says he does not want to exclude the option that there will be a \u201cshort, technical extension\u201d for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union if there are problems with ratifying the latest Brexit divorce agreement.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson grudgingly sent a letter seeking an extension of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline after Parliament slammed the brakes on his effort to push through a new divorce deal.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters in Berlin on Monday that the question of \u201cwhether there can be an extension as a whole, if there is no majority in the House of Commons, has to be looked at within the European Union and can only then be decided.\u201d\n\nMaas said Germany and the EU don\u2019t want Britain to crash out of the bloc with a no deal Brexit. He stressed that the current Brexit deal between the bloc and the U.K. about Britain\u2019s departure \u201cis balanced and fair.\u201d\n\n___\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nThe prime minister of Montenegro \u2014 a small Balkan nation that is the next in line to join the European Union \u2014 has expressed hope that once Brexit is finalized the EU\u2019s enlargement policy would regain importance.\n\nDusko Markovic tells The Associated Press that once the issue of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc is wrapped up it would \u201cfree the EU from a major problem\u201d and herald \u201cnew opportunities for candidate countries\u201d such as Montenegro. The Adriatic nation of 600,000 that is seeking EU membership after joining NATO in 2017 amid strong opposition from Russia.\n\nBut Markovic warns that the EU decision not to open membership negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania sends a negative signal to the volatile Western Balkan region, where Russia has stepped up efforts to regain historic influence.\n\n___\n\n9:10 a.m.\n\nA French official has not ruled out granting a new delay to Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc on condition that the U.K. clarifies its reasons for wanting a Brexit delay.\n\nThe deputy minister for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, told French news broadcaster BFM TV that \u201cthere is no new delay without any conditions, without justifications\u201d like a parliamentary election or a new referendum on Brexit.\n\nShe said France doesn\u2019t want the situation \u201cto last forever\u201d beyond the current Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, who had a phone call with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the weekend, called for a quick clarification of the U.K.\u2019s position. In a statement, he said a delay \u201cwould not be in any party\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\n___\n\n8:50 a.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to push for a vote on his European Union divorce deal as Parliament prepares for a week of guerrilla warfare over Brexit.\n\nJohnson plans to kick things off by asking for a \u201cstraight up-and-down vote\u201d on the EU divorce agreement on Monday, two days after lawmakers voted to delay approving the deal, according to his office.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow could refuse to allow such a vote because parliamentary rules generally bar the same measure from being considered a second time during the same session of Parliament unless something has changed.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative government will also introduce the legislation necessary to implement the Brexit agreement, opening the door to potentially lengthy debates and amendments that could scuttle the deal.\n\n___\n\n7:40 a.m.\n\nGermany\u2019s economy minister is suggesting it will be a few days before the European Union decides whether to grant a delay to Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson grudgingly sent a letter seeking an extension of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline after Parliament slammed the brakes on his effort to push through a new divorce deal.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Peter Altmaier noted on Deutschlandfunk radio Monday that Johnson\u2019s government will attempt to get a vote on the deal this week. He added \u201cwe will have somewhat more clarity in the coming days, and we will then exercise our responsibility and quickly make a decision.\u201d\n\nHe said he wouldn\u2019t have a problem with an extension by \u201ca few days or a few weeks\u201d if that rules out a no-deal Brexit.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Britain's impending departure from the European Union (all times local): 2:55 p.m. An influential Brexit expert at the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/21/06c4cc_britain-brexit-97555-flags-flutter-in-wind-houses-parliament-in-london-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
