A spokesman for Graham also said they were going to move ahead.\n\nGraham predicted his proposal would pass the Senate with enough support - a two-thirds majority - to overcome a possible veto by President Donald Trump.\n\nRepresentative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was far too soon to consider abandoning the sanctions push.\n\n\"I'm glad there's a ceasefire. It's a good sign, but let's see if it lasts and let's see what it really means,\" Engel told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nREPUBLICANS BREAK FROM TRUMP\n\nRepublicans hold a majority in the Senate. Democrats control the House.\n\nTurkey's incursion into Syria and attacks on the Kurds has marked one of the rare times when congressional Republicans have disputed a Trump policy.\n\nAnnouncing the sanctions with Graham, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn said the bill would not be the last step in Congress' effort to influence Ankara. \"Turkey could stop this right now if they wanted to,\" she said.\n\nNormally an ardent defender of fellow Republican Trump, Graham has been harshly critical of the president's decision to withdraw troops from northeastern Syria, paving the way for a Turkish offensive against Kurdish fighters who until recently were helping U.S. forces fight Islamic State (ISIS) militants.\n\n\"Congress is going to speak with a very firm, singular voice, that we will impose sanctions in the strongest measure possible against this Turkish outrage that will lead to the re-emergence of ISIS, the destruction of an ally, the Kurds and eventually benefit to Iran to the detriment of Israel,\" Graham told a news conference announcing the bill.\n\nHe also said he thought a resolution opposing the offensive in Syria, which passed the House overwhelmingly on Wednesday, would get more than 80 votes in the 100-member Senate, if the chamber's Republican leaders allowed a vote.\n\nThe measure passed the House by 354 to 60. Shortly afterward, Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi exchanged barbs as a White House meeting on Syria policy.\n\nDemocrats sought a Senate vote on the resolution on Thursday morning, but were prevented by Republican Senator Rand Paul.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said as he opened the Senate Thursday that he wanted a \"stronger\" resolution than the one passed by the House.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle, additional reporting by Richard Cowan, David Morgan and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Tom Brown)", "description": "Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers said on Thursday they would keep up their push for tougher sanctions on Turkey over its offensive in Syria despite the announcement of a five-day ceasefire.
