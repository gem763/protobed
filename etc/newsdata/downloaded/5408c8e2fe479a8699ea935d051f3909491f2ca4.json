Lighting, shadow and particle effects such as snow, dust, sparks etc. are all exemplary, class leading I\u2019d say. And colour-wise the game is much brighter and more colourful than most out there. Although I don\u2019t have a PlayStation 4, so have no idea how the best looking games on that format compare, the game is undoubtedly the best looking on Xbox in my opinion.\n\nIn fact, it made me go back and re-read your review to confirm what I thought from my original look at it \u2013 you make literally no mention of the visuals whatsoever. Firstly, I don\u2019t disagree with any of the review, the games shortcomings are evident to me as well. I just was slightly surprised that you didn\u2019t see fit to print even one sentence mentioning the graphics, or even a bullet point in the pros and cons summary. So I was just curious really to get your opinion, were you actually indifferent to the games visuals or did you just prioritise other aspects of the game you wanted to get across in the review?\n\nAlso, more in general, have you noticed Xbox One X/PS4 Pro enhanced games look noticeably better than \u2018standard\u2019 versions? I feel HDR makes a significant visual difference, both in movie/TV/YouTube material (Amazon Prime\u2019s Grand Tour is a very good example of HDR) and games, more so than simple resolution increase.\n\nAs always, keep up the good work GC.\n\ngaztop2511 (gamertag)\n\nGC: Indifferent is probably about right. The graphics are technically very impressive, but we didn\u2019t feel they were used to any interesting effect or showed anything we hadn\u2019t seen in a dozen other similar games \u2013 including the rest of the Gears Of War series. When the colour of the sand is the most interesting visual element of your game you know there\u2019s something not quite right.", "description": "The Tuesday Inbox thinks stopping kids from playing Fortnite is easy, as one reader speaks up for Ghost Recon Breakpoint.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/apps.7268.13772299482596387.fe409262-a8cf-4e28-a0ab-1c869a2644cc-5fd3_1570492971.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
