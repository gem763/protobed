Here\u2019s how it could happen.", "language": "en", "text": "Even before the recent spate of sexual misconduct allegations, murmurs among Kavanaugh opponents fixated on whether he had lied under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Saturday\u2019s story from the Times quickly raised new questions about whether Kavanaugh perjured himself and reignited calls for his impeachment.\n\n\u201cBrett M. Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people,\u201d presidential contender Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) said Sunday of last year\u2019s confirmation hearings. \u201cHe was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached.\u201d\n\nSince Saturday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, also Democratic presidential candidates, pushed for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment, too.\n\nDemocratic candidates demand Kavanaugh impeachment after new allegation in Times piece\n\nWhat is impeachment?\n\nAt the constitutional Convention of 1787, the delegates concluded that even those holding the highest office would not be above the law, birthing the American system of impeachment.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the president, the vice president and \u201call civil Officers of the United States\u201d (including those in the executive branch, plus federal judges) may be removed from office for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d The procedure for impeaching a president or a federal judge is broadly the same.\n\nThere are two parts to the process:\n\nThe House is entrusted with the responsibility of voting on impeachment. Its members decide by a majority vote.\n\nThen the Senate holds a trial for the underlying misconduct. A conviction requires two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes. If there is a conviction, the Senate would remove the individual from office.\n\nHow likely is Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment and removal?\n\nImpeachment proceedings are contingent on Democrats controlling the House, the only body that can bring an article of impeachment. The current House breakdown is 235 Democrats, 198 Republicans, one Independent and one vacancy, according to the Cook Political Report, which puts impeachment in the realm of political possibility.\n\nYet Kavanaugh\u2019s removal is exceedingly unlikely, given the supermajority threshold in the Senate, where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. The \u201csupermajority\u201d threshold for removal is exceedingly high by design: The delegates crafted it to prevent politics from driving the outcome, instead ensuring any misconduct was offensive enough to have bipartisan support for removal.\n\nNineteen federal officials \u2014 including 15 judges and two presidents \u2014 have been impeached, but fewer than half have been removed by the Senate, because of the supermajority standard.\n\nThe most famous cases resulted in impeachment but not removal. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were the only two presidents to be impeached by the House. Each reached the Senate for trial, but both were acquitted, Johnson by a single vote. Neither was removed from office.\n\nOnly one sitting Supreme Court justice \u2014 Samuel Chase \u2014 was impeached, on charges of being too partisan in 1805. As with Johnson and Clinton, Chase was acquitted by the Senate and continued to serve.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 messy messaging on impeachment, explained\n\nWhat are judges impeached for?\n\nThere isn\u2019t a clear definition of \u201cimpeachable offense,\u201d though historically that is often framed by statutory felonies and involves a significant abuse of power, according to Jed Shugerman, a professor at Fordham University School of Law and expert in constitutional law. \u201cCurrent culture has also changed our understanding of what an abuse of power is,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 1970, arguing for the impeachment of Justice William O. Douglas, then-Rep. Gerald Ford (R-Mich.) defined impeachable offenses as \u201cwhatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history \u2026 Something less than a criminal act or criminal dereliction of duty may nevertheless be sufficient grounds for impeachment.\u201d\n\nDouglas was never impeached; the hearings held by the House Judiciary Committee produced no credible evidence and concluded without a vote.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear, however, is that perjury is a significant offense, especially for a judge.\n\nThe question of lying under oath is particularly important for someone who would be or is a member of the judiciary, according to Graves, the former Senate Judiciary Committee lawyer who called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment after his confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\nA judge, she said, is a symbol of integrity and the law. To the extent that a judge\u2019s integrity is tainted, it disables that person from being able to continue as a judge.\n\n\u201cLawyers are officers of the court,\u201d Graves told The Post. \u201cCourts rule on matters and assess witness credibility all the time, so honesty, integrity and truthfulness are paramount qualities for a judge.\u201d\n\nThis principle is evidenced by prior successful judicial impeachment proceedings:\n\nAlcee L. Hastings was impeached and removed from the bench for perjury in 1988. (Hastings now serves in Congress, as a Democrat representing Florida\u2019s 20th District.) Walter L. Nixon was impeached and removed for lying to a grand jury in 1989. Most recently, Thomas Porteous Jr. was impeached and removed for committing perjury on financial disclosures in 2010.\n\nClinton\u2019s impeachment was also based on his alleged lying under oath during a deposition, a proceeding that Kavanaugh was intimately familiar with from his time working on special prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr\u2019s investigative team.\n\n\u201cEven though our political discourse has been defiled by the proliferation of so many politicians\u2019 lies, the rules for testifying under oath, whether it\u2019s at the U.S. Senate, trial or deposition, is one of the only sacred vows in a secular society. It should be taken seriously because of that,\u201d Graves said. \"[Kavanaugh] certainly held President Clinton to that standard. He\u2019s not above the law any more than the president is above the law.\u201d\n\nNow what?\n\nFor now, the burden rests with the House.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the House Judiciary Committee quickly moves to reinvestigate Kavanaugh and draft articles of impeachment.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who chairs the committee, has previously said he would support such an action. In August, he requested the National Archives release records from Kavanaugh\u2019s time in the George W. Bush\u2019s White House.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story includes earlier reporting from October 2018.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe top 15 Democratic presidential candidates, ranked\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s and Cory Booker\u2019s risky attacks on Joe Biden\u2019s sharpness\n\nWinners and losers from the third Democratic debate", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Brett M.
