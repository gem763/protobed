So how do such busy billionaire founders like Musk and Dorsey manage their days? Here are Musk's, Dorsey's and other successful business leaders' tips on maximizing productivity.\n\nJack Dorsey has meetings from a Google Doc\n\nTwitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey gestures while interacting with students at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi on November 12, 2018.

When it comes to meetings, Jack Dorsey has a non-traditional approach that he believes speeds up the critical thinking process, as Resume.io points out. \"Most of my meetings are now Google doc-based, starting with 10-minutes of reading and commenting directly in the doc,\" Dorsey tweeted in 2018. \"This practice makes time for everyone to get on same page, allows us to work from many locations, and gets to truth/critical thinking faster.\" The social media exec referenced a Twitter thread by Steven Sinofsky, the former Windows Division President at Microsoft, to support his Google Doc method. Sinofsky explained the potential up-side to writing during meetings as opposed to traditional ones. \"Writing is more inclusive,\" Sinofsky said. \"It is easier to contribute, doesn't reward bullies and bulls---ers, and allows for contemplation.\"\n\nElon Musk eliminates excessive meetings\n\nElon Musk speaks onstage during the E3 conference in Los Angeles on June 13, 2019.

That's because \"speed matters in business,\" he said in his 2016 letter to shareholders. \"Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70 percent of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90 percent, in most cases, you're probably being slow.\" In fact, whether you make the right decision can actually be less important than making one quickly, according to Bezos. \"Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors\u2014 for those, so what if you're wrong?\" You need to be good at quickly correcting bad decisions, he said, but \"if you're good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.\" Amazon \"is determined to keep our decision-making velocity high\" not only because it's important, said Bezos, but also because a \"high-velocity decision making environment is more fun too.\"\n\nSteve Jobs knew when to say 'no'\n\nApple Inc.'s former CEO, the late Steve Jobs, announces the new iPad on January 27, 2010 in San Francisco, California.

In fact, billionaire Warren Buffett shares Jobs' mindset, once saying \"the difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say 'no' to almost everything.\"\n\nBill Gates sharpens his focus through meditation", "description": "Despite how it may feel, everyone has the same amount of time in a day as people like Elon Musk, who is CEO of not just Tesla, but also SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink, and Jack Dorsey, who is CEO of both Twitter and Square.
