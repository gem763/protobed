And Goldman Sachs making a bullish call to defend a company\u2019s shares is not exactly news either. But combine the two and add in price charts that confirm a bottom, and it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s plenty of potential in some underloved stocks. Specifically, I\u2019m talking about the diversified and superior potential in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN).\n\nThere are bulls in investing and then there\u2019s Goldman Sachs. One of the market\u2019s most storied investment firms certainly maintains reasons for being generally optimistic in its market calls. That\u2019s not to say Goldman isn\u2019t making prop side bets or that it\u2019s always bullish. But when it comes to paying customers, underwriting and the likes, a bull market is good for business.\n\nGiven how this well-oiled machine operates, a buy recommendation from Goldman isn\u2019t exactly a rarity. Nevertheless, when the firm\u2019s chief U.S. strategist acknowledges major market headwinds, but sees superior upside potential in several undervalued stocks \u2014 such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) \u2014 with 50% or more upside, it\u2019s time to take notice.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut from there, we can whittle down that list of names to these three stocks to buy, since they have charts that can actually justify all the fuss. With that said, let\u2019s dive a little deeper into what makes AAL, UAA and REGN stock worth a buy.\n\n\n\n\n\nUndervalued Stocks to Buy: American Airlines (AAL)\n\nUndervalued Stocks to Buy: American Airlines (AAL) More\n\nAs most investors may be aware, AAL stock has been left behind over the past few years while the broader market has continued to rally to all-time-highs. Shares are also down several percentage points since Goldman\u2019s initial call.\n\nBut now AAL looks ready to take-off!\n\nAmerican Airlines\u2019 weekly chart has confirmed a large pattern double bottom dating back to 2016 with a smaller variation of this formation. With shares of this undervalued stock also showing a supportive stochastics divergence during the development of the just-completed double bottom, it\u2019s time to go long AAL stock with confidence.\n\nAAL Stock Strategy: Goldman sees upside potential nearing 60% over the next 12 months for this undervalued stock. Use the failure of the paired double bottoms to contain losses if needed and take initial profits at $35 for a stronger risk-adjusted position.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Armour (UAA)\n\nUndervalued Stocks to Buy: Under Armour (UAA) More\n\nUnder Armour is the next of our undervalued stocks to buy. Shares have been rallying for the last two years since initially falling out of favor with growth investors back in 2016, which was compounded by a series of missteps and earnings disappointments. But while UAA stock has gained ground since bottoming in 2017, as this past summer\u2019s price action attests, it hasn\u2019t been without incident.\n\nThe good news is right now the home field advantage on the price chart goes to bullish investors in shares of Under Armour.\n\nUAA Stock Strategy: Goldman sees about 65% upside possible for UAA stock. I see diversification, a stop-loss slightly beneath the higher-low pattern low at $17.35 and a bonafide slam dunk if this undervalued stock can capture the firm\u2019s price objective. However, I\u2019d gladly take the opportunity to trim profits along the way and inside the last earnings gap near $25 a share.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegeneron (REGN)\n\nUndervalued Stocks to Buy: Regeneron (REGN) More", "description": "Undervalued stocks are nothing new on Wall Street.
