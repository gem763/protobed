What is usually a solemn, formal prorogation ceremony erupted into raucous scenes as opposition lawmakers in the House of Commons chamber shouted \"Shame on you\" and held up signs reading \"Silenced.\"\n\nCommons Speaker John Bercow expressed his displeasure at Parliament's suspension, saying \"this is not a standard or normal prorogation.\"\n\n\"It's one of the longest for decades and it represents an act of executive fiat,\" he said.\n\nThe prime minister has had a turbulent week since Parliament returned from its summer break on Sept. 3. He kicked 21 lawmakers out of the Conservative group in Parliament after they sided with the opposition, and saw two ministers quit his government \u2014 one of them his own brother.\n\nParliament's suspension ended a day of blows to the embattled Johnson. First an opposition-backed measure designed to stop Britain from crashing out of the EU on Oct. 31 without a divorce deal became law after receiving the formal assent of Queen Elizabeth II. The law compels the government to ask the EU for a three-month delay if no deal has been agreed by Oct. 19.\n\nJohnson says the country's delayed exit must happen at the end of October, with or without a divorce agreement to smooth the way. But many lawmakers fear a no-deal Brexit would be economically devastating, and are determined to stop him.\n\n\"I will not ask for another delay,\" Johnson said. But he has few easy ways out of it. His options \u2014 all of them extreme \u2014 include disobeying the law, which could land him in court or even prison, and resigning so that someone else would have to ask for a delay.\n\nLegislators also demanded the government release, by Wednesday, emails and text messages among aides and officials relating to suspending Parliament and planning for Brexit amid allegations that the suspension is being used to circumvent democracy.\n\nUnder parliamentary rules, the government is obliged to release the documents.\n\nIn a statement, the government said it would \"consider the implications of this vote and respond in due course.\"\n\nThen, early Tuesday, lawmakers rebuffed, for a second time, Johnson's request for an early election, which he said was \"the only way to break the deadlock in the House.\"\n\nOpposition parties voted against the measure or abstained, denying Johnson the two-thirds majority he needed. They want to make sure a no-deal departure is blocked before agreeing to an election.\n\n\"We're eager for an election, but as keen as we are we, we are not prepared to inflict the disaster of a no deal on our communities, our jobs, our services, or indeed our rights,\" Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said.\n\nJohnson acknowledged Monday that a no-deal Brexit \"would be a failure of statecraft\" for which he would be partially to blame.\n\nOn a visit to Dublin, Johnson said he would \"overwhelmingly prefer to find an agreement\" and believed a deal could be struck by Oct. 18, when leaders of all 28 EU countries hold a summit in Brussels.\n\nThe comments marked a change of tone, if not substance, for Johnson, who is accused by opponents of driving Britain at full-tilt toward a cliff-edge Brexit.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned Johnson that \"there's no such thing as a clean break,\" and if Britain crashed out, it would \"cause severe disruption for British and Irish people alike.\"\n\nJohnson and Varadkar said they had \"a positive and constructive meeting,\" but there was no breakthrough on the issue of the Irish border, the main stumbling block to a Brexit deal.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The simmering showdown between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Britain's Parliament over Brexit came to a head as lawmakers delivered three defeats to the government's plans for leaving the European Union, before being sent home early Tuesday for a contentious five-week suspension of the legislature", "authors": ["Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K2Xc1XDGfR3JB_u3tHKbNA--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/b2a20825c9b1e9bf0068f65a1a16b6eb", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
