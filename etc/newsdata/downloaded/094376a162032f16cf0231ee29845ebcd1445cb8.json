(AP) - Notre Dame coach Mike Brey can\u2019t help but feel a bit of excitement simply by what he doesn\u2019t see around the Atlantic Coast Conference from last year.\n\nNo Zion Williamson putting on a nightly one-man highlight reel.\n\nTen players out the door as NBA first-round draft picks.\n\nAnd almost no returning all-conference players.\n\n\u201cWhat kept me going all offseason was I kept looking at the first- and second-team all-ACC,\u201d Brey quipped Tuesday during the league\u2019s preseason media day. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all gone.\u201d\n\nNow the tradition-rich ACC is waiting to see who will step into the national spotlight this year.\n\nThe league is coming off its third national championship in five seasons and there never seems to be a shortage of star power. But that\u2019s about to be tested after losing marquee talents, including national player of the year Williamson and fellow Duke freshman RJ Barrett - who were among the top three NBA draft picks. Also gone is a trio of players in De\u2019Andre Hunter, Ty Jerome and Kyle Guy who helped Virginia capture the crown in the spring.\n\nThat leaves plenty of room for this year\u2019s players and incoming recruits to make a name for themselves. It also leaves uncertainty about who will emerge in a season that includes the ACC\u2019s first 20-game conference schedule.\n\n\u201cI think the college game - our program was involved earlier with one-and-done and early entry - I think it\u2019s just caught up to everybody, especially with kids now being able to test the (NBA) waters,\u201d Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to see newness, more newness throughout the league, especially a league of our stature.\n\n\u201cThese kids get prepared for the pros by being in the best conference. It makes it wide open, I think, for the league this year.\u201d\n\nThe ACC will release voting results Thursday on who is the league favorite and who made the preseason all-ACC team. But only two of 15 players from last year\u2019s all-conference postseason teams are back for consideration this year: third-teamers Jordan Nwora of Louisville and John Mooney of Notre Dame.\n\nThat\u2019s the lowest total in three decades, going back to when the league added a third team for its conference honors during the 1989-90 season.\n\nThe list of names that are gone is impressive.\n\nThe ACC had six lottery picks to set a modern NBA draft record in June with Williamson, Barrett, Hunter, North Carolina\u2019s Coby White and Cameron Johnson, and Duke\u2019s Cam Reddish.\n\nThrow in Guy, and that makes four Associated Press All-Americans who are gone - not to mention Guy was the Final Four most outstanding player from the Cavaliers\u2019 title run before being a second-round NBA pick.\n\nThere are some eager to claim their piece of that spotlight.\n\n\u201cIn my head, I\u2019m totally like, \u2018Those guys are gone? It\u2019s time to eat,\u2019\u201d said Georgia Tech\u2019s James Banks III, a 6-foot-10 senior who averaged 10.5 points, 7.7 rebounds and a league-best 2.5 blocks.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Commissioner John Swofford said while talent turnover is not uncommon by itself, it\u2019s usually \u201cnot to those numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just part of the landscape,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cAnd some years, you\u2019re going to have that when programs attract the quality of players that are attracted to this league. I don\u2019t look at it as necessarily good or bad.\n\n\u201cSelfishly, in a perfect world, would I as commissioner like to have those really good players a few more years? Yes. But that\u2019s not the world and it\u2019s not going to be our world.\u201d\n\nThere are a few candidates to fill that void.\n\nNwora (17 points, 7.6 rebounds per game) and Mooney (14.1 points, ACC-best 11.2 rebounds) are set to thrive at the forefront of veteran teams positioned to capitalize on experience gained last year playing against future NBA draft picks.\n\n\u201cThe thing with the ACC, there\u2019s always star power coming,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cThe league always kind of reloads, so you have to respect that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the next wave of stars could start with the new group of incoming freshmen headlined by North Carolina\u2019s Cole Anthony and Duke\u2019s Vernon Carey.\n\nACC Network analyst Jordan Cornette said it will take patience for teams to sort things out with players in new leading roles, particularly with 14 of the 15 teams set to open the season with conference matchups as part of the network\u2019s launch this year.\n\n\u201cThese (incoming) guys are really good,\u201d said Cornette, who played at Notre Dame from 2001-05. \u201cIt\u2019s just now the standard for what\u2019s true stardom coming in has shifted because a guy like Zion was just from another stratosphere. Now that that\u2019s left college basketball and all these names have left with it, it\u2019s easy to think, \u2018Well, it\u2019s going to be a down year.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised by how many talented players who are coming in and are going to make an immediate difference right away.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Notre Dame coach Mike Brey can't help but feel a bit of excitement simply by what he doesn't see around the Atlantic Coast Conference from last year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aaron Beard"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/acc_media_day_basketball_30367_c0-156-3730-2330_s1770x1032.jpg?b341cd2bec53a0270d8cd1b470f1b423415562f9", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
