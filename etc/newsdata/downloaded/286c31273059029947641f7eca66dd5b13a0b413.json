He Was A Participant.'", "language": "en", "text": "Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has accused Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew of raping her three times at the behest of Jeffrey Epstein when she was a minor, told her story to NBC in an interview set to air Friday.\n\n\u201cHe was an abuser. He was a participant,\u201d Giuffre, now in her mid-30s, told NBC News\u2019 Savannah Guthrie in a segment broadcast on the \u201cToday\u201d show. A longer version of the interview airs later on Friday on Dateline NBC.\n\nGiuffre claimed in a 2015 lawsuit that she was recruited to have sex with Epstein and his friends, including Prince Andrew, by the financier\u2019s alleged madame, Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell allegedly enlisted Giuffre when she was 15, when she was working at President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nGiuffre has previously alleged that Prince Andrew was among the men Epstein forced her into sex with during his around-the-world abuse trips. Her NBC interview, however, is her first since Andrew\u2019s statement in August repeating his vehement denial of her allegations.\n\n\u201cThat first time in London, I was so young. Ghislaine woke me up in the morning and she said, \u2018You\u2019re going to meet a prince today.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know at that point that I was going to be trafficked to that prince,\u201d Giuffre told NBC.\n\n\u201cGhislaine said, \u2018He\u2019s coming back to the house. And I want you to do for him [Prince Andrew] what you do for Epstein,\u2019\u201d Giuffre added. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t believe that even royalty was involved.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew has steadfastly denied the rape allegations since Giuffre first came forward years ago.\n\nDan Kitwood via Getty Images Prince Andrew The Duke of York arrives at the Headquarters of CrossRail in Canary Wharf on March 7, 2011 in London. Prince Andrew has been accused by Virginia Roberts Giuffre of raping her when she was a teenager.\n\nGiuffre was joined in the interview by five other women who say Epstein sexually abused them when they were teenagers. One of them, Anouska De Georgiou, reflected on how hard it\u2019s been to come forward with her story, even with the support of so many others who say they had similar experiences.\n\n\u201cI think the nature of this kind of abuse is that you\u2019re conditioned to be silenced, to be isolated, secretive and shameful,\u201d De Georgiou said.\n\nEpstein was found dead from suspected suicide in his New York City jail cell in August while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking underage girls. Prosecutors said the financier abused dozens of girls on private islands and at his Manhattan mansion, his home in Palm Beach, Florida, and his New Mexico ranch.\n\nAlthough the criminal case against Epstein has ended, prosecutors have vowed to continue investigating any co-conspirators, who could be criminally charged. Epstein\u2019s accusers may also pursue civil litigation against the financier\u2019s estate.", "description": "\"I couldn\u2019t believe that even royalty was involved,\" Virginia Roberts Giuffre said in an NBC interview.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d850b6c2100005d00d4c09f.png?cache=4abpwebhxf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
