To these voters, it\u2019s understandable why the prospect of Uncle Joe, wrapping his arm around America and saying it\u2019s going to be all right, has resonated deeper now than it did when Biden and top aides first started privately laying out a potential campaign pitch over two years ago, still early into Trump\u2019s first term\u2026\n\nHis campaign isn\u2019t coy about how much he owes to Trump. In a conference call with reporters last week, a person who according to the ground rules set for listening could only be identified as a \u201csenior campaign official,\u201d said, \u201cWe think voters are really in a serious mood,\u201d adding, \u201cthe fear about [Trump] being reelected is deep and it\u2019s defined.\u201d This person insisted that the campaign\u2019s research shows voters are inclined to choose Biden for his character and sense of stability, not just as a guy who can beat Trump. \u201cProbably the most common word used to define Trump these days is \u2018erratic,\u2019\u201d the campaign official said. \u201cFour years ago, the most common word to describe Trump was \u2018disruptor\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s a totally different calculation. It\u2019s actually a very complicated and detailed assessment that voters have.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s familiar,\u201d said Laryssa Rod from Sommerville, Massachusetts. Rod had also been at the convention and was wearing a T-shirt that read Literally Anybody Else. \u201cEverybody\u2019s terrified that Trump\u2019s going to get re-elected,\u201d she added. Rod said she\u2019s a big Warren supporter, though she was waiting to see Buttigieg at the picnic, too.", "description": "", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Is-Joe-Biden-Winning-Race"], "top_image": ""}
