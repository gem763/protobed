This fight is probably going to be the most-watched fight of the year.\n\n\u201cIt is crazy, but they are at least respecting the code. They\u2019ve turned pro, no head guards, 10oz gloves. I don\u2019t think they know what they have let themselves in for on that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadness, total madness. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Staples Center is going to be crazy and hopefully we can grow the sport and keep these fans in the sport, and show them some greatness while we\u2019re there with Devin and Billy.\u201d\n\nHearn has quite the task at hand, keeping a huge audience interested in watching boxing, and not to just tune in to see their YouTube idols.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve trained hard, they\u2019re in good shape, they can fight, but now the responsibility on us is to make sure that we showcase great boxing to this new audience,\u201d said Hearn.\n\n\u201cEven if we can keep one per cent, it\u2019s great for boxing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Devin Haney, Billy Joe Saunders are probably going to be on the undercard as well, because it\u2019s one thing attracting millions of new fans to the sport, can we keep them?
