There is no redemption at all. It is a lot grimmer to watch than even Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker in \u2018The Dark Knight\u2019,\u201d said David Crow, an associate editor at pop culture website Den of Geek.\n\nPhoenix, 44, whose performance is seen by awards watchers as a likely contender for a best actor Oscar next year, told reporters in Venice in August, \u201cI didn\u2019t refer to any past creations of this character.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: A billboard advertising the film \"Joker\" is pictured in Los Angeles, California, U.S., October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nLARGELY A PRANKSTER\n\nPhoenix\u2019s take on the Joker is far removed from Cesar Romero, who was the first actor to play the role in the 1960s \u201cBatman\u201d television series, which was mainly aimed at children.\n\n\u201cRomero didn\u2019t even shave his moustache for the role. He put the make-up on top of the moustache. He had a lot of fun with it,\u201d said Crow.\n\nIn 1989, Jack Nicholson brought his edgy, maniacal touch to the character in the \u201cBatman\u201d movie but was still largely a prankster.\n\nLedger reinvented him as unsettling and unhinged in 2008 in \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d in 2008, when the Joker became a terrorist in a post-Sept. 11 2001 era beset by fears of anarchy and chaos.\n\nYet Ledger, who won a posthumous supporting actor Oscar for the role, \u201cstill played it a bit like a rock star, there was a bit of grunge glamour,\u201d said Crow.\n\n\u201cBatman gets to stop him in the end. He does blow up a hospital but he never took it to a truly irredeemable place,\u201d added Crow.\n\nPhoenix, by contrast, turns in a performance so nerve-wracking that it is difficult to watch at times, said Belloni.\n\n\u201cIf this was not a comic book character it would be among the most chilling characters I have ever seen in film. It\u2019s really disturbing,\u201d Belloni said.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe film has an R rating in the United States, meaning those under 17 need to be accompanied by a parent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for kids, and they won\u2019t like it anyway,\u201d the Alamo Drafthouse movie theatre chain said in a warning on its website ahead of the opening weekend.\n\n(The story corrects last name throughout of Den of Geek associate editor David Crow)", "description": "There are no capes, no special powers and no battles between good and evil in the new \"Joker\" movie, whose portrayal of the most famous villain in comic book history is the most chilling twist on the character in 50 years.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436810986&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921V6"}
