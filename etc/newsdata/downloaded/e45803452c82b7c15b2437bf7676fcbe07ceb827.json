With an epic takedown of Polish GM Jan-Krzysztof Duda in Round 4 (which took seven games and was decided in a blitz playoff), Xiong, 18, is the lowest seed to make it to the Elite Eight \u2014 with a shot at a slot in the 2020 world championship cycle.\n\nXiong\u2019s biggest win was a Round 3 upset of No. 2 seed GM Anish Giri, eliminating the Dutch star in a tense Game/10 playoff battle. We pick the play up in this Reti Opening from the diagram, where Xiong as Black has sacrificed a pawn for strong pressure on the White king.\n\nThe young American proves better in the ensuing tactical clash: 24\u2026b5 25. f5? (missing Black\u2019s idea; it was found later that the unlikely 25. Qh3! is the only way to save the game \u2014 e.g. 25\u2026a4 [Nxd5?! 26. Rxf7+! Kxf7 27. Qxh7+ Kf8 28. Qh6+ Kf7 29. Qh7+, and 29\u2026Kf6?? is out because of 30. Nxd5+] 26. Rxf7+! Kxf7 27. Qe6+ Kg7 28. Qe7+ Kg8 29. Qe6+ Kg7 30. Qe7, with a draw. Black is also better after 25. Rb7 Ne4! 26. Nxe4 Rxc2+ 27. Rxc2 Rxc2+ 28. Qxc2 Nxc2 29. N2c3 Ne3 30. Rxb5 Qd4 31. Rxa5 Nd1+ 32. Kc2 Nxc3 33. Nxc3 Qxf4) Rxc3! 26. Nxc3 Rxc3, and now 27. Qxc3 loses the queen to 27\u2026Nc4+.\n\nXiong takes the game and the match after 27. Qe2 Nc4+ 28. Ka1 Ne5 (White has a rook and pawn for two knights, but his terrible king position spells his doom) 29. fxg6 hxg6 30. Rf1 Qd4 31. Kb1 Nxd5 32. Rd1 Rd3! 33. Rxd3 Nxd3 34. Qxd3 (cxd3 Nc3+) Qxd3 35. Rxf7+ Kxf7 36. cxd3 Nf4, and White resigned a hopeless ending.\n\n\u2013\n\nIt\u2019s not often you see a player start a 10-player invitational with a draw and a loss \u2014 including a loss to a top rival with White \u2014 and go on to win the event by two full points. So all hail the performance of GM Ray Robson at the recent St. Louis Fall Chess Classic, where a closing kick of six wins and a draw in the last seven round brought him clear first by a wide margin in the Category 16 event earlier this month.\n\nFans of blocked positions will love Robson\u2019s Round 6 Steinitz French Defense win over veteran GM Varuzhan Akobian, where the timely 18. Nd1 Rf7 19. Ng5! Bxg5 (Rf8 20. Ne3! [Nxe6 Nxb4 21. cxb4 Qxe6 22. Ne3 is less convincing] Nd8 21. g4, with the clear initiative) 20. fxg5 Ne7 21. h4 leaves White with the only potential pawn break on the board.\n\nAlready, one could say White\u2019s humble pawn on g2 is the most important asset on the board, the indispensable lever to crack open the game. After a lengthy preparatory phase, including a king walk to the queenside, Robson is ready to strike: 43. Rf1 (every White piece is on an optimal square and the h-file rook\u2019s domination along the sixth rank will soon prove critical) Qe8 44. g4! (finally \u2014 Black\u2019s cramped but solid position collapses inexorably) fxg4 45. Bxg4 Be4 46. Qf2, when 46\u2026Nf5 is met by 47. Nxe6+ Nxe6 48. Bxf5 Nxg5 49. Rb6! Bxf5 50. e6!, and the White queen will invade via the h2-b8 diagonal.\n\nWith 49. Rxe6 Rxg4, Akobian claims a nominal material edge, but the White invasion can\u2019t be stopped: 50. Qf7 (Qf6! was also very strong) Rg2+ 51. Kc1 Qxf7 (Kd7 52. Rd6+ Kc7 53. Qxe8) 52. Rxf7 Rc2+ 53. Kd1 Rxc3 54. Rfxe7+ Kd8 55. Re8+ Kd7 56. Rce7+, and Black resigns as 56\u2026Kc6 57. Rc8 is mate.\n\nWhite\u2019s patient breakthrough here was positional play of the highest order against a very experienced opponent.\n\nRobson-Akobian, St. Louis Fall Chess Classic, St. Louis, September 2019\n\n1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.
