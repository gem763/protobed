Notable pieces in the collection include Eye Flower (1996), an oil on linen by Richard Phillips; Electric Chair (1971), a screenprint by Andy Warhol and Outspan (2008), a significant bronze work by Tony Cragg.\n\nThe 160-room Joule, housed inside a revitalized 1920's neo-Gothic landmark building, is a very good hotel all round\n\nTed is full of praise for his room, 'a delightfully debonair den, with a striking blue sofa, acres of space, a lovely luxury bed and a smart bathroom with a loo and rainfall shower in separate glass cubicles'\n\nThe spa pool at The Joule, which has 'European heat experiences that will take guests through a healing journey'\n\nThere are also beautiful, large-scale mosaics in the lobby.\n\nAnother noteworthy piece in The Joule\u2019s art collection is artist Tony Tasset\u2019s Eye, a 30-foot-tall sculpture of a human eyeball located across from the hotel in an outdoor exhibition and event space.\n\nI was also very impressed with the hotel\u2019s subterranean cocktail bar, Midnight Rambler, a craft cocktail salon with a walnut barreled ceiling that excels at cocktails and, I discovered, burgers and fries.\n\nI could have stayed there for hours and hours \u2013 but I had a cab at an ungodly hour in the morning so my lingering was short-lived.\n\nTed was very impressed with the hotel\u2019s subterranean cocktail bar, Midnight Rambler (pictured)\n\nHotel founder and proprietor Tim Headington has acquired several museum-quality works that are periodically rotated into public areas\n\nOne noteworthy piece in The Joule\u2019s art collection is artist Tony Tasset\u2019s Eye (pictured), a 30-foot-tall sculpture of a human eyeball located across from the hotel in an outdoor exhibition and event space\n\nRooms at The Joule start at $299 (\u00a3235) and suites from $399 (\u00a3315)\n\nMy room \u2013 a \u2018premier\u2019 - was a delightfully debonair den, with a striking blue sofa, acres of space, a lovely luxury bed and a smart bathroom with a loo and rainfall shower in separate glass cubicles.\n\nPlus, I had a view of the eyeball across the way.\n\nAs I trundled off in a cab to the airport at 6am I could only conclude that this hotel is most definitely a joule in the crown of the Texas hotel scene.\n\nTRAVEL FACTS Ted was hosted by The Joule, where rooms prices start at $299 (\u00a3235) and suites from $399 (\u00a3315).

Inside American Airlines' \u00a31.6k business class, with enough legroom for basketball players and headphones that go to 11 for quality\n\nTake a bow.\n\nTake a bow whoever it was who did the deal with Bang & Olufsen to supply the headphones for American Airlines\u2019 business class cabins. Because they are, quite simply, superb. And when I say superb, I mean quality that\u2019s been turned up to 11.\n\nBut on my Boeing 777-300 AA flight from London Heathrow Terminal 3 to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in seat 4A, there\u2019s a delay in reaching the sonic Shangri-La they transport you to because the headphone jack is mysteriously hidden from view.\n\nScroll down for videos\n\nThe American Airlines Boeing 777-300 business class suite features a very long lie-flat seat and comes with Casper bedding\n\nTed at the controls of the Boeing 777 at Heathrow's Terminal 3 before it took him to Dallas\n\nWelcome aboard: Ted is pictured here before take-off at Heathrow with a welcome glass of Champagne... except it's not actually Champagne\n\nThe seriously classy Bang & Olufsen headphones distributed to AA business class passengers\n\nThere is a pin right next to me that the jack for the headset fits perfectly. But it\u2019s inert for the headphones.\n\nSomeone wasn\u2019t paying attention in one of their ergonomics classes.\n\nIn the end, a stewardess comes to the rescue having witnessed my helpless button prodding and looks of bafflement at the fact that the three-pin socket next to me isn\u2019t playing ball.\n\nAs she reveals the mystery socket location \u2013 on the side of a cubby hole you\u2019d need a system of angled mirrors to spot - she freely admits that the situation is a little bizarre.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all.\n\nOther ergonomics modules seemed to have been missed on armrests \u2013 the one to my right is too far away for me to actually rest my arm on \u2013 and storage location. There\u2019s a second good-sized cubby hole for storage available, but I almost have to get on my hands and knees to get to it.\n\nThe buttons for manoeuvring the seat are very well placed, though, just to my left above that phantom headphone socket. The panel also harbours a USB I can plug my phone into, a reading light and the handset for the entertainment screen.\n\nWhich is, pleasingly, pretty good (though not as good as the one on the return 777-200 leg, more of which later...).\n\nOk, the touch screen is a little unresponsive and the screen size is not industry-leading for business class (15.4 inches), but it\u2019s good enough for near-total movie immersion.\n\nThe Boeing 777-300 business class suites occupy some serious cabin real estate. Pictured are Ted's feet\n\nThe ergonomics of the 777-300 business class cabin are generally good, but there are a few bizarre quirks. For instance, the headphone socket is hidden from view in the cubby hole pictured\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES FACTS AND FIGURES American Airlines operates 6,800 daily flights to more than 365 destinations in 61 countries from its hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C.\n\nIt has 130,000 employees that serve more than 200 million customers annually.\n\nSince 2013 American has invested more than $25 billion in its product.\n\nAmerican was recently named a Five Star Global Airline by the Airline Passenger Experience Association and Airline of the Year by Air Transport World.\n\nAmerican is a founding member of One World, whose members serve 1,100 destinations in 180 countries and territories.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the entertainment is available gate-to-gate \u2013 but the cabin crew collect the headphones just before the plane lands. Which is a shame, but not surprising given that they retail for at least \u00a3300 ($380).\n\nWhat else on the tech front?\n\nOh yes, the all-important Wi-Fi. I can report that it works just fine. I pay $19 for it to last the entire flight and it never drops out.\n\nImpressive.\n\nI\u2019m also a fan of the suite\u2019s dimensions.\n\nThe legroom is on the ample side of ample, with the seat transforming into a 6ft 6in bed in lie-flat mode.\n\nI\u2019m 5ft 10in, so plenty of room to stretch out.\n\nThere\u2019s a fairly extensive table area to my left, as well, along with not one but two windows (just like BA\u2019s A380 First suite, but without the powered blinds).\n\nThe seat width, meanwhile, is brilliant, I have to say. Huge.\n\nOr to be precise 21.5 inches \u2013 that\u2019s half an inch wider than BA\u2019s new A350 Club Suite seat. Plenty of wiggle room for the rear-end. And the seat can be adjusted without any hassle into the perfect position.\n\nTwo buttons move the headrest, two more move it horizontally all the way to lie-flat and back and another two move the entire seat back and forth.\n\nPlus, there are one-touch buttons for the bed and take-off and landing positions.\n\nThere\u2019s an amenity kit, of course, placed in that remote cubby hole I mentioned (along with a bottle of water in a little holder).\n\nIt\u2019s by Los Angeles-based luxury leather accessory company This is Ground and is indeed a luxury leather accessory.\n\nIt opens out book-style to reveal two pockets containing lip balm and hand lotion by top beauty brand Allies of Skin (which 'creates smart, effective products for the modern day multi-hyphenate', crucial work I'm sure you'll agree), plus unbranded mouthwash, a cleverly designed toothbrush that clicks into a protective holder, Crest toothpaste, tissues, earplugs, an eye mask, socks and a pen in a looped holder with 'Aviator' written on it.\n\nThere are quality toiletries in the bathrooms, too, by C.O.Bigelow.\n\nThe amenity kit is by Los Angeles-based luxury leather accessory company This is Ground and is indeed a luxury leather accessory, writes Ted\n\nThe amenity kit opens out book-style to reveal two pockets containing lip balm and hand lotion by top beauty brand Allies of Skin, plus unbranded mouthwash, a cleverly designed toothbrush that clicks into a protective holder, Crest toothpaste, tissues, earplugs, an eye mask, socks and a pen in a looped holder with 'Aviator' written on it\n\nTop-quality bedding is also on the inventory - a deluxe pillow and duvet by Casper.\n\nPrivacy screens are becoming all the rage in business classes and this one doesn\u2019t feature them, but it\u2019s no real loss.\n\nI feel cocooned and cosy and no one can see that I\u2019m working my way through the Stars Wars franchise from Episode IV.\n\nAnd I can see only a tiny corner of my neighbour\u2019s screen across the aisle.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s a business class suite that feels like, well, the business. A little care-worn in places - I spy a little bit of glue spillage around the edge of the table veneer and there\u2019s a bit of trim that\u2019s sticking up by the window \u2013 but it definitely conveys the feeling of VIP-ness.\n\nSome might find the decor in the all-direct-aisle-access cabin a little lacking in imagination \u2013 it's all monochromatic grey tones. But I find it unobtrusive and relaxing, and actually quite stylish.\n\nGrey is in, I read somewhere.\n\nAnd I can understand why airlines might plump for plain palettes \u2013 it dates more slowly and so doesn\u2019t need to be overhauled too often.\n\nFor breakfast (pictured) Ted enjoys fresh fruit (melon and pineapple) and a warm fresh and flaky croissant, accompanied by a mouth-watering roasted tomato tart (Brits - this is a popular American brunch dish) and a proper cup of coffee\n\nLunch (pictured) is smoked salmon hash with Bearnaise sauce, vine tomatoes and saut\u00e9ed spinach. A lovely bit of rustic comfort food, writes Ted\n\nWhen quaffing white wine Ted finds that mini cakes with a fresh strawberry are a perfect accompaniment\n\nLuxe loos: There are quality toiletries in the bathrooms, by C.O.Bigelow\n\nTed finds a couple of noticeable imperfections in the 777-300 cabin, including some splodges of glue (left) and a bit of wayward trim (right)\n\nAN EXPERT'S VIEW ON THE AA WINE I show the full American Airlines business class wine list to London-based wine consultant Emily Harman. And she is impressed with some of the choices, but not the welcome fizz... Masia Parera Brut Methode Traditionelle Cava Perhaps a slightly disappointing start? If I fly business, I love to be offered Champagne. Cava in general now is from very low-quality appellations. This is quite a large producer, which is easy to find in supermarkets, so I might skip the aperitif. Collet Brut Champagne, France A lesser-known producer but quite interesting to offer Champagne that is Pinot dominant, in this case a high percentage of Pinot Meunier. I always find Blanc de Noirs/pinot dominant Champagnes to offer more texture and because of this, they tend to appeal to more people. The whites: Starmont Chardonnay Carneros, California, and Campo alle Comete Vermentino Toscana, Italy Lovely to see a nice alternative to Sauvignon Blanc in the whites on offer. Especially as we are now entering summer. A chilled Vermentino would be a great lighter, aromatic option to the Chardonnay. The reds: Imagery Cabernet Sauvignon, California, and Corte Giara La Groletta Ripasso Valpolicella, Italy Two very full-bodied options for the reds. It is a shame not to offer a lighter or at least medium-bodied options for the red wine drinkers on board. Dessert wine: Quinta do Noval LBV Port, Portugal An iconic port estate producing high quality wines. I would very happily sip a glass or two of this port, especially if there was a chocolate dessert anywhere within reach!\n\nThere are similarly high standards in the food, drink and service departments.\n\nThe flight departs at 8.40am and, it being breakfast time, I naturally accept the offer of Champagne when I board.\n\nExcept it's not Champagne.\n\nIt\u2019s actually Masia Parera Brut Methode Traditionelle Cava. An ok cava. But you can only call sparkling wine Champagne if it\u2019s made in the Champagne region of France.\n\nHow do I discover it\u2019s not Champagne? To my shame \u2013 despite my WSET 1 qualification \u2013 not because I tasted the difference, but because later a stewardess pours me a glass of fizz and tells me that it\u2019s \u2018better than the fizz served upon boarding\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly highly quaffable.\n\nI\u2019d later ask American Airlines - BA's major codeshare partner - what was afoot vis and vis the fizz, and it confirms that what\u2019s served mid-flight is Collet Brut ($34/\u00a327 a bottle) Champagne, as per the menu, but what\u2019s served before take-off is said cava.\n\nWhy? Something about mid-flight beverages being \u2018duty free\u2019.\n\nI get it. It\u2019s a money-saving ploy. But perhaps those boarding could be offered \u2018bubbles\u2019 or \u2018Spanish fizz\u2019 or \u2018a sparkling pick-me-up' to avoid accusations of deception.\n\nAnyway, moving further down the list, a glass of Starmont Chardonnay Carneros from California that I try later is super - well-mannered and full of perky lemony flavours.\n\nHowever, the white Campo alle Comete Vermentino Toscana (average price around \u00a312-14 per bottle), from Italy, is a let-down. The wine list really talks it up, waxing lyrical about its \u2018mineral freshness\u2019 and \u2018aromatic floral notes\u2019.\n\nBut I don\u2019t get any of that. To me, it\u2019s just a semi-decent party wine with a slightly sharp finish.\n\nI\u2019m a little surprised I don\u2019t like it because American Airlines proudly boasts that master sommelier Bobby Stuckey put the list together. There\u2019s even a picture of him on the menu \u2013 grinning - alongside a brief biography.\n\nThis suggests confidence in the selection.\n\nAlso, the Campo alle Comete is favourably reviewed online (and a wine consultant I show the list to is impressed with this choice, see boxout). Perhaps the altitude has skewed my taste buds...\n\nI\u2019m 100 per cent impressed with the food, though. From start to finish, through every course, every plate delights and is nicely presented.\n\nFor breakfast fresh fruit (melon and pineapple) and a warm fresh and flaky croissant are accompanied by a mouth-watering roasted tomato tart (Brits - this is a popular American brunch dish) and a proper cup of coffee.\n\nMy main plate for lunch is smoked salmon hash with Bearnaise sauce, vine tomatoes and saut\u00e9ed spinach. A lovely bit of rustic comfort food.\n\nThen I enjoy a little dish of delicious mini cakes with a fresh strawberry. Perfect with white wine.\n\nJust before touch-down in Dallas a plate of mini chicken and leek, and mushroom and spinach, pies arrive, along with more fresh fruit and a marvellously moreish salted caramel and chocolate ganache.\n\nThe a la carte menu for the flight from London to Dallas (left). Pictured right is Bobby Stuckey's business class wine list\n\nAnd the crockery? All porcelain pieces by deSter, which is a major airline supplier. But it\u2019s good quality stuff.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a dining experience far, far removed from any economy or premium economy cabin offering.\n\nAll that\u2019s lacking for me is a dine-on-demand option which, for instance, Qatar Airways offers in business class.\n\nThe service, meanwhile, is exceptional. I write in my notes that \u2018the cabin crew are a riot\u2019.\n\nBut they don\u2019t just have a flair for fun.\n\nThis is the sort of cabin crew you always really hope you\u2019ll get on a flight \u2013 chirpy, relaxed, friendly, chatty but utterly professional. And generous with the Champagne... And cava.\n\nOrdinarily, here the review would end and, without further ado, I\u2019d present my conclusions.\n\nBut I\u2019m obliged to continue, because on the return overnight flight, from Phoenix (my trip is a mini Texas/Arizona tour), it\u2019s a different plane \u2013 a 777-200, as I mentioned \u2013 and the business class cabin is also different.\n\nAnd mostly in a good way, with the niggles from the journey over now ironed out.\n\nTed flies back from America from Phoenix, but this time in a Boeing 777-200 (actual plane pictured)\n\nTed pictured in the 777-200 business class cabin, which is called SuperDiamond and created by Collins Aerospace\n\nThe niggles Ted finds in the cabin on the way over are now ironed out. He writes: 'The seat is slightly shorter at 72.2 inches (6ft) in lie-flat mode but is a smidgen wider at 21.9 inches and has better back support... The ergonomics, meanwhile, are spot on'\n\nThis image shows Ted's window seat as it appears when he boards (minus the cava). Casper bedding is on the seat and B&O headphones and amenity kit inside a storage bin\n\nThe seat is manoeuvred via touch-screen buttons (pictured). Note the one-touch functions for take-off and landing mode, recline and lie-flat\n\nHello handy storage compartment: AA has tidied away the sockets and remote control in the 777-200 cabin\n\nPrivacy levels are very good. Every passenger is tucked away in their own cocooned suite\n\nFLYING AA FIRST FROM DALLAS TO PHOENIX Well, isn\u2019t this splendid? My sojourn to America includes a two-hour hopper flight from Dallas to Phoenix in Arizona on an American Airlines Airbus A321 in first class. And I\u2019m rather taken with it. Ted's meal on the AA flight to Phoenix The layout is two by two and the reclining seats are huge \u2013 for a domestic service. They\u2019re like executive office chairs, with large arm rests in the middle, slightly bigger than the width of the in-flight magazine. The coffee just keeps on coming via very pleasant stewardesses and there\u2019s a mid-flight snack comprising fresh fruit \u2013 pineapple, grapes, blueberries and a strawberry \u2013 and a yoghurt. It\u2019s served on a little porcelain dish with a napkin, which pleases me. Terrific. Rating:\n\nThe seat \u2013 called a SuperDiamond and made by Collins Aerospace, for any aviation seat nerds out there \u2013 is slightly shorter at 72.2 inches (6ft) in lie-flat mode but is a smidgen wider at 21.9 inches and has better back support.\n\nThe ergonomics, meanwhile, are spot on.\n\nThe armrest to my right is in the perfect position, the headphone jack is not hidden, but is in a very useful easy-to-reach storage compartment with a lid, designed so that when closed, it doesn\u2019t squash the lead.\n\nAnd the TV is a whopper \u2013 an 18-inch touch-screen that\u2019s superbly responsive.\n\nThe seat buttons, I note, are now on a little touch-screen pad. Nifty.\n\nPlus, all the trim is looking... trim.\n\nIt\u2019s a gold star for the food, service and quaffing juices too (great to see you again, Bobby).\n\nI have hickory smoked carrots with a seasonal greens salad for a starter, four-cheese spinach ravioli with creamy Parmesan sauce and blistered cherry tomatoes for mains and an ice-cream sundae for dessert.\n\nAll great.\n\nBreakfast, about an hour before touching down in Heathrow, comprises fresh fruit, bread and yoghurt. All very yummy.\n\nI try one wine \u2013 a cabernet sauvignon from the Imagery Estate in California (\u00a313/$16.50) \u2013 and it\u2019s tremendous. Smooth, soft and rounded.\n\nBobby, you\u2019re back in the circle of trust.\n\nI manage about four hours of solid sleep and disembark feeling fairly spritely.\n\nSo what's the summary? Scroll down...\n\nYum's the word: Ted's starter of hickory smoked carrots with seasonal greens salad. Top right is a cabernet sauvignon from the Imagery Estate in California, which marks Bobby's return to form\n\nFour-cheese spinach ravioli with creamy Parmesan sauce and blistered cherry tomatoes for mains (left).

Rating: Rating key: one star \u2013 poor; two stars \u2013 ok; three stars \u2013 good; four stars \u2013 very good; five stars - exceptional.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, does the world\u2019s biggest airline (by fleet size, revenue, profit and passengers carried) have the world\u2019s best business class?\n\nProbably not.\n\nThat accolade, with some justification, should go to Qatar Airways and its Qsuite.\n\nIs it world-class? Possibly. It\u2019s certainly very good and ticks enough boxes to earn a four-star rating from me.\n\nYou\u2019d have to be a fussy high-flyer indeed not to thoroughly enjoy the experience.\n\nA raising of the eyebrows is understandable with regard to certain aspects of the ergonomics in the 777-300 cabin and that Italian white.\n\nBut once those hi-fidelity B&O headphones are on \u2013 you really won\u2019t care.\n\nBy Ted Thornhill", "description": "The Joule hotel in Dallas is housed inside a revitalized 1920's neo-Gothic landmark building and has an amazing art collection and great bedrooms.
