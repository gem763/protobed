It has been suggested that they may help to seed or \u201cmake\u201d clouds. So reduced GCRs hitting the Earth would mean fewer clouds, which would reflect less sunlight back into space and so cause Earth to warm.\n\nBut there are two problems with this idea. First, the scientific evidence shows that GCRs are not very effective at seeding clouds. And second, over the last 50 years, the amount of GCRs have actually increased, hitting record levels in recent years. If this idea were correct, GCRs should be cooling the Earth, which they aren\u2019t.\n\nEunice Newton Foote\u2019s paper, Circumstances Affecting the Heat of the Sun\u2019s Rays, American Journal of Science, 1857.\n\nThis is an attempt to play a classic common-sense card but is completely wrong. In 1856, American scientist Eunice Newton Foote conducted an experiment with an air pump, two glass cylinders and four thermometers. It showed that a cylinder containing carbon dioxide and placed in the sun trapped more heat and stayed warmer longer than a cylinder with normal air. Scientists have repeated these experiments in the laboratory and in the atmosphere, demonstrating again and again the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide.\n\nAs for the \u201ccommon sense\u201d scale argument that a very small part of something can\u2019t have much of an effect on it, it only takes 0.1 grams of cyanide to kill an adult, which is about 0.0001% of your body weight. Compare this with carbon dioxide, which currently makes up 0.04% of the atmosphere and is a strong greenhouse gas. Meanwhile, nitrogen makes up 78% of the atmosphere and yet is highly unreactive.\n\n4. Scientists manipulate all data sets to show a warming trend\n\nThis is not true and a simplistic device used to attack the credibility of climate scientists. It would require a conspiracy covering thousands of scientists in more than a 100 countries to reach the scale required to do this.\n\nScientists do correct and validate data all the time. For example we have to correct historic temperature records as how they were measured has changed. Between 1856 and 1941, most sea temperatures were measured using seawater hoisted on deck in a bucket. Even this was not consistent as there was a shift from wooden to canvas buckets and from sailing ships to steamships, which altered the height of the ship\u2019s deck \u2013 and these changes in turn altered the amount of cooling caused by evaporation as the bucket was hoisted onto deck. Since 1941, most measurements have been made at the ship\u2019s engine water intakes, so there\u2019s no cooling from evaporation to account for.\n\nWe must also take account that many towns and cities have expanded and so that meteorological stations that were in rural areas are now in urban areas which are usually significantly warmer than the surrounding countryside.\n\nIf we didn\u2019t make these changes to the original measurements, then Earth\u2019s warming over the last 150 years would have appeared to be even greater than the change that has actually been observed, which is now about 1\u02daC of global warming.", "description": "Misinformation and lies are regularly used to undermine the science of climate change \u2013 here's how to see through the fog.", "authors": ["Spandas Lui", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2019/09/Australian-map.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
