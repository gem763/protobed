(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nA federal appeals court on Friday revived a previously-dismissed lawsuit against President Trump, which alleges Trump is violating the Constitution by engaging in business transactions with foreign governments.\n\nIn a 2-1 ruling, a panel of judges from the 2nd Circuit in New York ruled that a lower-court judge had improperly thrown out the lawsuit in December 2017. Now, plaintiffs are hoping this victory will allow them to seek detailed records on Trump\u2019s transactions with foreign officials.\n\nBut, if Trump appeals, as is expected, the case could go to the full 2nd Circuit \u2014 and after that, to the Supreme Court.\n\nThis suit was the first of three major lawsuits alleging Trump violated the emoluments clause.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiffs were Trump\u2019s business competitors: a hotel operator and a group of restaurants and restaurant workers, who say Trump is using the presidency to give his businesses a competitive advantage. Along with hotel rooms and steaks, they say, he can sell something they cannot: access to power, and a chance to please the president.\n\nIn 2017, a District Court judge ruled that the plaintiffs had not proved Trump had actually taken any business away from them. He threw the case out.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s ruling, the two appeals court judges \u2014 both appointed by Democratic presidents \u2014 brought it back. They said it was not necessary to identify a specific customer that Trump had lured away. At least, not at this early stage of the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe district court effectively required plaintiffs to prove, pre-discovery, the facts necessary to win at trial,\u201d judges Pierre N. Leval and Christopher F. Droney wrote. They said that the businesses had plausibly sketched out how they might be affected \u2014 and that was enough to continue to the fact-gathering stage of the case.\n\nJudge John M. Walker, an appointee of President Reagan, dissented and said the case should be thrown out.\n\nThe Justice Department, which is representing Trump in this case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDeepak Gupta, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said the case was intended to enforce the original intent of the Constitution\u2019s framers: to bar presidents from having private business relationships with foreign states.\n\n\u201cEvery time [Trump] illegally obtains payments from foreign governments, those are payments that would have gone to his competitors. So he\u2019s benefiting from illegal competition. He\u2019s deriving an advantage from the office that he holds,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cIt causes both the appearance of corruption \u2014 and actual corruption.\u201d\n\nOf the other two emoluments clause lawsuits, one \u2014 filed by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia \u2014 was dismissed this summer by a different court of appeals in Richmond. The plaintiffs are hoping to revive it. Another, filed by congressional Democrats, is on hold while Trump appeals to another appeals court in Washington.\n\nTrump\u2019s company has not disclosed which foreign governments are its customers, or how much revenue it receives from them. A recently retired Trump Organization executive, George Sorial, said this summer that the company\u2019s foreign revenue was about $1 million in 2018 \u2014 and that 90 percent of that came in through the Trump hotel in downtown Washington.\n\nAnn Marimow contributed to this report.", "description": "The lawsuit was brought by some of Trump\u2019s competitors, who say he\u2019s using the presidency to attract customers.", "authors": ["David A.
