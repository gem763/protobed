Dean was responding to a call from a concerned neighbor who said Jefferson\u2019s door was open.\n\nFort Worth Police Chief Edwin Kraus said he was unable to \u201cmake sense\u201d of Jefferson\u2019s death, saying the only time police should fire into an occupied home was if they were fired upon from within.\n\n\u201cHad the officer not resigned, I would have fired him for violations of several policies,\u201d Kraus told reporters. \u201cDespite his resignation, the officer still faces criminal charges.\u201d\n\nJefferson\u2019s family on Monday called for a federal investigation and Dean\u2019s swift prosecution.\n\n\u201cThis man murdered someone; he should be arrested,\u201d said her brother Darius Carr.\n\nKraus said police had presented the case to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to review Dean\u2019s actions for possible civil rights violations.\n\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price said the city would bring in a panel of national experts to review police actions.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that can justify what happened on Saturday morning, nothing,\u201d Price said.\n\nJefferson was shot dead the same month former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was convicted of shooting and killing unarmed black man Botham Jean inside his own apartment.\n\nBody camera video showed Dean and his partner approaching Jefferson\u2019s home with flashlights. As Dean looks through a bedroom window, he suddenly yells, \u201cPut your hands up, show me your hands,\u201d then fires. He does not identify himself as a police officer.\n\nThe two officers did not knock on the front door of the home and instead went into the backyard, where the shot was fired, Kraus said.\n\nPolice over the weekend released a picture showing a firearm inside Jefferson\u2019s home. Community leaders criticized the move, saying it suggested police were blaming Jefferson for her death.\n\nKraus apologized for publication of the photo, saying Texas homeowners had every right to access a firearm if they believed someone was outside their home.\n\nHe did not know if Jefferson was holding the gun at the time of the incident, adding that the weapon was found \u201cjust inside the window.\u201d", "description": "A white Fort Worth, Texas, police officer has resigned and faces criminal charges after he shot dead a 28-year-old black woman inside her home, the city's police chief said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
