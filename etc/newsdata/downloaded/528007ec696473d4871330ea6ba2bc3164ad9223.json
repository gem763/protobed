(AP) - Everson Griffen burst from his three-point stance and appeared ready to try and beat New York Giants left tackle Nate Solder with speed to the outside.\n\nSolder shuffled to get in position before Griffen used the tackle\u2019s momentum against him to get him off-balance. In one move, Griffen spun and had a wide-open lane to New York rookie quarterback Daniel Jones for a sack.\n\nThe Vikings are used to similar plays from Griffen, their three-time Pro Bowl defensive end. But a year earlier, as Griffen dealt with a mental health concern, no one knew if the team\u2019s energetic leader would ever be the same.\n\nGriffen has returned to form on the field in 2019 and he\u2019s speaking openly about his continued work to deal with his mental health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK to see help,\u201d Griffen said. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to go talk to people. It\u2019s OK to reach out. It\u2019s OK to have some problems in your life. And it\u2019s all about staying consistent with your plan and working your plan day in and day out.\u201d\n\nGriffen\u2019s plan has him back as a vital member of Minnesota\u2019s defense. Griffen, who is seventh in Vikings\u2019 history with 69\u00bd sacks, has three in five games this season. His takedown of Jones on Sunday was one of four sacks in Minnesota\u2019s 28-10 victory.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost is his leadership, and not just with the D-line, just with the whole defense and that echoes to the whole team,\u201d said defensive end Stephen Weatherly, who filled in for Griffen last year. \u201cHe is a team captain for a reason. He is the Energizer \u2026 He is the juice that we use. For him to be back, and also leading by his words but also by his example, it\u2019s just setting the tone for the whole team.\u201d\n\nIn September of last season, Griffen was involved in erratic behavior.\n\nAccording to police at the time, Griffen had made comments about people trying to kill him. He had an incident at a local hotel before later showing up at teammate Trae Waynes\u2019 house without a shirt. He was eventually transported by ambulance to an area hospital, but jumped out of the ambulance at one point before police talked him back in.\n\nGriffen was never arrested or suspected of committing any crimes, but he underwent a mental health evaluation. He was away from the team as he dealt with his health, a move supported by the Vikings, and ended up missing five games.\n\n\u201cIt was really tough,\u201d coach Mike Zimmer recalled recently. \u201cEverson\u2019s really a great person and he cares about the team a lot. He cares about his teammates. He cares about the franchise. He\u2019s one of the hardest working guys we\u2019ve got. From the day I walked in here, he\u2019s been all-in.\n\n\u201cSo, it was disappointing for everybody that that happened to him, but we wanted to make sure that we stuck by him, gave him as much support and help as we possibly could, and he did all the work.\u201d\n\nGriffen appreciated the support from the team. He returned later in the season and finished with 5\u00bd sacks in 11 games.\n\nThe 31-year-old was possibly going to be released in March before his 2019 contract of $10.9 million was set to be guaranteed. But he agreed to a restructured four-year, $58 million contract minutes before the deadline, taking a pay cut to stay with the team that drafted him in the third round in 2010.\n\nHis play on the field in 2019 has shown his dedication, and Minnesota\u2019s, has paid off.\n\n\u201cBeing back to being 100 percent healthy and in my right mind, I\u2019m happy,\u201d Griffen said recently. \u201cSo, I\u2019m going to go out there and play this game with passion, and not anger. I go out there each and every day and I want to give this team all the love and all the passion I have for this game, and let it out there each and every Sunday.\u201d\n\nGriffen, who is ninth in the NFL with 52 sacks since becoming a full-time starter in 2014, could be a candidate for the league\u2019s comeback player of the year. Zimmer said Griffen\u2019s play reminds him of the end\u2019s Pro Bowl years.\n\n\u201cI feel good,\u201d Griffen said this week. \u201cI just take it one day at a time, honestly. One day at a time, you know, and take care of my body. Make sure I\u2019m doing everything to recover and be able to play at a high level. I\u2019m playing good football. I could always play better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Everson Griffen burst from his three-point stance and appeared ready to try and beat New York Giants left tackle Nate Solder with speed to the outside.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Hall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/vikings-resurgent_griffen_football_01791_c0-197-4701-2937_s1770x1032.jpg?643213af278ae73e1fd14095929c7441690d0f47", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
