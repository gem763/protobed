Since September 2014, he has been cared for at home on the shores of Lake Geneva.\n\nLe Parisien, citing sources it did not name, said Schumacher has been treated at least twice previously at the Georges-Pompidou hospital, admitted each time under a false name and treated by a small medical team.\n\nLe Parisien published a photo of a yellow and blue ambulance with Geneva plates that it said drove Schumacher to the hospital on Monday afternoon. Inside, he was taken to a first-floor cardiovascular unit on a gurney with a dark-blue covering that hid his face and body, it said.\n\nIt said about 10 security agents, some equipped with earphones, watched over the patient.\n\nSchumacher's family fiercely protects his privacy. Thick forest surrounding his castle-like home with high surrounding walls provides sanctuary from fan and media intrusion.", "description": "Seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher has been admitted under great secrecy to a Paris hospital to be treated Tuesday with a cutting-edge stem cell therapy, according to a French newspaper.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5277397.1568123770!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/schumacher-michael-121122-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
