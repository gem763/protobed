That makes the U.K. Supreme Court into the guardian of Britain\u2019s constitutional democracy.\n\nWhat\u2019s radical about making the court the protector of democracy is that is displaces Parliament from that traditional role. Under the guise of saving Parliament and its sovereignty, the Supreme Court effectively placed itself above Parliament.\n\nGiven that this has all happened due to the Brexit vote, the greatest irony here is that Britain only has a Supreme Court because European Union rules essentially required it to establish one. To fulfill those requirements, it changed the name and institutional function of its highest judicial body, the old \u201claw lords,\u201d making it independent of Parliament. That\u2019s why the U.K. Supreme Court is just 10 years old, while Parliament can trace itself back to the Middle Ages.\n\nWhen the old law lords, technically a committee of the House of Lords, became the U.K. Supreme Court, defenders of the transformation said it was only a formality. Yet the exercise of judicial review in the prorogation case strongly undermines that decade-old argument. Call a group of judges a Supreme Court, and it will start acting like one.", "description": "", "authors": ["Noah Feldman", "Finance.Yahoo.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
