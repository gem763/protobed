The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases. For current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it was not immediately clear what that would be. The report concluded \u201cthat the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks.\u201d\n\nOne paragraph in the report implicitly criticizes Clinton\u2019s decision to set up the server in the first place:\n\nIt was APD\u2019s determination that the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network\n\nmonitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks. While the use of a private email system itself did not necessarily increase the likelihood of classified information being transmitted on unclassified systems, those incidents which then resulted in the presence of classified information upon it carried an increased risk of compromise or inadvertent disclosure.\n\nBut while the investigation did find dozens of instances in which classified information was mishandled, the report concludes there was no \u201csystemic\u201d attempt to mishandle material.\n\nWhile there were some instances of classified information being inappropriately introduced into an unclassified system in furtherance of expedience, by and large, \u2018the individuals interviewed were aware of security policies and did their best to implement them in their operations. Correspondence with the Secretary is inherently sensitive, and is therefore open for broad interpretation as to classification, particularly with respect to Foreign Government Information. Instances of classified information being deliberately transmitted via unclassified email were the rare exception and resulted in adjudicated security violations. There was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\n\nThere are echoes of James Comey\u2019s conclusion about Hillary\u2019s use of the private server back in 2016:\n\n\u201cAlthough we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is information that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d He added, \u201cNone of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system.\u201d The FBI chief added that \u201cthere was no intentional misconduct.\u201d\n\nSo the bottom line here is some notes will be added to people\u2019s personnel files and, maybe, some disciplinary action will be taken against those who remain in government service. For Hillary, it\u2019s just another slap on the wrist.", "description": "\"...the use of a private email system to conduct official business\u00a0added an increased degree of risk\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hillary-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
