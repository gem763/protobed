(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nSouth Bend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign pulled in more than $1 million from thousands of donations in the immediate aftermath of the fourth Democratic debate, senior campaign adviser Lis Smith announced Wednesday.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 We are officially over $1M raised in the past 24 hours from tens of thousands of donors https://t.co/ceJDEzi8AF \u2014 Lis Smith (@Lis_Smith) October 16, 2019\n\nMultiple news outlets listed Buttigieg as a winner of Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people,\u201d Buttigieg said in his closing statement. \u201cI\u2019m asking for your vote to be that president, when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces, and guide us toward a better future.\u201d\n\nButtigieg sparred with multiple candidates on the stage, engaging Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), the race\u2019s front-runner, on her Medicare-for-All plan, and former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke on his proposal to confiscate assault-style weapons.\n\n\u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general, and Capitol Hill. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward [will be filled],\u201d Buttigieg told the audience after Warren refused to confirm that middle-class taxes would rise to pay for Medicare for All.\n\nSeparately, he challenged O\u2019Rourke\u2019s drastic gun-safety plan in vigorous terms. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the polls, the problem is the policy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d\n\nButtigieg also sparred with Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii), the race\u2019s most isolationist candidate, over President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria. When Gabbard blasted \u201cthe politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war,\u201d he shot back that \u201cthe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of [the] American [troop] presence. It\u2019s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.\u201d", "description": "Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign pulled in more than $1 million from thousands of donations in the immediate aftermath of the fourth Democratic debate.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
