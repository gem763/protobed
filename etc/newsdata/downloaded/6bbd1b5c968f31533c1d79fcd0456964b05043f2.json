We uttered almost in unison: \u2018We made America great,\u2019\u201d one operative at the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency said in the message obtained by the Republican-led committee.\n\nThe long-pending report by the Intelligence panel concluded that Russia directed an aggressive social media campaign to hurt Democrat Hillary Clinton and help Trump in the 2016 presidential election and warns similar efforts to interfere in U.S. politics are still under way. It was a bipartisan endorsement of the finding made by U.S. intelligence agencies and often questioned by Trump.\n\nThe report, two years in the making, found that the Internet Research Agency \u201cwas overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump to the detriment of Secretary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d As part of that effort, it targeted African-Americans through social media more than any other group.\n\nChairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said the Russian interference campaign hasn\u2019t ended and other adversaries are engaged in similar attacks.\n\n\u201cRussia is waging an information warfare campaign against the U.S. that didn\u2019t start and didn\u2019t end with the 2016 election,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir goal is broader: to sow societal discord and erode public confidence in the machinery of government.\u201d\n\nBurr said Russia floods social media with false reports, conspiracy theories and trolls to breed distrust. \u201cWhile Russia may have been the first to hone the modern disinformation tactics outlined in this report, other adversaries, including China, North Korea, and Iran, are following suit.\u201d\n\nSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, warned of more interference to come in next year\u2019s election. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that bad actors will continue to try to weaponize the scale and reach of social media platforms to erode public confidence and foster chaos,\u201d he said.\n\nTransparency Urged\n\nWarner said Congress should act to require transparency from social media companies and disclosure of political ads online.\n\nThe committee had previously released portions of its analysis. The findings parallel the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions as well as parts of the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAmong the findings were efforts by the Kremlin-directed IRA to convert social media into real-world actions. Operatives posing as U.S. political activists also \u201csought help from the Trump campaign to procure campaign materials and to organize and promote rallies.\u201d\n\nTrump has at times cited Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s assurances that Russia didn\u2019t meddle in the 2016 election, and the president has pursued in recent months a fringe theory that Ukraine conspired with Democrats to trigger an FBI investigation of election meddling that he\u2019s often called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nCommittee Recommendations\n\nAmong the report\u2019s recommendations is for the Trump administration to \u201cpublicly reinforce the danger of attempted foreign interference in the 2020 election.\u201d The committee suggested creating a task force to monitor other nations\u2019 social media interference efforts and develop a framework for deterrence.\n\nThe committee also recommended that social media companies share more information about election interference with each other, as they have with extremist content, as well as providing it to government agencies and researchers. It also called for more publicity about the existence of influence operations.\n\nThe panel urged that lawmakers consider expanding to social media the existing transparency requirements for political advertising on TV or the radio. Facebook, Google and Twitter have all put together ad transparency databases, but differences between them persist and legislative vehicles, such as the \u201cHonest Ads Act\u201d that Warner supports, have stalled.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris, a member of the Intelligence Committee who\u2019s running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in a statement that the Russian tactics were \u201cdesigned to suppress the votes of black Americans in particular\u201d and that social media companies must step up their efforts to fight disinformation. She said they need to \u201censure their workforces are diverse enough to identify and understand the cultural nuances that foreign actors exploit to divide and harm Americans.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Steven T.
