He had a rushed preparation in the summer \u2013 he played against Norwich 11 days after returning from his summer holiday \u2013 but Liverpool's medical staff have been delighted with his rehabilitation.\n\nIt now points to him being ready for a sequence of games in the next four weeks that include collisions with Tottenham and Manchester City in the Premier League, as well a Champions League double-header against Genk.", "description": "The Brazil international has been absent since he tore his calf muscle in the 37th minute of the opening game of the campaign against Norwich, an injury so severe it have left him on crutches.", "authors": ["Dominic King For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/12/19528816-0-Liverpool_goalkeeper_Alisson_is_pushing_for_a_return_from_injury-a-4_1571051554765.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
