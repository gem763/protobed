So Premier Zhou Enlai wrote a letter to the secretary-general of the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese people\u2019s exercise of their own sovereign rights in liberating their own territory,\u201d Zhou wrote, \u201cis entirely a matter of China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d He went on to use that wording, \u201cinternal affairs,\u201d three more times in the letter.\n\nInternal affairs. Across the decades, from Zhou\u2019s relatively ineffectual plea extending to the dramatically different China that exists today, that precise phrase remains an indispensable tool for the Beijing government when challenges - and what it considers bad behavior - arrive from the outside.\n\nWhether it\u2019s foreign complaints about human rights, disputes over the South China Sea or anything about Taiwan or Xinjiang or Tibet and the Dalai Lama, the answer has been remarkably consistent: These are the internal affairs of China - so keep your nose out of them.\n\nFor evidence, just review this past week\u2019s events and the Beijing government\u2019s reactions.\n\nA U.S. basketball team\u2019s general manager supporting Hong Kong protesters with a single tweet from the United States? Interference in China\u2019s internal affairs, with major repercussions for the NBA. Apple hosting an app to help those protesters locate police? Interference in internal affairs.\n\nAn episode of \u201cSouth Park\u201d that skewers Hollywood for cozying up to Beijing? Close enough to interference in internal affairs to get the show scrubbed from the Chinese internet.\n\nAnd U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies that Washington says provide technology to repress minorities in the country\u2019s predominantly Muslim Xinjiang region? No question about that one.\n\n\u201cI must point out that Xinjiang affairs are purely China\u2019s internal affairs that allow no foreign interference,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. \u201cWe urge the U.S. to correct its mistakes at once, withdraw this decision and stop its interference in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nEver since the Opium Wars in the mid-19th century, in which the British forced Qing Dynasty rulers into the opium trade and pried open Chinese ports to Western trade, China\u2019s government has been particularly sensitive to Western doings inside its borders.\n\nBut tension between internal and external in China is far older. The very language it uses for itself and the rest of humanity illustrates that: \u201czhongguo,\u201d or \u201cmiddle country,\u201d for China and \u201cwaiguo,\u201d or \u201coutside country,\u201d for the foreign.\n\nLike any government that controls lots of far-flung land, China, whether run by imperial rulers, Nationalists or the Communist Party, has almost always functioned as a central government trying mightily to maintain control at the edges of a sprawling territory.\n\nIn the U.S., power is balanced carefully between a federal government and the states. In China, the might always comes back to the nucleus of the nucleus - once the emperor inside the Forbidden City, now Xi Jinping and the Communist Party\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee.\n\nAnd in China\u2019s case, watching the farthest reaches of its territory for incursions is a strand of the fundamental, historical DNA.\n\nThis is, after all, a culture that, nearly a millennium ago, was invaded by Mongols who pushed in from its northern edge and formed the Yuan Dynasty, ruling for nearly a century before they collapsed and Han Chinese reclaimed power. The Great Wall, in fact, was built primarily to preserve China\u2019s territorial integrity by keeping more outsiders from invading.\n\nToday, it\u2019s no accident that some of the Beijing government\u2019s most pressing worries are at the flanks of its domestic influence - Xinjiang and Tibet to the far west, Taiwan and now Hong Kong at its southeast edges.\n\nBut as this week\u2019s events underscore, a transformation has been taking place. With its growing influence and international profile, coupled with the rise in technology and the muddying of virtual borders, China\u2019s internal affairs are drifting into more external realms with each passing year.\n\nThe country\u2019s very success in some of its leadership\u2019s priorities - being taken seriously on an international stage and wielding influence worldwide - has placed what was once a relatively inward-focused government onto a global platform.\n\nBy opening up and engaging the world, China extended its reach everywhere. And where reach extends, so, too, has the communist government\u2019s insistence on control. Now the edges of that control have become less defined, because they are no longer entirely geographic or obvious.\n\nFor every step China takes into its vaunted Belt and Road initiative, designed to build global infrastructure and extend influence, it opens itself to more opinions, more disagreements, more potential contentiousness. That\u2019s simply the nature of international engagement.\n\nFor every fresh leap into the internet\u2019s choppy waters (even shielded by its \u201cgreat firewall\u201d) and for every engagement with a Western tech behemoth like Apple, it creates opportunities for outsiders to trip over affairs that it might consider \u201cinternal.\u201d\n\nFor every move that its propaganda operations make toward framing themselves as sleek, independent media on a global stage, it thrusts itself into the marketplace of ideas and invites some of those ideas inside. And for every Confucius Institute it opens to promote Chinese culture and language in another country, it creates conditions for backlash, and for a critical response it may not want.\n\nIn the case of Apple - and, to some extent, the NBA - China\u2019s market muscle may allow it to prevail. In other cases, such as \u201cSouth Park\u201d and, perhaps, Xinjiang, it may find shutting people up to be more difficult.\n\nEither way, China\u2019s internal and external affairs are now so cross-pollinated that the relatively straightforward territorial pleas of a Zhou Enlai in 1955 - about a dispute that is still playing out all these years later - seem almost quaint in their concreteness.\n\nAddressing the NBA brouhaha, an opinion piece in the English-language version of People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s flagship newspaper, took up this issue on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhat are the social taboos, sensitive issues, and political correctness in China?\u201d writer Ren Yi asked. \u201cThey are the integrity of national sovereignty and territory. That is what China values the most.\u201d\n\nBut in an era of blurred boundaries, of basketball leagues and sarcastic foreign TV shows and apps and tweets and the local becoming the global, the question raised this week isn\u2019t going away: Who defines that sovereignty and maps that increasingly virtual territory - China alone, or China along with the world?\n\n___\n\nTed Anthony, who covered China for The Associated Press from 2001 to 2004 and oversaw coverage of it as Asia-Pacific news director from 2014 to 2018, has written about global affairs since 1995.
