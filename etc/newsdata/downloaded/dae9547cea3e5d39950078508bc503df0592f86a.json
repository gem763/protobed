But what\u2019s the response when someone, especially someone with \u201cfact-checker\u201d in his title, just \u2026 gets the fact checks wrong?\n\nBased on research provided to CNN, Col. John \u201cJV\u201d Venable, Heritage\u2019s senior research fellow for defense programs, laid out how the U.S. military was indeed facing a munitions shortage in the waning years of the Obama administration. Venable is a retired Air Force pilot with 25 years of service.\n\nUsing publicly available data from U.S. Central Command and the secretary of the Air Force\u2019s Financial Management website, Venable showed that the joint force dropped more than twice as many precision-guided munitions (PGMs) \u2013 think \u201csmart bombs,\u201d like the JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) \u2013 in just the last three years of the Obama administration than the Air Force could purchase during the full eight years of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure.\n\nWhile Navy numbers were not included in the analysis to CNN, Venable did note that Air Force acquisition of precision-guided munitions dwarfs that of the Navy \u2013 analysis the numbers also showed to be true.\n\nAccording to a 2018 DOD Selective Acquisition Report (SAR), the service purchased a total of 4,485 JDAM guidance kits during the eight years of the Obama presidency. When added to the 45,198 the Air Force purchased during the same years, the joint force collectively acquired 49,963 precision muntions, while it dropped around 96,000 in just the three years preceding Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nNot only was the force dropping far more bombs than it was taking in \u2013 the delay between getting munitions from the checkout line to the flight line was also a compounding factor.\n\n\u201c[I]t takes 2-3 years from purchase order to delivery of these munitions,\u201d Venable wrote to CNN, adding that, \u201cCurrently the Trump administration is rebuilding the PGM stockpile by purchasing as many munitions as current production capacity allows.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line, he wrote, \u201cis that the Obama administration effectively gutted the munitions stockpile.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s leadership has reversed that trend markedly, however.\n\n\u201cBy the end of fiscal year 2020, the Trump administration will have acquired more than four times the number of GPS-guided munitions than were acquired during the eight years of the Obama administration\u2013years when expenditures [munitions dropped] were very high,\u201d Venable told CNN.\n\nAt current rates for the Air Force, the total will come to more than 192,000 munitions by next October.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming: the U.S. military was facing a dwindling precision munitions stockpile as Obama left the White House, and, all bluster aside, Trump has begun to erase it.\n\nUnfortunately, CNN\u2019s piece, which should have evaluated those very numbers, included none of them. Instead, the piece (\u201cFact check: Trump exaggerates on munitions shortage\u201d) found Trump\u2019s claim to be \u201ca severe exaggeration.\u201d\n\nDespite having Venable\u2019s analysis in hand, the author, Daniel Dale, wrote: \u201cIt has never been clear how dire or how unusual the perceived shortage was, since the military does not release comprehensive data about ammunition levels.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why such important details, which should have markedly changed the outcome of the fact check itself, were omitted, the fact-checker replied: \u201cI very much do not think that JV\u2019s data \u2026 was itself even remotely close to assess the extent of the shortage.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, the piece used vague, data-less commentary from other analysts downplaying any possible munitions shortage, while omitting the numbers-based data from Venable that showed Trump\u2019s comments may have been correct.\n\nHe also claimed the numbers irrelevant to the \u201cmilitary\u2019s concern\u201d about specific \u201cpossible contingencies.\u201d\n\nYet, Venable wrote in his analysis: \u201cEstimates for the monthly expenditure of munitions in a war with China or Russia dwarf the 5,000 PGM munitions/month the U.S. endured at the height of the GWOT [Global War on Terror].\u201d\n\nIn other words, the shortage was even more drastic, not less, if tied to a specific conflict with Russia, China, North Korea, or Iran, because the military would need even more munitions to successfully engage in such a conflict.\n\nWhat this instance illustrates is the importance of unbiased fact-checking, and a pursuit of narrative based on the facts, not the other way around.\n\nI have worked with a wide variety of reporters for nearly a decade, and let me tell you \u2013 it\u2019s not mere lip-service to say that the overwhelming majority, whether official \u201cfact-checkers\u201d or not, take their responsibility to uncover and report the truth seriously.\n\nAnd, they do this despite what some at the highest levels of government today might say.\n\nHowever, sometimes individuals get the story wrong. When that happens, those involved in helping tell it should correct the record, especially about a topic as vital as the strength of our military.\n\nIndeed, downplaying this facet of the readiness crisis serves only to hurt the military most of all. If the public is not aware of the military\u2019s needs, how can they be expected to support the actions necessary to meet those needs?\n\nUltimately, it is critical that those tasked with evaluating statements of fact do everything in their power to take all the evidence into account before making statements of fact of their own.\n\nThat is the right standard for all of us.", "description": "CNN\u2019s fact-checking unit reached out last week to The Heritage Foundation for analysis of President Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments about the U.S. military\u2019s munitions stockpile at the time he took office.\n\nBewilderingly, the fact-checker for the cable news pioneer then ignored those facts.", "authors": ["John Cooper", "Defense Foreign Policy", "John Cooper Is Senior Communications Manager For The Heritage Foundation S Davis Institute For National Security", "Foreign Policy."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-458619967.jpg?itok=M7DwEO_P", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
