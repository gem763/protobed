We asked an astrophysicist", "language": "en", "text": "Astrophysicist explains some theories for why we\u2019ve never made contact with aliens\n\nAccording to NASA, the chance that we\u2019re alone in the universe is less than one in ten billion trillion.\n\nOK \u2060\u2014 we know math can be hard.\n\nThat basically means that it\u2019s more likely that aliens exist than not.\n\nSo where are they?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that astronomers have been asking for years, most famously Enrico Fermi.\n\nHe noticed that there were billions of planets in our galaxy capable of supporting life and that intelligent life should be able to colonize the galaxy pretty quickly.\n\nYet we\u2019ve never seen aliens.\n\nScientists estimate that there are roughly 60 billion planets in our galaxy that could support life. (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThis contradiction is called the Fermi paradox.\n\nFor years, scientists have tried to come up with some explanations for this conundrum.\n\nCBC Kids News contributor Mateus Soto spoke with astrophysicist Ilana MacDonald about some of these explanations.\n\nE.T., pick up the phone!\n\nEven if there\u2019s a ton of microbial life out there, it\u2019s possible that none of it has evolved to the point where it can communicate.\n\nMacDonald says that \u201cmaybe there is no other intelligent life in the universe.\u201d\n\nOr it could just be a communication issue.\n\nAccording to MacDonald, it\u2019s possible that aliens know we exist and are just screening our calls. (Philip Street/CBC)\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re not interested in talking to us \u2026 they don\u2019t feel like they want to be found,\u201d said MacDonald.\n\nThe sting of rejection hurts, right?\n\nTiming is everything\n\nA more comforting option is that our calls just haven\u2019t been received \u2026 yet, said Macdonald.\n\n\u201cWe [could be] right at the beginning of intelligent life arising in the universe and other civilizations are at the same point we are \u2026 their radio signals just haven\u2019t had time to reach [us].\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that civilizations just don\u2019t last long enough to make it to other planets.\n\nMacDonald suggests that things like war, natural disasters or even artificial intelligence could prevent civilizations from lasting very long.\u2019 (Philip Street/CBC).\n\n\u201cMaybe a civilization only lasts thousands of years. Their radio signals went by us, our civilization arose and we never had a chance to hear from them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that we just don\u2019t speak alien.\n\n\u201cThey could have found a whole new way of communicating that we haven\u2019t thought of, and if we could tune into it, we\u2019d be part of a conversation that we\u2019ve been missing out on for thousands of years,\u201d said MacDonald.\n\nFor more interesting space facts, check out parts 1 and 2 of our series on space.", "description": "CBC News contributor Mateus Soto speaks with an astrophysicist about the Fermi paradox and why we haven\u2019t seen alien life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/Space3_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
