The doctor ran a blood test, it showed J.T. had lower levels of iron and hemoglobin -- a blood cell count -- than a typical baby at his age.\n\nThey later discovered that J.T. had a type of anemia, which is a shortage of red blood cells.\n\nUPMC Childrens Hospital\n\nThe Borofkas were referred to another hospital. While there, his parents said J.T.\u2019s hemoglobin blood cell level dropped so much that he needed an emergency blood transfusion.\n\n\u201cAt that point, we knew something was really wrong,\u201d Jason Borofka said.\n\nJ.T. was then diagnosed with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, or TPI. It's a rare, inherited gene mutation that causes the deficiency of triosephosphate -- an enzyme-- and leads to the anemia. Doctors only give him two to five more years to live if untreated. But since there is no cure for the disease, even with supportive medical treatments, kids with TPI don\u2019t typically live beyond childhood.\n\nThat\u2019s likely because it is extremely rare. So rare, that there are less than 70 cases of it in the world, according to estimates from a doctor who studies TPI.\n\n\u201cHave you ever Googled something and only one page of Google is there?\u201d asked Tara Borofka. \u201cThat\u2019s how rare the disease is.\u201d\n\nThe symptoms include muscle loss, muscle wasting and irreversible brain damage. Jason Borofka said the panic of searching and looking for help was driving them to the edge.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, it definitely felt like our world was crumbling,\u201d Tara Borofka said. \u201cThere was no hope.\u201d\n\nThere is believed to be only one doctor who studies TPI. The Borofkas, with the help of Stanford Children\u2019s Health, found him.\n\nAnd this is where the hope comes in.\n\nDr. Michael Palladino studies metabolic diseases, including TPI deficiency.\n\nUPMC Childrens Hospital\n\nPalladino has been studying it for 16 years. During that time, he said he\u2019s been contacted every 12 to 18 months by parents or a clinician. His patients hail from France, Russia and Italy.\n\nAnd now, a couple from California.\n\nBecause the disease currently lacks a treatment, they don\u2019t have access to anything preventive or curative. One patient, like J.T., is on a diet change. It isn\u2019t proven that it works, but the families understandably want to try anything they can.\n\n\u201cKids are dying a horrible death of this disease and someone should be studying it,\u201d Palladino said. \u201cBiotech companies aren\u2019t going to pursue it. There\u2019s no profit to be had in it. So it seems like a good thing for an academic to study.\u201d\n\nUPMC Childrens Hospital\n\nThe Borofkas exchanged texts, calls and emails with Palladino. They even traveled to meet him at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh.\n\nNow, the clock is on to fund research that could save J.T.\u2019s life. The Borofkas are aggressively fundraising so Palladino can hopefully find a cure. Their goal is to raise about $1.2 million. They have raised about $200,000 so far. They have events scheduled through November to try and reach this goal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one event after another,\u201d Tara Borofka said. \u201cWe have hockey tournaments coming, bowling tournaments coming, a barn dance coming, paint nights coming.\u201d\n\nThey even started a clothing line in honor of J.T. Jason Borofka said they sold more than $10,000 worth of clothes to people all around the country.\n\n\u201cAll of that is going right back to [Palladino's] lab,\" Jason Borofka said. \"As much as we can possibly fund and funnel it back here because right now, we truly believe this is our best shot.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no happy ending yet. But there is something else.\n\n\u201cWhen we discovered that Michael Palladino could find a treatment and could discover something, you go from being down here to like, \u2018Yay!\u2019 you know? It gives us hope,\" Tara Borofka said.", "description": "Jason and Tara Borofka's 1-year-old son J.T. has a rare form of anemia.
