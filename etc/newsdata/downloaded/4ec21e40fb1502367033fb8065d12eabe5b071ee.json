These same complaints were \u201ccooking\u201d \u2014 but without realization or even awareness \u2014 for the traditional Washington \u201cestablishments,\u201d including the media, Congress, the DNC and, perhaps surprisingly, the RNC.\n\nAnd recall how few in \u201cclueless\u201d Washington took Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 run seriously. However, they learned \u2014 just like Hillary learned \u2014 that Mr. Trump was elected because working middle America had too long been taken for granted by establishment Washington. This in favor of endless wars and ever-enlarging welfare programs \u2014 while ignoring the basic principle of \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also had the audacity to criticize the Washington political establishment, i.e., to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d and thereby criticize Congress. This included [and still includes] both Republicans and Democrats who had supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003, based on very bad intelligence that Saddam had \u201cWMD,\u201d including a viable nuclear weapons program. The Iraq war cost us $7 trillon to $10 trillion of mostly borrowed money, depending what/how one counts. And in this respect, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms included both Republicans and Democrats in Congress who \u201cdo what Congress does\u201d \u2014 simply by spending trillions of \u201cother people\u2019s money.\u201d\n\nSo, in 2016, Mr. Trump basically took advantage of the ever-decreasing popularity of Congress \u2014 now even lower than ever \u2014 and he continues to beat on them. Congress has never seen anything like it \u2014 and they hate it while most Americans love it. In fact, Congress is just now figuring out that most Americans think they are useless.\n\nThen, and mostly because of Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the 2003 Iraq war, 122 so-called \u201cmembers of the Republican national security community\u201d \u2014 including both former George W. Bush administration appointees and \u201cdeep state\u201d Iraq War advocates \u2014 put out a vitriolic personal attack of Mr. Trump in March 2016. The attack includied the statement that Mr. Trump was \u201cfundamentally dishonest.\u201d When this so-called \u201cOpen Letter on Donald Trump from GOP National Security Leaders\u201d was released, many signers had obviously decided that there was no way Mr. Trump would ever be the Republican nominee, let alone elected president.\n\nNo doubt what motivated them was that signing such a personal attack against Mr. Trump would ensure their selection for \u201cbig jobs\u201d in a Jeb Bush administration, who they thought would win the election. Wrong. And as it turned out, these 122 so-called \u201cmembers of the Republican national security community\u201d succeeded only in dumping on themselves.\n\nA few of these \u201cdeep state\u201d signers have tried to \u201cwalk back\u201d from the insulting \u201copen letter\u201d they signed \u2014 however, how could any of them expect to be appointed in any capacity in a Trump administration? And, for that matter, how could any of them be capable of objectivity in anything they say or write about national security? In short, signing the \u201copen letter\u201d was the epitome of poor judgment on their part and has rendered them mostly irrelevant.\n\nNext, we can\u2019t forget what Mr. Trump followed: The Obama administration played the media \u201clike an organ\u201d for eight years, this while regarding them as \u201csnot-nosed kids,\u201d as the saying goes. Specifically, it was Obama NSC Official Ben Rhodes \u2014 brother of then-CBS News CEO \u2014 who described Washington media as \u201c27-year-old know nothings\u201d working in an \u201cecho chamber.\u201d This essentially allows the media to write/say virtually anything \u2014 so long as it\u2019s preceded by \u201cit\u2019s been reported that.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line here is that Donald Trump has basically \u201cundone\u201d the entire media structure in the United States and they hate him for it \u2014 they can\u2019t hide their contempt for him and no longer even try. Because of Donald Trump, our media has virtually no political credibility \u2014 and this explains why they mostly interview each other these days.\n\nWhat conclusions can we draw from these dynamics?\n\n\u2022 Despite being clubbed around by the political realities Donald Trump has brought to town, Washington institutions \u2014 including Congress, the media and both national political parties \u2014 remain largely clueless about the fundamental changes Mr. Trump has made in our political system. He brought the \u201ctweet\u201d to D.C. and has forever changed the way the town makes news.\n\n\u2022 Democrats have mostly focused their time and energy opposing whatever Mr. Trump wants to do \u2014 even if it\u2019s the same kind of program [border security, for example] that Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton aggressively advocated.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s also clear that Democrats will do most anything \u2014 even if it\u2019s destructive of our fundamental American values \u2014 to oppose the continued success of the Trump agenda. This includes \u201ctanking\u201d the economy if they can.\n\n\u2022 Also, much of \u201ctraditional Washington\u201d wants Mr. Trump to fail, even if it takes us with him. This is the same reason the 2020 election may well be our last real chance to preserve our unique and autonomous system of limited government.\n\nBottom line: Washington had become way too full of itself and Donald Trump let the gas out of bloated institutional egos here \u2014 and, of course, they don\u2019t like him for it.\n\nBig surprise.\n\n\u2022 Daniel Gallington served in senior national security and intelligence policy positions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Department of Justice and as General Counsel for the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
