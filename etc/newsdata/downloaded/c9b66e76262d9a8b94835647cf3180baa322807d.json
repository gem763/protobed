I called my phone and they answered. We actually had a pleasant chat where I congratulated them on being the new owners of a Coach purse, $200 cash and my phone. Asked that they simply mail my driver\u2019s license back. They did. Lol \u2014 Rhonda (@Look_its_Rhonda) October 14, 2019\n\n3.\n\nFound car keys once. They had a tag from a cemetery in a different state. Called the cemetery and they gave me a last name. Did some sleuthing on the last name and found a local address.

She was so relieved it hadn't been taken. Made my day to save hers. \u2014 ZeldaToYourLink (@ZeldaToYourLink) October 15, 2019\n\n6.\n\nI was working as a high school teacher and lost CASH and more importantly a receipt I needed to be reimbursed by the school district.. a 15 year old boy TURNED IT IN TO THE OFFICE.

So, it's not just about losing money, it's also about having to replenish all those documents.\n\nIt is heartwarming to know that someone cared enough to make so much effort to give Tim his wallet back.
