But at this point it should be clear to those not wholly invested in \u201cBrexit at any cost\u201d that preventing another Johnson-led government should be a top priority.\n\nJohnson cannot be allowed to gain a majority in the Commons, where he has so far been defeated at every opportunity by MPs voting with their consciences. But the danger is great. The Tories are still winning in the polls, and though the same was true in 2017 when May\u2019s majority evaporated, a large proportion of the Labour vote has since been driven towards the Liberal Democrats.\n\nWith a divided opposition and the chances of an electoral pact almost certainly nil, it falls to the electorate to vote with our heads as well as our hearts.\n\nNow, I am not a Labour member. Despite my natural inclination towards the party, I\u2019ve never voted for Labour in my life. While I was a student in the 2015 and 2017 general elections, I voted for the Liberal Democrats \u2013 unlike many of my friends, who were appalled that I could vote for a party which had enabled some of the most damaging Conservative policies this country has ever seen.\n\nI couldn\u2019t argue the last point. But the fact remains that Oxford West and Abingdon was won by the Liberal Democrats from the Conservatives with a margin of 1.4 points, and a majority of 816. Every vote for the Labour candidate, who came third with 12.6 per cent of the vote, was effectively shrinking that margin.\n\nNow, four years later, I\u2019m in the enviable position my friends were in: of voting with my heart. Battersea is another marginal seat \u2013 but this time it\u2019s split between Conservative and Labour. Marsha De Cordova has a majority of just 4.4 points, and the Liberal Democrats are in third place with 8 per cent of the vote. The chances of a Lib Dem victory are slim to none, but every vote they gain is a vote which Labour has lost, and the Conservatives have effectively won.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that our first-past-the-post electoral system requires tactical voting. But it would be even more unfortunate to usher Johnson back into No10, this time for five years; potentially with a far larger majority. Preventing this will require sacrifice, a sacrifice that opposition parties are unwilling to make for the benefit of the country.
