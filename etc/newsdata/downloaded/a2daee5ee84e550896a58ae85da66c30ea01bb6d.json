President of the National Fisheries Institute John Connelly said:\n\n\u201cAs one of the most traded commodities in the world, seafood has a complex and wide-reaching supply chain, which makes testing and further developing technology-assisted traceability programs an important step. It is encouraging to see a retail leader like Walmart participate in seafood blockchain testing.\u201d\n\nWalmart worked with the Indian seafood processor Sandhya Aqua to add the shrimp supply chain to the blockchain-enabled IBM Food Trust platform so customers can track where their shrimp comes from.\n\nShrimp is India\u2019s largest agricultural export, with the U.S. representing its largest shrimp market, consuming 46% of India\u2019s shrimp exports. LiveMint reports that the application blockchain technology will help Indian shrimp farmers meet strict U.S. food standards, thus gaining the trust of U.S. retailers and securing shrimp farming as a long-term growth industry.\n\nWalmart has previously applied blockchain technology to tracking food in other countries like China. Distributed ledger technologies like blockchain purportedly make it easier for the firm to track its massive supply chains and to recall problematic food items or medicines should the need arise.\n\nBuilding on the IBM Food Trust platform\n\nCointelegraph reported in September that a group of global coffee companies is partnering with Farmer Connect, a tech startup developing farm-to-client traceability tools, to use the IBM Food Trust platform to apply blockchain to coffee supply chain tracking. The startup worked with IBM to build the \u201cThank My Farmer\u201d app, which provides consumers with data about coffee products, which include origin and pricing.", "description": "United States retail giant Walmart will use blockchain technology to track its Indian-sourced shrimp", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNDdkNThkOTU0OTBiOTNiMmYxZDFlYWEwZmFlY2ZhZWYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
