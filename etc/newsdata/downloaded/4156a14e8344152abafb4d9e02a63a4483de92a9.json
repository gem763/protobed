If you are, isn\u2019t that a bad thing that election authorities ought to fix? In a country where roughly 35 million people move each year, do we want lots of people registered to vote in two different places? If one election authority doesn\u2019t check with another election authority, doesn\u2019t that open the door to people voting twice in the same election in different jurisdictions? Put aside whether it ever happens frequently enough to swing an election \u2014 and recall that Virginia state legislative election came down to a tie back in 2017 \u2014 don\u2019t election authorities have a duty to make sure that people aren\u2019t registered to vote in two different locations?\n\nThe first sentence of a Atlanta Journal-Constitution article creating a stir about so-called voter suppression: \u201cAbout 330,000 voter registrations in Georgia could soon be canceled because registrants haven\u2019t participated in elections for several years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDown in the 26th paragraph, the last one in the story: \u201cThat means for most of the 330,000 Georgia voters who could be canceled, the last time they voted or registered to vote was at least six years ago. Voters who participated in elections more recently could also be canceled if mail from county election offices was returned as undeliverable.\u201d\n\nIs the state being unreasonable or unfair by expecting those who have not voted in six years to affirm that they\u2019re still living at their address and want to stay registered?\n\nCases of people voting twice are not common, but they happen:\n\nNorth Carolina: \u201cA Haywood County man has been sentenced to probation and community service for voting twice in the March 2016 primary election.\u201d\n\nIowa: \u201cAn Iowa woman charged with voting twice for Donald Trump last fall has pleaded guilty to election misconduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York: \u201cSpiro Colaitis, 57, of Manhasset, New York, was arrested and charged Friday with casting more than one ballot in an election.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Foundation tracks cases and convictions of voter fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorgia has provisional ballot laws that allow people to vote and straighten out any confusion about where they\u2019re registered after Election Day. Georgia even gives voters who show up in the wrong precinct \u201cpartial credit\u201d of sorts: \u201cIf you were eligible to vote but voted in the wrong precinct, only the votes for candidates for which you were entitled to vote will be counted, and you will be notified in writing that your ballot was partially counted for your correct precinct.\u201d Let\u2019s say you moved from one congressional district to another but didn\u2019t update your voter registration. They would count your ballot for the statewide races, but not the congressional one.\n\nIt will probably not surprise you that Stacey Abrams\u2019 organization objects to the move. What are we to think when one party objects, so regularly and angrily, to actions as mundane as sending a notice to those who haven\u2019t voted in six years?\n\nAnother One of Those Left-Wing Deep State Wounded Veteran Army Trump Staffers\n\nI know, I know, this must be another left-wing deep state bureaucrat who could only be motivated by personal animosity to the president; it couldn\u2019t possibly be that he genuinely believes that the United States government is not supposed to communicate a request to a foreign government to announce an investigation of a potential rival candidate through the president\u2019s personal lawyer. Or so we\u2019re likely to be told by the usual suspects:\n\nLt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman of the Army, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, twice registered internal objections about how Mr. Trump and his inner circle were treating Ukraine, out of what he called a \u201csense of duty,\u201d he plans to tell the inquiry, according to a draft of his opening statement obtained by The New York Times. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Colonel Vindman said in his statement. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d The colonel, a Ukrainian-American immigrant who received a Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq by a roadside bomb and whose statement is full of references to duty and patriotism, could be a more difficult witness to dismiss than his civilian counterparts. Vindman plans to say that he is not the whistle-blower who initially reported Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine.\n\nFor everyone who will contend that Vindman is another left-wing deep state bureaucrat, just as they contend the same label applies to acting Ukraine ambassador Bill Taylor, the question will remain why the Trump White House and administration keeps getting staffed by so many left-wing deep state bureaucrats in key positions. Even if you buy into the narrative that all of these objecting officials are the villains in this story, that narrative means this president is constantly hiring and appointing the worst possible people for the job. (Then again, Omarosa, Michael Cohen, Anthony Scaramucci . . . maybe that is the most plausible defense. Of course, the argument, \u201cit\u2019s not the president\u2019s fault, he keeps hiring the worst person for the job\u201d is not really the most compelling defense of this administration.)\n\nPelosi: Fine, Fine, We\u2019ll Have an on-the-record Vote and Start Public Hearings\n\nClearly, Thursday\u2019s Morning Jolt was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. If you\u2019re going to hold an impeachment, you want to vote to formally start it, and you\u2019re going to want to start the public part as quickly as possible.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi added to that sense of urgency, announcing that after weeks of private fact-finding, the full House would vote on Thursday to initiate a public phase of the inquiry. That vote would establish rules for the public presentation of evidence and outline due process rights for Mr. Trump. It will be the first time all House lawmakers will be asked to go on record on the investigation since it began in September, something Democrats had so far resisted.\n\nDemocrats say they have the votes to formally begin the inquiry, and based upon public statements, they have the votes. But for a nervous Democrat in a swing district, there\u2019s a little wiggle room between publicly saying you\u2019ll support an impeachment effort and actually voting for it.\n\nADDENDUM: Gail Collins, inadvertently summarizing how a lot of Democrats see the world during Trump\u2019s presidency: \u201cTruly the bottom line rule of this administration is that no news is ever going to be really good. DJT will always find a way to make it awful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what separates those of us deeply frustrated with Trump from those who have full-blown Trump Derangement Syndrome. When you cannot take any satisfaction, joy, or other positive feelings in a dead ISIS leader, the end of the Islamic State, low unemployment, a booming stock market, criminal justice reform, Right to Try, or any other development in any realm of social policy, economic policy, or foreign policy, then we are no longer discussing a particular presidency but what criteria you use to see the world. Your lens is permanently darkened and cannot let in light, no matter how brightly it shines. The continued presence of a president you deeply dislike ruins everything for you, and that says a great deal more about you than him.", "description": "When should a voter be removed from the rolls in the United States?", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Andrew C.
