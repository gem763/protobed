The FSA evolved increasingly strict requirements for license applicants in the wake of a major $532 million hack in January 2018 of local exchange Coincheck.\n\nCoincheck went on to secure an FSA license in January of this year. Other regulator-approved exchanges include LVC Corporation \u2014 the digital asset- and blockchain-focused arm of Japanese messaging giant LINE \u2014 which was granted a license this September.\n\nFounded in China in 2013, Huobi Group has been headquartered in Singapore since Beijing\u2019s crackdown on domestic crypto-fiat exchanges in September 2017.\n\nThis August, New York-based blockchain infrastructure firm Elementus published research alleging that almost 50% of the total number of PlusToken withdrawals \u2014 an alleged crypto Ponzi scheme \u2014 were processed via the flagship Huobi platform.", "description": "FSA-licensed crypto exchange Huobi Japan has raised $4.6 million from Financial Products Group, a financial instruments business operator", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNWFkYWFhMDdkNGVhM2MwN2IzZTYxYTI3MWNmNzM2MDQuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
