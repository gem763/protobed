The suspect has since been deported, Ayob said.\n\nMalaysia has arrested hundreds of people in the past few years for suspected militant links.", "description": "Malaysia has arrested 15 people, mostly foreigners from neighboring Indonesia, on suspicion of having links with the Islamic State militant group, police said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
