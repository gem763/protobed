That comes nearly two months after the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee went ahead with its first cut in 11 years.\n\nMajor U.S. stock exchanges dropped after the decision was announced.\n\nIn addition to the reduction, the Fed cut the interest it pays on excess reserves by 30 basis points, greater than the funds rate cut, amid a breakdown this week in the overnight repurchase lending market. The move was aimed at keeping the funds rate within its target range; the interest on excessive reserves (IOER) historically has acted as a guardrail for the funds rate, which traded 5 basis points above the target.\n\nWhile the committee as a whole has not pointed to further cuts, divisions remain among individual policymakers. Three Fed regional presidents \u2014 Esther George of Kansas City, Eric Rosengren of Boston and James Bullard of St. Louis \u2014 each voted no. George and Rosengren have said they prefer to keep the funds rate steady while Bullard has advocated for a 50 basis point cut.\n\nThat was the most dissents for a Fed decision since December 2014.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has called Fed policymakers \"boneheads\" for not cutting rates enough, tore into Wednesday's decision, saying Chairman Jay Powell and his colleagues have \"no 'guts.'\" Trump says the Fed is risking U.S. competitiveness by keeping rates substantially higher than most of the rest of the developed world.", "description": "Investors largely expected the FOMC to cut rates by a quarter point.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106136911-1568832308031ap_19261669186913.jpg?v=1568832371", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
