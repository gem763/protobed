Photo: Stella Blackmon/New York Magazine\n\nHardcover or soft? Leather or cloth? Spiral-bound or sewn? Are the pages gridded? Are they a comfortable writing size? Do they tear out easily? Whether you use your notebook mainly for jotting, reporting, journaling, list-making \u2014 or some Beautiful Mind\u2013esque combination of all of the above \u2014 the details really matter. And there are so many to consider. Finding the best options can be an obsessive quest \u2014 and thus one we couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nIn the same way we went about ranking 100 pens, we started by digging through our own archive of notebook coverage, consulted dozens of experts, and gathered up our personal favorites to determine the top competitors. Then we called in notebooks of all kinds, including bullet journals, composition books, waterproof reporter pads, and a few exciting additions from around the world \u2014 places like Portugal, Japan, even Bulgaria \u2014 and put them to the test. The resulting list is a ranking of the top 100 notebooks, according to Strategist editors and writers. And if you agree or disagree (or have a favorite we missed), let us know in the comments \u2014 we just might test your favorite when we update this list in the future.\n\nCriteria\n\nAmong our team members, we have those who prefer lined notebooks, others who like blank ones; we have our spiral diehards and bullet-journal enthusiasts. And while individual preferences may vary, we\u2019ve aimed to standardize our judgments by evaluating each notebook on a scale of 1 (poor) through 5 (excellent) in the following categories:\n\nDesign: Is there enough room to write? Do the aesthetics and ergonomics of the open notebook encourage you to use it? Do the lines/dots/grid feel impactful in a good way or overly designed and distracting? Or are they, in fact, perfectly muted?\n\nPage Quality: Is the paper smooth enough for writing? Is it thin or thick? Does the weight of the page make it feel luxurious or flimsy? Is the texture soft and smooth or coarse and scratchy? Is the paper recycled/recycled-feeling? Colored or unbleached or bleached bright white? Does the ink bleed through?\n\nOverall Feel: Does the notebook feel substantial or flimsy? Is it a good weight and size? How portable is it? Does it pack easily into certain bags? Will it hold up against wear and tear? Are there too many/too few pages? Or is it just right?\n\nThe Cover: What design elements stand out? Is it hardcover or softcover? Is it nice to look at or jarring? Is it minimal, classic, and clean or just boring? Design-y in a cool way? Or is it overdone or even a little immature-looking? Does it come off as expensive or cheap?\n\nMethodology\n\nOnce we had our notebooks in hand, we divvied them up among our 13 writers and editors to be rated according to our criteria. We asked our team members to use their favorite pen for each notebook to have a control factor. And since personal tastes vary \u2014 some of us prefer lined paper, others dotted or blank \u2014 we each stuck to judging the type of notebook we tend to use anyway.\n\nEach tester used a single notebook for at least one full day for all writing needs (brainstorming, note-taking, journaling, list-making). And to get a real feel for the experience of actually living with the thing \u2014 carrying it around and stowing it in a bag \u2014 we all brought our test notebooks to meetings and on our commutes. Here, top 100 notebooks, ranked in order. Click here to jump to the top 80, top 60, top 40, or top 20.\n\n1. Public Supply Soft Cover Notebook\n\nType: Dot or lined Design: 5 | Page Quality: 4.9 | Overall feel: 5 | The Cover: 5 I\u2019m a devoted Muji Paper Bind user (see below), but this notebook from Public Supply came out a little further ahead for a few reasons: First, Public Supply donates a portion of every sale to public-school classrooms throughout the U.S. It also comes in a ton of vibrant colors and special editions. As for the notebooks themselves, the pages are a nice eggshell color and easy on the eyes, which I prefer to bright-white pages (my only gripe is that they\u2019re somewhat narrow). The dot grid is super-subtle, so it helps line things up without taking over. And the surface of the paper is slick, which means ink won\u2019t bleed, and the paper is FSC certified, meaning it\u2019s sourced from responsibly managed forests. \u2014Liza Corsillo Total score: 4.975 $16 at Juniper & Scout Buy $16 at Public Supply Buy\n\n2. Muji Paper Bind Notebook A6\n\nType: Blank Design: 4.8 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 5 | The Cover: 5 This is the notebook I use on a regular basis for writing to-do lists, drawing on the subway, recording my feelings, and jotting down ideas. I am extremely attracted to the no-nonsense design and construction of these \u2014 and the price. I buy them in bulk so I won\u2019t run out and so I can line them up on a shelf in my apartment when they\u2019re full. The pages are smooth and creamy. They fit inside nearly every bag or purse I own, and their weight is imperceptible. I like that they\u2019re slim and bendable \u2014 I can slip one inside the pocket of a hoodie \u2014 and since they\u2019re not overly precious, I don\u2019t have to think twice about filling them up with random musings. Larger, fancier notebooks can make me worry that what I\u2019m writing isn\u2019t good enough for their pristine pages. And though I love a beautiful linen or leather cover, I like that this Muji notebook has a card-stock paper cover so I can draw on it or label it with dates and project names. In my opinion, this notebook has only two design flaws. One is that the pages are slightly transparent when used with inkier pens, and the other is that they don\u2019t lie open on their own. But with a little encouragement, I can bend one to my will so it\u2019ll stay flat.\n\n\u2014LC Total score: 4.95 $10 for 5 at Amazon Buy $10 for 5 at Amazon Buy\n\n3. Appointed Dot Grid Workbook\n\nType: Dot grid Design: 4.75 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 5 | The Cover: 5 I typically use lined or blank pages with a stitched (not spiral) binding, but this dotted spiral notebook made me reconsider everything I ever thought I wanted in a notebook. It was my favorite of the ones I tested for its lovely textured cover, for the way the cover flips back over the brass-colored spiral, and for the faint dots inside, which I found even more enjoyable to write on than lined paper (!). It\u2019s simultaneously stately and accessible, and using it makes me feel productive. The pages are smooth but not too smooth, thick but not too thick, and don\u2019t bleed through. My one complaint, and the thing that kept me from giving this a perfect score, was that the dotted rows are just a tiny bit too close together for my taste. They\u2019re faint enough that you can write outside them without it looking sloppy, but ideally I\u2019d like my writing to fit between the lines. \u2014Hilary Reid Total score: 4.93 $24 at Need Supply Co.

Zhi Jin Classic Thick Cloth Linen Notebook\n\nType: Blank Design: 5 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 5 | The Cover: 4.5 This was a lovely notebook and one that I would leave out on my desk to admire. It has a pretty linen cover, with cream endpapers inside, and has that special feeling of a really well-made minimalist object. The texture of the pages almost grips the tip of your pen when you write, which might sound annoying but is actually very satisfying. \u2014HR\ufeff Total score: 4.875 $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\n5. Livework Moment Leather Blank Journal\n\nType: Blank Design: 5 | Page Quality: 4.5 | Overall feel: 5 | The Cover: 5 Aside from its extremely handsome looks, I can write extremely well in this notebook. The smooth pages allow my pen to effortlessly glide across. I love that the paper has an off-white coloring, which is easier on my eyes under our office\u2019s fluorescent lights. And though its bound, it acts like a spiral in that it stays open with no page creasing, and I can write on the front and back with ease. The lineless pages give me plenty of room to write, too. \u2014Chloe Anello Total score: 4.875 $33 at Fallindesign Buy $32 at Mochithings Buy\n\n6. Milligram Blank Linen Notebook\n\nType: Blank $24 (was $28, now 14% off) Design: 5 | Page Quality: 4.8 | Overall feel: 4.5 | The Cover: 5 The look of this notebook is very pleasing \u2014 warm yet neutral cloth-bound cover, peachy endpapers, back pocket, and small embossed details on the cover. Honestly, it\u2019s worthy of an Instagram photo shoot of its own. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s a favorite among prop stylists. That said, I don\u2019t love the color of the pages \u2014 too bright for my eyes. And it\u2019s not very portable, sadly. But as a thing on my desk to give other people the impression that I have my shit together: Aces. \u2014LC Total score: 4.825 $24 at Milligram Buy\n\n7. Kokuyo Campus Notebook A5\n\nType: Gridded Design: 4.5 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 4.8 | The Cover: 4.8 I love the size and shape of this notebook. The pages are super-slick \u2014 kind of like bristol board but thinner \u2014 so my pen kind of glides across the page. I also really like how this notebook packs a ton of pages into a relatively thin book. Its grid pattern is unobtrusive, and each page has a faint little date area in the top right corner. The cover of the notebook has a cool \u201980s-looking font and design, which for me brought a little too much personality to the table, but for others it might be just enough. \u2014LC Total score: 4.775 $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\n8. Rollbahn Pocket Memo Notebook\n\nType: Gridded Design: 4.75 | Page Quality: 4.75 | Overall feel: 4.75 | The Cover: 4.75 I am a lifelong ruled-notebook person. But this gridded notebook turned out to be my favorite \u2014 and the one I returned to following our tests. It\u2019s simple but elegant, without overly complicated sections or chirpy to-do boxes. It\u2019s just a wealth of gridded pages on creamy paper of a soft, Post-it Notes yellow. The medium-size spiral-bound spine is substantial but not overwhelming. Something I will likely never use are the five plastic pocket sleeves in the back, which you could save little things in if you wanted to. The size is ideal: spacious enough to include a packed day\u2019s schedule but dense enough to last about two semesters or quarters. \u2014Simone Kitchens Total score: 4.75 $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\n9. Midori MD Notebook Light\n\nType: Blank, lined, or gridded Design: 4.5 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 4.5 | The Cover: 5 There is a lot to love about the Midori MD Notebook: It has an understated design, is super-portable, and has a reasonable price point, to boot. It\u2019s really the details that make this notebook shine \u2014 the little red ribbon bookmark, the elegant embossed logo on the cover \u2014 and the dimensions are subtle but elevate the whole thing. It\u2019s available in three formats: blank, lined, and gridded, so it\u2019s sure to please most stationery aficionados. And while I was initially worried about the card-stock cover\u2019s durability, I found that Midori sells a line of covers in either goat leather or C\u00f3rdoba paper to keep the notebook protected. I tested a muted-pink C\u00f3rdoba paper cover, which I ended up liking almost as much the notebook itself. \u2014Dominique Pariso Total score: 4.75 $11 for 3 at Amazon Buy $11 for 3 at Amazon Buy\n\n10. Moleskine Volant Journal\n\nType: Lined Design: 5 | Page Quality: 4.5 | Overall feel: 4.5 | The Cover: 4.7 Though I am a graph person at heart, this little guy is my platonic ideal of a ruler-lined notebook. It is the perfect size for a bag (five-by-eight-inch), has 96 pages (plenty, but not an intimidating number), and the cover colors are pretty and have no decorative elements or text anywhere to be found. The front and back covers are somewhat plasticky, which is wonderful: You get the sense that if you had this in your bag and, say, a water bottle spilled, it would make it out mostly unscathed. The inside is similarly unadorned but efficient: The lines are subtle but not too subtle, the pages are detachable, and writing on them feels smooth and comfortable. This is like the Frances McDormand of notebooks: handsome, no-nonsense, and timeless. \u2014Katy Schneider Total: 4.675 $14 for 2 at Amazon Buy $14 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\n11. Leuchtturm1917 Medium A5 Dotted Hardcover Notebook\n\nType: Dotted Design: 5 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 4.5 | The Cover: 4 What is there to say about the Leuchtturm1917 Medium A5 Dotted Hardcover Notebook that hasn\u2019t been said before? It\u2019s a classic right up there in the ranks with Mead and Moleskine and is beloved by both bullet journalers and regular note-takers alike. While I am not a bullet journaler, I have used this notebook in the past and find it to be a reliable, versatile notebook. The level of quality is high without feeling too precious. And oh, the dotted grid! I absolutely adore it. I\u2019ll pretty much scribble in anything, but that page design is my ideal: It gives just the right amount of constraint and freedom. At the end of the day, the Leuchtturm1917 delivers on its hype. \u2014DP Total score: 4.6 $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\n12. Piccadilly Dot Grid Essential Notebook\n\nType: Dot grid Design: 4.5 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 5 | The Cover: 5 The dot grid on these pages extends to the edges, but none of the dots are cut off, which is a little design detail that set my most obsessive tendencies at ease. As a result, the dot grid isn\u2019t distracting at all, and it\u2019s so appealing to write in. The pages are nice and thick and smooth, and the ink doesn\u2019t bleed through at all. That makes it feel like you\u2019re writing in something special. One warning: The paper isn\u2019t bleached, so pages do look a little vintage, or, if you\u2019re being less generous, dingy. This notebook is the one that felt most like a journal, something that you\u2019d want to spill your deepest thoughts and feelings into. (In fact, it felt a little gauche filing it with to-do lists.) It feels substantial, and the faux-leather front cover has a wonderfully touchable texture, yet it\u2019s not too heavy to carry to meetings in the office. And the fact that there\u2019s zero branding makes the notebook seem more expensive than it is. \u2014Maxine Builder Total score: 4.6 $7 at Barnes & Noble Buy\n\n13. Leuchtturn1917 Bullet Journal\n\nType: Dotted Design: 4 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 5 | The Cover: 4 I loved the freedom this dotted notebook gave me. Saying my handwriting is imperfect is being generous, so not being confined to lines was the confidence boost I needed. My pen didn\u2019t bleed and showed up clear and sharp on the page. The hardcover seems tough, but it is still light enough to carry around. The Bullet Journal logo on the front is the only downside to the appearance. It\u2019s not a big deal, but a plain black cover would make this perfect. \u2014Jenna Milliner-Waddell Total score: 4.5 $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\n14. Comp Notebook\n\nType: Blank Design: 5 | Page Quality: 3 | Overall feel: 5 | The Cover: 5 The pages of this upscale take on a classic composition notebook are generously big, so I have lots of space to write my daily to-do list at the top and also jot down thoughts throughout the day and the occasional doodle. It doesn\u2019t force me to contain my unruly handwriting because it\u2019s lineless. My only issue is that it is a struggle to write on the back (which I like to do to save paper). I saw some indentations on the paper when I wrote particularly hard in some spots, and the page doesn\u2019t lie flat unless you heavily crease it. The cover always opens flat, though, so no issues there. \u2014CA Total score: 4.5 [Editor\u2019s Note: This notebook is currently out of stock. In the meantime, you can buy a classic composition notebook here.] Request price at Kickstarter Buy\n\n15. Stalogy 016 Vintage Notebook\n\nType: Lined Design: 4 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall Feel: 4 | The Cover: 5 This notebook immediately commands your attention with its bright-red cover. It\u2019s also super-skinny, which I like, even though it takes up the second-most surface area of the notebooks I received. Its cover is paper (or cardboard), which won\u2019t bode well for wear and tear but makes it super-easy to fold in half (it\u2019s so thin that if you fold it and push down to crease along the binding, it will stay open to a half-page on its own). The pages, which have the thinner lines I like, are easy to rip out, though they don\u2019t tear perfectly as they\u2019re not perforated. Tellingly, this calls itself \u201ca notebook without the needless frills\u201d \u2014 and the company is Japanese. I just wish it came in a smaller size (to take up less desk space). \u2014Anthony Rotunno Total score: 4.5 $7 at Colours May Vary Buy\n\n16. Monocle Wallet Notebook\n\nType: Blank Design: 4 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 5 | The Cover: 5 I really like the shape of this notebook \u2014 it\u2019s tall and slender, so it looks sleek and compact, but it still has enough space to write on a page. The pages are unlined, which I don\u2019t love (I find that I cycle through pages faster in unlined books because I\u2019ll write more willy-nilly and then feel like there\u2019s too much going on). It\u2019s a hardcover, non-spiral bound notebook, and the pages are not perforated, but they did rip out easier than in other bound ones I tried (didn\u2019t leave any jagged edges behind). But because it is a hardcover notebook, I can\u2019t fold it in half like I like to do. The smudging is more apparent on this one than the Black \u2019N Red, though it\u2019s not the worst of the bunch. The paper doesn\u2019t feel overly heavy or light; weight is not something I noticed when touching/using it. This notebook has some bells and whistles that make it more functional than your average one \u2014 like the Black \u2019N Red, it has an elastic to hold it open to your page. It also has a ribbon in it to mark your page. And it has a little accordion folder on the back for stashing other things. Pulling it out would make anyone look distinguished. Its design definitely lends it to be more the type of notebook you might take on a trip to jot down notes, addresses, or other bits of information, rather than a notebook you might bring to work or class to sort of outline and prioritize. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing! Perhaps the best looking I tested. \u2014AR Total score: 4.5 $46 at Need Supply Co. Buy\n\n17. Kiriko Grid Notebook\n\nType: Gridded Design: 5 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 5 | The Cover: 4 An all-around useful and attractive notebook, the Kiriko was my favorite of the seven I tried. It\u2019s good-looking without being distracting and functional while still feeling special. The textured linen cover features an abstract wavelike pattern, and a red thread down the spine gives it a handmade look. It\u2019s what I would consider a journal-size notebook, and I\u2019ve carried it around in my bag for a few days without it showing any signs of wear. Each page has a clean, gray grid that functions as a writing guideline and is especially nice for making lists. There\u2019s also no ink bleed-through. The notebook doesn\u2019t naturally lie flat when it\u2019s open, so you\u2019ll have to give the spine a little bend, which it can handle without looking creased. \u2014Karen Iorio Adelson Total score: 4.5 $13 at Kiriko Buy\n\n18. Life Noble Notebook\n\nType: Blank Design: 5 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall Feel: 4 | The Cover: 4 Full disclosure: I was really excited when I saw that I had been assigned the LIFE notebook. As an occasional lurker in stationery sub-Reddits and fountain-pen blogs, I\u2019d heard a lot about these cult-y Japanese notebooks. They\u2019re really expensive, though, which is why I\u2019ve never bought one. From experience, I know that I tend to not actually write in fancier notebooks because they\u2019re almost intimidating \u2014 is any to-do list really worth messing up this beautiful, unbleached, velvety and thick paper? That\u2019s something I need to get over, on a personal level, but if you\u2019re inclined to that sort of thinking, this notebook will bring that out. But, if you can get over that \u2014 as I did, in order to test this out \u2014 this thing is a pleasure to write on, honestly. The paper is really, really smooth. And no bleed-through with fountain pens. Like none at all. But it\u2019s still not overly thick, and LIFE actually manages to get 100 pages into a pretty small package. It also folds open with ease \u2014 as in, it\u2019s easy to spread both pages out and lay it flat without one side awkwardly bunching up. That might sound like a small thing, but it really makes a difference, and it comes up a lot with smaller A5 notebooks. There are also three tiny cardboard dividers in the binding that you can\u2019t really see \u2014 they\u2019re maybe a quarter-inch \u2014 but they could let you section things off. The cover is just thick paper stock, so it\u2019s hard to imagine this not getting messed up unless you\u2019re careful. I\u2019m kind of mad because now that I\u2019ve tried this \u2014 it\u2019s going to be hard to go back to anything else. \u2014David Notis Total score: 4.5 $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\n19. Moleskine Classic Pocket Notebook\n\nType: Lined Design: 4.5 | Page Quality: 4.5 | Overall feel: 4.25 | The Cover: 4.75 Just your classic Moleskine notebook here. We know the pages to be beautiful and soft, its hardbound cover to be pebbly smooth. Though as someone who tends to leave notebooks at my desk, with the exception of a few trips around the office to meetings or the art department, I like one that lies flat. This style always seems better suited to travel. But it\u2019s a classic for a reason, and the \u201cMyrtle Green\u201d shade is a nice non-black yet still professional-feeling color. \u2014SK\ufeff Total score: 4.5 $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\n20. Kate Spade Take Note Monogram Notebook\n\nType: Lined Design: 4 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 4 | The Cover: 5 This notebook is slightly whimsical with the petite messages on the front, but still sophisticated with its leatherette cover and gold-foil edges. I wish it were bigger, but there are a generous number of pages to make up for it. I appreciate how thick the pages are because the ink doesn\u2019t bleed through. Even with messy handwriting and lots of abuse, this notebook still looks clean. \u2014CA Total score: 4.5 $22 at Amazon Buy $22 at Amazon Buy\n\n21.

To be clear, it also feels much more like an art supply than an office supply. Its blank pages are substantial and satisfying to flip through. They hold ink without bleeding through or spreading out from the initial line \u2014 something you can\u2019t always say about art papers. It has a soft cover and a pocket for ephemera in the back. I don\u2019t think I would carry this around with me much, but as a desk notebook, I like it a lot. The one I tested is the large size, but this notebook also comes in medium and small, which look much more practical for daily use or travel. \u2014LC Total score: 4.375 $19 at Amazon Buy $19 at Amazon Buy\n\n22. ban.do Rough Draft Large Spiral Notebook\n\nType: Lined Design: 4 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 4 | The Cover: 4 I love a good spiral notebook. This one in particular will never leave my desk because it\u2019s too clunky to fit in my bag. But I admire how large it is for writing notes. There\u2019s so much room to let my large handwriting breathe. Plus I can write in the margins and have enough space up top to properly label each page, making it easier to go back to my notes later. I find the brand name at the bottom of each page slightly distracting. It also prevents me from being able to write in that section, but I\u2019m not completely offended by it because it\u2019s very in keeping with the brand. I personally enjoy the fun cover, which also is a trademark of Ban.do. It even has a hot-pink divider halfway through the pages that tells me I\u2019m \u201cStraight-Up Magic.\u201d This notebook definitely boosts my mood. \u2014CA Total score: 4.25 $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\n23. Iron Curtain Press The Standard Notebook, Mint\n\nType: Gridded Design: 5 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 4 | The Cover: 4 There\u2019s plenty of room to write, which I, as someone with huge, loopy handwriting, appreciate. And instead of having the grids go from the top of the page to the bottom, there\u2019s a fat margin at the top, similar to what you\u2019d find on classic loose-leaf paper. It just gives the page a little bit of breathing room, making it more appealing to write in. The grids too, though a bright blue, aren\u2019t overwhelming. The page is more khaki than white, almost like a manila folder, so it looks a little dingy. But the ink barely bled through the page, and it\u2019s smooth to write on. The best way I can describe this notebook is chubby, but that\u2019s a good, charming thing. I think that\u2019s because the dimensions of the notebook are more square than rectangular, so it\u2019s a little easier to port around and stuff into a backpack or purse. The metal spirals are wide enough that I don\u2019t feel like the pages are going to catch, and they feel sturdy. The main reason I\u2019m docking points is because the front cover is mint-green card stock, which doesn\u2019t seem too sturdy. This notebook has a decidedly vintage feel, which is fun and feels fancier and more bespoke than a spiral notebook from the drugstore. \u2014MB Total score: 4.25 $22 at Shorthand Buy $22 at CW Pencil Enterprise Buy\n\n24. Hiromi Paper Washi Notebook\n\nType: Blank Design: 4 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall feel: 4.5 | The Cover: 4.5 Hiromi Paper is a Culver City-based stationery store that is dedicated to bringing Japanese paper products to the U.S. The Washi notebooks are all made in Kyoto. My tester had geometric designs. It feels both graphic and distinct but not overly fussy. The inside has cream-colored paper is supple and smooth and a joy to write on. The notebook is held together by a single thread. It feels like a lot of care went into making it. That being said, since the cover is just a thick paper (albeit a beautiful, textured, thick paper), held together by a (literal) thread, it is a bit delicate. I do think this is a notebook that needs to be babied a bit, but it\u2019s worth the extra attention. And if you want a notebook that nobody else has, then I couldn\u2019t recommend it enough. \u2014DP Total score: 4.25 $9 at Hiromi Paper Buy\n\n25. Shinola Large Hard Linen Journal\n\nType: Lined Design: 3.5 | Page Quality: 3.5 | Overall feel: 5 | The Cover: 5 This is an understated notebook with a sophisticated linen cover. It feels extremely sturdy and seems like it could hold up to a great deal of wear and tear. And there are other elegant features as well, including a ribbon bookmark, an elastic band to keep the notebook closed, and a built-in folder on the inside of the back cover to store loose pages. The lined pages themselves are fine: They\u2019re thick enough that there was no bleed-through from my pen but not thick enough to feel particularly fancy. Picture standard loose-leaf that is slightly thicker. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable; it just doesn\u2019t match the quality of the cover. While the notebook is ever-so-slightly larger and heavier than I typically prefer, you can tell this is a notebook that is durable enough to earn the extra space it takes up in your bag. \u2014DP\ufeff Total score: 4.25 $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\n26. Mossery Hardcover Threadbound Notebook\n\nType: Blank, lined, or dotted Design: 5 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 5 | The Cover: 3 I found this one really interesting. There\u2019s a whole section in the front with very loose \u201cprompts\u201d to draw or post a picture of yourself or places you find inspiring, jot down goals and priorities, etc. I found this kind of corny at first, but I actually think it\u2019s a really nice touch now that I\u2019ve had some time with the notebook. It\u2019s not for everyone, but I appreciate how earnestly designed it is, and I think those exercises really can help get the creativity flowing and make the notebook feel more personal from the beginning. It\u2019s a little off-tone if you\u2019re just using this for jotting down random notes and lists, but if you want it to be more of a daily planner, casual diary, or bullet-journal type thing, I think it would be a really nice touch. Also the paper is great, smooth with almost no bleedthrough, and it\u2019s still very thin, so it has a lot of pages in there. It takes reusable notebooks that you can swap out, which is practical and environmentally friendly. And another benefit is that the inserts have a soft binding, so you get the easy lie-flat spreadability of that style combined with the durable hardcover exterior. Also, it has two pockets. I don\u2019t know what to do with even one of those notebook-pocket things, but this has two. \u2014DN Total score: 4.25 $25 at Mossery Buy\n\n27.

I actually used their notebooks for a lot of my classes in college. (Not to date myself too much, but Moleskines were the hot notebook on the scene at the time, and I wanted to be different). Rhodia is a French company known well in stationery and fountain-pen circles for its high-quality paper. And the reputation is definitely deserved. The paper is very luxe and smooth. No bleed-through. It\u2019s not quite as elegant as the LIFE notebook paper, but it\u2019s still a standout for sure. Of all the notebooks I tested, this is the one I actually ended up using the most, but that\u2019s because it just sat on my desk and I scribbled on it throughout the day. This thing is big \u2014 bigger than a standard American legal pad \u2014 so it\u2019s not the most portable. But it\u2019s great for leaving on the desk. One other great thing: The paper rips out super-easy and clean, which is often an issue with top-bound pad-style notebooks. One not-so-great thing: There\u2019s no slightly larger \u201cheader\u201d section like you have on most American paper pads, and I found myself really missing this. But for a pad with fancy paper, it\u2019s hard to imagine doing better than this. \u2014DN\ufeff Total score: 4.25 $11 at Amazon Buy $10 at Blick Art Supplies Buy\n\n28.

It is very simple: a gray, cardboard-y cover, simple yellow-thread binding, and 72 sturdy, smooth pages. Unlike with Moleskine (which is a similar size), this, I fear, wouldn\u2019t survive any sort of in-bag spill, but that\u2019s okay: A set of three costs a mere $12.

While the (blank) pages are smooth to write on (with no bleed-through at all), the size (about nine-by-six inches) and heft (heavy) of this notebook relegates it to the \u201cspecial occasion\u201d category, for at-the-desk to-do lists or intelligent thoughts \u2014 it\u2019s not something I would choose to carry around with me on the daily grind. \u2014KS Total score: 4.25 $26 at CW Pencil Enterprise Buy\n\n30.

It takes up minimal room in a bag or coat and could be stuffed into a back pocket. It\u2019s impressively weatherproof, too. After I scribbled a page with Sharpie, dribbled water on it, and wiped it with my hand, the ink didn\u2019t smear or bleed through. And, when dried, the paper returned to its original texture, without telltale waterlogged waviness.

Maruman A5 Spiral Notebook\n\nType: Gridded Design: 5 | Page Quality: 4.5 | Overall Feel: 4 | The Cover: 3 When I think of a graph-lined notebook page, this is what I imagine. The grid fills the entire page, from the bottom to the top, with no margins or gaps, and yet it\u2019s not overwhelming or distracting to look at. That\u2019s because the lines themselves are a delicate dove gray, visible enough to keep my handwriting in check but not so loud as to distract from my words. My Baron Fig Squire pen raced over the page \u2014 the paper is that smooth and silky to write on. The only reason I\u2019m docking any points is because there were some issues with ink bleed-through, but even those were minor. With brown cardboard covers and a spiral binding, this notebook should feel worse than it does, and certainly the design doesn\u2019t scream \u201cluxury.\u201d But the cardboard is pretty rigid and feels firm; it\u2019s also got an almost glossy texture on the outside, which is nice to the touch. It\u2019s fairly portable and packable, though already, I\u2019m seeing some of the metal coils get bent out of place. This is a nice-looking spiral notebook, with clean design and minimal branding, but it is still a spiral notebook, so it doesn\u2019t really look fancy. \u2014MB Total score: 4.125 $22 for 5 at Amazon Buy $22 for 5 at Amazon Buy\n\n33. Mark\u2019s Storage.it Notebook\n\nType: Blank and lined Design: 5 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall feel: 4 | The Cover: 3 As a lined notebook lover, I fell hard for this one. The lined pages are all on the right-hand side of the notebook, and the backs of the pages, the left side, are covered in some sort of subtle design. While I\u2019m sure the unlined side would be useful for some, I liked that this encouraged me to write only on the right-hand side instead of trying to fight gravity, holding down the lighter side of the notebook to make it useful. It also helps when flipping through the pages looking for notes to have everything on one side. My black-ink pen showed up, well, black on the page, which I liked. Other notebooks turned the ink into a faint gray that had me questioning if I was actually using a No. 2 pencil to write my to-do list. The ink doesn\u2019t bleed through exactly, but holding a single sheet up to the light, you can definitely see through it. This didn\u2019t bother me since the backside of the page isn\u2019t for writing anyway. It\u2019s not a hardcover notebook, but the plastic outside does give it a nice weight and tough exterior. I was able to toss this in my bag without fear of the corners of the cover turning up or getting marked up from the capless pen in my bag. It\u2019s almost like you don\u2019t have to think about it, which for me, someone who doesn\u2019t care much about the condition of their notebook, worked well. If you care that much about the appearance of your notebook, this can easily be wiped down for regular cleaning. \u2014JM-W Total score: 4 $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\n34. Smythson Soho Notebook\n\nType: Blank Design: 3 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 4 | The Cover: 5 I will start this off by saying that when I got the Smythson notebook to test, I felt like I won the lottery. I\u2019ve used one of its Panama Diaries annually for the last several years, and like countless others, I am a huge fan of the brand for its aesthetics and its functional agendas. So it started out slightly ahead of the pack of other contenders. That said, it did not emerge as the favorite of the ones I tested \u2014 not because it isn\u2019t a good notebook but because I just think there were other notebooks that worked better as notebooks. It is indeed well made, with the soft grosgrain leather cover, sewn binding, and ribbon to mark your page. From experience, I can attest that leather-covered Smythson notebooks and agendas only get better with age and wear, whether you\u2019re using them or they\u2019re just sitting on a shelf with their spine sticking out. Its handsomeness alone would make me want to use it every day, and its simple page design would not discourage daily use, either. But the sewn binding does make it hard to rip out pages in a pinch. And there\u2019s nothing that adds functional aspects to its design aside from the ribbon. Before I embarked on testing, I would have told you there is no better-looking notebook than a Smythson. But the Monocle\u2019s trim size and neat look I think just edged out this notebook in terms of which one I found the most aesthetically pleasing. That could be because, after years of using Smythson\u2019s diaries, there was no real wow factor about the notebook. (Can you become jaded by notebooks? I guess so.) \u2014AR\ufeff Total score: 4 $245 at Smythson Buy\n\n35. Orihon Japanese Accordion Notebooks\n\nType: Blank Design: 3 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall feel: 4 | The Cover: 5 This notebook is similar in size to a reporter\u2019s notebook, and the no-spine design made me want to flip it open dramatically with one hand like a detective in a movie. Upon further inspection, I realized my Nancy Drew fantasy wasn\u2019t possible. The back and front cover of this notebook aren\u2019t attached at any point, and it opens accordion style. While I was intrigued by the design, I didn\u2019t actually want to write anything in it. I was confused mostly and didn\u2019t know where to begin. This felt like more of a keepsake or the place a long, passionate love letter or vows would be written in, not my grocery list. If you do have notes worthy of this, the paper is very thick. It has that handmade look and feel, what I imagine the Declaration of Independence was written on. The texture however did not lend itself well to my Bic pen. It did not bleed through the page but spread the ink out, giving my script a dull, thick appearance instead of the clean, skinny lines this pen typically delivers on normal printer paper. As for the size, it\u2019s great for carrying around. It\u2019s small and light enough to fit in most bags, but I wouldn\u2019t toss this anywhere \u2014 it\u2019s too pretty. It doubles as desk d\u00e9cor, for sure. If there is such a thing as a status notebook, this is it. Not only is it fragile, but the beautiful textured pastel-colored cover is enough to draw someone\u2019s attention. When they learn it\u2019s unlined, they will assume you have perfect penmanship and that is a flex in itself. \u2014JM-W Total score: 4 $16 at Hiromi Paper Buy\n\n36.

It\u2019s a great notebook \u2014 easy to carry around, nice-quality paper, handsome without being showy (and available in a lovely range of colors) \u2014 but its big promise of lying flat did not quite hold up.

Postalco Notebook A6\n\nType: Gridded Design: 3 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 4 | The Cover: 5 A luxury take on the classic reporter\u2019s notepad, this spiral-top notebook is both thoughtfully designed and a pleasure to use. Because of its compact size, you can easily write in it while holding it in your hands, without using a flat surface, and it\u2019ll fit in most bags. There\u2019s still enough room on each page to fit several lines of writing, so you don\u2019t have to flip to a new page too quickly. The starched-cotton cover is thick and durable, and the back cover extends over the spirals for a clean look. Its pages are thick and smooth to write on, with very minimal bleed-through. While there\u2019s a light-blue grid pattern on the pages, the squares are so far too tiny to actually write in, so the grid acts more like a design element than a useful guide. It functions essentially as a blank notebook, which is probably fine for the type of quick writing you\u2019ll be doing with this pad. \u2014KIA Total score: 4 $20 at Canoe Design Buy $20 at Moth Buy\n\n38. Black N\u2019 Red Notebook\n\nType: Lined Design: 4 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall Feel: 4 | The Cover: 3 Functionally, this notebook is maybe the best of all, even though I don\u2019t necessarily love spirals. That\u2019s because I do love being able to fold my notebooks (so they\u2019re half the size than they would be fully opened), and the spiral just makes that so easy. Plus this has an elastic on its back cover that you can use to hold the notebook folded open to the page you\u2019re writing on. The lines are lines \u2014 they\u2019re not too dark or light and are a bit wider to allow for bigger penmanship. Also, there is a sort of too-earnest page in the front with motivational language asking for objectives, which I don\u2019t really care for but power journalers might like. The Black \u2019n\u2019 Red has pretty great paper. I am a lefty, and I tested all my notebooks with a pencil, and this excelled at the smudge test. That said, the paper is more transparent than that of some of the other notebooks I\u2019ve tried, like the Paperblanks. It\u2019s often hard to see lead through a page, but on this one, you can \u2014 it\u2019s not hugely pronounced, but it\u2019s not faint enough not to notice or care, either. At roughly five-by-eight inches, it\u2019s pretty small in the grand scheme; this would totally slip into a standard-size tote, backpack, or a work bag like mine. I don\u2019t dig the black-and-red color scheme (it\u2019s a little Satanic), but otherwise it\u2019s a fairly simple-looking book \u2014 in a good way. A little more hefty and distinguished than a Mead; not immature. Although maybe a tad too serious. \u2014AR Total score: 4 $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\n39.

As a kid, I assumed they were expensive, but now I\u2019m realizing that $10 for three is a pretty solid deal and she just knew these still weren\u2019t worth it. As an experienced user now, I know this stitched-bound paperback notepad with few pages isn\u2019t exactly something to covet, but it gets the job done. As a casual note-taker who doesn\u2019t need much more, the simple lined pages are enough for me. The weight of the cover is a bit sturdier than other paperback notebooks I tested, so I don\u2019t have the same fear of it ripping, but it\u2019s still not lasting forever. These might be a status symbol for a suburban tween, but most adults will know this isn\u2019t the best you can get, even at this price point. \u2013JM-W Total score: 4 $9 for 3 at Amazon Buy $9 for 3 at Amazon Buy\n\n40.

Unfortunately, just like other paper notebooks, the cover is always slightly ajar from trying to fold it and hold it open. This only makes it harder to keep the cover and inside pages intact. If you don\u2019t plan on traveling with it, this will do just fine at your desk. The inside is simple and lined, which I can appreciate. They are also wider than the lines of a Muji or Moleskine notebook, which for me made the task of filling the page a little less daunting. The pages are also pretty sturdy and held up to my tug test.

Blueline A9 Notebook\n\nType: Lined $6 (was $9, now 33% off) Design: 5 | Page Quality: 3 | Overall Feel: 5 | The Cover: 3 I\u2019m not really evaluating this one as a daily notebook because it doesn\u2019t really make sense for that, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the original intent. It\u2019s big, and it\u2019s basically bound like a thin hardcover photo album, so it\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to want to use to jot down grocery lists. This seems like it\u2019s intended more for archiving purposes, and for that I think it\u2019s pretty close to perfect. There\u2019s a page of sticky labels in the back to place on the cover and the spine and then sticky tabs to section off areas of the notebook. For administrative needs or record-keeping, this would really come in handy. There\u2019s nothing fancy, no crazy new organizational principle. It feels very \u201cfederal,\u201d if that makes sense \u2014 neat and organized, straightforward, not making any splash but efficient. It has a wide margin on the inside of the page, which I\u2019m sure people who keep records would find better uses for than drawing cubes and stick figures, as I did. A final note: I didn\u2019t Google this until after writing my review (to be objective!), but a quick search confirmed my impression that this is a cult-y archive notebook. There are pictures of tons of these set out on bookshelves with labels on the spine visible, which make them simultaneously satisfying and frightening to look at. \u2014DN\ufeff Total score: 4 $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\n42.

That said, it does its job. The pages are still a little thin but thicker than the unlined Muji notebook pages, and the dots are in an unobtrusive shade of gray that helps keep my writing neat without feeling overly restrictive the way graph paper might. I would happily carry this around all day again, too. And I know this sounds like an insult, but I mean it as praise: I wouldn\u2019t feel bad about using this as a coaster on my desk in a pinch.

And I\u2019m a fan of its large and midsize softcover notebooks, too \u2014 but the large lined hardcover just didn\u2019t cut it for me. First of all, it\u2019s heavy. When I carried it home in my tote bag, the weight was similar to that of a 200-page hardcover book. I guess the upside to the heavyweight model is that the notebook feels very sturdy, and I didn\u2019t worry about it getting damaged in my bag. Weight aside, the notebook has a lot to offer: The page quality is excellent and has that classic Bavarian-cream color of all Moleskine pages. The lines on the page are a faint gray color with spacing that is a little claustrophobic, in a good way. Writing in them forces me to stay neat. \u2014HR\ufeff Total score: 3.875 $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\n44.

It\u2019s also quite light, despite its size (large: about six-by-nine inches). The issues I had with this notebook were twofold: First, if you happen to flip the cover back while you\u2019re writing, that cover will not recover \u2014 it retains a deep crease and will forevermore pop up when you lay the notebook on its back. And second, the pages (which are otherwise blank) have two thin vertical pink lines that run down the pages about two inches from each side. Those lines (while actually quite pretty!) are constraining \u2014 writing outside them made me feel deeply uncomfortable, but writing inside them meant whole inches of each page were wasted. \u2014KS Total score: 3.875 $14 at Need Supply Co.

It came with a pencil tucked in the side holder, but I swapped it out for my pen, and it worked just as well. The page texture was a little scratchy, but the pages themselves have a high-quality thickness that falls somewhere between writing and drawing paper. On the inside cover, there is a log where you can clock the date, content, and page count each time you write, which doesn\u2019t seem like something I\u2019d ever use but, I imagine, could be useful if you had some journaling goals to meet. Overall, this one seemed very practical, without too many bells and whistles, and the kind of thing you could stick in your bag every day and feel confident that it would still be in good shape a few weeks (maybe months) later. \u2014HR\ufeff Total score: 3.875 $23 at Need Supply Co.

The one I tested has a light-pink cover with a floral pattern that feels a bit juvenile and cutesy, but it would be nice for someone who\u2019s into that. (The company has a range of cover styles, so it\u2019s possible that you\u2019d find a design you like.) I like that it\u2019s simple: The pages are dot-gridded and the corners are rounded, a plus for me. There are two ribbon markers, a back pocket, an elastic pen holder, and an elastic band to keep the notebook closed. It has a lay-flat design, another plus. While I do not bullet journal, I can see this being ideal for someone who does, as the 160 GSM paper would lend itself nicely to the use of markers and fountain pens. Even though it\u2019s A5-size, the thicker paper and hardcover make it a little too bulky for my liking. Still, I can tell it\u2019s well made and that it would hold up to extensive use. \u2014Lauren Ro\ufeff Total score: 3.875 $31 at Archer & Olive Buy\n\n47. Stalogy Editor\u2019s Series 365 Days Notebook\n\nType: Gridded Design: 3.5 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 4 | The Cover: 4 The lines of the grid are wonderfully thin, in a subtle light gray that offers enough structure without being visually overbearing. But this is more of a day planner than a notebook. In fact, self-described \u201cpower planner user\u201d Perrin Drumm included it in her roundup of the best planners (not notebooks). And a lot of the features that make it a good planner make it a discouraging notebook. For instance, the grids are numbered from 0 to 24, denoting the 24 hours in a day, and each page has a spot to fill in the date, which makes it feel like I should only be using a page a day, when, in reality, I use at least two. The paper is very thin, almost as delicate as the onionskin paper you find in Bibles, and while writing, I always had a slight fear of puncturing the sheet with my pen. But amazingly, I didn\u2019t, and even more amazingly, the ink barely bled through onto the other side (though my handwriting was somewhat visible). The thin paper means the notebook itself is pretty slim, even though it has 368 pages (one for every day of the year and then some). The lay-flat binding is truly lay-flat, and the size is fairly portable. The cover is exceptionally soft and flexible, which isn\u2019t a bad thing, but I am frankly skeptical that it would withstand a lot of wear and tear, especially since the corners already started to show use after only a couple of days of light use. But the gold embossing on the cover makes the whole thing look a little bit classier and more expensive than it actually is. \u2014MB Total score: 3.875 $21 at Amazon Buy $21 at Amazon Buy\n\n48.

It would be a nice travel notebook because it\u2019s thin, blank so you could use it for sketching while sitting in a caf\u00e9, and the paper is of good quality and takes ink well. I don\u2019t usually like spiral-bound notebooks because they get tangled up in headphone wires and other stuff I often have floating around in my bag. But the portability and flexibility of this notebook pretty much makes up for that. Still, this feels more like a onetime-purchase notebook rather than something I would add to my core lineup of paper goods. \u2014LC\ufeff Total score: 3.825 $7 at Rad and Hungry Buy\n\n49.

The cover is a dignified shade of brownish charcoal gray, and made of a hard card-stock material, which gives you a sturdy writing surface even if you\u2019re using it while standing on the subway.

Moleskine Classic Hard Cover Large Reporter Notebook\n\nType: Blank, lined, or gridded $13 (was $16, now 19% off) Design: 3 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 5 | The Cover: 3 What I like: It\u2019s about as slender as the Monocle and Paperblanks ones (I\u2019m learning I prefer slender notebooks to wider ones). It\u2019s got more lines per page (30, to be exact), and they\u2019re narrower \u2014 I like a narrower line. It\u2019s also got an accordion pocket in the back \u2014 it\u2019s not as big as the Monocle notebook\u2019s, but honestly, that one may be too big for what you need (this one seems like a more subtle way to get the same function). And it has an elastic band to keep the notebook open. I also, in theory, like a memo-pad style (that opens vertically, not horizontally) \u2014 but I think it\u2019s key for a memo pad to be able to fold over, otherwise you have this giant, long, scroll-like thing taking up most of your desk. And that\u2019s exactly my biggest problem with this notebook: Because it is hardcover, you cannot fold it over, so it becomes unwieldy (you need a fair amount of space to keep it open). As I said, I\u2019m a fan of the pages themselves for their many narrower lines. They do smudge a bit, but sort of the same amount as the Monocle or Paperblanks. Individual pages don\u2019t rip out easily (I pulled out a couple of pages when I only wanted to rip one). And they\u2019re fairly transparent (I can see my scribbles on the reverse side of a page). In terms of feel, they are comparable to the Black \u2019N\u2019 Red, a bit velvety to the touch. When closed, this notebook is as compact and thin as the Monocle, so it would take up less space in a bag or tote than most of the other notebooks I reviewed. \u2014AR\ufeff Total score: 3.75 $13 at Amazon Buy $13 at Amazon Buy\n\n51.

It is in fact a keepsake notebook, unlike all the others I\u2019ve used (and tested), and definitely fun. But I found the patterned pages to be distracting, and it was difficult to read my notes, especially on the pages where the grids are bicolored. I use a fine-point pen, and my scribbles got lost among the lines (to be fair, my handwriting is terrible). I did enjoy how each page was a surprise (there are eight grid designs), and I could imagine using it for a special project or as a diary, but for everyday note-taking, I prefer more standard fare. As for aesthetics, it looks great: I love the cherry fabric hardback cover, the portable size, and the thick paper, which would lend itself nicely to the use of felt-tip markers, making it a perfect gift for an extreme bullet journaler. \u2014LR\ufeff Total score: 3.75 $13 at Amazon Buy $13 at Amazon Buy\n\n52. Appointed Lined Notebook\n\nType: Lined Design: 3 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 3 | The Cover: 5 There\u2019s a lot to like about this handsome notebook starting with its textured cloth cover, brass spiral rings, and subtle metallic logo. It\u2019s on the larger size for a personal notebook, but it\u2019ll still fit in most work bags. Inside, the pages are crisp and substantial, there\u2019s minimal ink bleed-through, and the lines are pale and nicely spaced so they\u2019re useful for writing without being distracting. There are some design details, though, that I found confusing. The pages are only lined on one side, leaving the reverse side blank. If you like writing with lines, this would encourage you to just use one side of each page, which seems wasteful. On the other hand, if you want a mix of lines for writing and blank space to sketch or draw, you might prefer this style. While lots of notebooks look fine without a top margin, the Appointed one looks like it\u2019s crying out for one. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on why, but it may be that the ruled left margin makes it look unbalanced. A plus about the pages is that they\u2019re perforated, so you can easily tear them out if needed. \u2014KIA Total score: 3.75 $24 at Need Supply Co. Buy $35 for 2 at Huckberry Buy\n\n53. Rite in the Rain Weatherproof Soft Cover Pocket Notebook\n\nType: Lined Design: 4 | Page Quality: 5 | Overall feel: 4 | The Cover: 2 I wasn\u2019t able to put this waterproof notebook through a storm, but just touching it, you can tell it\u2019s tough. The hardcover is sturdy, and I had no fear of the edges bending even slightly. The cover also has enough overhang that I felt the inside pages were sufficiently protected. The pages are lined horizontally, but there is also a faint dotted vertical grid behind it. It wasn\u2019t distracting but didn\u2019t add anything to my experience. For daily use in an office, this notebook is so heavy duty it looks out of place, but someone keeping a travel diary during a backpacking trip or working off-site would be able to rest easy knowing their notes were safe. \u2014JM-W Total score: 3.75 $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\n54.

It\u2019s a lined softcover notebook with a brown-paper cover. If you like practical, this is for you. It\u2019s small enough to tote around almost anywhere, but it\u2019s only 30 sheets thick, so don\u2019t expect to use this for any real length of time. Honestly, I don\u2019t think it would last longer than the time it takes to fill 60 pages anyway. Just sitting on my desk for a few days, where I eat lunch, this already had a couple of oil stains. The corners of the cover also started to turn up. The cover is plain, but a more artistic person than me could turn it into a masterpiece. Otherwise, the design is so common I imagine it wouldn\u2019t be hard to mix this up with someone else\u2019s. \u2014JM-W Total score: 3.75 $20 for 5 at Amazon Buy $19 for 5 at eBay Buy\n\n55. Leuchtturm1917 HardCover Master Slim Notebook A4+\n\nType: Dotted Design: 4 | Page Quality: 3.5 | Overall Feel: 3.5 | The Cover: 4 This is a huge notebook. It\u2019s nearly 9 by 12.4 inches and is hardcover. It reminds me of a restaurant-reservation book or an oversize teacher\u2019s gradebook. It has a three-page table of contents, and the rest of it is dot-gridded. There are page numbers that start on the right-hand side (I\u2019ve learned this is not a given with notebooks!), rounded corners (another plus), an expandable pocket in the back that can hold A4 sheets, two ribbon markers, and an elastic closure. It opens flat. This notebook is meant to live on a desk. I can\u2019t imagine carrying it around unless in a portfolio or a briefcase because it\u2019s so big, but it\u2019s slim \u2014 only 121 pages. Actually, I think it might even work as a portfolio itself. You could easily slip a couple copies of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 within its pages without them sticking out and take the whole thing on a job interview. It looks that polished, thanks, in part, to the smooth cover. Even though it\u2019s so unwieldy, I\u2019m drawn to it. The only design detail is a debossed logo on the back cover. The paper itself is a tad bit thick and rough for my liking, and there is slight ghosting (you can see the writing on the other side of the sheet, but there\u2019s no bleed-through), but it\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m trying to think of ways to incorporate this into my life.

Roaring Spring Chemistry Book\n\nType: Lined Design: 4 | Page Quality: 3 | Overall Feel: 3.5 | The Cover: 4.5 I picked this up from my college bookstore many, many years ago, and I still have it. I love its composition-notebook-style binding (center-sewn and tape-bound). It has a plain blue canvas cover, with rounded corners, green-tinted pages, blue narrow-ruled lines, and numbered pages (at the top right corner, and they start at 001). It\u2019s technically a chemistry notebook, but I use it as a journal. It\u2019s durable due to the hardback cover (and probably because it\u2019s meant to be used in a lab). The paper isn\u2019t particularly smooth (feels recycled), and there\u2019s a little bit of ghosting and a tiny bit of bleed-through, but it hardly matters because you can\u2019t beat the way it looks, if you\u2019re going for a retro-technical vibe. \u2014LR\ufeff Total: 3.75 $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\n57. Rollbahn Spiral Notebook (Mini Flip Memo)\n\nType: Gridded Design: 3 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall feel: 4 | The Cover: 4 This small but mighty Rollbahn really tickled me; I just love tiny things. At 3 inches wide and 4.5 inches tall, you could slip this little guy into your front pocket and be on your way. Plus the Rollbahn has a lot of well-thought-out details. The petite pages are outlined with a perfect grid: The squares are just the right size, and the lines themselves are lightly sketched onto the page, which offers just the right amount of order for note-taking. I also am a sucker for the Rollbahn covers. I know it\u2019s just thick cardboard with an elastic strap, but the color options are distinctive, and the simple logo is pleasing to the eye. The pages are also easy to rip out and I was delighted to find a handful of clear sheet protectors at the back \u2014 in the event you need to protect your notes from the elements. The main drawback with this notebook is also its greatest strength: its size. If you lay the notebook flat and try to write, your hand will keep bumping against the delicate spiral at the top of the pages, making it difficult to fill the whole page. And with pages this small, every inch counts. It works much better when holding it slightly upright in your hand. Not super-convenient for office meetings, but for a specific set of circumstances, like, say you\u2019re a reporter caught in a rainstorm trying to get a scoop, this is a good bet. \u2014DP Total score: 3.75 $7 at Yo Store!

Oysters Spiralbound Decomposition Book\n\nType: Dot grid Design: 4 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 3.5 | The Cover: 3.5 There\u2019s lots of room to write on these pages, and they feel effortlessly designed. The dotted grid is clear to follow but not distracting, though I do wish the blue was a little lighter in color. I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t note that the pages of these Decomposition Books are made with 100 percent recycled paper, since that\u2019s a main selling point. But the pages still feel smooth and easy to write on. They\u2019re fairly lightweight, and there\u2019s minimal bleed-through. Still, although this notebook is meant to mimic a classic composition notebook, it somehow feels flimsier than the traditional bound version that you can buy at a Duane Reade for a dollar. Maybe it\u2019s because the metal spirals on the notebook are very thin, or because the cardboard covers aren\u2019t laminated. It\u2019s a good, portable size, but it doesn\u2019t pack as easily into a bag as a bound composition notebook would. The all-over print on the front and back covers of this notebook feels a little childish, though I love the inside cover, which features some beautiful, intricate black-and-white illustrations of different natural phenomenon with fun facts (\u201cSputnik has never orbited the moon\u201d). The sum is a notebook that feels like someone just slapped a bunch of cool, vintage-inspired design elements together, rather than something with a cohesive design. \u2014MB\ufeff Total score: 3.75 $10 at Decomposition Buy\n\n59.

Something that I found a little off-putting, though, is that it\u2019s the exact size and shape of a paperback novel, with the binding of a paperback, too, so when I wrote in it, I felt like I was writing in an actual book and not a notebook. That aside, the page quality made it pleasant to use: The paper had the right amount of smoothness, and it held the ink from my Muji pen without it seeping through or smudging. The pages actually reminded me a little of stationery, so I tried to tear a page out to write a note, only to find that it\u2019s nearly impossible to rip a page out of this thing. That might speak to the overall sturdiness of the notebook, although I did find the card-stock cover easily ripped in my bag. \u2014HR\ufeff Total score: 3.687 $20 at Hay Buy\n\n60.

It has the same transparent plastic cover, similar double-ring spiral, and faint dot-grid paper that\u2019s smooth to write on. Because it\u2019s a spiral notebook, you can fold the cover all the way back, which makes it ideal for note-taking on the go. I like that I can put my pen in the spiral. I also appreciate the fact that the cover is slightly larger than the paper itself, which means that the edges are somewhat protected. I would feel comfortable throwing it in my bag. The paper is on the thinner side, which is my preference, and I don\u2019t mind the ghosting. It\u2019s straightforward and clean \u2014 everything I like when looking for a basic, utilitarian notebook that I don\u2019t have to be precious about when using.

Usually they\u2019re a little too fancy or precious looking. This somehow manages to straddle that line between practical and special. It\u2019s well priced, the leather looks good, and it takes refillable notebooks that easily slide into the cover. No, it\u2019s not going to make the same impression as a hand-stitched oiled leather one with fancy rough-edged paper, but honestly, I feel no one ends up actually using those. The leather cover on this is nice and sturdy \u2014 also subtly and softly padded, which is fun \u2014 and the paper is quite good and holds up well to a fountain pen even with very little bleed-through. I personally don\u2019t love the \u201csun\u201d design on my cover, but maybe that\u2019s just me. A notebook with a leather cover is definitely a strong move and probably not for everyone, but it does help signify that something is more of a \u201cdiary\u201d than a standard utilitarian notebook, and I think as far as that goes this is a really smart option. I imagine the leather would hold up well over time, and you could swap in the refills. This would be a good gift for a writer. \u2014DN Total score: 3.5 $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\n62.

It features credit-card-size slit pockets and a loop to hold a pen or pencil. While it\u2019s attractive (and definitely giftable), I found that the leather-covered notebook just didn\u2019t add much to my writing experience. The inside paper is fine \u2014 with medium thickness and stylish dotted lines \u2014 but the notebook won\u2019t lie flat, which made it difficult to write in whether I held it in my hands or on my desk.

Best Made The Hardcover Pocket Notebook\n\nType: Dot grid Design: 2 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 3 | The Cover: 5 I am on the record as a Best Made fangirl, but this sturdy and well-made notebook was one of the last ones I tested because the design of the notebook was so unappealing to me. The pages (there are only 48) are small, about the size of an iPhone, and yet the dotted grid is large, exactly one-half-inch per square. That\u2019s the largest grid of all the notebooks I tested. So the result is that I tried to write big enough so I could fill out the grid, but that, in turn, meant the page filled up after two or three sentences, and that made it an incredibly impractical choice for taking notes in meetings. Maybe it\u2019s better for diagrams or journaling in the great outdoors, but for my purposes, the design was a hindrance. The paper does feel luxurious, very smooth and thick with a light manila-folder tint, and there was functionally no bleed-through from my Baron Fig pen. Some favorite details include a ruler embossed into the linen back cover, printed page numbers, a place to put a start date and location on the inside front cover, as well as an end date on the inside back cover.

The bright-blue linen-bound hardback cover is highly appealing, and the gold embossing of the Graf von Faber-Castell seal (this is the luxury offshoot of the stationery company) is both subtle and elevating. Inside, the pages are blank and thread-stitched, and the only design element is a small illustration by Kera Till on the flyleaf. The slightly off-white paper itself is a bit scratchy for my preference and on the thin side, however, (while there\u2019s no bleed-through, you can see the writing on the other side of the sheet), and I noticed that some of the pages had to be separated. I thought this was maybe a design choice, but the product description doesn\u2019t indicate that (it\u2019s not deckle-edged).

The cream paper is mediumweight, and my pen glides smoothly when I\u2019m writing in it. The pages have square corners, as does the cover, but because the cover is soft, its corners got a little smushed. Still, I think it\u2019s hardy enough to withstand transport in a bag.

I don\u2019t know what kind of sorcery the company used to make this notebook, but I\u2019m very impressed. The pages have a waxy texture, but I\u2019m assuming that has to do with their being waterproof, so it\u2019s a painless thing to look past. It\u2019s too small, with far too few pages for me to use every day, but it\u2019s great to just keep in a bag.

Just a few complaints: The entire back half of the pages are blank (unlined), which is nice for freeform note-taking or doodling, but for my purposes (mostly making to-do lists), they\u2019re unnecessary; a few unlined pages in the back would have felt appropriate.

The paper quality is nice, and it doesn\u2019t feel crazy smooth like some of the fancier options, but in a way I think that makes it actually more inviting to write on. There was a small amount of bleed-through, but I tested everything out with a fountain pen (shout-out to Lamy Safari), which was maybe a little mean of me because that\u2019s a bit of a challenge for any paper. The lines are relatively narrow, but nothing crazy, and if you\u2019re using a compact notebook like this, you probably want smallish lines so you can at least get a fair amount down on the page. There\u2019s nothing about this that makes you say \u201cWow,\u201d but it\u2019s a really sturdy hardcover notebook that I think could take a beating in a tote bag or travel bag. \u2014DN\ufeff Total score: 3.5 $6 at Barnes & Noble Buy\n\n69.

It comes with a pen holder, elastic closure, two ribbon markers, and expandable pocket. Overall, it\u2019s too busy; too many bells and whistles for a non BuJo-er.

Emilio Braga Marbled Gridded Notebook\n\nPhoto: Augusta Sagnelli/Augusta Sagnelli Type: Gridded Design: 1.5 | Page Quality: 2.5 | Overall feel: 4 | The Cover: 5 I really, really wanted to give this handsome notebook top marks, because I adore the way it looks. It was love at first sight, really. The hardcover has an abstract marbled pattern in a muted olive green. Sort of like if your composition notebook had a cooler, older sister. It\u2019s nostalgic and reminds me of grade school but still feels grown-up. And the pattern is repeated on the edge of all of the pages, which is a nice touch. But once I opened it up, I discovered its fatal flaw: The grid that is printed on the pages is way too obtrusive. The lines themselves are super-dark, and the grid pattern is too cramped. I could barely read my notes, which is simply not practical. Had the pages been blank, this one could\u2019ve been a contender. Still, for those who prefer form over function, this would look great on a bedside table. \u2014DP Total score: 3.25 $28 at Sunday Shop Buy\n\n74. Moleskine Cahier Journal, Soft Cover, XL\n\nType: Lined $16 (was $19, now 16% off) Design: 4 | Page Quality: 3 | Overall feel: 3 | The Cover: 3 Full disclosure: This notebook has been one of my go-tos for a while now. As far as simple, standard full-size lined notebooks are concerned, I\u2019ve always bounced between this Moleskine Cahier and those Muji ones. I prefer the Moleskine because it\u2019s a bit bigger and just feels a little more interesting. (The cover breaks in a little over time, and I prefer the look of the Moleskine\u2019s threaded binding to the taped-over binding on the Muji notebooks.) It\u2019s a pretty big notebook, just a tiny bit smaller than a standard-size sheet of notebook paper, but for me that\u2019s ultimately the most comfortable size to write in. So if you want something a little larger, this can be good to bring to meetings and jot down notes throughout the day. The last 16 sheets in the back are perforated, so you can easily tear them off, which might not sound important but almost always comes in handy. The spacing between the lines is pretty small, so while you can definitely squeeze a lot onto each page, it could be an issue for people with larger handwriting. (I sometimes just go wild and take up two lines at a time, so that\u2019s always an option too.) There\u2019s nothing super-special about these, but I think that\u2019s what makes them so great in a way. Ink does bleed through to the other side a bit, but in general, the paper is pretty nice. They strike a nice middle ground in the notebook world: not so fancy that you\u2019re afraid to write in them, but also high quality enough that they feel like more than your standard-issue notebook. \u2014DN\ufeff Total: 3.25 $16 for 3 at Amazon Buy $16 for 3 at Amazon Buy\n\n75. Celestial Decomposition Book\n\nType: Lined Design: 3 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 3 | The Cover: 3 This notebook is the most \u201cquintessential\u201d looking notebook I received (it recalls the Mead marbled ones I used as a kid). That makes it inviting, I think, in a way that you know exactly what it\u2019s for. But instead of marble, the cover features a star map with constellations \u2014 maybe a bit too much for me, but at least interesting and a bit unexpected/atypical. One thing I love about the design is that, right on the cover, it tells you how many sheets (80) and pages (160) there are. It\u2019s sewn-binded, so pages are pretty easy to rip out, but they\u2019re not perfectly clean (the rip is similar to that of the Stalogy). It\u2019s the biggest notebook I got by footprint, both much thicker and slightly larger proportionally than the Stalogy (it\u2019s not the thickest, though; that goes to the Paperblanks). Its cover is a more rigid cardboard, so it can\u2019t really be used when folded over, even if you press hard or use a binder clip). Inside, the front and back covers have whimsical illustrations and measurements (including \u201cspeed of sound\u201d and \u201cspeed of hair growing\u201d), which are sort of in line with the cover art. Of all the notebooks I tested, this is the only one that specifically says it is made with recycled paper (and printed with soy ink, no less!). So you feel good about that. Otherwise, the pages are probably the least smooth and velvety of any of my notebooks, though they have 30 lines and are the narrow width that I like. The texture doesn\u2019t mean the pages feel flimsy or cheap; they\u2019re just not soft. But it\u2019s not like they gave me a papercut. And even though it takes up the most square footage of any of the notebooks I tried, it still would fit in a standard tote or bag (it passed my work-bag test). \u2014AR Total score: 3.25 $10 at Barnes & Noble Buy\n\n76. Poketo Object Notebook in Sandstone\n\nType: Blank Design: 2 | Page Quality: 3 | Overall feel: 2 | The Cover: 5 I loved the cover design on this notebook the most out of all the ones I tested. The large pages were also attractive because I could fit all my thoughts onto one page; however, once you open it and actually use it, the cover no longer will lie flat. Even when I pushed half the pages onto the cover to try and weigh it down, it still stuck up and just caused the paper (which actually is a tad thin) to flip back over. It\u2019s incredibly unbalanced, and the annoying experience detracted from its pleasing appearance. \u2014CA Total score: 3 $24 at Need Supply Co. Buy\n\n77.

The gray-and-black speckled design is on the cusp of being unique and cool, but the dull colors make it boring. The pages have a good weight to them. The cover doesn\u2019t offensively stick up either after opening it for the first time. I also have a good amount of space in this lineless design to write.

Fabriano EcoQua Spiral Notebook\n\nType: Gridded Design: 3.5 | Page Quality: 4.5 | Overall Feel: 2 | The Cover: 2 The gridded pages on this notebook are fine and certainly don\u2019t feel overdesigned. They go from edge to edge, and the lines themselves mostly aren\u2019t distracting. But the page doesn\u2019t feel special or especially appealing to write on in any meaningful way, either. The ink doesn\u2019t bleed through, but it\u2019s still relatively lightweight, which is nice for an everyday notebook. It\u2019s smooth for writing and feels surprisingly luxurious, especially given how mediocre the design is overall. I also liked that the page isn\u2019t bright, bright white but a slightly creamier hue. Even if the page quality is fairly high, this notebook feels cheap. It\u2019s pretty light, and the front cover is pretty flimsy, essentially made of card stock. (Plus it stained really easily.) The size is a standard A5, but for some reason it feels smaller and less substantial to comparably sized bound notebooks. This notebook doesn\u2019t look refined, and there\u2019s not really any features that make it stand out. I do appreciate that the branding is fairly limited, but it comes across as boring rather than clean or minimalist and cool. \u2014MB Total score: 3 $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\n79. Clairefontaine Classic Wirebound Notebook\n\nType: Gridded Design: 3 | Page Quality: 4 | Overall Feel: 3 | The Cover: 2 Compared to the American school kid\u2019s wide-lined composition notebook or five-subject behemoth, this French notebook (originally used by students) is more petite, stylized, and delicate. The pages are printed with the tiniest gridlines that would be impossible to write in. Apparently, this is called French (or Seyes) ruled paper that\u2019s designed for practicing handwriting, with specific rules about how many horizontal lines each letter should cross. Because I was just using it for jotting notes instead of learning how to write properly, I found the lines more distracting than helpful. The paper is smooth and nice to write on, but I felt that without the wider lines that I\u2019m used to, my handwriting was actually more all over the place. It\u2019s small enough to fit in most bags, but not especially durable, as the front and back covers started to look a little creased and scratched after just a few days of regular use. \u2014KIA\ufeff Total score: 3 $5 for 4 at Amazon Buy $5 for 4 at Amazon Buy\n\n80.

I personally prefer the softcover for a notebook like this because it\u2019s easier to spread open and write, and it still feels durable enough for regular use, but it will probably get a bit banged up over time. The paper quality on this was slightly disappointing. It\u2019s not bad, but it doesn\u2019t feel like anything special. Basically just standard-issue white lined paper. And that\u2019s fine. There was a little bleed-through, but overall still a good option for daily use. \u2014DN\ufeff Total score: 3 $15 at Amazon Buy $10 at Barnes and Noble Buy\n\n81.

As for the notebook itself, the soft leather cover is flopsy (unlike, say, a Smythson or Moleskine), which lends it a less formal or stiff quality. While distributed by Discovery Books, the notebook was made by esteemed Italian stationery brand Ciak, so the quality is up to snuff, though I had difficulty getting it to lie flat, and the paper doesn\u2019t feel particularly luxurious. \u2014AS\ufeff Total score: 2.75 $13 at Barnes & Noble Buy\n\n82.

It takes a bit of flattening (I usually put my phone on one page for a few minutes) to make it stay open on a desk, but as its name implies, Field Notes notebooks are really much better suited for someone on the go, rather than a desk-bound office drone.

Paperblanks Grolier Ornamentali Journal\n\nType: Lined $23 (was $27, now 15% off) Design: 3 | Page Quality: 3 | Overall Feel: 3 | The Cover: 1 This is the most compact notebook proportionally that I received \u2014 that came recommended by a New York Public Library gift shop buyer \u2014 but also one of the fattest, with 240 tightly bound pages. It\u2019s smaller-lined pages have 20 lines, with the lines being a bit wider like the Black \u2019N\u2019 Red. Plenty of room for bigger penmanship. The pages are almost too narrow to use as a work and/or school notebook, though; because of how narrow they are, they seem more suited for a diary or a journal. The notebook also has a fancy clasp to close it. (I wrote that it is Harry Potter\u2013core, as it reminds me of Tom Riddle\u2019s diary from The Chamber of Secrets.) It has a red ribbon to mark your page (the hardcover spine cannot be broken to help indicate your place that way). The notebook\u2019s pages are also yellowish \u2014 the brand calls them \u201cacid-free, sustainable forest paper.\u201d They\u2019ve all got a fine border around the edges, so that when you close the book, the pages pressed together show a reddish Baroque pattern (that\u2019s in line with the aesthetic of its embossed cover). The pages are among the least transparent of the notebooks I\u2019ve used (when you turn a page, you really can\u2019t see the writing on the other side). They do smudge a bit, though, but not enough to make a big mess. So the Harry Potter/Mother of Dragons aesthetic isn\u2019t my favorite, but that said, it would look great on a shelf \u2014 like an actual book. \u2014AR\ufeff Total score: 2.5 $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\n84. Leda Art Supply Small Softbound Sketchbook\n\nType: Blank Design: 3 | Page Quality: 2 | Overall Feel: 3 | The Cover: 2 This is just a touch bigger than the Smythson proportionally, with about the same thickness. Its cover is made of a material that feels like rubber \u2014- it\u2019s pleasing to the touch. The brand says the cover is \u201call-weather.\u201d It\u2019s also unlined, which I don\u2019t love, and the pages smudge way more than any of the above notebooks. \u201cVery smudgy,\u201d I wrote. I\u2019m now wondering if that\u2019s because it\u2019s a sketchbook, and if you\u2019re sketching with charcoal or something, maybe you want to be able to blend it lightly? The pages rip out almost seamlessly, but not quite (again, wondering if that has something to do with it being more for sketching?). There\u2019s something a bit drab about this. It\u2019s not that far off from looking like a Moleskine, but the cover is a muddled gray, not pure black, and the rubbery material has a matte effect that\u2019s just like meh. I would be comfortable calling it the most boring on my list. This coupled with its other features I don\u2019t like (namely the smudge pages) made it my least favorite. But I\u2019m an editor, not an artist, so perhaps someone who likes to draw or sketch would like it more than someone who uses predominantly uses notebooks to write. \u2014AR\ufeff Total score: 2.5 $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\n85.

It\u2019s straight-up graph paper, like what your geometry teacher would hand out in middle school. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but for everyday note-taking, the steel-blue lines are a little too dark and make it a little tough to read my handwriting. The pages themselves are smooth for writing and, considering how thin they feel, don\u2019t show much bleed-through from ink. They were comfortable to write on, but I kept getting distracted by those dark graph lines. This notebook feels flimsy. The front and back covers are just glossy paper, with no extra weight, and you can see where the binding comes apart from the pages when you fold it open. Herlitz is a German company that\u2019s known for making school supplies, and boy, does this look like a notebook that belongs in a third-grade classroom.

I could do without the inspirational text on the front and inside cover, but it\u2019s not a deal-breaker. What really got to me, though, was the pagination. The numbering starts on the left-hand side of the notebook, with odd-numbered pages on the left instead of the right, which goes against all principles of book design! I could not get over that. Plus, the paper, which is FSC-certified, has a recycled, scratchy feel \u2014 my fine-tip pen caught when I was writing. There\u2019s no bleed through, however, and the paper has a nice heft.

It\u2019s a larger notebook, so I knew the first time I tried to shove this in my bag, the thin cover would turn on me. Opening it up, I was equally disappointed. The pages are sturdy, but it\u2019s colored graph paper. Between the colored sheets and all the lines, my thoughts were jumbled before I even got them on the page.
