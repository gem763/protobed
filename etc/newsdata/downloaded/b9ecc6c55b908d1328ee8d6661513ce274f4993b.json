Are you falling in love with me?\"", "description": "Boris Johnson is accused of granting public funds and access to foreign trade missions to his \"close friend\" and tech entrepeneur Jennifer Arcuri.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9ae4e1591bb72d6f261d46?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
