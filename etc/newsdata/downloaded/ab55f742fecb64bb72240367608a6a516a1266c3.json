Calls for an established body to be enshrined in the Constitution has been a controversial issue since it was brought to light during the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. Mr Wyatt told Sky News all options were on the table for achieving an Indigenous voice. \u201cOne size does not fit all and that\u2019s why this work is important and I want it to be the foundation stone for the way in which all governments in the future will respond to Indigenous communities about their needs,\" Mr Wyatt said.
