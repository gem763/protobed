Solar panels\n\nIn a car trip recently the gentleman behind the wheel was showing me an app on his phone that showed how much his solar panels were taking off his power bill.\n\nWe chatted about his full set-up with the total cost of 30 panels being something like $14,000, although you can obviously scale that down for your house size and budget.\n\nHe was saving several hundreds of dollars a quarter on his energy bills. The saving wasn\u2019t the feel-good factor for him though, it was knowing he was doing his bit for renewable energy, for his kids and his grandkids, that really lit him up.\n\n3. Floor plan\n\nRight at this moment I\u2019m trying to rejig my downstairs floor plan to make best use of the space.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take moving a few timber stud walls and distributing any load that might be borne by them, and moving some furniture around to make best use of the access to the outdoors.\n\nWith any construction work, though, you can only get predictable prices from thorough and water-tight documentation to send out to tender, but with the arrival of Hi Pages it seems that process is even simpler.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting a fixed price and a clear contract around a defined scope of work allows you the best chance to fit your works within a budget, though it\u2019s always wise to keep 10 to 20 per cent of your budget aside for contingencies or any changes\n\nof heart.\n\n4. Decor\n\nLook at drapery that\u2019s ready-made to bring down the luxury price tag.\n\nIf you want to make your home a true reflection of your personality and a wonderful cocoon of wellbeing to shut out all the troubles of the world, you need to invest in that extra layer.\n\nWhether your desired mood is light and bright, dark and sultry, minimalist or heavily decorated, you need to layer in paint colours, wallpapers, decor and soft furnishings, all of which you can achieve, especially with some DIY prowess and a good eye for a bargain.\n\nSales are wonderful things to get the best bang for your buck.\n\nLook at drapery that\u2019s ready-made to bring down the luxury price tag, but however you piece together your aesthetic, giving it an extra layer will offer a sense of wellbeing that you will find hard to feel anywhere else but home.\n\nThis story first appeared at Domain.\n\ndomain.com.au", "description": "Got 10 grand to spare?
