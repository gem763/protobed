Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they\u2019re not even close.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 \u2014 Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton \u2014 China\u2019s economy could not have caught up to America\u2019s.\n\nEven if the U.S. economy had not grown at all since 2016, China\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of economic output \u2014 would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to pull even with America\u2019s. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year \u2014 something even China\u2019s super-charged economy has never approached.\n\nThe Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America\u2019s. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States. But it\u2019s got a long way to go to surpass the U.S.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe have totally defeated the ISIS caliphate.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: His claim of a 100% defeat is misleading as the Islamic State still poses a threat.\n\nIS was defeated in Iraq in 2017, then lost the last of its land holdings in Syria in March, marking the end of the extremists\u2019 self-declared caliphate.\n\nStill, extremist sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in Iraq and Syria and are believed to be responsible for targeted killings against local officials and members of the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nIS controlled large swaths of northern and eastern Syria, where they declared a caliphate in 2014 along with large parts of neighboring Iraq.\n\nU.N. experts warned in August that IS leaders are aiming to consolidate and create conditions for an \u201ceventual resurgence in its Iraqi and Syrian heartlands.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, explaining his decision to withdraw U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, who are holding thousands of foreign fighters in the campaign against IS: \u201cMost of them came from Europe.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: The foreign fighters captured are not mostly from Europe, which Trump has argued could easily reclaim them.\n\nOf the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. But the bulk of captured fighters \u2014 about 10,000 \u2014 are natives of Syria or Iraq.\n\nTrump has said it will now be up to countries in the region to decide what to do with captured fighters.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Cal Woodward contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Thursday minimized the ongoing threat of the Islamic State and overstated his economic success, declaring", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/9352e0_election-2020-trump-40299-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-arrives-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
