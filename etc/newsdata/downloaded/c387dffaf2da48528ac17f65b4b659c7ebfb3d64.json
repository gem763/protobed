As a well-run, responsible club, that amount will be repaid in full and on time and our other regulatory obligations will be met.\n\n\u201cWe will not apologise for being financially sustainable, but we will push the boundaries of our budgets as far as possible to maximise the impact on the team.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn also said a football club was \u201cmore than just a club, it is an institution at the heart of our communities\u2019, a sentiment with which the Magpies\u2019 hierarchy agrees.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cOften, Newcastle United Foundation\u2019s projects fill in significant gaps that the public sector sadly cannot stretch to, particularly at a time when government cuts are so prevalent.\n\n\u201cWe would like to invite Mr Corbyn to visit one of these initiatives to experience at first hand the incredible work that is being undertaken by the Foundation in our local community every day.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Newcastle\u00a0have hit back at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn after he launched an attack on \u201cbad owners like Mike Ashley\u201d\u00a0as part of a plan to shake up the way football is run.
