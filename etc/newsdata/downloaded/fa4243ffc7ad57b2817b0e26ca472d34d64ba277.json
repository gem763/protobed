Especially, smuggling from California through Korean students and Korean Americans has jumped.\n\nMost seems to have come in by mail order, with 149 cases through direct mail and 77 by express cargo services. Just eight cases were travelers trying to smuggle the pungent substance in their luggage. Numbers are expected to rise since Canada also legalized marijuana last October.\n\nKorean drug laws are tough, and anyone receiving a shipment can be jailed. The KCS pledged to tighten its crackdown on mail and goods shipments from North America.\n\n", "description": "Marijuana Smuggling from U.S. on the Rise", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-05-27"}
