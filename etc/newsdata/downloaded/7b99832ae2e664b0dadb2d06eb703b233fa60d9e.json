The Shelter Boxing workout is a 45 minute 'meditative sweat' which combines boxing and low impact, high intensity conditioning. The Shelter Box class runs as 10 guided rounds, split between the boxing bag and the floor.\n\nGlen recently teamed up with founder of Shelter Ben Mills to launch Shelter Boxing Academy, a boxing training camp at Shelter Gym, a 'non-intimidating' boutique space in Sydney's Double Bay.\n\n'Boxing gives you the ability to 'train like the pros, without the blows',' Glen told FEMAIL.\n\n'Through boxing, you develop speed and strength in your arms, legs and core. Your cardiovascular fitness and coordination are bi-products of the exercise.\n\n'When you're in a boxing studio, you're present and in the moment. It's certainly something that serves as a form of escape from our busy lives.'\n\nBoxing strengthens your arms, legs and core as well as building speed and improving coordination and balance\n\nAsked the age old question about how to tone your stomach, Glen admitted the adage 'abs are made in the kitchen' is largely accurate.\n\n'This is best achieved in the kitchen! If we were to talk about toning stomachs in the gym, keep it simple,' he said.\n\n'Ab wheel roll outs and L-sit hanging raises are best - it doesn't have to be over complicated to be effective.'\n\nWhat a professional MMA fighter eats in a day BREAKFAST A light smoothie of banana, coconut water, sliced mango and protein, OR poached egg on wholemeal toast with half an avocado. 'A high intensity cardio session in the morning before eating anything is a great start,' Glen says. LUNCH Wholemeal salad and poached chicken wrap OR sashimi and brown rice sushi. 'If you dine out for lunch, avoid fried and fatty foods - you'll feel better for it in the afternoon from a fatigue perspective,' Glen advised. DINNER Rice or sweet potato with a white fish. In the lead up to a fight, Glen likes to fuel his body with Italian dishes like pasta.\n\nTo build a toned behind, Glen advised hitting the area directly with exercises that activate the gluteus muscles.\n\n'Progressively adding weights and reps is important to improve tone and growth over time,' he said.\n\nIn terms of toning arms, Glen said it's best to keep it old school with traditional bicep and tricep exercises.\n\nHis favourite full-body workout is spinning, which he tries to fit in three times a week.\n\nGlen believes a mix of disciplines like spinning, boxing and Pilates is the key to maintaining a lean, toned physique\n\n'Three sessions a week is achievable for anyone who allocates time in their day to exercise, he said.\n\n'If I only trained three times a week, I would mix disciplines - for example, boxing, spinning and Pilates.'\n\nGlen said rest and recovery is essential to sustaining an effective fitness routine.\n\n'It's so important for avoiding injury and promoting growth,' he said.", "description": "Professional MMA fighter turned personal trainer Glen Austin, from Sydney, revealed the exact workouts you need to build a booty and tone your stomach just in time for summer.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20060714-0-image-a-2_1571786270566.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
