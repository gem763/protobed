TODAY \u2013 The Government will set out its plan for new laws in the Queen\u2019s Speech. TOMORROW \u2013 EU ministers will meet in Luxembourg, where the outline of a Brexit deal will need to be agreed if it is to be signed off by end of the week. WEDNESDAY \u2013 French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meet in Paris to agree their Brexit stance. THURSDAY/FRIDAY \u2013 Boris Johnson attends a European Council summit in Brussels, where he hopes EU leaders will approve the new deal. SATURDAY \u2013 The Commons meets for the first time on a Saturday since the Falklands War. MPs will vote on a deal if one has been agreed with Brussels. A huge People\u2019s Vote march, protesting against Brexit, is planned in London.\n\nOne senior EU diplomat said: 'It's a kind of Groundhog Day that continues tomorrow on customs.'\n\nAnother added: 'It'll be difficult to have a legal text ready for the summit, but still not impossible if there's some movement.'\n\nA third diplomat said: 'There's momentum but probably not enough time. Negotiations are, as expected, not easy. But they are moving forward.'\n\nEU officials had already privately said there was little chance of reaching a deal in time.\n\nMr Johnson's plan involves creating two customs areas on the island of Ireland, which one senior EU source close to the negotiations described as 'mind-bogglingly' complex.\n\nThey added: 'This requires careful legal work you can't do hastily. That makes it all very tricky.'\n\nThe plan would see Northern Ireland being subject to EU customs tariffs as goods cross the Irish Sea from mainland Britain. But Northern Irish businesses would claim back rebates, meaning it would de facto remain within UK customs jurisdiction.\n\nA meeting of EU foreign ministers will take place tomorrow in Luxembourg, where they ideally want sight of final proposals.\n\nMr Johnson's plan involves creating two customs areas on the island of Ireland, which one senior EU source close to the negotiations described as 'mind-bogglingly' complex\n\nUnder the terms of the so-called Benn Act, Mr Johnson must accept whatever extension is offered by the EU if there is no agreement before October 31.\n\nAny new legal text will have to be translated into all of the bloc's languages and subjected to scrutiny by its legal services.\n\nThe EU parliament must then pass it, where it would have to go through committee hearings before facing a full vote. One EU source said it was 'really unlikely' all these processes could take place by the end of the month.\n\nUK Government spokesman said there had been 'constructive discussions' but that there is still 'a significant amount of work to be done'.", "description": "Michel Barnier told ambassadors that Britain's Irish backstop alternative is still not acceptable - despite concessions from Boris Johnson that were received warmly by Leo Varadkar last week.", "authors": ["David Churchill Brussels Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/22/19668004-0-image-a-15_1571003558032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
