It's finally a sign I belong somewhere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n'MASSIVE IMPACT'\n\nMamo's fate was sealed before she was born when her Christian father and Muslim mother fell in love in Syria. Interfaith marriages were banned so they eloped to neighbouring Lebanon where she, her sister Souad and brother Eddy were born.\n\n\"You can only be Lebanese if your father is Lebanese, and we couldn't be Syrian because our parents' marriage was illegal, so we grew up stateless,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\"It has had a massive impact all my life. I had many challenges every day. I was afraid of every single thing.\"\n\nMamo was rejected by many schools before eventually being accepted by an Armenian school which took pity on the family.\n\nA talented basketball player, she was scouted by professional coaches who believed she had potential to play on the national team - until they realised she had no documents.\n\n\"That was when my world came crashing down,\" she said. \"This was the first moment when the deprivations really hit home. But as a teenager I didn't yet understand how big my problem was.\"\n\nDespite good school grades, her applications to study medicine at university were also rejected.\n\nHealth care was another obstacle. To get urgent hospital treatment for a severe allergy Mamo was forced to pretend to be her best friend.\n\nWith no papers, even the most mundane things became a logistical nightmare.\n\n\"There are simple things you would never imagine that are so impossible; buying a sim card, getting a loan, having a library card or even going to a club to dance with your friends or celebrate a birthday,\" she said.\n\n\"If they ask for ID you have to give up and go home.\"\n\nIn Lebanon, there was the added danger posed by checkpoints.\n\n\"If the police stop you then you are going to jail just because you don't have documents,\" she said.\n\n\"Every time I saw one I had to run the other way just because my existence itself was illegal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW BEGINNING\n\nDesperate for a solution to her predicament, Mamo sent her story to presidents, ministers and any organisation she thought might be able to help - and was met with a wall of silence.\n\nBut in 2014 Brazil offered to take Mamo and her siblings under a new humanitarian visa programme it had launched to help Syrians fleeing war.\n\n\"I went to Brazil not as a stateless person, but as a refugee. I only knew two things about Brazil - the football and the carnival,\" said Mamo, now 31 and fluent in Portuguese.\n\nHer arrival in Brazil coincided with the launch of the United Nations' #Ibelong campaign aimed at ending statelessness in a decade.\n\n\"For me, my brother and sister that was the hope. In 10 years we would have the chance to be a person, a human being,\" said Mamo.\n\nBut she did not have to wait that long. In 2017, Brazil changed its law to recognise stateless people and provide a route to naturalisation.\n\nLast year Mamo and her sister became the first stateless people in Brazil to be granted citizenship.\n\nMamo, who is writing a book about her life, recalls vividly the moment when she was presented with her Brazilian passport - ending 30 years in limbo.\n\n\"I started shaking and crying,\" she said. \"I did not believe what was happening, that this was my moment when I'm born again and my life would totally change.\"", "description": "As a teenager growing up in Lebanon Maha Mamo lived in constant terror of checkpoints, but her only crime was to be born stateless.
