Kate was never a big drinker, she didn't need alcohol to give her confidence.\n\n\"Will was getting really hit on by this girl at the party and it was getting quite uncomfortable because he couldn't shake her off.\n\n\"He was being really polite, but this girl just didn't get the hint.\n\n(Image: Tim Graham/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\n\"All of a sudden Kate came up behind him and put her arms around him.\n\n\"He said 'Oh, sorry, but I've got a girlfriend', and he and Kate went off giggling.\"\n\nWills was very grateful of her help, and according to Laura he mouthed \"thanks so much\" to her afterwards.\n\nShe said: \"Kate was the only girl in the room who could have done that. And that was just a month after we started university.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just William who was a big hit with the opposite sex while at university, and Kate had her fair share of admirers.\n\n(Image: Barcroft Media)\n\nAccording to Laura she was often asked out by boys in their halls or on her course as she was \"very striking and beautiful\" and \"bubbly and open\".\n\nAnd while she wasn't interested in most of the potential suiters who tried to date her, fourth-year law student Rupert Finch did catch her eye.\n\nPal Michael Choong said: \"All the blokes loved Kate and all the girls loved Rupert. They were a golden couple.\n\n\"He would have crazy parties at his house, and all-night drinking sessions following nights at Ma Bells, when the vodka bottles came out.\"", "description": "Kate Middleton and Prince William were good friends at university and used to look out for each other on nights out in the student bars", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Clarence House Via Gettyimages", "Getty Images", "Tim Graham Getty Images", "Rex Features", "Barcroft Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641998.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Middleton-Family-Release-Images-Of-Kate-Middleton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
