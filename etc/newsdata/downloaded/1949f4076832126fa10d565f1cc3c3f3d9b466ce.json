We've heard every excuse under the sun. Procrastination is a habit, and if you understand how it shows up for you, you can replace it with a better one.\n\nHere are two clients' examples:\n\nBrian called in to his weekly accountability call one morning exhausted and disappointed. He had gotten everything he committed to done. But he'd stayed up all night to do it. Although this habit worked well when he was single and doing contract work on his own schedule, now as a successful consultant, husband, and father, he was ready to make a change.\n\nOur client Melinda is at the top of her game: accomplished, polished, and the CEO of a successful marketing company. While she would never claim the title of procrastinator, she had shiny object syndrome and couldn't finish a project without starting a new one.\n\nHow can highly-driven and accomplished people still be such procrastinators?\n\nLet's be real: We can all fall into this trap. As accountability coaches we've learned that what works for Brian doesn't necessarily work for Melinda.\n\nIn our experience, everyone has a favorite avoidance archetype. The key to defeating delay is figuring out which group you fall into so you can break out of your holding pattern and get the project done early, for once.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the procrastination personality types and how to retrain your brain to finally get any dreaded task done.\n\n1. The performer who says, \"I work well under pressure\"\n\nThis procrastinator forces themselves to focus by shrinking the time they have to tackle a task. For many of our clients, the real reason behind this is perfectionism. If you're tight on time, there's no way the task can be done to your unreasonably high standards anyway, right? For others, the issue is simply falling back into old patterns and beliefs that we have about our 11th-hour saves. No matter what, being in the habit of putting pressure on yourself is not sustainable.\n\nYour biggest challenge: Getting started.\n\nYour solution: Flip the script and set a start date. When you focus on when you're going to begin a task \u2014 and not when you hope to end it \u2014 you'll take a tremendous amount of pressure off of yourself.\n\n2. The self-deprecator who says, \"I am so lazy right now\"\n\n\n\nThis procrastinator is the opposite of lazy, so when they don't do something they are extra hard on themselves. We see this a lot with our male clients. They tend to blame inaction on laziness or stubbornness rather than admit they are tired. What they really need is to be more compassionate with themselves.\n\nYour biggest challenge: Taking a break. We already know you are going to say you don't have time to rest.\n\nYour solution: Recharge. Try taking a walk to give yourself space and to begin to rebuild your energy.\n\n3. The overbooker who says, \"I'm so busy\"\n\nThis procrastinator is a pro at filling up their calendar and is often overwhelmed. \"I'm so busy\" is probably the excuse we hear most often. Interestingly, some of the busiest people we work with get the most done. When busy-ness comes up as an excuse for not doing something, it's usually an indication of avoidance. Rather than facing a challenge head on or admitting they don't want to do something, it's easier to place the blame on having other important things to do.\n\nYour biggest challenge: Creating chaos to avoid facing what you know you need to face right now (typically this is not a task).\n\nYour solution: Take a moment of introspection. Ask yourself: What am I really avoiding?\n\n4. The novelty seeker who says, \"I just had the best idea!\"\n\nThis procrastinator has a terminal case of Shiny Object Syndrome. They're constantly coming up with new projects to take on \u2014 and then getting bored with them a week later. They're intrigued by the latest trend and will be quick to implement but not follow through.\n\nThey are great at making decisions and taking action. However, they end up inadvertently losing a lot of time and burning out because they don't take consistent action in one direction long enough to see results. Many of our entrepreneurial clients fit into this category.\n\nYour biggest challenge: Completion.\n\nYour solution: Make it stick. Literally. Write down new ideas or projects on a sticky note \u2014 but don't pursue them until you finish what you are currently working on.\n\nAli Schiller and Marissa Boisvert are the co-owners of Accountability Works\u00ae, a mindfulness-based coaching company that helps highly-driven professionals accomplish their goals without sacrificing their health.
