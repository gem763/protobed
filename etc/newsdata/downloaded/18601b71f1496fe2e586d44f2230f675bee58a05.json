In the last week, an anonymous whistleblower\u2019s allegation that President Trump repeatedly pressed the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden has gone public, and the expanding congressional probe into those claims is forming the basis of an official impeachment inquiry from House Democrats.\n\nThe delegation is the first group of U.S. lawmakers to travel to Ukraine since early September, before any details of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint were publicly known.\n\nThe Democratic committee aide affirmed the trip is unrelated to the current Ukraine news, and said that lawmakers are heading there to perform oversight over the U.S. military\u2019s European area of command, or EUCOM. The aide declined to go into more detail about the trip.\n\nOf course, a key detail of the Trump-Ukraine saga falls under the purview of Armed Services Committee members: the Trump administration sat on $250 million in security assistance to the country\u2014which has been sent without incident for each of the last four years\u2014while the president and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressed the newly-elected administration of Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. After bipartisan outcry, the administration suddenly released the aid on Sept. 12.\n\nWhether or not the security aid was the center of a quid-pro-quo arrangement sought by Trump remains a key question in Democrats\u2019 investigation. Lawmakers on the House Appropriations and Budget Committees sent letters to the administration last Friday demanding a full explanation of how and why the funds were withheld.", "description": "The trip has been in the works for some time, but the political climate is now radically different than it was even a week ago.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2752,w_4893,x_0,y_381/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569872131/RTX74AI9_v8ngp4", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
