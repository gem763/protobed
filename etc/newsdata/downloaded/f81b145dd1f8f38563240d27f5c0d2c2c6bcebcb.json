The oxygen was sucked out of a new century\u2019s \u00e9lan. Something crimped took its place. Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, tells me he was practicing law in California when the attack happened. That day he decided he wanted to go into public service. He sent an application to the F.B.I. and soon found his way to a job at what was then the United States Customs Service. \u201cThis is why I was called to serve,\u201d he says.\n\nMcAleenan is a candid, no-nonsense, energetic guy who is trying, I believe, to bring some order at the southern border consistent with America\u2019s spirit as a nation of immigrants and its foundation as a nation of laws. Least-bad solutions are out of favor in a country of howling politicized factions, but there is no other kind for the mess at the border. The antidote to the brutality and xenophobia that have stained America\u2019s conscience is not throwing America\u2019s doors wide open.\n\nIn the five months since his appointment, McAleenan has traveled several times to Central America, where the root of the problem lies. Apprehensions at the southwest border have fallen steeply since May. Children are no longer being ripped from their parents. McAleenan is a welcome restraint on the worst anti-immigrant instincts of the Trump Administration.\n\nOf course, he\u2019s still \u201cacting.\u201d Every Homeland Security business card I received from the secretary\u2019s aides had the word \u201cacting\u201d on it. The president likes to instill fear, change course. Acting is Trump\u2019s thing.\n\nThere is the man, and then there is the country. Myriad people still come to the United States, seeking work, dignity, possibility, education and the protection of the law. Something endures that is commensurate to their \u201ccapacity for wonder.\u201d To underestimate that America, even if the country is unhealed, would be a mistake.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
