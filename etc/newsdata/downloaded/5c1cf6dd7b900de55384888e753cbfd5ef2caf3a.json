Why isn\u2019t that a massive negative for Volkswagen in terms of its corporate governance?\n\n\u201cSomeone had to know about it. Someone had to write the cheques or pass it through the electronic banking system.\"\n\nWhen Jeremy Kirk, SC, appearing for the ACCC, told him that settlements needed compromise, the judge fired back \"you don't have to agree with things that are completely wrong\".\n\nHe also said it was unclear why the settlement penalty needed to be \"far less\" than the ACCC would have got had they won at trial.\n\nWhile settlements from regulators require court approval, judges do not usually overrule agreed penalties. Justice Foster said the penalty was up to him to decide, however.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking abroad\n\nThe cheating allegations put forward by the ACCC were mirrored in civil and criminal actions overseas and VW tried to convince Justice Foster that penalties imposed abroad should be considered in any Australian fine.\n\nA US Federal Court judge hit Volkswagen with a $US2.8 billion ($4.1 billion) criminal fine in 2017 after finding the automaker rigged emissions testing to cheat government emissions testing.\n\nThis brought the total penalties paid by Volkswagen in the US to over $US25 billion, as it had already been ordered to pay compensation to drivers among other fines.\n\nVolkswagen was also hit with a \u20ac1 billion ($1.61 billion) fine in Germany and one of its executives, Oliver Schmidt, copped a $US400,000 penalty in the US and a seven-year jail sentence.\n\n\"The financial pain or consequences of the underlying wrongdoing that led to these contraventions has already been subject to financial penalty elsewhere ... we ask Your Honour to consider that,\" Garry Rich, SC, said for Volkswagen.\n\nJustice Foster responded by accusing him of only providing selective information about other fines.\n\n\"Am I being told that the US fines and these [Australian] fines are the only ones in the world being imposed? Are these selectively chosen, am I just being given select press releases?\" he asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What am I supposed to make of this, that this is just another fine? There's going to be a lot of them.\n\nHe accepted the ACCC's case that fines abroad should not be considered, but then threw that back in Mr Kirk's face when the barrister tried to argue that the \"unprecedented\" $75 million penalty was appropriate as it far exceeded previous ACCC fines.\n\n\"That doesn\u2019t matter. You've spent some time telling me I shouldn't be influenced by other countries and cases and I agree with that. This is so out there on its own in terms of scale, impact, deliberateness [that] I don\u2019t really think pointing me to any other case is going to help me.\"\n\nAudi goes under ACCC's radar\n\nThe initial charges brought by the ACCC, as well as cases abroad and domestic class actions, also named Audi as party to 'dieselgate'.\n\nBut the ACCC and Volkswagen settlement made no mention of them, which Justice Foster was quick to criticise.\n\n\"It would be the submission of the parties that I could not ... take into account the Audi vehicles affected by this penalty at all,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr Kirk responded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm nonetheless entitled to comment on them ... just not take it into account in the penalty,\" the judge warned.\n\nMr Kirk admitted the Audi cars were \"wrapped up in some scandal\" but suggested the ACCC needed to prioritise its attention to Volkswagen.\n\nThe class action brought against Volkswagen and Audi domestically settled for settled last month for $87-127 million and no admission of guilt from the automakers.", "description": "A Federal Court judge has thrashed the watchdog for going too easy on Volkswagen for cheating emissions testing, saying Australians would be \"very upset\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c8c276465aaed53bf060e60b068eda2069a693e8", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
