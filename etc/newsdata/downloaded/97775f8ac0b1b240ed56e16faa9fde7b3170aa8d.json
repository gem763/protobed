It had not secured any cornerstone investors in its June IPO attempt.\n\nCLSA and Deutsche Bank are joint sponsors for the IPO.\n\nESR was formed in 2016 by the merger of the Japan-centric Redwood Group and China-focused e-Shang, co-founded by Warburg Pincus in 2011.\n\nIts shares will be priced on Oct. 25 and trading is scheduled to start on Nov. 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIPO activity picks up\n\nESR's float will be among a clutch of recent listings seen as tests of investor sentiment in Hong Kong that has been roiled by a five-month long political crisis.\n\nHaving topped the global charts in 2018 for funds raised through IPOs, Hong Kong is currently lagging behind both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq with $US18.5 billion raised as of mid-October, Refinitiv data showed. That compared with $US21.9 billion on the NYSE and $US23.3 billion on Nasdaq.\n\nBut IPO activity in the city has picked up, marked by the September relaunch by AB InBev's Asia-Pacific unit.\n\nBudweiser Brewing Company APAC raised about $US5 billion in Hong Kong's biggest and the world's second-largest IPO so far this year.\n\nIt had cancelled a plan for a bigger float in July citing \"several factors, including the prevailing market conditions\".\n\nAmong other planned listings, JS Global Lifestyle, on Monday launched a Hong Kong IPO of as much as $US464 million, according to a marketing term sheet seen by Reuters.\n\nBacked by Chinese private-equity firm CDH Investments, JS Global is selling about 500 million shares with an indicative price band of $HK5.55 to $HK7.25 per share.\n\nJS Global did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nReuters", "description": "Private equity-backed property fund manager and investor ESR, which also has exposure in the Australian market, is looking to float in Hong Kong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a4b1e787cd3c7c5ac493a48eca02a55fea889e3f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
