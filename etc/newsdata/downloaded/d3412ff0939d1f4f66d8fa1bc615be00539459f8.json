Managing Partner, Robin Lokhorst comments, \u201cWe all share a commitment to making a positive impact in our communities and this historic building is just one more way we are doing that\u201d.\n\nMcLeod Law is helping preserve part of Alberta\u2019s history for future generations.\n\nThe law office symbolizes Alberta\u2019s economic boom of the early 1900s. High River\u2019s first lawyer, James Varley, worked out of this building in 1904 and, in 1908, native Manitoban, Alexander McCorquodale ran his legal career out of the building for 40 years. Mr. McCorquodale\u2019s practice focused on real estate law which is one of the founding areas of McLeod Law. The Calgary Bar Association donated the building in 1967 to Heritage Park and was fully restored 30 years later.\n\nAbout McLeod Law LLP\n\nWe\u2019re in the business of helping people, and that will never change. McLeod Law LLP opened its doors in 1980 as a two-person operation.
