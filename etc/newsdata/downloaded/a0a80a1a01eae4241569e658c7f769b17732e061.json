(The final straw? \u201cLolllllll no one likes you.\u201d) But all that came to a head when Donald Trump himself randomly called her out \u2014 in a subtweet, no less! The president tapped out a thread condemning \u201cboring musician\u201d John Legend\u2019s \u201cfilthy mouthed wife,\u201d while discussing an MSNBC criminal-justice-reform special that Chrissy had nothing to do with. When she found out through friends, her \u201cheart stopped,\u201d but because she\u2019s the internet\u2019s cool girl, Chrissy simply volleyed it right back. \u201cThose two things are true,\u201d she admitted on The Ellen Degeneres Show. \u201cJohn is boring. I do have a filthy mouth.\u201d The thing is, she knows how to use it. \u201cWe spent the entire rest of the night sitting next to each other handing each other our phone,\u201d she recalled her back and forth with John. \u201c\u2018Should I say this? Should I say this? No. Should I say this? No. No, it has to be funnier. No. No, \u2019cause we\u2019re mad. Yeah, we\u2019re mad!\u2019\u201d Even though she more or less won with #PresidentPussyAssBitch, the real win was the friends she made along the way. \u201cYou realize why you love Twitter and you love your friends,\u201d she said. \u201cI had so many group chats going that night of just hilarious people and people making funny videos, sending \u2019em to me. So, then you laugh about it.\u201d\n\nRelated", "description": "On \u2018The Ellen Show,\u2019 Chrissy Teigen explains how she reacted to Donald Trump\u2019s mean tweet about her.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/11-chrissy-teigen.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
