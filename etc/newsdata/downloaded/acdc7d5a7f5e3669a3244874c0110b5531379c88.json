(Carlo Allegri/Reuters)\n\nFor months, fans of Kanye West have followed a burgeoning project behind the scenes of the rapper\u2019s life \u2014 so-called \u201cSunday Services.\u201d \u201cI had the idea of making a church before but I really was sketching it out. Then in 2019, I was like \u2018I\u2019m not letting a Sunday go by without making this,\u2019\u201d West said on his family\u2019s reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs these performances have gradually become open to the public, they\u2019ve been met with mixed reviews in Christian circles. While some groups are praising him for reaching unchurched young people with his music, others argue that he doesn\u2019t understand the gospel, that his foray into the genre is simply an ugly manifestation of egotism.\n\nBack in April, when the shows were still in their early stages, Kim Kardashian, West\u2019s wife, said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that \u201cthere\u2019s no praying, there\u2019s no sermon, no word, just music, and just a feeling \u2014 and it\u2019s Christian.\u201d Then West met Adam Tyson, the pastor of a small California-based Bible Church a grad student at The Master\u2019s Seminary, and the concerts took on a more-explicitly-religious tenor. \u201cTyson said he has directly told Kanye that Sunday Service concerts are not church, because they do not include ordained leadership, the sacraments or often the Word preached. So Kanye invited him to preach at the last two services,\u201d Christianity Today reported.\n\nBut the backlash is building just as West\u2019s latest album, Jesus Is King, approaches release. At West\u2019s latest performance, in a historically black church in Queens, some regular congregants walked out shaking their heads. One critic in the Daily Beast compared the experience to a slave-training session led by a white pastor (Tyson) worshipping select scripture provided to keep the congregants in line. Another asked whether West is exploiting religion to sell Sunday Service merchandise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut such reviews are far from a consensus. The reality is, many pastors have preached at these \u201cSunday Services,\u201d including Carl Lentz, pastor of Hillsong New York, and Rich Wilkerson, who held services at West\u2019s wedding. The shows have attracted dozens of celebrities, including Travis Scott, Chance the Rapper, Justin Bieber, Jaden Smith, Brad Pitt, Katy Perry, and Orlando Bloom, not to mention their fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRap music is sometimes associated with decadence, philandering, and violence. But over the last decade, artists such as Logic, Chance the Rapper, and West have broadened the medium and grown as artists. Now West is saying he\u2019s no longer making secular music, and some believers close to him vouch that he truly is a born-again Christian. While his understanding of the gospel may be lacking, if West is truly seeking truth, he might find it \u2014 and so may the fans who\u2019ve come along for the ride.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article has been revised since its initial publication.", "description": "On the eve of his new album, some say he\u2019s self-interested, while others are optimistic he will help the gospel reach the masses.", "authors": ["William Z.
