Free in an unruly way, but free\".\n\nThe boy tugged on the gloved hand of a Swiss Guard and played behind Francis's chair.\n\n\"Give me a kiss,\" the pontiff said, as the boy's mother rushed on stage to try and catch him, before Francis told her to let him be.\n\n\"We should all ask ourselves, am I as free in the face of God?
