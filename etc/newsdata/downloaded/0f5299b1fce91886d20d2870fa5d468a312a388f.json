Rapper Drake used the hook in one of his own recordings, which Daniels talked to Parle Magazine about last year.\n\n\"I think as a writer, one of my proudest moments are when I hear the newer artist that's popping, great and respected, sample a song that I worked on,\" Daniels said. \"Then when they mention you on Instagram, it becomes 'Wow! I didn't even know y'all dug into credits like that.'\"\n\nDaniels found love with his wife April, a hair stylist and clothing designer, and they had three sons together.\n\nThe pair were regulars on the 2012 WE reality series \"Tamar & Vince\" featuring their close friends singer Tamar Braxton and her then husband, record executive Vincent Herbert.\n\nIn 2013, Daniels was nominated for Grammy for his work on Braxton's single \"Love and War.\"\n\nHe had a great love for gospel music and last year released his debut album as a solo artist, \"The Big Shiz Project.\"\n\nNews of Daniel's death was greeted Wednesday with an outpouring of grief from the music industry on Twitter.\n\nThe entire music community is feeling the loss of one of the greatest to ever do it.....
