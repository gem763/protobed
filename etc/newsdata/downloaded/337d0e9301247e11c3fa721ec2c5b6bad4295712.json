The two men, largely forgotten today, were the most successful \u2014 and cruelest \u2014 domestic slave traders in American history. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nThe two most ruthless domestic slave traders in America had a secret language for their business.\n\nSlave trading was a \u201cgame.\u201d The men, Isaac Franklin and John Armfield, were daring \u201cpirates\u201d or \u201cone-eyed men,\u201d a euphemism for their penises. The women they bought and sold were \u201cfancy maids,\u201d a term signifying youth, beauty and potential for sexual exploitation \u2014 by buyers or the traders themselves.\n\nRapes happened often.\n\n\u201cTo my certain knowledge she has been used & that smartly by a one eyed man about my size and age, excuse my foolishness,\u201d Isaac Franklin\u2019s nephew James \u2014 an employee and his uncle\u2019s protege \u2014 wrote in typical business correspondence, referring to Caroline Brown, an enslaved woman who suffered repeated rape and abuse at James\u2019s hands for five months. She was 18 at the time and just over five feet tall.\n\nFranklin and Armfield, who headquartered their slave trading business in a townhouse that still stands in Alexandria, Va., sold more enslaved people, separated more families and made more money from the trade than almost anyone else in America. Between the 1820s and 1830s, the two men reigned as the \u201cundisputed tycoons\u201d of the domestic slave trade, as Smithsonian Magazine put it.\n\nAs the country marks the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in Jamestown, Americans are being forced to confront the brutality of slavery and of the people who profited from it. Few profited more than the two Virginia slave traders.\n\nTheir success was immense: The duo amassed a fortune worth several billions in today\u2019s dollars and retired as two of the nation\u2019s wealthiest men, according to Joshua Rothman, a professor of history at the University of Alabama who is writing a book on Franklin and Armfield. Several factors set the pair apart, Rothman explained: For one thing, their timing was impeccable. They got into the domestic slave trade just as the cotton economy \u2014 and American demand for enslaved labor \u2014 exploded, and quit right before the United States sank into the financial panic of 1837.\n\nTheir location was also prime, perched so they could collect enslaved people from plantations across Virginia and Maryland and sending them on forced marches \u2014 in groups of several hundred known as \u201ccoffles\u201d \u2014 or on tightly packed ships along the Atlantic Coast to the Deep South. While their business strategy was not especially innovative, it was conducted on a scale \u201cbigger and better than anyone else,\u201d Rothman said. Franklin and Armfield transported an estimated 10,000 enslaved people over the course of their careers, according to Rothman.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who turned the business of selling humans from one part of the U.S. to another ... into a very modern, organized business \u2014 no longer just one trader who might move a few people from one plantation to another,\u201d said Maurie D. McInnis, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the cultural history of slavery. \u201cThey created a modern machinery to support the business of human trafficking.\u201d\n\nThat was possible largely because of the traders\u2019 willingness to be unusually cruel and heartless \u2014 even for a business built around the sale of human beings \u2014 as they committed atrocities they appeared to relish.\n\n[As plantations talk more honestly about slavery, some visitors are pushing back]\n\n\u201cIn surviving correspondence, they actually brag about raping enslaved people who they\u2019ve been processing through the firm,\u201d said Calvin Schermerhorn, a professor of history at Arizona State University. \u201cThis seemed to be as much a part of Franklin and Armfield\u2019s culture of business as, say, going to the bar after a successful court case might be the culture of a successful law firm\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nYet today, almost no one knows their names.\n\nWhen Franklin and Armfield retired, they passed easily into elite white society, achieving respectable dotage without a murmur. History, too, has largely \u201clet them off scot-free,\u201d Schermerhorn said. Few, if any, American high school or college students ever learn about the duo.\n\n\u201cI think America continues to be uncomfortable talking about the original sin of slavery,\u201d McInnis said. \u201cAnd this is one of its most horrific chapters.\u201d\n\n\u2018The whole thing was so evil\u2019\n\nThe slave trade was all Isaac Franklin ever knew.\n\nHe was born in 1789 to a wealthy planter family in Tennessee that owned \u201ca significant number\u201d of enslaved people, according to Rothman. In his late teens, right around the time the United States passed a law barring the transatlantic slave trade, Franklin and his older brothers grew interested in the domestic version: They began transporting small numbers of enslaved people between Virginia and the Deep South.\n\nFranklin developed a taste for the business and, after taking a brief break to fight in the War of 1812, dedicated himself to slave trading full-time. It was all he did for the rest of his professional life, right up until he retired.\n\n\u201cHis brothers never got back into the slave trade, but Isaac really decides this is going to be his game: He\u2019s good at it, he likes it, he can make money at it, he sticks with it,\u201d Rothman said.\n\n\n\nThe exterior of the Franklin and Armfield Slave Office, today the Freedom House Museum, in Alexandria. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nFranklin worked with a few partners over the years but connected with his longest-lasting collaborator \u2014 the man who became his closest friend, confidant and nephew by marriage \u2014 in the early 1820s. At the time, John Armfield was lacking in purpose: Shiftless and footloose, he had recently been chased away from a county in North Carolina for fathering a child out of wedlock, Rothman said.\n\nHis path to the slave trade was less clear-cut than Franklin\u2019s. Born in 1797 to lapsed Quakers who farmed several hundred acres in North Carolina and owned a small number of enslaved people, Armfield spent his early adulthood pursuing a variety of unsuccessful ventures, including a small mercantile shop \u2014 which he was forced to abandon after his affair.\n\nThough unsure what he wanted to do, Armfield was clear on what he didn\u2019t: He loathed farming. So, \u201cfloundering about\u201d in the wake of the sex scandal, Armfield decided he would \u201cjust dabble in the slave trade,\u201d according to Rothman.\n\nFranklin and Armfield met a few years after that in the course of business and immediately developed a rapport, Rothman said \u2014 an intimacy that continued for decades and fueled their profitability. In 1834, the two men became family when Armfield married Franklin\u2019s niece.\n\n\u201cThey are each other\u2019s closest friends and that\u2019s rooted in their working relationship,\u201d Rothman said. \u201cPart of the reason they\u2019re successful is they work well together: Each understands the other\u2019s strengths, they trust and respect each other.\u201d\n\n[\u2018We cannot be forgetting\u2019: Twilight marchers in Alexandria evoke the pain of enslaved thousands]\n\nThe two men launched the slave trading firm Franklin & Armfield and moved into the Alexandria townhouse \u2014 today a museum \u2014 in 1828. From the beginning, they divvied the work according to each man\u2019s strength: Armfield, based in Virginia, managed the \u201cbuying side of things\u201d and arranged transportation, Rothman said. Franklin, meanwhile, stayed mostly in Natchez, Miss., and was responsible for selling their human cargo to plantations in the Deep South.\n\nIt worked like this: Relying on a network of headhunters spread across Virginia, Maryland and the District, Armfield would round up enslaved people, holding them in an open-air pen behind the house in Alexandria \u2014 or sometimes in its crowded, filthy basement \u2014 until he\u2019d amassed a sufficient number: usually between 100 and 200. Then, he\u2019d send the group on an arduous 1,000-mile march to slave markets in Natchez or New Orleans \u2014 or he\u2019d stuff them into one of the company\u2019s three massive ships to make the same journey by water.\n\nAt the peak of their business, the two men were moving roughly 1,000 people a year, historians said.\n\n\n\nAn exhibit of business items belonging to Franklin and Armfield at the Freedom House Museum in 2017. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThey placed ads in local newspapers seeking enslaved people almost every single day they remained in business. They developed cruel stratagems to boost their bottom line: For example, they \u201cdesignated less space per person [on their ships] than the trans-Atlantic slave trade vessels did,\u201d Schermerhorn said.\n\nWhile enslaved people waited in Franklin and Armfield\u2019s \u201cholding pen\u201d in Alexandria, the two men most likely adopted classic techniques employed by slave traders to enhance enslaved people\u2019s salability, McInnis said. That meant feeding their captives large amounts of corn pone and pork to \u201cfatten them up,\u201d dying gray hair black \u201cso they looked younger,\u201d and \u2014 if an enslaved person\u2019s skin was scarred with whip marks \u2014 smearing wax into the wounds \u201cso they looked healthier,\u201d according to McInnis.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing was so evil,\u201d McInnis said.\n\nThrough it all, both regularly raped the women they bought and sold and joked about it in letters, a shared habit that deepened their friendship. Franklin and Armfield each fathered at least one child with an enslaved woman, Rothman said. He suspects the abuse, which had no financial purpose, stemmed from a desire for raw power: \u201cThey did it because they could, and they felt like it.\u201d\n\nWhen Franklin wed a rich socialite in 1839, he had been \u201craping the same enslaved woman\u201d for about five years and had fathered a child with her, Rothman said. Franklin sold the enslaved woman and her baby right after his wedding.\n\nHer fate is unknown.\n\n[\u2018My mother was sold from me\u2019: After slavery, the desperate search for loved ones in \u2018last seen ads\u2019]\n\n\u2018No indication \u2026 they felt guilty\u2019\n\nOne of the most persistent misconceptions about slavery in the United States is that the white upper class refused to associate with slave traders on principle, Rothman said \u2014 a myth the case of Franklin and Armfield disproves.\n\nEven while actively trading slaves, the two men enjoyed an excellent reputation and moved in top-tier social circles, according to Rothman. Franklin went to the theater with other rich whites and threw dinner parties, earning a reputation as a \u201cgregarious\u201d host with \u201cthe best liquors,\u201d Rothman said.\n\nArmfield may have been less extroverted, but he, too, drew accolades for his social graces. When visitors came to the Alexandria townhouse, he always opened the door for them, made elegant small talk and offered them something \u201cnice\u201d to drink, McInnis said.\n\n\n\nNow a museum, this townhouse was used to house enslaved people before they were transported to the South. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nHe was so smooth he managed to impress even a New England abolitionist who visited Alexandria in the 1830s. The abolitionist, knowing full well Armfield\u2019s profession, nonetheless wrote: He is \u201ca man of fine personal appearance, and of engaging and graceful manners.\u201d\n\nTheir good reputations persisted after retirement. Franklin and Armfield quit the business around 1837. Franklin, who was approaching his 50s, \u201cwas tired and didn\u2019t want to do it anymore,\u201d Rothman said. Armfield had no wish to continue without his longtime partner.\n\nFranklin divided his retirement between a large mansion he built in Tennessee and several Louisiana plantations he acquired over the course of his career. He whiled away his final years managing his estates and spending time with his three children and wife, Adelicia Hayes, whom records indicate he adored. Franklin died in 1846 of intestinal issues.\n\nArmfield, meanwhile, purchased an old hotel in the Tennessee mountains and converted it to a luxury summer getaway for the wealthy. He ran it with great success in his final years, earning visits from \u201cvery prominent people,\u201d including archbishops and the mayor of Nashville, according to Rothman. (Armfield\u2019s hotel, which still stands, is used to host events including Methodist retreats.) He died of old age in 1871.\n\nArmfield\u2019s marriage never yielded any children, and Franklin\u2019s children with Hayes all died without producing offspring, according to Rothman, so the two men have no direct white descendants living today. Armfield has at least one direct black descendant, Rodney Williams, who wrote about his heritage \u2014 which he said he discovered through DNA testing \u2014 in an essay included in \u201cSlavery\u2019s Descendants,\u201d published in May.\n\nA group of Franklin\u2019s indirect white descendants learned of their relationship to the slave trader a few years ago and, in 2018, donated money and relics to the Alexandria museum located where their ancestor\u2019s business once stood.\n\nNeither Franklin nor Armfield earned recrimination from their peers during their lifetimes \u2014 and neither man felt the slightest remorse, according to their papers.\n\n\u201cIt never occurs to them to think slavery might be bad: Slavery is what made their society work, it made them rich, it was a given that that was what black people were for,\u201d Rothman said. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication anywhere in the record that they felt guilty over what they did.\u201d\n\nRothman is one of a small handful now fighting to remember the two men who arguably served as the founding fathers of America\u2019s domestic slave trade. He became interested in Franklin and Armfield after perceiving a relative paucity of books or articles about the duo \u2014 what he called \u201ca gaping hole in all of the literature on the slave trade.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been six years since Rothman began his research, crisscrossing the country to scour old documents such as property transactions in Louisiana, court cases in Mississippi, ship manifests in Alexandria.\n\nSometimes, he finds it difficult to keep going. He is loath to spend yet another day probing the dark activities and darker minds of Franklin and Armfield.\n\nThen he remembers why he wanted to write the book.\n\n\u201cPeople are still talking about how the slave trade was marginal, slave traders were these ostracized dirtbags, and slaveholders only bought and sold people when they had to,\u201d Rothman said. \u201cThose kinds of stubborn myths \u2014 they need demolition.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nAaron Burr \u2014 villain of \u2018Hamilton\u2019 \u2014 had a secret family of color, new research shows\n\nShe was captured and enslaved 400 years ago.
