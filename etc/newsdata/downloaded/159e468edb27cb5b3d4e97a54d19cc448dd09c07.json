Measured by religious attendance, they are the least churched of American adults. That much of the \u201csecular young people\u201d story is true.\n\nBut religious attendance ebbs and then flows across the life cycle, falling when you leave home and then increasing with child rearing and with the encroachment of mortality. And when the political scientist Ryan Burge recently compared weekly church attendance among today\u2019s 20-somethings to weekly attendance among 20-somethings in the 1990s, he actually found a tiny increase: Church attendance has been falling among the middle-aged and early-elderly cohorts, but the typical millennial or Gen Z American is slightly more likely to be a weekly churchgoer than a Generation-Xer circa 1995.\n\nSo any recent secularization may reflect the aging-and-dying of the more pious Silent Generation, and their replacement in the 60- to 70-year-old cohort by boomers, as much as it reflects the sudden de-Christianization of the young. In which case the \u201cshock\u201d of de-Christianization in the 1960s and 1970s, the years of boomer young adulthood, is arguably still more important to our present situation than the millennial \u201caftershock.\u201d Boomers kept identifying with the churches they had drifted from, while their millennial children dropped the residual identification. But it was the boomer embrace of religious individualism that really determined the country\u2019s spiritual trajectory, not some unique millennial apostasy.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ross Douthat", "Nytimes.Com Opinion American-Christianity.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
