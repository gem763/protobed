Among the reasons cited for their removal was that the children spoke their mother Jelena\u2019s native language Russian at home, not Dutch.\n\nSocial workers also claimed their mother might flee with them to Latvia to escape the children\u2019s estranged father.\n\nThe children had \u201cseverely conflicting loyalties\u201d to their parents, social workers who were working closely with their father said.\n\nThe children had previously said they were frightened of their father and did not want to see him again.\n\nThe original care order was instituted for a year but was subsequently extended on several occasions.\n\nMs Antonova alleges that the children were held without the right legal permission.\n\nThe Dutch Court of Appeal made repeated rulings that the children should be reunited with their mother but these were overturned when the child protection board, part of the justice ministry, sought the extension of the care order in a lower family court.\n\nThe family\u2019s case was first highlighted by the late Christopher Booker in a series of columns for The Sunday Telegraph.\n\nThe case was also raised in the European parliament in March 2014. MEPs were shown a video of the children being taken away from their home, captured by their brother Ilja Antonovs.\n\nThe children were eventually permanently reunited with their mother in November 2014 after two years and eight months when a judge ruled that they should never have been removed from their mother\u2019s care.\n\nThe order followed a report from a family psychologist Dr De Jong who concluded that Ms Antonova was not guilty of neglect.\n\nJelena Antonova was subsequently granted permission to question, under oath, social workers who handled the case and officials from two different authorities connected to the children\u2019s care.\n\nOn June 18 and September 2 Ms Antonova questioned social workers and is now preparing to sue three parties linked to the ordeal; Salvation Army Youth Protection, the Ministry of Justice and Security and the youth protection service of Gelderland province.\n\nDuring the questioning, a number of flaws in the conduct of youth care emerged, the family claims. They are now suing the three parties for the \u201cunlawful and careless removal of the children\u201d, claiming they are liable \u201cfor the damage suffered and to be suffered\u201d by the family.\n\nYouth Protection said it is prohibited from commenting on individual cases. The Netherlands Salvation Army said it does not respond to individual cases but pointed out that Salvation Army Youth Protection always acts under the instruction of the Dutch legal authorities.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice and Security and Gelderland youth protection did not respond to repeated requests for comment this week.", "description": "A mother who says her two children were wrongfully taken into care shortly after their ninth birthday by Dutch social services intends to launch legal action against the authorities who handled the case.
