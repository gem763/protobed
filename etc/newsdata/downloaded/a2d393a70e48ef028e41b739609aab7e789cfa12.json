That\u2019s problematic he said because it seems many of us view rest as \u201cmerely a negative space in life defined by toil ambition and accomplishment\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s going to be particularly poignant for many Australians who live in the big cities, commute hours to work to a job that helps pay for the essentials in life and an extraordinarily large mortgage.\n\nNo work means no mortgage, no house, no way to build family wealth. Building wealth is the Australian dream in the 21st century, not the house as it used to be a generation or two ago.\n\nSo perhaps many Australians don\u2019t \u2013 as Pang suggested \u2013 define ourselves by our work. But we certainly define ourselves by our house, or unit, or inability to get a foot on even the lowest rung of the property ladder.\n\nIndeed, Pang said, \u201cif your work is your self, when you cease to work, you cease to exist\u201d. This is not healthy and not something many Australians would identify with. But if you switch out work for house, you can see the corollary for Australians.\n\nAnd this means we need our rest because otherwise we are going to burn out, either physically, emotionally, or both.\n\nPang said that some of the world\u2019s most creative people worked this out and used the restorative properties of rest to \u201crestore their energy while allowing their muse, the mysterious part of their minds that helps drive the creative process, to keep going\u201d.\n\nI myself \u2013 one holiday in Yamba in the early days of the global financial crisis (GFC) \u2013 had the time to sit on the beach and on the couch to read David Hackett Fischer\u2019s \u201cGreat Wave \u2013 Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History\u201d. Sure, it was a history of inflation, but it was also coincidentally a history of the economy and banking crises for 800 years.\n\nIt set me up perfectly as treasurer of a small bank to manage the balance sheet and navigate my part in the P&L through the GFC in such a way as we made money.\n\nAll simply because I took the time to rest, relax, restore, and read.\n\nLikewise, Pang gives the example of how US Generals including Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton used the relative calm of peace time between the wars to \u201cpause, to dive deep into subjects they couldn\u2019t investigate during busier times, to question how to organise a modern military, and lay the foundations for a more professional army\u201d.\n\nWe all know the results of that in the subsequent victories battles and campaigns of World War II.\n\nSo as the Australian economy gets more difficult to navigate, as our lives get busier, the message is embrace the lazy days of summer, use them to de-stress and recharge, because without them you\u2019ll be less productive, less creative, and ultimately less happy.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
