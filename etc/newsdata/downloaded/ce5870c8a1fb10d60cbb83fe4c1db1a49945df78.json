The lack of televised hearings could limit their ability to capture attention and build voter support for the party\u2019s case against Trump\u2014which Pelosi had long made a prerequisite for pursuing impeachment in the first place. While public hearings haven\u2019t always been a success for the Democrats since they won the House majority last year, they\u2019re a potentially useful venue for compelling political theater.\n\nIn interviews, lawmakers pushed back on the suggestion that Americans have been cut out of the process. \u201cI\u2019m not aware that the public is experiencing any confusion,\u201d Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in an interview yesterday. \u201cI have zero concerns on that front.\u201d\n\nWhat the process has done, however, is open the party up to criticism from Republicans that it\u2019s running an overly secretive operation, including from those who have not marched in lockstep with Trump.\n\n\u201cI want to get to the truth, just like everybody else,\u201d said Representative Jaime Herrera-Beutler, a Republican from a competitive district in Washington State. \u201cBut this needs to happen out in the open, with full transparency, and right now that\u2019s not happening.\u201d Herrera-Beutler was speaking in a video she tweeted on Thursday, in which she stood outside the room where the Intelligence Committee has been hearing testimony in secret.\n\nFor days, Republican members who are not on the panel have been trying to get into the room, knowing full well they would be turned away, to highlight what they claim is a fundamentally unjust process. Yesterday, that was the subject of a heated exchange between the second-ranking members of each party, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, that devolved into a shouting match on the House floor.\n\n\u201cAre we going to finally get beyond this secret, closed-door star-chamber process of impeachment and get to something that is rooted in fairness?\u201d Scalise asked Hoyer.\n\nRead: The risks of impeachment are overblown\n\n\u201cI reject wholly and fully the premise underlying the whip\u2019s representation,\u201d the Democrat replied. \u201cThere is no unfairness in this process.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans are pounding on process, Mr. Speaker, because they do not want to discuss the substance,\u201d Hoyer continued, pounding loudly on his own lectern for effect.\n\nAs for why the Democrats are holding hearings behind closed doors, Hoyer added, \u201cWe do not want to turn it into a circus.\u201d\n\nThat is probably more compelling a reason than many Democrats would care to admit. The party saw firsthand the downside of televised hearings when the House Judiciary Committee called Trump\u2019s pugnacious former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to testify during the brief period when that panel had opened an impeachment probe. Bickering with members and stalling for time, Lewandowski tried to make a mockery of the proceedings. He largely succeeded in stymieing Democrats\u2019 attempt to elicit useful information until the very end of the hearing, when a lawyer for the committee questioned him uninterrupted for a half hour.", "description": "The Democrats\u2019 current strategy could undermine their bid to get public opinion firmly on their side.", "authors": ["Russell Berman", "Elaine Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19284477476652/facebook.jpg?1571438173", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
