The Liberals\u2019 share of the popular vote fell throughout the country as it was losing its hold over the House of Commons.", "description": "The Liberal Party is projected to lose its majority but keep enough seats to form a government.", "authors": ["Ian Austen", "Dan Bilefsky"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/21/world/21canada-new/21canada-new-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
