However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear.\n\nThe technique has been proven to cause weight loss, and therefore, could be a cost-effective intervention one day delivered in a smartphone app.\n\nThe scientists are in the process of launching a large-scale trial in the UK, which will ask participants to track their weight while using go/no-go technique.\n\nOne in three adults in the UK are overweight or obese, and the Government is under pressure to implement strategies to help people drop weight.\n\nResearchers at Cardiff University claim cravings for crisps, chocolate and sweets can be dampened with the 'go/no-go' technique which trains the brain\n\nDespite being aware of what constitutes a healthy diet, people tend to slip up time and time again when they decide to embark on a diet.\n\nCardiff experts call it the 'intention behaviour gap', reflecting the swathes of people who, even though they have desires to lose weight, are unable to stick to a diet and 'self-sabotage'.\n\nDr Lindsay Walker and colleagues say brain training may be the missing puzzle piece to improve people's decision making.\n\nKnown as 'boosting' interventions, they strengthen people's own decision making so that they become consistent with their own goals.\n\nProfessor Christopher Chambers said: 'People sometimes complain about the \u201cnanny state\u201d telling people what to eat or trying to police their eating behaviour.\n\n'And so policies that rely on coercing people to change their behaviour could be counterproductive.\n\n'Boosting interventions working differently \u2014 they\u2019re more like a gym workout than the food police and they should be more acceptable.'\n\nAn example is 'go/no-go training', or GNGT, which has been proven to change people's behaviour in response to unhealthy foods, particularly those high in fat, sugar and salt.\n\nIn training, a picture of a food item is shown on screen alongside a cue. If the food is healthy, the cue is 'go', and the participant must press a button.\n\nIf the food is unhealthy, the cue is 'no-go', and the participant must refrain from pushing the button. They are not punished physically for getting it wrong.\n\nResearchers at Cardiff University claim cravings for crisps, chocolate and sweets can be dampened with the 'go/no-go' technique. They are launching a large trial of an app which uses the technique. Participants will be able to personalise their experience by selecting foods they want to eat more of and less of to include in their training\n\nIn training, a picture of a food item is shown on screen alongside a cue.

Pictured, the app\n\nGNG training has been shown in several studies to reduce people's cravings for unhealthy foods, and even lead to weight loss.\n\nFor example, one study found participants ate less chocolate the morning after training which showed chocolate as a 'no-go' food, compared with participants who did not receive the training.\n\nA similar result has been shown for crisps and sweets up to 24 hours after a training session.\n\nOne study found the training reduced daily calorie intake by 200, and another cut snacking on calorific foods by up to 20 per cent.\n\nWriting in the journal Royal Society Open Science, the team said: 'Many people still struggle to change health-related behaviours despite having the awareness, intention and capability to make the changes.\n\n'GNG training has been found to change food evaluation among people who are classed as morbidly obese.'\n\nProfessor Chambers said: 'We do know that they can make certain foods less appealing. Certain boosting interventions can lead to people to \"devaluing\" those foods.'\n\nThe researchers, who wrote their article in response to a call from the Welsh Government, said GNG is a valuable and cost effective strategy for policy makers to use.\n\nThey also say people with weight to lose are open to psychological interventions because they are fed up with their own 'lapses'.\n\nProfessor Chambers said: 'Smartphones are the most promising way to deliver boosting interventions for encouraging healthy eating because most adults have a smartphone and they can be used during times when we all have a few minutes to spare, such as on the commute to work.'\n\nIn the wake of the policy paper, a large trial called Restrain is being launched to test boosting interventions in around 50,000 people.\n\nThey will be asked to complete five to ten minutes of training every day for three months while weighing themselves weekly.", "description": "'Go/no-go' teaches a person to push a button in response to healthy food.
