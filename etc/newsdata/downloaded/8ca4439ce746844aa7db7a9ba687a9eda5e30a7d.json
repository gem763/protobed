Because of an unspoken pact between politicians and the media over the framing of the process. It has been presented as a tense drama that will lead to a satisfying end-of-season finale\u2014a series of \u201cknife-edge votes\u201d that will eventually deliver a deal, at which point Britain can revert to its pre-2016 reality of ceasing to care much about the existence of the EU. That approach turns everything into a high-stakes drama, which makes sense on a daily basis for hard-pressed editors\u2014Brexit is undeniably complex, its details can be boring, and journalists are also covering an array of other important stories. But when the volume stays turned up to 11, month after month, most viewers feel the urge to change the channel.\n\nRead: This is just the beginning of Brexit\n\nThere are also partisan reasons for the persistence of this \u201ccrunch vote\u201d framing. The biggest and loudest voices among Britain\u2019s still-powerful printed press supported Brexit. For these newspapers\u2014the Daily Mail, The Sunday Times, and The Daily Telegraph among them\u2014as well as their readers and Brexiteers generally, the intractable nature of the negotiations has increased their fears that Brexit could slip away, that Britain could become stuck in an endless transition, or that a second referendum could overturn the 2016 result. Creating momentum toward the exit is an effective counterpoint to these tendencies.\n\nIn the House of Commons yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s new Brexit deal passed the second of the three readings needed to enshrine it in law. Immediately afterward, however, a majority of lawmakers voted against the government\u2019s rushed timetable for all further scrutiny of its details. Johnson has now asked the EU for an extension beyond October 31, when the U.K. was due to leave. As has now become common in British journalism, an anonymous \u201cNumber 10 source\u201d quote was issued to journalists, fulminating against this turn of events. \u201cToday Parliament blew its last chance,\u201d it read. \u201cThis Parliament is totally broken.\u201d\n\nExcept Parliament has not blown its last chance. The legislation is merely paused, despite empty government threats to scrap it entirely. (\u201cBoris Johnson to Pull Brexit Bill If Timetable Not Approved,\u201d read the headline on the BBC\u2019s credulous story.) It is entirely possible that the deal could be approved, when Parliament feels it has had enough time to review the details. The government had offered it only three days to unpick the implications of a 115-page bill.\n\nRead: The improbable triumph of Boris Johnson\n\nThis is democracy functioning as it should: ensuring that big decisions are taken only after due consideration. Yet the implication of several recent newspaper front pages has been not only that Parliament must make the \u201cright\u201d decision\u2014but that it must be made right now, because any delay is antidemocratic. In this climate, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the October 31 deadline was always arbitrary. (The EU is undoubtedly tired of Britain\u2019s long uncoupling, but it still appears to prefer extensions to a No Deal scenario.) Meeting the October deadline was a political choice. So was triggering the Article 50 process, which brought with it a two-year countdown to Britain\u2019s exit, in March 2017.", "description": "Poor coverage of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union risks creating a democratic deficit and storing up resentment for the future.", "authors": ["Helen Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2SHBO/facebook.jpg?1571853288", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
