Nicolas Sanchez, dropped for the crucial loss against England last weekend, scored the first of Argentina's seven tries and pulled the strings from flyhalf as the twice semi-finalists went out of the tournament with a bang. Joaquin Tuculet and Juan Cruz Mallia both scored two tries, while their fellow backs Jeronimo de La Fuente and Gonzalo Martin Bertranou also crossed in a win that assured the Pumas of third place in the pool and a spot at the 2023 World Cup. The winless Eagles were unable to produce the disciplined performance coach Gary Gold wanted from them but will take some solace from two tries for skipper Blaine Scully and another from Paul Lasike.
