Prices of used cars and trucks, which have been volatile in recent months, also posted a large decline, dropping 1.6% on the month.\n\nThe price index for food ticked up 0.1% from August, while shelter costs rose 0.3%.\n\nMeanwhile wages stagnated in September. After adjusting for inflation, average hourly earnings were flat in September from the prior month and are up 1.2% from September 2018.\n\nRecent weak inflation readings come as the Federal Reserve prepares to meet at the end of this month to deliberate the path of interest rates ahead. The central bank lowered its benchmark federal-funds rate for a second time this year in September, to its current range between 1.75% and 2%.\n\n\"Inflation is somewhat below our symmetric 2% objective but has been gradually firming over the past few months,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday in Denver. He didn't explicitly ratify or rebut recent market expectations of another quarter-percentage-point cut at its Oct. 29-30 meeting.\n\nWhile the jobs and inflation picture for the U.S. economy has been favorable, Mr. Powell said global developments pose risks to this outlook, including from trade policy uncertainty and Britain's impending departure from the European Union.\n\nInflation as measured by the Fed's preferred gauge, the personal-consumption-expenditures index, has been muted in recent months.\n\nThe Commerce Department's price index for personal-consumption expenditures rose 1.4% from a year earlier in August-shy of the Fed's 2% year-over-year target. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, inflation was up 1.8% from August 2018.\n\nThe Labor Department's report on consumer prices can be found at: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 10, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
