It was the first clear chance of the game and the Brazilian ought to have found the net.\n\nMason Mount drew the first save from Martin Dubravka. Collecting a pass from Hudson-Odoi with his back to goal, Mount spun neatly and unleashed a crisp effort on the turn. Dubravka flung up his right hand and beat the ball away.\n\nChelsea's Willian reacts after a missed chance during the Premier League match against Newcastle United on Saturday\n\nAllan Saint-Maximin of Newcastle ends up on his knees as he wants a free kick during the match against Chelsea\n\nNewcastle's Saint-Maximin runs with the ball pursues by Mason Mount of Chelsea as the teams look to break the deadlock\n\nNewcastle, with the Longstaff brothers again in the heart of midfield, worked hard to protect their goalkeeper. There were moments when they flickered and threatened on the break, helped at times by some careless distribution by Chelsea as they played out of defence.\n\nAllan Saint-Maximin caused early problems when able to run at Cesar Azpilicueta with his explosions of pace and a blur of step-overs, although without producing anything to go down as a chance or an attempt at goal. The closest the visitors came to troubling Kepa Arrizabalaga was a header wide from Joelinton as he stretched to reach a cross from Saint-Maximin.\n\nLampard selected five English starters \u2013 the most for Chelsea since March 2013 \u2013 but Ross Barkley was forced off with an injury before half-time. Barkley had required treatment for a knock on the ankle in the opening seconds and struggled on until three minutes before the interval when he was replaced by Mateo Kovacic.\n\nSteve Bruce gives his Newcastle players some instructions from the sidelines as they look to get something out of the game\n\nChelsea's Tammy Abraham contests for the ball with Newcastle's Fabian Schar during the first half of the match\n\nChelsea's Ross Barkley shows off his injury to manager Frank Lampard after he was substituted during the first half\n\nFor almost an hour, Tammy Abraham was subdued by Jamal Lascelles. His only glimpse of goal in the first half came when he charged down a clearance by Dubravka who was fortunate to see the rebound swerved away to safety.\n\nThen, Abraham climbed high in a crowd to beat Ciaran Clark to a corner taken by Willian and headed against the bar. He headed another corner over from six yards having again evaded the attention of Clark as Newcastle were forced back.\n\nAn ambitious overhead kick by Fikayo Tomori drifted wide and Fabian Schar cleared low cross by Mount.\n\nChristian Pulisic had only been on for a few seconds when the ball spilled to him in front of goal after another foray into the box by Hudson-Odoi. After a difficult start to his career at Stamford Bridge, this was a rare chance to make an impact. Unfortunately for Pulisic his shot from close range was smothered by Dubravka.\n\nSaint-Maximin goes down in pain as Willian protests to the referee after making a tackle during the Premier League match\n\nThere was a little bit of excitement during the first half when referee Andre Marriner accidentally fell to the ground\n\nMarcos Alonso, Mason Mount, Willian, and Jorginho of Chelsea discuss their tactics for the upcoming free-kick\n\nAnother save denied Willian before the Newcastle \u2018keeper was finally beaten.\n\nHudson-Odoi collected a pass from Pulisic and eased a pass to Alonso, charging forward from left-back to fire a low drive across Dubravka and into the far corner.\n\nAbraham thought he had his goal to make it 2-0 only to be frustrated by a fabulous sliding clearance by DeAndre Yedlin.\n\nClark was close to an equaliser, heading onto roof of net from a cross by Christian Atsu but Chelsea held on for the points.\n\nNewcastle United's Dutch defender Jetro Willems vies with Chelsea's Canadian-born English defender Fikayo Tomori\n\nNewcastle United's goalkeeper Martin Dubravka gestures to his team-mates during the second half of the match", "description": "MATT BARLOW AT STAMFORD BRIDGE: Frank Lampard led the celebrations after a fifth win in a row for Chelsea, coming out with a 1-0 win against Newcastle.", "authors": ["Matt Barlow For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/17/19930180-0-image-a-98_1571501134075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
