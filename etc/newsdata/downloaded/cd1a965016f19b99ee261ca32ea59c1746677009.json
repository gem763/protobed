The display looks like has a slight bezel on each side with the edges of the display curving with the shape of the phone. The top has a metal grille for the earpiece, which sort of confirms that its a phone.\n\nThe narrow form-factor will make it a boon for single-handed use -- which might be what Essential phone is actually targetting at.\n\nLooking at the UI, it looks a lot like Android, but it looks like Essential has put its own skin on top. The screen has a tile-based layout that revealed widgets for Spotify, and app shortcuts for Phone, Maps, Compass, Gallery and Messages.\n\nDon't Miss 1.8 K SHARES 1.4 K SHARES 893 SHARES 843 SHARES 836 SHARES\n\nTwitter/Andy Rubin\n\nThe tip section of the phone shows what appears to be a triangle pointing to the left, which could indicate its a back button, followed by a red bar that looks like a close button or an end-call button.\n\nThe front appears to have a camera, as well as a notification, LED. At the back too the device has a single camera sensor with an LED flash and an indentation below it for what appears to be a fingerprint scanner.\n\nEssential Phone\n\nThe back of the device is made using a colour-shifting material that changes its colours when you look at the phone from different angles, which is definitely cool and takes a step ahead from the gradient coloured backs smartphones have these days.\n\nLeaks in the past have hinted that the device could be rocking Qualcomm's Snapdragon 730 chipset and running on Android 10 out-of-the-box.\n\nEssential Phone was the smartphone that booted the notch-revolution with its first smartphone, and If the Project GEM phone does hit the market, it'll be interesting to see what new features will it have in store for us.", "description": "Andy Rubin, the ex-Google employee and the CEO of Essential Products, the brand that made the Essential Phone has teased a device that looks awfully similar to a TV remote, except it actually is a smartphone, or it sure as hell looks like it.
