REUTERS/Clement Uwiringiyimana\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Port operator DP World (DPW.DI) reported on Tuesday a third quarter decline in cargo handled across its global portfolio as volumes fell in Dubai for a sixth consecutive quarter.\n\nThe operator said it handled 18 million twenty foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers in its ports in the three months to Sept. 30, down 1.6% on the same period a year ago.\n\nIt said a global trade row created a challenging environment. The United States and China have been locked in a trade row that has cast a shadow over global economic prospects.\n\nAt its flagship Jebel Ali port in Dubai, the Middle East\u2019s largest trans-shipment hub, volumes fell 1% to 3.6 million TEUs.\n\nThe operator did not give volumes for Dubai\u2019s smaller Mina Rashid port which have been disclosed in previous statements.\n\nThe company could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nDP World Chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem said volumes at Jebel Ali had been stabilising, adding: \u201cWe remain focused on profitable origin and destination cargo.\u201d\n\nTensions in the Middle East have escalated in the wake of attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and tankers in Gulf waters, a key shipping artery for the global oil trade.\n\nGlobal volumes were flat in the first nine months of the year, while those handled at Jebel Ali were down 5.5%.", "description": "Port operator DP World reported on Tuesday a third quarter decline in cargo handled across its global portfolio as volumes fell in Dubai for a sixth consecutive quarter.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443734417&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L12T", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
