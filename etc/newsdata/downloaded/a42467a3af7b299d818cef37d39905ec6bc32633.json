That was certainly a highlight of Hillary\u2019s appearance on the podcast hosted by David Plouffe, but it wasn\u2019t the only truly paranoid thing she said.\n\nA bit earlier in the same interview, Hillary argued that Trump\u2019s goal was to ensure he never has to leave office. She\u2019s wasn\u2019t talking about a 2nd term after a successful reelection campaign. Hillary believes Trump is seeking to become a permanent American dictator.\n\n\u201cHow concerned are you that what happened in \u201916\u2014the disinformation, the lies, some suppression\u2014now you have an incumbent president, well-funded, who is probably more obsessed with re-election than any president we\u2019ve ever had\u2026Do you think there\u2019s a chance that they could perfect this in this election cycle and what do we do about that?\u201d Plouffe asked.\n\n\u201cI think they are perfecting it as we speak, David,\u201d Hillary replied. She continued, \u201cI\u2019ve told all the candidates I\u2019ve spoken with, I mean there\u2019s so many of them but I think I\u2019ve spoken to a majority of them. I\u2019ve said look, you could run the best campaign, you could have the best plans, you could get the nomination and you could lose.\u201d\n\nHillary then outlines four factors she said could cause this 1) voter suppression, 2) theft of material through hacking, 3) propaganda on social media, and 4) actual interference in the election.\n\nAnd then Hillary suggested Trump is a puppet of Putin: \u201cDonald Trump is Vladimir Putin\u2019s dream,\u201d Hillary said. \u201cHe said that the biggest catastrophe in history was the collapse of the former Soviet Union. As a former KGB guy, he is intent upon undermining democracies and trying to lay the groundwork for a resurgence of Russian greatness as he posits. And Donald Trump is delivering that to him on a daily basis,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why exactly. I don\u2019t know what Putin has on him, whether it\u2019s both personal and financial, I assume it is,\u201d Hillary added.\n\nHillary\u2019s not the first person to make this claim but then she went even further, suggesting Trump\u2019s goal is to remain in office permanently.\n\n\u201cBut more than that, there is this bizarre adulation Trump has for dictators and authoritarians. He dreams of being able to order people to do things and make them do it,\u201d she said. She continued, \u201cHe has no democratic instincts, really. And I saw that when I was Secretary of State and traveled to 112 countries. One of our big problems were people who got themselves elected and then became authoritarian and then did everything they could to rig elections, everything they could to make sure that they were never forced out of power.\n\n\u201cThat is his game plan. That is what he\u2019s trying to achieve. And it\u2019s terrifying to me because scholars, like professor Timothy Snyder who wrote that great little book on tyranny, they\u2019ve told us what the game plan is. But I still think people have a hard time believing that, David. It\u2019s like \u2018Really? Oh, come on\u2026'\u201d\n\nWell, she\u2019s right that people still have a hard time believing this, possibly because it\u2019s completely nuts. I\u2019d even be willing to grant that Trump often seems too impressed with thugs like Kim Jong-Un and Recep Erdogan but the idea that he\u2019s actively working to become a permanent dictator here is a left-wing conspiracy theory worthy of Alex Jones.\n\nWhat this brought to mind for me was Hillary\u2019s infamous comment about a \u201cvast-right-wing conspiracy\u201d to take down her husband. At the time that seemed oddly conspiratorial but listening to this podcast, you get the impression this is Hillary\u2019s default setting. She is a deeply paranoid person. That might also explain some of her other behavior, come to think of it. What kind of person sets up a private server in their basement? Someone who is this paranoid.\n\nWe\u2019ve really come a long way from the days when the left was up in arms over Trump saying the 2016 election was rigged. Now Hillary is the one claiming 2020 will be rigged against whoever is the Democratic candidate. I wonder how the media will react to all of this now.\n\nThe full interview isn\u2019t available on YouTube so you\u2019ll have to click here to listen. Plouffe\u2019s question about Trump\u2019s re-election starts about 12 minutes in. Hillary\u2019s comment about Putin having kompromat on Trump comes at 16:20. Finally, her claim that Trump is seeking to become a dictator appears at 17:00.", "description": "\"I still think people have a hard time believing that...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/HillaryClinton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
