The pregnancy would not take place in space, only a a 24- to 36-hour mission for the labour\n\n'This is only possible, for now, in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO), and it is only possible thanks to a very thorough selection procedure,' he said.\n\nLower earth orbit is an earth-centred orbit with an altitude of 2,000 km or less.\n\nThe congress heard some of the requirements for participant expectant mothers, and medical staff.\n\nThese would include having experience of two flawless previous deliveries, and a high natural radiation resistance.\n\nDr Edelbroek said: 'You can induce the labour process like they do in IVF clinics on a daily basis.\n\n'Planning is, of course, an issue \u2013 it is hard to plan a natural process like this if there is something wrong with the weather, or a delay with the launch.\n\n'We could never work with just one pregnant woman.\n\n'We would have maybe 30 participants and they could step out at any moment.\n\n'But the experts that we work with, they believe, and I believe, that this is possible at a lower risk level than an average Western-style delivery on Earth.\n\nThe first baby could be born in space within the next 12 years, an expert has said\n\n'That would be the only way to make this possible.'\n\nHe added that, while he thought this was possible, he was not planning for it, with the company's work focusing on embryo development and conception in space.\n\nSpaceBorn Utd researches conditions for human reproduction in space, and is focused on Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).\n\nAsked about the 12-year estimate, Dr Edelbroek said it would depend on funding and developments in the space tourism sector.\n\n'If that sector is going to accelerate in the way it's doing right now, there will be markets for very wealthy people who aren't prepared to do three months' military training, happy to go as they are,' he said.\n\n'And there will be spacecraft that are very comfortable for those people.\n\n'It depends on the risk you are willing to take.'\n\nDr Edelbroek was formerly part of another company SpaceLife Origin, who also hoped to launch a pregnant women into space to give birth.\n\nBut according to a message on its website the operational activities of the company have been suspended as CEO & Founder Kees Mulder said he had ended the relationship with Dr Edelbroek 'due to a serious and irreparable breach of trust.'\n\nDuring a study conducted by NASA in 1997 pregnant rats were observed during readaptation to 1-g force and labor and delivery in space.\n\nAlthough the rats gave birth successfully after exposure to microgravity an analysis of the rat's labour found that they experienced around twice the number of labour contractions as controls on earth.\n\nDr Irina Ogneva, who works at the Russian Academy of Sciences, says that Moscow is aiming to have the first baby born in space\n\nIn June Dr Irina Ogneva, lab head of cell biophysics of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of Russian Academy of Sciences, revealed the ambition for the first baby born in space to be Russian.\n\n'We have always been first in space, and would want the first human to be born in space to be a citizen of Russia,' she said.\n\nBut she admitted that so far Russian cosmonauts have refused to donate sperm obtained in space for scientific study.\n\nDr Ogneva did not make clear whether she expects the first space baby to be conceived as well as born in orbit.\n\nOn a baby being born in orbit, she said: 'We should take care about the person and not patriotic populism as the cornerstone.\n\n'Most important is not the fact [for the baby] to be born, but [for the child] to be born healthy.\n\n'And in this sense we are, beyond any doubt, competitive, because we hold the leadership in many studies.'\n\nThe leading scientist said: 'It is too early to set a goal but it can be set as an aim.'\n\nAnd she admitted: 'From a scientific point of view, the birth of any mammal in space is an aim that can be achieved.", "description": "Dr Egbert Edelbroek, founder and chief executive of SpaceBorn United, said the company is designing missions where pregnant women can give birth in orbit on a 24- to 36-hour mission.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/11/19735572-0-image-a-3_1571135776625.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
