So he picked up the phone and called network chief Phil Griffin.\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nMultiple sources tell The Daily Beast that the conversation earlier this year became acrimonious, with Halperin dishing up vague threats against his former boss.\n\nMSNBC declined to comment on the episode. But MSNBC insiders said Griffin was furious about the conversation and wouldn\u2019t likely take Halperin\u2019s calls in the future.\n\nThe hostile exchange was a sign of Halperin\u2019s frustration that his dream of returning to the punditry business\u2014almost two years after numerous women came forward with stories of sexual misconduct\u2014has been thwarted at each turn.\n\nThe former MSNBC contributor has been attempting to rehab a career that imploded when former colleagues and subordinates accused him of groping and unwanted sexual advances during his tenure as an ABC News political reporter.\n\nAfter months of silence, Halperin began dipping back into the public eye. Earlier this year, he launched a politics blog called \u201cMark Halperin\u2019s Wide World of News,\u201d appeared on national radio interviews, and authored a new political book set for release this fall.\n\nThe Game Change author has privately told friends that he wants to return to cable news, and he has lobbied various media outlets for a second chance. The Daily Beast reported earlier this year that, according to sources, Halperin called the top editor at D.C.-based political newspaper The Hill to inquire about job prospects but was rebuffed.\n\nAnd then when Halperin\u2019s pals Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski sought to collaborate with him on an online-only MSNBC broadcast analyzing the 2018 midterm elections, network brass shut down the entire plan. The failed scheme caused consternation within the building\u2014\u201cEverybody was going \u2018WTF!,\u2019\u201d one MSNBC insider told The Daily Beast\u2014and ultimately led to Halperin\u2019s hostile call with Griffin.\n\nNot only has Halperin\u2019s career revival been curbed by his own ex-employer, it\u2019s been poorly received by the public at large.\n\nA number of Democratic analysts who spoke to Halperin on the record for his upcoming book expressed regret for participating in the project following outrage from critics and the women who accused him of misconduct.\n\nAnd his friends at Morning Joe faced serious backlash for boosting his rehab tour on-air earlier this year by dedicating a segment to his apologetic interview with SiriusXM radio host Michael Smerconish and positively commenting on his words. Sources told The Daily Beast at the time that network executives were unaware the show planned to address the sensitive Halperin topic and were unhappy with the decision.\n\nWhen Smerconish, who also hosts a CNN weekend program, once again invited Halperin on his SiriusXM daytime talk show last week, a top CNN spokesperson expressed disbelief on Twitter. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d wrote Matt Dornic, the network\u2019s vice president of communications.\n\nHalperin has repeatedly expressed remorse for his actions, telling The Daily Beast last year that he was \u201cdeeply sorry and hope to have a chance to apologize directly to those I treated badly. It is the right and necessary thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut he has also taken not-so-subtle swipes at his critics, seeming to question their sincerity.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a perfect person when I made these mistakes,\u201d he told Smerconish during his interview on Sirius XM earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019m not a perfect person now. I\u2019m happy to be judged by perfect people.\u201d", "description": "Sources said the disgraced political reporter became hostile in a phone chat with his ex-boss after reports emerged that MSNBC brass axed plans for Halperin to return to punditry.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567991608/190908-Tani-Mark-Halperin-MSNBC-tease_k9bqgg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
