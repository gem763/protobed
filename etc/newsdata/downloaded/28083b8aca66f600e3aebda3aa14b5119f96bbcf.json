(Courtesy of Steve Molitz)\n\nColumnist\n\nIt is a well-known fact that a harmonica player never goes anywhere without at least one harmonica secreted upon his or her person. While something like a tourniquet, a Tide pen or a needle and thread might be more useful, harmonica players live in constant hope that a blues jam will spontaneously erupt and they will be called upon to administer an emergency harp solo.\n\nAnd so it was on Sept. 15 at the Rams Head On Stage in Annapolis. Jonathan Adelstein was there \u2014 and he was ready.\n\nAdelstein \u2014 chief executive of the Arlington, Va.-based Wireless Infrastructure Association \u2014 actually had a little advance notice when he was pulled from the audience at the concert by Doors guitarist Robby Krieger. Adelstein had gotten the word from Steve Molitz, the keyboard player in Krieger\u2019s touring band.\n\n\u201cI met him at [Grateful Dead drummer] Mickey Hart\u2019s ranch in California,\u201d Adelstein said of Molitz.\n\nAdelstein used to serve on the Federal Communications Commission and before that he was a U.S. Senate staffer. His work on telecommunications issues put him in contact with various music industry types, allowing him to indulge his passion for harmonica and share the stage with such musicians as Steve Cropper, Patti Smith and Mike Mills of R.E.M.\n\nBefore the Rams Head show, Adelstein had dinner with Molitz, who said, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t know if Robby will go along with it, but will you sit in?\u201d\n\nRobby did go along with it, and he invited Adelstein, 57, to the stage after asking the audience a Doors trivia question: Who played the harmonica on the band\u2019s \u201cRoadhouse Blues\u201d?\n\nIt was the Lovin\u2019 Spoonful\u2019s John Sebastian. And that\u2019s the song Adelstein played with the band.\n\n\u201cFor harmonica players, it\u2019s sort of a classic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know it and love it. I was ready to go.\u201d\n\nThe two traded licks back and forth \u2014 Krieger on his Gibson SG, Adelstein on his Hohner Marine Band \u2014 four or five times.\n\nDid Adelstein do okay?\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve played with a lot of good musicians. He\u2019s probably the best guitar player I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d\n\nAdelstein\u2019s brief star turn wasn\u2019t the only fun thing to happen at the Sept. 15 Rams Head show. MASN broadcaster Phil Wood got to meet Krieger for the second time in his life, after a gap of 52 years.\n\nOn Aug. 18, 1967, a cover band that Wood played guitar in, the Brotherhood, was among the acts that opened for the Doors at a notorious show at the Alexandria Arena roller rink. Like the other opening bands, the Brotherhood was represented by Domestic Sounds, a booking agency run out of Giant Music in Falls Church, Va.\n\nThere were nearly a dozen opening acts that evening, a number meant to fill time as the Doors were coming straight from a show that afternoon in Annapolis.\n\n\u201cThe only rule was, we couldn\u2019t play any Doors song,\u201d Wood said.\n\nAs the bands milled around waiting to go on, 75 percent of the Doors arrived: Krieger, John Densmore and Ray Manzarek. They kept pretty much to themselves as an Elektra Records representative went around handing out free copies of the Doors\u2019 debut album to those in the \u201cdressing room\u201d: the room where the rental skates were stored.\n\nAnd then Jim Morrison stumbled through the door.\n\n\u201cIt was my first experience with the expression \u2018stinking drunk,\u2019\u201d Wood said. \u201cYou could smell him coming in.\u201d\n\nMorrison had downed a bottle or two of liquor as he was driven south in a separate car from his bandmates.\n\n\u201cHe never approached the other three guys in the band,\u201d said Wood, 68. \u201cHe stayed on the opposite side of the room and sat on a stool with his head down.\u201d\n\nSomeone walked over to the George Washington High graduate, Class of 1961, and asked: \u201cHey Jim, don\u2019t your parents live close to here?\u201d\n\nMorrison\u2019s response: \u201cMy parents are dead.\u201d\n\nSaid Wood: \u201cIt turns out his parents weren\u2019t dead. In fact, they lived in Alexandria at the time.\u201d\n\nThe shambling show is recounted in Mark Opsasnick\u2019s \u201cThe Lizard King Was Here: The Life and Times of Jim Morrison in Alexandria, Virginia.\u201d Before leaving the stage, the surly Morrison flipped the bird and hurled something \u2014 probably a cymbal \u2014 into the crowd. It struck a girl in the forehead, drawing blood. Her name is lost to the mists of time.\n\nRich Landon, a friend of Krieger\u2019s who lives in District Heights, Md., arranged for Wood to meet the guitarist before the show. Wood gave Krieger a copy of the flier from the 1967 Alexandria roller rink show.\n\nI asked Wood if he\u2019d brought his free Doors album to have autographed.\n\nNo, he said. \u201cSomebody stole it in college.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Love me two times: MASN\u2019s Phil Wood also got to meet the Doors guitarist \u2014 again.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6zZGvrPR4IqryOysYgnpfhj5QwI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RCVJTZG7WUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
