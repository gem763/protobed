So he had a tattoo of koi swimming upstream, which signifies a strong will and the power to overcome something. It's that kind of symbolism.\"\n\nAnton says yakuza members used to meet in communal bath houses mainly because the lack of clothing meant rival gangs meeting each other could figure out who they were dealing with by the artwork on their body.\n\n\"The other reason meeting up in bath houses is important is because you see that nobody has a concealed weapon, because you're all naked.\"\n\nNot just any old yakuza can get a tattoo\n\n\"It's actually the tattoo master who's deciding whether that person is good enough to have a tattoo,\" Anton says.\n\nIf the master decides you're worthy, it's a process that can take up to a year to complete in weekly sessions at a cost of around \u00a310,000.\n\nThat's actually one of the ways yakuza would attract younger members, according to Anton.\n\nImage copyright anton kusters\n\n\"The young kids, who are 17, 16, and very impressionable - the lost youth in Japan hanging around on the streets - would obviously be very allured by the yakuza lifestyle, because they look like smooth criminals in a way.\n\n\"Having a tattoo would obviously be high on their wish list. And that would be when the yakuza would say 'OK we will pay for this for you, and you can work it off'.\n\n\"And that's the way you get sucked in as a member.\"\n\nImage copyright anton kusters\n\nThe tattoos take so long to complete and cost so much because Japanese tattoos are still done without electrical equipment, with apprenticeships able to last several decades.\n\n\"They use a fine wooden stick with four needles at the top and push them manually, by hand, at about two stabs per second. And they vary the angle depending on the amount of fat in the area of the body.\n\n\"They sign their tattoos, but they still sign with the name of their master, so there is this old tradition that keeps on going that way.\"\n\n'It's about respect'\n\nAnton says the yakuza keep their tattoos covered up in public because they're very aware that tattoos are frowned upon.\n\n\"They're the ones who brought upon this frowning, obviously, because they started tattooing themselves.\"\n\nImage copyright anton kusters\n\nBut he adds that westerners walking around in public with full sleeves won't cause an issue as long as they obey rules in the communal bath houses popular around the country.\n\n\"Historically they didn't dare say 'We don't want yakuza having meetings here and chasing away the other customers'. So they would say in a very opaque way 'We don't allow tattoos', because hundreds of years ago only yakuza people had tattoos.\"\n\nAdvice for tourists is to wear a T-shirt in pools, as the New Zealand and Samoan rugby teams have been doing and the Welsh rugby team says it will do.\n\n\"Covering your tattoo and showing to other people in the pool that you understand it could be something offensive - and that you have taken action to cover it - it's showing that you're aware of your surroundings and respecting them,\" says Anton.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Body art is seen as being offensive to some people in Japan because of the link to organised crime.", "authors": ["Kameron Virk", "Newsbeat Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ADD2/production/_108889444_antonkusters_yakuza_092_p1000093.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
