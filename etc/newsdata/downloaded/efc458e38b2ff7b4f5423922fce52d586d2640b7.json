From the story:\n\nKevorkian\u2019s ghoulish reputation is belied by the videotaped consultations in the archive. They show Kevorkian turning down many people seeking assistance and only signed on after he spoke to them and their family members and was assured of their terminal state\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne problem with that: Whatever his interviews may show, it isn\u2019t true that he limited his assisted suicides to the dying.\n\nAccording to autopsies, about 70% of Kevorkian\u2019s customers\u2013remember he was a pathologist, not a treating physician who only saw people wanting to kill themselves, so they can hardly be called patients\u2013were NOT terminally ill. Most were disabled and depressed.\n\nIndeed, Kevorkian assisting the suicides of the depressed disabled to general societal applause was what brought the disability rights community actively into the struggle against legalizing assisted suicide.\n\nFive of Kevorkian\u2019s death customers weren\u2019t even ill, according to their autopsies. And this was true from the beginning. Kevorkian\u2019s second death, Marjorie Wantz, complained of pelvic pain but had no determinable illness.\n\nMoreover, Kevorkian was NOT IN IT FOR THE \u201cCOMPASSION.\u201d He was ghoul who wanted to conduct human vivisection as he described in his 1992 book, Prescription Medicide (my emphasis:)\n\nI feel it is only decent and fair to explain my ultimate aim. \u2026 It is not simply to help suffering or doomed persons kill themselves \u2014 that is merely the first step, an early distasteful professional obligation (now called medicide) that nobody in his or her right mind would savor. \u2026 What I find most satisfying is the prospect of making possible the performance of invaluable experiments or other beneficial medical acts under conditions that this first unpleasant step can help establish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis goal was pure quackery. Again from Prescription Medicide:\n\nIf we are ever to penetrate the mystery of death\u2014even superficially\u2014it will have to be through obitiatry. Research using cultured cells and tissues and live animals may yield objective biological data, and eventually perhaps even some clues about the essence of mere vitality or existence. But knowledge about the essence of human death will of necessity require insight into the nature of the unique awareness of or consciousness that characterizes cognitive human life. That is possible only through obitiatric research on living human bodies, and most likely centering on the nervous system\u2026on anesthetized subjects [to] pinpoint the exact onset of extinction of an unknown cognitive mechanism that energizes life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevorkian never quite got there, but he came close. He ripped out the kidneys of Joseph Tushkowski\u2013a quadriplegic ex cop\u2013and held a press conference offering them to the public, \u201cFirst come, first served.\u201d\n\nIn this regard, it is worth noting that Kevorkian tried to gain access to condemned prisoners upon which to experiment for several years. It was only when he was kicked out of every prison that he turned his attention to the sick, and more emphatically, the disabled.\n\nJack Kevorkian was a ghoul, a quack, and a narcissist. That was his problem.\n\nNow, he\u2019s dead and gone. The fact that so many refuse to see the real Kevorkian\u2013and that the media work so hard to forget the history of his real goals and agendas\u2013I am afraid, is our problem.", "description": "The revisionism about Jack Kevorkian, who assisted the suicides of about 130 people the video of which he immediately took to 60 Minutes, continues.", "authors": ["Wesley J.
