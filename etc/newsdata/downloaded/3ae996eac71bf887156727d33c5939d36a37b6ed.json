Last week it added contracts with Taronga Zoo, BridgeClimb Sydney and Catholic Healthcare to its customer list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack story\n\nThe idea for the business came to Mr Melkote in 2002, when Wi-Fi was emerging. At the time, he said, it was predominantly seen as a technology for homes.\n\n\"I just wanted to go try my hand at something on my own and I got fascinated by this idea of Wi-Fi,\" he said.\n\n\"My idea was to take Wi-Fi to the enterprise. And try to apply it for large organisations, universities, banks, hospitals and retail.\"\n\nMr Melkote had spent the early part of his career in the networking industry at companies such as Cisco and Intel, as well as some small start-ups, so he understood how businesses worked from both perspectives.\n\n\"The good part about Silicon Valley is there's an ecosystem of support for entrepreneurs,\" he said.\n\n\"You need to have a good idea and the support will chorale around you to help you get going.\"\n\nThe biggest question venture capitalists raised when Mr Melkote came to them with his idea was why wouldn't an incumbent networking company crush him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Melkote's answer was that networks at the time were built around wired connections, so the idea of wireless networking was disruptive to the business model of a player like Cisco.\n\nHe believed revenue generated through selling and laying mountains of cabling infrastructure would no longer be generated with wireless networking.\n\nBy 2007, Aruba had listed on the Nasdaq and in 2015 was bought by HP in a $US3 billion deal.\n\nAlso in 2015, HP split in two with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) becoming its own entity. Aruba joined HPE, which Mr Melkote negotiated with then HPE boss Meg Whitman as part of the acquisition.\n\n\"They've had a chequered history in the past of acquisitions. So they wanted to really make this work and Meg understood innately that she needed to retain the culture to make it a part of HP and make it grow,\" he said.\n\nThe next disruption\n\nAt HPE, Mr Melkote started working on what he sees as the next big disruptive technology, Edge computing.\n\nThis involves processing data at the edge of a network where the data is being generated, rather than in a centralised location.\n\n\"Having the benefit of HP behind us, nudging us, giving us more R &D dollars to be able to spend on the innovation in this particular direction has been very helpful,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think that commitment of having that scaled, large organisation behind us to be able to take us globally, has really accelerated our plans and helped us in a big way and they've left us alone, which is fantastic.\"", "description": "Aruba founder and president Keerti Melkote says edge computing is the next frontier for WiFi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3613%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_210%2C$y_21/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/73859766d65ca2d4159d8c939d9e4d2d978d7f17", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
