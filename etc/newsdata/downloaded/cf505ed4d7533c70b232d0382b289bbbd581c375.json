He was instead denied Holy Communion by Father Robert E. Morey because of his abortion views, the South Carolina Morning News reported.\n\n\"Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\" Morey told the Morning News in an email. \"Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\"\n\n\"I will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\" Morey told the Morning News.\n\nBiden supports abortion rights and the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which legalizes the procedure. But, he also faced criticism for his past views on abortion, which has emerged as a flashpoint issue in the 2020 race.\n\nAs recently as June, Biden advocated for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal taxpayer dollars for abortion, except in extremely limited circumstances. He changed his stance amid immense criticism over his views and following a slew of state efforts by Republicans to roll back access to the procedure.\n\n\"If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's ZIP code,\" Biden said at a Democratic National Committee gala hosted in Atlantic in June.\n\nInsider has reached out to the Biden Campaign for comment.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was reportedly denied Holy Communion at a church in Florence, South Carolina, because he supports abortion.", "authors": ["Nicole Einbinder"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db84b73e94e8636d838d584?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
