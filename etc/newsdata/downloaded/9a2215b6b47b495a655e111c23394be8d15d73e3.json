REUTERS/Jeenah Moon/File Photo\n\nDimon, who made the comments at an event in Washington hosted by the Institute of International Finance, did not elaborate on why he believed Libra was a non-starter.\n\nBut the Wall Street Journal reported this week that JPMorgan had declined to join the project due to concerns the digital currency could be used for criminal activities that would violate money-laundering and sanctions rules.\n\nThe ambitious efforts of Facebook Inc to establish a global digital currency have suffered severe setbacks in recent weeks, after several high profile partners including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and eBay abandoned the project.\n\nThe exodus followed a pushback from policymakers and regulators in the United States and Europe over concerns Libra could upend the global financial system, threaten users\u2019 privacy and facilitate money laundering.\n\nDavid Marcus, a Facebook executive who has been leading the project, said this week he expected to get 100 banks and financial firms on board once the project has addressed regulatory concerns..\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday night, Marcus said Libra did not need banks or payment firms to launch the system, however. He added that Libra intended to meet the highest possible regulatory standards, if not exceed them.\n\nDimon has in the past been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies and described bitcoin as a \u201cfraud\u201d in 2017. Back then Dimon said cryptocurrencies were \u201cworse than tulips bulbs,\u201d referring to a famous market bubble in the 1600s.\n\nHe tempered his view a few months later, saying he regretted calling bitcoin a fraud, but maintained his disinterest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nStill, JPMorgan made its own foray into the digital asset space in February, launching a \u201cJPM Coin\u201d to allow its clients to instantly transfer payments over a blockchain network.\n\nIn a presentation on its website at the time, JPMorgan said it was supportive of \u201ccryptocurrencies as long as they are properly controlled and regulated.\u201d", "description": "Facebook's Libra digital currency project is \"a neat idea that will never happen,\" JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Friday, adding to scepticism about the project that has faced criticism from policymakers and some regulators.", "authors": ["Michelle Price", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442476612&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1UZ", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
