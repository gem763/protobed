That said, a new clip has been making the rounds online as it featured what players can expect in the game. Also, PUBG Corporation confirmed a couple of things that will be included in the upcoming season.\n\nPUBG\u2019s Season 5 trailer\n\nReddit user u/alejandroobjio recently took to r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS to show what he stumbled upon.\n\nIf his post is anything to go by, it contains a link to a YouTube video and it is believed to be \u201cPUBG\u2019s\u201d intro for Season 5 dubbed \u201cBadlands.\u201d\n\nThe minute-long clip has the title \u201cseason autoplay film\u201d where it showed several notable items that are likely to be rolled out when Season 5 goes live. One of them is the Spike strip that was showcased early in the video. Another interesting thing that was spotted in the clip was the throwable ax/tomahawk (melee weapon throwing combat feature), though players are hoping for something that would rival the crossbow.\n\nA race track in Miramar was also featured and this has been confirmed by \u201cPUBG\u2019s\u201d Executive Producer TS Jang in a recent tweet. The said post also contained a link to the patch notes for the game\u2019s 5.1 update (now live on the Test Server) for PC.\n\nPer the patch notes, the race track known as the A LA Muerte Vamos track has been added into the game where players can speed through ramps, loops, jumps and even signboards.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

This is to compensate the long-range engagements within the map:\n\nScopes get an 18 percent increase\n\nAR gets a 12 percent increase\n\nDMR gets a 29 percent increase\n\nWinchester 94 (Win94) gets a 30 percent increase\n\n(Win94) gets a 30 percent increase There\u2019s also a slight increase in the spawn rates of bags, helmets, and vests\n\nThe only thing that got a decrease was the spawn rate of pistols that was trimmed down by 31 percent.\n\nThe Win94, on the other hand, has been confirmed to be getting a scope just like the VSS. It was pointed out, however, that players cannot remove it nor add a different scope to the rifle. Prior to the release of the game's 5.1 patch notes, Community Manager Hawkinz (@Hawkinz) already confirmed via Twitter that they\u2019ll be increasing the loot in Miramar.\n\nThe patch notes also provided details about the return of \"PUBG's\" Survivor Pass that has new missions, improved systems, and new rewards.\n\nIt also includes new community missions where players can join together to unlock Miramar's secret.", "description": "Patch notes for PUBG\u2019s new update is now live in the game\u2019s test server.", "authors": ["Asmir Pekmic", "Read More On The Same Topic E.
