Did the mainstream media run with this story? Of course not. That would ruin the narrative.\n\nMann became famous for the chart, which showed temperatures running along in a horizontal fashion before spiking at the beginning of the 20th century. It was the \u201cevidence\u201d the global warming alarmists had been waiting for \u2014 \u201cscience\u201d that showed human activity was overheating Earth. It was included in at least one United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.\n\nNot all were convinced, however. There were questions about the data he used to create the stick, which he wouldn\u2019t release. It has been called \u201c100% fraudulent,\u201d an \u201cartifact of poor mathematics,\u201d and a violation of \u201cof scientific standards.\u201d\n\nMann has been accused of engaging in \u201cdata manipulation,\u201d and \u201cacademic and scientific misconduct.\u201d\n\nSome years after the stick was constructed, Canadian statisticians Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick challenged Mann\u2019s work. They argued the \u201crecent paleoclimate reconstruction by Mann et al. does not provide reliable evidence about climate change over the past millennium, because their data are inconsistent and their confidence intervals are wrong.\u201d\n\nClimate researcher Tim Ball even went so deep as to say that Mann \u201cbelongs in the state pen, not Penn State,\u201d where Mann conducts research. Ball found out that was the wrong thing to say. Mann sued him in Canada.\n\nBall, however, beat Mann in court. The case was dismissed Friday. Almost immediately, Ball wrote to Anthony Watts of the wattsupwiththat website, telling him \u201cMann\u2019s case against me was dismissed this morning by the (British Columbia) Supreme Court and they awarded me (court) costs.\u201d According to John Hinderaker, an attorney and PowerLine blog contributor, the case was thrown out \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that Dr. Ball asserted a truth defense. He argued that the hockey stick was a deliberate fraud, something that could be proved if one had access to the data and calculations, in particular the R2 regression analysis, underlying it,\u201d Hinderaker wrote. \u201cMann refused to produce these documents. He was ordered to produce them by the court and given a deadline. He still refused to produce them, so the court dismissed his case.\u201d\n\nJohn O\u2019Sullivan at Principia Scientific International believes the \u201cextraordinary outcome will likely trigger severe legal repercussions for Dr. Mann in the U.S. and may prove fatal to alarmist climate science claims that modern temperatures are \u2018unprecedented.'\u201d\n\nBig news, right? Not in the U.S. The media that acts as the climate hysterics\u2019 public relations arm has ignored the case.\n\nSo it\u2019s just a Canadian story, then? Not hardly. The U.S. media played the hockey stick as an American/Western/global story. What happens to its author in a courtroom should be U.S. news.\n\nIt\u2019s plausible that the media have deserted Mann. Several mainstream outlets sided with the Competitive Enterprise Institute and National Review, which the litigious Mann had sued for defamation. They were concerned that allowing the lawsuit to go forward would be a threat to First Amendment freedoms.\n\nBut the lack of coverage would be the same if any climate alarmist had suffered a legal loss. If we might paraphrase the brilliant \u201cJim Treacher,\u201d journalism today is all about which facts the public shouldn\u2019t know because they might reflect poorly on the global warming narrative. The silence is wholly predictable.\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
