Now we just follow the sound of gunfire,\u201d Mohammad told AFP.\n\n\u201cIf they cut off regular phone lines, we\u2019ll be completely blind,\u201d he noted.\n\nFor 25-year-old women\u2019s rights activist Rasha, taking to the streets carries too much risk, but she says she has found a different way to get involved.\n\nEvery day, her male friends text her dozens of updates from protest squares across the country, which she then texts and phones through to friends in the United Arab Emirates and Europe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an intermediary. I can\u2019t protest myself so this is the least I can do,\u201d she said, telling AFP the phone credit she buys has cost her around $100 (90 euros) per day for the last three days.\n\nRasha, who comes from Baghdad, is also saving videos and other unpublished material from one of the first protests that turned violent. She attended that initial demonstration.\n\n\u201cThey think we\u2019ll forget they fired at us, they think people won\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve got the videos and I\u2019ll publish everything I saw that day the minute the internet comes back,\u201d she said.\n\nJaafar Raad, an unemployed 29-year-old Iraqi who has frequently protested, is also storing dozens of images and videos to release once the blackout is lifted.\n\nHe even records voice notes from the protests themselves in applications like Whatsapp and Facebook, so that the audio messages will automatically send to friends abroad and international media outlets as soon as the internet returns.\n\n\u201cPeople must know what happened to us. This is so we can hold those behind the violence accountable,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "With secret satellites, pricey messages abroad and\u00a0clandestine file transfers, young Iraqis are circumventing an internet blackout aimed at stifling several days of bloody protests in the capital and beyond", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iraq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
