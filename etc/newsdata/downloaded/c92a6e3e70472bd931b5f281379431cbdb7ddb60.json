(Photo: Jared C. Tilton, Getty Images)\n\nThings got physical between two NASCAR Xfinity Series championship contenders on pit road following Saturday's race at Kansas Speedway, won by Brandon Jones, who raced to his first career Xfinity victory.\n\nPlayoff drivers Cole Custer and Tyler Reddick made contact on the track during the Kansas Lottery 300, and afterward, they briefly exchanged heated words.\n\nBut the situation then escalated quickly when Custer put his right hand on Reddick's left shoulder, and Reddick then put both his hands on Custer in response. The two tangled with each other while nearby team members failed to quickly break them apart.\n\nBoth drivers ended up on the ground before eventually being separated.\n\nHere's another angle:\n\nThe scuffle was the result of contact between the two after a restart with five laps remaining in the race - the first in the playoffs' Round of 8 as drivers race for a spot in the championship race at Homestead-Miami Speedway in November.\n\nReddick in the No. 2 Chevrolet made contact with Custer's No. 00 Ford, which forced Custer into the wall. Reddick finished second behind winner Brandon Jones, while Custer was 11th.\n\nWhen both drivers went to explain themselves to reporters after the incident, they each had their own version of what happened.\n\nCuster told NBC Sports he was hoping to have a rational conversation and acknowledged he put his hand on Reddick first but said it wasn't in an aggressive way:\n\n\"I was just frustrated that he can't keep his car on the bottom and then runs us up into the wall. If he wants to wreck cars and put them in the wall, from time to time, that's fine. But when it affects me, I'm not going to be very happy with him. I don't know. I just want over to talk to him and say that, and I put my hand on him, and he just went berserk. I thought we had a good car. I thought a shot to win.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we'll talk about it here soon.\" @TylerReddick tells his side of the story to @NASCARonNBC. pic.twitter.com/EEj0I914MA \u2014 NASCAR Xfinity (@NASCAR_Xfinity) October 19, 2019\n\nUnderstandably, Reddick said he wasn't going to tolerate having Custer's hand on him, but he also said he appreciates his point of view. He told NBC Sports:\n\n\"I understand Cole's frustration 100 percent. We're trying to lock ourselves into Homestead, and he came up to talk after the race. And as soon as he put a hand on me, I put a hand on him back. That's just how it's going to be if we're going to have a conversation that way. Out of breath, but had a fight there with some people, and it was a little bit of fun. \u2026\n\n\"I think a lot of Cole and his driving ability, a lot of that team. So just heat of the moment. We're pissed off. I'm sure we'll talk about it here soon, maybe today, tomorrow. Who knows? Maybe have a beer over it.\"\n\nCuster also said he's never had issues with Reddick before, via FOX Sports' and USA TODAY Sports contributor Bob Pockrass:\n\nCole Custer after the race on what happened with Reddick and the rumble afterward: pic.twitter.com/W8H5DceXVH \u2014 Bob Pockrass (@bobpockrass) October 19, 2019\n\nReddick said he doesn't consider himself a fighter as he described more of his perspective on the altercation, which he said included being put in a headlock:", "description": "After the two drivers made contact on the track, things escalated on pit road following Saturday's race, and both drivers ended up on the ground.", "authors": ["Michelle R.
