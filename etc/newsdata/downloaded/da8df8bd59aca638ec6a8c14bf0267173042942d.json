Listen to what he has to say about betting on Week 5. USA TODAY\n\nThe NFL appears to be strengthening its case against Vontaze Burfict.\n\nThe league has already suspended the Oakland Raiders linebacker for the rest of the season following a vicious helmet-to-helmet hit on Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle that led to his ejection last week. On Friday, the league informed Burfict of another hit on a defenseless receiver during Sunday's game, agent Lamont Smith told ESPN.\n\nThe play itself did not draw a flag and occurred early in the second quarter. Burfict drilled Colts running back Nyheim Hines in the head while quarterback Jacoby Brissett scrambled to the opposite side of the field.\n\nBurfict's appeal will be conducted via teleconference at 2 p.m. Tuesday. Smith informed ESPN that the league will use the additional hit among the complete list of Burfict's offenses in its arguments.\n\nHere\u2019s the other helmet-to-helmet hit that Vontaze Burfict delivered during Sunday\u2019s game: second quarter, 13:24 left, and Burfict launches and blasts Colts\u2019 RB Nyheim Hines away from the play.
