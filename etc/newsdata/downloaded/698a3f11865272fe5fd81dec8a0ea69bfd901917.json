The skeletons still had some clothing on them, and items of clothing suggest two may be women.\n\nFour full days of digging at the spot, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, revealed only two of the bodies were recent and still had decomposing flesh on them.\n\nDrug and kidnapping gangs use such pits to dispose of the bodies of victims or rivals.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A total of 42 bodies and skeletons have been pulled from a clandestine burial pit in the Mexican desert near the Gulf of California beach town of Puerto Penasco, which is known to tourists as Rocky Point.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2015/08/10/4216ede7959da5237e0f6a706700c5a2_c0-214-5472-3406_s1200x700.jpg?a88f9f170498cd87bb09cf2c5330259ad352ff0d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
