The jury did find her guilty of gross abuse of a corpse, for which she will be sentenced on Friday. The charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison.\n\nThe verdict came after an eight-day trial during which jurors had to decide whether Richardson was a scared teenager who experienced a stillbirth or a cold-blooded murderer. Richardson, who sobbed when the verdict was read, was accused of killing her newborn child in 2017, when she was 18, and burying the baby in her Carlisle, Ohio, backyard.\n\nCheerleader Accused of Murdering, Burying Newborn Goes on Trial\n\nProsecutors alleged the cheerleader purposefully killed the female infant, who was born alive, \u201cbecause she did not want to be pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnwanted,\u201d Assistant Warren County Prosecutor Julie Kraft said during closing arguments on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s what Brooke Richardson\u2019s daughter was.\u201d\n\nRichardson\u2019s attorneys argued in court that the baby, whom the cheerleader named Annabelle, was born stillborn at 33 weeks. Out of fear, her lawyers said, Richardson buried the baby in the backyard. They also argued her confession to police about burning her baby was coerced.\n\nLast week, prosecutors played a recording of the 2017 police interview with Richardson.\n\n\u201cHoney, tell us what happened,\u201d her father said at the end of the interview, according to the transcript.\n\n\u201cI tried to cremate the baby,\u201d Richardson allegedly said.\n\nIn another police interview played in court last week, Richardson could be heard telling police she didn\u2019t return her doctor\u2019s calls because she was scared. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to have my baby,\u201d she told police. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what I planned to do.\u201d\n\nA psychologist testified that Richardson was sexually abused when she was 12, arguing that the trauma from that led to a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d that made her feel like she must comply with authority figures.\n\n\u201cSkylar, because of her personality disorder, has very a difficult time confronting those in authority. She has a very difficult time speaking up for herself,\u201d psychologist Dr. Stuart Bassman testified on Wednesday. \u201cWhat\u2019s most sad about this is Skylar, because of her personality disorder, is not able to protect herself. She was not able to defend herself.\u201d\n\nBassman insisted that the video of the \u201cdefenseless\u201d Richardson telling police interviewers she heard the baby making sounds after she gave birth and still burned her with a lighter proved her disorder.\n\nThe psychologist later called Richardson\u2019s second interrogation with investigators from the Warren County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u201ca clear case of intimidation.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Richardson\u2019s brother also revealed the 20-year-old suffered from an disorder, recalling that he would often catch his sister hiding her food and hearing her throw up.\n\n\u201cI just wanted her to be happy,\u201d Jackson Richardson said.\n\nThe defense also argued that the baby\u2019s development was affected by her weight and health problems.\n\nAssistant Prosecutor Steve Knippen, however, asserted in court that Richardson never wanted to have a child and worried that her lifestyle would be ruined by her pregnancy.\n\nIn court, prosecutors presented text messages Richardson allegedly sent her mom, who did not realize that her daughter was pregnant until she was questioned by police.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m literally so excited for dinner to wear something cute yayy my belly is back now I am takin this opportunity to make it amazing,\u201d she allegedly texted, just 24 hours after her baby died.\n\nRichardson then allegedly texted her mother again the day after she buried the child.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m literally speechless with how happy I am,\u201d Richardson allegedly texted. \u201cMy belly is back omg I am never ever ever evertrrr letting it grt like this again your about to see me look freaking better than before omg.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat belly was her child,\u201d Knippen said on Thursday, referencing Richardson\u2019s texts. \u201cThat belly was her daughter with fingers and toes and hair on her head. A child she tossed in the dirt.\u201d", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photo Courtesy Warren County Sheriff's OfficeThe Ohio cheerleader accused of killing her newborn baby and burying her in the backyard in an unmarked grave has been acquitted of the most serious charges against her.\u00a0Brooke Skylar Richardson, now 20, was found", "authors": ["Pilar.Melendez Thedailybeast.Com", "Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9vtUiDg2.vodI13Nx1OGfQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/1d2f065e0b3913ec909dce058bdd608b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
