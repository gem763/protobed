Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNBC reported the cash-filled life preserver involves SoftBank spending between $6 billion and $7 billion on equity and shares.\n\nAccording to the report, the deal would give Softbank \u201cas much as 70% or more\u201d control of the shared workspace company \u2014 up from about a third\u2014and would value WeWork at up to $12 billion.\n\nBloomberg reported last week that such a financing plan from SoftBank was in the works, reporting the $12 billion valuation figure at the time. That\u2019s a steep fall from the $68 billion the company was valued at during the start of the year. An earlier Bloomberg report said that JPMorgan Chase was in talks about a $7 billion debt package to bandage WeWork\u2019s dire financial problem.\n\nAccording to CNBC, SoftBank executive Marcelo Claure will step in to help manage WeWork, presumably alongside the company\u2019s co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham who took over after the company\u2019s co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann stepped down from the role amid the We Company\u2019s spectacularly bombed, and subsequently delayed, initial public offering. CNBC reports that the SoftBank deal would drop Neumann\u2019s stake to \u201clow double digits.\u201d\n\nThe bailout comes at a very tumultuous time for the company. The Guardian reported last week that the company was readying to lay off at least 2,000 people, or about 13 per cent of its workforce.\n\nThe paper reported that low morale amid uncertainty about the firings meant \u201clittle or no work is getting done\u201d at the company. One employee who spoke to the Guardian described the environment as \u201ctoxic,\u201d adding: \u201cA lot of people worked so hard for this company. We thought we were in on something really big.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for neither SoftBank nor WeWork immediately returned requests for comments. According to CNBC, official word of SoftBank\u2019s deal to take over WeWork could be announced as soon as Wednesday.", "description": "WeWork just may live to order another keg of complimentary kombucha.", "authors": ["Mack Hogan", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nzfhrjspscflooy2lu41.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
