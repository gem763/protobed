Just days after winning a record 21st medal at the competition, the superstar gymnast captured her fifth all-around world title.\n\nBiles scored 58.999 points, beating China's Tang Xijing by a whopping 2.1 points \u2014 her largest-ever margin of victory at the world championships. Russia's Angelina Melnikova was third with 56.399 points and 16-year-old American Sunisa Lee finished eighth after an unexpected fall on the uneven bars.\n\nAs she finished her floor routine, the 22-year-old American gymnast dropped an imaginary mic. \"It wasn't my best routine but we just thought it would be fun,\" she said of the move.\n\nAs Biles said, the routine was not her best performance. She stepped out of bounds twice, but her degree of difficulty was so high that those missteps still earned her the top spot.\n\nThursday's win brings Biles' all-around world titles to five, two more than any other female gymnast in history. It brings her world championship medal count up to 22 \u2014 16 of them gold \u2014 the most of any woman and just one away from Belarus' Vitaly Scherbo's men's record.\n\n\"I feel like right now actually I'm pretty confident in my gymnastics and myself and the performances I put out there, so I feel like I'm probably more confident going in today than I was at the Olympics,\" she said.\n\nNot only does Biles' victory mark her fifth, it also marks Team USA's seventh in a row in the woman's all-around, matching the Soviet Union's record streak during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nwe did the damn thing \ud83e\udd47\n\n2019 world champions pic.twitter.com/tGrnnevF2t \u2014 Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) October 9, 2019\n\nBiles has a chance to earn four more medals this weekend before the end of the competition. She'll be competing on vault and uneven bars Saturday and balance beam and floor Sunday for individual honors. She took home medals in all four of those events last year and is expected to beat Scherbo's record for most world championship medals.\n\nLast Saturday, Biles landed two new skills that had never been performed in competition. Both are expected to be named after her, bringing her total number of signature moves to four.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biles won a record 21st medal, leading her team to their fifth consecutive world team championship in what is likely Biles' last world championship.\n\n\"Every year it feels better and better just because we're adding to the legacy,\" Biles said after the team win. \"I feel like I never think of records. I just go out there and do what I came to do, which is compete for the country.\"", "description": "The superstar gymnast finished her winning floor routine with an epic mic drop", "authors": ["Sophie Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/382c24ac-5435-4c69-90df-9ed3c0dbc408/thumbnail/1200x630/9aded33f7f3f7f08d68db118a83278a0/gettyimages-1175097040.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
