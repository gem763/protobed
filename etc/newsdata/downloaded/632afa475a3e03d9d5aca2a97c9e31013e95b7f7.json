She is the sweetest, most perfect thing we have ever seen. It\u2019s a wonderful life!' Rachel wrote.\n\nIn a Facebook post, she added: 'She was born last week, one month before her due date. She is doing great, though still in the NICU until she learns to eat on her own.\n\n'I\u2019m home now, trying to recover from my first C-section (hats off to all the c-section moms out there - I had no idea!) and working hard with my breast pump to keep up with her growing appetite.\n\nRachel Campos-Duffy shared this photo of her newborn daughter, Valentina, on Tuesday. The baby was born on October 1 , a month early, in Wisconsin. She has two holes in her heart and also has Down Syndrome\n\nRachel Campos-Duffy with Valentina and some of her other eight children. Valentina will remainin the hospital for the next few weeks\n\n'When we visit with her at the hospital, the kids fight over who can hold her - I don\u2019t blame them! She\u2019s the sweetest, most perfect angel we have ever seen,' she said.\n\nCampos-Duffy went on to explain the baby's heart condition.\n\n'Valentina was born with a heart defect (2 holes in the heart and valves that need to be fixed). She will need surgery in 3-4 months.\n\n'As we suspected, Valentina was also born with an extra chromosome, which means she also has Downs Syndrome.\n\n'That extra chromosome certainly made her EXTRA cute. Life is wonderful!!'\n\nCampos-Duffy then thanked 'everyone who prayed' for the infant.\n\nBefore her birth, her father announced he was resigning from his seat in Wisconsin in order to spend more time with his family.\n\nThe couple both appeared on MTV's The Real World and married in 1999. Sean had a busy TV career before launching himself into politics.\n\nHe was serving as the Wisconsin's 7th district representative until September, when the pair learned ahead of Valentina's birth that she would be born with a hole in her heart.\n\nDuffy was serving in Wisconsin's 7th District but he gave him his position earlier this year\n\nThe couple already have eight other children; Evita Pilar, Xavier Jack, Lucia-Belen, John-Paul, Paloma Pilar, MariaVictoria Margarita, Margarita Pilar, and Patrick Miguel\n\nIt prompted his resignation.\n\n'Recently, we've learned that our baby, due in late October, will need even more love, time, and attention due to complications, including a heart condition.\n\n'With much prayer, I have decided that this is the right time for me to take a break from public service in order to be the support my wife, baby and family need right now. It is not an easy decision \u2013 because I truly love being your Congressman \u2013 but it is the right decision for my family, which is my first love and responsibility,' he said.\n\nHe was supported by President Trump - whose 2016 presidential campaign he enthusiastically backed - and a handful of other Republicans.\n\nDuffy met his future wife on the set of MTV's 'Road Rules: All Stars' in 1999.\n\nThe two had appeared separately on Real World programs for the music network. Duffy was on The Real World: Boston and Campos-Duffy was on The Real World: San Francisco.\n\nDuffy is an enthusiastic Trump supporter.
