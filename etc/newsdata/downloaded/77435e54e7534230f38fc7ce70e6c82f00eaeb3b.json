EU leaders meeting in Brussels reiterated their call early on Friday for Turkey to end its assault, while noting the pause in the offensive.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted to journalists in Ankara that Turkey was \"suspending the operation, not halting it\".\n\n\"This is not a ceasefire. A ceasefire is reached between the two legitimate parties.\"\n\nAnkara considers YPG militants to be an extension the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - a group that has fought a bloody insurgency inside Turkey for 35 years.\n\nTrump hailed the deal, reached after more than four hours of talks led by Pence, as \"a great day for civilisation\".\n\n\"I want to thank the Kurds, because they were incredibly happy with this solution,\" he said during a visit to Texas. \"This is a solution that really - well it saved their lives, frankly.\"\n\nA day after the leak of a letter in which Trump warned Erdogan not to be a \"fool\", Trump hailed the Turkish president as \"a friend of mine\", adding: \"He's a hell of a leader.\"\n\nErdogan on Twitter called for action to \"defeat terrorism\", saying \"I am confident this joint effort will promote peace and stability in our region\".\n\nErdogan, who like Trump has faced political setbacks at home, found wide domestic support for the operation.\n\nBut Trump faced accusations even from usual supporters that his withdrawal of 1 000 US troops - practically the entire US contingent in the region - betrayed Kurdish militants who bore the brunt of the fight against the Islamic State group in recent years.\n\nTrump quickly faced renewed attacks over the deal.\n\n\"President Trump's decision to help Turkey push the Kurds out of their home in northern Syria after all they have done to help the US defeat ISIS is outrageous,\" said Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat.\n\nErdogan to head to Russia\n\nErdogan wants to destroy Kurdish hopes of an autonomous enclave that Turkey fears could serve as a launchpad for attacks on its soil.\n\nHe also wants to resettle some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees Ankara is hosting.\n\nJeffrey said Turkey had promised that its presence in the zone would be short, insisting that the United States still recognised Syria's territorial integrity.\n\n\"The Turks have reassured us many times that they have no intention - no intention whatsoever, from President Erdogan personally on down today - of staying in Syria very long,\" he said.\n\nThe US pullout has strengthened both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who for the first time sent troops to the northeast in an agreement with Kurdish forces, and Russia - Assad's main backer.\n\nErdogan will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday - when the five-day period will come to an end - in the Black Sea resort of Sochi as both sides seek to prevent a war between Turkey and Syria.", "description": "Turkey has agreed to suspend its Syria offensive for five days and will end the assault if Kurdish-led forces withdraw from a safe zone along the border, US Vice President Mike Pence and Turkish officials announced after high-stakes talks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9367/d9335113cc4e47bf9457b964123b5d84.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
