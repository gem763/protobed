But he sent a letter to the EU on Saturday to ask for an extension as required by a previous bill passed by MPs. He also sent a second letter stating his personal lack of appetite for such an extension.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson warned MPs that if they voted against the timetable to push the Brexit deal through parliament this week he will pull the legislation and call a snap election.\n\nRead More: Watch live: UK PM Johnson says he will pull Brexit bill if he loses timetable vote", "description": "'No justification, at this stage' for a new Brexit extension, says France's foreign minister.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/09/76/1000x563_cmsv2_77e464fd-3537-54e2-b2e3-e89224806626-4250976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
