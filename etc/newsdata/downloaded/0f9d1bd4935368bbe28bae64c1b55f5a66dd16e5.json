The president\u2019s brazen attempt to use a major international event to promote a family business with declining revenue \u2014 announced in the middle of an impeachment inquiry and a significant self-created diplomatic crisis in Syria \u2014 did not go over as well as Trump and his advisers apparently assumed, and even drew criticism from typical Trump allies on Fox News and in Congress.\n\n\u201cWe will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately,\u201d the president said late Saturday.\n\nTrump had publicly promoted the idea of hosting the G7 at his Miami-area resort for months, and as luck would have it, event planners at the White House did some due diligence and determined that the president\u2019s awesome boasts about the venue were accurate. \u201cI was aware of the political, sort of, criticism that we\u2019d come under for doing it at Doral,\u201d acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney claimed on Thursday, \u201cwhich is why I was so surprised when the advance team called back and said that this is the perfect physical location to do this.\u201d\n\nIt also led to a perfect political firestorm, which forced Trump to give up his G7 fantasy in a matter of days.\n\nIn a three-tweet statement announcing the reversal, the president insisted the outrage was \u201cbased on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility\u201d \u2014 but he also took the chance to promote Doral one last time and claim that ditching the venue would be America\u2019s big loss:\n\nI thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders. It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\n\n(The claim that the Trump Corporation would not profit from hosting the event is not only false, it\u2019s preposterous \u2014 the free advertising alone would have been a priceless opportunity for the Trump clan.)\n\nA waitress passes out Trump-branded water bottles at Trump Doral in 2014.

It\u2019s like, I used to be in the real-estate business. I don\u2019t know what you used to do before you were in the media.\n\nWALLACE: Nothing. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever done.\n\nMULVANEY: Yes. But he wanted to put on a show. He wanted to take care of folks. That\u2019s the business \u2014 he\u2019s in the hotel business or at least he was before he was the president.\n\nWALLACE: Does he understand \u2014 forget the media \u2014 does he understand that it looked lousy?\n\nMULVANEY: Well, I think he knows. He thinks people think it looks lousy.\n\nAnd both of them felt compelled to walk right into the fire anyway. Mulvaney held Thursday\u2019s press conference to announce the G7 venue, as he and other administration staff had to know how \u201clousy\u201d the choice would seem politically. But Mulvaney managed to upstage the G7 news during the Q&A when he acknowledged that President Trump had sought a quid pro quo from the president of Ukraine in exchange for releasing U.S. aid to the country \u2014 a contradiction of the White House\u2019s official position on a matter that is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nHe never would have been in that situation if Trump hadn\u2019t needed two days of pushback to realize the folly of his G7 ploy. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that if we made the decision [to skip the Doral resort] on Thursday, we wouldn\u2019t have had the press conference on Thursday regarding everything else, but that\u2019s fine,\u201d Mulvaney remarked during his Fox News Sunday Interview. (The decision was apparently so impulsive that the mayor of Doral, Florida, hadn\u2019t even been informed before Mulvaney made the announcement.)\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his kids/business partners during the grand opening of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, on October 26, 2016.

Indeed, Politico reported on Sunday that Trump advertised his clubs and resorts more than anyone had realized:\n\nTrump constantly brags about his properties around the globe when he speaks with foreign leaders in person or by phone, even more than the public instances witnessed out in the open, according to three people familiar with Trump\u2019s conversations with foreign officials. The remarks are permeating every membrane of his presidency so much that they\u2019ve left aides and allies mastering verbal jiu-jitsu to defend his unprecedented approach to fusing personal business interests with his position in high office.\n\nThe interactions have led House Democrats \u2014 who have already launched an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump is illegally profiting off the presidency \u2014 and sometimes even his own staff to question whether his namesake businesses are influencing U.S. foreign policy.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, the executive director of the watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, made a related point in response to Trump\u2019s about-face to save face on Saturday:\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to award the G-7 Conference to his own property was outrageous, corrupt and a constitutional violation. It was stunningly corrupt even for a stunningly corrupt administration. His reversal of that decision is a bow to reality, but does not change how astonishing it was that a president ever thought this was appropriate, or that it was something he could get away with.\n\nThe President\u2019s reversal shows that pressure works, that those fighting to hold the line for an ethical government can still sometimes dial down his corruption. The president deserves no plaudits for doing the right thing only after public outcry forced him not to do the wrong thing. This was one corrupt conflict of interest. He\u2019s racked up well over 2,000 of them.\n\nAnd there will be many more before he leaves office, only less egregious than the Doral fiasco. If Trump picks Camp David for the G7, the Trump International Hotel in Washington will be less than 70 miles away.", "description": "President Trump announced Saturday that he will not host the 2020 G7 at his golf resort in Doral, Florida.
