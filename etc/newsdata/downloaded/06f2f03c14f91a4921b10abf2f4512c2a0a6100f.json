I'm not in tabloids, I didn't get it. So, it's been complicated,\" she added.\n\nThe couple's first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on May 6, with the couple choosing not to use a royal title for him. Asked by presenter Tom Bradby about the impact of press intrusion on her mental and physical health, the Duchess said:\n\n\"Any woman, especially when you're pregnant, you're really vulnerable, so that was made really challenging. And then when you have a new born, and especially as a woman it's really, it's a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom, trying to be a newly-wed, and also thank you for asking because not many people have asked if I'm OK, but it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"\n\n\"And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really OK, as in it's really been a struggle?\" Bradby asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" the Duchess answered.", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, has said that her British friends warned her against marrying Prince Harry, because of British tabloid press intrusion.", "authors": ["Lucy Handley"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106192929-1571660133550gettyimages-1176009693.jpeg?v=1571660173", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
