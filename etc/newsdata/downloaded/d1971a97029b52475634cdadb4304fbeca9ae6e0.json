The options-based gauge traded at Cboe Global Markets Inc. tends to fall when the S&P 500 is rising, and vice versa.\n\nFriday is so-called quadruple witching, which occurs four times a year and refers to the day that options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire at the same time.\n\nSome investors and analysts say the simultaneous expiration can spur greater volatility in markets as volumes pick up. The day tends to boost trading activity because investors readjust expiring positions. Investors sometimes choose to roll over their positions so that they expire later in time or close them entirely.\n\nOptions give investors the right to buy or sell shares of stock at a specific price, later in time. Calls confer the right to buy, while puts give the right to sell.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s often increased volume and volatility,\u201d said Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research and analytics at FactSet .\n\nA number of indexes, including the S&P 500, S&P 400 and S&P 600, were scheduled to rebalance Friday, another factor that was expected to drive higher trading volumes.\n\nTraders in the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) pit last year.
