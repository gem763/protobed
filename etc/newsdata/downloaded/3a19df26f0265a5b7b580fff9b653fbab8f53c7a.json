Clinton lampooned for claiming space agency ENDED her childhood dreams of becoming astronaut", "language": "en", "text": "Twitter users have launched dozens of snarky memes into digital orbit after Hillary Clinton recounted how NASA had crushed her childhood dream of becoming an astronaut.\n\nMarking the first all-woman spacewalk, Clinton illustrated just how far gender equality has come in the last 60 years.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a little girl, I wrote to NASA and told them I dreamed of being an astronaut. They wrote back and said they weren\u2019t taking girls,\u201d the former presidential candidate tweeted, because apparently everything has to be about her. She then expressed hope that a \u201cnew generation of little girls\u201d will be able to reach for the stars.\n\nWhen I was a little girl, I wrote to NASA and told them I dreamed of being an astronaut.\n\n\n\nThey wrote back and said they weren't taking girls.\n\n\n\nA new generation of little girls watched today's historic spacewalk. May their dreams of reaching the stars have no bounds. https://t.co/MRR9OVmou7 \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 18, 2019\n\nSocial media users immediately began to pick apart the rather far-fetched tale.\n\nOne top reply correctly noted that Clinton was born in 1947, more than 10 years before NASA was founded. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t until 1962 that the US put an astronaut in space \u2013 making her story hard to believe.\n\nYou were born in 1947, NASA wasn't formed until 1958 and we didn't have an astronaut in space until until 1962 when you were 15 years old.\n\n\n\nYou didn't write a letter to NASA when you were a little girl and you should definitely stop drunk tweeting. https://t.co/6bTN8t9D4R \u2014 Oregon Designer (@Easycure) October 19, 2019\n\nOthers pointed to Clinton\u2019s previous tall tales that were later proven to be demonstrably false, including her claim that she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to reach the summit of Mount Everest.\n\nGiven Clinton\u2019s shaky track record when it comes to keeping documents, several suspicious netizens demanded to see the alleged rejection letter.\n\nThe response to her childhood story wasn\u2019t completely negative, however. If Clinton is still interested in going into space, that could certainly be arranged \u2013 on condition that she stays there, a generous Twitter user suggested.\n\nWell, it's not too late for us to blast you off to space and leave you there. Your dream will be fulfilled! \u2014 Kate Schneider (@Kate_Anon) October 18, 2019\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
