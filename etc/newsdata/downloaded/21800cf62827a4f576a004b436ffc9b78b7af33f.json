The report says that aid investments in health and education - also known as human capital - should be targeted at girls and those \u201ccountries and districts that have to make up the most ground\u201d.\n\nThe Goalkeepers 2019 report shows that the world has made good progress against two of the goals - cutting child mortality and increasing the number of years schooling the world\u2019s children undertake.\n\nBut the world is off track on nearly every indicator the report looks at - particularly in terms of beating the world\u2019s three biggest infectious disease killers, HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.\n\nMr Gates, founder of Microsoft and one of the world's richest men, said: \u201cAlmost half a billion people live in communities without access to health and education. Where you\u2019re born and what gender you are has a major effect on this global inequality.\u201d\n\nThe report, launched as the leaders of the world gather at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, highlights Chad, in the Sahel region of Africa, a country where more children die in a single day than in a whole year in Finland.\n\nBut a girl born in Chad faces even greater hurdles: in the womb and as a young baby she is unlikely to have got the right nutrients to help her develop which means she may be stunted; she probably cannot read or write and is likely to have been pregnant by the time she is 20.\n\nThe report says: \u201cShe deserves a better life. And we believe she can have one, as long as the world understands the many challenges she faces and gets to work on addressing them.\u201d\n\nThe report shows how in Sub Saharan Africa girls undertake two years less education than boys, do three times more unpaid work than boys and are less likely to be in the workplace - there are 24 per cent more men in the workforce than women.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Aid spending on health and education\u00a0should be targeted at girls and\u00a0countries where the gender equality gap is greatest, Bill Gates has said.", "authors": ["Anne Gulland"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/caMwIzPIuVLg2JcJkdDyFQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/fe76a7a68c69923a096ff67b5f5d2cb7", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
