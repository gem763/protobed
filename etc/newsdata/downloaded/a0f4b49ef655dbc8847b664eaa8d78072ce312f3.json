They were apparently being held by cartel-linked smugglers until they could pay for the right to cross the Rio Grande.\n\nThe rescue took place over the weekend in Reynosa when agents from Mexico\u2019s National Migration Institute requested help from the country\u2019s new National Guard. Federal authorities raided the house and found 32 migrants from Guatemala, 10 from El Salvador, two from Honduras, and one from Nicaragua. Nineteen of those were under the age of 18.\n\nAuthorities did not report the arrest of any cartel-linked human smugglers at the house. Preliminary information suggests the migrants were held until they could pay the necessary fees to be smuggled into Texas. The Gulf Cartel has taken control of the human smuggling operations in and around South Texas. Cartel-connected smugglers force Central Americans to pay various fees even if they have official visas or travel permits.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
