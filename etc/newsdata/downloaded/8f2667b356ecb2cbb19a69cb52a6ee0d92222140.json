Three candidates \u2015 tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and activist Tom Steyer \u2015 participated in the event.\n\nDuring the event, candidates took the stage individually, taking questions from moderators and audience members and addressing issues that weigh heavily on the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, including immigration and income inequality.\n\nYang ended up making headlines at the forum for crowdsurfing, riding atop a sea of his own supporters, who have been dubbed the #YangGang. In addition to his main proposal of universal basic income, the candidate also touched on climate change, among other issues. He called for further investment in renewable energy as well as relocating people from residents from areas with rising sea levels.\n\nAlong with his platform, the presidential hopeful, who\u2019s Asian American himself, opened up about the bullying he had received in his younger years due to his race. He said that, as the son of Taiwanese immigrants, \u201cYou feel like your spot in this country is somewhat in question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was one of the only Asian kids in my town and that made me feel like i had to prove myself a lot. I got, I guess you\u2019d call it, bullied a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI got called \u2018chink\u2019 and \u2018gook\u2019 regularly and I felt like I had a choice at that time to either take it or fight, and so I decided to fight and I ... was very skinny so I would lose most all of those fights.\u201d\n\nGabbard, an Iraq War veteran, called for the end of \u201cwasteful, counterproductive wars.\u201d The lawmaker said that she would meet with the Taliban \u201cunder the right circumstance that would further our national security\u201d and called on the for the end of the U.S.\u2019 role as \u201cthe world\u2019s police.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman also said she\u2019d protect LGBTQ rights and work to lift the travel ban.\n\nTom Steyer, a billionaire philanthropist, explained to the crowd that, as a presidential hopeful, he is largely focused on climate change. He announced that, if elected, he would declare a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d on his first day in office.\n\nWhile explaining his involvement in the political sphere, Steyer assured the audience that \u201cit isn\u2019t like I just came to [politics].\u201d The billionaire, who founded political advocacy group NextGen America, explained he\u2019d spent years advocating for tobacco taxes and clean energy among other causes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 10 years,\u201d he said.\n\nVarun Nikore, president of one of the forum\u2019s organizing groups, AAPI Victory Fund, told HuffPost that he felt more presidential hopefuls should\u2019ve taken the opportunity to reach Asian American voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that candidates can\u2019t be more straight with a constituency group that is the fastest-growing constituency group in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nNikore told HuffPost that while he felt the event was a success, campaigns have a long way to go before they\u2019ve proven they value the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. He noted that he was disappointed the other candidates did not take the opportunity to speak to an important constituency, calling their inability to show up an \u201cepic fail.\u201d\n\nResearch shows that in battleground states, Asian Americans have the power to flip districts. Analysis from AAPI Data shows that during last year\u2019s midterm elections, the racial group had the ability to make significant impacts in 27 congressional districts across 11 states.\n\nNikore argued that, given the crowded Democratic field, presidential hopefuls should be putting in further efforts to speak to Asian Americans as every last vote counts. The AAPI Victory Fund president said that even as candidates attempt to clinch majority-white states like Iowa and New Hampshire, constituents of color could could make a difference in ranking with so many individuals in the running.\n\n\u201cDo you not think that you have to fight for every last sliver of the votes and microtarget every last voter, every last ethnicity, every last demographic?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe added that the forum was also significant in that it featured three Asian American hosts: MSNBC\u2019s Richard Liu and Ester Lee and author Viet Nguyen. Two rounds of Democratic debates have occurred, and each adhered to the DNC request that at least one woman and one person of color serve as moderators. However not a single one has featured an Asian American or Pacific Islander host thus far.\n\nIn August, the Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders Rising & Empowering (ASPIRE) political action committee issued a letter to Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, demanding representation from the community on the debate stage in future debates.\n\n\u201cUnder your leadership, there are more Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) holding senior positions at the DNC than at any other time in the organization\u2019s history,\u201d the letter read. \u201cAn important way to further this commitment to our community would be to ensure that at least one of the DNC-sponsored presidential debates features an AAPI moderator.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Nikore said that Asian American and Pacific Islander groups will be holding candidates\u2019 \u201cfeet to the fire\u201d and demanding they do a better job of outreach to the community.", "description": "All candidates were invited, but only Andrew Yang, Rep.
