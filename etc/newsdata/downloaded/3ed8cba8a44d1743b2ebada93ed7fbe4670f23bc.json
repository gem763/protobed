(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Sean Doolittle was in the tunnel stretching, as he usually does around the fifth inning, loosening his arm in the shadows of a sold-out Dodger Stadium, when he heard a voice.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d it said with a familiar sharpness, and so Doolittle whipped around to see Max Scherzer closing in. \u201cHow do I get to the bullpen?\u201d\n\nDoolittle felt his mouth drop and didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he pointed, guiding Scherzer into the stadium, giving legs to a plan the Washington Nationals had been plotting for days. On Friday night, in Game 2 of the National League Division Series, Dave Martinez managed as if this club couldn\u2019t lose. And it didn\u2019t, taking a 4-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, and telling its opponent that every hand \u2014 no, every last finger \u2014 is on deck.\n\n[The Nationals are breaking the rules, and just might steal the series from the Dodgers]\n\nStephen Strasburg, only two days removed from a 34-pitch relief appearance, threw six innings and gave up one run. Doolittle, the closer for most of this season, had the seventh and allowed a solo home run. Then came Scherzer, once slated to start Game 3 on Sunday, to strike out the side in the eighth. Then came Daniel Hudson. who worked out of a bases-loaded jam in a cover-your-eyes ninth.\n\nThe formula was creative. It was crazy. And it worked, from the first out to the 27th, to put pressure on the favored Dodgers with an even series swinging east for Sunday\u2019s Game 3.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to slice it up the rest of the way,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cBut we\u2019re feeling good with a chance to go back to D.C. with a chance to win at home.\u201d\n\nThis approach didn\u2019t start brewing Friday. It didn\u2019t even start brewing this past week. It began in May, before this season turned around, when Trea Turner came off the injured list and could only use nine fingers. The 10th, his right index, was broken on April 2 and was barely functional. But the message spread in the clubhouse. About a month later, in the guts of June, Scherzer threw six scoreless innings with a broken nose.\n\nEveryone noticed. Rest was no longer an option. The team later printed shirts that read: \u201cDay off? [Expletive] that.\u201d So when the postseason arrived, and the stakes skyrocketed, Scherzer and Strasburg kept it going. Strasburg told Martinez that he wanted to come out of the bullpen in Tuesday\u2019s wild-card game. He did, and threw three scoreless innings to set up a comeback in the eighth. Then Scherzer was in Martinez\u2019s office Thursday, before Game 1 against the Dodgers, lobbying for a relief appearance. One player recalled Scherzer \u201cpretty much begging\u201d to get in ahead of his next start.\n\nMartinez never sought out the star pitchers. He never had to.\n\n\u201cYou can be thrown right into the mix whenever,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThere is no routine in the postseason. There is no routine right now. It\u2019s come to the park ready to compete.\u201d\n\nThe relievers first heard the Scherzer rumblings during batting practice Friday. Scherzer\u2019s public account is that was when he spoke with Martinez about possibly coming out of the pen. But the front office and coaching staff had been considering the move all week. The Nationals have a large gap between their stacked rotation and Hudson and Doolittle. They are the only two reliable relievers. The rest \u2014 Tanner Rainey, Fernando Rodney, Hunter Strickland, Wander Suero \u2014 are becoming less viable by the appearance. The Nationals got to this point despite that glaring vulnerability.\n\n[Juan Soto is a very quick learner. Just listen to his English.]\n\nThe club had watched a combination of Rainey, Rodney and Strickland yield four runs in the final three innings of Game 1. It deflated the Nationals in a 6-0 loss. So Martinez committed to throwing the house at the Dodgers before leaving town. He sent Scherzer down to the pen in the fifth, planning to fire his best bullet, and the ace arrived in time to slump into a folding chair and chat with the relievers. Doolittle recalled Scherzer as \u201cmuch calmer\u201d than when he came out of the bullpen during the 2017 playoffs. Aaron Barrett described him as a \u201cmad dog in a cage.\u201d It was mythmaking in real time.\n\nJavy Guerra thought that Scherzer was ready from the moment he got there. He saw it in the 35-year-old\u2019s piercing eyes. Then Guerra, who\u2019s not on the NLDS roster, stopped mid-sentence to offer an unsolicited thought: \u201cThe whole thing was genius.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce Stras went six I didn\u2019t know if we were going to use Max; I was a little disappointed,\u201d said Doolittle. But the lefty peeked back out at the bullpen after he recorded the second out of the seventh. \u201cI had a small window where I could see who was warming. It was him. I thought: \u2018Oh, let\u2019s [expletive] go.\u2019\u201d\n\nScherzer came out firing 99 mph fastballs. He later called it \u201cadrenaline\u201d rather than emptying the tank for the single inning. He struck out rookie Gavin Lux with a back-foot cutter. He got Chris Taylor swinging at a slider below the zone. He then set down Joc Pederson on three pitches, the last one a cutter, and made it seem like he could go one more.\n\nBut both Martinez and Scherzer thought ahead. The manager had already used Doolittle earlier than he had all season. He already plugged Scherzer into the eighth. He finally reached for some normalcy, calling down for Hudson for the ninth, and Scherzer agreed with a Game 3 start still in play. The other option is pitching An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez for the first time since Sept. 25.\n\n\u201cIf I were to go out there and pitch the ninth, it would really be taxing, given the situation and the moment,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThat could hinder how effective I could be in the future, considering everything at play. We have Huddy. Huddy is a closer. Let him close.\u201d\n\n[12 best moments of Nationals\u2019 wild season]\n\nHudson allowed a leadoff double to Justin Turner. He rebounded to strike out A.J. Pollock on a full-count slider. He recorded the second out when Anthony Rendon made a falling-down catch along the left-field line. But then Martinez intentionally walked Max Muncy to set up a right-righty matchup with Will Smith. That put the tying run on base with two outs. That was playing with fire and gasoline. Then Hudson walked Smith, on four pitches, and this had all the makings of another bullpen disaster.\n\nCatcher Kurt Suzuki visited Hudson once to make sure Turner wasn\u2019t stealing signs off second. He came again after Hudson threw ball four to Smith. Then he came again while Corey Seager battled Hudson, fouling off five four-seamers at 96 mph or faster, to ask what Hudson wanted to throw for the kill. Suzuki suggested a fastball or change-up. Hudson had yanked three sliders against Smith that weren\u2019t close to the zone. But Hudson wanted to throw a slider on the plate once the fastball was imprinted in Seager\u2019s brain.\n\nAnd once he did, once Seager swung and missed it, once Hudson was screaming in front of the mound and the stadium fell into a hush, the creative and crazy plan was complete. The series was tied. The Nationals gave themselves a chance.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nBoswell: The Nats picked wrong time to show the worst of themselves in Game 1 of NLDS\n\nSvrluga: The Nats took a questionable offensive approach in Game 1.
