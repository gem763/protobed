This is a new stage in an already dangerous presidency.\u201d\n\nIn the eight-page letter, the White House accused top Democrats of trying to use the impeachment investigation into Trump to overturn the 2016 election result. It also announced it would not cooperate with the inquiry, which it declared \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president does not get to decide which congressional actions are legitimate and, therefore, which congressional commands he accepts,\u201d the Post wrote, adding: \u201cIf members of Congress \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 do not flatly reject Mr. Trump\u2019s letter, they will humiliate themselves and shred the constitutional order. They cannot allow the president to say that the law is not the law.\u201d", "description": "\"It's tempting to ignore Trump\u2019s unhinged letter to Congress.
