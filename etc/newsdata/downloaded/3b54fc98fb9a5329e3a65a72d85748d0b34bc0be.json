Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, estimated trade would shave about 0.2 percentage point from the annualized growth rate in the July to September period.\n\nImports grew 0.5% in August from July, driven by a 3.4% increase in consumer goods imports on the month to $57.23 billion, the highest level on record. Imports of cellphones alone were up 13.3% in August from July, Commerce reported.\n\nU.S. exports were up 0.2%, driven by a 3.4% increase in exports of industrial supplies, particularly fuel oil. Automobile exports also rose 2.7% to $14.28 billion, the highest level since July 2014.\n\nThe report also highlights the diverging economic outlooks between U.S. households and businesses, particularly manufacturers. Household spending remains relatively strong. It grew 2.3% in August over the previous year after adjusting for inflation, the Commerce Department reported in September.\n\nFactories, on the other hand, are struggling. Imports of industrial supplies, mostly commodities, declined 3.3% in August from July and are down 8.3% over the first eight months of 2019 versus the same period in 2018. Imports of capital goods such as computers or machines ticked up slightly in August but remain down about 1% year-to-date.\n\nAn index of new orders for manufacturing exports has pointed to declining activity for three straight months and in September hit the lowest level since March 2009, according to the Institute for Supply Management. That could signal a decline in overall exports in the September trade report, expected Nov. 5.\n\nOverall factory activity also fell for the second straight month, the group said, which has led U.S. firms to cut back on orders from overseas suppliers.\n\nSimilar surveys in Europe and Asia released earlier this week also pointed to a manufacturing slowdown.\n\nThat has been holding down U.S. exports of manufacturing equipment. Capital goods exports are down 1.6% so far in 2019 over the same period in 2018. That decline is mostly driven by a fall in exports of civilian aircraft, a possible consequence of the grounds of Boeing 737 MAX.\n\nThe bleak global trade picture could persist through the end of the year. On Tuesday, the World Trade Organization said it expected international trade in goods to grow by just 1.2% this year, the lowest annual increase since 2009.\n\nMuch of that outlook is due to the continuing trade war between the U.S. and China. The Trump administration has imposed a series of increasingly steep tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, causing China to retaliate. Talks have so far not produced a comprehensive agreement. The two sides are set to meet again this month.\n\nThe U.S. said Wednesday it would impose tariffs on $7.5 billion in aircraft, food products and other goods from the European Union after the World Trade Organization authorized the levies Wednesday, citing the EU's subsidies to Airbus SE.\n\nWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 12:33 ET (16:33 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
