The company may be one of the most obvious examples of the blurry lines between public service and private enterprise in China.\n\nWith the U.S. - China trade war buffeting markets, American investors may be curious about China. But what\u2019s the right approach?\n\nYou can choose from China \u201cbull\u201d YINN, +3.72% or \u201cbear\u201d YANG, -3.50% funds, or slice and dice the country\u2019s economy into sectors \u2013 health care CHIH, -0.09% , technology CQQQ, +0.33% , biopharma, and more.\n\nBut you might also consider an approach that confronts China for what it is: a exchange-traded fund that strips out the notoriously opaque Communist government-owned enterprises, allowing investors to focus their money on private companies instead.\n\nThe investment thesis behind that ETF, the WisdomTree China Ex-State-Owned Enterprises CXSE, +0.32% is straightforward: \u201cprivate corporations are run more efficiently and act in the best interests of shareholders rather than the state.\u201d\n\nThe reality is anything but.\n\nLeland Miller is CEO and co-founder of the China Beige Book, a unique research firm that uses industry data from sources inside the company to compile a more granular \u2013 and honest \u2013 profile of the economy and business conditions than the government provides. In China, \u201cThere\u2019s no clear-cut line between state-owned enterprises and private firms,\u201d Miller told MarketWatch.\n\nRelated: A China skeptic takes a victory lap as unwanted steel floods the market\n\nWisdomTree says it defines \u201cstate-owned\u201d as \u201cgovernment ownership of greater than 20%,\u201d but Miller argues that it\u2019s more complicated than that.\n\nSome companies that operate as private firms are in turn owned by state-owned enterprises, Miller pointed out. \u201cA lot of private firms have Communist party members on their board,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers are just dominated indirectly. One example is Huawei, which serves the will of the state.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more challenging is the question of whether the ETF\u2019s thesis is even correct.\n\nMiller said he finds the idea \u201cweird.\u201d While Chinese state-owned enterprises have a reputation for, in his words, \u201coverwhelmingly underperforming private firms because the state is a less market-savvy actor than private firms trying to maximize profit,\u201d he also points out that that\u2019s precisely the wrong way to look at the situation.\n\nChinese state-owned enterprises exist to perform functions outside of profit-making. Some, like housing authorities, may be familiar to American investors. Others, like the institutions known as China\u2019s \u201cBig 4 Commerical banks\u201d may be less so: private in name, public in spirit.\n\nIn fact, if the Chinese economy turns down sharply, whether because of the trade war or not, state-owned enterprises may do better than private ones. They receive favorable treatment, such as access to capitaland their heavy concentrations of workers make them politically important.\n\nSee: Here\u2019s an investing strategy that smooths out some market ups and downs\n\nThat\u2019s a good reminder that investors should know what their own priorities are when deploying money anywhere, notes Eric Hsueh, the director of investment research at Cornerstone Capital Group.\n\nFor someone with a high conviction that investing in China is a money-maker, there are broad ETFs that passively track strategies like the MSCI China Index for low fees. But if your intent is to invest more impactfully, it may be better to look for an active manager who can do due diligence on how companies in the fund are run, and perhaps even nudge managers to adopt best practices that would make them more profitable.\n\nHsueh also notes that historical performance for the WisdomTree China Ex-State-Owned Enterprises CXSE, +0.32% ETF, which launched in 2012, has been strong: it\u2019s gained 13.6% over the past three years, according to FactSet data. But that\u2019s mainly because it\u2019s been a great few years for some of the big private Chinese companies that make up the fund, like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, +0.11% and Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, +1.89% , which together account for nearly one-quarter of the holdings.\n\nThat streak may well continue. Or it may not. Those calculations are made much more knotty by the ongoing trade war, Hsueh pointed out. His firm has moved to an underweight position on emerging markets, broadly, in the short term, though he thinks long-term dynamics, like demographics, make the space attractive over the long term.\n\nRead: Do well by doing good with this fund that supports freedom and human rights", "description": "One ETF that purports to offer access to better run private sector companies in China that are better run may make things more confusing for investors, not...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR041_huawei_ZG_20190910163216.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
