At Flushing Meadows, she fell to a first-time grand slam finalist in Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu.\n\nWilliams may not need statistics to prove her standing in the game but Mouratoglou is confident she has plenty of gas in the tank to continue her pursuit next season.\n\n\u201cI think time is working for her,\u201d Mouratoglou told Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cI think she was much better at the US Open than she was at Wimbledon, and Wimbledon (was) better than Roland Garros.\n\n\u201cShe is getting back in shape, and the more in shape she will be, the more dangerous she will be. I think she has started to play really good tennis.\u201d\n\nMouratoglou said Williams must play without the pressure of having to solidify her place in tennis history.\n\n\u201cThis is the highest pressure anyone can have in life, and on the other side of the court she plays girls who have zero pressure because it is their first final,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some point, she will figure out how to deal with that.\u201d", "description": "Patrick Mouratoglou is confident that Serena Williams has plenty of gas in the tank to continue her pursuit of Margaret Court\u2019s record next season", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e788ffa1218c8bc31e0ea825a14858ba485bbdc3/0_17_2472_1483/master/2472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ce9952e9258830861cdfbbbf4931db1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
