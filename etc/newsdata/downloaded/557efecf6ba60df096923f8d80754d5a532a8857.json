For a survey of driving habits claims they are spending an average of 13 hours a year driving their children to social events.\n\nThe figure comes in research for an insurance company that also reckons Britons are spending a total of more than two years of their lives in cars.\n\nEach year motorists spend a total of 33 hours driving to and from the supermarket and 35 hours driving to meet friends and family \u2013 on top of the 13 hours spent as the \u2018taxi of mum and dad\u2019.\n\nRoad rage: Motorists spend over three weeks of their lives shouting and swearing at other drivers\n\nTopping them all, however, is the 63 hours a year simply commuting to and from work in the car.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad. For many people, the car is a sanctuary.\n\nThe research, by Privilege Car Insurance, found that nearly six out of ten (59 per cent) motorists agree that driving is a great opportunity for some thinking time, and more than half (52 per cent) are glad to have a break from their phones.\n\nA third (33 per cent) agree that time alone in the car offers them some welcome respite from their children.\n\nOn average, Britons spend 293 hours per year in their car.\n\nPeople from Plymouth spend the most time in their cars \u2013 a total of 416 hours per year, whilst people from Brighton spend the least time, 232 hours per year.\n\nInstead of finding being in the car a chore, nearly nine out of ten (86 per cent) are enjoying the radio, with two thirds of drivers (67 per cent) confessing to singing along to music at the top of their voice.\n\nPop hits take the top spot for singalong choice, with rock, power ballads and \u2018R&B\u2019 tracks also making the list.\n\nTop 10 time consuming activities that have Britons in cars for 293 hours ever year 1. Commuting to work: 63 hours a year 2. Driving to meet family or friends: 35 hours a year 3. Driving to the supermarket: 33 hours a year 4. Going out to do household errands: 32 hours a year 5.

Plymouth: 416 hours a year 2. London: 393 hours a year 3. Liverpool: 357 hours a year 4. Norwich: 341 hours a year 5. Glasgow: 333 hours a year 6. Leeds: 333 hours a year 7.
