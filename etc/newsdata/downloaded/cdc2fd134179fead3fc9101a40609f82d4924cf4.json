(Orlando Ramirez/USA Today Sports)\n\nDespite lots of drama and uncertainty after the last blow was thrown Saturday in Mexico City, the UFC main event contest between Yair Rodriguez and Jeremy Stephens was technically over just 15 seconds after it began. The two faced-off and exchanged blows briefly before Rodriguez followed up a kick of his by raking the eyes of Stephens with his left hand.\n\nStephens immediately reacted to the banned eye-gouge, and referee Herb Dean stepped in to halt the fight and look Stephens over. The fight would never re-start.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDean calmly and sagely instructed Stephens to take time to let his eye relax a bit before attempting to open it and having doctors look at it, telling him he had five minutes to attempt to recover from the illegal move after \u201cLil Heathen\u201d told the official that Rodriguez had \u201cgot me good.\u201d\n\nJeremy Stephens is escorted by security out of the Octagon on Saturday in Mexico City. (Orlando Ramirez/USA Today Sports)\n\nDean also took control when the cageside physician entered, and let the doctor know that he recommended that Stephens be given a full five minutes to attempt to open his eye for examination, unless the doctor believed the fighter needed immediate attention.\n\nAfter Stephens was unable to open his eye on his own even after all that time had elapsed, Dean called the fight. The bout was officially ruled a no-contest, and not a disqualification, despite the fight being ended by a disallowed move on Rodriguez\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been five minutes. It\u2019s done. If he can\u2019t open his eye,\u201d Dean could be heard telling the doctor, at the time.\n\n\u201cTime to call it.\u201d\n\nYair Rodriguez apologized to fans after poking Jeremy Stephens in the eye, Saturday, and the fight ending in a no-contest after just 15 seconds.

As Stephens was walked off of the floor, still partially blinded after being fouled, members of the crowd continued to hurl trash at him.\n\nStory continues\n\nRodriguez, who Stephens had taunted as an unmanly fighter leading up to the bout, was livid as well. Eventually, he calmed himself in time for a post-fight interview.\n\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Jeremy\u2019s fault, either. I\u2019ve got to give him the benefit of the doubt ... I worked hard, very hard for this fight.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can do is ask for your forgiveness and promise to be back, hard, and soon. Jeremy, I\u2019m sorry. It wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Despite lots of drama and uncertainty after the last blow was thrown Saturday in Mexico City, the UFC main event contest between Yair Rodriguez and Jeremy Stephens was technically over just 15 seconds after it began.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WhYYTzl8Gw5Kaxw4e.BbtA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjUuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ywtu3tZa2In50kUCxNVLEQ--~B/aD0yNTkxO3c9MzU4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b5ac0850-dce6-11e9-84e8-60adc9630007", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
