As our nation grapples with the horror of gender-based violence, a new wave of xenophobic attacks has washed over South Africa. Lives have been lost and property damaged. There has been looting and burning and violence.\"\n\nHe said he went to Johannesburg on Sunday to speak to his fellow South Africans, \"not to take sides, but to quell the tensions with the voice of truth\".\n\n\"I stated very clearly that I was there, not as a politician, but as an elder. I was there for the sake of my country.\"\n\nHe said the night before the meeting, bottle stores were looted and \"several angry township and hostel residents arrived still inebriated\".\n\n\"They were in no mood to hear a message of peace or to be reminded of our Constitution.\"\n\nAccording to Buthelezi, he informed Cele that he will be going, and Cele offered to arrange security.\n\n\"So I am dumb-struck by the minister's comment yesterday that he is 'taken aback' by my visit to Johannesburg, as though what I did was political posturing,\" Buthelezi said.\n\n\"The insinuation is there that, had I not gone to Johannesburg, the looting and violence that took place on Sunday would not have happened.\"\n\nButhelezi said he wasn't there to score political points.\n\n\"I am too old for political games,\" Buthelezi said.\n\n\"I have been vilified for too long to speak diplomatically. I am sick of the IFP being cast as responsible for violence, either obliquely or directly.\"\n\nCele closed the debate.\n\nHe said Sunday's meeting was originally planned as a government meeting and he liaised with indunas at the hostel, but after he received a complaint from King Goodwill Zwelithini that he wasn't consulted, but only indunas, he cancelled the meeting.\n\n\"It's not that I'm looking down on you,\" Cele said to Buthelezi.", "description": "Veteran IFP MP Mangosuthu Buthelezi used a debate on the wave of violence to defend himself and his party against Police Minister Bheki Cele's criticism that they contributed to Sunday's violence in Johannesburg.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8747/e36f22535ac8474fa7e167c627691bf9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
