None of the things that reporters and other commentators warned about \u2014 the glorification of violence, the emboldening of the mentally unstable and the embittered, etc. \u2014 are in the actual movie released by Warner Bros.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d is dark. It is difficult to watch. It is about loneliness and isolation. It is also about the importance of access to mental health care.\n\nBut there are no political messages that could be construed as sympathetic to the right-wing, let alone the far-far-far-right-wing. There is a political message in the movie, but it is mostly a caricature of the anti-One Percent message of the Occupy Wall Street protests of 2011 \u2014 perhaps a dangerous, violent message in the wrong hands, but certainly nothing like what critics warned of in this movie.", "description": "", "authors": ["Becket Adams", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion The-Medias-Joker-Panic-Was-All-Ginned-Up-Nonsense"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
