Would be badly let down by Maguire later on. 6\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold The Liverpool right-back was tested by Kosovo\u2019s left side. Defended well but his crossing lacked its usual fizz. 6\n\nMichael Keane The latest to falter while trying to play out from the back. Made amends with an assist for Sterling. 4\n\nJadon Sancho the difference as blunders mar England\u2019s 5-3 win against Kosovo Read more\n\nHarry Maguire The Manchester United defender got himself into a tangle and conceded a penalty after tripping Muriqi. 4\n\nBen Chilwell The Leicester defender had an encouraging game. However his crossing could have been more accurate. 6\n\nDeclan Rice The 20-year-old kept Celina quiet, but his sloppy pass led to Berisha making it 5-2. 6\n\nJordan Henderson Tried to be adventurous with his passing. Unable to cut out Muriqi\u2019s cross for Berisha\u2019s second goal. 6\n\nRoss Barkley The Chelsea midfielder flattered to deceive despite winning a penalty. Selfish and wasteful in the final third. 5\n\nRaheem Sterling The forward\u2019s header settled England\u2019s nerves. Superb assists for Kane and Sancho. Oozed class and confidence. 9\n\nHarry Kane The captain used his supposedly weaker left foot to put England ahead. Had a tame penalty saved. 8\n\nJadon Sancho Preferred to Rashford, the youngster opened his England account with two close-range finishes. Forced Vojvoda\u2019s own goal. 8\n\nSubstitutes\n\nMason Mount N/A (83min), Rashford N/A (85min)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Maguire fouls Vedat Muriqi to gift Kosovo a penalty. Photograph: ITV\n\nKosovo\n\nArijanet Muric He will always cherish saving Kane\u2019s penalty. Received scant protection from a wheezing back four. 6\n\nMergim Vojvoda Tormented by Sterling, his night went from bad to worse when he scored at the wrong end. 2\n\nAmir Rrahmani The captain lost out to Keane for England\u2019s equaliser, was embarrassed by Sterling and conceded a penalty. Booked. 4\n\nFidan Aliti The centre-back fumed after Vojvoda\u2019s own goal. He wanted play to stop after colliding with Alexander-Arnold. Booked. 4\n\nFlorent Hadergjonaj The Huddersfield defender was quick to attack early on but he soon had his hands full with Sancho\u2019s raids. 4\n\nIdriz Voca The midfielder struggled to contain England\u2019s fast attacks and was substituted early in the second half. 5\n\nEngland 5-3 Kosovo: Euro 2020 qualifier \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nBesar Halimi Always wanted the ball and used it well at times. Worked hard. A decent performance. 6\n\nFlorent Muslija Should have given the flailing Vojvoda more protection on the right. Substituted at half-time. 5\n\nBersant Celina The Swansea attacker found it hard to escape Rice. Unlucky to see a late effort curl just wide. 5\n\nValon Berisha Two fine finishes from the Lazio winger gave Kosovo something to remember and exposed frailties in England\u2019s defence. Booked. 7\n\nVedat Muriqi The burly striker had a good game. Created both of Berisha\u2019s goals before winning and converting a penalty. 7.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nLeart Paqarada Introduced at half-time. Booked for protesting too much about England\u2019s penalty. 6\n\nAnel Rashkaj Helped to restore order after replacing Voca in the 59th minute. Booked. 6\n\nFlorent Hasani N/A (85min)", "description": "Raheem Sterling and Valon Berisha showed their class while errors by Michael Keane and Harry Maguire led to goals", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62fe562230c750876454646adda91f15d8dbf75c/0_212_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=40b8acc5d549611400a08f638c2f2960", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
