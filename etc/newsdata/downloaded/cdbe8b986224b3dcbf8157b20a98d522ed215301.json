The companies cannot be named until they are officially informed of the auction results.\n\nTwenty-two companies will commercialise electricity from these projects, the government said, adding that these contracts will contribute to solar, wind and biomass energy generation capacity of 2,200 megawatts by 2022.\n\nPresident Ivan Duque's office said in a separate statement that the contracts would bring in investment of about $2.2bn, close to 7.5 trillion Colombian pesos.\n\nAn initial auction for renewables contracts closed without any results in February after the government said the projects would have ended up in the hands of too few applicants because many bidders fell short of requirements.\n\nA collective Latin American target of 70 percent renewable energy use by 2030 is meant to put Colombia and eight other countries in leadership roles in the run-up to December's United Nations climate change summit in Chile, Suarez has said.", "description": "Infrastructure constraints have hindered Colombia from fully developing renewable energy despite ideal conditions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/e22aab2f3a85444a9454dce1827b9c22_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
