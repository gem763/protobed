Bond & Sons, Ltd., an innovative and future-focused provider of some of the most technologically-advanced farming and agriculture machinery in the world, is announcing that it has completed a company-wide brand update with the support of Goat Creative Inc. (\u201cGoat\u201d), a Vancouver design agency.\n\n\u201cAs JBS has grown, our vision for the company has become clearer, and it was important to us that this new clarity is reflected in what we communicate to the world. Our team puts a significant amount of attention on the build quality and design of our machines, but we\u2019ve never placed that same kind of attention on our own brand or marketing. The time has come for us to show the world who we are.\u201d said Justin Bond, President of JBS.\n\nThe rebranding process was far-reaching and involved the entire JBS team, with the goal of first identifying and then communicating the most important values of the company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always believed in building innovative agricultural equipment for an evolving world, but one thing that has remained consistent is our values,\u201d added Bond. \u201cThis investment will not only help us to communicate those core values but will also help us better support our dealers across the world by giving them the tools they need to better showcase what we can deliver.\u201d\n\nTerence Sawtell, Founder & Strategy Director of Goat said: \u201cIt was important to us to understand what truly makes JBS unique and sought out by their customers, and our research showed that they are really loved by their customers. It is an absolute pleasure for us to work with clients like JBS that produce the best products in their industry. We are very proud of their new visual identity, defined place in the market, and core company values.\u201d\n\nLearn more about JBS, what it stands for and where it\u2019s going: JBSequipment.com/future\n\nAbout JBS Equipment\n\nJBS Equipment (\u201cJBS\u201d), (formerly J.
