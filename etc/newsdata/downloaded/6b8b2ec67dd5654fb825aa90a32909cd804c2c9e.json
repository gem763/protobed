We must bring this process to a conclusion.\"\n\nJohnson nonetheless said he remained \"confident\" of completing the ratification process by October 31.\n\nA third cover letter written by Britain's EU ambassador Tim Barrow made clear that the Brexit delay request letter was only being sent to comply with the law.\n\n- Tusk consults EU chiefs -\n\n\"I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react,\" Tusk said on Twitter.\n\nAn EU source told AFP that the process \"may take a few days\" and declined to comment on the non-signature.\n\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said the prime minister had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Tusk.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he had discussed the situation with Johnson and \"wished him success in the next stages\" in the Commons.\n\nBeing forced to send the letter after Saturday's defeat was a blow to Johnson, who has previously said he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than prolong the tortuous process of ending Britain's 46-year-old membership of the EU.\n\nBrussels urged Britain to explain its plan as soon as possible, while Macron's office said a new delay to Brexit was \"in nobody's interest\".\n\n- Johnson beaten 322-306 -\n\nSecuring the new divorce treaty at Thursday's EU summit had been a personal victory for the prime minister, a figurehead in the Leave campaign in Britain's 2016 EU membership referendum.\n\nHe had spent 48 hours frantically trying to persuade MPs to back it, and won support from many of the eurosceptic Conservatives who had three times rejected a previous divorce agreement secured by his predecessor Theresa May.\n\nBut parliament -- like the frustrated public -- is still bitterly divided over how and even whether Britain should end decades of integration with its closest trading partner.\n\nMPs voted by 322 to 306 to back a motion by former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin that \"withholds approval (of the deal) unless and until implementing legislation is passed\".\n\nThey were meeting on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War.\n\nWhile MPs voted inside parliament, outside, more than 100,000 people marched to demand a new referendum that could reverse Brexit.\n\nDemonstrators erupted into cheers at the news from inside the Commons.\n\n\"That's really good, that's one step away from Brexit,\" demonstrator Philip Dobson told AFP.\n\n\"Reject Brexit\", \"Put It To The People\" and \"Stop This Madness\" read some of the placards at the mass march, where many protesters also waved EU flags.\n\n- Legislation next week -\n\nThe British government will introduce legislation next week to implement the divorce deal, with a first vote as soon as Tuesday.\n\nThe government also wants another vote on the deal on Monday, which may not be possible.\n\nThere is a chance the deal could pass, and Britain could still leave the EU on October 31, but there remains strong opposition to the agreement among MPs.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reluctantly wrote to Brussels late Saturday asking for a Brexit extension after MPs voted to force him into seeking a delay beyond October 31.
