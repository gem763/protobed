The union leader sent a short message to colleagues saying he believed he was being kidnapped before all communications ceased.\n\nMagombeyi, who is leading a nationwide doctors\u2019 strike to force President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s government to raise wages for medical staff, had previously received warnings, which he believed came from security services, to stop his activism.\n\nThe exact circumstances of his release are unclear, with Magombeyi unable to give interviewers coherent details of what happened to him. He was found in Nyabira, about 18 miles (30km) from the capital, Harare.\n\nInterviewed by a reporter from Voice of America, Magombeyi sounded confused. He said he had no obvious physical injuries, but some pain. He told VOA he remembered \u201cbeing in a basement of some sort, being electrocuted at some point\u201d.\n\nHundreds of Zimbabwean doctors protested in central Harare during the week over the disappearance of Magombeyi. The ZHDA represents mainly junior doctors at public hospitals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Peter Magombeyi pictured during an interview earlier this month before the apparent abduction.

The health sector faces a severe lack of medicine and funds.\n\nDozens of pro-democracy campaigners, trade unionists and opposition officials have been abducted by suspected state security services since contested elections last year. Most have been released after several hours, though many have been badly beaten, stripped, threatened or otherwise mistreated.\n\nGovernment ministers and senior officials have suggested the apparent abduction of Magombeyi had been carried out by a \u201cthird force\u201d to destabilise the country.\n\nNick Mangwana, the information secretary, described Magombeyi as a \u201cliar\u201d after his release.\n\nAllegations that unidentified third parties were undermining authorities were a staple under Robert Mugabe, the previous president, who died this month in a clinic in Singapore.\n\nMugabe ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced to resign after a military takeover in November 2017. He was succeeded by Mnangagwa, who promised to bring foreign investment to avert a deepening economic crisis, reform government and rehabilitate the former British colony\u2019s international image.\n\nZimbabwe is crippled by massive debts incurred during Mugabe\u2019s rule and needs a multibillion-dollar bailout to prevent economic collapse. However, continuing repression and a lack of tangible political reform means there is little chance of international institutions offering major aid packages.", "description": "Peter Magombeyi, who was overseeing a doctors\u2019 strike, turns up confused and in pain", "authors": ["Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a45e0a040891a4b0eed218cc9a4f4208ab874898/173_321_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0492da32546ff7b73c1b3b692a6b80ba", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
