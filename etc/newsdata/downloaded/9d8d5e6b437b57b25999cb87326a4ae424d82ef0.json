Bobby Rush (D-IL), who chairs the Illinois Kamala Harris campaign, gave her opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) some advice this week. According to Rush, it would be \u201cegotistical\u201d and \u201cself-centered\u201d for Sanders to continue campaigning for president after his heart attack.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so egotistical, so self-centered, that you want to put the American people and your family into that position where day by day they don\u2019t know whether you are going to have another heart attack,\" Rush said on Tuesday to the Chicago Sun-Times Editorial Board. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that. The demands, the rigors of campaigning, the rigors of that office is too great, too important.\u201d\n\nSen. Sanders suffered a heart attack over a week ago and was rushed to surgery to have two stents inserted into his artery. Now recovering from the procedure, the 78-year-old told press this week that he'd be scaling back his campaign, having a few less events and rallies each day. His campaign also canceled an Iowa ad buy. That didn't sound very reassuring to his supporters, so on Thursday Sanders clarified that he's \"getting stronger everyday.\"\n\nYet, Rep. Rush told the media that he's certainly not saying Sanders should drop out. But...\n\n\"No, I would not say that,\" Rush said. \"I am just saying that it is pretty arrogant, self-centered and, to me, unsound...for the American people to elect him president.\u201d\n\nSanders is still one of the top three Democratic presidential contenders. The top two being former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who recently overtook Biden by a narrow margin in the RealClearPolitics average. She's surging, so naturally some more skeletons are emerging. But Warren may not have to worry because she's become the media favorite.", "description": ".10/10/2019 20:17:31PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/f8755bb0-7e3d-4f32-8128-647478840f61.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
