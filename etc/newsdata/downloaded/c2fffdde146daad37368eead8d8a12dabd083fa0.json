A whole ten boxes worth of dimes (similar to 10p coins), weighing 350 pounds. As you do.\n\nTaking to Facebook to explain her move, she wrote: \u2018So a man that I was married to, bless his heart, decided to do me the biggest favor of my life and slept with his own FRIEND\u2019S wife.\n\n\u2018The woman who attended my WEDDING and watched me hold hands and look into the eyes of the man I loved and promise him my forever all while knowing damn well they were sleeping together!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Well I busted em and that led us into divorce court, and for some god awful reason, I was ordered to pay HIM $7,500.\n\n\u2018It is what it is and now I have to pay him. Court\u2019s order. So I\u2019m paying him! The court order, and I quote says I have to pay him \u201cthe sum of $7500\u201d That\u2019s it.

His loss.\u2019\n\n\u2018I would have loved to see his facial expression,\u2019 chimed another. And honestly, same.\n\nBrandi is so chuffed with the outcome of the situation, she even bought a slogan t-shirt with the words \u2018Divorced AF\u2019.\n\nMORE: Woman only has sex with her husband once a year because of painful condition\n\nMORE: Woman writes glorious Gumtree advert for gift from her cheating ex-husband\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "When American mum Brandi Lee went to divorce her husband, who she claims cheated on her, she didn't expect to pay him.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93238361_1572267831.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
