Guards, dressed in black uniforms, can be seen keeping watch.\n\n\u201cChilling footage of blindfolded and bound men hardly makes the mass detention of Muslim [mostly Uighur] seem like the benign \u201cvocational training\u201d that China, against all the facts, pretends it is,\u201d Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said on Twitter.\n\nThe footage appears to have been filmed from an overhead drone.\n\nNathan Ruser, a researcher with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s International Cyber Policy Centre, said on Twitter that he believed the video was genuine.\n\nMr Ruser added that he thought the clip had been filmed in August 2018.\n\nHis comments on Twitter spread quickly online, prompting a response from Marise Payne, Australia\u2019s foreign minister.\n\n\u201cI am aware of the deeply disturbing video that has been published online,\u201d she said, according to news.com.au.\n\n\u201cI have previously raised Australia\u2019s concerns about reports of mass detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim peoples in Xinjiang.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This explanation has been repeatedly dismissed by the UN and human rights experts.\n\nMike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said Beijing\u2019s detention of Muslims had nothing to do with terrorism, but was an attempt \u201cto erase\u201d minority cultures and religions.\n\n\u201cI want to make clear that China\u2019s repressive campaign in Xinjiang is not about terrorism,\u201d he said after a meeting in New York on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about China\u2019s attempt to erase its own citizens.\u201d\n\nBeijing has attempted to pressure countries to which Uighur people have fled, to send them back to China, but Mr Pompeo urged such nations to resist.\n\n\u201cWe call on all countries to resist China\u2019s demands to repatriate the Uighurs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the Chinese embassy in London for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Footage which appears to show blindfolded and shackled Muslim\u00a0prisoners held in Xinjiang, China, has prompted widespread condemnation\u00a0after it was posted anonymously online.
