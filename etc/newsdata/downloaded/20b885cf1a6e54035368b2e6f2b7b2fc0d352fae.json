Multiple #Emmy Award-winner @JeffDaniels will star as former FBI Director James Comey in a new four-hour #CBSTVStudios event miniseries based on Comey's @NYTimes #1 bestselling book, 'A Higher Loyalty.' pic.twitter.com/EpVdl9Yd0o \u2014 CBS TV Studios (@CBSTVStudios) October 7, 2019\n\nDaniels \u2014 who has been vocally anti-Trump for years and has even advocated for physical violence against the president \u2014 is expected to start filming his new role in November. There\u2019s no word yet on when the miniseries will air, or on which CBS property, potentially Showtime or CBS All Access.\n\nBilly Ray, who wrote Captain Phillips and the upcoming Clint Eastwood film Richard Jewell, is penning and directing the project.\n\nRay told Deadline in a statement: \u201cJeff is so perfect for this part. Great actor, instant integrity, loads of warmth, intelligence, complexity and gravitas\u2026 We talked backstage after I saw him in To Kill a Mockingbird on Broadway, and I knew I was looking at the only person who could play Jim Comey. Lucky for me, he said yes.\u201d\n\nDaniels is set to conclude his Broadway run in To Kill a Mockingbird on Nov. 3. The actor has publicly railed against President Donald Trump numerous times in TV interviews and on his Twitter account.\n\nHe once told MSNBC that Trump has \u201csoiled the presidency.\u201d\n\nActor @Jeff_Daniels: \u201cThe fact that this guy, this president has completely soiled the Oval Office. Soiled the presidency. And you\u2019ve got a lot of people \u2014 and I keep looking at them. I go, \u2018when is enough enough?\u2019\u201d #LastWord pic.twitter.com/LmL5LrENNz \u2014 NewsBusters (@newsbusters) May 31, 2019\n\nThe star appeared earlier this year on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and said that Trump\u2019s challenger needs to be somebody who can \u201cpunch him in the face.\u201d\n\nComey served as the head of the FBI from 2013 to 2017, when he was fired by President Donald Trump. It was later revealed that Comey violated bureau policy by leaking several memos with classified information to an associate with instructions to pass the information to a reporter.\n\nAttorney General William Barr decided in August not prosecute the fired FBI director over his wrongdoings.\n\nIn recent days, Comey has publicly advocated for impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\n\u201cSome media are quoting me from last week about my hope that America will remove Donald Trump by an election, not Impeachment. But we may now be at the point where members of the House and Senate can\u2019t uphold their own oaths to support and defend the Constitution without acting,\u201d Comey said last month.\n\nSome media are quoting me from last week about my hope that America will remove Donald Trump by an election, not Impeachment.
