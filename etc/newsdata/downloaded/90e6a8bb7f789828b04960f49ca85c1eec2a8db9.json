Is it not impeachment?\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, led by Representative Jerry Nadler of New York, has already been calling hearings and shooting off lawsuits in what has seemed very much like an impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut as Quinta Jurecic argues, all this unclear language may have dulled \u201cthe moral clarity in defense of the rule of law that impeachment proceedings might otherwise have offered.\u201d\n\nApr\u00e8s Call, le D\u00e9luge\n\nThe Ukraine call scandal gives Democrats a new jawdropping incident to latch on to. But as my colleague David A. Graham writes: \u201cThe rhetorical stakes of that comment are high; the material stakes are not so clear.\u201d\n\nEven as the count of lawmakers calling for impeachment before today had steadily creeped upward towards 200, they\u2019ve disagreed on the exact wrongdoing to examine.\n\nWhen Elaine Godfrey and Russell Berman surveyed more than a dozen pro-impeachment lawmakers earlier this month on what they considered Trump\u2019s most impeachable offense, the answers they got were all over the place.\n\n\u201cSelf-enrichment,\u201d said one. \u201cBromance with Vladimir Putin,\u201d said another.\n\nNow that Democrats are moving full-steam ahead on impeachment, how exactly does the process work?\n\nRead Yoni Appelbaum\u2019s authoritative history of the process and why it exists in the first place, here.\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai\n\nSnapshot\n\n(Jason DeCrow / AP)\n\nSupporters of a regime change in Iran rally outside the United Nations headquarters in New York on the first day of the general debate at the U.N.
