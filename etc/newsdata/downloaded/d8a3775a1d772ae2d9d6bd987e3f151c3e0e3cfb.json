The first informal meeting between Xi and Modi, held last year in Central China's Wuhan, Hubei province, offered both leaders an opportunity to compare notes about bilateral relations and global trends and phenomena.\n\nBeijing believes personal ties built through such level of face-to-face communication are conducive to building trust.\n\nDespite their historical disputes over some sections of their boundaries, which sparked the Doklam standoff in August 2017, Beijing and New Delhi have by and large done a good job preventing such issues from marring the \"big picture\" of bilateral relations. Their Wuhan meeting was praised by Chinese media as representing a \"new starting point for opening up stable China-India relations\".\n\nWhile it remains to be seen what Xi and Modi can accomplish in Chennai, the potential of greater bilateral engagement certainly supports a relationship that is far more positive than one that is just stable.", "description": "From Friday to Sunday, Chinese President Xi Jinping will have an \"informal meeting\" with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pay a state visit to Nepal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9dcd77a310cf3e97a05774.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
