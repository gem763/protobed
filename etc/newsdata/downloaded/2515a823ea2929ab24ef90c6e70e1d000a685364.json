I left a lot of my approach shots below the hole and was able to be pretty aggressive.\u201d", "description": "Silence was golden for Tiger Woods as he carded a second straight six-under-par 64 to grab a two-shot second-round lead over Jeff Woodland at the Zozo Championship on Saturday.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "James Corrigan"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
