Then I waved in front of her face.\n\n\"The car hit the barrier and was shaking as we were scraping it. Then when mum completely passed out I got the steering wheel and went across the lanes onto the grass. I was 10 out of 10 scared.\"\n\n(Image: Surrey Live / Darren Pepe)\n\nLauren was unconscious for around half an hour in total and can only remember the moments before the seizure, but has been able to piece together what happened with the help of Ben, witnesses and paramedics.\n\nThe mum, who now lives in Deepcut, Surrey with her son, added: \"Where I worked at a primary school at the time, Ben went to the same school.\n\n\"It was about a 30-minute drive from Colchester to the school in Harwich. We were just driving home from school one day, we were about 20 minutes into the journey, so we were really close to home, and then I suddenly had a seizure.\n\n(Image: Surrey Live / Darren Pepe)\n\n\"Sometimes they can't explain it and it will suddenly happen for no reason, or for stress or if you're on certain types of medication sometimes even if you just have a cold, your body doesn't handle it as well as it normally does and your body can't cope with it. It was just a freak one-off.\n\n\"I didn't feel like I had a seizure, either, I just felt like I had blinked for a split-second. It was really weird. It was really scary.\"\n\n\"We were in the slow lane on a busy A-road, but we were still able to go 60mph. I remember going 60mph and seeing a sign that our turning was two miles away.\n\n\"When I woke up, we were right on the bit where we turn off, so the whole thing happened over two miles.\"\n\n(Image: Surrey Live / Darren Pepe)\n\nBen, now nine, was given the Child of Courage Award at the Pride of Britain event on Monday.\n\nOnly two weeks earlier, he won a Young Hero award at the Amplifon Awards for Brave Britons 2019, which recognise the Best of British.\n\nSpeaking about his heroic actions, Lauren added: \"We were scraping along the central barrier for a while, then two guys that were behind us drove parallel to us to see what was going on and look through the window.\n\n\"They said they could see me not in a fit state and Ben's little arms on the steering wheel, then realised something was really wrong.\n\n\"Ben was still weaving a little bit. He said he realised he needed to get off the road as the car wasn't slowing down. My foot was still on the accelerator as my body was so tense. He told me he thought he needed to get on the grass as there were no cars there.\n\n\"I woke up and tried to start the car because, to me, it felt like a split second, so I thought I was still driving. I was wondering why the car had stopped, we were driving just a minute ago, I hadn't taken in my surroundings by this point. I kept trying to fiddle for the key, realised it wasn't in the ignition and was fiddling around.\"\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThe heroic actions resulted in neither Ben or his mum suffering any injuries.\n\nAs well as steering, Ben knew to put the car's hazard lights on, something his mum believes he learned from playing driving games in arcades.\n\n\"The paramedics drilled it into me that it was because of what Ben did [that we didn't get hurt]. I specifically remember one of the paramedics saying they were adamant that it would have been a different story if he didn't do what he did.\"\n\nBen attended an event in London not knowing he was receiving a Pride of Britain Award. Ben was invited to play a Nintendo Switch game against someone else, who was sitting on the opposite side of a divide.\n\nFormer One Direction member Liam Payne craftily took over as Ben's opponent then surprised him when Ben came round to see who had beat him.\n\nLauren said: \"Ben turned around, looked at him and smiled, then after a couple of seconds he realised who it was and it was really funny.\n\n\"Liam told him he had won the award, got out a golden envelope and said 'The reason I am here is to say you have won a Pride of Britain Award'. Ben just burst out crying.\n\n\"He was so happy and overwhelmed. He had the shock of Liam Payne and now he had the shock of winning an award.\"\n\nThe 20th Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, was attended by celebrities and public figures including Prince Charles, Gareth Southgate, Ant and Dec, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick and Sir Michael Caine.", "description": "Ben Hedger, from Deepcut, Surrey, won at award at the Pride of Britain ceremony after mum Lauren Smith fell unconscious at the wheel", "authors": ["Jamie Phillips", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Surrey Live", "Darren Pepe", "Andy Stenning Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754686.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DPP_SAH_AN191080_005JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
