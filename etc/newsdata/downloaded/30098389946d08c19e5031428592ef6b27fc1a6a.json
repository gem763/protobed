However, sulphur is conspicuously absent. They are all part of a rock record that offers the most detailed look yet into the aftermath of the catastrophe which wiped out 75 per cent of life on Earth.\n\nSean Gulick, a research professor at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG), who worked with an international team of more than two dozen scientists, said the research \u201ctells us about impact processes from an eyewitness location\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an expanded record of events that we were able to recover from within ground zero,\u201d he said, describing it as a short-lived inferno at the regional level, followed by a long period of global cooling.\n\nThe asteroid \u201cfried them, then [it] froze them.

This suggests the charred landscape was deluged by the tsunami, then pulled into the crater as the floodwaters retreated.\n\nJay Melosh, a Purdue University professor and expert on impact cratering, said finding evidence for wildfire helps scientists know their understanding of the asteroid impact is on the right track.\n\n\u201cIt was a momentous day in the history of life, and this is a very clear documentation of what happened at ground zero,\u201d said Professor Melosh, who was not involved with this study.\n\nOne of the most important findings from the research is the lack of sulphur in the core samples. The area surrounding the impact crater is full of sulphur-rich rocks. But there was no sulphur in the core.\n\nThe discovery supports the theory the asteroid impact vaporised the sulphur-bearing minerals present at the impact site and released it into the atmosphere, where it wreaked havoc on the Earth\u2019s climate, reflecting sunlight away from the planet and causing global cooling.\n\nResearchers estimate at least 325 billion metric tons of sulphur would have been released by the impact. That\u2019s about four times the quantity spewed out during the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa \u2013 an event which cooled the Earth\u2019s climate by an average of 1C for five years.\n\nAlthough the asteroid impact created mass destruction at the regional level, it was this global climate change that caused the mass extinction, killing off the dinosaurs along with most other life on the planet at the time.\n\n\u201cThe real killer has got to be atmospheric,\u201d Professor Gulick said. \u201cThe only way you get a global mass extinction like this is an atmospheric effect.\u201d", "description": "Sixty-six million years ago, life on our planet was going on just as it had on any other day \u2013 enormous reptiles dominated the landscape.\u00a0Herbivorous behemoths up to 40 metres long co-mingled with bi-pedal carnivorous titans, seas teemed with fanged leviathans and the skies were navigated by leathery-winged creatures larger than any birds in history.
