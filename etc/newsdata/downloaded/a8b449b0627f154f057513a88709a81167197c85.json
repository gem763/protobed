Stocks, including giants such as Boeing BA, Caterpillar CAT, and 3M MMM, all fell as global economic slowdown fears start to impact the U.S. We also dive into why Allegiant Travel Company ALGT is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\nThe first official trading day of September saw all three major U.S. indexes fall. Tuesday\u2019s downturn came after a volatile August and followed the new round of tariffs that were imposed on Sunday. These new U.S. tariffs are set to impact more consumer-related goods, which could hurt retail spending in the vital holiday shopping period. For instance, J.P. Morgan JPM estimates the new consumer-facing tariffs will cost the average American household $1,000 a year.\n\nMeanwhile, retaliatory Chinese tariffs on everything from soybeans to crude oil also went into effect. Plus, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s purchasing managers index fell to 49.1 in August. Investors should note that anything below 50 signals contraction.\n\nOn top of that, the U.S. trucking industry has been hit by the broader economic slowdown. And the Wall Street Journal reported that economic confidence for small U.S. companies slipped to its lowest levels since 2012.\n\nMoving on, Wall Street might turn its attention to Slack WORK Wednesday afternoon. Shares of newly public work-based communication tech firm have fallen, in similar fashion to Uber UBER and Lyft LYFT and in contrast to Pinterest PINS and Beyond Meat BYND.\n\nThis episode of Free Lunch then closes with a look at why discount airline and travel company Allegiant Travel is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\nLegalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than Marijuana\n\n\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $150 billion in this industry every year\u2026 more than twice as much as they\n\nspend on marijuana.\n\n\n\nNow that 8 states have fully-legalized it (with several more states following close behind), Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand. One industry insider described the future as \u201cmind-blowing\u201d \u2013 and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge.\n\n\n\nSee these 5 \u201csin stocks\u201d now >>\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
