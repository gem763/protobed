The decision was made despite China\u2019s suppression of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and the internment of more than one million Uighur Muslims in the state of Xinjiang.\n\nNBA\u2019s travails in China a cautionary tale for the Premier League | Marina Hyde Read more\n\n\u201cThis is a historic decision for football because the Fifa council decided unanimously to appoint China as the host for the new Fifa World Cup for clubs,\u201d said Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, in announcing the decision.\n\n\u201cThe new Fifa World Cup for clubs will be a competition which every person who loves football looks forward to. It is the first real and true world cup for the best teams and clubs in the world.\u201d\n\nFifa was immediately criticised for the move, with Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of policy and government affairs, Allan Hogarth, saying: \u201cChina being chosen to host the Fifa Club World Cup in 2021 presents Beijing with yet another opportunity to try to \u2018sportswash\u2019 its tarnished international reputation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely the Chinese authorities will see the competition as an opportunity to project an image of openness and toleration, whereas the much darker reality in the country is one of pervasive censorship, relentless round-ups of dissidents, and the shocking mass detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cChina has an atrocious human rights record and Fifa must use its considerable influence to push for human rights improvements in the country.\n\n\u201cAny club involved in a China-hosted Club World Cup \u2013 from players through to coaches and backroom staff \u2013 should be ready to speak out on human rights issues in China.\u201d\n\nThe revamped cup came in for heavy criticism even before Thursday\u2019s announcement. The European Club Association, a body representing the continent\u2019s biggest clubs, has threatened to boycott the expanded even event. In a letter written to Uefa in March, 15 of the ECA\u2019s clubs wrote that they were \u201cfirmly against any approval of a revised Club World Cup at this point in time and confirm that no ECA clubs would take part to such a competition\u201d.\n\nThe tournament currently involves seven teams \u2013 with the Champions League winners Liverpool set to take part in this year\u2019s tournament in Qatar. Fifa is yet to decide the qualification criteria for the expanded 24-team version.", "description": "Human rights organisations have condemned Fifa\u2019s decision to stage a revamped version of the Club World Cup in China in 2021", "authors": ["Paul Macinnes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32f738c7b2d386398d3ecb578d2407c720490dd4/0_65_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aea1d5a182ee25f2def4bdf23f98c871", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
