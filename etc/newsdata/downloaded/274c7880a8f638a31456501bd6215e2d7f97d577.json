France's CAC 40 index\n\njumped 0.79% to hit a more than one-month high,\n\noutperforming major European bourses, aided by a 8% rise in\n\nshares of engine maker Safran after the company upped\n\nits full-year profit forecasts.\n\nThe rally followed gains in Asia, with MSCI's broadest index\n\nof Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gaining as\n\nmuch as 1.08% to reach its highest since Aug. 2.\n\nU.S. stock futures reversed early losses and rose\n\n0.5%.\n\nThe Chinese yuan jumped versus the dollar in offshore trade,\n\nwhile safe-haven assets such as gold, the Swiss franc, and the\n\nyen fell.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said on Thursday its trade team\n\nwould consult with their U.S. counterparts in mid-September in\n\npreparation for negotiations in early October, hinting at\n\nprogress in reducing trade friction. Both sides agreed to take actual actions to create\n\nfavourable conditions, the ministry added, without giving more\n\ndetails.\n\n\"The general market tone is driven by the announcement of\n\nthe meeting of high-ranking officials between China and the\n\nU.S,\" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss\n\nwealth manager Prime Partners.\n\n\"But this is not a sustained move into risk-on mode as\n\nnothing concrete has come out of it yet and investors need to\n\nwait to see whether the meeting will happen and what the results\n\nfrom it will be.\"\n\nBREXIT NEWS ALSO A POSITIVE\n\nAdding to the upbeat mood, a parliamentary vote in Britain\n\nput the brakes on the nation's no-deal exit from the European\n\nUnion, Hong Kong withdrew a contentious extradition bill that\n\nsparked recent protests in the Chinese-ruled city and weeks of\n\npolitical turmoil in Italy appeared to ease.\n\n\"Since yesterday, there has been limited downside in markets\n\nbecause of what happened in Hong Kong, but now the U.S.-China\n\ntalks are the story,\" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro\n\nstrategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co in Tokyo.\n\n\"It's the same about Brexit, which means less downside\n\nrisk.\"\n\nAny sign that Washington and Beijing are closer to scaling\n\nback or resolving their trade dispute would lift a significant\n\nburden from the global economy, but many analysts believe the\n\ntwo sides are dug in for a longer and costlier battle.\n\nWeighing on sentiment was data that showed German industrial\n\norders fell more than expected in July on poor demand from\n\nabroad, indicating manufacturers in Europe's biggest economy\n\ncontinue to struggle in the third quarter. In European stocks, Dassault Aviation joined\n\nSafran in a sharp rise thanks to upbeat earnings updates.\n\nDassault rose 9%. News of a $5 billion share buyback sent\n\nEquinor up 5.8%.\n\nUK bank CYBG slumped 19% after saying it expected\n\nto increase its provision for legacy payment protection\n\ninsurance by to 450 million pounds ($552 million).\n\nIn currency markets, the British pound lost some of its\n\novernight gains on concern that an election is still pending,\n\nalthough Britain might have averted leaving the European Union\n\nnext month without a transition deal. Lawmakers are hoping to pass a bill that seeks to stop\n\nBritain from leaving the European Union on Oct. 31 with no\n\nagreement. Against the dollar GBP=D3 , the pound fell 0.3% to $1.2211,\n\nafter jumping 1.4% on Wednesday.\n\nAgainst the offshore yuan CNH=D3 , the dollar fell as much\n\nas 0.2% to 7.1340 yuan.\n\nSpot gold fell 0.6% to $1542.38 per ounce.\n\nThe dollar rose 0.17% to 106.60 yen JPY=EBS and gained 0.3% to\n\n0.9839 Swiss franc CHF=EBS .\n\nThe 10-year German Bund rose more than 1 basis\n\npoint to -0.66%, away from the record lows of -0.743% touched on\n\nTuesday.\n\nSeizing on recent doubts about whether a European Central\n\nBank stimulus package next week can match expectations, other\n\ntop-rated euro zone yields also increased ,\n\n, although the rises were small.\n\nHaving spiralled lower in the past week after agreement was\n\nreached on a new coalition government in Rome, Italian yields\n\nsteadied near their record lows.\n\nThe 10-year Italian yield was unchanged at 0.826%\n\n, close to the record low of 0.803%.
