QBE has taken an increasingly hard line on climate change, and earlier this year announced it would no longer underwrite or invest in thermal coal operations.\n\nQBE declined to comment on whether its decision to leave the BCA had anything to do with their lobbying on climate change.\n\nNAB and ANZ pressured to quit BCA\n\nLate last week, the ACCR lodged shareholder resolutions with NAB and ANZ calling on the two banks to suspend their membership of the BCA over its position on climate change. Neither resolution is expected to succeed.\n\nThe ACCR lodged a similar resolution with BHP, which 22 per cent of shareholders voted in favour of at the company's British annual general meeting last Thursday. Shareholders of the Australian arm of the dual-listed company will vote on the same resolution in Melbourne on November 7.\n\nACCR spokesman Daniel Gocher said while the BHP resolution focused on a number of lobby groups, including the Minerals Council, the ANZ and NAB resolutions focus exclusively on the BCA.\n\nHe said the BCA's support of the use of Kyoto carryover credits, which allow the government to subtracts its overachievement on the Kyoto protocol targets from its Paris targets, was the most serious issues. But the resolution cites a number of others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese include its support in investing in existing coal-fired power stations to keep them open, its position that a 45 per cent emissions reduction target would be \u201ceconomy wrecking\", its support for lifting moratoria on natural gas exploration, and its proposal for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to be allowed to consider investment in thermal generation with carbon capture and storage.\n\n\u201cBoth ANZ and NAB are members of the BCA, whose record on climate policy advocacy is one of paying lip service to the Paris Agreement while doing everything it possibly can to block effective measures to reduce emissions,\" he said.\n\n\"ANZ, NAB and their shareholders have an interest in policy to rapidly reduce emissions across the Australian economy. The BCA\u2019s advocacy has been strongly counter to that goal.\"\n\nThe BCA declined to comment on either QBE's departure or the NAB and ANZ shareholder resolutions. But it has forcefully defended its position on climate change in the past, pointing out it supports the government's Paris emissions reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, albeit with Kyoto carryover credits.\n\nIt also supported the Turnbull government's abandoned national energy guarantee, and supports carbon pricing - although the ACCR says BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott's proposal of a carbon price of $10 per tonne falls far short of what is necessary, pointing to the International Monetary Fund's claim that even a carbon price of $US75 ($109) a tonne would be insufficient to hit the Paris goals.\n\nIn an interview with the ABC last month, BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott justified the use of Kyoto carryover credits on the grounds that \"you've got to reward early action\".\n\n\"And why wouldn't you try and reward early action taken by businesses. But these are things that are sorted out as part of the negotiations. It's a legitimate provision of the Paris Agreement and as we go forward, those sorts of provisions will be negotiated as countries renew and update the Paris obligations,\" she said.\n\nBoth banks said they would announce the board's recommendation on the resolution in their notices of AGM. ANZ's AGM will take place on December 17, and NAB's on December 18.\n\nBrynn O'Brien, executive director of the ACCR, admitted the resolutions were \"unlikely to succeed\". \"However we think that this is the first step in shining a light on how even the most climate aware organisations in Australia are still funding lobbying counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement and their own interests,\" she said.\n\nACCR is funded by donations. Its biggest funders last year were the Australian Communities Foundation, the Graeme Wood Foundation, Howard Pender, LUCRF Super, the McKinnon Family Foundation, and Sunrise.", "description": "General insurer QBE has dropped its membership of the Business Council of Australia, in another blow for the under-fire lobbying group.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.3101%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d97f62cbafeffb05c1ab7c9b194f320c28fe3fc7", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
