On the other hand you have Donald Trump, a populist obsessed with forcing China to buy more goods \u2013 a market distorting demand.\n\nThis inconsistency has seriously hurt negotiations, and contributed to putting China in a position where it cannot simply lose to Donald Trump. Under these conditions a stalemate is the best we hope for.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThe markets have been a whipsaw, the US economy has slowed down, and one report suggests that US companies may have shed 10,488 jobs because of the trade war between the US and China \u2013 a trade war that has worsened over the last few weeks.\n\nSo the two sides have laid down their arms and agreed to a ceasefire in hopes of \u201ccreating the conditions\u201d that will make it possible for discussions to resume in October.\n\nUnfortunately those talks, should they ever occur, will achieve little aside from temporarily calming financial markets. Donald Trump\u2019s trade war is a trade war that cannot be won.\n\nThe reality is that from the start the objectives of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war have been at odds with one another, making it impossible for his administration to construct a deal that one might consider a win for US markets.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, throughout this process, Trump\u2019s conflicting demands and brutish tactics have put Chinese President Xi Jinping in a position where he and his administration cannot concede.\n\nSo we had better hope this ceasefire lasts beyond Trump\u2019s next tweet storm, because it\u2019s about as good as things are going to get.\n\nWhy Trump can\u2019t win\n\nBefore we get into any of this, let\u2019s remember that China has three demands that the US must meet in order to end the trade war.\n\nThat the US respect China\u2019s national sovereignty. That the US remove all tariffs it has imposed since the beginning of the trade war. That the US cease demanding that China buy an unrealistic amount of goods from the US.\n\nRemember number 3, because it\u2019s the one that\u2019s really messing things up here. And of course it\u2019s the one Donald Trump is obsessed with.\n\nIt is easy to forget that initially this trade war was about making China\u2019s markets more fair for US businesses \u2013 ending favoritism for domestic companies, forced technology transfers, and intellectual property theft. Back in March 2018 the United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer wrote a report to Congress outlining all these issues and all the ways China was in violation of World Trade Organization rules. It all made sense.\n\nBut at the same time there was Donald Trump and his obsession with trade deficits \u2013 with getting China to buy more US stuff. This did not, and still does not, make any sense. In sophisticated economies bilateral trade deficits don\u2019t mean anything.\n\nLighthizer wants changes that will make China a more free market economy like the US. Trump wants changes that further distort the Chinese economy by explicitly forcing it to buy goods from one place rather than another. The former is capitalism, the latter is Trump\u2019s variety of populist nationalism. And they do not play well together.\n\n\u201cThere are various ways in the short run to reduce the bilateral trade deficit but this would be done in ways that are essentially market distorting,\u201d Carnegie Mellon University economist Lee Branstetter told Business Insider.\n\nThese two conflicting goals have repeatedly caused issues during the on-again-off-again negotiations. Think back to December: Trump ratcheted up the tariffs, China managed to negotiate a temporary peace by promising to buy US soybeans, negotiations resumed, and then collapsed as China refused to yield to the US\u2019s conflicting demands\n\n\u201cBefore Trump [making a trade deal with China] was always about setting the rules and structures and accepting the market outcomes,\u201d Branstetter continued.\n\nNow it\u2019s about sales.\n\nAnd on the other hand, if Lighthizer\u2019s objectives \u2013 changing their rules to open up China for US companies \u2013 are met it\u2019s likely Donald Trump\u2019s core nationalist objectives \u2013 forcing companies to move to the US \u2013 will suffer.\n\n\u201cIf China were to fix those problems, the result would be that the Chinese market would become more hospitable for American and other western companies to set up production within China,\u201d economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute told Business Insider via email.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a fundamental inconsistency between achieving that outcome, and the Trump administration\u2019s other economic nationalist priorities, which focuses on bringing manufacturing production back to the United States, even if that comes at the expense of everything else, including American farmers.\u201d\n\nWhy Xi can\u2019t lose\n\nMaking matters more complicated, on the other side of this deal we have Chinese President Xi Jinping, a man who cannot lose. There are political reasons for that, and there are practical reasons. On the latter point we need to return to Donald Trump\u2019s obsession with China buying more US goods.\n\nEven if China could buy enough US goods to close its trade deficit, according to Citigroup analysts, the US doesn\u2019t have enough to sell to China without disrupting trade with its partners or changing US production.\n\nFrom Citigroup:\n\n\u201cThe US likely can increase supplies of soy products to China in the short run, as well as select meats. However, meeting the proposed $1.2 trillion of additional shipments of goods to China over six years, including energy, machinery and tech products, will require major adjustments in the US and China\u2019s current trading partners, as well as a reconfiguration of US domestic production of these items.\u201d\n\nAnd Citigroup\u2019s researchers also found that when it comes to foods, motor vehicles, semiconductors, and aerospace, the US is at or near full-production-capacity-utilization rates. We can\u2019t make anymore. When it comes to energy and poultry, the US doesn\u2019t have enough to sell to meet China\u2019s demand.\n\nOf course, there are also political reasons why Xi cannot just cave to Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nSince talks collapsed in May Xi has adopted the language of struggle. He used the word around 60 times in a speech he gave last week. Using China\u2019s state controlled media he has cast the US as an aging power hell bent on stopping the country\u2019s rise. It is a position he and the Chinese Communist Party are very comfortable being in. It allows the party to blame its economic problems on the US, and it raises nationalist sentiment to a fever pitch that makes it impossible for Xi to lose face and back down.\n\nSo, what\u2019s this deal supposed to look like? What does a win even look like to Donald Trump? For some China watchers it simply does not exist.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no deal to make,\u201d Anne Stevenson-Yang, founder of China focused investment firm J Capital Markets told Business Insider. \u201cEveryone is going through a pantomime for the markets. It\u2019s super stupid that the markets believe it.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Over the last few months it's been easy to forget what the US wants from its trade war with China, and that's made it easy to forget why it can't win..
