She still doesn't understand when we speak that the sound she's hearing is coming from us, but she recognizes nature sounds.\n\n'I hope this video lets others know there is hope for you or your loved one to hear again.'", "description": "Q'ela Pierce, three, was left overwhelmed when her parents switched on her cochlear hearing implant for the first time since her surgery at Nemours Children's Hospital, Orlando.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/10/20124220-0-image-a-27_1571909404217.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
