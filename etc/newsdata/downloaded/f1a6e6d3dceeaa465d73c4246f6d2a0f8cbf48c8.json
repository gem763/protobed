Prehistoric rock art in northern Australia, for example, shows a warrior-like figure with a satchel over his arm. The 5,300-year-old mummy of Otzi the Ice Man, carried a backpack \u2013 and wore a pouch attached to a leather belt \u2013 on his journey through what are now called the Tyrolean Alps. Ancient Roman soldiers carried satchels made from leather or goat\u2019s hide that look almost exactly like the kind of messenger bag you might see in a shop today.\n\nIn some ways, these bags are a far cry from the expensive \u201cit\u201d bags you see being carried today. In other ways, they\u2019re not so different at all \u2013 each of those early bags will have been skilfully crafted by hand, an approach that still underpins many modern luxury handbags.\n\nOne of the main threads that runs through the history of handbags \u2013 and persists even in today\u2019s industrialised economy \u2013 is the power of craftsmanship. This belief in the value of a bag made by experts steeped in experience has held sway ever since handbags became more than a practical necessity. Today, the heart of this artisanal trade in handbags, as it has been for decades, is Italy.\n\nLooking over the colourful harbour of Palermo, Sicily, Studio Sarta is one of some 4,500 leather businesses in the country. Established in 2017 by siblings Giorgia and Fabio Gaeta, it is also one of the country\u2019s newer handbag companies. Much of the studio\u2019s approach is modern, too. Studio Sarta\u2019s handbags are chic and elegant, featuring clean lines and a contemporary aesthetic. Their business sense is equally up-to-date. Their Instagram account, which features striking shots of their products modelled against moody landscapes and industrial-chic interiors, is one main aspect of their marketing strategy.\n\nBut the foundation of that Sarta style is traditional Italian craftsmanship. Their creations use Vienna straw, a traditional material used in Sicilian bag-making, handwoven by local artisans in Palermo, as well as leather sourced from Tuscan tanneries.\n\n\u201cStudio Sarta was born from the idea of developing contemporary design objects both for the person and the house \u2013 not just bags \u2013 that use the know-how of our local artisans,\u201d says Giorgia. \u201cThe Italian tradition of tailoring and craftsmanship is one of the fundamental elements.\u201d\n\nIn fact, every step of the process \u2013 from design to prototype to production \u2013 is done by hand. At the Tuscan tannery, workers clean the raw hides, then tumble them in a giant tanning barrel with vegetable-based dyes \u2013 a process that can be as much as five times more time-consuming than industrial tanning, but which cuts out many chemicals and toxins.\n\n\u201cIt is hand-dried and buffed entirely by hand to obtain the characteristic aged effect,\u201d Giorgia says. \u201cThe \u2018vegetable tanning\u2019, which has origins in prehistory and in Tuscany is at its maximum splendour, is a traditional and widely recognised technique.\u201d\n\nWhen the leather arrives at Studio Sarta, it is cut and sewn together with Vienna straw, according to Giorgia\u2019s designs.\n\nThis blend of craftsmanship and contemporary style has resonated with buyers. In the company\u2019s first year, Studio Sarta sold 200 bags. Now, they sell 1,000 a year. Most of their clients are in Italy, France and the UK. In the next few years, they hope to expand to China.", "description": "Italy's handbags are a symbol of style and craftsmanship, but the leather goods market is now being thrown into flux", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/made-on-earth/why-made-in-italy-has-such-appeal/assets/images/social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
