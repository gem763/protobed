So that's one theory. I mean, I was smoking and doing a lot of drugs and a lot of everything. But at the same time, my lungs are totally clear. This is just my own theory, but the doctors say it's possible.'\n\nEddie's friend and TOTO guitarist Steve Lukather said 'health issues' were stopping the group \u2013 who are also made up of singer David Lee Roth, Eddie's brother Alex Van Halen, who plays drums, and Eddie's son Wolfgang Van Halen on bass guitar - from touring.\n\nThe band last performed in October 2015 at at L.A.'s Hollywood Bowl and there were rumors the band's classic lineup were set to perform for the first time since 1984.\n\nLukather told The Eddie Trunk Podcast in September: 'I love Ed and Alex, they've been friends of mine for 40 years.\n\n'Everybody wants Van Halen back \u2014 nobody more than me, because I still think they're one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time.

I think they're on a hiatus.'\n\nVan Halen last performed in 2015 at at L.A.'s Hollywood Bowl and there were rumors the band's classic lineup were set to perform for the first time since 1984.
