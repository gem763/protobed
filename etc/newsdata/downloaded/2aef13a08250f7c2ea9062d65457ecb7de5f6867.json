Well to get them from some of them. A little under half failed to provide full answers.\n\nWhen the charity collated the data it did receive it found that there were 2,538 such offences involving violence in 2018/2019, up from 1,805 the previous year. Including \u201cnon-violent\u201d offences, the shameful total came to 4,111.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of seriously nasty crime. Convictions? Not so much.\n\nSome 84 per cent of these cases went nowhere. Not so much as a \u201cmind how you go\u201d.\n\nA mere 7 per cent resulted in a caution or \u201ccommunity resolution\u201d. Just 6 per cent could be confirmed as having been sent either to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for charging or as having received a charge or summons.\n\nRemember too, that these were just the offences that were reported. I was once abused on a tube train and was told that I should have notified the police about it (it was theoretically non violent, although it felt threatening enough). I didn\u2019t because, as these figures make clear, I felt that there would have been little point in my doing so. I bet I\u2019m not alone.\n\nThe citizens of a civilised country would be appalled by this sort of thing. Sadly, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t think this one qualifies any more. Have you been watching the way the government behaves lately?\n\nI\u2019ve been writing about disability for just under a decade now and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not in the least bit surprised to see these sort of numbers.\n\nThey are the inevitable result of a climate that has been created by government and in wider society, under which a handful of disabled people, Paralympians and the like, are put on a pedestal and drooled over as inspiration porn while the rest of us are dismissed as inconveniences at best and dirty benefit scrounging weasels at worst.\n\nThe narrative from government ever since Iain Duncan Smith got hold of the Department for Work & Pensions has been to cast suspicion on just about any disabled person who is unable to hang a gold medal around their neck. And some of those that can.\n\nTabloid newspapers pour petrol on a blazing fire with extreme stories about \u201cscroungers\u201d, like the bloke who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro while claiming the PIP. These invite Bob the Bigot to conclude that if he\u2019s a crook it must mean that they all are.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the story about someone\u2019s friend of a friend who was told about some bloke that got disability benefit by claiming a bad back and now lives in the lap of luxury. It\u2019s become a meme. I was told a variant on it by an adapted car dealer.\n\n\u201cI can see you\u2019re struggling, but this bloke I heard of\u2026\u201d\n\nThose were his exact words.\n\nThe media mostly ignores stories about the difficulties we face, partly because there are so few disabled people working in it at any level.\n\nChannel Four makes an effort, but elsewhere? The BBC has a couple of correspondents with disabilities, and maybe you\u2019ll see a token wheelchair in a soap opera or two. Maybe.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has the brass neck to claim to be a world leader in disability rights when the UN accuses it of systematically violating them.\n\nAnd people buy that crap. \u201cIt\u2019s just the bloody PC brigade,\u201d the cry goes. \u201cThe UN should be looking at Russia, or China, or Iran, or something.\u201d\n\nAll these things and more combine to create a narrative that disabled people don\u2019t matter, and aren\u2019t worth being concerned about.\n\nThe message has been heard and understood. And Bob the bigot is left to take out his anger where he sees fit.\n\n\u201cCalm down dear. Look Alexa\u2019s told the woman down the road with the guide dog that the weather\u2019s nice enough to take it for a walk. Go and lay into her.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll feel a bit better, I guess. And if he can\u2019t catch up with her, he\u2019ll find someone else on this lovely kick a cripple day. Which, apparently, is every damn day.", "description": "Worried about the stress levels of the bigot in your life?
