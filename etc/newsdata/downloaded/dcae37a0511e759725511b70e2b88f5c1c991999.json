But this is an opportunity for those people to retire but be with friends and like minded people, but they do not require that high level of care.\n\n\u201cThere is an enormous growth in active, older downsizers wanting not just a more convenient and worry-free lifestyle, but also a more connected one.\"\n\nThe partners expect to spend another $36 million building the retirement facility which will be styled by interior design and furniture group Coco Republic, and feature one, two and three bedroom apartments.\n\nAmenities offered include a concierge, club room and bar, dining facilities, business amenities, infra-red sauna, gym, pool, cellar and cinema. It also will have 24 hour emergency assistance.\n\nCEO Todd Barlow, left, and chairman Rob Millner are looking to new revenue streams. Louie Douvis\n\nAt its September full-year results, Soul Patts posted a 7.2 per cent fall in full-year profit to $307.3 million and flagged a fresh focus on premium retirement villages as a new revenue stream.\n\nThe aged care business will sit alongside Soul Patts' others investments, which includes telecom\u00admunications, mining, pharmacy retailing and financial services. For the year to July 31, they generated total revenue of $1.6 billion, up nearly 38 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoul Patts chief executive Todd Barlow told the Financial Review the $5 billion listed investment company is looking to new earners that capitalise on longer-term trends, including retirement living and wealth management.\n\n\"The area that provided the most interest to us is the premium end (of retirement living), ... there is a good gap in the market to develop these assets,\" he said.\n\nMr Barlow said he was not worried about any fallout from the aged care royal commission as the sector they are investing in was a separate asset class.\n\n\"We are not going to compete with the highly regulated, high touch care operators,\" he added.\n\nSoul Patts is also looking to invest in financial services.\n\n\"It's taking advantage of [the] ageing population and the increasing wealth of those who have been contributing to superannuation for a long time,\" Mr Barlow said. \"Similar to aged care, [the] wealth management industry in Australia was providing poor advice.\n\n\"We see an opportunity to create a new business that is compliant with regulations and providing good service to Australians.\"\n\nMr Moran under the Provectus brand has luxury aged care sites across Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, the Gold Coast and China.\n\nThe new independent living business \u2018by Moran\u2019 is in talks with other developers and landowners about other projects which will enable a roll out of dozens of premium villages across Australia.", "description": "The $5 billion investment company is looking for new revenue streams by targeting empty nesters and retirees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4537%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f877211e34296756326f107126db715fdb601632", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
