Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have pushed unsubstantiated claims that the former vice president forced Ukraine to fire a prosecutor in order to make an investigation into his son go away.\n\n\u201cHow do you think his son is feeling after embezzling a lot of money?\u201d Eric Trump asked the audience Thursday. \u201cA lot of crookedness, he is not feeling too good. Maybe \u2018Lock her up\u2019 goes to \u2018Lock him up!\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump, naturally, was referencing the long-running \u201cLock her up!\u201d Trump rally chants that have been directed at former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton since 2016.\n\nAfter some in the crowd began taking up the chant, Eric Trump added: \u201cI like \u2018lock her up\u2019 a little bit more. but I don\u2019t know, I like that. That is a good idea.\u201d\n\nThe audience then embraced the chant as it reverberated throughout the arena for a sustained period of time. Trump appeared to bask in it throughout.\n\nAfter it died down, Trump told his father\u2019s supporters they didn\u2019t need to \u201clock him up\u201d because they would \u201cbeat the hell out of all of them, we are going to win.\u201d", "description": "\u201cHow do you think his son is feeling after embezzling a lot of money?\u201d Trump exclaimed. \u201cA lot of crookedness, he is not feeling too good.
