In the path it took, no. Read my FULL FEMA statement. What I said was accurate! All Fake News in order to demean!\u201d\n\nA little less than two hours later, Trump tweeted a third time: \"Alabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News!\"\n\n\n\nTrump on Wednesday was the subject of online mockery after an Oval Office storm briefing in which he showed off an apparently doctored National Hurricane Center projection of Dorian\u2019s early track that appeared to be hand-altered to include Alabama.\n\nBut when asked about what looked like a conspicuous Sharpie mark on the federal forecast at an event later in the afternoon, Trump repeatedly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and announced the White House would issue \u201ca better map\u201d with \u201cmany models\u201d advising that \u201cin all cases Alabama was hit, if not likely, in some cases pretty hard.\u201d\n\nTrump continued throughout the day Thursday to fire off tweets defending his position and the White House later released a statement from homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Rear Adm. Peter Brown, in which Brown said he told the president during a briefing Sunday that Alabama could still be affected by the storm.\n\nBrown said that his briefing to the president on Sept. 1 included \"the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama,\" and that some forecasts from the National Hurricane Center showed that possibility through Sept. 2. The possibility of Alabama to see increased winds was less than 10 percent, according to advisories from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nEric Trump, the president's son, also sought to attack journalists' coverage of the episode on Thursday \u2014 slamming a report by The Washington Post and sharing on Twitter a National Hurricane Center graphic dated Aug. 29 showing parts of Alabama with a 5 percent to 10 percent chance of receiving sustained winds in subsequent days.\n\n\"This pettiness from the @washingtonpost is exactly why the public hates the media,\" he wrote online. \"This is a basic graphic from the NHC - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s beyond comprehension that Alabama was in the path had the storm not gone North. Stop the BS. The Washington Post is a joke. #Alabama.\"\n\nIt is possible Trump was alerted to Dorian's potential effects on Alabama in early briefings, when disaster officials feared the hurricane could cross southern Florida, enter back into the Gulf of Mexico and turn toward the Panhandle. Such a path would have put Alabama in close proximity to the storm.\n\nStill, when Trump first tweeted Sunday that Alabama and a handful of states along the southeastern coast of the U.S. \"will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated,\" the National Hurricane Center already forecast that Dorian's trajectory had veered far from Alabama.\n\nAnd in a tweet roughly 20 minutes after Trump's weekend post, Birmingham\u2019s branch of the National Weather Service clarified that \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian,\u201d because its \"system will remain too far east.\"\n\nBut Trump's persistent focus on his own claim Thursday, which came as Dorian bore down on the coast of South Carolina, provoked fresh criticism. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., remarked that \"I feel sorry for the president,\" calling the controversy over the modified map \"humiliating\" and \"an embarrassing moment\" for the United States.\n\n\"What we're seeing there is literally pathetic,\" Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate, told CNN. \"It makes you feel a kind of pity for everybody involved, and that's not how I want to feel about the president \u2014 whether it's for my party or the other.\"\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/d0/94/78e439c5471981e284cbee8022d4/buttigieg.png\"\n\nAnother of Trump's 2020 challengers, Republican former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, had pledged Wednesday that \"if elected, I will NEVER redraw a National Weather Service map to cover up my own dumb mistake.\"\n\nFox News' Janice Dean, the senior meteorologist at Trump's favored cable network, pointed out Wednesday that \"Alabama was NEVER in the official cone\" forecast by the National Hurricane Center, and described the embellished map presented from the White House as \"inaccurate, misleading and fake.\"\n\nFormer FEMA administrator Craig Fugate on Thursday said emergency managers rely on National Hurricane Center forecasts \u201cwith no additions to that product,\u201d and chastised Trump for relitigating the Alabama dispute while Dorian continues to churn northward.\n\n\u201cYou know, if you're going to misstate something, that happens. You should just correct it and let it go. But it is, I think, a distraction from what we should be focused on,\u201d Fugate told MSNBC, adding that \u201cwe still have a lot of storm to go\u201d and citing ongoing response efforts in the Bahamas.\n\nNBC host and weatherman Al Roker also said Thursday the squabble was \u201ca bit of a distraction\u201d that \u201ccould have been easily tamped down,\u201d but wasn\u2019t. \u201cI think folks know who to depend on, and no disrespect to the president of the United States, but he's not in the business of doing forecasts,\" Roker told MSNBC.\n\nThe blowback appeared to embolden Trump on Thursday. He also retweeted a map plotting Dorian\u2019s likely paths that he first posted online Wednesday evening, which was dated Aug. 28 and appeared to originate from the South Florida Water Management District.\n\n\u201cThis was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages,\u201d Trump wrote in an accompanying message. \u201cAs you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!\u201d\n\nThat map included a disclaimer stating that \"NHC Advisories and County Emergency Management Statements supersede this product,\" and the graphic \"should complement, not replace, NHC discussions.\"", "description": "The president tweeted multiple times on Thursday about his dubious meteorological claim.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/169/1155968404_6083737993001_6083745742001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
