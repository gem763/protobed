The art of good manners, Korean-style", "language": "en", "text": "One of the biggest complaints about the wellness industry is that it often tries to convince us we\u2019ve got problems we didn\u2019t know we had in the hope that we\u2019ll fall for an expensive solution. This week, however, one of the latest self-help books drew my attention to an area in which many of us really are deficient. Nunchi. Have you got it? Have you got enough? Fortunately, Euny Hong is here to answer all our questions with her elegant manual The Power of Nunchi: The Korean Secret To Happiness and Success (Penguin, \u00a312.99).\n\nNunchi \u2013 which is pronounced noon-chee \u2013 is a Korean concept, which translates literally as \u201ceye measure\u201d. In brief it\u2019s the art of reading the room. Hong, who emigrated from the United States to Korea at the age of 12, calls it a \u201csuperpower\u201d. The need to consider the feelings and motivations of other people in any interaction is something that Korean children learn almost before they\u2019re able to walk and talk. It\u2019s about social and emotional intelligence. Korean mothers scold their children for not having enough nunchi. No Korean parent ever smiled indulgently when their kid stuck its tongue out at a stranger or asked Grandma \u201cWhy are you so fat?\u201d Manners are everything. To cause offence, even accidentally, is anathema. There are even children\u2019s books on the subject. These childhood lessons are hammered home at school and later in the workplace.\n\nI read The Power of Nunchi with a sinking feeling as Hong described the gaffes of a \u201cNo Nunchi\u201d type, generously including some of her own faux pas as illustrations. She describes how, arriving late to a dinner party, she burst into the dining room loudly complaining about her journey, only to discover that she\u2019d blundered in on another guest revealing a terminal cancer diagnosis. I recalled all those occasions when my own nunchi had deserted me. Like the time I asked a woman in the pilates studio changing room when her baby was due (it was already three months old). Or the time I explained the process of writing a novel to Hanif Kureshi. He looked very interested. Great nunchi, that man.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFortunately, Hong distils the secret of good nunchi into a few simple steps. She first counsels that before you head into a new social situation you should try to empty your mind of any preconceived ideas about what might be going on there. Instead, stand outside, take a couple of breaths and, as you enter the room, pause again to ascertain what\u2019s really going on by close study. Are people talking quietly (as was the case with Hong\u2019s dinner party)? Who\u2019s the centre of attention? Who\u2019s the alpha here? Where\u2019s the bar? Actually, Hong probably wouldn\u2019t ask that.\n\nShe did, however, advise that when you join a conversation you should be aware of what people aren\u2019t saying. Hong explains that Korean \u2013 like English \u2013 is a high context language, which means that much communication is based on an understanding of social signals that comes about only through having lived with the culture for a while. Consider that favourite English sign-off, \u201cYou really must come to dinner\u201d which anyone steeped in middle-class English culture knows means \u201cfor God\u2019s sake don\u2019t suggest a date\u201d.\n\nHow do you work out what\u2019s really being said if you\u2019re a newcomer? My favourite nunchi rule, and the one which seems easiest to implement, is \u201cnever pass up a good opportunity to shut up\u201d. Hong points out that in the West we have a horror of lulls in the conversation. I know that\u2019s true for me. I plan that next time I\u2019m talking to someone, if the conversation dips into silence, I\u2019ll just allow it to sit there and let the other person\u2026\n\nFinish my sentence? Of course you did. It\u2019s true that if you give people dead air to fill, they will rarely resist the urge to fill it and that may mean you find out something they weren\u2019t actually planning to tell you. As the silence stretches between you, a friend may really open up about a problem they\u2019ve been longing to share. Hong suggests that holding back can also help you ace that job interview. Leave the interviewer space to tell you what they want and what they\u2019re really offering so that you can then tell them you\u2019re exactly what they\u2019re looking for or, conversely, decide to look for another position.\n\nAnyway, the opportunity for me to apply these nunchi techniques arose on an evening out with an old friend. Before entering the pub where we were meeting, I took a couple of deep breaths. Bearing in mind the nunchi advice that you don\u2019t need to make a big entrance, I was careful not to slam the door as I stepped in. Alas, the wind had other ideas and the door crashed shut behind me, shaking the walls and causing a proper \u201cAmerican Werewolf\u201d moment. While I looked for my mate, I tried to read the room. No hipster beards. Jumpers over collared shirts. Lots of labradors sitting quietly beneath the tables. What did it all mean?\n\nI took a little too long to read the room so my friend eventually stood up from her chair and started waving: \u201cI\u2019m here! I\u2019m here!\u201d She greeted me with: \u201cWhen did you last get your eyes checked?\u201d Later, when she came to the end of an anecdote, where usually I would have jumped in with a complimentary anecdote of my own, I merely nodded and kept it zipped. Perhaps she would pick up the thread again by telling me how the incident in the car park at Waitrose had really made her feel. She didn\u2019t. Instead she said: \u201cAre you OK? You seem a bit\u2026\u201d She hesitated. \u201c\u2026Distracted tonight.\u201d\n\nHaving noticed that my friend wasn\u2019t drinking alcohol, I\u2019d gone alcohol-free too. Putting my distracted air and the lack of gin together, she went for a distinctly low-nunchi gambit. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d With better nunchi in mind, quickly adapting Hong\u2019s advice for dealing with farts \u2013 \u201cThink of a diverting question on an unrelated topic\u201d \u2013 I ignored my friend\u2019s gaff and asked what she thought of the peanuts. But the thing is, when my friend told me I seemed distracted, I swear it was on the tip of her tongue to say \u201cweird\u201d.\n\nWe all know a Nunchi Ninja, to use Hong\u2019s term. They never say anything wrong. At the same time because they never say very much at all they often leave you with an uneasy feeling. While they\u2019ll know that when you were six, you came last in a sack race and wet your knickers in front of the whole school, you\u2019ll never know their birthday. If you work with them, you probably won\u2019t know the name of their spouse. They\u2019ll leave the company without you ever having known whether they take one or two sugars in their tea (they take no sugar, stupid. Of course they don\u2019t take sugar). There\u2019s a sense that the Nunchi Ninja is building up a healthy stock of kompromat (compromising material). They\u2019re using the power of nunchi for evil. Even Hong herself points out that nunchi can be used for ill by the likes of professional \u201cpsychics\u201d.\n\nI think I\u2019d rather be a Nunchi Novice. If the point of nunchi is to smooth social relations, then a night out with old friends definitely needs a different approach from a business meeting. Hong\u2019s advice to hold back from jumping in with a joke or an anecdote to avoid a silence is solid. It\u2019s great to make space for your friends to share what\u2019s really on their mind but there are also moments when everyone wants the conversation to proceed like a game of netball, with the conversational ball being passed around deftly as one joke leads to another and everyone\u2019s pleased when there\u2019s a goal.\n\nThat said, I am of the belief that anyone who reads The Power Of Nunchi and doesn\u2019t find themselves blushing probably needs Hong\u2019s eloquent wisdom far more than they could ever know.", "description": "One of the biggest complaints about the wellness industry is that it often tries to convince us we\u2019ve got problems we didn\u2019t know we had in the hope that we\u2019ll fall for an expensive solution.
