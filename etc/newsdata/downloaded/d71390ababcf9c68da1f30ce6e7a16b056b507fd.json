After 27 years in the business, he understands that a big problem many folks have in retirement isn\u2019t that they haven\u2019t saved enough or invested wisely\u2014it\u2019s that they haven\u2019t laid out their life\u2019s goals and are left feeling deflated and unhappy. He wants his RIA firm\u2019s broad reach\u2014through 45 advisors, 11 offices, and a deep digital and radio presence (he\u2019s had a call-in financial radio show for 24 years)\u2014to address this problem. Hanson recently reflected with Barron\u2019s on his business model, the industry, and how he relates to clients.\n\nBarron\u2019s: Why bother with nonfinancial goals?\n\nHanson: We promote this idea in our industry of a goal to sit on some yacht drinking a cocktail. That isn\u2019t really what life is\u2014it would last about two hours. It\u2019s about relationships and meaning. When you leave the workplace, people risk losing relationships and their sense of purpose. A lot of people struggle at that age.\n\nSo as an investment advisor, how can you help?\n\nBy explaining that money is just a tool. The money can help accomplish what\u2019s important to them. Sometimes, people are still trying to get clarity on what\u2019s important.\n\nWhat drew you to the RIA space?\n\nI started my career with a large national firm where the approach was focused on finding new customers and selling financial products. I wanted to create an environment where we put long-term clients before new clients. We launched with very little capital and big ambitions, and over the years have grown to 160 employees and $4.5 billion under management.\n\nHow would you describe your strategy?\n\nWe focus on getting costs down on investments, but we\u2019re not just an investment shop. We provide overall financial planning and retirement guidance. We\u2019re not the cheapest firm in town\u2014if it\u2019s all about costs, people can set up an account at E*Trade. Our goal is to help people live rich and meaningful lives. All of our investments are publicly traded, so it\u2019s easy for clients to leave whenever they want. We like that, because it forces us to earn our keep every day.\n\nHow do you invest?\n\nWe aren\u2019t market timers. Look at where interest rates are today\u2014who would have thought? Stocks are expensive. Bonds are expensive. The danger of predicting where markets are going to go is that, if things go wrong, there could be dire consequences for life.\n\nWhat\u2019s your typical client?\n\nWe focus on the middle-class millionaire, the professional who worked hard and saved hard. We have much larger clients, but the majority have from $500,000 to $1 million. Most of our clients are more concerned about not going broke than becoming wealthier.\n\nYou\u2019ve made a number of acquisitions lately\u2014six in the past 18 months, including a tax-prep firm.\n\nThe average owner of an advisory firm is 64 years old; they want to retire. That\u2019s a succession plan issue.\n\nWe wanted to have CPAs who work directly with our advisors. Taxes can take such a big chunk out of wealth. Paying attention to taxes\u2014whether while selling an investment or taking a withdrawal from an IRA or considering a Roth IRA conversion\u2014can mean the difference between paying 15% [on profits] versus 35%.\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nEmail: editors@barrons.com", "description": "Scott Hanson recognizes that a big problem for a lot of people in retirement is that they haven\u2019t laid out their life\u2019s goals and are left feeling deflated and unhappy.", "authors": ["Karen Hube"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106624/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
