Here\u2019s how this couple turned around their Wisconsin neighborhood.", "language": "en", "text": "But Adams wasn\u2019t afraid. She started taking walks in the neighborhood and was gradually joined by others who told her they were sometimes hesitant even to go out and retrieve the mail.\n\nIt was during this time that she met Larry Adams, a contractor she hired to help fix the wiring in her house. After the job was finished, he asked Sharon out for ice cream and within a year, they were married.\n\nAD\n\nDuring their first Christmas together, in 1997, they were sitting in their dining room when Sharon wondered aloud about some flickering lights that had suddenly appeared in the dark, abandoned house across the street.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDo you suppose they\u2019re lighting candles?\u201d she asked her husband.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cThose aren\u2019t candles. They\u2019re crack pipes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Adams knew she needed to do more than her neighborhood walks. Several dozen homes that she had admired as a child were now boarded up or had been torn down. People regularly came to the neighborhood late at night to dump old tires, refrigerators and unwanted furniture into the weedy lots that remained.\n\nAD\n\nShe wanted to fix up her community.\n\n\u201cThere was crime in the neighborhood, but it was a symptom of total disrespect,\u201d she said, adding that authorities had razed a canopy of trees in the neighborhood years earlier for an expressway that never came.\n\nSoon, she and her husband formed a nonprofit organization called Walnut Way Conservation Corp., named after a main thoroughfare in Lindsay Heights. Sharon, who at the time coordinated service projects for the University of Wisconsin, and Larry, a contractor and electrician, found no shortage of residents who wanted to help them turn around the neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\nWith help from local redevelopment programs, grants, donations and dozens of volunteers, Walnut Way had soon fixed up the abandoned crack house that Sharon and Larry had seen light up on Christmas night.\n\nAfter the Victorian residence was gutted, refurbished and given a fresh coat of paint, the couple moved on to another house and fixed it up. Then another. Along with volunteers, they went street to street in the community of 2,700 households to renovate abandoned homes and vacant lots \u2014 more than 100 in all.\n\nMost of those initial homes were sold to first-time buyers through a low-interest loan program offered by the YMCA and Walnut Way, said Sharon Adams.\n\nAD\n\nSoon a grocery store moved into the area, along with a coffee shop and a smoothie cafe.\n\n\u201cWe celebrated one milestone at a time,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIf I\u2019d embraced the task as daunting, I might not have continued. So I embraced it as a desire of the heart.\u201d\n\nAs the years went on, they gutted and rebuilt crumbling interiors, transformed lots choked by weeds into fruit orchards, planted flower and vegetable gardens, painted fences and set up beehives, hoping to bring back some pride to their community.\n\nAD\n\nSome of the vacant lots and foreclosed homes were acquired from the city of Milwaukee, said Sharon Adams, while other homes were built or renovated with \u201cforgivable\u201d loans from the city. She and her husband also purchased and restored two homes, a commercial building and several vacant lots, she said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe both knew how to work with people, and our love for the neighborhood attracted other folks who also love it here and wanted to make a change,\u201d she said. \u201cOver time, it became a genuine community effort.\u201d\n\nThey were also happy to see crime drop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a wonderful thing to witness \u2014 slowly but surely, we\u2019ve made great strides,\u201d said Sharon Adams.\n\nIn 2007 \u2014 the earliest year crime statistics for Lindsay Heights from the Milwaukee Police Department were available \u2014 there were 365 serious crimes, including homicide, rape, robbery, burglary, assault and theft, law enforcement records show.\n\nThose crimes have decreased over the years as the Adamses\u2019 cleanup efforts have taken hold: Records show 211 serious crimes last year.\n\nTwenty years after they fixed up that first house, the couple is still at it, even though they\u2019ve retired.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a commitment, but it\u2019s one that we\u2019re happy to keep,\u201d said Sharon Adams. \u201cWe take a lot of joy in this. Year after year, we\u2019ve simply wanted to create a place were people would thrive.\u201d\n\nNow that the most run-down homes have been renovated or torn down to make way for green space, the Adamses, who are on Walnut Way\u2019s board of directors, will soon open a new project called Adams Garden Park, built with a 10-year $50 million commitment from Milwaukee\u2019s Zilber Family Foundation.\n\nOld buildings and the surrounding land are being transformed into gardens and workspace for businesses and charities that focus on environmental issues such as sustainable energy, landscaping and clean water and air, said Larry Adams.\n\nAD\n\nAlong the way, he and his wife were wholeheartedly embraced by the community.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like family,\u201d said Rosetta Bond, 33, a single mother who runs a catering business in a duplex renovated by the couple. \u201cThey\u2019re big-hearted people who treat everyone with respect and kindness, whether you\u2019re a janitor or a CEO.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a person in the neighborhood whose life they haven\u2019t touched,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen your neighborhood looks good, you feel better. Crime has gone down, and people now take pride in where they live, thanks to the Adamses.\u201d\n\nSharon and Larry Adams have also created opportunities for young people in their neighborhood through summer programs, job training and gardening projects, said Danielle Washington, 30, who the couple mentored when she was 16.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey provided me with avenues to express my interests and they gave me a voice,\u201d said Washington, who is now a graduate student studying epidemiology. \u201cThey\u2019re a breath of fresh air to the Lindsay Heights community.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, X\u2019Zayvion McCoy, said he\u2019s grateful for the Adamses\u2019 energy and commitment.\n\n\u201cShe and Larry have taught me it\u2019s not just about one person \u2014 it\u2019s about family, friends and the community,\u201d said McCoy, a former intern and education coordinator for Walnut Way who is now a student at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.\n\nAD\n\nSharon Adams said she considers it the ultimate compliment when someone she mentored decides to put down roots in Lindsay Heights and raise their children in the neighborhood she once happily roamed as a girl.\n\n\u201cThey can choose to live and work anywhere, but they choose to return here,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a beautiful feeling.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "After the crack house was gutted, refurbished and given a fresh coat of paint, the Adamses moved on to another house and fixed it up.
