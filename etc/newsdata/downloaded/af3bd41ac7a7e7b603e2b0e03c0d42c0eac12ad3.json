Started by three Dutch friends who share a fondness for taking pictures of their footwear against striking floor patterns, the feed curates images of marzipan-hued mosaics from all over the world. For over 812,000 followers, the timeworn entries of old hotels and hat shops from Lisbon to Los Angeles serve as a reminder to look down and appreciate the history beneath your feet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnsurprisingly, homeowners want to bring the bespoke, vintage feel of the eye-catching tile they see on social media into their own homes. That some of these mosaics look as if they require an advanced degree in mathematics and an abundance of time to lay out only adds to their allure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an appreciation for the way things used to be made,\u201d says Erin Oliver, vice president of Little Rock-based American Restoration Tile. \u201cMosaics aren\u2019t fast and they don\u2019t look like everything else on the market.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bieneman, mosaic tile first became popular in the United States in the late 1800s, when plumbing came indoors and the need for a sanitary surface became paramount for germ-obsessed Victorians. Porcelain flooring was imported from England, but as demand for indoor restrooms grew, American manufacturers started to produce smaller unglazed porcelain tiles. Soon basket weave, penny-round and hex designs became ubiquitous in homes. In commercial buildings, such as taverns and pharmacies, the mosaics grew more decorative, as the country transitioned from the Victorian era to the arts and crafts, art nouveau and art deco periods. Tile production peaked in the late 1920s, and then the Great Depression hit and many factories shuttered. \u201cAmazingly, we\u2019re now discovering patterns in old catalogues that were never even produced,\u201d Bieneman says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of the tile work Oliver is seeing today could be classified as traditional with a twist. \u201cPeople are trying a newer look using the old materials,\u201d she says. \u201cFor instance, they want flat hex tiles, but instead of black and white, we\u2019ll see more modern color combos like blues and grays.\u201d\n\nTo bring an authentic Old World feel to a home in Brooklyn\u2019s Park Slope neighborhood, designer Jessica Helgerson used hex tiles in an array of poppy hues. \u201cThe client was a young family with a real love for color, and the idea of small mosaics felt historically appropriate for the house,\u201d she says.\n\nDesigner Allison Tick took a similar approach for the attic bath of a Stanford White house in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., where she used mosaic tile to pay homage to the home\u2019s stately architecture. \u201cThe custom pattern is intended to enhance the rounded shape of the room and invoke the historical nature of the house,\u201d she says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut not all tile installations make a statement through color and pattern choice; some spell it out \u2014 literally. The typography trend, which started with hotels and restaurants trying to emulate old-timey signage, has crossed over into residential design, with homeowners using tile as a form of self-expression.\n\nIn a foyer, designer Bria Hammel used gray and white hex tile to craft a playful greeting. \u201cWriting \u2018hello\u2019 was a way to add some whimsy to a classic entry,\u201d she says. The space also features a custom gray border that flows into the adjacent powder room. Hammel admits getting the type right was a challenge. \u201cWe had limited options on the font style since the script needed to look fluid and be easily readable,\u201d she says.\n\nOliver says she\u2019s observed an increase in front entries that feature monograms and salutations, which is especially surprising in housing markets with frequent turnover. \u201cIf you embed your initials in the front entryway of your home, you\u2019re definitely making a commitment to staying there,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people want something highly personalized, I recommend doing the house number because the address isn\u2019t likely to change. It\u2019s a good way to put your mark on your home without the risk of losing resale value.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhether you\u2019re using tile to create a simple border or something more elaborate such as say, a pixelated Persian rug, there are a few basics to keep in mind. Historical reproduction tiles lie totally flat, so they\u2019re flush with the grout. Typically, made-to-order custom porcelain mosaics from both American Restoration Tile and Heritage Tile run between $25 and $30 per square foot, and that price includes design services. Many mass-produced porcelain mosaics are considerably less expensive. For example, a sheet of matte black and white hex mosaic with a snowflake design starts at $6.75 per square foot at Home Depot. Pattern and color choices are limited, however, and these tiles often have beveled edges, which result in a raised surface when installed. If you want your floor to look like an entryway or bath from 100 years ago, you\u2019ll probably want to opt for flat tile.\n\nMany companies will let you select colors and create a custom design using a computer grid on their website. Still, some creative homeowners prefer a DIY approach, especially when it comes to playing around with typography or doing a simple color change. Watch HGTV for any extended period and you\u2019ve probably seen someone manually pop out individual tiles from an adhesive-backed sheet and swap in a different color as an inexpensive way to customize mosaics. While this method works, it can be time-consuming; some companies will do it for you at no additional cost. \u201cOur pricing is based on complexity of pattern, so it doesn\u2019t increase for color changes,\u201d Oliver says.\n\nIf you happen to be a lucky homeowner with a vintage porcelain mosaic still intact, don\u2019t fret if you spy a crack. Because tile production was standardized for many years in the United States, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be able to find replacements in the right size and color to restore the floor. \u201cOur historical palette has matches for everything that was available from 1885 to 1940,\u201d Oliver says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOutside repairing the occasional crack, there isn\u2019t a ton of maintenance involved in preserving an unglazed porcelain mosaic floor. Because porcelain is impervious to water, stains and temperature changes, it\u2019s a durable and practical choice for high-traffic areas. \u201cIf you look at any 100-year-old tile floor, you\u2019ll see a natural patina that comes from wear, and that patina becomes a protective coat,\u201d Oliver says. \u201cThat\u2019s why all these beautiful tiles have been around for over a century; they\u2019ve stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nMore from Lifestyle:\n\nAD", "description": "The vintage look has been updated with a modern twist of color and imagination.", "authors": ["Michelle Brunner"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XyGRv0Jjnk3vlFOs_84runVEq6E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KHXMZFHK4II6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
