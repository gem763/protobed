I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s decision to remove the whip from the 21 Tories who rebelled last night - a move that in theory means they won\u2019t be able to stand for the party at the next election - is generating a furious backlash. We have already quoted Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader and a figurehead for moderate, centrist Conservatism. (See 8.13am.)\n\nOn Newsnight last night Ken Clarke, the former chancellor and now father of the house, also spoke out. He was one of the 21 who lost the whip last night, and he said he did not know if he would even vote Conservative at the next election. He explained:\n\nI am a Conservative, of course I am \u2026 But this leader, I don\u2019t recognise this. It\u2019s the Brexit party, rebadged .... [The party has] been taken over by rather a knockabout sort of character [Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff] who\u2019s got this bizarre crash-it-through philosophy \u2026 [And a] cabinet which is the most right-wing cabinet any Conservative party has ever produced. They\u2019re not in control of events. The prime minister comes and talks total rubbish to us, and is planning to hold a quick election and get out, blaming parliament and Europe for the shambles.\n\nFor the record, here is the list of 21 Tory MPs who voted against the government last night, and how have subsequently lost the whip:\n\nGuto Bebb\n\nRichard Benyon\n\nSteve Brine\n\nAlistair Burt\n\nGreg Clark\n\nKen Clarke\n\nDavid Gauke\n\nJustine Greening\n\nDominic Grieve\n\nSam Gyimah\n\nPhilip Hammond\n\nStephen Hammond\n\nRichard Harrington\n\nMargot James\n\nSir Oliver Letwin\n\nAnne Milton\n\nCaroline Nokes\n\nAntoinette Sandbach\n\nSir Nicholas Soames\n\nRory Stewart\n\nEdward Vaizey", "description": "Prime minister threatened to seek snap general election after crucial vote passed on Tuesday in Commons", "authors": ["Kate Lyons", "Simon Murphy", "Andrew Sparrow", "Aditya Chakrabortty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c07cd21d311bfe31bc9b8abe960afca9602fc1f/0_246_5032_3019/master/5032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bec90e10fa54e6b483f95dce34c950c"}
