BRK.B 0.36% to create a mini Berkshire of her own.\n\nMs. Britt Cool joined Berkshire in 2009 at age 25 as Mr. Buffett\u2019s financial assistant, a job he created for her. In 2014, she became chief executive of Pampered Chef, a cookware company owned by Berkshire.\n\nNow 35, Ms. Britt Cool wants to build an investment vehicle that acquires companies for the long term, like Berkshire does.\n\n\u201cI want to build a long-term platform and a long-term vehicle to acquire and build businesses,\u201d Ms. Britt Cool said in an interview. \u201cThere are companies that I think there\u2019s a lot of value in helping them get to the next level, but they\u2019re too small for Berkshire.\u201d\n\nMs. Britt Cool, who is based in Chicago, plans to leave Pampered Chef at the end of March. She will also resign from the board of Kraft Heinz Co. in the first quarter of 2020, she said. Ms. Britt Cool will remain on Blue Apron Holdings Inc. \u2019s board.\n\nIn her decade at Berkshire, Ms. Britt Cool specialized in helping Berkshire companies that were struggling. At various points, she served as chairman of Benjamin Moore & Co., Larson-Juhl, Johns Manville and Oriental Trading Co., meaning that those companies\u2019 CEOs reported directly to her. She took over Pampered Chef when its sales and earnings were falling.\n\n\u201cShe was the fireman,\u201d Mr. Buffett said in an interview. \u201cAnything I\u2019ve assigned her she\u2019s done a first-class job on.\u201d\n\nIn the second quarter of 2019, Pampered Chef\u2019s sales rose 19% and its pretax earnings rose 52% from the prior year, Mr. Buffett said.\n\nMs. Britt Cool has served on the Kraft Heinz board since 2015 and previously sat on the board of H.J. Heinz Co. Berkshire owns 27% of Kraft Heinz. The company\u2019s shares have dropped 34% this year due to weak sales, asset write-downs and accounting errors.\n\nAndrew Treanor, Pampered Chef\u2019s chief operating officer, will replace Ms. Britt Cool as CEO, she said.\n\nMs. Britt Cool grew up in Kansas and attended Harvard Business School. She first met Mr. Buffett on a trip to Omaha, Neb., where Berkshire is based, with a student group that she co-founded for women investors.\n\nShe worked for him for a summer in 2009, but the Berkshire headquarters didn\u2019t have an opening. Later that year, Mr. Buffett hired Ms. Britt Cool full-time as his financial assistant, initially to oversee Berkshire\u2019s involvement in Berkadia, a joint venture between Berkshire and Jefferies Financial Group Inc.\n\nAs financial assistant, \u201cI worked directly with Warren on anything that crossed his desk,\u201d Ms. Britt Cool said. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed learning about value investing and how to be an entrepreneurial-minded operator at the same time.\u201d\n\nMr. Buffett said he understood Ms. Britt Cool\u2019s decision because he also left a job he loved, at his mentor Benjamin Graham\u2019s investment firm, to work for himself in 1956. He added that he doesn\u2019t intend for Berkshire to invest in Ms. Britt Cool\u2019s new venture.\n\nMs. Britt Cool is one of the highest-profile women at Berkshire, which has three women on its board of directors and seven women CEOs at its operating companies. Some Berkshire watchers have speculated that she could take a future top leadership role at the company.\n\nMs. Britt Cool has played a major role at Berkshire in convening the company\u2019s dozens of CEOs to network and learn from each other. Ms. Britt Cool organized the first Berkshire CEO gathering in 2013, and they have been held annually in Omaha since. Berkshire CEOs say the gatherings are a highlight and have sparked new working relationships.\n\nMs. Britt Cool said she plans to apply the same strategies she used at Berkshire businesses to help small companies grow. She declined to comment on the structure of her venture or how she plans to fund it.\n\nMr. Buffett has famously struggled in recent years to find affordable companies to buy for Berkshire, as a decadelong bull market has pushed up company valuations. Due to Berkshire\u2019s size, Mr. Buffett is looking to deploy tens of billions of dollars at a time.\n\n\u201cThe toughest part is finding things to buy,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. But as Ms. Britt Cool will be targeting much smaller companies, he added, \u201cshe\u2019s got an easier job than I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nWrite to Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com", "description": "Tracy Britt Cool, one of Warren Buffett\u2019s key lieutenants in recent years, is leaving Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to create a mini-Berkshire of her own.", "authors": ["Nicole Friedman", "Nicole.Friedman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108305/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
