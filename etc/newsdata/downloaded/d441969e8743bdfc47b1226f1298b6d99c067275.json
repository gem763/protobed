At the end of his story-telling, King sang a rendition of \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d\n\nAlpha News reported:\n\nThe first book Russ read to the tots was called \u201cNeither\u201d \u2013 which explained how some people are neither a boy or a girl and are called \u201cthis or that or they.\u201d The second book he read was called \u201cRainbow\u201d \u2013 where he taught the kids the meaning behind every stripe in the LGB [sic] flag so they could pledge allegiance to the Rainbow Flag \u2013 not the American flag.\n\nAccording to the report, King wore \u201ca very short skirt and very high heels, and when he bent over, or his legs spread apart, he revealed his underwear to a dozen toddlers who sat before him.\u201d\n\nKing \u201chas his own website featuring hundreds of photos, where he is performing a variety of \u2018acts\u2019 on men in various stages of dress, which most would call \u2018soft porn,\u2019\u201d Alpha News added.\n\nThe headline of the Minnesota Sun\u2019s article about King\u2019s story hour read, \u201cDrag Queen Who Routinely Poses Half Nude Performed for Children in Richfield.\u201d\n\nThe Star Tribune fawned over King\u2019s Drag Queen Story Hour event, describing it as one that celebrates \u201ca love of stories, dress-up and accepting people just the way they are.\u201d\n\nThe report cast the librarians as brave and accepting and those who would protest an adult drag entertainer reading to young children as making \u201cugly talk\u201d:\n\nRichfield librarians were in force Saturday, dressed in their rainbow best and braced for trouble. Online, there had been ugly talk and threats of protests. Anyone who wanted to disrupt story time would have to get through a united front of book lovers in \u201cAll Are Welcome Here\u201d shirts.\n\nI am learning a LOT! pic.twitter.com/bO1BAgOPe3 \u2014 Jennifer Brooks (@stribrooks) September 28, 2019\n\nThe library announced its celebration of \u201cLGBTQIA+ History Month\u201d on its website.\n\nTomorrow is Stories Together with Drag Performers, featuring Gemini Valentine at Hopkins Library at 11am.

This includes a commitment to combating marginalization and underrepresentation within the communities served by libraries through increased understanding of the effects of historical exclusion.\n\n\u201cThis year, we have received some negative feedback from a very small minority of people\u201d Ashley Bieber, the county\u2019s youth services librarian, apparently told the Tribune about the story hour event. \u201cWe encourage them to attend an event and see for themselves the joy and happiness it brings children and families in our community.\u201d\n\nThe website of the Drag Queen Story Hour, an event targeting toddlers and young children, specifically states the purpose of the events is to provide children with \u201cglamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models.\n\nThe controversial drag queen events have stirred tensions in many cities throughout the country, such as Chula Vista, California, where an LGBT-activist city official said groups protesting the event were people who hold \u201cwhite supremacist beliefs.\u201d\n\nConcerns about safety at the Drag Queen Story Hour events made headlines recently when Houston MassResistance discovered drag queen Alberto Garza, who uses the name Tatiana Mala-Nina when reading to young children, had been convicted in 2008 of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old boy. The Houston library system had failed to perform a background check on Garza or any of the other drag queens appearing in its programs.\n\nMultnomah County Library in Portland, Oregon, also faced backlash when it was found the library system had quietly removed from social media photos of the Drag Queen Story Hour that took place at one of its libraries during which young children were lying on top of the drag queens and fondling their false breasts.\n\nBieber said children \u201care usually completely delighted to see a performer who is so open and willing to embrace just the extreme of dress-up, which is something all children enjoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just over the moon and fascinated,\u201d she said.", "description": "The Minnesota Hennepin County Library hired drag queen Russ King, an adult entertainer, to read to young children.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Drag-Queen-Story-Hour-Worm-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
