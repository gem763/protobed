The 34-year-old Austrian also finished in a tie for second in the Irish Open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played really well in the right events,\u201d said Wiesberger, who finished 16 under overall. \u201cJust really excited what\u2019s ahead of us in the last few events.\u201d\n\nWiesberger has 4,198 points in the Race to Dubai, ahead of Jon Ram (3,898), British Open champion Shane Lowry (3,535) and Fitzpatrick (2,865).\n\nHe joins Rahm, Alex Noren, Justin Rose and Danny Willett as multiple winners in the Rolex Series.\n\nIt was the seventh career win on the European Tour for Wiesberger, who missed the last seven months of last year with a wrist injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really good putting myself in positions and staying there,\u201d Wiesberger said after earning a winner\u2019s check of $1.1 million. \u201cI just really enjoy my time and being back out there, because I know how tough it was when I had to withdraw from these events last year. It\u2019s just really full enjoyment out there when I\u2019m in position.\u201d\n\nWiesberger also moved to a career-high 22nd in the world golf rankings, boosting his chances of making a Ryder Cup debut next year.\n\nAmerican Kurt Kitayama finished third, four shots behind Wiesberger and one stroke ahead of Andrew Johnston, Robert MacIntyre and Matthias Schwab.\n\nFrancesco Laporta was the top Italian in a tie for seventh while Andrea Pavan tied for 10th on his home course.\n\nWith a $7 million purse, the Italian Open returned to Rome after 17 years as the local federation attempts to boost interest ahead of the 2022 Ryder Cup at the nearby Marco Simone club .\n\nTotal attendance for the four days was 29,000.\n\n\u201cThis week couldn\u2019t have been better in terms of re-embracing Rome and preparing for 2022,\u201d said Italian golf federation president Franco Chimenti. \u201cWe had four days of perfect sunshine - which is something we\u2019re used to in Rome.\u201d\n\nChimenti announced that next year\u2019s tournament will also be played at Olgiata, before the tournament moves to Marco Simone in 2021.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AndrewDampf\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bernd Wiesberger moved atop the Race to Dubai rankings by winning the Italian Open on Sunday for his second Rolex Series victory of the year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dampf"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/italy_golf_italian_open_85568_c0-128-3072-1920_s1200x700.jpg?2791a79b282b5245e57d245c61336aa81c8132d8", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
