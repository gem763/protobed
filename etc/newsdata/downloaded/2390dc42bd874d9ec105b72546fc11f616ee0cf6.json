Sign up here.\n\nFinancial markets suffered another trade-related blow Friday on concern the Trump administration may move to limit U.S. investment in China, a move sure to raise tensions.\n\nThe S&P 500 turned lower after Bloomberg reported that officials are discussing ways to restrict portfolio flows into the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The index bounced around in the minutes after the headlines before extending declines, and Chinese firms traded in the U.S. were under pressure as investors assessed a move that would have repercussions for billions of dollars in investment pegged to major indexes.\n\nHere\u2019s what investors are saying:\n\nJennifer Ellison, principal at San-Francisco based BOS:\n\n\u201cThis is not little stuff. This is huge. The cost of tariffs on the economy, the impact on growth around the world when you don\u2019t have trade flowing, the potential impact of China getting really mad and looking at us and saying \u2018You know those Treasury bonds you\u2019re issuing? We don\u2019t want so much of that anymore,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more potential downside than there is upside when this is all resolved.\u201d\n\nEd Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda:\n\n\u201cJust like we saw in the previous lead-up to high-level talks in the past, the White House is trying to increase their negotiating chip count with a fresh threat that could cripple Chinese companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe limitation of American pension funds access to Chinese markets would see massive portfolio swings that spells disaster for the tech sector. This threat is harsh reminder that we could very easily see trade talks fall apart next month.\u201d\n\nEd Al-Hussainy, a strategist at Columbia Threadneedle:\n\n\u201cThis one is a non-starter. Even this administration will have a hard time making the case for capital controls at this scale. Just another market burp.\u201d\n\nAlan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Deutsche Bank AG:\n\n\u201cThis policy risks reciprocity from China, where China is of course a much bigger player in U.S. portfolio markets, than the U.S. is in China. In general, headlines like this also suggest that U.S.-China relations remain extremely tense, so not a great sign on the state of the trade negotiations. These headlines help assets that do well in \u2018risk-off\u2019 like gold, Swissie and yen. The euro likely also benefits in part as China could in theory search for alternative liquid markets,\u201d he said. \u201cOne important caveat to above is we need to see if these are just loose headlines with U.S. capital flows used as a bargaining chip, or whether the threat is real.\u201d\n\nZach Pandl, co-head of global FX and emerging-market strategy at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.:\n\n\u201cThe news opens up a new front in the U.S.-China trade conflict. Looks likely to weigh on the yuan and neighboring currencies, and support safe havens, especially the yen.\u201d\n\nMike Collins, senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another example of how every time people think this trade war is deescalating, it escalates again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in this for the long run. There\u2019s no end in sight.\u201d\n\nSebastian Janker, the head of the chief investment office for DB Wealth Management Americas:\n\n\u201cThe lack of details for implementation could signal that this is another negotiating tactic for the White House to use in the upcoming trade talks. It\u2019s hard to imagine exactly how such a policy could be enacted without hurting existing investors,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors should monitor the price action in U.S.-listed Chinese companies as proxies for measuring the propensity of enacting this potential new regulation.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Molly Smith and Sophie Alexander.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Vildana Hajric in New York at vhajric1@bloomberg.net;Katherine Greifeld in New York at kgreifeld@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Brendan Walsh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
