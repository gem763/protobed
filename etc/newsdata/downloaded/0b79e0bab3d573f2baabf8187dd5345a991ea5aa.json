If Rudy Giuliani is doing something it is because he\u2019s the lawyer for Donald Trump, and lawyers don\u2019t take actions that are not authorised by their clients.\u201d\n\nMr Sondland\u2019s testimony to three House committees was aimed at distancing himself from Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nMr Sondland said he was concerned the president delegated to Mr Giuliani foreign policy responsibilities that he thought belonged to the State Department.\n\nBut Mr Sondland followed Mr Trump\u2019s instructions anyway.\n\nHe insisted that he played no role in encouraging investigations of Mr Biden, telling politicians he thought it improper to invite a foreign government to conduct criminal probes to influence American elections.\n\nThe ambassador was the latest in a series of witnesses to be privately interviewed by three House committees conducting the impeachment investigation.\n\nHe was one of several current and former Trump administration officials who have provided new information \u2013 and detailed diplomats\u2019 concerns \u2013 about Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani and their attempts to influence Ukraine.\n\nWhite House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney defended Mr Giuliani\u2019s involvement in foreign policy, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s the president\u2019s call.\u201d Even if some people don\u2019t like it, he added, \u201cit\u2019s not Illegal. It\u2019s not impeachable. The president gets to use who he wants to use.\u201d\n\nMr Sondland\u2019s attempts to stand apart from Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani are notable since, unlike other career civil servants who have testified in the impeachment inquiry, he is a hand-picked political appointee of the president who contributed $1 million to Mr Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nHis appearance was especially anticipated since the text messages and other witness testimony place him at the centre of a foreign policy dialogue with Ukraine that officials feared circumvented normal channels and that is now at the centre of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn prepared remarks obtained by the Associated Press, Mr Sondland aimed to untether himself from any effort by the Republican president or Mr Giuliani to have a political rival investigated, joining other current and former administration officials who have communicated to Congress misgivings about the administration\u2019s back channel dealings with Ukraine.\n\nBut Mr Sondland\u2019s pivotal role in the dialogue, including discussions about a quid-pro-quo in which Ukraine\u2019s president would get a coveted White House visit in exchange for satisfying Mr Trump\u2019s push for corruption-related investigations, made some Democrats sceptical that he was not more closely involved.\n\n\u201cFor purposes of the impeachment inquiry, it really doesn\u2019t matter whether Sondland was a knowing participant in this scheme or if he was an unwitting pawn,\u201d said Ted Lieu as he left the deposition.\n\n\u201cHe was still executing the policies of Rudy Giuliani and Rudy was following the orders of the president.\u201d", "description": "Gordon Sondland told impeachment investigators he was `disappointed\u00b4 by the directive.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/02/wire-19866582-1571363932-876_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
