Hot and cold flushes. Agonising digestive discomfort. Just a few of the migraine symptoms that make attacks so much more than simply a headache. And, for thousands of sufferers, standard treatment may \u2013 at best \u2013 offer only intermittent relief.\n\nSo there was understandable excitement last year at a new injectable drug that was described as \u2018life-changing\u2019 by the patients who used it.\n\nAimovig \u2013 also known as erenumab \u2013 is the first treatment to target the process that leads to migraine symptoms.\n\nThe drug contains cloned immune cells that block a mechanism that causes blood vessels in the brain to swell, leading to an attack.\n\nClinicians claimed it was \u2018one of the most important advances in migraine therapy in decades\u2019. Yet, earlier this month, patients were dealt a huge blow when the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) \u2013 the NHS\u2019s spending watchdog for England and Wales \u2013 refused to fund it, even though health chiefs in Scotland have already given it the green light.\n\nAimovig \u2013 also known as erenumab \u2013 is the first treatment to target the process that leads to migraine symptoms\n\nNICE said there was not enough proof the drug was clinically more effective than existing treatments, such as regular injections of muscle-relaxing Botox.\n\nThe decision means NHS doctors have effectively been barred from using it until NICE reconsiders whether it is worth it or not.\n\nIn the meantime, hundreds of desperate patients have been paying around \u00a35,000 a year to private clinics for monthly injections of Aimovig in the stomach, thigh or arm.\n\nThose numbers are expected to rise further in the wake of NICE\u2019s rejection.\n\nOne such patient is dad-of-one and former tax accountant Phil Walsh, 69, from North Tyneside. He was forced to take early retirement at 54 due to severe migraines that struck almost daily.\n\nBut since starting on Aimovig last November, Phil says his life has been transformed.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve missed weddings and funerals because of migraines. No other treatments worked for long.\n\n\u2018But now my attacks are down to around one a week and my life has changed completely. I can\u2019t believe anyone could say it\u2019s not cost-effective.\u2019\n\nPhil first took the drug as part of a trial but is now forced to pay for it privately. \u2018I\u2019m lucky I can afford it, but it\u2019s terrible to think other people are being denied the chance at a normal life,\u2019 he added.\n\nMigraine affects around one in ten of the UK population. Over-the-counter painkilling tablets such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can help mild attacks. But more severe cases need drugs called triptans \u2013 as pills or nasal spray \u2013 that stimulate receptors in the brain disrupted by the attacks. Botox, epilepsy drugs and even some types of antidepressants are also used.\n\nThe NHS bill for prescription medicines to treat migraines is thought to be in excess of \u00a3250 million a year.\n\nAimovig is the first in a new class of drugs called CGRP inhibitors.\n\nThe drug contains cloned immune cells that block a mechanism that causes blood vessels in the brain to swell, leading to an attack (stock image)\n\nThese work by blocking the effects of a protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide, which is involved in transmitting pain signals to the brain and is found in increased levels during migraine attacks. At least two other similar drugs have been licensed and are due for NICE assessment in the next few months. But NICE barred Aimovig\u2019s use even though the drug is licensed to be used only after at least three other existing medications have failed.\n\nIt concluded it was \u2018very uncertain whether erenumab is more clinically effective\u2019 than Botox.\n\nThe London-based National Migraine Centre says it has prescribed the drug \u2013 which can be injected by patients in the comfort of their own home \u2013 to nearly 200 migraine sufferers over the past year or so. It says more than two-thirds reported an improvement in quality of life and 75 per cent said they would recommend it to other migraine sufferers.\n\nProfessor Peter Goadsby, from King\u2019s College London, is one of Britain\u2019s leading migraine experts and led the research into CGRP\u2019s role in triggering the agonising attacks.\n\nHe said the NICE rejection came as a big surprise. \u2018Most of us in the field thought it would get the go-ahead for chronic migraine,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s frustrating.\n\n\u2018Hospitals are strapped for resources and here we have a treatment that people can administer in their home.\u2019\n\nProf Goadsby called on NICE to reconsider its decision.\n\nExperts point out that whereas Botox has to be injected up to 30 times in a course of treatment by a trained health professional in a hospital clinic, Aimovig is a do-it-yourself jab that can be done at home.\n\nNovartis, which makes the drug, has offered to only charge the NHS for patients for whom it works.\n\nAfter almost two decades of near constant agony, Phil is now hoping to enjoy life holidaying with his 67-year-old wife, Elaine.\n\nHe describes how the condition left him bed-bound, unable to see properly and talking gibberish.\n\n\u2018I could be in bed being sick for a week,\u2019 he said. \u2018If I moved my head a fraction of an inch I would start throwing up and it could be like that for up to a week. On two occasions, I collapsed at work and colleagues thought I\u2019d had a stroke.\n\n\u2018It would start off with blurred vision, so bad I couldn\u2019t see anything. Then my fingers would go numb, followed by my mouth and tongue. That would be followed by a period, often lasting several hours, where I could not speak coherently.\n\n\u2018I knew what I wanted to say but it came out as a load of rubbish.\u2019\n\nAfter repeatedly having to cancel meetings with clients, Phil took the difficult decision to retire early.\n\nTwice he has been admitted as an inpatient at King\u2019s College Hospital after being crippled by blinding migraine attacks. Despite trying an array of medicines \u2013 including triptans and epilepsy drugs \u2013 nothing worked. Botox provided some short-term relief but it too eventually stopped working altogether.\n\n\u2018I loved my job,\u2019 says Phil. \u2018If this drug had been available then I wouldn\u2019t have needed to retire. There will be other people in that situation now.\u2019\n\nHe is convinced it is worth every penny \u2013 if only because it means he can now enjoy time with his grandchildren. \u2018I\u2019m able to do more with them than I could before I had the injection because if I had a bad headache, I was incapable of doing anything,\u2019 he says.", "description": "The NHS's spending watchdog for England and Wales refused to fund Aimovig, even though health chiefs in Scotland have already given it the green light.", "authors": ["Matthew Walklett For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/17/19924546-0-image-a-9_1571501937070.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
