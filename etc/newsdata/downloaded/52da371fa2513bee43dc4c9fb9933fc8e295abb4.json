This is the new blue/gold dress haha.\"\n\nPopstar, Lizzo, also posted about the shoe debate saying, \"I see grey and teal, but my whole team sees pink and white help.\"\n\nMany, including Lizzo, are sharing photos with the sneaker stating, \"Right and left brain dominant, if ur right brain is dominant, us will see combination of pink and white color, and if ur left brain is dominant, u will see it in grey and green color.\"\n\nThis \"pink or gray\" sneaker originally made headlines in 2017, but has resurfaced and has lots of people confused all over again.\n\nSo, what's your take? Pink or teal?", "description": "The viral Vans sneaker is making a comeback, and celebrities such as Will Smith and Lizzo are weighing in.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/shoe-color-ht-jt-191014_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
