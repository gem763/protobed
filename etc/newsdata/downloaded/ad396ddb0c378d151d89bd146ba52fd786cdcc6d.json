Apple told the maker of the HKmap Live app: \u201cYour app contains content \u2013 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2013 that is not legal \u2026 specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\"Your app contains content \u2013 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2013 that is not legal \u2026 Specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.\"@Apple assume our user are lawbreakers and therefore evading law enforcement, which is clearly not the case. \u2014 HKmap.live \u5168\u6e2f\u6297\u722d\u5373\u6642\u5730\u5716 (@hkmaplive) October 1, 2019\n\nThe makers have argued that other apps have taken exception to these laws as they simply provide location data, if these rules were to be applied universally location-based apps such as Waze would also be banned. But, the app is used solely to track police activity and protest movements. The Register notes that as of 3:00 am Hong Kong time, messages on the app read: \u201cAfter the tear gas was applied, the police officer immediately returned to the police station.\u201d Another reads: \u201cFour flashing lights parked at the police station door.\u201d\n\nThe makers of the app complained that \u201cApple assume our users are lawbreakers and therefore evading law enforcement, which is clearly not the case.\u201d Hong Kong protests have escalated recently and are now in their fifth month with neither side appear to back down. The Chinese government is attempting to crack down on unrest but is hesitant to intervene militarily out of fear that it could result in a situation similar to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.\n\nProtesters are angered by China\u2019s growing influence over the province, beginning with a new bill that would make it easier to extradite people to China\u2019s mainland from Hong Kong. When the legislature refused to withdraw the bill and used harsh police tactics to crack down on protesters, the situation escalated drastically. HKmap Live service is also available on the Web so it isn\u2019t entirely reliant on the now-removed iPhone app and Apple users in Hong Kong will still be able to access the service for as long as it remains online.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
