Shares of Apache Corp (APA.N), Helmerich and Payne (HP.N) and Cimarex Energy (XEC.N) jumped between 12% and 17% and led gainers on the S&P 500.\n\nThe Saudi-led military coalition battling Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement said the attacks were carried out with Iranian weapons, raising the prospect of a global conflict involving the United States and Iran.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. investor is waiting with bated breath about what the U.S. and its allies might do,\u201d said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnticipation of higher fuel costs drove down shares of airlines and cruise line operators with the S&P 1500 airlines index .SPCOMALI shedding 2.1%, while Carnival Corp (CCL.N) fell 3.2%.\n\nThe S&P 500 retailing index .SPXRT lost 1.4%, with retailers, which would be hurt by higher fuel prices, among the biggest drags on the S&P 500.\n\n\u201cThe drone strike in Saudi has had an impact on how investors are looking at the security and stability of the global energy supply chain and is fueling a degree of risk reassessment,\u201d said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny\u2019s Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York.\n\nShares of defense companies Raytheon Co (RTN.N), Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) rose more than 2%. J.P. Morgan upgraded Raytheon shares to \u201coverweight.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.52% to end at 27,076.82 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.31% to 2,997.96.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.28% to 8,153.54.\n\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower.\n\nWall Street's more than a decade-long rally continues to hinge on whether the Fed will keep cutting interest rates and on progress in U.S.-China trade talks. A recent easing in trade tensions has brought the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX about 1% below its record high.\n\nAmong other movers, General Motors Co (GM.N) fell 4.2% after the United Auto Workers went on strike on Sunday, the first nationwide strike at GM in 12 years.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 12, 2019.
