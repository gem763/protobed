He said the expression was synonymous with \u201ccreepy old man\u201d and was not meant to \u201caccuse Mr Unsworth of engaging in acts of paedophilia\u201d.\n\nMusk also claimed an August 2018 email to a BuzzFeed News journalist in which he referred to Mr Unsworth as a \u201cchild rapist\u201d was based on a private investigator\u2019s report that he did not know at the time was false.

The investigator, James Howard-Higgins, was jailed in 2016 for stealing more than \u00a3420,000 from his maritime company\u2019s accounts.\n\nMr Howard-Higgins told Mr Musk that Mr Unsworth had met his wife when she was \u201cat least 18 or 19 years old\u201d but the inventor \u201cnonetheless told the BuzzFeed reporter that Mr Unsworth is a child rapist who married a 12-year-old child bride,\u201d noted the document, which added the diver had in fact met his partner when she was 32.\n\nThe investigator, who admitted to Mr Musk that none of his information had been verified, was offered a $10,000 (\u00a38,200) bonus for \u201csuccessful confirmation of nefarious behaviour\u201d by Mr Unsworth, whose lawyers said the bonus was \u201cnever paid before no such evidence exists\u201d.\n\nHaving failed to uncover dirt on the diver, the court documents allege, Mr Musk ordered Mr Howard-Higgins to \u201cimmediately move forward\u201d with leaking information to the UK press \u201cto plant an unflattering story\u201d about Mr Unsworth and young girls \u201cwithout any disclosure that it was coming from Elon Musk\u201d.\n\nThe case is set to go to trial on 22 October.", "description": "Elon Musk paid a convicted fraudster to smear a British diving hero who he baselessly called a paedophile,\u00a0according to court documents.
