And for every fitness level.\n\nNext time you visit the Zulu Kingdom, be sure to factor in one or more of these serotonin-spiking activities:\n\nThe wild swing\n\nFor the very brave. Very, very, very brave.\n\nI've visited the KZN area now three times this year. And every time I go, I hear about Oribi Gorge Nature Reserve and the wild swing. A canyon situated in southern Natal, it promises anyone who visits the trill of a lifetime.\n\nWATCH: Chasing shade in the Drakensberg - wining, dining and ziplining\n\nSwing your way to greatness from the top of Lehr\u2019s Waterfall, the highest swing of its kind in the world.\n\nI met two people who actually took this epic leap. And I could still see the fear in both their eyes months after they did it. \"When you do it, you are reborn. You don't come back the same person,\" one of the guys say.\n\nBut he's still glad he did it.\n\nZiplining\n\n(Karkloof Canopy Tour. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\nWhether you're in Howick or in the middle of the Drakensberg, it's guaranteed that you'll find a zipline around every corner. Some more extreme than others, I was introduced to ziplining at Champagne Castle Adventure Centre, offering less daunting options than, say, those found at Karkloof Canopy Tour that'll see you slide in between 10 zip-lines and 12 platforms - one of which is 200m long - as you take in the magical views of Karkloof Forest Reserve.\n\nGo hike or run\n\nWe recently discovered the wonderful hiking landscape of Durban. From Beachwood Mangroves Nature Reserve to the Shongweni Dam, there is a hike out there for everyone - close to the city centre of Durban, nonetheless.\n\nREAD: Unexpected city itineraries: Hiking in Durban\n\nBut running is also big in the Midlands, in particular. Whether it's a 5km fun run from The Windmills Ultrastop, N3 Nottingham Road, Curries Post Interchange or the annual Christmas Marathon - Nottingham Road is a great area for running. Views are unparalleled, hills are challenging, and there are plenty of places to rewards yourself with a coffee and a slice of cake or a homemade pie after you've crossed the finish line.\n\nMountain biking\n\nGo to Kokstad and explore seven routes through the Ingeli Forest on mountain bike. Whether you're keen on a chilled scenic cycle or a hectic 30km ordeal, a variety of trails start at the Ingeli Forest Resort. It is also a beautiful place to go hiking, or trail running.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
