One is two and a half and the other is 10 months. I spend over 50 per cent of my wages on childcare a month. While this has not stopped me from working because I am fortunate that my partner and I earn fairly well, it stops many others.\n\n\u201cThe cost of childcare punishes women and the cost is crippling. There is no point going to work if it is going to cost you because of childcare. I speak to hundreds of women who cannot progress their careers because childcare is so expensive. They can\u2019t find flexible work so are forced into low-paid, part-time work so that they have time to do childcare.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason behind the gender pay gap. In most circumstances, if you are not working full-time, you have less access to pay promotions, career progression and even training in some cases. In most cases, you are seen as a liability and less committed if you work part-time. We are limiting the potential of women and I find that scary. We hear stories of women who are doctors and teachers who are struggling.\u201d\n\nMs Haddad said anxiety over the cost of childcare causes \u201cstress\u201d on relationships \u2013 saying \u201cfinancial pressure\u201d is a \u201chuge reason\u201d why marriages and relationships end.\n\nJoeli Brearley, founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, described the cost of childcare as \u201cpunitive\u201d and said the current system was failing parents, childcare providers and childcare staff.\n\nShe added: \u201cIf we are to change the landscape for women, and parents, we need to provide properly subsidised childcare from nine-months-old. The government has introduced 30 hours\u2019 \u2018free\u2019 childcare for from three years old, and tax-free childcare for employees. This is not enough and impacts not only the parents but childcare providers as they are unable to cover the cost of delivery.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Until more support for childcare costs is effectively targeted towards parents on lower incomes, we will continue to see single parents locked out of good quality work and struggling financially.\u201d\n\nA Government spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are investing record amounts in childcare and early education, including around \u00a33.5bn on our free early education entitlements this year alone \u2013 and 600,000 three and four-year-olds have benefited from a 30 hours place in the first two years of the delivery of the programme.\n\n\u201cWorking parents are also benefiting from help with their childcare costs through Tax-Free Childcare and Universal Credit. We want to support early years providers in delivering high quality care and education, which is why we recently announced an extra \u00a366m to increase hourly rates for the Government\u2019s free hours offers for 2020-21.\u201d", "description": "Almost a fifth of parents have been forced into quitting their jobs due to the extortionate cost of childcare in the UK, new research has found.
