Here\u2019s what it signals: Even if Bernie won\u2019t be with us forever, his socialist movement will be.\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d\n\nThe anticipated endorsement of Bernie Sanders as her preferred candidate for president by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday will not determine the winner of the Democratic presidential primary. Endorsements almost never matter. But this one does\u2014for the future of the Democratic Party, not the future of its 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nThe timing of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement sends a sharp message to the party establishment and the progressive movement: We socialists are not here for Elizabeth Warren\u2019s reformed capitalism. We socialists want socialism, and we\u2019re not keeping quiet until we get it. Ocasio-Cortez seems to be telling us that Sanders and his movement will still be with us when he\u2019s gone\u2014and that she aims to be the one who leads it.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOcasio-Cortez is making her move at a pivotal point in the race. Warren has eclipsed Sanders as not just the left-wing frontrunner, but the race\u2019s frontrunner, leading or tied for the lead in most national and early state polls. Two weeks ago, Sanders suffered a heart attack, raising serious questions about whether his campaign could even continue. If Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t see a significant difference between Warren and Sanders, or if she wanted to cozy up to Warren and be seen as part of her team, she would have great incentive to endorse Warren, urge her fellow socialists to join her, and help squelch any ideological skirmishing on the left.\n\nSome progressive commentators worry that friction between Warren and Sanders\u2014or more accurately, between Warren and Sanders supporters\u2014is hurting the chances of progressives to sideline the party\u2019s moderates and the donor class. \u201cAll you people squabbling at your desks about whether Warren or Sanders is scarier to big money are missing the damn point,\u201d scolded Time editor-at-large Anand Giridharadas on Twitter. \u201cTogether they make up a two-headed populist uprising against plutocracy.\u201d Late last month, The Nation\u2019s editor, D.D. Guttenplan, advised progressive voters not to choose between Warren and Sanders until absolutely necessary. Instead, \u201chope the two candidates maintain their truce, competing to outdo each other in the boldness of their ideas and the breadth and passion of their support,\u201d he wrote.\n\nYet Ocasio-Cortez is choosing, provocatively so. To make the endorsement at this moment is to say: Not so fast, Elizabeth.\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders want big tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations, single-payer health insurance, free public college, easier union organizing and tougher trade deals. Both have eschewed hitting the large donor circuit, stress that their agendas are designed to empower the poor and working class, and threaten the power of consolidated wealth. Both have scoffed at bipartisan incrementalism.\n\nHowever, if you are a committed socialist, the differences between Sanders and Warren are crucial. Nathan Robinson of the influential socialist magazine Current Affairs last month detailed his problems with Warren. Some were rooted in tactical concerns that she wouldn\u2019t build a political operation to overwhelm the ruling class, as she\u2019s a \u201claw professor\u201d and not a \u201cmovement-builder.\u201d But at bottom, Robinson wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t like to say that I can\u2019t trust Elizabeth Warren, but I can\u2019t.\u201d He pointed to this year\u2019s State of the Union address: \u201cDonald Trump promised that America would \u2018never be a socialist country.\u2019 Warren stood up and applauded, as Bernie sat and fumed. This was a very clear \u2018Which side are you on?\u2019 moment.\u201d\n\nAt a similar moment, Ocasio-Cortez has chosen to remind everyone of which side she\u2019s on.\n\nThe differences are not strictly symbolic or theoretical. Take climate. Sanders envisions a truly massive federal government intervention to avert the climate crisis: a $16.3 trillion investment over 15 years, including the establishment of public ownership of electric utilities. Warren not only puts far less money on the table, but she also believes the profit motive can help protect the climate. Asked during the CNN climate forum whether she agreed with Sanders on public ownership, Warren stuck to her capitalistic guns. \u201cGosh, you know, I'm not sure that that's what gets you to the solution,\u201d she said, and added, \u201cIf somebody wants to make a profit from building better solar panels and generating better battery storage, I'm not opposed to that.\u201d\n\nWarren has echoed Sanders on single-payer health insurance, even weathering question after question about how much she would raise taxes to pay for it. But the fact that she hasn\u2019t always held that position, and still hasn\u2019t released her own detailed plan, leads some to challenge the depth of her commitment. The socialist hosts of the Chapo Trap House podcast torched Warren in June for having a plan for everything but health care. Said one, \u201cAll of sudden all the specificity and granular policy \u2026 goes out the window when it comes to one issue that directly challenges a key constituency of the Democratic elite.\u201d\n\nSure, they both propose taxing wealth, not just annual income. But Sanders is more aggressive, with higher rates levied on a broader class of multimillionaires, bringing $1.75 trillion more in revenue over 10 years. And he is more rhetorically aggressive. \u201cI don't have a beef with billionaires,\u201d said a somewhat charitable Warren in the last debate. Compare that with Sanders, who has said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that billionaires should exist.\u201d Sanders has also acknowledged his wealth tax \u201cdoes not eliminate billionaires\u201d and that the day billionaires cease to be is \u201cnot tomorrow.\u201d But it is clear he wants that day to come. His endgame is not her endgame.\n\nSanders put it plainly in a recent interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cElizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d (Her exact words were, \u201cI am a capitalist to my bones\u201d and she has also talked of her \u201clove\u201d of \u201cwhat markets can do.\u201d)\n\nTo some, this looks like semantics. The fact that Sanders does not have a platform of immediate government command over the entire economy has made some question not only the significance of his differences with Warren, but also why he even bothers to call himself a democratic socialist. Sanders even said in August: \u201cThe private sector is the sector of society which creates most of the wealth in America. And I want them to continue to do that\u201d albeit checked and balanced by a \u201cvibrant public sector.\u201d\n\nStill, by expressing a desire for government to own at least some of the means of production, and to place a ceiling on how much wealth individuals can accumulate, Sanders forces us to take his socialistic language seriously. Certainly, Ocasio-Cortez does.\n\nFox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham views Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement through the lens of crass political self-interest. \u201cI keep thinking it\u2019s really about a future presidential run for AOC,\u201d Ingraham said. But if Ocasio-Cortez were primarily concerned with her own political ambition, the safer move would be to help the progressive with the best chance of winning the nomination get over the top, and be credited for helping to unify the party. An even safer move would be not to endorse at all.\n\nThe more obvious explanation is that Ocasio-Cortez wants to keep the socialist flame burning. Sanders is 78 years old and is in the twilight of his career. If the socialist movement that he has built is going to last, the torch must be passed. Ingraham may well be correct that Ocasio-Cortez wants to take that torch and eventually run for president herself. She would be just barely constitutionally eligible when she turns 35 in 2024. But her Sanders endorsement signals what kind of presidential campaign that would be\u2014a direct descendant of the Sanders efforts that have put building a durable socialist movement in America above short-term electoral considerations.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Ocasio-Cortez will use the socialist torch to burn down the Democratic Party. She has said she will \u201csupport whoever the Democratic nominee is,\u201d even if it\u2019s Joe Biden, whom she politely criticized as someone who \u201cdoes not particularly animate me.\u201d\n\nShe told the New York Times last month of her time in the House so far, \u201cI think I have more of a context of what it takes to do this job and survive on a day-to-day basis in a culture that is inherently hostile to people like me.\u201d The Times noted she has \u201ccut back on her appearances on behalf of Justice Democrats,\u201d a left-wing organization that specializes in primary challenges, and replaced a publicly combative chief of staff with one who is \u201csober-minded.\u201d\n\nSo Ocasio-Cortez is prepared to remain in the Democratic fold, but her endorsement of Sanders means she has no intention of shelving the socialist banner in the process. The Democratic Party\u2019s big tent has long been filled with ideological tensions between moderates and progressives, but now there is also friction between progressives and socialists. And considering that Ocasio-Cortez is 48 years younger than Sanders, you can be sure that the socialist wing of the Democratic Party is not going away anytime soon.", "description": "Here\u2019s what it signals: Even if Bernie won\u2019t be with us forever, his socialist movement will be.", "authors": ["Bill Scher"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d4/e5/487771364129ad43928f00b520dc/191018-aoc-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
