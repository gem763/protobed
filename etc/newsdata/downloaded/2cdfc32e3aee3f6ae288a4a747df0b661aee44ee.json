And we have to give him the fact he has moved country, leagues and is as young as all the young \u00adplayers we are talking about.\n\n\u201cHe has just turned 21. So if anyone is getting too \u00adexcited about this, they should calm down, frankly, \u00adbecause he has \u00adalready started five games for us.\n\n\u201cWhat he needs to do is work daily, and work to show within the group that he \u00addeserves to play \u2013 as all the players do.\"\n\nPulisic joined the club in a \u00a358million move from B in January before being loaned back to Borussia Dortmund for the remainder of last season.\n\nThe American was confirmed as a Chelsea player over the summer and joined up with his new teammates ahead of their pre-season tour.\n\nChelsea face Southampton on Sunday as they look to continue their three game win streak.", "description": "American attacking midfielder has been frustrated with his lack of game time this season", "authors": ["Adam Payne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Chelsea Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20149975.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Norwich-City-v-Chelsea-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
