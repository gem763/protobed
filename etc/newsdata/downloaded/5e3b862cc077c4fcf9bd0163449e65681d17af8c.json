Next up is Austin, Texas, where we follow firefighter Rob Lowe as he saves Texas from exploding buildings, raging fires, huge storms, and the like. He also line dances in a bar with Liv Tyler, who plays a police officer, which isn\u2019t as cool as finally letting her go to space, but is still nice. Lone Star will premiere in January, so make sure your anti-anxiety medications are stocked.\n\nRelated", "description": "Rob Lowe and Liv Tyler star in the trailer for the disaster show 9-1-1: Lone Star, which is a Texas-set spinoff of the Los Angeles-based regular 9-1-1.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/21/21-rob-lowe.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
