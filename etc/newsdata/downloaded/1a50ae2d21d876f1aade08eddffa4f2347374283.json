REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nChina has been nervous that the United States is seeking to sever, or at least severely curb, economic ties in what has been called a \u201cdecoupling\u201d. Beijing fears that the Trump administration wants a complete separation with China.\n\nThe two countries have been working to resolve their trade dispute, with the United States announcing a \u201cphase 1\u201d deal with China on trade matters and suspending a scheduled tariff hike for October.\n\nSpeaking in Beijing at a high-profile Chinese military forum, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Chad Sbragia sought to place relations in a more positive light.\n\n\u201cOne area that I would comment and challenge on is - I\u2019ve heard this on this panel and other panels - the idea that the United States approach is fundamentally based on decoupling,\u201d Sbragia said at a panel on the sidelines of the Xiangshan Forum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you from personal experience that\u2019s not only not official U.S. policy, that\u2019s not even a policy discussion that I hear in my day-to-day business. That\u2019s not even how we think about that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf decoupling was actually the practice, what you would see on a day-to-day basis would be fundamentally different than what you see.\u201d\n\nWhat the United States is trying to do is \u201crebalance and right relationships to ensure that we have equity\u201d, Sbragia, who is leading the U.S. delegation to the forum, added.\n\nBoth countries want to enhance stability and deepen their relationship to reinforce crisis avoidance, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the opposite of decoupling. It\u2019s not to pull apart. It\u2019s actually to in some ways deepen those relationships.\u201d\n\nThe United States and China have bickered over other areas, including the disputed South China Sea and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, with Beijing especially nervous about U.S. military activity in what it views as China\u2019s backyard.\n\nSbragia said Washington wanted an open, free and inclusive Indo-Pacific region based on certain principles, including peaceful resolution of disputes, freedom of navigation and overflight, and fair trade and investment.\n\n\u201cOur treaty alliances in the Indo Pacific are not maintained as a relic of Cold War thinking, as some contend, but are manifestations of our enduring commitment to ensuring our allies and partners are secure in their sovereignty,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cOur inclusive vision extends to China as well. Competition with China does mean conflict, and the United States will not ask any country to choose between Washington and Beijing. That\u2019s not how the logic of our framework, our approach, is set.\u201d", "description": "The United States is not seeking to \"decouple\" from China and not asking any country to choose sides, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday, offering a softer outlook on relations bruised by a bitter trade war.", "authors": ["Ben Blanchard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443321482&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0RE", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
