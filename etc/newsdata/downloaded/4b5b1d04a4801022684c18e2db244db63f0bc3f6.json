We're not saying seven-year-olds have to choose their careers now but we must fight to keep their horizons open,\" says Mr Schleicher.\n\nHe is backing the Education and Employers' efforts to bring people from the world of work into schools, with the aim of widening access to the jobs market and raising aspirations.\n\n\"It's a question of social justice and common sense to tackle ingrained assumptions as early as possible or they will be very tough to unpick later on,\" says Mr Schleicher.\n\nLight-bulb moment\n\nThe OECD education chief will speak at an Education and Employers event in London on Tuesday, where the charity will announce plans to double to 100,000 the network of people who go into schools and talk about their jobs and career paths.\n\nAt present there are more than 50,000 volunteers, representing jobs from \"app designers to zoologists\".\n\nImage caption Young people need to hear about a wider range of jobs and employers, says the study\n\nThe intention is to create \"light-bulb moments\" where young people can see a possible new direction and hear from role models.\n\nResearch for the careers report shows that young people often have very narrow ideas about potential job options.\n\nThe most common influences are the occupations of people in their family, the jobs they see in the media and the type of work they see as most likely for people of their gender and background.\n\n'Out of reach'\n\nThe findings show that in primary school, boys from wealthier homes are more likely to expect to become lawyers or managers while girls from deprived backgrounds are expecting to go into hairdressing or shop work.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Career ambitions can often reflect the influence of family background rather than ability\n\nBoys from deprived backgrounds were particularly likely to want to go into careers such as sport or entertainment.\n\nMr Schleicher warns of a mismatch between the limited range of aspirations and the changing demands of the jobs market.\n\n\"Too often young people's ambitions are narrowed by an innate sense of what people from their background should aspire to and what's out of reach,\" says Nick Chambers, chief executive of Education and Employers.\n\n\"The importance of exposure to the world of work at primary age cannot be overstated,\" says Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers.\n\n\"The earlier children's aspirations are raised and broadened, the better.\"", "description": "Young people are often trapped by a lack of knowledge about job options, a report says.", "authors": ["Sean Coughlan", "Bbc News Family", "Education Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16AB4/production/_109225829_careers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
