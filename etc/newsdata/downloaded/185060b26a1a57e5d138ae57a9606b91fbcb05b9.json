Netflix and Amazon led an 87% increase in spend by overseas on-demand services from \u00a3150m in 2017 to nearly \u00a3300m, with Netflix in particular ramping up its rate of British-made shows.\n\nIn recent years Netflix and Amazon have emerged as major contributors to a domestic film and TV production industry whose main pillars were broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky, as well as the Hollywood film studios.\n\nThe spending boom from the two US tech giants has put the squeeze on the availability of studio space to shoot shows and films. In July, Netflix, which made more than 40 productions in the UK last year, including Top Boy, struck a deal to take over Shepperton Studios as a permanent production base to enable it to keep a smooth flow of TV shows and films.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Pact report highlights the popularity of British-made shows in international markets, including the BBC\u2019s Line of Duty.

ITV uses a former military airbase in Yorkshire to film the hit drama Victoria and a converted carpet warehouse in Neasden, north-west London, was used as the filming base for another ITV production, Mr Selfridge.\n\nA strategy of providing a continual pipeline of new content has fuelled the rapid growth of Netflix, which has 151 million global subscribers, with 11 million in the UK, and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, which has 85 million subscribers worldwide and more than 8 million in the UK.\n\nThe UK TV production sector is hoping for another fillip as Disney ramps up spending on programming for its new service, which includes the $100m Star Wars series The Mandalorian, which is to launch on 12 November.\n\nDisney is committing billions to make Disney+ a success in its effort to become a third global streaming giant alongside Netflix and Amazon, which will spend about a combined $20bn on making and licensing TV shows and films this year.\n\nThe Pact report also highlights the booming popularity of British-made shows in international markets as sales of programmes such as The Bodyguard, The Cry, Line of Duty and Peaky Blinders hit \u00a3214m.\n\nTotal international revenues, which include global programme sales as well as the money spent by overseas broadcasters making shows in the UK, hit a record \u00a3962m last year. International revenues have grown more than 90% since 2013.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\u201cThese figures show that there is a huge international market looking for quality British content,\u201d said Sara Geater, the chair of Pact.\n\nAmazon, which has produced UK hits including The Grand Tour, and Netflix have rapidly grown to account for 40% of the total \u00a3704m spent on UK commissions by all overseas broadcasters.\n\nAccording to Pact, the \u00a3280m spent by Netflix and Amazon last year is 12% of the total \u00a32.3bn spent on making shows using UK producers by domestic TV companies such as the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky, as well as international players. In 2017 the US streaming services accounted for 7% of total programme commissioning spend.", "description": "US tech giants\u2019 \u00a3280m outlay drives British production sector to record high in 2018", "authors": ["Mark Sweney"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af90bade5aadb2d1378890dd808b48ee454ec7d1/578_436_6964_4178/master/6964.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7f71389d3bfa6e7cee382aea235e4e7", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
