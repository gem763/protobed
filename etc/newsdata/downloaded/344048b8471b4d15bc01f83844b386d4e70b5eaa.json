They haven't said by how much and they haven't said how they're going to get there. So, you know, if this year when the price increase got them to the worst cash burn in the history of the company, 3.5 half billion, what's going to make it improve next year with loss of content and more intense competition? And the answer is maybe they don't have as much to spend on because they're losing Friends and The Office.\"\n\nHe tells FOX Business that Disney, Fox, NBC Universal and Warner Brothers account for 65 percent of all Netflix viewing hours. However, all of that content will disappear from the streaming service by the end of 2021, leaving a big hole to fill.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % DIS WALT DISNEY COMPANY 130.26 -0.63 -0.48% FOXA FOX CORP. 32.74 +0.53 +1.65% CMCSA COMCAST CORP. 46.08 +0.51 +1.12% T AT&T INC. 38.23 -0.24 -0.62%\n\nHe warns that the 262 half-hour episodes of Friends, or 130 hours of content, account for about 7 percent of total viewing hours on the platform that will disappear next year. In total, Netlfix will lose about 25 percent of all its views, according to Recode.\n\nIn order to fill that gap, Pachter says Netflix will have to make five times as many original shows, and even then the company\u2019s $200 billion valuation is in question.\n\n\u201cI think what they're going to do is print negative three point three billion this year and then print negative 3 billion next year and run a victory lap,\u201d Pachter said. \u201cExcept that blows a hole in everybody's valuation because people have it turning cash flow positive literally in two years.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBreak even in 10 years. How do you value this thing at $200 billion? You just can't. It doesn't make any sense at all.\u201d\n\nPachter is in the minority when it comes to being bearish on Netflix. Of the 44 analysts who cover the stock, 40 of them have a \u201chold\u201d rating or higher with an average price target of $362.05 a share.\n\nIn April, Netflix rolled out its latest price increase in an effort to help plug the hole left by its cash burn, which reached a record $3 billion in 2018. Netflix says that number will peak in 2020 before turning lower.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nLast week, the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results on revenue that matched expectations, causing analysts up and down Wall Street \u2013 but not Pachter \u2013 to raise their price targets.\n\n\u201cSo that's why I'm a bear because I went to business school at UCLA. We actually learned valuation on a DCF basis. I finished second in my class and I got one hundred in finance and I know how to do DCF in my head and obviously most of my competitors don't do a very good job in evaluating the company,\u201d Pachter said.\n\n\u201cSo all of them to a person are making stuff up as they go. And that's fair because we don't have visibility when this company turns positive and we're required by the regulators to have price targets so they slap big price targets on.\u201d\n\nBillionaire Barry Diller, chairman and senior executive of IAC and Expedia, may not be an analyst but he says no one can catch Netflix in the streaming space.\n\n\u201cDisney has such appealing content that I think they\u2019ll do well,\u201d he told FOX Business\u2019 \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d this month. \u201cWill they ever get to Netflix\u2019s size? I can\u2019t imagine it. It seems incomprehensible to me that that will happen.\u201d\n\nDiller points to Netflix\u2019s global footprint as a reason for his optimism.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s this company, not very well capitalized that starts in the streaming business and then makes such big bets that they change the entire entertainment business, change the 100-years-old hegemony of these major entertainment companies,\" Diller added.\n\n\u201cThat they\u2019ve done this and then they said right away we\u2019re going worldwide. So they planted their little flags in every place in the world years ago.\u201d\n\nBut in Pachter\u2019s mind, that is part of Netflix\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cAsk yourself how many companies, and I would tell you it's probably two, Coca-Cola and McDonald's, do business in 200 countries. So how many media companies do business in 200 countries? The answer is zero. Right. Why? Because it doesn't f**king make economic sense to be in Belarus and Gabon,\" he notes.\n\nBy comparison, Pachter said that Amazon Prime is in 16 countries and Prime Video in about 24.\n\n\u201cNetflix is doing it solely based on Reed Hastings\u2019 ego because he wanted to say he's in every country,\u201d Pachter said, adding that you can\u2019t make money making content for Estonia and Chechnya. Because of that, he doesn\u2019t think Netflix\u2019s international business will ever turn a profit.\n\nAs for when investors will finally wake up to the reality check that he says is coming to Netflix shareholders, Pachter thinks it will take two or three years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI honestly don't know when the credit markets are going to shut them down,\u201d he said. \u201cGod save them if they lose subscribers. God save them if Disney and Peacock and HBO Max and Apple TV+ are hugely successful. That comes at the expense of Netflix.\u201d\n\nNetflix shares have gained nearly 3 percent this year, trailing the S&P 500\u2019s 20 percent rise.", "description": "Netflix needs billions but the street is unfazed.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/RT-Reed-Hastings.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
