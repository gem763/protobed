Buyout firms also have large public market assets, which they are looking to sell off at a profit.\n\nBlackstone said its private equity portfolio appreciated 2.6% in the third quarter. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose by 3.8% and 2.3% respectively.\n\nThe firm raised a record $26 billion for its flagship buyout fund during the quarter, as it benefited from a strong fundraising environment driven by institutional investors seeking higher returns amid low interest rates.\n\nTotal assets under management rose to a $554 billion in the three months to September, up 2% from $545.5 billion in the prior quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "description": "Blackstone reported a drop in proceeds from asset sales in its private equity business, offset partly by a rise in distributable earnings in its real estate, corporate credit and hedge funds divisions.
