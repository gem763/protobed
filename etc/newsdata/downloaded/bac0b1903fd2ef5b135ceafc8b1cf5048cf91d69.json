(AP) - The analytics kept telling John Harbaugh to roll the dice on fourth down, or gamble for a 2-point conversion when the Baltimore Ravens finally hit pay dirt against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nNone of that number crunching paid off Sunday.\n\nThe fourth-down attempt near midfield was stuffed, and the Chiefs took advantage of the short field to strike quickly for a touchdown. And all three of those 2-point conversion attempts also came up empty - six points that would have covered the margin in a 33-28 defeat.\n\n\u201cWe had a mindset that we were going to come in and try to score as many points as we could. So, that\u2019s what we tried to do,\u201d Harbaugh explained. \u201cI know we all felt the same way. We\u2019re going to keep playing. We\u2019re going after it. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to play all year.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Harbaugh ever second-guessed himself, he replied: \u201cNo. We don\u2019t play scared.\u201d\n\nDespite the missed opportunities, the Ravens still nearly came back from a 30-13 fourth-quarter hole. Mark Ingram started the comeback with his third touchdown run - the 2-point conversion naturally failed - and Justin Tucker added a 39-yard field goal to make it 30-22 with 6:39 to go.\n\nHarrison Butker answered at the other end for Kansas City, making it a two-possession game, but the Ravens breezed 70 yards in just over 2 1/2 minutes to score again. Lamar Jackson capped the drive by scrambling to his right and beating the entire Kansas City defense to the pylon.\n\nOnce more, the Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, trying to get within a field goal should they get the ball back. And once more, the Chiefs\u2018 defense was up to the challenge, forcing Jackson out of bounds short of the pylon to preserve their 33-28 advantage.\n\nIt wound up being a moot point.\n\nThe Ravens tried to get the ball back with a rare dropkick, but Chiefs rookie Mecole Hardman calmly signaled for a fair catch. And when the Chiefs\u2018 Patrick Mahomes found backup running back Darrel Williams with a 16-yard screen pass on third-and-9 with 1:51 to go, that was it for Baltimore.\n\nMahomes kneeled twice more to run out the clock.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be aggressive. If those things would have went our way it would have been a little different,\u201d Ravens tight end Mark Andrews said. \u201cObviously they didn\u2019t go our way today and that\u2019s tough, but again, we\u2019ve got to execute better. I love the aggressive mindset.\u201d\n\nOne big reason for that approach had to do with the opposing offense.\n\nThe Chiefs rolled into the game having scored at least 26 points in an NFL record 23 straight games, and Mahomes has been building nicely on his MVP season through the first two weeks.\n\nSo even though the Chiefs were missing three starters on offense - wide receiver Tyreek Hill, running back Damien Williams and left tackle Eric Fisher - the Ravens figured they would still need to score every point they could to keep up.\n\n\u201cThe Chiefs have a great offense, an explosive offense,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cOur job is to finish and keep our defense off the field as much as we can. We didn\u2019t do that today.\u201d\n\nKansas City was ready for it, too.\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid had noticed the Ravens go for it on fourth down more than just about any team in the league, and they\u2019re just as aggressive when it comes to conversions. Jackson\u2019s uncanny ability to scramble away from the pocket for positive yards is a big reason for it.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that caught us by surprise. They love doing that,\u201d Reid said, \u201cand they have the firepower to do it. You have to be on your toes.\u201d\n\nTurned out the Chiefs were up to the task.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The analytics kept telling John Harbaugh to roll the dice on fourth down, or gamble for a 2-point conversion when the Baltimore Ravens finally hit pay dirt against the Kansas City Chiefs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/ravens_chiefs_football_02110_c0-125-3001-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f004afff785dabb7c63f295a05af776e2e42481e", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
