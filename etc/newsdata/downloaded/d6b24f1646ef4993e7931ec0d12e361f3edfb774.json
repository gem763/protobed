Japan's Nikkei slid 0.12%.\n\nThe pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down\n\n0.09%, German DAX futures were down 0.02%, while FTSE\n\nfutures fell 0.03%.\n\nAsian shares got off to a bright start after U.S. President\n\nDonald Trump said a deal to end a nearly 15-month trade war with\n\nChina \"could happen sooner\" that people think. However, the positive mood faded and Chinese shares\n\nfell 0.35% as Trump's repeated mixed messages about\n\ntrade negotiations caused investors to curb their enthusiasm.\n\nTreasury prices and gold rose in a sign that some investors\n\npreferred safe assets given lingering risks posed by trade\n\nfriction and political uncertainty.\n\n\"Trump is genuinely interested in reaching a trade agreement\n\nwith China, but he also trusts his advisers and when they tell\n\nhim what the Chinese are bringing to the table is insufficient,\n\nor has been dramatically altered at the last minute,\" Jeff M.\n\nSmith, Research Fellow at the South Asia-Heritage Foundation,\n\nsaid in the Global Markets Forum chatroom\n\n\"He's proven more than willing to walk away from a bad\n\ndeal.\"\n\nU.S. stock futures fell 0.18% on Thursday, following\n\na 0.62% increase in the S&P 500 on Wednesday.\n\nThe United States and China have been locked in a year-long\n\ndispute over Beijing's trade practices that has slowed global\n\ngrowth and increased the risk of recession for some economies.\n\nAnalysts tempered their optimism over a resolution to the\n\ntrade war because Trump's public comments often send mixed\n\nsignals.\n\nJust on Tuesday, Trump sharply criticised China in a speech\n\nat the United Nations General Assembly, where he said he would\n\nnot accept a \"bad deal\".\n\nTrump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed a\n\nlimited trade deal on Wednesday that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm\n\ngoods, Japanese machine tools and other products while further\n\nstaving off the threat of higher U.S. car duties. Japanese shares initially got a boost from the agreement but\n\nturned lower in volatile trade as investors squared positions\n\nbefore shares go ex-dividend from Friday.\n\n\n\nAustralian shares also fell 0.53% percent as\n\nscepticism about and end to the trade war set in.\n\nTreasury prices rose as investors sought safe-haven assets.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes\n\nfell to 1.7025%. The two-year yield fell to 1.6595%.\n\nSpot gold , another safe-haven, rose 0.31% to\n\n$1,508.52 per ounce. GOL/\n\nInvestors are largely shrugging off the Democrats' decision\n\nto begin an impeachment inquiry into Trump. The move came as a\n\nsummary of a telephone call showed the U.S. president had asked\n\nUkraine's president to investigate a political rival.\n\nCasting doubt over the likelihood of impeachment is the\n\nmajority held by Trump's Republicans in the Senate, which can be\n\nused to quash any attempt to remove the president from office.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 jumped 0.59% to $0.6305\n\nafter the head of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said\n\nunconventional monetary easing is unlikely as central banks\n\nponder how to contain risks posed by trade friction.\n\nU.S. crude fell 0.05% to $56.48 per barrel in another\n\nsign of investor concern about the global economy.\n\n\n\nJapan stocks: cheap and profitable https://tmsnrt.rs/2W6a7Fe\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Editing by Sam Holmes and Richard Borsuk; Editing by Stephen\n\nCoates)\n\n", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian stocks give up gains as U.S.-China optimism fades", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
