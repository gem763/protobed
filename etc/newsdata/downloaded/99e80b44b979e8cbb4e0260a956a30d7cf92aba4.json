You can subscribe to Underunderstood on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nA few months ago, I opened the Yelp app, typed in the name of my favorite sushi restaurant, and clicked on the phone number. Two options popped up: \u201cDelivery or Takeout\u201d and \u201cGeneral Questions.\"\n\nThat\u2019s new, I thought. I dialed the number for \u201cDelivery or Takeout,\u201d which played a perky greeting\u2014\u201cThis call may be recorded to ensure awesomeness\u201d\u2014before a woman at the restaurant picked up. I asked why they were recording the call for awesomeness; she had no idea what I was referring to. I asked about the number I had just dialed; she didn\u2019t recognize it.\n\n\u201cWhat number did I just call?\u201d I asked. She told me the number that was listed for \u201cGeneral Questions.\u201d Then she asked what I wanted to order.\n\nAs it turns out, the number listed for \u201cGeneral Questions\u201d in the Yelp app is the restaurant\u2019s real number. The number listed for \u201cDelivery or Takeout\u201d is owned by Yelp partner Grubhub.\n\nThe Yelp app lists a restaurant\u2019s direct phone number on the actual listing. That\u2019s (212) 262-8300 in the case of Judge Roy Bean Public House. But when you click on the phone number, this dialogue shows up: Delivery or Takeout and General Questions.\n\nWhen a user clicks on the \u201cCall\u201d button labeled \u201cDelivery or Takeout,\u201d they are taken to a different number, (646) 394-9837, which is owned by Grubhub.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cCall\u201d button next to \u201cGeneral Questions\u201d leads to the restaurant\u2019s real number.\n\n\n\nEven though restaurants are capable of taking orders directly\u2014after all, both numbers are routed to the same place\u2014Yelp is pushing customers to Grubhub-owned phone numbers in order to facilitate what Grubhub calls a \u201creferral fee\u201d of between 15 percent and 20 percent of the order total, I learned while researching an episode for the podcast Underunderstood.\n\nYelp has historically functioned like an enhanced Yellow Pages, listing direct phone numbers for restaurants along with photos, information about the space, menus, and user reviews. But Yelp began prompting customers to call Grubhub phone numbers in October 2018 after the two companies announced a \u201clong-term partnership.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair because this is our customer who called directly into our restaurant. It\u2019s a trick.\u201d\n\nRestaurant owners may not be aware of the change. Mohammad Zaman, an owner of Afghan Kabab and Grill House in Brooklyn, insisted the phone number that showed up in Yelp was a mistake until a call placed to the number rang at his desk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair because this is our customer who called directly into our restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trick.\u201d\n\nRobert Guarino, CEO of the Manhattan restaurant group 5 Napkin Burger and a board member at the New York City Hospitality Alliance, was also not aware that Grubhub numbers were showing up in Yelp for two of his four restaurants.\n\n\u201cWe're working with these companies to help generate orders, but so many times, we're put in a position where we need to compete against them to get access to our customers,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many of these practices make it hard to trust the companies. To not have all the practices clearly spoken about and understood by the businesses is really scary in my eyes.\u201d\n\nGrubhub offers a \u201cmarketing\u201d service to restaurants, which includes being listed on the Grubhub platform, for between 15 percent and 20 percent of each order total. It also offers a physical delivery service, which costs restaurants another 10 percent. Grubhub says it provides phone numbers for restaurants that sign up for marketing but not delivery in order to capture all orders that could be eligible for its fees.\n\n\u201cIt is our understanding that Grubhub has marketing agreements with some restaurants that allow Grubhub to utilize referral numbers on third party partner sites like Yelp,\u201d a spokesperson for Yelp said in an email. She deferred further questions to Grubhub.\n\n\"It is important to keep in mind that we are a marketing platform and, in almost all of these cases, the diner would not have discovered or placed an order with this restaurant without our platform,\u201d Brendan Lewis, a spokesperson for Grubhub, told me in an email. \u201cThe order is the result of our marketing efforts.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Grubhub is claiming that every phone call to a restaurant originating specifically from the Yelp app is attributable to Grubhub\u2019s marketing efforts. The Yelp website does not list referral numbers.\n\nBoth companies said they do not measure call volume. However, people have been using Yelp as a directory since long before it partnered with Grubhub. This suggests that Yelp may be driving callers to Grubhub rather than Grubhub\u2019s marketing efforts driving callers to Yelp and then to restaurants.\n\nGrubhub\u2019s CEO seemed to say as much in March 2018 when the two companies announced that customers could now order through Grubhub from within Yelp.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to complete our integration with Yelp, which enhances the online ordering experience for diners and will drive more orders to our restaurants from Yelp\u2019s tens of millions of monthly users,\u201d Matt Maloney, Grubhub\u2019s founder and chief executive officer, said in a press release at the time.\n\nThe average user may not understand how this works, either. In June, H. Claire Brown at The New Food Economy reported that the food delivery platform Grubhub has been creating thousands of websites in restaurants\u2019 names, sometimes surpassing the restaurant\u2019s own website in search engine visibility, in order to drive more online orders and commissions for Grubhub. The piece sparked a backlash from conscientious customers pledging to order directly in the future in order to protect their favorite restaurants\u2019 profits. Natt Garun, a Verge writer whose parents own a restaurant, wrote a guide to finding a restaurant\u2019s real contact information and avoid Grubhub\u2019s fees to businesses. This involves dodging Grubhub-owned properties (Seamless, AllMenus, LevelUp, Tapingo, MenuPages, and Eat24) as well as the Grubhub-created websites and the Yelp app.\n\nThe Yelp calls may also be concerning to restaurant owners because of the number of false positives generated by Grubhub\u2019s phone tracking system. Munish Narula, who owns restaurants in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, sued Grubhub in December 2018 for $5 million, claiming false charges for phone calls from customers asking questions and not actually ordering anything. The New York Post has also reported extensively on these false charges with a series of stories starting in May. One restaurant in New York negotiated a $10,000 refund for bogus charges, the Post reported, dating back to 2014.\n\nGrubhub says it analyzes the call recordings to determine if an order has actually been placed and censor personal information. The recording of a call that results in a charge is sent to the restaurant. Grubhub says it retains these recordings and uploads them to the private page that restaurants use to manage their service so that restaurants can audit them and dispute any errors. Grubhub says it does not use the recordings for any other purpose. Grubhub also says only 35 percent of calls placed through the numbers result in charges.\n\nThe call was a customer who had his restaurant confused with another restaurant. It took four minutes to figure this out before the customer hung up without placing an order. \u201cI got charged almost $8 for that phone call.\u201d\n\nThe commissions charged for phone orders are also frequently inaccurate because unlike with online orders, Grubhub does not actually know how much a phone order costs. It calculates its marketing commission based on the average of the last six non-phone orders.\n\nAndrew Martino, owner of the delivery and takeout-only restaurant Ghost Truck, only learned about the phone commissions in July when he was going over his books and realized he was off by a significant amount of money.\n\n\u201cI couldn't figure out what I was missing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe signed into his private Grubhub page where he noticed a few transactions with just a fee and no order total.\n\n\u201cThere's a button where you could hit play and so I was like, what is this?\u201d he said. \u201cI hit play, and the first call was me on the phone, which freaked me out because I didn't know I was being recorded.\u201d The call was a customer who had his restaurant confused with another restaurant. It took four minutes to figure this out before the customer hung up without placing an order. \u201cI got charged almost $8 for that phone call.\u201d\n\nI reviewed some of the recordings for Ghost Truck Kitchen and found multiple false positives, where Grubhub charged the restaurant between $7.80 and $7.92 per call for informational phone calls that did not result in an order.\n\nMost recordings beeped out identifying information, but one recording included an address and full name that were not censored.\n\nRestaurants are becoming increasingly vocal about the financial pressures they feel from high fees on online ordering apps. New York City council member Mark Gjonaj, head of the Committee on Small Business, held a hearing in June where restaurant owners testified beside representatives from Grubhub and UberEats.\n\nGrubhub representatives said that it is only driving incremental orders, meaning they are orders that come in on top of whatever business the restaurant was already doing. They also said that Grubhub takes professional photos, increases average order sizes, and gives businesses data-driven advice.\n\n\u201cThere is a restaurant on the Upper East Side that serves sushi. We worked with them and we said that there's a trend for poke bowls. We suggested that they start adding some of these items to their menu,\u201d Grubhub senior vice president Kevin Kearns said at the hearing. \u201cThey did this and within one month, they doubled their orders, and within three months they 7x\u2019ed their orders to 1,600 orders a month. This is a small business that went all the way up to 1,600 orders a month, and they actually changed the name of the restaurant to put poke in their name because it works so well.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Gjonaj asked the state Attorney General to investigate Grubhub for antitrust violations and Senator Chuck Schumer threatened to recommend that the Federal Trade Commission investigate Grubhub if the company did not refund restaurants for erroneous fees.\n\nI asked Grubhub if there was any movement to revisit the way it handles referrals based on the backlash to the news reports and in the City Council hearing. \u201cWe have never abused the trust of our restaurant partners or built our business through trickery and fraud,\u201d Lewis wrote in an email. \u201cThrough Seamless\u201d\u2014which Grubhub merged with in 2013\u2014\u201cwe have supported restaurants in NYC for over 20 years, driven billions of dollars in food sales for them, managed millions of care issues on their behalf and institutionalized takeout as a fundamental core of eating in New York.\u201d\n\nGrubhub did make one change in response to public pressure. It extended the window in which restaurants can dispute erroneous charges from 60 days to 120 days, the Post reported.\n\nMartino, the owner of Ghost Truck Kitchen, complained to Grubhub about his erroneous phone charges. The company agreed to stop charging him for phone commissions unless a call was over 800 seconds, \u201cwhich is great,\u201d he said, but \u201calso makes you think they know they're doing something wrong.\u201d\n\nMartino gets about 50 percent of his sales through Grubhub. However, he\u2019s hoping to get that percentage down. He now takes orders online himself through his website and encourages customers to order there or through his direct phone number. \u201cI definitely implore people to forgo the three seconds of convenience to help neighborhood businesses,\u201d he said.", "description": "The phone numbers add tracking before connecting to a restaurant so that Grubhub can bill for a marketing fee.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d48a753c0405600087e1707/lede/1565043688712-GettyImages-517456334.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8269xh;0xw,0.1731xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-08-06"}
