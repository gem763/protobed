He continued, \"Everything that she went through and what happened to her is incredibly raw, every single day, and that's not me being paranoid. That's just me not wanting a repeat of the past. And if anybody else knew what I knew, be it a father, be it husband, be it anyone, you'd probably be doing exactly what I'm doing as well.\"\n\nHarry explained that the pressure from the media requires constant management. \"Part of this job and part of any job, like everybody, means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of this stuff. But again, for me, and for my wife, you know, of course there's a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue. But all we need to do is focus on being real and focus on being the people that we are, and standing up for what we believe in. I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mom,\" said Harry.\n\nOn the penultimate day of Harry and Meghan's tour, Bradby got some one-on-one time with Meghan, who confirmed that she's struggled under the royal scrutiny. \"Any woman, especially when they're pregnant, you're really vulnerable. So, that was made really challenging,\" Meghan explained. \"Especially as a woman it's really, it's a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed.\" Meghan then thanked Bradby for asking how she's been doing.\n\n\"Thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I'm okay, but it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,\" said Meghan.\n\nViewers took to Twitter in full support of the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nUgh I love Meghan and don\u2019t fully understand how people can be so critical. She\u2019s such a class act and a beautiful representation of our country. New wife! New mom! New family! New role! New home! Y\u2019all. That\u2019s SO much. #HarryAndMeghan pic.twitter.com/DFaZqu51Ue \u2014 Emily Rau (@emilyrau) October 24, 2019\n\nMeghan, your American sisters stand with you. \u270c\ud83d\udc93 #HarryAndMeghan \u2014 Maridee Now (@marideenow) October 24, 2019\n\nWatching #HarryAndMeghan and wonder how humans can be so unkind. Already, I am tearing seeing the incredible people they met and made feel wonderful. Let them do great things and love each other and their children. They have good hearts and will make the world better. \u2014 tracey spiegelman (@tspiegy) October 24, 2019\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel any sympathy for Meghan Markle after that interview, I suggest you go check if you still have a pulse.\n\n\n\nIt even baffles me, as a born and bred British man, that so many British people can be so unabashedly cruel and vindictive. #HarryandMeghan \u2014 Piquant (@piquancy_) October 20, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s a thought - if you\u2019re buying these gossip magazines you\u2019re also responsible for making #HarryAndMeghan miserable.\n\n\n\nFind a hobby!! pic.twitter.com/dx4EJFy0FO \u2014 SAM6 (@travelong6) October 24, 2019\n\nI want to wrap her in an American flag and kick the British tabloids in the teeth. So glad she has Harry by her side and sweet Archie. #HarryAndMeghan pic.twitter.com/JhEDzzJKul \u2014 Katie Speake (@katie_speake) October 24, 2019\n\nBradby concluded his interview asking Meghan if she can \"put up with this and what happens if\" she can't. Meghan responded, \"It's not enough to just survive something, right? That's not the point of life. You've got to thrive, you've got to feel happy and I think I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried. I really tried. But I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.\"\n\nMeghan also explained that the hardest part of all the media scrutiny is that it's \"just untrue.\"\n\n\"The biggest thing that I know is that I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair, and that's the part that's really hard to reconcile,\" shared Meghan.\n\nHarry & Meghan: An African Journey aired on Wednesday, Oct. 23 at 10 p.m. on ABC.\n\nCheck out Gwen Stefani and Kelly Clarkson being brought to tears over emotional night on \u2018The Voice\u2019:\n\nRead more from Yahoo!
