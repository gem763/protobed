When his buggy was full, he took off at a trot, sometimes speeding up to a canter. The riders paid about 50 cents for a 10-minute ride, a fraction of what it would cost to take a taxi.", "description": "Horse-drawn carts are a staple means of transportation in Dakar, the booming capital of Senegal.
