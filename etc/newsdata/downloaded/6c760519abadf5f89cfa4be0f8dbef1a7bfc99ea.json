The company said in September the CBD-based treatment significantly reduced seizures, with frequency reduced by a median of more than 44% after two months.\n\nNow the company is testing of its cannabis-based treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders in what's called the Bright Trial, with topline results expected early next year.\n\nAnother trial of Zygel, Inspire, is testing the treatment on behavioral and emotional symptoms of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.\n\n\u201cSo it's stacking up to be a really interesting first half of the year,\u201d said Zynerba vice president Will Roberts.\n\nDNA Genetics: Selling Experience\n\nAs the cannabis industry has worked hard to gain respectability, DNA Genetics doesn\u2019t want to forget about what made cannabis popular for years before:\n\n\u201cMind-blowing experience,\u201d said CEO Charles Phillips. \"That\u2019s what we want to give people.\"\n\nIt's a variation on the way the experience has been enjoyed for hundreds of years, he said.\n\nThe company, which began as a seed store and has grown into one of the top strain providers in the business, does genetic selection, breeding and cultivation.\n\nDNA Genetics is focused on the plant, Phillips said.\n\n\u201cThe highest-selling category in California is not vapes, not edibles, it\u2019s flower,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we do.\u201d\n\nHempFusion's Go-Public Plan\n\nHempFusion is on track for a Canadian IPO, potentially in the first quarter, said Jason Mitchell, president and co-founder of the Boulder, Colorado-based hemp products company.\n\nMitchell, a naturopath, said its products stand out because of its organic hemp and its focus on the value of the whole plant, rather than just specific molecules.\n\n\u201cWe look at it from a whole food perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company plans to expand distribution to the United Kingdom before the end of the year and also is considering selling in Ireland, the company president said.\n\nCalyx Peak: Coming To Your Door?\n\nThe cannabis retail industry will soon follow broader trends in consumer product sales, said Ed Schmults, CEO of Calyx Peak Companies.\n\n\u201cHome delivery is coming,\u201d Schmults said. \u201cSo is e-commerce, but e-commerce will take a while,\" he said, though the company doesn't have any specific announcements about either space.\n\nCalyx Peak, a multistate operator focused mostly in California, Massachusetts and Ohio, will likely be profitable sometime in the first half of next year, the CEO said.\n\nGive Vapen Some Likes \u2014 And Some Love In The Comments\n\nVapen MJ Ventures executives want their friends to use their product cannabis products. And if they\u2019re famous, they want them to put something on Instagram about it.\n\nVapen has gotten a lot of traction from the low-cost use of celebrity influencers to boost awareness of its products, said company president and CEO Bob Brilon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about paying these guys $1 million to post for us. It happens because of friends of friends,\u201d he said.\n\nThe biggest hit in the social media space came when the company took some of its swag to a Cardi B music video shoot and she did a video for Vapen wearing the company\u2019s merchandise. A social media post got over 100 million views, Brilon said. \u201cThose are things you just can\u2019t pay for. They have millions of followers.\u201d\n\nStem Holdings Introducing New Products in Nevada\n\nStem Holdings Inc. (OTC: STMH) is introducing its Travis x James cannabis flower brand and its Cannavore edibles brand to Nevada, said CEO Adam Berk.\n\nStem already has a cultivation facility in the Las Vegas area.\n\nThe company is in expansion mode, Berk said, with a focus on building out another new cultivation facility in Oregon and expansion into more new states and \"potentially international markets\" on the horizon.\n\n\"We'll exceed $40 million in revenue during the next 12 months,\" he said.\n\nRelated Links:\n\n'I'm On A Mission From God': Jim Belushi On Cannabis Cultivation, Celebrity Brands, The 'Marriage Counselor' Strain\n\nNew Frontier Data COO: Cannabis Companies Need 'Real Reasons' For Mergers\n\nPhoto courtesy of Stem Holdings.\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
