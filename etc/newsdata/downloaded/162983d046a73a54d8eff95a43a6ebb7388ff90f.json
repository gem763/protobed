I feature an armed citizen story, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t get a chance to do today\u2019s Bearing Arms\u2019 Cam & Co. because of construction near my studio. I did offer up a baby goat video on Twitter to make up for the lack of a new show, but I think you deserve a little more.\n\nDue to unforeseen circumstances, there won\u2019t be a new Bearing Arms\u2019 @CamAndCompany today. Here\u2019s a baby goat video as a token of my regret. pic.twitter.com/TpIJBWsXLg \u2014 Cam Edwards (@CamEdwards) October 17, 2019\n\nI realize that you\u2019re not here for the baby goat videos (or at least you weren\u2019t until now), so I\u2019ve also got several armed citizens to share with you as a peace offering for not delivering a fresh Cam & Co. today, starting with this story from Las Vegas.\n\nLas Vegas police believe a man was acting in self-defense Monday night when he shot his girlfriend\u2019s ex-boyfriend inside an east Las Vegas apartment. About 7:15 p.m., a woman and her boyfriend were inside an apartment on the 1400 block of North Sandhill Road when the woman\u2019s former boyfriend tried to kick the door in, prompting the current boyfriend to open fire, according to Metropolitan Police Department Lt. David Gordon.\n\nThe ex-boyfriend took off, but police found him a few doors away with multiple gunshot wounds. He was taken to a local hospital, and according to last reports is expected to survive. The investigation is ongoing, but at the moment it looks like a case of self-defense and defense of another.\n\nThen we have this story from Franklin, Kentucky, where a store owner used his own gun to put a scare into a robber wearing a Halloween mask.\n\nOn October 16, 2019 at 6:52 PM, these two subjects committed an attempted armed robbery at Bluegrass Cellular located on\u2026 Posted by Franklin Police Department, KY on Thursday, October 17, 2019\n\nI can\u2019t help but think that robber\u2019s face probably looked a lot like the mask he was wearing when he saw the store owner had a gun of his own.\n\nIn Davidson County, North Carolina, an employee of the \u201cThe Little Fish House\u201d ended up thwarting an armed robbery on Wednesday morning.\n\nInvestigators learned that an attempted robber tried to get into the business, but, when they were not allowed to get in, the robber pulled out a gun and allegedly shot into the business. An employee fired back. Deputies do not know if the robber was hit. The sheriff\u2019s office is reviewing surveillance video which deputies say they are certain will lead to charges and an arrest.\n\nFinally, we have a story out of Florence, Alabama, where a man is no longer facing murder charges in a 2018 shooting after a judge acknowledged it was a case of self-defense.\n\nAccording to court documents, Marcus Jermaine Weakley has been granted immunity from the charges under state law self-defense laws. Weakley was arrested on June 10, 2018, in connection with the shooting death of Patton Shipley, and turned himself in after a Lauderdale County grand jury indicted him in August 2018. Circuit judge Will Powell stated in the order of dismissal, Marcus Weakley was justified when using deadly physical force when he shot and killed Patton Shipley in June of 2018.\n\nAll four of these self-defense cases barely made the local news, much less got any national headlines. And yet stories like these do happen every day across the United States. Gun owners really do protect themselves and others with their firearms, the right of self-defense is exercised, and lives are saved. I feature an armed citizen story on every episode of Bearing Arms\u2019 Cam & Co., but I\u2019m going to start featuring more armed citizen stories in roundups like this one. I hope you\u2019ll share this and other armed citizen stories on your social media platforms so we can help get the word out about these underreported but awfully important acts of self-defense.", "description": "The national media has no real desire to cover armed citizen stories, but they're ignoring some amazing and compelling recent cases of self-defense.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/3b03351f-5259-4939-8fec-06a9c908670b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
