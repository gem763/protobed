Sad to say,\" Pelosi told reporters outside the White House with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nSchumer said the dramatic moment unfolded after Trump referred to Pelosi as a \"third-rate politician.\"\n\nThe meeting was about the president's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, paving the way for Turkey to invade the area. Ahead of the meeting, the House overwhelmingly voted in favor of a resolution rebuking the Trump's decision to pull troops out.\n\n\"I think that vote, the size of the vote \u2014 more than 2 to 1 of the Republicans voted to oppose what the president did \u2014 it probably got to the president, because he was shaken up by it,\" Pelosi said. \"That's why we couldn't continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it.\"", "description": "Chuck Schumer said the dramatic moment unfolded after Trump referred to Pelosi as a \"third-rate politician.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4238894/1000x563_nbc-191016-pelosi-schumer-hoyer-ew-424p_b1248217b6c36d0398a0df3005ddc161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
