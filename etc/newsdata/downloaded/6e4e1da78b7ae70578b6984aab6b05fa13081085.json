Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said on Monday that the rules which allowed Sacoolas to leave the country were being looked at.\n\n\u201cI have already commissioned a review of the immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at Croughton,\u201d Raab told the House of Commons, adding that he does not believe that the current rules are \u201cright\u201d and that the review process will look at how to avoid having them be used in such a way again.\n\nForeign office admits DID know that Anne Sacoolas was about to leave the country, then advised police to tell the family \u2018a day or two\u2019 after they knew she had fled, but police left it another 11 days. Raab orders enquiry. It has taken a long time for them to admit that. \u2014 Dominic Waghorn (@DominicWaghorn) October 21, 2019\n\nUS officials actually warned their British counterparts that Sacoolas would leave the UK following the fatal incident, but the British were legally unable to prevent her departure, Raab said.\n\nDunn\u2019s family have since pressured police and the courts to continue their investigation, and possibly extradite Sacoolas to face charges. Though Sacoolas claimed immunity due to her husband\u2019s position at RAF Croughton, he has since left the base, and the Crown Prosecution Office stated that Sacoolas\u2019 immunity from prosecution no longer applies.\n\nAlso on rt.com BoJo slams Washington for protecting US diplomat\u2019s wife connected to death of British teenager\n\nFamily lawyer Raad Seiger urged the CPS to make a quick decision on filling an extradition request with US authorities.\n\n\u201cThat would be one giant step towards achieving closure,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cIt's not a game \u2013 this family are grieving.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has raised the question of sending Sacoolas back to the UK with the White House.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
