The protests were sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, though their demands reach deeper.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s defense of the semi-autonomous city went further than Mr. Trump has been willing to go in his rhetoric.\n\nMr. Trump has called for a \u201chumane\u201d solution to the Hong Kong situation and mixed support for the protesters with praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping. He says the Communist leader is a capable man who could sort out the situation by meeting with protest leaders.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
