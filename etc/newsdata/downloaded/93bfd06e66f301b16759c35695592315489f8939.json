Elizabeth Warren raked in $24.6 million during the July-September fundraising quarter, blowing past former Vice President Joe Biden and coming close to Sen. Bernie Sanders' field-leading haul.\n\nThe figure affirms the momentum Warren has appeared to be gaining in recent weeks and months, as polls show her now battling Biden \u2013 once the unrivaled front-runner \u2013 for the primary lead.\n\nWhile Sanders remains in third position in many polls, his fundraising is unmatched, totaling $25.3 million in the third quarter.\n\nBIDEN RAISES $15.2 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER, DOWN $6 MILLION FROM APRIL-JUNE HAUL\n\nBut Warren's campaign cash number comes close \u2014 and is far ahead of the $15.2 million raised by Biden in the last quarter.\n\nWarren and Biden are essentially tied for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator, who who\u2019s produced one progressive policy proposal after another, announced her fundraising figures on Twitter, saying, \u201cI\u2019m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019re building a movement that\u2019s going to put power back in the hands of the people,\u201d she pledged.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nWarren\u2019s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter.\n\nHer campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than half a million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.\n\nBest-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.\n\nAsked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if she reaches the general election, Warren touted her \"grassroots movement\" and highlighted \"that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.\"\n\nTuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nCampaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate\u2019s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign\u2019s strength. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel and ads.\n\nFox News' Tara Prindiville contributed to this report.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
