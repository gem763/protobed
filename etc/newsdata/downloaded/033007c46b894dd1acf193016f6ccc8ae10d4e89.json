What is a tariff and how do they work? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nMy relatives on our family farm in Indiana face another nervous growing season if China waits out Donald Trump on trade until after the 2020 election.\n\nThe tiny soybean, grown on my family farm back in Indiana, has become the raison d'\u00eatre for much of the trade dispute between the United States and China. According to President Donald Trump, China had agreed earlier this summer to reverse course and increase its purchases of soybeans and pork. However, in July, China concluded that the cost was prohibitive \u2014 in part because of a strong dollar \u2014 and once again reversed its planned soybean and pork purchases.\n\nThat set off a flurry of action and retaliation, with Trump announcing new tariffs set to take effect over Labor Day weekend and China imposing its own additional tariffs on $75 billion worth of American goods, including soybeans, auto parts and cars. Trump then said he would raise the rate of existing and planned tariffs by an additional 5 percentage points.\n\nAnd December looms large, with Chinese countermeasures set to take effect along with new 10% U.S. tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese shipments.\n\nWhen does this tit for tat ever end? Or does it?\n\nChina is more patient than America\n\nClearly, China engages in unfair trade and investment practices, preventing U.S. companies from competing on a level playing field and hurting U.S. workers, and the administration is correct to press for solutions to these long-standing issues while also de-escalating economic tensions and removing broad unilateral tariffs.\n\nBut like two heavyweight boxers, the fight seems destined to last the full 15 rounds with no knockout and no winner in sight. The Chinese government appears in fact willing to go into extended rounds and wait out Trump until after next year\u2019s elections. While the president's patience is clearly limited by that election calendar, the Chinese have a maxim that \u201cwith time and patience, the mulberry leaf becomes a silk gown.\u201d\n\nSoybean field at Hoagland family farm near Covington, Indiana. (Photo: Family photo)\n\nSince this trade dispute began in mid-2018, the U.S. trade deficit has generally increased, and U.S. economic activity has suffered.\n\nThe balance of trade between goods and services exported versus imported in 2017\u2014 the first year of the Trump administration \u2014 stood at a deficit of $550 billion. The negative impact of this trade deficit was to subtract 0.28 percentage points from the country\u2019s economic growth. (Growth was 2.4% in 2017.) By 2018, the trade deficit reached nearly $630 billion while subtracting 0.29 percentage points from growth that year. (Growth was 2.9% in 2018).\n\nNegative impact has doubled\n\nMore startling, the latest statistics from the Commerce Department indicate that for the second quarter of 2019, the trade imbalance has subtracted 0.65 percentage points from U.S. economic growth \u2014 resulting in an anemic 2.1% growth this most recent quarter. In other words, since this war has escalated, its negative impact on growth has doubled from 0.29 percentage points to 0.65 percentage points.\n\nChina\u2019s economy, always hard to measure, would also appear to not be benefiting from the boxing match, with a slowing economy and increasing unemployment. But a state-run centralized economy, with a president elected \u201cfor life,\u201d is better suited to weather the blows of this fight for the 14 months until Election Day 2020.\n\nMy relatives are struggling: I got an earful about Trump's trade war at my farm family reunion in Indiana\n\nUnfortunately, waiting 14 months means another nervous growing season in the heartland.\n\nOn visiting my family's farm recently, I found lush green fields of corn and soybeans. But on closer examination, because record wet weather forced late planting, immaturity of the soybean crop was prevalent in many of those otherwise lush green fields. Simple supply and demand would suggest that reduced production means higher prices this fall. But the other side of the equation is demand, and this is where the China dispute hurts hard.\n\nAgriculture trade used to run a surplus\n\nIn 2017, before the tariff dispute began, the United States exported $12.2 billion in soybeans to China. In 2018, that number declined nearly 75% to just $3.1 billion.Through the first six months of 2019, U.S. soybean exports to China totaled only $2.9 billion.\n\nGOP Rep. Will Hurd: It's not realistic to cut US-China economic ties. We should compete and win instead.\n\nGlobal trade is the economic engine of U.S. agriculture and rural America. Historically, U.S. agriculture trade has run a surplus to offset the greater U.S. trade deficit. But beginning in 2017, that trend reversed. By last year the surplus had evaporated, in part due to the trade war, and by some measures it\u2019s now a deficit.\n\nThe negative impacts of this dispute, along with diminished harvests this year, are having an impact on rural America. More than 240 Midwestern farms have already filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy over the past year, and more are struggling to make loan payments. Farmers are patient \u2014 they have to be. But I am sure they do not want to wait another 14 months or more before this dispute is resolved.\n\nG.
