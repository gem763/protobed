He was cleared before Sunday\u2019s game at the Giants, apparently a fantasy green light. But Johnson wound up with just one touch in the contest, while understudy Chase Edmonds went bonkers (150 total yards, three touchdowns).\n\nSo score one for playing it safe, right?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nChase Edmonds spent much of Sunday celebrating, along with his fantasy managers. (Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBut then we have the case of the Green Bay passing game. Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Geronimo Allison were out of practice all week and seemed unlikely to play against Oakland. Alas, they were both given the go-ahead Sunday against Oakland. Did you have the nerve to start either one of them? Did you move off presumed WR pivot Allen Lazard? And were you afraid to use name-brand quarterback Aaron Rodgers, given the questionable state of his receivers?\n\nTo be fair, Green Bay didn\u2019t focus on any specific downfield option in the 42-24 thrashing of Oakland. No one had more than five targets. But MVS had a 74-yard touchdown jaunt in the second half, justifying his fantasy spot. Meanwhile, Lazard (3-42-0, one drop) and Allison (4-33-0) were quiet.\n\nThe big Packers takeaway was the undeniable brilliance of Rodgers, who rang up six total touchdowns (five by air, one by land) without star receiver Davante Adams. No referee controversy in this one. No whispers of Rodgers being compromised. He only threw six incompletions in 31 attempts, didn\u2019t turn the ball over, only took one sack. That\u2019s a perfect game, kids. This was a clinic.\n\nStory continues\n\nImagine what Rodgers could do with a healthy Adams. Rodgers should be a fun play next week against Kansas City\u2019s spotty defense \u2014 a shame it\u2019s Matt Moore on the other side of things \u2014 and I can\u2019t imagine the Chargers will hold Rodgers back in Week 9. It\u2019s been a deliberate road at times, but Rodgers and Matt LaFleur are starting to make beautiful music together.\n\nMeanwhile, Edmonds was so dynamic in Arizona\u2019s 27-24 victory at the Giants, we have to wonder if Arizona\u2019s backfield is now a two-man show. Edmonds\u2019s efficiency stats were much better than Johnson\u2019s coming into this week, and while those stats can be misleading \u2014 Johnson normally has to deal with the burden of heavy volume and fresher defense \u2014 perhaps there\u2019s something to be said for using a running back with five years of fresher legs. The kid is alright.\n\nMaybe the Edmonds genie isn\u2019t going back into the bottle. He\u2019s now scored touchdowns in three straight games, he\u2019s dynamic in space, and he\u2019s averaging over six yards per touch. So many of his runs advance to the second level before anyone gets a real angle on him. The Cardinals have difficult draws the next two weeks (at New Orleans; home against San Francisco), but Edmonds at minimum is going to get flex consideration from me. Maybe he\u2019s better than that, perhaps a top 20 back going forward, no matter the context. We\u2019ll see what the tape and stat analysis bring over the next 48 hours; that\u2019s how the sausage is made.\n\nWhat if the Rams backfield has no right answers?\n\nAlthough the Rams put up 37 points at Atlanta, it wasn\u2019t the fantasy elixir many expected. None of the wideouts were able to score a touchdown. Jared Goff bogarted one rushing touchdown, and his two passing scores went to surprising options (Gerald Everett, Todd Gurley).\n\nAnd maybe there\u2019s no right answer in the Los Angeles backfield this year. Gurley stumbled to 2.3 a carry, while Darrell Henderson was nothing special (11-31-0). The offensive line has taken a step back. There was a time any back getting volume in this offense was an automatic fantasy start \u2014 heck, often a DFS staple. That\u2019s not the case at the moment.\n\nGurley\u2019s fantasy owners appreciate the touchdown deodorant, but given the attrition he\u2019s dealt with \u2014 dating back to his days at Georgia \u2014 he\u2019s the oldest 25-year-old in the league.\n\nQuick Hitters\n\n\u2022 Devin Singletary clearly has a bright future, but the Bills are in no hurry to get there. The LeSean McCoy cut has been misinterpreted in some circles; it clearly signified Singletary had a role with this team, but it didn\u2019t mean a featured role would be fast-tracked. He\u2019s still the clear secondary option, behind Frank Gore. And Josh Allen is always a mouth to feed in this rushing game, too.\n\n\u2022 I wouldn\u2019t say Ryan Tannehill was great, but he was certainly good enough. He threw into some tight windows, throws that Marcus Mariota generally won\u2019t attempt. Corey Davis had a useful game, and Adam Humphries chipped in. No one is going to miss Mariota.\n\nIf the Chargers were a funeral parlor, no one would die. \u2014 scott pianowski (@scott_pianowski) October 20, 2019\n\n\u2022 I\u2019ve always been a big fan of Kyle Shanahan, and the Niners defense is a nasty unit. But if San Francisco is going to be a true Super Bowl contender, it needs a second offensive playmaker after George Kittle, and better play from Jimmy Garoppolo. Sunday\u2019s uneven effort would not be good enough against a contending team. Garoppolo looked like he\u2019d never seen rain before.\n\n\u2022 Gardner Minshew is far from a finished product, but at least he has a chance. He\u2019s poised. He looks to press the ball downfield. He\u2019s shown the ability to learn from mistakes. And he\u2019s making weekly stars out of some of his receivers, something Blake Bortles rarely accomplished. As much as I love Nick Foles, I don\u2019t see any point to shift back to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Leonard Fournette is one of the quiet fantasy staples of the year. He has an extremely high touch floor, in part because of his quiet contributions in the passing game. He\u2019s been unlucky in the touchdown column; that\u2019s a sure bet to turn around. I\u2019d have no problem paying market for Fournette in a trade.\n\n\u2022 Once again, the Raiders overfed their primary skill guys. I still see Oakland as a losing team, but Josh Jacobs and Darren Weller are high-floor fantasy options. But Derek Carr? He\u2019s just good enough to lose with.\n\n\u2022 Why can\u2019t the Colts be the AFC\u2019s second-best team? They\u2019ve won at Kansas City. The victory over Houston was clean. They\u2019re deep, well coached, multiple. And these guys can also take a punch; even when a negative play hits, they just shake it off and go to the next snap. Frank Reich\u2019s personality is all over this roster.\n\n\u2022 I just want to see Kenny Stills stay healthy for a full season. There\u2019s no reason why he couldn\u2019t be WR25 or better.\n\nSterling Sharpe. Jerry Rice. Marvin Jones. Your list of wideouts with two four-touchdown games. \u2014 scott pianowski (@scott_pianowski) October 20, 2019\n\n\u2022 Lamar Jackson is undeniably electrifying, but there\u2019s also a recklessness to his game that concerns me. I find myself afraid something bad is going to happen at the conclusion of each play. I\u2019d like to see more polish in the pocket, too.\n\n\u2022 Allen Robinson is the only playable thing in Chicago. Mitch Trubisky would probably be in trouble if the team had anything of note behind him. Too often, Matt Nagy is too cute for his own good. Stop trying to make everything on the menu, find 2-4 dishes you can replicate consistently.\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Chase Edmonds and Aaron Rodgers went bonkers on Sunday, despite injury news that might have discouraged you from using them.
