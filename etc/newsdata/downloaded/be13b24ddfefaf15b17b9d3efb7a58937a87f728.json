It takes the form of a vote every four years with a simple majority to win.\n\nBut the DUP wanted any vote to be subject to the 'cross-community support' provision of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThis arrangement from 1998 means that contentious issues have to be approved by a majority of both unionists and nationalist politicians - giving them a powerful veto.\n\nThe DUP spokesman said: 'While some progress has been made in recognising the issue of consent, the elected representatives of Northern Ireland will have no say on whether Northern Ireland should enter these arrangements.\n\n'The Government has departed from the principle that these arrangements must be subject to the consent of both unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland.\n\n'These arrangements would be subject to a rolling review but again the principles of the Belfast Agreement on consent have been abandoned in favour of majority rule on this single issue alone.\n\n'These arrangements will become the settled position in these areas for Northern Ireland. This drives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast Agreement.'", "description": "Arlene Foster's hardline loyalists said that the agreement with Brussels\u00a0undermine the integrity of the Union after the PM revealed that an 11th hour compromise had been reached.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/13/19835922-0-image-a-4_1571314892770.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
