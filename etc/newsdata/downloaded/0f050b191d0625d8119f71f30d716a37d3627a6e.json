The device will be available starting early next month\n\nThis auxiliary screen, an OLED display that spans 6.1 inches, can lock at any angle and can be used as a keyboard, a kind of multi-tasking tool - think attaching a second display to one's computer - or as a game controller.\n\nUnlike other new innovative display technologies like an upcoming crop of foldable devices by Samsung and Huawei, the ThinQ's second display isn't a seamless extension of its primary screen.\n\nInstead, the accessory, when attached to the phone, is separated from the primary display by a center hinge and folds over like a clam shell to turn into the case.\n\nWhile the attachable display will come bundled with the phone for a limited period of time, using the accessory will come at a cost, at least to one's battery life.\n\nAccording to PC Mag, using the additional screen decreases the device's battery life by as much as 30 percent.\n\nLG will enter an increasingly crowded market for phones that have unique displays that include Samsung's Galaxy Fold and Huawei's Mate X\n\nGALAXY FOLD SPECS Starts at $1,980 7.3-inch main display with Infinity Flex technology 4.6-inch outer display when folded 512 gb of Universal Flash Storage 3.0 7 nanometer processor 12gb of RAM Three rear-facing cameras Two front-facing cameras on main display, one camera when folded 'App continuity' technology to run three apps at once Comes in cosmic Black, Martian Green, Astro Blue and Space Silver\n\nLG says the ThinQ will be released on November 1 for customers who use AT&T and will also be available for Sprint users on November 8.\n\nThe ThinQ will add to a growing array of devices that offer unique styles of display, including a tandem of folding phones from Samsung and Huawei.\n\nBoth the Samsung Galaxy Fold and Huawei's Mate X are already available to customers in markets across the world and tout a single display that can be folded out or on top of itself to give users different configuration modes.\n\nThose devices, however, are much pricier than LG's current offering, with the Fold retailing at $1,980 and the Mate X at $2,400.", "description": "The second screen, an 6.1 inch OLED display, can lock at any angle and can be used as a keyboard, a kind of multi-tasking tool - think attaching a second display to one's computer - or as a game controller.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/19/20341638-0-image-a-22_1572376066771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
