Vanacker said its results will not be consolidated going forward.\n\nEarlier this week Nynas said it will suspend imports of Venezuelan crude following changes to a license allowing it to operate under U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe continue to focus on the viability of Nynas,\u201d Vanacker said.\n\nNynas operates specialty refineries in Sweden, Germany and England, mostly for asphalt production.\n\nNeste will implement a scheduled 11-week major turnaround at its Porvoo refinery \u2014 the largest ever for the company \u2014 in the second quarter of 2020 that is expected to hit its renewable unit\u2019s operating profit by some 40 million euros.", "description": "Neste reported its highest ever quarterly profit on Wednesday as renewable products helped the Finnish oil refiner and biofuel producer beat forecasts.", "authors": ["Tarmo Virki", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444095863&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M11Z", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
