They include RTD, the Denver Zoo, the Museum of Nature and Science and other organizations.\n\nThe special session will address an \u201cunintended consequence from the passage of Senate Bill 17-267, and will clarify special districts\u2019 authority to levy sales tax on the sale of retail marijuana,\u201d a statement from the governor\u2019s office said.\n\nIt will begin October 2.\n\nThe Gazette: Bruce speaks out against Colorado Springs and El Paso County ballot measures\n\nAnti-tax advocate Douglas Bruce sang a familiar tune Thursday afternoon, decrying city and county ballot measures coming up in November.\n\nStanding in front of a handful of media on the Pioneer Museum\u2019s south lawn, Bruce called a set of stormwater fees \u2013 proposed for the city and championed by Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers \u2013 a \u201cbait and switch\u201d and a \u201crain tax.\u201d\n\nIf approved, the fees would charge residential property owners $5 every month, while nonresidential property owners would pay $30 per month for every acre of land they own. The fees would last for 20 years and are expected to raise an estimated $17 million annually. The city already spends $17 million on its stormwater obligations, Bruce said. Approving the fees would change where the money comes from but not the amount.\n\nDenver Post: Park County clears out \u201cFlag Man\u2019s\u201d property after refusal to comply with county code\n\nAfter a monthslong legal battle, Park County has cracked down on code violations by Steve J. Bedigian, known as the \u201cFlag Man of South Park,\u201d and cleared his property of an eclectic assembly of flags and two-by-fours.\n\nIt is among the first actions taken by county officials to enforce county code after admitted Planned Parenthood shooter Robert Lewis Dear Jr. put the unincoporated area near Hartsel on U.S. 24 \u2013 and its living conditions \u2013 on the map.\n\nMany residents of the area known as Hartsel Flats live in RVs, Tuff Sheds and nylon tents without electricity, running water or septic tanks. Dear and his girlfriend moved into an RV down the road from Bedigian in 2014.", "description": "Fox 31: Special session called to fix error costing RTD, .09/02/2019 3:18:23AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
