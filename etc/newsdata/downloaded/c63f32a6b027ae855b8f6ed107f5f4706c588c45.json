Throwback Clip Of SRK Anchoring A Doordarshan Show Is Making Fans Nostalgic\n\nThrowback often finds a new meaning on social media as fans know how to dig out pictures and videos that are pure gold!\n\nAn old video of Shah Rukh Khan, anchoring a New Years eve show in the early \u201890s is going viral on the internet and it's special for reasons more than one.\n\nThe video initially shared on Twitter by an account called Bollywood Direct shows Shah Rukh interacting with his co-anchor. Later, they both introduce Kumar Sanu on the stage to perform. \u201cKumar Sanu, wohi hai jo Kishore Kumar ke andaaz main gaatey hain?\u201d Shah Rukh asks his co-anchor and the video is garnering praises from SRK fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore finding his way to films, SRK made his acting debut with TV series Fauji.\n\nDon't Miss 462 SHARES 103 SHARES 514 SHARES 22.8 K SHARES 553 SHARES\n\nLater, he made his dream debut in 1992, with Deewana.

A lot of fans found themselves taking a trip to nostalgia and good old days of 90's.\n\nOne fan comment on the post reads, \u201cKumar Sanu would have never imagined that he would sing most number of songs for the anchor!\u201d\n\nWoooow !!

I am thinking. I am working on two-three scripts and as soon as they are ready, because I am ready and most of the people working are ready, I will announce it. Till that time, whatever rumours are going around, some of them have given me ideas.\u201d\n\nRecently, at a press conference, SRK said that he will be announcing his next film very soon.", "description": "An old video of Shah Rukh Khan, anchoring a New Years eve show in the early \u201890s is going viral on the internet and it's special for reasons more than one.
