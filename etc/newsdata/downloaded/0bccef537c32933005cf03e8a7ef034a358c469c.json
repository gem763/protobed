Blumenthal assails how Uber and Lyft deal with driver misconduct following Washington Post report", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nFILE - In this April 3, 2017 file photo, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington. (J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) on Wednesday sent letters to both Uber and Lyft seeking information about their driver review policies, following a Washington Post report about how Uber prioritizes liability concerns over safety.\n\nBlumenthal specifically cited the issue of sexual assault and misconduct by Uber and Lyft drivers. He said Uber\u2019s response to alleged incidents was \u201cinadequate,\u201d including when the company doesn\u2019t report such incidents to law enforcement, as the Post revealed in an investigation Wednesday.\n\nIn a letter Blumenthal wrote to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, he said he was \u201calarmed by Uber\u2019s public statements about this issue, which indicate a brazenly careless attitude about your responsibility to your customers.\u201d He cited Uber executive Tracey Breeden, global head of women\u2019s safety, who said in an interview with the Post that the company is \u201cnot judge and jury to determine whether a crime has occurred.\u201d\n\n[When rides go wrong: How Uber\u2019s investigations unit works to limit the company\u2019s liability]\n\nBlumenthal sent a separate letter to Lyft CEO Logan Green, in which he criticized Lyft\u2019s \u201c\u2018labyrinthine\u2019 complaint procedures and an inadequate response to complaints.\u201d A Post investigation, published last month, described how Lyft\u2019s response to allegations of sexual harassment failed victims.\n\nHe called on Uber to release a transparency report about the prevalence of sexual misconduct that occurs in Uber rides, which it has been promising to do since May 2018. Uber has said it will release the report by year\u2019s end.\n\nUber didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Blumenthal\u2018s letter.\n\n\u201cSafety is fundamental to Lyft, which is why since day one we have worked hard to design policies and features that protect riders and drivers,\u201d said Lyft spokesman Adrian Durbin. \u201cWe are eager to engage with Senator Blumenthal and other policymakers to increase awareness and understanding of Lyft\u2019s ongoing safety efforts.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal also chided for Uber for its policies forbidding investigators from referring allegations to police and to inform competitors or background check firms when it blocks drivers from using the app, even in matters of sexual misconduct, as the Post reported. Uber said the policy is in meant to be \u201dsurvivor-centric.\u201d\n\nHe asked Uber and Lyft to commit to fingerprint background checks of drivers and to further explain their processes for investigating allegations of potential crimes that occur during rides.\n\n[How Lyft lost the trust of #DeleteUber women who thought it was \u2018woke\u2019]\n\nThe Post\u2019s reporting indicates that Uber coaches investigators to act to help limit Uber\u2019s liability regarding when serious allegations are filed. It has a three-strikes system that allows bad actors to remain on the road, said investigators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being reprimanded by Uber. The company said there is no strikes policy, but that it looks for \u201cpatterns.\u201d\n\nUber and Lyft also do not have a means for sharing data about bad actors on their platforms, meaning drivers who have in some cases confessed to misconduct can end up simply driving for another ride-sharing app, the Post reported. Uber said it should be up to victims to tell their stories.", "description": "Sen.
