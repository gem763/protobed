Since then, the dog has been the feature of countless memes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt also collided with a real-world moment after the conservative site Daily Wire tweeted the image Tuesday with McCloughan removed.\n\nA watermark for the site appears in Trump\u2019s tweet, but it is a cropped version that removes the attribution of the source photo, which is the Associated Press. That would have indicated that it began as a legitimate news photo, raising the question of whether Trump or a staffer knew McCloughan had been edited out.\n\nA White House spokesman declined to comment. McCloughan, 73, could not be reached for comment.\n\nJeremy Boreing, the chief operating officer at the Daily Wire, dismissed emailed questions about whether the altered photo originated from his publication.\n\nAD\n\nMcCloughan saw the photo as an attempt to herald the dog\u2019s actions in combat, he told the New York Times.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis recognizes the dog is part of that team of brave people,\u201d he said. McCloughan said he worked with military dogs in Vietnam, where they helped scouts detect enemy positions.\n\nMcCloughan was 23 in May 1969 when his unit was caught in a fierce firefight in Tam Ky. He was raked by shrapnel from a rocket-propelled grenade while assessing other soldiers for their injuries, but despite his wounds, McCloughan repeatedly braved enemy fire to carry the injured to safety.\n\nA fellow medic was killed the next day, he later recounted.\n\n\u201cI got him, got his body, and now I\u2019m the only medic,\u201d McCloughan said in 2017. \u201cSo I downed my pack near a tree and got all of my pressure bandages out of there and put them in all of the pockets that I had. \u2026 And now I start going to get men.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcCloughan helped evacuate several other soldiers over the course of three hellish days in combat.\n\nAD\n\nHe was the first to receive the Medal of Honor from Trump.\n\nThe altered photo was tweeted by Trump about three hours before he awarded the Medal of Honor to Army Master Sgt. Matthew O. Williams for bravery in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump basked in the reverence of the award to begin the ceremony.\n\n\u201cNothing like it,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch more:\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "President Trump tweeted a photo taken from a conservative news site that replaced an image of Medal of Honor recipient James McCloughan with one of the dog he said ran down Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D7cmdxXJPGZdBjIXkuSs0VJKZPQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RBVNQD55FNGRFFGRVLS6GJKT2A.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
