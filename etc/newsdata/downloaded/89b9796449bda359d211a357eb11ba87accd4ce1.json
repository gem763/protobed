The family has a total declared wealth of \u00a33.78 million, The Korea Herald reported.\n\nThe would-be justice minister in South Korea faces allegations of ethical lapses involving his family Credit: YONHAP/AFP/Getty Images More\n\nQuestions have also been raised about an investment of more than \u00a3700,000 by his wife and two daughters in a private equity fund that enabled them to avoid paying gift tax.\n\nIn addition, there have been suggestions that Mr Cho\u2019s son was able to avoid compulsory service in the South Korean military.\n\n\u201cI am deeply sorry and apologise over the fact that I was not strict towards my family\u201d, Mr Cho said at the press conference.\n\nHe added an apology to young people struggling to pay university fees.\n\nAllegations of ethical lapses are common in South Korean politics, but these allegations are particularly embarrassing as Mr Cho, a former professor of law at Seoul National University, has been nominated for South Korea\u2019s top legal position.\n\nHe is also known for being on the Left of Korean politics and has in the past aggressively criticised the way in which the children of wealthy people are able to go to elite high schools and obtain places at top universities.\n\n\u201cI have dreamed of progressivism and reform since my younger days and I made my best efforts to achieve that\u201d, Mr Cho said. \u201cI have tried to be a reformer, but I have not been thorough with issues related to my daughter and other issues that surround me. I think I was complacent\u201d.\n\nOnline commentators have described Mr Cho as a \"hypocrite\" and the support rate for Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, fell three points to 45 percent over the weekend.\n\nMr Cho has said that he will not withdraw his nomination.", "description": "The nominee for South Korea\u2019s new justice minister endured an 11-hour grilling at the hands of the media that went on into the early hours of Tuesday and focused on accusations of ethical impropriety by his family.", "authors": ["Julian Ryall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0RK7YreB8FB74AL_kf6ocQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/fc12e0fafb079efcee4ffb0f188d0b38"}
