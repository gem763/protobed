The sentence has only just been made public.\n\nAn arrest warrant was issued for Grundy shortly after he vanished in a neighbour's stolen car following the June 13 2017 stabbing.\n\nThe victim had a life-saving operation to remove a large kitchen knife from her lower back. Her daughter alerted police after finding her lying in a pool of blood on her kitchen floor.\n\nGrundy, who worked as a taxi driver and gardener, is believed to have been sleeping in the vehicle he was using to avoid capture.\n\nClothes and \u00a34,020 (\u20ac4,600) were found inside the car. Benidorm councillor Lorenzo Martinez said at the time the arrest showed the 'efficiency and commitment of the resort's police force when it comes to making Benidorm a safe city.'\n\nHe added: 'It says a lot about the professionalism of our officers.' Juan Carlos Moragues, a central government representative for the Alicante area, confirmed at the time an international arrest warrant was out for Mr Grundy and revealed he had fled the crime scene in a stolen car belonging to neighbours whose house he looked after, leaving his own vehicle where it was.\n\nThe cabbie, from Bolton, (pictured) was caught after a five-day manhunt as police chased him through Benidorm\n\nCourt documents revealed ahead of the trial, which was set to last just one day if it had gone ahead as scheduled, said: 'A man is due to be tried for trying to kill a woman he had been in a relationship with for a few months.\n\n'The incident happened on June 13 2017 at the victim's home on an estate in Orihuela, when both had an argument which state prosecutors say was caused by his jealousy.\n\n'The woman asked him to leave home because she needed time to think but he insisted on continuing the relationship and trying to kiss her and talk to her.\n\n'Subsequently, when the victim was in the bathroom getting ready to go out, he approached her from behind and stabbed her once in the lower back.\n\n'Then he sat her on the floor and left the property. The victim managed to drag herself to the garden to ask her mum and daughter, who were outside waiting for her, for help.'", "description": "David Grundy, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, stabbed Nicole Houghton in the back then fled the scene only to be arrested by police who pinned him to the ground with his trousers halfway down.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/07/20022944-0-image-a-11_1571727063805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
