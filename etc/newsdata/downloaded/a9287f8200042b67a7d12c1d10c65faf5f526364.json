Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMedvedev has a complicated relationship with the Flushing Meadows crowds, who have cast him as a U.S. Open bad boy due to his on-court antics, but the fifth seeded Russian has been as good as gold where it matters \u2014 on the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cI will not say that I\u2019m a kind person or a good person, I can only say I\u2019m a really calm person in life,\u201d said Medvedev, who has incurred $19,000 in fines for an assortment of offences including smashing racquets and giving the crowd the middle finger.\n\n\u201cI actually have no idea why the demons go out when I play tennis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud of what I did. I\u2019m working to never do it again.\u201d\n\nMedvedev may not be winning many friends but he is winning matches. Lots of them.\n\nHis semi-final victory on Friday sends the 23-year-old through to his fourth straight final and stretches his win streak to 12 matches.\n\nThe first Russian man to reach a Grand Slam final since Marat Safin at the 2005 Australian Open, Medvedev will play Rafa Nadal for the title after the three-time champion ended Italian Matteo Berrettini\u2019s surprise run.\n\nAfter spending much of the U.S. Open playing the role of villain, the lanky Medvedev has tried to cast himself as a more fan-friendly figure, distancing himself from the gestures that turned the New York crowds against him.\n\nHe tried to put the bad blood behind him with an apology to the crowd after beating former champion Stan Wawrinka in the quarters, but fans at Arthur Ashe Stadium let him know he still had some fences to mend on Friday, \u2018welcoming\u2019 him with a round of jeers as he walked onto the court.\n\n\u2018CRAZY MATCHES\u2019\n\nMedvedev and Dimitrov arrived at Flushing Meadows in wildly contrasting form.\n\nThe 78th ranked Bulgarian\u2019s play was trending downwards, winning just one of his last eight matches, while Medvedev was riding the momentum from reaching three straight finals, including a win in his last U.S. Open tune-up in Cincinnati.\n\nWith both men fighting for a spot in their first Grand Slam final, every point was contested as if a trophy were riding on it, particularly in a tense opening set that stretched to an hour before Medvedev snatched it in a tie-break.\n\nThe second set produced more long, grinding rallies as the Russian and Bulgarian traded a pair of breaks before Medvedev landed the decisive blow to break Dimitrov and go 2-1 up.\n\nNow in command, Medvedev continued to relentlessly wear down the tiring Dimitrov in a third set that saw him earn a break at 3-1 to take a lead he would not surrender.\n\n\u201cI think the confidence means a lot,\u201d said Medvedev. \u201cI do think he was better player in first set. I was kind of lucky to win it.\n\n\u201cI think after I was playing better than him.\n\n\u201cTalking about first set, these crucial points, this moment in my game, there is something strong that makes me win these crazy sets and crazy matches, which maybe two months ago I would have lost.\u201d", "description": "Love him or hate him, Daniil Medvedev will play for a first Grand Slam title after grinding out a 7-6(5) 6-4 6-3 win over Grigor Dimitrov at the U.S. Open on Friday.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427081347&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8525H-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
