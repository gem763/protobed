This month I saw both, when I traveled to Iraq.\n\nI attended a conference where Iraqi men and women debated and publicly asked tough questions of their government. I also saw a small group of peaceful protesters on Oct. 1; at that point, security personnel calmly stood by.\n\nSixteen years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, Iraq faces daunting challenges, but it still has a degree of freedom that no country in the Middle East except Israel and perhaps Tunisia enjoy. If the U.S. continues to ignore Iraq, this hard-fought and fragile freedom will be lost.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSecurity and economic opportunities matter; the Iraqis protested this month because they are rightfully fed up with lack of basic services, widespread corruption and unemployment, as well as growing Iranian influence in their country.\n\nThis frustration doesn\u2019t only come from Iraqi Sunnis, but from Shiites as well. Indeed, polls show that sectarianism in Iraq has declined in recent years, replaced by a revival of nationalism. This is a positive development.\n\nYet Iraq is at a crossroads. As the peaceful and spontaneous demonstrations spread, security services opened fire, and instated curfews and internet blackouts.\n\nOver 100 protesters were killed and thousands injured. Iraqi President Barham Salih condemned the use of lethal force against protesters and promised to bring those responsible to justice. It is up to the Iraqi government to follow through with this promise, and to implement genuine reforms. But the U.S. cannot turn away.\n\nIn my time in Baghdad, my mind periodically turned to Russia, the country of my birth \u2014 a country that lost its opportunity in the 1990s to transition to a democracy. Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinFunding for Radio Free Europe to return to Hungary will send a strong message Juan Williams: Trump, the conspiracy theory president Putin: Trump not to blame for lack of improved relations with Russia MORE emerged as a result, reconsolidating power and eviscerating post-Soviet Russia\u2019s nascent democracy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI cannot speak for the many, but some in Baghdad privately expressed concern to me that if things don\u2019t change soon, they feared another strongman could emerge.\n\nThat is the last thing they want, as the security promoted by would-be strongmen is often illusionary, and dictators historically bring ruin rather than renaissance to the country.\n\nIraqis are right to protest the deep and growing Iranian influence in their country, but the situation is even worse than they may realize. Other authoritarians also have their sights set on Iraq, and without American involvement, it is easier for them to make inroads.\n\nThe Kremlin \u2014 which fiercely opposed the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 \u2014 had worked for years to return to Iraq, and has accelerated its efforts in recent years. Turkey too has recently agreed to support Iraq\u2019s electricity, while Baghdad has also turned to China for financing reconstruction.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Iraq fatigue set in years ago. Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaObama praises marathon runners Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei for 'remarkable examples of humanity's ability' Each of us has a role in preventing veteran suicide Why calls for impeachment have become commonplace MORE, then a Democratic senator of Illinois, campaigned on getting American troops out of the country. It has been almost a decade since on then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta came to Baghdad to officially end the U.S. mission, creating a vacuum, which the Islamic State soon filled. Now increasingly Americans \u2014 and President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE \u2014 talk of getting out of \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\nMuch can be said about mistakes made after the 2003 invasion, but there is no denying it brought freedom. Forty percent of Iraqis were born after 2003, and know only Iraq\u2019s shaky democracy. But as memory fades of Saddam, they risk believing the alternative promises more.\n\nIraq is not yet lost. But if we continue to ignore it, it soon will be.\n\nAnna Borshchevskaya is senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.", "description": "Iraq is at a crossroads.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/iraq_07142018_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
