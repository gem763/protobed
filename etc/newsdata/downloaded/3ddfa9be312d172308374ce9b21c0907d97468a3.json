Demand in commercial property, particularly offices, has risen to a record high and yields have fallen to a record low, with no sign of buying interests cooling off in a low-interest-rate market.\n\nThe chase for yield globally, particularly with negative interest rates in Europe, makes even the historically compressed capitalisation rates of 4 per cent to 5 per cent in Australian commercial property attractive, property leaders said at last week's Australian Financial Review Property Summit.\n\nResearch house MSCI said a 4 per cent yield on the sale of Macquarie's 30,000sq m tower to be built on the site of the former Tiffany & Co flagship store was realistic.\n\nThe Sydney CBD weighted average capitalisation rate for a premium-grade office at the end of the June quarter closed at 4.8 per cent, even lower than before the 2008 financial crisis hit, MSCI vice-president Bryan Reid said.\n\n\"Competition between foreign and domestic capital, combined with the limited supply pipeline and strong return performance, has meant that investment opportunities in Sydney\u2019s CBD office market have been difficult to come by with the number of interested buyers often outstripping the number of willing sellers,\" Mr Reid said.\n\n\"Some investors who are looking to acquire core assets, but struggling to find suitable assets might therefore see the Macquarie tower as a build-to-core opportunity.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOffice investment irresistible\n\nThese factors make office investment irresistible, especially when returns in some parts of commercial property, particularly in retail, remain soft.\n\nA new owner could be likely to charge net annual rents of up to $1500 a square metre, one of the highest in the Sydney CBD, sources said.\n\nMacquarie is keeping a tight lid on the details of the deal and the bank is steering the sale on its own. None of the major commercial agencies has been approached.\n\nAn artist's impression takes a closer look at the 39 Martin Place development.\n\nThe reason for the sale is hardly surprising, with the financial giant having fielded offers for the asset in the past year.\n\nThe potential of getting a good deal for a \"surplus\" asset makes sense. Macquarie will not occupy the tower, unlike the bigger, 75,498sq m north tower planned for the intersection of Castlereagh, Hunter and Elizabeth Streets.\n\nThat tower will integrate with the new metro station and connect with Macquarie's current headquarters at the heritage-listed 50 Martin Place, creating a big office \"campus\" for the firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe for-sale south tower will yield 30,000sq m of premium office space, a podium and naming rights. It has also been approved for 1000sq m of retail space on the ground and mezzanine levels and another 1000sq m of underground space integrated with the metro station.\n\nThat scheme and the completion deadline of 2024 will need to be met as set out in the agreement between Macquarie and the NSW government.\n\nThe bonus for the new owner would be a chance to draw up its own leasing campaign, as Macquarie has offered the tower without a tenant.\n\nWhen completed, the network of towers and underground passages will emulate other well-known global transport precincts such as New York\u2019s World Trade Centre station and Hong Kong\u2019s International Finance Centre.", "description": "There is fresh speculation the tightly guarded deal could realise a sale price of more than $750 million.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_240/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1200198fd7d9784d7e0abfa3322c0267d778fee6", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
