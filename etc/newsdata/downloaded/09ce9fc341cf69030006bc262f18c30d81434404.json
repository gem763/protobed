REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Illinois has joined a multistate lawsuit aimed at stopping the merger of U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N), the New York attorney general\u2019s office, which is leading the effort along with California, said on Tuesday.\n\nIllinois joins 15 other states and the District of Columbia in seeking to stop the $26 billion merger, which the states argue will lead to higher costs for consumers.\n\nA spokeswoman for T-Mobile said the company had no comment.\n\n\u201cWith Illinois\u2019 addition to our lawsuit, more than half the U.S. population is now represented by states that are suing to block the anti-competitive megamerger of T-Mobile and Sprint,\u201d said New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nLast month, a U.S. District Court in Manhattan ordered that the trial be delayed to Dec. 9, a victory for the states which had said they needed more time to investigate the deal.\n\n\u201cWith fewer companies competing, customers would face fewer choices, higher prices, less innovation and lower quality service,\u201d Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement.\n\nThe Justice Department has signed off on the merger while the Federal Communications Commission has indicated it plans to approve it, and has begun the process of formally doing so.\n\nTo win those approvals, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless companies agreed to divest Sprint\u2019s prepaid businesses to satellite television company Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) to create a fourth U.S. wireless carrier.", "description": "Illinois has joined a multistate lawsuit aimed at stopping the merger of U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp , the New York attorney general's office, which is leading the effort along with California, said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425835693&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821MU"}
