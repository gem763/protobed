Some of it is not trade-related, because some of this is coming from weaknesses in emerging markets, which depend upon their own country-specific factors,\u201d IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath told Yahoo Finance at the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Jackson Hole symposium Friday. \u201cBut that combined with the trade tensions ... that really weighs on the outlook.\u201d\n\nIn July, the IMF downgraded its global growth outlook for both 2019 and 2020. Based on the institution\u2019s latest projections, real global growth will slow to 3.2% this year and pick up to just 3.5% in 2020, with both projections 0.1 percentage points below the IMF\u2019s estimates earlier this year. The IMF in July noted that risks to the forecast were skewed \u201cmainly to the downside,\u201d in large part due to trade.\n\nAnd while the U.S. economy has so far remained strong in comparison to other economies, global concerns could soon broaden out into real domestic problems.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the fundamentals of the U.S. economy \u2013 and given that is quite a consumption-driven economy \u2013 that looks healthy and strong,\u201d Gopinath said.\n\nData on the U.S. consumer has held up, with the most recent reading on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rising the most in six quarters during the second quarter this year. July\u2019s retail sales surpassed expectations, and big-box retailers have posted estimates-topping quarterly results.\n\n\u201cThe headwinds that are going to come will come from what's happening with global growth,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd there is plenty to worry [about] over there.\u201d\n\nChief Economist and Director of the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Gita Gopinath, speaks during a press conference in Washington, DC.

He added that the Fed had \u201cno recent precedents\u201d to guide Fed policy in the face of whipsawing trade policy.\n\n\u201cThese are quite uncertain times. And the data that\u2019s coming in especially on the trade front, on manufacturing and industrial production remains very weak,\u201d Gopinath said, while acknowledging the services sector has provided \u201csome respite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think these factors are weighing on what monetary policy is going to do going forward,\u201d she said.\n\nStrong dollar\n\nThe relative strength of the U.S. economy has also pushed the dollar higher, as investors turn toward the less risky asset amid global softness, Gopinath added.\n\nBut the strong dollar has sparked ire from President Donald Trump, who has called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to help bring down the value of the dollar. The value of the dollar is driven in part by interest rates, with lower rates typically weakening currency and supporting risk assets like stocks.\n\nTrump has maintained that the dollar should be lower to put the U.S. on more equal footing with other countries and their currencies, as goods from a country with a weaker currency are cheaper and therefore more attractive to others in global trade.\n\nBut Gopinath refuted that lower rates would necessarily achieve this outcome.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s many other factors that impact the level of the dollar,\u201d Gopinath said. \u201cThe strengthening of the dollar also has to do with the fact that the U.S. economy is growing at a much more healthier pace than most other advanced economies are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever there is an increased appetite for safety, investors move towards dollar assets, and that's causing the dollar to strengthen,\u201d she added. So it\u2019s not a direct recipe that...if the Fed was to do more by cutting rates, that would actually necessarily weaken the dollar.\u201d\n\n-Jillian Harding and Daryen Ru contributed to this report\n\nSign up!
