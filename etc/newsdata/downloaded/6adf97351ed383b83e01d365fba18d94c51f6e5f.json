For the third quarter, Greater China and North Asia brought in $1.58 billion, a 2% increase on-year. The bank said its income grew in Hong Kong, Korea and China.\n\nSeveral factors have recently affected the business outlook in that region. They include a slowdown in China's economy, the impact of an ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington, as well as widespread and increasingly violent demonstrations in Hong Kong since June. Those protests have affected many of the city's small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThis is breaking news.
