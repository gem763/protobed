And I say, give them more rope to hang themselves,\u201d Rep. Harley Rouda (D-Calif.), who flipped his conservative Orange County district in 2018, said in an interview.\n\nYet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, publicly \u2014 that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point.\n\nThe debate is threatening to cleave Democrats\u2019 unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.\n\n\u201cIf Nancy asked me, I would say sure, let\u2019s have a vote. Everybody\u2019s on record, so they\u2019re not going to vote any differently. What\u2019s the danger in having a vote to formalize it?\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), an early impeachment backer.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nBut the suggestion has provoked strong objections from some of their colleagues who say they would be abdicating their authority if lawmakers permit other branches of government to dictate their procedures.\n\n\u201cIf we allow that to happen, Congress would be completely dysfunctional,\u201d Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) said at a recent town hall event in Glen Ellyn, Ill. \u201cIf we have to take a complete show vote, we'll get the vote. But I find it offensive that they are basically telling us how to do our job with a misreading of the Constitution. Read the freakin\u2019 Constitution. And then let\u2019s honor our oath to it.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Pelosi earlier this week, White House counsel Pat Cipollone said the House was undertaking a \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d and \u201cillegitimate\u201d impeachment process that absolves lawmakers of \u201ctaking political accountability.\u201d The strategy is focused more on the process Democrats have undertaken, and less on defending Trump from allegations that he abused his power by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, which is the chief focus of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nThough a small but growing chorus of Democrats has started urging a vote simply to undercut this GOP talking point, others say that nothing will stop Trump and his supporters from claiming Democrats\u2019 efforts are unfair and inconsistent with past impeachment procedures. They say the party shouldn\u2019t take the White House\u2019s bait, arguing that the president\u2019s defenders will simply find other reasons to not comply with the inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe debate on our side about whether we should or shouldn\u2019t is kind of academic because no matter what we do, the president won\u2019t cooperate,\u201d Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), a member of the Intelligence and Oversight committees, said in an interview.\n\nThough the debate is largely happening in private, it flared up publicly this week when one of Pelosi\u2019s California allies urged her to call a formal vote, arguing that Cipollone\u2019s letter effectively shut the door on cooperating with House Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey want a fight? OK, let\u2019s arm ourselves completely and totally with the full power of Congress,\u201d Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday on CNN. \u201cI do think that it\u2019s time for us to put a vote on the floor \u2014 a resolution for the inquiry structured in such a way that it can move forward with full power of the Congress behind it.\u201d\n\nBut embracing those arguments would represent a reversal for House leaders.\n\nDemocrats have long argued that they don\u2019t need a vote to launch formal impeachment proceedings, even if that had been the practice in prior presidential impeachment processes. In fact, House lawyers backed by Pelosi have made that argument in a succession of court cases seeking evidence to support their impeachment inquiry, and proponents of that position worry a formal vote would undercut their legal claims.\n\nSimilarly, Democrats are worried that a near-term floor vote would drive away a handful of Republicans who are wavering over whether to support impeachment proceedings. A party-line vote would hand the White House another talking point, they argue: that impeachment is a purely partisan effort by Democrats.\n\nBut Pelosi may have more than simply GOP talking points on her mind.\n\nThe House is fighting in court to access former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s closely guarded evidence, and House lawyers say they need it to support their ongoing impeachment inquiry. The Justice Department rejected this argument, contending that the House\u2019s claim to be in the midst of an impeachment process is invalid because there has been no House vote to authorize it.\n\nThough the case is unrelated to the Ukraine scandal now at the center of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, it could determine whether Pelosi changes course and holds a vote on opening an inquiry.\n\nEarlier this week, the judge in the case \u2014 Beryl Howell, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington \u2014 indicated she was inclined to support the House\u2019s position. But she added that a vote would \u201cmake my life very much easier.\u201d Republicans have said a formal vote is the only way for a judge to recognize that an impeachment proceeding has begun.\n\n\u201cWithout an explicit authorization from the full House, the Court has no determinative measure of when an official impeachment proceeding has begun and when the Committee is merely exercising its normal oversight powers,\u201d Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, wrote in a recent filing in the case.\n\n\u201cVotes \u2014 not words or press conferences by Members, the Chairman, or the Speaker \u2014 are the mechanism through which Congress acts,\u201d Collins added.\n\nBut Howell appeared more amenable to Pelosi\u2019s view \u2014 that nothing in the Constitution or in the House\u2019s rules require a formal vote. Howell is expected to rule in the case later this month.\n\nIn the past, when judges have suggested the House should take a vote, Pelosi has responded by doing just that, taking action to preempt unfavorable rulings in court.\n\nEarlier this year, Neomi Rao, a Trump-appointed federal appeals court judge, suggested that a full House vote would be necessary in order to buttress the House Oversight Committee\u2019s subpoena seeking Trump\u2019s financial records. Almost immediately, the House passed a largely symbolic resolution that puts the weight of the full House behind their subpoenas.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Democrats have long maintained that a vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry is unnecessary, but Republicans have pointed to the Clinton and Nixon impeachment processes as precedents for a full House vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a distinction without a difference, and I don\u2019t think we have to pander to the demands of the Department of Justice,\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a senior member of the Oversight panel, said in an interview.\n\nPelosi has long tried to protect her most vulnerable members from politically difficult impeachment-related votes. This vote in particular would give Republicans another opportunity to slam those Democrats whose districts have been historically difficult for the party to compete in. But one of those vulnerable lawmakers, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), indicated she would support Pelosi\u2019s decision if she moved to hold a vote.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a vote is a hard thing to do. I think it\u2019s a delay tactic. But if they need to have it, I\u2019m not against it,\u201d Slotkin said on CNN Wednesday night.\n\nBut Rouda, who, like Slotkin, is vulnerable in 2020, believes Republicans would face more political risks than Democrats with a vote on opening a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWhen that vote comes to the floor, Republicans in swing districts are going to have to make a decision as to whether to continually provide blind faith to the president, blind loyalty to the president, or uphold the oath they took to defend the Constitution of the United States of America,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everybody in the United States is going to see exactly where they stand.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferris contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7c/e4/8da153034559ae884058a34b1d2c/190927-nancy-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
