CNN, however, quoted him as telling a federal judge last week that the impeachment probe may extend beyond Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough: It\u2019s not just Ukraine. If it\u2019s criminal, but even if it\u2019s not \u2014 President Trump can clearly be impeached if he was obstructing justice,\u201d the lawyer reportedly said.\n\nCNN added:\n\nLetter also said that even simply lying to the American public could prompt impeachment. In the court proceeding, Letter was fighting on behalf of House Democrats to obtain the FBI memos from interviews with key White House witnesses that Robert Mueller conducted as part of his two-year probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether anyone from President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was involved.\n\nThe lawyer, who reportedly spent four decades at the U.S. Department of Justice, is reportedly working on behalf of House Democrats with a team of nine attorneys.\n\nThe impeachment probe is supposed to focus on determining whether Trump abused his power as president by withholding aid to Ukraine in a bid to get dirt on Joe Biden.\n\nA \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d allegation that Trump made a quid pro quo offer to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a call on July 25 triggered the impeachment probe. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claimed Trump demanded Zelensky\u2019s cooperation in investigating Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for aid.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the leader of the probe, has also said, however, that there does not need to be a Ukraine-linked quid pro quo to impeach Trump.\n\nHouse Democrats have accused President Trump of obstruction of justice for refusing to cooperate with their impeachment probe, particularly for not relinquishing documents.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama refused to cooperate with congressional investigators seeking information on his administration\u2019s fatal gun-running operation known as Fast and Furious. Nevertheless, neither Republicans nor Democrats sought to impeach him for it.\n\nUnder Fast and Furious, the Obama administration allowed criminals in Mexico to buy hundreds of guns. Some of the weapons were used to kill U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. They were also used to kill or wound an estimated 300 Mexicans.\n\nIn 2012, some Democrats joined their Republican colleagues in voting in favor of holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with their investigation into the fatal operation.\n\nThe courts, not the threat of impeachment, forced the administration to hand over tens of thousands of pages, but the subpoena fight for documents did not end until after Obama\u2019s presidency ended.", "description": "House Democrats may extend the impeachment inquiry beyond Trump's Ukraine-related activities, general counsel behind the investigation said.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Impeachment-Depositions-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
