Michael Fant, Nashville Tennessean\n\nMarcus Mariota was drafted to be the Titans\u2019 quarterback of the future, and for a long time since then, he has been.\n\nIn perception, at least. Not technically.\n\nThe Titans have been content to date Mariota, but they haven\u2019t married him. They\u2019ve wisely kept options open, never committing to a lengthy, expensive agreement that could have secured Mariota\u2019s place in Nashville for years to come.\n\nInstead, Mariota continued to be given every chance to prove the Titans would be his forever team. Opportunities, now six games into his fifth NFL season, finally might have run out.\n\nSunday\u2019s benching of Mariota for Ryan Tannehill, a decision made in the heat of a dismal loss, carried implications far beyond one lost afternoon in Denver.\n\nAre we seeing the end of Mariota\u2019s time with the Titans?\n\nIt sure seems that way.\n\nKnowing the setup in 2019, that this was to be a prove-it year for Mariota to earn a big-money, long-term contract befitting an established NFL quarterback, the verdict now looks obvious. Writing is very much on the wall.\n\nMariota deserved to be pulled in Denver, perhaps sooner than he actually was. The offense was doing next to nothing, leaving zero chance to win a game in which the Titans\u2019 defense kept doing enough to hang in there.\n\nBy the third quarter, Mariota was 7-for-18 passing for a woeful 63 yards and a pair of interceptions. If not now, when? The Titans had little choice but to send out Tannehill to see whether he could light a spark. Comeback efforts failed, but Tannehill was more productive Sunday than Mariota and made a case to remain the starter entering next weekend\u2019s home game against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nNeither Tannehill nor Mariota said after the loss in Denver that they knew which of them would start in the coming week. Coach Mike Vrabel said Monday afternoon that a decision would be made later Monday and then relayed to players.\n\n\u201cWe have to find a way to win a football game,\u201d Vrabel said.\n\nNo matter who ultimately is tapped for this week\u2019s game, Sunday\u2019s benching of Mariota was a milestone moment in a long-running debate about his status. It\u2019s difficult to see the Titans benching a quarterback in Week 6 and then rewarding him with a huge contract after the season.\n\nStranger things have happened. With a long season yet to play out, Mariota figures to have additional opportunities.\n\nBut the Titans have every reason to give Tannehill the football right now. He is the best chance to win. The season is slipping away quickly, but as bleak as things might seem, all is not yet lost. The Titans are only 2-4 and entirely capable of getting hot at the right time and gaining ground. A solid defense makes up for a lot of problems, but there have just been too many offensively under Mariota\u2019s watch.\n\nAn Oregon star with a Heisman Trophy and more than 10,000 passing yards and 2,200 rushing yards in three college seasons, Mariota was the No. 2 overall pick, payoff for a dismal 2-14 season in 2014. He started as a rookie, took lumps and then broke out in 2016, leading the Titans to the first of three 9-7 seasons with 3,426 passing yards and 26 touchdowns versus nine interceptions.\n\nFrom there, Mariota\u2019s future figured to be linked to that of these Titans. And that seemed just fine for everyone. There was so much athleticism and natural ability for Mariota. He was a potentially dynamic quarterback who\u2019d be directing an ascending team.\n\nIt regressed gradually from there.\n\nThose 9-7 seasons continued, but Mariota\u2019s stats began to decline. In 2017, the interceptions jumped to 15, the touchdowns falling to 13. He fired 11 touchdowns in 2018, and while the touchdown mark is already up to seven in 2019, his current 59.1% completion rate is the lowest in his five NFL seasons.\n\nAnd this season has been bad. No sugarcoating it. Basically, Mariota had this season to make his claim for elite NFL status, and he\u2019s simply not doing it. The Titans have not been explosive enough or effective in sustaining drives. It is difficult to watch.\n\nIt\u2019s not all on Mariota. Pass protection has been shaky, but it\u2019s to a point where Mariota isn\u2019t trusting his blockers long enough or his receivers to make plays downfield. He appears tentative, reluctant, safe enough to perhaps avoid miscues but not bold enough to energize an offense that certainly needs it.\n\nHow much of the Titans\u2019 offensive system has had to do with Mariota\u2019s struggles? That\u2019s a matter of fair speculation. Mariota hasn\u2019t always gotten the breaks in Tennessee, dealing with health issues, coordinator changes and a current offensive approach that strives to lean on the running game to set up play-action passes. Perhaps that hasn\u2019t played to his strengths.\n\nIf you took Patrick Mahomes and put him in Tennessee\u2019s offense, what might happen? Better yet, if you put Mariota in Kansas City\u2019s offense, how would that go?\n\nOdds are Mariota would be highly productive in such a setting. He\u2019s almost 26, still young, reasonably healthy, undeniably talented, mature beyond his years and selfless, always eager to accept criticism while deflecting zero blame. There\u2019s every reason to think he still could find consistent NFL success as a starter somewhere.\n\nIt\u2019s looking, however, like that place won\u2019t be Nashville.\n\nAnd that realization is going to bring an adjustment for this entire organization. It can be complicated to topple an NFL quarterbacking tenure, especially one that has lasted a few years and at one point seemed sure of a long and fruitful future.\n\nNonetheless, the Titans continued to play this the correct way, and that will make an overhaul easier to orchestrate. They remained patient on committing to Mariota and kept options open. Now it\u2019s perhaps time for Titans fans to start scanning some of those options, peeking at quarterbacks in the 2020 NFL Draft.\n\nTannehill probably will get an honest crack at the job, too. He might be able to land it. People forget that his NFL career had been spent as a starter, not a backup. The role wouldn\u2019t be too big for him.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot to fix on this Titans offense, perhaps more than one player \u2013 even if he\u2019s the quarterback \u2013 can manage at this point.\n\nSunday\u2019s move felt sudden, but it wasn\u2019t. By the time it arrived, it felt inevitable.\n\nAnd now so does an eventual parting of ways between the Titans and their quarterback of the future.\n\nReach Gentry Estes at gestes@tennessean.com and on Twitter @Gentry_Estes.", "description": "Sunday's benching in Denver was a strong hint that the Titans could be ready to move on from Marcus Mariota, their QB of the future for years.", "authors": ["Gentry Estes", "Published P.M.
