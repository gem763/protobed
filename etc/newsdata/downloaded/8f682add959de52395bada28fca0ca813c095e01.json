It is thought both were ruled out of scope for the Early Parliamentary General Election Bill - which only had a very narrow remit.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nLabour prefer the earlier date for a number of reasons - chiefly that it wouldn't allow time for Boris Johnson to try and bounce Parliament into voting for his Brexit bill before it dissolves for the election.\n\nLabour also say the later date risked disenfranchising students, because they will have broken up for Christmas by the 12th and wouldn't be able to vote in the constituencies where they live for most of the year.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nNumber 10 had indicated it was prepared to pull the election bill altogether if an amendment changing the franchise was attached.\n\nThe PM\u2019s spokesman replied \u201cyes\u201d when asked if the Bill would be pulled if an amendment passed.\n\n\u201cIf you vote for a change in the franchise, you are voting for a delay\u201d, the PM\u2019s spokesman said.\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn said: \"All 16-year-olds should have the right to vote.\n\n\"It seems to me fundamental to our democracy. It's young people's future after all that we will be debating in this election.\"\n\nEU citizens living in the UK can register to vote, and can vote in European Parliament and local elections - but not general elections.\n\nLikewise the Tories have repeatedly refused bids to extend the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds, with the current voting age set firmly at 18.", "description": "Neither of the amendments were selected by the Speaker after Boris Johnson threatened to pull the entire push for an election if they passed", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Dan Bloom", "Image", "Reuters", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656227.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Peoples-Vote-Campaign-Rallies-For-Final-Say-On-Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
