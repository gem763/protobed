More than 80% of covered workers now have a deductible, up from 63% a decade ago. Taken together, the increasing prevalence and cost of deductibles have resulted in a 162% total increase in the burden of deductibles across all covered workers over the past decade, the foundation says. More than one in four covered workers is now in a plan with a deductible of at least $2,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking poor hit hardest: The survey also found that employers with many lower-wage workers \u2014 those earning $25,000 or less a year \u2014 tend to offer health benefits to a smaller share of their workforce than other employers and require higher worker contributions toward their premiums. At firms where at least 35% of employees make $25,000 or less, family premiums average about $17,600, some 15% less than the average at other firms. But those workers at lower-wage firms have an annual family contribution of over $7,000, compared to an average of under $6,000 at other firms. The result is that a far lower share of low-wage employees take the health benefits being offered. Only one in three workers at lower-wage businesses offering health benefits are covered, compared to 63% at other employers.\n\nThe Kaiser survey was conducted by telephone between January and July. It included 2,012 randomly selected employers with three or more workers.\n\nFor more on the survey results, See Kaiser\u2019s summary of findings or the full report.\n\nLike what you're reading?
