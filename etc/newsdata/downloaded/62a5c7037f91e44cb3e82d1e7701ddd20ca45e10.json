How dare you. You're about to be fired.'\n\nDe Niro himself had already launched legal action against Robinson for allegedly spending four full days ordering delivery and watching 55 episodes of Friends on the job.\n\nCanal Prods claims the once-trusted employee raided company coffers and even stole the 76-year-old actor's frequent flyer miles while also binge-watching 'astounding hours' of Netflix.\n\nRobert De Niro, right, is being sued over alleged 'gratuitous unwanted physical contact' and gender discrimination by Graham Chase Robinson, left.

One example was captured in the November 2012 voicemail, transcribed below: De Niro: 'Chase, you are living in Spain and you\u2019re f***ing upset with me cause now you tell me how nice you have it your life over there and you f***ing don\u2019t answer my call? 'How dare you. You are absolutely fired, you\u2019re f***ing history. 'How dare you with all the good things you do this is bulls*** after Christmas.

So, he retaliated and struck first.'\n\nRobinson's new suit states: 'Robert De Niro is someone who has clung to old mores. He does not accept the idea that men should treat women as equals.\n\n'He does not care that gender discrimination in the workplace violates the law.
