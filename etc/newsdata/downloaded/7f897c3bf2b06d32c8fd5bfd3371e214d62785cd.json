Logan, a Berklee College of Music-trained guitarist, and his band, the Kampala Jazz All-Stars, had trekked nearly six hours through the East African countryside to play the gig. With more than 1,000 people in the audience, the group\u2019s vocalist, Darrell M. Blocker, had an idea.\n\n\u201cDude, we have got to start singing some stuff,\u201d he shouted between songs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start doing stuff that they hear and they recognize.\u201d\n\nBlocker cued the band to play \u201cStir It Up,\u201d Bob Marley\u2019s reggae hit.\n\nJim Logan\n\n\u201cEverybody got up and danced,\u201d Logan recalled. \u201cHe turned the whole thing around.\u201d\n\nBlocker knew how to connect with the audience in Soroti because that\u2019s how the CIA trains all of its operations officers \u2013 clandestine agents who work undercover to gather intelligence. The difference, of course, is that most of those skilled operators work in quiet bars or roadside motel rooms \u2013 not singing live before scores of adoring fans.\n\n\u201cMy clandestine activities were enhanced by being viewed as a singer, because who would ever think that one could be both?\u201d Blocker said. \u201cThat is a leap too far for most and I honestly feel that it kept me safer by being in plain sight.\u201d\n\nAs a lifelong vocalist, Blocker always felt comfortable in front of an audience. From his local church choir in Hepzibah, Georgia, to glee club at the University of Georgia, he called singing his first love. But Blocker\u2019s lengthy bout as a spy helped him hone that passion, he said, taking cues from his day job to breathe life into his nighttime performances.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both very intimate...\u201d Blocker recently said, referring to performing onstage and \u201cthe art of espionage,\u201d as he calls it. \u201c...Intimate in the sense that, if you are truly paying attention and listening to whoever is sitting across from you, they will know it, and they will know that you\u2019re sincere.\u201d\n\nDarrell Blocker\n\nBlocker, who recently became an ABC News contributor, spent 32 years in the intelligence community, first as an analyst with the Air Force and then in the CIA\u2019s clandestine service as an operations officer, Chief of Station, and Chief of Africa Division, traversing European capitals and African outposts alike. His job, in his words, \u201cwas to spot, assess, develop, and recruit spies to help keep our nation safe.\u201d In 1996, during an overseas assignment in Dakar, Senegal, Blocker started playing covers with a pianist from Scotland, a guitarist from Canada, and an American Peace Corps doctor, also on guitar.\n\n\u201cWhen they played music they were fine, but singing was not their forte,\u201d Blocker said. So he offered up his services. The group had a standing show on Thursday nights at a British club for diplomats, covering anything from Hootie & the Blowfish to Otis Redding. Soon they started playing house parties.\n\nFast forward to 2003, when Blocker arrived in Uganda for another overseas tour. On Sunday nights in Kampala, the nation\u2019s capital, Blocker visited Bubbles O\u2019Leary\u2019s, a club described by one TripAdvisor commenter as \u201cbrilliant for a night out\u201d and \u201cone of the best places to party in Kampala.\u201d\n\nWithin weeks, Blocker said he struck up a friendship with Logan, a fellow American and the spouse of a U.S. embassy employee who was the founder and lead guitarist of the Kampala Jazz All-Stars. Logan started the band by happenstance, he said, when he met a bass-wielding Brit on his flight from Heathrow to Uganda in 2001. The two started jamming once they settled in, and found local musicians to join them for gigs.\n\nWhen Blocker arrived shortly thereafter, Logan noticed him in the audience at Bubbles O\u2019Leary\u2019s mouthing the lyrics to some of their tunes and invited him to jam with them.\n\nJim Logan\n\nBlocker demurred, but over the next few months Logan persisted. Eventually, Logan approached Blocker and told him that Blocker\u2019s then-wife gave the band 15 of his favorite songs, including his \u201csignature song,\u201d as he calls it, Louis Armstrong\u2019s \u201cWhat a Wonderful World\u201d \u2013 and the band had learned them.\n\nBlocker says he rehearsed with them later that day.\n\nLogan described Blocker\u2019s voice as a tenor, \u201cbut it was a little bit of a smoky voice that fit well in a band that did a lot of jazz instrumentals.\u201d The group developed a following, playing to a packed house of locals, diplomats, and ex-pats at Bubbles O\u2019Leary\u2019s week after week, according to Logan and Blocker.\n\n\u201cThere were maybe a few pop stars [in Uganda] that definitely had better following than we did,\u201d Logan said. \u201cBut for a cover band doing jazz, nobody came close.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just blew up,\" Blocker added, \"to the point that it was starting to get in the way of the reason I was in Uganda\" \u2013 there simply weren\u2019t enough hours in the day to both meet with assets and keep pace with his band\u2019s demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the band \u2013 made up of Logan, two Ugandans, and two Congolese \u2013 had no idea their frontman was living and working undercover as a veteran intelligence officer. His official cover was an employee with the State Department assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Kampala. Logan claims to have had \u201ca hunch\u201d Blocker had a secret job in Uganda, but nearly two decades later he was surprised to learn his lead singer was a highly-trained American intelligence official.\n\n\u201cI remember asking him what he did for work, and he had a canned response. Something-something at the embassy. And you just kind of go, come on,\u201d Logan said. \u201cHe was super smart, you could tell he was very intelligent.\u201d\n\nEvery so often his two worlds would collide. Blocker remembers spotting his assets in the audience during performances.\n\nJim Logan\n\n\u201cYou just learn not to show any more interest in them as you would anybody else,\u201d Blocker said. \u201cThey know and you know that you avoid each other as much as you can.\u201d\n\nOther times, Blocker claims, his status as a local celebrity served the United States\u2019 national security interests. Blocker said performing on stage \u201cexposed me to a whole lot more people than I would have only met at the diplomatic receptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo in that sense,\u201d Blocker continued, \u201cmy singing expanded my circle of potential contacts to pursue.\u201d\n\nThe band got big. So big, in fact, that Blocker started getting recognized. During a rare respite from his busy life in the city, Blocker brought his family to Jinja, a lakeside tourist destination 60 miles west of the Kenyan border. During an ATV tour, Blocker and his family stopped at a mountaintop.\n\nHe noticed a young couple eyeing him.\n\n\u201cThere was nobody else over near where I was, so I looked at them and said, \u2018How are you all?\u2019 They said \u2018Are you in a band? In Kampala?\u2019 and I said \u2018yes\u2019 \u2013 and she hit him like, \"I told you that was him!\u2019\u201d\n\nAchieving local fame in Uganda during his two years with the band was never part of Blocker\u2019s plan, and hardly the extent of his vocal career during his decades spent with the agency. By the end of his career at CIA, which ended in 2018, Blocker reckons he performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at no less than eight U.S. embassies around the world \u2013 a responsibility he does not carry lightly.\n\n\u201cThat's a song that I love and it's a hard song,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm always really, really careful with that song \u2026 I don't ever want to be that guy butchering our national song.\u201d\n\nIn August 2019, the CIA honored Blocker with the Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, one of the highest honors bestowed upon career officers. During his acceptance speech, Blocker named Millicent Mazyck, his high school choral director, as one of the most influential people in his life.\n\nIn retirement, Blocker has a saying: \u201cSpying is easy, singing is hard.\u201d", "description": "Darrell Blocker was the lead singer of the Kampala Jazz All-Stars.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/blocker-03-as-ht-190907_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
