Whether it\u2019s the cardio-protective effect of any alcoholic beverage or the specific antioxidant powers of red wine, the media keeps delivering the good news: Moderate drinking (defined as up to one drink a day for women and two for men) is not only fashionable, it\u2019s healthy.\n\nYet, a recent barrage of other headlines in the news and on social media suggests that it may be neither. That, combined with a growing number of Americans claiming to be part of the \u201calcohol-free\u201d or \u201csober-curious\u201d movement, might be good reasons to reassess what we believe about moderate drinking.\n\nOne drink \u2014 healthy or not?\n\nThere is an abundance of scientific literature showing a link between moderate alcohol consumption and fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, that\u2019s where the good news about drinking ends.\n\nThe \u201cGlobal Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study 2016,\u201d a meta-analysis of nearly 600 studies published in The Lancet last year, reported alcohol consumption as the seventh leading cause of death and disability world-wide. It concluded that \u201cthe level of alcohol consumption that minimized harm across health outcomes was zero standard drinks per week.\u201d\n\nFor moderate drinkers, the biggest health hazard appears to be an increased risk of many types of cancer, with studies showing a linear relationship between the two, meaning the more you drink, the higher your risk.\n\nAlso see: Older adults are binge drinking at alarming rates\n\nHowever, when researchers from British Columbia looked at 87 alcohol studies and adjusted for confounding factors among nondrinkers, the overall health benefits of moderate drinking disappeared. This was also the case when former lifelong abstainers started drinking in moderation during middle age.\n\nIn both studies, deaths from cardiovascular disease were lower among moderate drinkers, but all-cause mortality remained unchanged. They had simply died at higher rates than nondrinkers from other causes.\n\nAdditionally, a 30-year observational study of 550 participants, published in 2017 in The BMJ, British medical journal, found that alcohol in any amount is bad news for brain health.\n\nModerate, schmoderate\n\nPerhaps the real trouble, though, is our inability to moderately consume a substance that impairs our mental, physical and emotional faculties.\n\nTo begin with, the standard definition of moderate drinking in the U.S. \u2014 one or two drinks a day \u2014 is pretty vague. The definition of \u201ca drink\u201d has changed quite a bit over the years. Twelve-ounce beers have become pints and pours of wine have grown from 5 to 6, or even 8, ounces.\n\nAlso, since mixed drinks may contain several different high-proof spirits in one glass, it\u2019s often difficult to know whether we\u2019re staying within those moderate-drinking guidelines. Of course, that\u2019s if we even care to pay that much attention at all.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This might be why millennials are drinking more. (Hint: they\u2019re short and loud)\n\nWhat is certain is that when one drink becomes two, and two become making a night of it, the limited health benefits of alcohol quickly reverse themselves. Both binge drinking and high cumulative consumption over time are associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and all-cause mortality, including from cardiovascular disease, according to a 2015 study by researchers at the University of Barcelona.\n\nThe benefits of taking a break from alcohol\n\nThough the health benefits of light and moderate drinking may be questionable, there\u2019s no doubt about the benefits of taking a break from regular alcohol consumption.\n\nCapitalizing on the \u201cDry January\u201d movement in 2016, a team of London-based researchers measured a battery of biological markers on 94 moderate-to-heavy drinkers who abstained from alcohol for a month, compared with a control group of 47 individuals who continued their normal drinking.\n\nRelated: Here is a simple and healthy way to save $200 this month\n\nAt the end of just one month, the abstainers showed significant improvements in insulin resistance, body weight, blood pressure and cancer-related growth factors.\n\nNote that this study did not include light or occasional drinkers, whose alcohol-related health risks are extremely low.\n\nGoing against the grain alcohol\n\nIf you\u2019re a moderate-to-heavy drinker who\u2019s thinking about taking a break from alcohol, you\u2019re in good company. Driven by ambitious millennials who value high energy and productivity over just getting high, the alcohol-free movement is gaining membership and momentum.\n\n\u201cMocktails\u201d and zero-proof cocktails are popping up on menus everywhere. Ambitious entrepreneurs are creating nonalcoholic spirits and beers.\n\n\u201cThe (non-alcohol) beverage category is expected to increase nationwide by thirty-two percent over the next three years,\u201d says Jeff Hollander, CEO and co-founder of Hairless Dog Brewing, a nonalcoholic craft beer brewer in Minneapolis.\n\nHollander\u2019s company, still in its infancy, is growing much faster than that, though. \u201cWe\u2019re adding two new beer styles late this fall, and will be increasing production by four hundred percent next quarter in order to meet demand,\u201d says Hollander.\n\nThe company, whose beers only average 80 calories apiece and whose taglines are \u201cParty Like There\u2019s a Tomorrow\u201d and \u201c0.0 Regrets,\u201d plans to start shipping its beers direct to consumers\u2019 homes; because they\u2019re nonalcoholic, it can.\n\nOf course, millennials aren\u2019t the only ones leveling up their lives by giving up alcohol. Older Americans also are reassessing how they feel about drinking.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly true for Pauline, 52, of Albany, N.Y., and Kathleen, 56, of Washington, D.C. (they asked that we not use their last names for privacy). Both are participants in One Year No Beer (OYNB), an alcohol-free challenge network created by Ruari Fairbairns and Andy Ramage, of the U.K. The challenge costs about $54 for a month, about $82 for three months and about $231 for a year.\n\nPauline and Kathleen decided to give OYNB a try because they weren\u2019t happy with how alcohol was affecting their lives. \u201cI went on vacation with my daughter last February, and it was a big drunkfest,\u201d Pauline says. \u201cAfter that, I knew I wanted to make a change.\u201d\n\nKathleen echoes the same sentiment: \u201cI was drinking more than I wanted because my whole social and work life kind of revolved around alcohol. I live in a building with a cocktail lounge and a bartender on duty every night of the week.\u201d\n\nThe women recounted tales of struggle early on in their efforts to give up alcohol. They say this was primarily due to the very real social pressure to drink, but also because behavior change is hard.\n\nA new kind of support network\n\nBoth found assistance through OYNB, which Fairbairns helped start for the same reason Pauline and Kathleen described. He says he had been drinking too much for work (he was a high-level investment broker) and felt he had to take a break.\n\nFor Fairbairns, the health benefits were immediate and striking. He lost weight, slept better and had more energy and a clearer mind. A few months in, he ran into Ramage, who had been on his own similar journey.\n\nSays Fairbairns: \u201cWe got to comparing notes, and thought to ourselves, \u2018We\u2019ve got to share this with more people, because life without alcohol is frickin\u2019 awesome!\u2019\u201d\n\nThey started OYNB as a passion project, and soon quit their jobs to work on it full time. It appears it was worth the risk. In just two years, the company has grown to 50,000 members in 90 countries.\n\nKathleen says she feels much better daily abstaining from alcohol. \u201cI\u2019m just a happier person. I feel better overall, my judgment is so much better, and I sleep so much better. I meditate now, and I have this great morning routine,\u201d she says.\n\nYou might like: A beer for the sober set\n\nPauline also reports positive results. \u201cThe best benefit is that I\u2019ve gotten more brain space,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about whether I\u2019ve said anything stupid or if I\u2019m OK to drive. And I don\u2019t want to cover up how I\u2019m feeling or what\u2019s going on. I want to be present in my life.\u201d\n\nAnd that cocktail lounge in Kathleen\u2019s building? They\u2019ve got mocktails on the menu now, too.", "description": "There\u2019s no doubt about the health benefits of taking a break from regular alcohol consumption.", "authors": ["Rashelle Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR110_na_alc_ZG_20190911131018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
