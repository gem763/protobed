'If they feel their voice matters, great.'\n\nJordan, now the majority owner of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, also supports paying college athletes, but admits he doesn't know the best way to go about that.\n\n'I think they should be paid some portion of money so that their basic needs are taken care of,' said Jordan, who hit the game-winning shot for North Carolina against Georgetown in the 1982 NCAA Finals. 'There's some complexity there that I think the NCAA is going to have to figure out.\n\n'Are they entitled to some compensation?' he asked. 'Yes. What is that number? I don't think anyone knows.'\n\nJordan is married to Cuban model Yvette Prieto after divorcing his first wife, Juanita, in 2002\n\nMichael Jordan and his now ex-wife Juanita pictured in 2000\n\nOne issue Jordan declined to address was the NBA's growing rift with China, which came about after Rockets general manager Daryl Morey voiced his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nThe issue jeopardizes the NBA's business in China, not to mention the interests of other brands such as Jordan's longtime partner, Nike.\n\nJordan cited ongoing litigation over improper use of his name and likeness by Chinese companies as his reason for declining to comment.\n\nBesides that, Jordan has become more vocal. In recent years he's spoken out on poverty, violence against unarmed African-Americans, and healthcare inequality.\n\n'When I was playing, my vision, my tunnel vision was my craft,' he said. 'I was a professional basketball player and I tried to do that the best I could.\n\n'Now I have more time to understand things around me, understand causes, Understand issues, problems, and commit my voice and my financial support too.'\n\nThe Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic in Charlote held a ribbon cutting ceremony Thursday attended by the athlete turned business mogul\n\nThe center has been in operation about three weeks, and more than 300 people have already been seen by staff doctors, social workers and other health-care professionals\n\nNow the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets, Jordan is reportedly worth $1.9 billion\n\nWorth around $1.9 billion, according to NBC, Jordan has given $3 million for hurricane relief, another $5 million for the National Museum of African American History in Washington D.C., and untold millions to support Chicago-area charities.\n\nHe's also dropped $7 million on the The Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic - two facilities that will aid uninsured patients in the Charlotte area.\n\nAs he's said previously, if Jordan could play with any four players in their prime, he would choose his former rivals, Magic Johnson (pictured) and Hakeem Olajuwon, ex-Bulls teammate Scottie Pippen, and his former UNC Tar Heels teammate James Worthy\n\nJordan, who was seen crying tears of joy at the unveiling last week, insists he is not doing this for his own legacy.\n\n'That's not my purpose for doing it,' he said. 'My purpose for doing it is because I see a certain need; I feel a certain warmth about it. If I feel like I'm making a difference, that's all that matters to me.'\n\nIn a way, Jordan said at last week's press conference, the clinic serves as a 'thank you' to North Carolina, where he was raised after moving from Brooklyn as a toddler.\n\n'As you can see it's a very emotional thing to me,' he told his audience in Charlotte last week. 'To be able to give back to a community that has supported me over the years when I was playing the game of basketball, to now, where I'm a part of this community.'\n\nThe goal is to use integrated healthcare services to help low-income families in the area achieve upward mobility.\n\n'At the end of the day, if you know you're providing services for people in need, that's all that matters,' he said. 'So I give for the basis of giving. Not to advertise and not to promote. If I feel like I'm making a difference, that's all that matters.'\n\nJordan's Bulls are the subject of an upcoming documentary, but he fears the series is 'too raw'\n\nOf course, no discussion with Jordan would be complete without discussing his Bulls teams of the 1990s, one of which will be featured in an upcoming ESPN documentary.\n\nThe 10-part series titled 'The Last Dance' focuses on the 1997-98 season, which ended with Jordan's sixth title and his second of three retirements.\n\nAfter his second retirement, Jordan became a part owner and team president of the Washington Wizards before ultimately suiting up for his last two NBA seasons\n\nThe problem, from Jordan's perspective, is that it might be too revealing.\n\nFamously competitive and hard on teammates, Jordan is apprehensive about the reaction the documentary will receive when it debuts in 2020.\n\n'I didn't want to do it, in all honesty,' Jordan said.\n\n'It was raw enough that people would not understand the mentality it takes to be a winner and to be a leader,' he said. 'And I'm still nervous about it. It's gonna be interesting when you see how people interpret the whole thing. That's going to be the most intriguing aspect of the whole thing.'\n\nJordan may not be playing anymore, but he is still a salesman and recently unveiled his latest product, a new line of Tequila.\n\n'We decided to do our own tequila,' he said. 'You know, if we sell it, we sell it. If not, at least we got enough to drink.'\n\nAsked about Golden State Warriors star and Charlotte native Stephen Curry, Jordan said he the three-time NBA champion still has some work to do before he'll be assured of a spot in Basketball's Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nAs far as Jordan's all-time team is concerned, that remains unchanged.\n\nAs he's said previously, if Jordan could play with any four players in their prime, he would choose his former rivals, Magic Johnson and Hakeem Olajuwon, ex-Bulls teammate Scottie Pippen, and his former UNC Tar Heels teammate James Worthy.", "description": "After spending $7 million to fund a health clinic in his native North Carolina,  Michael Jordan is opening up on philanthropy, paying college players and his newest nickname, 'Grandpa Mike.'", "authors": ["Alex Raskin Sports News Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19990358-0-image-a-17_1571666969468.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
