With an alarm clock at almost 12 o'clock. With the flags of the UK and the E.U over layered over the top. Photo: Getty\n\nA snap poll of 650 business leaders has revealed that 55% say that MPs should approve the deal prime minister Boris Johnson has sealed with the European Union. Meanwhile, 41% think it should be rejected.\n\nThe survey by the Institute of Directors (IOD), one of the UK\u2019s most prominent business organisations, also revealed that nine out of 10 IOD members also reject a no-deal Brexit, if parliament does not pass Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nThe poll also found that if politicians couldn\u2019t come to a consensus on what should happen in the event of an extension beyond 31st October, holding another General Election would be the least worst outcome.\n\nUK parliament is holding its first Saturday session in 37 years. Johnson is trying to convince MPs to support his agreement he made with the EU and MPs will debate the proposal. Johnson said in a speech \"now is the time to get this thing done,\" adding that delaying past the Brexit deadline of 31 October would be \"corrosive.\"\n\nMPs could delay Brexit again until all the necessary UK legislation is passed and Johnson\u2019s cabinet has threatened to postpone a vote on a revised deal if politicians do vote to drag it out again.\n\nREAD MORE: How new Brexit deal could hit UK economy, wages and public spending\n\n\"The Brexit process has been frustrating and wearying for our members. The paralysis of the current situation prevents directors from moving forward with plans for investment and growth. By no means is there unanimity among business leaders on the path ahead, but avoiding a disorderly exit at the end of the month comes out clearly as a pressing priority,\u201d said Jonathan Geldart, Director General of the Institute of Directors.\n\n\"We have also been listening carefully to the voices of businesses across the UK. There remain legitimate concerns around the changes agreed for Northern Ireland, which are no longer in the form of a backstop but now act as the starting point for its future relationship with the EU.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased a hard border has been avoided. However, there are many more unanswered questions about how this will work. We urge the Government to come forward with clear, concrete commitments around ensuring this does not lead to an erosion of the UK\u2019s internal market over time.\u201d", "description": "The survey by the Institute of Directors also revealed that nine out of 10 members also reject a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UQka6EiDguoKQ3jRtaQ4GQ--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/15882260-f266-11e9-aff7-9d21c27d838a", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
