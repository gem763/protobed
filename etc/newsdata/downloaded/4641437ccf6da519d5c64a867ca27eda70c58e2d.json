The vehicle caught fire, and the family's attorneys claim in the lawsuit that a police officer and other bystanders on the scene were unable to reach Awan because the design of the Model S door handles prevented them from opening the vehicle's doors.\n\nThe Model S has distinctive door handles that lie flush with the vehicle's sheet metal unless the key fob is nearby, at which point they can extend outward, allowing the driver or passenger to grab them and open the door. The door handles on Awan's car would not extend for those who tried to rescue him, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn February, a Tesla representative directed Business Insider to the company's emergency-response guide for the Model S, which says the vehicle must be opened from the inside if the exterior door handles are not working.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit Thursday.\n\nThe attorneys representing Awan's family allege that Awan did not die from the collision's impact. Instead, they say he was killed by the smoke that filled the car after its battery caught fire.\n\n\"The Model S's design precluded those on the scene of the crash from getting Dr. Awan out of the cabin because the door handles failed,\" the lawsuit says. \"The Model S had an unreasonably dangerous fire risk that was not addressed through proper design. And Tesla failed to give any appropriate, adequate, full or fair warnings about the risks relating to the door handles or the smoke and fire.\"\n\nAre you a current or former Tesla employee?
