You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut the current England attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, has urged the RFU to commit to a tour in the future that would see them play games against the Pacific nations even if it does not make sense money-wise, and believes that the nation that invented the sport should not count itself above the rest of the rugby union-playing countries.\n\nWith England set to begin their Rugby World Cup campaign against Tonga on Sunday, Wisemantel said: \u201cThey need to play consistently against the best. The problem is the revenue, whether financially it can be done, that\u2019s the biggest issue. In regard to that, potentially a solution is that in the November window, the Pacific nations get to play one of the big dogs at one of the big stadiums and they get a piece of the pie.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images 3/21 79: Wayne Shelford One of the greats from the originals, Shelford played in six of seven games as the All Blacks won the 1987 Rugby World Cup. Remembered as the man who revitalised the Haka, his legacy in the sport will go on long after he is gone. Getty Images 4/21 78: Jeremy Guscott Guscott featured in three World Cup campaigns, the first two of which produced a final and semi-final appearance. He could have added to that record had injury not ended his 1999 campaign, where an England side without him crashed out. Getty Images 5/21 77: Serge Betsen A formidable opponent who was highly respected by his opponents, such was his talent. However, he features low on the list due to featuring at just one World Cup due to injury. AFP/Getty Images 6/21 76: Brian Lima 'The Chiropractor' by name, Brian Lima was a World Cup force to be reckoned with - just ask Derick Hougaard. The centre became the first player ever to appear at five Rugby World Cups, starring at the 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007 tournaments, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame four years later. AFP/Getty Images 7/21 75: Tony Daly The Australian was a key part of the victorious 1991 Wallabies side and also featured at the 1995 campaign. Getty Images 8/21 74: Alun Wyn Jones The veteran lock will feature at his fourth World Cup in Japan since his first appearance in 2007, and was a key part of Wales's run to the semi-finals in 2011. Getty 9/21 73: Brad Thorn The lock was a linchpin in the 2011 Rugby World Cup-winning New Zealand side, starting all but one of the games including the final against France, and he also played at the 2003 event eight years before, though missed out on the 2007 tournament. Getty Images 10/21 72: Jannie de Beer Killed off England's hopes in 1999 with his memorable five drop-goals in the quarter-final, writing his name into World Cup folklore. Getty Images 11/21 71: Fourie du Preez The scrum-half was South Africa's starting No 9 for three World Cup in a row, an was instrumental in their kick-heavy strategy at the 2007 World Cup that saw the Springboks defeat England in the final. Getty Images 12/21 70: Mils Muliaina The 100-cap full-back was a mainstay of the All Blacks side tat went through the toil of the 2003 and 2007 World Cups, only to secure a fitting farewell by winning the 2011 tournament. A lethal finisher who also had the defensive craft to match, Muliaina was the standout No 15 for much of the noughties. Getty Images 13/21 69: Thierry Dusautoir Inspired France's 2011 campaign when the players took control from coach Marc Lievremont and played the style of rugby they wanted to play. Dusautoir always led by example as one of the best No 7s to play the game. Getty Images 14/21 68: Owen Franks A two-time World Cup winner who proved pivotal to the All Blacks' back-to-back triumphs. Franks changed the game with how tighthead props play, and was unlucky to miss out on a third tournament after being overlooked for 2019. Getty Images 15/21 67: Mike Tindall His brutal dump tackle on George Gregan in the 2003 final showed all the hallmarks of England's defiance in that campaign. Unlucky to miss the 2007 tournament with a broken leg, and although the less said about 2011 the better, his exploits in Australia eight years before cement his place on the list. Getty Images 16/21 66: Keven Mealamu Another member of the All Blacks' double-World Cup winners club, Mealamu was heralded for his performance off the bench in the 2015 final. Getty Images 17/21 65: Glen Osbourne Osborne's best displays of his career came at the Rugby World Cup, scoring five tries in six games across 1995 and 199. Getty Images 18/21 64: Rory Underwood Underwood starred for England at the first three World Cups, with the nation's all-time record try-scorer claiming 11 World Cup tries throughout his illustrious career. Getty Images 19/21 63: Josh Kronfeld One of the great back-row forwards of his generation, Kronfeld went through the agony of twice seeing New Zealand's World Cup aspirations fall short in 1995 and 1999, though it was through no lack of trying on his part. Getty Images 20/21 62: Brian O'Driscoll The lack of Irish players can easily be put down to their dismal knockout record, but O'Driscoll simply has to be on the list for his exploits across the 2003 and 2011 World Cups. For a player of his talent, his World Cup record is no doubt disappointing, but he remained a joy to watch. Getty Images 21/21 61: Willie Ofahengaue 'Willie O' was a giant of the game who helped the Wallabies to World Cup glory in 1991, leading the pack from No 8 with distinction. He retired with the rare accolade of having beaten the All Blacks more times than losing to them.

Other teams have been there, Italy did it a few years ago. I don\u2019t think that just because it\u2019s England you can think you\u2019re above everyone else. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t go there, it\u2019s just what you tack on along the way so if you tack on a game against Australia or New Zealand or whoever, then you make it viable as a tour. But it\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an administrator but you look at tier one vs tier one, as opposed to tier one going to the islands to watch it on a different time zone. It makes it very difficult.\u201d\n\nWisemantel combines his commitments on Eddie Jones\u2019s backroom staff with his work for the World Rugby Combine, a project aimed to accelerate the development of rugby players under the age of 23 across the Pacific nations by identifying the talented individuals, placing them with pre-selected clubs across the globe that are picked on the basis of player welfare, support and financial reward, and helping to bring money back into the countries through the wages that are sent back to families and villages across Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, as is the way of Polynesian life.\n\n\u201cBefore we run the combine they play a series and they are capped so they are capped pre-combine and we then move them around,\u201d adds Wisemantel, who confirms this is done to ensure they are not then picked up by whichever countries they move to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great initiative by World Rugby and it\u2019s worth digger deeper and having a look at. They are capped before they come into the combine so we pick the cream of the three nations, bring them in, test them for a week, put them in game situations, drill situations, testing and just see where they can fit in. And then, there\u2019s another layer to it. Say there are three clubs looking at a certain player, say they are of Tongan descent, we then find the best fit of those three, it\u2019s not just about the money, it\u2019s where there is a Tongan community so we know they\u2019ve had Tongan players before and there\u2019s a support network and they go there.\n\n\u201cThe last piece of the puzzle is that there are no agents in this process and it\u2019s a flat cap. There might be a few add-ons but the actual bottom dollar line is the same across all three. So you actually alleviate a lot of the problems with oneupmanship and that sort of thing. It\u2019s a really good process.\u201d\n\nBut the issue is that while World Rugby appears determined to improve the standard of rugby in the Pacific Islands, the leading unions do not. England and Ireland will continue to avoid the area along with New Zealand, Australia and South Africa \u2013 with the extent of their help stretching to Super Rugby games that are sometimes played in Suva.\n\nThe issue that Wisemantel identifies is that should England tour there, the lack of interest from back in the United Kingdom would be sizeable due to the time difference, with matches typically taking place at approximately 5am.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an early start to watch a game in the Pacific Islands and you go, \u2018OK, who are they?\u2019 he adds. \u201cSo unless you\u2019re a real rugby follower you might go, \u2018England are playing Tonga or Samoa... If you\u2019re into football\u2026[maybe not]. I\u2019d like to see it happen but will it happen? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest Indy Rugby podcast", "description": "The Rugby Football Union has been told it is not above touring the Pacific Islands to help the development of Tonga, Fiji and Samoa by one of its own coaches, having not visited the region for 28 years.
