REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki/File Photo\n\nThe decree applies to crimes committed before Sept. 14, the presidency said. It reduces the death penalty to a life sentence of hard labour, and life sentences to 20 years, among other punishments.\n\nFugitives must turn themselves in within three months to benefit from the amnesty.\n\nThe amnesty does not cover Syrians who took up arms to fight the state, colluded with foreign nations against Syria, or joined insurgents, whom Damascus regards as terrorists.\n\nOther exceptions include drug crimes and arms smuggling.\n\nDraft dodgers inside Syria will have three months to take advantage of the amnesty while those abroad will have six months.\n\nDuring Syria\u2019s war, the government has issued similar amnesties before to pardon those evading mandatory military service, who can face years in prison.\n\nWith Russian and Iranian help, Assad has reclaimed control of most of the country from an array of rebel factions, some that were backed by foreign governments, and jihadist militants.\n\nSyria\u2019s war, which spiralled out of an uprising in 2011, has killed hundreds of thousands of people, uprooted half the pre-war population, and created one of the world\u2019s worst refugee crises.\n\nAid agencies often cite the fear of conscription, and punishment for ducking it, as one of the main reasons refugees give for not wanting to return home.", "description": "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad issued an amnesty on Sunday that reduces sentences for crime and pardons draft dodgers if they report for duty within three to six months.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430148908&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0KN", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
