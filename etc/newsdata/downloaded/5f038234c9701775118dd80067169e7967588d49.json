Afterwards, the days are long and empty.\n\nAnd so Vinnie took to the stage on The X Factor: Celebrity last Saturday, just three months after losing his wife of 25 years.\n\nForget sadness in his eyes \u2013 heartbreak and pain was written all over his entire face, in capital letters, bold type.\n\nHis clothes looked sad. His shoes, his watch, his hat. No one looking at him could have been in any doubt this man was broken.\n\nHe could have hidden away. I\u2019m sure people tried to persuade him to, said it was too soon.\n\nBut here he was, standing in front of hundreds, performing to millions at home.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the best singer. He was at anything but the top of his game. But he was real. And for that, Vinnie Jones must be applauded. If a bloke famous for being a hard man tough nut can show himself at his most raw and vulnerable, that can only be a good thing.\n\nFor all of us.\n\nMy son split his head open in the playground earlier this year, when he was in Reception.\n\nAt every step of the process of getting him put back together \u2013 the school nurse, the staff at A&E, the doctor who treated him \u2013 I noticed the same thing. They all told him to be brave. They commended him when he wasn\u2019t crying.\n\nA four-year-old, covered in blood, hurt and scared, was basically repeatedly told to Man Up. And let\u2019s be honest, Man Up means Shut Up, doesn\u2019t it? I doubt anyone who told him to be brave meant any harm, it\u2019s simply an automatic response at this stage.\n\nThe point is, it shouldn\u2019t be. And intended or not, it is doing harm.\n\nMen need to know it\u2019s OK for them to have feelings, and to show them. That they don\u2019t have to be strong, or silent. If they\u2019re hurting, cry rather than holding it inside.\n\nBecause the terrible truth is you can\u2019t hold it inside for ever. It will come out in some way, shape or form \u2013 slowly seeping over years, or in terrible explosions. It doesn\u2019t just magically go away.\n\nIn 2015, 75% of all UK suicides were male \u2013 it\u2019s the single biggest killer of men under 45 in this country.\n\nThat can\u2019t be a coincidence.\n\nHope sometimes rears its head in the most unlikely places. An ex-footballer on a past-its-prime talent show must be one of the most surprising so far.\n\nBut that\u2019s where we find ourselves.\n\nIt was clearly incredibly difficult for Vinnie Jones to get through that performance.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to us to make it count.", "description": "Men need to know it\u2019s OK for them to have feelings and show them", "authors": ["Polly Hudson", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743281.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-X-Factor-Vinnie-Jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
