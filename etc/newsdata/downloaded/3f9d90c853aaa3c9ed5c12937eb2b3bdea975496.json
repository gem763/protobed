McDonald\u2019s has even established a new tech hub in the heart of Silicon Valley \u2014 the McD Tech Labs \u2014 where a team of engineers and data scientists is working on voice-recognition software.\n\nThe goal? To turn McDonald\u2019s, a chain better known for supersized portions than for supercomputers, into a saltier, greasier version of Amazon.\n\nAs fast-food sales decline across the increasingly competitive marketplace, McDonald\u2019s is looking for new ways to lure customers. On Tuesday, the chain said same-store sales in the United States were weaker than expected for the third quarter, sending shares lower.\n\nBut in the coming years, its machine learning technology could change how consumers decide what to eat \u2014 and, in a potentially ominous development for their waistlines, make them eat more.\n\nSo far, the new technological advances can be experienced mostly at the chain\u2019s thousands of drive-thrus, where for years menu boards have displayed a familiar array of McDonald\u2019s favourites: Big Macs, Quarter Pounders, Chicken McNuggets.\n\nNow, the chain has digital boards programmed to market that food more strategically, taking into account such factors as the time of day, the weather, the popularity of certain menu items and the length of the wait. On a hot afternoon, for example, the board might promote soda rather than coffee. At the conclusion of every transaction, screens now display a list of recommendations, nudging customers to order more.\n\nAt some drive-thrus, McDonald\u2019s has tested technology that can recognize license-plate numbers, allowing the company to tailor a list of suggested purchases to a customer\u2019s previous orders, as long as the person agrees to sign away the data.\n\n\u201cYou just grow to expect that in other parts of your life. Why should it be different when you\u2019re ordering at McDonald\u2019s?\u201d said Daniel Henry, the chain\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cWe don\u2019t think food should be any different than what you buy on Amazon.\u201d\n\nAs the evolution of the McDonald\u2019s drive-thru shows, the internet shopping experience, with its recommendation algorithms and personalization, is increasingly shaping the world of brick-and-mortar retail, as restaurants, clothing stores, supermarkets and other businesses use new technology to collect consumer data and then deploy that information to encourage more spending.\n\nAt some stores, Bluetooth devices now track shoppers\u2019 movements, allowing companies to send texts and emails recommending products that customers lingered over but did not buy. And a number of retailers are experimenting with facial-recognition tools and other technologies \u2014 sometimes known as \u201coffline cookies\u201d \u2014 that allow businesses to gather information about customers even when they are away from their computers.\n\nIn the restaurant world, the increasingly popular food-delivery apps have produced a slew of customer data. But much of that information is controlled by third-party technology companies rather than by the restaurants themselves, underlining the importance of tech expertise in an increasingly competitive industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of the restaurant chains, the larger ones that have the cash and the clout and the depth, are really turning into quasi-technology companies,\u201d said Michael Atkinson, who runs Orderscape, a company that provides voice-ordering technology. \u201cAll of them have that ambition.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Domino\u2019s Pizza has distinguished itself as a technology leader in the slow-moving world of pizza (it\u2019s hard to disrupt a crust recipe), aiming to capture the growing food-delivery market with streamlined phone and online ordering systems, data-collection techniques and even self-driving cars.\n\nLike the new McD Tech Labs in California, Domino\u2019s also has a tech headquarters: the \u201cinnovation garage\u201d in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where teams of employees drawn from departments across the company work on specific projects under one roof \u2014 an approach borrowed from Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 60 years\u2019 worth of legacy corporate structure that we have blown up by moving into this building,\u201d said Dennis Maloney, the company\u2019s chief digital officer. \u201cDomino\u2019s started off as a pizza company that sells online, and we\u2019ve managed to transform ourselves into an e-commerce company that sells pizza.\u201d\n\nSo far, however, Domino\u2019s has stopped short of the latest McDonald\u2019s play: acquiring entire tech startups. (Pizza Hut, however, recently acquired a company that produces online ordering software.)\n\nIn March, McDonald\u2019s spent more than US$300 million to buy Dynamic Yield, the Tel Aviv-based company that developed the artificial intelligence tools now used at thousands of McDonald\u2019s drive-thrus.\n\nThe deal \u201chas changed the way the high-tech industry thinks about potential M&A,\u201d said Liad Agmon, a former Israeli intelligence official who co-founded Dynamic Yield. \u201cWe\u2019ll see more nontraditional tech companies buying tech companies as an accelerator for their digital efforts. It was genius on McDonald\u2019s side.\u201d\n\nAlready, the recommendation algorithms built into the drive-thru menu boards have generated larger orders, the McDonald\u2019s chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, said during an earnings call in July. (Henry, the chain\u2019s information executive, declined to reveal the size of the increase.) By the end of the year, the new system is expected to be in place at nearly every McDonald\u2019s drive-thru in the U.S.\n\nIn September, McDonald\u2019s purchased a second tech company, Apprente, a startup based in Mountain View, California, that develops voice-activated platforms that can process orders in multiple languages and accents. In recent months, McDonald\u2019s has tested voice recognition at some of its restaurants, seeking to replace the human workers who take orders with a faster system.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s insists that the rollout of the voice technology will not cost jobs. But at a time when it faces renewed protests from workers over low wages and sexual harassment, the chain\u2019s new focus on technology could intensify scrutiny of how it treats its workers and how they might be affected by automation. While McDonalds has reported impressive growth over the last couple of years, some employees at its restaurants make less than US$10 an hour.\n\n\u201cTry raising a family on that,\u201d said Adriana Alvarez, an employee in Cicero, Illinois, who has helped lead the high-profile campaign for a US$15 hourly wage at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cThe company should be able to balance tech and other investments and, in the process, ensure workers like me are safe on the job and have a seat at the table.\u201d\n\nBefore the robot apocalypse, AI might simply make us fatter\n\nWith unemployment at just 3.5 per cent in the United States, the fast-food industry is facing one of its worst labour shortages in decades. Rather than eliminate jobs, McDonald\u2019s claims that voice-recognition technology would allow franchise owners to reassign workers to understaffed areas of their restaurants. But across the industry, fast-food experts say, some chains may attempt to use voice tools and other technologies to replace workers.\n\n\u201cThe labour shortage frankly has done more to push restaurants toward technology than almost anything else,\u201d said Jonathan Maze, the executive editor of Restaurant Business Magazine, a trade publication. \u201cIt enables you theoretically to be able to run your restaurant with fewer people.\u201d\n\nAt the McDonald\u2019s drive-thru on Fort Hamilton Parkway in Brooklyn, every order still must go through a human being: Last week, the voice on the other end of the speaker sounded perplexed when a reporter turned down the free soda that usually comes with a cheeseburger and fries.\n\nBut the rest of the drive-thru experience \u2014 with its digital screens and recommendation algorithms \u2014 does indeed feel a bit like shopping online.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great, efficient way to take people\u2019s money,\u201d said Marayah Jerry as she waited at the drive-thru to collect a Ranch Snack Wrap. \u201cI\u2019ll come with an idea of what I want, and then I see the pictures, and I\u2019m like, \u2018That looks good.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother drive-thru customer, Dalila Ruiz, said she noticed the suggested add-ons at the bottom of the menu board but resisted the temptation to splurge. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be so fat,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\nNot all McDonald\u2019s customers are likely to show such discipline. Critics of artificial intelligence have long warned that the technology could lead to a dystopian future in which humans are subordinate to machines.\n\nBefore the robot apocalypse, however, AI might simply make us fatter.\n\n\u201cThere are real, significant unintended consequences of something like this further driving unhealthy eating and more fast-food eating and obesity rates and diabetes rates going up,\u201d said Scott Kahan, a doctor who directs the National Center for Weight and Wellness, an obesity clinic in Washington, D.C. \u201cThese sorts of technologies are making it hard for people to just find some reasonable moderation.\u201d\n\nThere is plenty of precedent for companies like McDonald\u2019s finding creative ways to persuade Americans to consume more calories. But the marriage of a fast-food giant and an artificial-intelligence startup marks an unusual new chapter.\n\nWhen Agmon, the co-founder of Dynamic Yield, announced the McDonald\u2019s acquisition in a company WhatsApp chat in March, his colleagues thought he was joking. \u201cWhen you start working for a tech company,\u201d Agmon said, \u201cyou don\u2019t expect this.\u201d\n\nSoon, however, the news began to sink in: The next day, 250 McDonald\u2019s hamburgers arrived at Dynamic Yield\u2019s headquarters in Tel Aviv, along with fries for the whole staff.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t really a McDonald\u2019s crowd. By the time the staff finished hugging and congratulating each other, the burgers were cold.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "McDonald's is trying to change how consumers decide what to eat \u2014 and, in an ominous development for their waistlines, make them eat more", "authors": ["David Yaffe-Bellany"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/big-mac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
