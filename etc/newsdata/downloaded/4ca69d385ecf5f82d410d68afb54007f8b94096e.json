Lack of profitability is tolerated (until it's not) throughout equity markets and it's a luxury often afforded to mid-sized and large-cap growth companies, so conventional wisdom says why not apply to small caps?\n\nWhat Happened\n\nProfitable or not, small caps are riskier than larger companies, but if lack of profitability is added into the equation, than the risks exponentially increase. For investors looking to dial back that risk profile while adding an element of quality to small-cap investing, the WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Fund (NYSE: EES) is an ETF that makes a lot of sense.\n\nEES follows the WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Index, which only includes companies that \u201chave generated positive cumulative earnings over their most recent four fiscal quarters prior to the index measurement date,\u201d according to WisdomTree.\n\nWhy It's Important\n\nThe emphasis on profitability with EES does not mean investors sacrifice performance. Over the past three years, the Russell 2000 Index and the Russell 2000 Value Index are up an average of 29.25%, but EES is higher by 36% over the same span.\n\n\u201cSince its inception, WisdomTree\u2019s methodology has maintained an average 12% under-weight in companies with negative earnings compared with the Russell 2000 Index,\u201d said WisdomTree in a recent note. \u201cThe emphasis on profitable companies has been beneficial over the long term as well because WisdomTree\u2019s methodology has outperformed the Russell 2000 Index by almost 90 basis points (bps).\u201d\n\nAmong small caps, at least in the EES universe, cyclical sectors do not mean lack of earnings. The ETF allocates 44% of its combined weight to consumer discretionary and industrial stocks.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nEES is a core fund intended for use by long-term investors. To that, the profitability focus can reduce volatility during times of elevated market turbulence, times that often impact small-cap stocks more than other market segments.\n\n\u201cAn earnings-weighted approach to small-cap equities can also help protect on the downside during periods of heightened volatility because high-quality companies can simultaneously provide a defensive allocation,\u201d according to WisdomTree. \u201cDuring the painful fourth quarter of 2018, WisdomTree\u2019s method managed to outperform the Russell 2000 Index by 115 bps, with its 13% under-weight in negative earners providing more than two-thirds of the advantage.\u201d\n\nRelated Links:\n\nA Marvelous Mid-Cap ETF\n\n3 Nifty Utilities ETF\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
