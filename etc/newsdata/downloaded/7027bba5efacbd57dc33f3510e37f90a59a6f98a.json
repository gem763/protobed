The only problem is that it\u2019s had at least six 21st birthdays already.\n\nThe company is showing everyone a cute, celebratory doodle on 27 September to mark the company\u2019s coming-of-age. However, there\u2019s nothing especially meaningful about the 27th in the Google timeline. There\u2019s at least six other days that have been celebrated as Google\u2019s birthday \u2013 and none of them are any more meaningful than any of the others.\n\nIndeed, Google might not even be 21. If we use one date \u2013 when the Google.com domain was first registered \u2013 then the company turned 22 on 15 September this year.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Google was given its first investment of $100,000 in August 1998 \u2013 paid to Google Inc, which didn\u2019t actually exist yet.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

next month, Google files for incorporation in California, making it an official company and giving it a bank account to deposit that check in. That happened on 4 September, 1998 \u2013 the earliest of the celebrated birthdays, and probably the one with the best claim to being the actual birth of Google. The rest of September sees a number of big moments for Google. Those include the establishment of its first workspace \u2013 in a garage \u2013 and the hiring of its first employee.\n\nAll of that confusion led Google to admit in 2013 that it didn\u2019t really know when its birthday was.\n\nAs such, it has celebrated on at least four days in September: the 7th, the 8th, the 26th and the 27th. The latter \u2013 which appears to be what Google\u2019s sticking to for now \u2013 was first celebrated in 2002, on Google\u2019s 4th birthday, though the company has celebrated a range of other dates since.\n\nBut in fact, Google has spent much of the month celebrating its birthday \u2013 sending out posts and decorating various parts of its headquarters. Google is perhaps so big that it can\u2019t just be pinned down to one day \u2013 apart from when it needs to make a Doodle for it.\n\nThe problem is complicated even more by the involvement of the Google Doodle. Google\u2019s Doodles are actually older than Google itself is, officially.\n\nThe company posted its first Doodle on 30 August, celebrating the Burning Man festival. But even the earliest estimate of Google\u2019s birthday \u2013 4 September, when the company was incorporated \u2013 happened a week after that.", "description": "Google is celebrating its 21st birthday.
