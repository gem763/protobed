Sense Time and Megvii are known for the development of computer vision technology that underpins facial recognition products, while iFlytek is known for its voice recognition and translation services.\n\nAlong with the tech companies, the Commerce Department's filing targets local government agencies in China's northwestern Xinjiang region.\n\nThe filing said the listed groups have been implicated in \"China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance\" against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim minority groups.", "description": "The United States on Monday blacklisted 28 Chinese companies that develop facial recognition and other artificial intelligence technology, saying they were implicated in the repression of China\u2019s Muslim minority.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Tom Harris", "Zoe Strimpel", "Pieter Cleppe"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212384511-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
