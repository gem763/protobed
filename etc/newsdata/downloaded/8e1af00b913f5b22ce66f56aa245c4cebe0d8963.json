Trump\u2019s abortive reset with the Kremlin (however suspect its motives) seems to have awakened former reset fans to the belated understanding that the Russians are not our friends.\n\nOn North Korea, many liberals loudly assailed Trump for his \u201cfire and fury\u201d rhetoric about Kim Jong-un. Now they mock him, correctly, for his na\u00efvet\u00e9 about the North\u2019s malign intentions.\n\nOn Ukraine, the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to supply the country with anti-tank missiles when it was being dismembered by Russia met with consternation from the likes of John McCain, but less-than-vociferous opposition by Democrats. Now the supply of those same weapons has become a vital \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against the prospect of renewed Russian aggression.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bret Stephens", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Democrats-Neocons.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
