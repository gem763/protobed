All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nThe history Trump invoked is brutal.\n\nLynching is the extrajudicial murder of an untried suspect, usually by a mob and often by hanging. In the United States, 4,743 lynchings were recorded between 1882 and 1968, according to the NAACP. Of those murdered people, 3,446 were black men, women and children \u2014 about 73 percent. Research by the Equal Justice Initiative, which created the lynching memorial, found a different number of black victims: about 4,400 between 1877 and 1950.\n\nAD\n\nLynching victims were often tortured before they died, and after death their corpses frequently desecrated. Such was the case for Matthew Williams, who was lynched in Salisbury, Md., in 1931.\n\nAD\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s DeNeen L. Brown wrote last year, Williams was accused of killing a white man over a pay dispute, which he denied. He had been shot in the leg and was in a hospital when he was tied in a straitjacket, thrown out a window and stabbed with ice picks by a mob.\n\nThey dragged him three blocks and tied a noose around his neck, taunting him and raising and lowering his body. After he had died by hanging, the mob drove his body through a black neighborhood, cutting off body parts and throwing them onto black families\u2019 porches, shouting, \u201cMake n----- sandwiches!\u201d\n\nUsing lynching to taunt other African Americans is by no means unique to the murder of Williams. In fact, racial intimidation was the point. When Cleo Wright was lynched in Sikeson, Mo., in 1942, his wife was forced to identify his body by the white mob who murdered him. His corpse was then burned in front of two black churches full of worshipers.\n\nThe legacy of lynching echoes through to today. A sign marking the site where 14-year-old Emmett Till\u2019s body was found in 1955 was shot up so many times that the newest version was made out of bulletproof material.\n\nOther lynching victims, like Henry Smith, were burned alive. Smith was accused of killing a white girl in Paris, Tex., in 1893. A posse captured him, paraded him through town on a carnival float, tortured him before a crowd of 10,000 and then set him on fire. People in the crowd clamored for pieces of bone to keep as souvenirs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSometimes, the white mob took photos to sell souvenir postcards. You can view the postcards showing the 1916 lynching of teenager Jesse Washington in Waco, Tex., here.\n\nAlthough African Americans were most frequently targeted, they were not the only victims of lynching. Some white victims were lynched for helping black people; immigrants from countries like Mexico, China and Australia were also lynched.\n\nSo, for comparison, impeachment is not a lawless mob committing murder but a group of democratically elected officials following a process laid out in the U.S. Constitution for the potential removal of a president. The president is simply removed from office, not from this earth.\n\nAD\n\nThe current impeachment inquiry is not the first to be compared to lynching, as Princeton historian Kevin M. Kruse pointed out Tuesday in a tweet.\n\nAD\n\nFifth, this isn't the first time people have referred to an impeachment proceeding against a president as a \"lynching\" -- it came up often when conservatives tried to defend Richard Nixon in the Watergate investigation. pic.twitter.com/XwRpju7jPn \u2014 Kevin M. Kruse (@KevinMKruse) October 22, 2019\n\nThough Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters he agreed with Trump, calling it \u201ca lynching in every sense,\u201d the comparison largely drew condemnation from across the political world, from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and former Florida governor Jeb Bush to Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) and presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nYou are comparing a constitutional process to the PREVALENT and SYSTEMATIC brutal torture of people in THIS COUNTRY that looked like me? https://t.co/3v4oMuPC6C \u2014 Congressmember Bass (@RepKarenBass) October 22, 2019\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nAD", "description": "Lynching is a form of murder often used to terrorize black people.
