I\u2019m going to stop,\u2019\u201d Baldwin recalled.\n\nOn a Friday before the show was set to air, Michaels got him on the phone in an eleventh-hour effort to change his mind.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand,\u2019\u201d Baldwin said of the conversation. \u201cAnd I go, \u2018What don\u2019t I understand? I\u2019ve been thinking about it all summer. Every day I\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u2019 And he said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand how important this is.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith some convincing, Michaels urged him to return.\n\n\u201cSo he said to me, \u2018You should come and do it. Your audience demands it\u2019 \u2015 or something like that,\u201d Baldwin remembered. \u201cSo I came, and I did it. And I\u2019m going to do it a few times.\u201d\n\nBaldwin, who has repeatedly suggested he may not be donning his blonde wig for much longer, said in a June interview with USA Today that he was \u201cso done\u201d and that he would have no problem passing the torch to Anthony Atamanuik, who played Trump on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe President Show.\u201d", "description": "The actor is once again hinting at eventually leaving his \"Saturday Night Live\" role.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dadf056200000e91b506538.jpeg?cache=muadwl85lv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
