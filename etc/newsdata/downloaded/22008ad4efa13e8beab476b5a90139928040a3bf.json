And now they have a shot to win the World Series in Houston on Wednesday night.\n\nBecause when it was all added up Tuesday, and the Nationals kept stretching fate, they beat the Houston Astros, 7-2, to force a Game 7 at Minute Maid Park. Stephen Strasburg allowed just two runs, both in the first, in 81/3 dominant innings. Eaton went yard in the fourth, Soto did two batters later, and Rendon later hit a homer and double to collect four RBI and provide breathing room. Washington has now won four elimination games this October and, with that, will fight for as long as the calendar allows.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTheir season, their comeback from a 19-31 record in May, their sprint through the playoffs and this clash with the Astros, will come down to one game Wednesday night. It will decide everything. It will start, for the Nationals, with Max Scherzer on the mound.\n\nThey felt they\u2019d needed just one good bounce \u2014 a bloop single, an Astros error, anything \u2014 to turn this series back around. They had left Houston with a two-game lead last week, closing in on history, carrying belief. Then they returned in a hole, trailing 3-2, trying like mad to slow the Astros and start their engine again. But now they had Strasburg on the mound. They\u2019d won all four elimination games he\u2019s pitched in, going back to 2016, and it was fitting that he went out and nearly tossed his third career complete game. These Nationals will ride their rotation until the end.\n\nAnd it was Strasburg who, not two weeks ago, best summed up Washington\u2019s sprint through the postseason. In the clubhouse after Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, after the Nationals clinched a World Series berth, Strasburg looked at the beer-soaked floor and squinted. He considered why some teams get a title chance and others don\u2019t. That\u2019s when this thought popped into his head: \u201cYou have a great year, and you can run into a buzz saw. Maybe this year we are the buzz saw.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe was right for another two games. He was wrong when the series swung against Washington. Then the Nationals came back to Houston, where they\u2019ve yet to lose this October, and again looked like the team no one wants to face. They took a quick lead, when Rendon singled in Turner in the first, but it evaporated. Strasburg\u2019s first four pitches went like this: a double for George Springer, a wild pitch to move up to third, another ball in the dirt, then a sacrifice fly from Jos\u00e9 Altuve. The score was knotted again, just like that, then Alex Bregman crushed a homer to nudge the Astros ahead.\n\nSpringer ambushed a 94-mph fastball coming straight down the middle. Bregman got a nearly identical pitch, watched the ball arc through the air, and carried his bat to first base before dropping it into the dirt. Strasburg settled into an unshakable groove, blanking Houston for the rest of the night, and the offense used that as a springboard. They scored just three runs across the three losses at their ballpark. Then they silenced the Astros\u2019 crowd with a pair of fifth-inning swings, first on Eaton\u2019s solo homer, and then with Soto\u2019s before he mimicked Bregman and brought his bat down the line, too.\n\nThen the game went totally sideways in the seventh.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe inning began with Yan Gomes poking a leadoff single to right field. Next came Turner, at the top of Washington\u2019s order, and he hit a dribbler in front of the mound. Turner was a step from the base, and mid-stride, when Brad Peacock hit him with an offline throw. Turner advanced to second, Gomes to third. The Nationals led by a run and had a chance to grow their lead. But that\u2019s when Sam Holbrook, the home-plate umpire, signaled Turner out for runner\u2019s interference.\n\nWashington Manager Dave Martinez began screaming, the veins popping from his neck, his fists balled up as he pushed onto his toes for more volume. The call was confirmed upon a long replay review. Turner stood at the lip of the dugout, staring at the crew, stepping onto the field before his teammates moved in the way to calm him down. And by the end of the inning, even after Rendon eased the drama by parking a Will Harris cutter in the seats, Martinez was ejected for continuing to argue Holbrook\u2019s ruling.\n\nMartinez was restrained by Bogar and bench coach Chip Hale while charging at Holbrook. That left Hale to press the final buttons of the Nationals\u2019 pitching plan. But Strasburg made that process very simple. He completed a gem at 104 pitches. He handed the ball to Sean Doolittle, to leave no doubt, and the closer shut the door. And the Nationals kept on breathing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis sport, when stripped of its nuances, when whittled down to size, is really just a constant search for one more. Pitchers work for hours, staring at video, leafing through scouting reports, even losing sleep, to throw one more strike. Batters stay in the cage, swinging until their hands sting, swearing they\u2019re almost done, to find one more hit. Teams are no different, once individuals become a whole, once those hours add up to a season, and all that matters is earning one more chance.\n\nSo there were the Washington Nationals on Tuesday, in the twilight of October, boiling eight months of work into a final, simple task: They have to win one more game. That\u2019s it.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInning-by-inning recap\n\nby Sam Fortier\n\nNinth inning (Nationals 7, Astros 2)\n\nAnthony Rendon \u2014 as he always has throughout the postseason \u2014 delivered when the Nationals needed him most. He ballooned the team\u2019s cushion with a two-out double to right in the ninth, pushing the lead to 7-2.\n\nStephen Strasburg nearly went the distance. After getting one out in the ninth, Sean Doolittle entered to wrap it up.\n\nAD\n\nWS Game 6 hug for Strasburg. pic.twitter.com/LJsF4K0cJ3 \u2014 Rudy Gersten (@DCBarno) October 30, 2019\n\nEighth inning (Nationals 5, Astros 2)\n\nThe Nationals 5-6-7 hitters have done little to advance the team\u2019s cause so far, combining right now for a 1-for-11 clip with one single (Howie Kendrick) and one walk (Ryan Zimmerman). Going down in order in the eighth also means Victor Robles \u2014 0 for 3, five straight strikeouts in the series \u2014 will lead off the ninth.\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals needed Stephen Strasburg and he\u2019s delivered. He could keep delivering because, after navigating a quick eighth by retiring the heart of the Astros lineup in order, he\u2019s only at 101 pitches. He could pitch the ninth. There\u2019s nothing left to save him for.\n\nSeventh inning (Nationals 5, Astros 2)\n\nThe umpires made one of the most controversial calls of the World Series on Trea Turner. The Nationals shortstop dribbled a ball just in front of the plate and pitcher Brad Peacock got off the mound to field the ball. He threw to first and, just as Turner stepped on first, the ball arrived. Turner hit the glove of first baseman Yuli Gurriel and knocked it off. Umpires ruled the play interference and called Turner out. On review, it looked as though Turner was in the base paths and it was just a bad throw. Umpires reviewed it and still called out Turner, who was livid and needed to be restrained at the top step of the dugout by teammates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBall don\u2019t lie. Two batters later, Anthony Rendon mashed a two-run home run to left.\n\nSorry even we can't help with this one https://t.co/LNtIEYUM8K \u2014 Baseball Reference (@baseball_ref) October 30, 2019\n\nYeah, this one is not going to go over well.

He yelled at the umpiring crew as bench coach Chip Hale and first base coach Derek Bogar held him back. He kept screaming and, after about 30 seconds, they ejected him. Martinez has perhaps never been that emotional as Nats manager. He continued seething and the coaches continued restraining him until, finally, he went back down into the dugout to the clubhouse.\n\nDavey Martinez just got tossed from Game 6. pic.twitter.com/mfcPAeLKJZ \u2014 Rudy Gersten (@DCBarno) October 30, 2019\n\nChip Hale you gotta tighten up that grip man pic.twitter.com/oTcxOU4bwr \u2014 Jomboy (@Jomboy_) October 30, 2019\n\nStephen Strasburg appeared amid the chaos and walked to the mound. He passed his manager, who was on his way to getting ejected, and didn\u2019t do much more than look over at Martinez as he got tossed. Then the Nationals right-hander refocused and kept shoving. He struck out Robinson Chirinos, flew out Josh Reddick and flew out George Springer to get through the seventh on 97 pitches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSixth inning (Nationals 3, Astros 2)\n\nThe Astros hooked Justin Verlander after he allowed the two home runs in the fifth, meaning he\u2019s on tap to go 0-6 in the World Series in his career. Houston went to right-hander Brad Peacock, and he mowed through the Nationals lineup in order. He retired Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera, Ryan Zimmerman and Victor Robles \u2014 all three of whom have struggled mightily since Game 2.\n\nNo! Justin Verlander is the first pitcher in #WorldSeries history to make 7 starts without winning a game https://t.co/FaaQunD1Ri https://t.co/vBxVhczos3 \u2014 Baseball Reference (@baseball_ref) October 30, 2019\n\nZimmerman especially has cooled off this postseason. In an unusual move, he started crushing right-handers early in the playoffs. He hit one against the Dodgers and two doubles against the Cardinals. But since his homer in Game 1 of the World Series, off another right-hander, he\u2019s 3 for 19 with two infield hits and three walks. This could be regression to the mean against right-handed pitching.\n\nStephen Strasburg, at 77 pitches, faced down the heart of the Astros order in the sixth: Alex Bregman, Yuli Gurriel and Yordan Alvarez.\n\nThings began auspiciously as Bregman legged out an infield single just ahead of Nationals shortstop Trea Turner\u2019s throw. Gurriel grounded to short, but too slow to be a double play ball, so he and Bregman flipped places. Then Alvarez tapped a ball back up the middle and the Astros exchanged runners on first again with another fielder\u2019s choice. Strasburg handled the last out himself, striking out Carlos Correa for a second straight time.\n\nFifth inning (Nationals 3, Astros 2)\n\nAdam Eaton crushed his second home run of the postseason into the right-field seats and gave the Nationals a brand new ballgame. They have now had more base-runners in this game (seven) than in all of Game 5 (six).\n\nJustin Verlander made a competitive pitch to Juan Soto, putting a 96-mph fastball up and in to the young left-handed hitter. It didn\u2019t matter. Soto, a feaster on fastballs, a hammerer of homers, crushed the four-seamer into the right-field seats to give the Nationals the lead again. And, for emphasis, he carried his bat to first base, just as Alex Bregman did in the first inning. The Nationals didn\u2019t need to plunk Bregman to get even. They just needed to recapture the lead.\n\nThis dude Juan Soto really carried his bat to 1st base too!\n\n\n\nAlso a legend. pic.twitter.com/SVFHsPPfBe \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 30, 2019\n\nJuan Soto has 3 World Series homers.\n\n\n\nThat's the most by a player age 21 or younger in a single World Series all-time. \u2014 Sarah Langs (@SlangsOnSports) October 30, 2019\n\nThe Minute Maid Park crowd, stunned after the Nationals two homers in the top of the fifth, started to get back into it in the bottom of the inning. Stephen Strasburg struck out Robinson Chirinos to start the inning, but then Josh Reddick lined a single over the shift and the crowd rocked. The PA system commanded \u201cMake some noise!\u201d and the Astros fans obeyed. The fans stamped for George Springer as the team\u2019s leadoff hitter marched to the plate, and they roared when he doubled to left.\n\nStrasburg needed to wriggle away. He couldn\u2019t cough up the lead a second time. He jumped ahead of Jos\u00e9 Altuve 0-2 and struck him out on a curve in the dirt. He faced Michael Brantley, one of the hottest hitters in the World Series. Brantley smoked a ball but right at shortstop Trea Turner, shifted just beyond second base. Turner made a backhand scoop and threw to first in time. Strasburg averted the crisis.\n\nThe Nationals worked against Justin Verlander, ratcheting his pitch count up to 75 after four innings, but they wasted another great opportunity. Howie Kendrick singled and Ryan Zimmerman worked a walk, so they had two on and one out with a chance to capitalize. They didn\u2019t. Victor Robles continued a World Series-long slump by striking out and Yan Gomes flew out to left. It was another chapter in the RISP struggles the Nationals have had all series and seemed briefly ready to snap out of in the first.\n\nStephen Strasburg is still not settled in. We\u2019ve seen this Strasburg before, in Game 2 of the World Series as well as Game 5 of the NLDS. He gives up a couple runs and/or rockets in the first two innings and then becomes the dominant Strasburg he was most of this season for the Nationals.\n\nBut despite starting the fourth as though he was becoming that Strasburg again, using his fastball, change-up and curve to collect two outs, he then lost his feel. He threw 10 balls in 11 pitches and issued two-out walks to Yuli Gurriel and Yordan Alvarez. Then he stepped off the back of the mound, worked the ball in both hands and cleated the rubber. He threw a strike, and then another one, and finally a third one that got him out of the inning via a Carlos Correa strikeout.\n\nThird inning (Astros 2, Nationals 1)\n\nJustin Verlander almost matched Stephen Strasburg\u2019s dominant second with one of his own. Then Adam Eaton worked a seven-pitch walk. Anthony Rendon followed that up with a 10-pitch walk and ensured that, no matter what happened, Verlander would leave the frame dinged. When he finally got Juan Soto to bounce out, escaping the two-on, two out jam, he was at 56 pitches through three innings.\n\nOne of the most concerning parts of Stephen Strasburg\u2019s outing so far \u2014 besides the missed fastball location \u2014 were the exit velocities of hits off him. Before the third, he\u2019d allowed five balls hit at 95 mph, and even the outs got smoked. Yordan Alvarez grounded out to second in the second but smacked the ball at 104.3 mph. Things changed in the third. Strasburg struck out Josh Reddick, grounded out Springer and popped out Jos\u00e9 Altuve. All were softly hit balls that might have assuaged some concern for Strasburg.\n\nSecond inning (Astros 2, Nationals 1)\n\nJustin Verlander made some of the same mistake pitches Stephen Strasburg did in the first \u2014 94ish-mph fastballs over the middle \u2014 but the Nationals couldn\u2019t take advantage. Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera fouled the first one off, and he foul-tipped the second one into the catcher\u2019s mitt for strike three. Ryan Zimmerman flew out to left and Victor Robles didn\u2019t even make contact on his strike three.\n\nStephen Strasburg sailed through the second with the help of some aggressive Astros hitters. He dispatched Yordan Alvarez on a groundball to second after two pitches. He got Carlos Correa to ground to third after three. He retired Robinson Chirinos with a grounder to second after two. Strasburg delivered the settle-down inning he needed and sat at just 20 pitches after two innings.\n\nFirst inning (Astros 2, Nationals 1)\n\nTrea Turner singled on a soft groundball to third base and, just like that, the Nationals had the lead runner on for the first time since Game 2. Adam Eaton sacrifice bunted, of course, and Anthony Rendon inside-outed a slider outside with two strikes to knock it the other way into right field. Turner scampered to the plate. The Nationals had equaled their number of runs in each of their three home games three batters into this one.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 lead lasted approximately eight minutes. George Springer ambushed a first-pitch, middle-middle fastball for a leadoff double. Then Stephen Strasburg threw a wild pitch that sent him to third. Jos\u00e9 Altuve lifted a high-enough, deep-enough flyball to left that Springer sprinted home well ahead of the throw by left fielder Juan Soto. The game was tied again.\n\nIf Springer scoring sparked a fuse in Minute Maid Park, Alex Bregman detonated it. The crowd exploded when the third baseman smashed another middle-middle fastball into the Crawford Boxes in left field. Bregman, after mashing the home run, carried his bat all the way to first. This is a rare, bat-flip-esque move and it likely caught the attention of the Nationals. Yuli Gurriel nearly followed it up with a back-to-backer, but Nationals left fielder Juan Soto caught it at the bullpen wall. The Nationals narrowly escaped with a one-run deficit.\n\nThis dude @ABREG_1 really carried the bat to 1st base.\n\n\n\nLegend. pic.twitter.com/TQqhfSVjUq \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 30, 2019\n\nPregame\n\nHome vs. road comparison.\n\nGlass half-empty: The Nats' bats have been icy the last three games.\n\n\n\nGlass half-full: But look how hot they were in Houston. pic.twitter.com/9DLy7fymJg \u2014 Post Sports (@PostSports) October 29, 2019\n\nPhi Slama Jama in the house.\n\nNBA legends and former Houston Rockets teammates Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler are throwing and catching the first pitch tonight at Game 6 of the World Series.
