His startled father-in-law fatally shot him.", "language": "en", "text": "Christopher Bergan had flown 4,500 miles from Norway, where he and his wife live, to get to the Florida Panhandle. It was supposed to be a birthday surprise for Dennis, who was turning 62 the next day. Instead, it was a tragedy: The bullet hit Bergan \u201cstraight in the heart,\u201d Santa Rosa County Sheriff Bob Johnson said, killing the 37-year-old instantly.\n\nAD\n\nCalling the shooting a \u201ctragic accident,\u201d authorities announced on Thursday that they wouldn\u2019t be pursuing criminal charges against Dennis.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this much: Anybody who\u2019s religious out there, you need to pray for this family because this is \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through,\u201d Johnson said during a news conference. \u201cI really can\u2019t. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nIn a coincidence that may have contributed to Dennis\u2019s state of mind the night of the shooting, another relative had pounded on his front door at about 9:30 p.m. The two had a \u201cverbal altercation,\u201d Johnson said, and Dennis chased that relative off.\n\nBergan probably didn\u2019t know that when he landed at the airport around 11 p.m. and headed to Dennis\u2019s house. A Norwegian citizen, Bergan had lived in Florida for years before returning to his native country with his wife.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Dennis realized whom he\u2019d shot, the family quickly called 911. They pressed towels to his chest in a desperate attempt to stop the bleeding, authorities said. But it was too late.\n\nAD\n\nBecause of the earlier confrontation, the sheriff said, he wasn\u2019t going to \u201csecond-guess\u201d Dennis.\n\n\u201cI mean, here he is, he just had a confrontation at the front of his house,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA couple hours later, someone else is banging on his backdoor. It\u2019s a fenced yard, somebody jumps out of his bushes \u2014 you can\u2019t really say anything against Mr. Dennis for doing what he did. I think it was just a horrible accident that should never have happened.\u201d\n\nThe family was devastated by what happened. In an interview with Oxygen.com, neighbor Patty Munzell described Dennis as \u201ca kind man.\u201d He has \u201clost a best friend,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think that it will take a long time for the family to heal,\u201d Munzell said, \u201cif ever.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nInside the jury room, an agonizing deliberation to sentence Amber Guyger\n\nTekashi 6ix9ine\u2019s testimony brought down two gang leaders.
