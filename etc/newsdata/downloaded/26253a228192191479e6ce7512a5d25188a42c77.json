It was the opening night for a restaurant named Dome of the Sea, and Grant and his fellow guests were welcomed by a young blonde playing a golden harp as she sailed a seashell boat through a pool of water.\n\nThere is indeed magic in the strings of Gayle Levant\u2019s harp, but it has reached far beyond her brief stint as a mermaid and into a 60-year career. Her harp opens every episode of The Simpsons, one of several hundred scores she has worked on including Titanic, Lost and Grease. She has played alongside Judy Garland, spent 22 years in the orchestra for the Academy Awards, and worked on records with Frank Sinatra, Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, the Carpenters, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga and more. When a legend needs a harpist, it is Levant they call.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gayle Levant as Dome of the Sea\u2019s inhouse mermaid (1965).

She\u2019s also an incredible improviser and some songs have been crafted around her playing.\u201d\n\nThe woman that Nat King Cole nicknamed \u201cLittle Bit\u201d is now 77 and lives in Los Angeles with her husband John Richards, a retired Hollywood sound engineer. \u201cI really am singing through my fingers,\u201d she says, audibly smiling. \u201cIf you breathe in love and play from your heart, you feel satisfaction.\u201d\n\nI first contacted Levant when I wondered who was playing the harp in Lana Del Rey\u2019s recent song Doin\u2019 Time \u2013 a moment that wakes a sleeping, 50-foot-tall Del Rey in the video. It turns out that Levant has the same Californian heart that beats under Del Rey\u2019s latest record. Brought up in LA, her talent was first spotted when she was three years old and overheard her father \u2013 a concertmaster violinist to several LA studios \u2013 practising at home. When Levant ran to tell her mother that \u201cDaddy played a wrong note!\u201d her parents quickly arranged her first lessons.\n\n\u201cMy aspirations were not to be a symphony harpist, but to be a studio recording harpist,\u201d says Levant, who fell in love with the instrument after mastering the piano. \u201cThe wonderful thing about doing studio work is it\u2019s always fresh and new.\u201d She spent her teenage years driving around Hollywood with her six-foot harp on the back seat and recorded her first commercial aged 17. In 1961, she got a phone call that Liberace needed a harpist. \u201cLee loves beautiful dresses,\u201d said Liberace\u2019s musical director Gordon Robinson. \u201cDo you have any formal gowns?\u201d Levant showed up with half a dozen and bagged the job.\n\nRay Charles said: Oh mama, let me hear that harp. I thought I was gonna pass out Gayle Levant\n\nThe work started to stack up, including sessions with Ray Charles. \u201cListening to a playback, he says: \u2018Oh mama, let me hear that harp.\u2019 I thought I was gonna pass out.\u201d Pitch-perfect notes are still a must, but Levant has a rarer quality that keeps her phone ringing. \u201cWhen I go into the studio, it\u2019s all about my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I help? How can I make it better?\u201d\n\nAt a 1963 Liberace show in Las Vegas, \u201che had a protege that he was introducing and this girl came on the stage in a long, very simple grey dress,\u201d says Levant. \u201cShe opened up her mouth and sang Happy Days Are Here Again. And that was it.\u201d It was Levant\u2019s first impression of Barbra Streisand. Since 1969, she has worked on all of Streisand\u2019s recording projects. During one session, Levant remembers that \u201cBarbra was trying to get a certain feel from the rhythm section. Everybody took a break because she wasn\u2019t hearing what she wanted. I went over to her and I said: \u2018Barb, can I play something for you?\u2019 I went over to play the Fender Rhodes [electric piano] and I said: \u2018Is that the feel you\u2019re looking for?\u2019 She looked at me, threw her hands up and said: \u2018Why does it take a woman to understand me?\u2019\u201d\n\nStreisand is just one artist who recorded in the studio that Levant opened in 1979 with composer Charles Fox and her former husband, music arranger Artie Butler. Soundtracks recorded within the walls of Evergreen Studios include Beauty and the Beast, Platoon, and perhaps most fittingly for Levant, The Little Mermaid.\n\nIn the eyes of Groban, however, Levant isn\u2019t a mermaid, but his orchestra\u2019s very own guardian angel. \u201cGayle has played on almost every album I\u2019ve ever done because it\u2019s never just a gig to her,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut beyond that, she was one of my first friends in a very intimidating world. I\u2019ll never forget her kindness to me, that smile and hug and welcoming, when I was scared to death in those first orchestra sessions. It never gets less intimidating but if I peer over to the corner and see Gayle sitting there, I know there\u2019s love.\u201d\n\nLevant can\u2019t imagine working any other way. \u201cI try to share my heart with everybody, whether they need me as a friend or they just they want me musically,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just living in gratitude. I\u2019d love for future generations, when they look back on their lives, to have their hearts so full.\u201d", "description": "Just 17 when she first backed Liberace, Levant has been heard on countless films and is a reassuring studio presence for everyone from Barbra Streisand to Lana Del Rey", "authors": ["Sarah Woolley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2b943e6be8b4fdc5eacb100b898a045c11d7bdd/0_597_4498_2698/master/4498.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=046fe613c2df4afd0daab84833034372", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
