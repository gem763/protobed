And greater emotional engagement was associated with more change in habits. This showed the linked benefits of feeling part of a community, reckoning with difficult feelings, and taking constructive measures.\n\nThis kind of research has been put into practice at New York University\u2019s Environmental Health Clinic, which prescribes climate-friendly actions and group activities to its visitors. \u201cThere\u2019s less space for anxiety emotionally when you take practical steps,\u201d Hickman notes.\n\nThis is true even for extreme feelings. Hickman has counselled parents who fantasise about killing their children, out of fear of the climate-ravaged future. But she calmly points out that history is rife with examples of parents preparing to end their children\u2019s lives in order to protect them. \u201cIf we disallow those feelings, we\u2019re just driving them back into the unconscious,\u201d Hickman argues.\n\nThe parents who confess these dark thoughts to her aren\u2019t actually going to act on them, she believes, and it\u2019s important for them to have a safe, shame-free mental space to express the depth of their anxiety. Psychotherapy and other psychology tools can help people become more comfortable with the uncertainty that is inevitable when it comes to climate change.\n\n\u201cOne of the routes through the anxiety is to engage with your grief and your sense of loss,\u201d Hickman says.", "description": "Climate anxiety is affecting more people as climate change progresses.
