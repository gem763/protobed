REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on Wednesday requiring federal agencies to go through a similar process of public input and explanation when they issue key \u201cguidance documents\u201d and pledged White House scrutiny.\n\nTrump said his orders require agencies to seek public input on \u201cthe most important guidance and the whole process will be closely overseen by the White House.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s orders say the public can ask agencies to withdraw guidance they believe is wrong. The White House said agencies must give the public \u201cfair notice of any complaint against them and a chance to respond.\u201d\n\nAgencies must offer opinion letters to individuals and businesses who request them in order to help people comply with the law, Trump said, in a \u201ctireless fight to curtail job-killing, soul-crushing regulations.\u201d\n\nOpponents say Trump has failed to properly regulate environmental, safety and other issues.\n\nGuidance documents can be issued far faster than regulations, which typically take years from start to finish. The White House says because such documents can have a practical effect similar to regulations, they should be subject to the same cost-benefit analysis and public input as formal rules.\n\nActing Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the executive orders will discourage \u201coff-the-book regulations and prevent unfair penalties from being levied on American families and businesses by rogue agencies.\u201d\n\nTrump has made eliminating regulations a priority.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on Wednesday requiring federal agencies to go through a similar process of public input and explanation when they issue key \"guidance documents\" and pledged White House scrutiny.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1439006226&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9823K", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
