I know these stories about her have been repeatedly coming out in the press.\n\n'She really wanted to get to the bottom of it and she did. I know Coleen and I am friends with both. Coleen is very intelligent, very bright. I don't think she is given enough credit for that.\n\nShe said: 'Coleen has been doing her detective work for a couple of years now. I know these stories about her have been repeatedly coming out in the press'\n\nOn Vardy, she said: 'I can't believe she would do this. What are the reasons? She doesn't need the money. She has got a wonderful lifetyle, a wonderful family' (pictured in January 2018)\n\nLizzie said: 'I know Coleen and I am friends with both. Coleen is very intelligent, very bright. I don't think she is given enough credit for that'\n\nThe flip side: Claudia-Liza Armah made clear that Vardy has denied the accusations and that other people do have access to her Instagram account\n\nThe FAKE stories Coleen shared which were sold to The Sun and followed by media outlets Wayne and Coleen Rooney's \u00a320m 'Morrisons' manor is 'flooded On Tuesday, it was claimed that the Rooney's basement had flooded due to Storm Lorenzo. It was said to have caused a 'massively stressful' setback in the completion of the sprawling three-storey mansion Coleen Rooney 'is so desperate for a baby girl that she's looked into controversial \u00a38K gender selection treatment' The Sun first reported that mother of four sons, Coleen had looked into 'gender selection' treatment in a desperate bid for a daughter and had flown to Mexico earlier this year to discuss the controversial \u00a38,000 treatment with doctors Coleen Rooney 'hopes to revive her TV career including a Strictly stint now she's moved back to the UK' after husband Wayne's scandal The Sun wrote that she was in talks to revive her once successful UK TV career now her family has moved back to this side of the Atlantic. The mother-of-four apparently had to decline the offer to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing but could compete in 2020\n\n'She is determined and wanted to know who is releasing these stories. Whether it's right to out someone in the way she did is another question, but it was really upsetting her and upsetting her family life.'\n\nLizzie said she admires the way Coleen found out the truth.\n\nShe said: 'She wanted to get to the bottom of it. It was a clever way to do it. I am one of the followers who follow her on her private Instagram.\n\n'And I did wonder what was going on as she had been very quiet. I've got such a busy life and I didn't see anything coming up - but I would have a flick through.'\n\nLizzie knows Rebekah well and said she still can't believe this is something she would do.\n\nShe said: 'I can't believe she would do this. What are the reasons? She doesn't need the money. She has got a wonderful lifetyle, a wonderful family. It just beggars belief.'\n\nClaudia made clear that Vardy has denied the accusations and that other people do have access to her Instagram account.\n\nShe asked Lizzie what Rebekah is really like and she replied: 'I love her. We were at the National Television Awards together. We have great fun.\n\n'She doesn't need the money, she doesn't need the fame. The only other reason is possibly to keep in with journalists and press by giving these stories.\n\n'I have to say, for Coleen to do this, she must have had concrete evidence, because there is no way she would put this on social media knowing it's going out to the world.\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these shock claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and she concluded that it was Rebekah Vardy's account\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation - she also slammed her for going public when she is heavily pregnant\n\n'She wouldn't do this unless she knew 100%. Really, I just can't believe that Becky would do this. Coleen really feel she has done it.'\n\nClaudia added: 'Rebekah also follows two of the journalists who reportedly posted these stories.'\n\nLizzie replied: 'Well yeah she does. But she is in the public eye. There are a lot of journalists who follow me and I follow them.\n\n'I do a radio show with one of the top journalists in the country. It's part of our work. It doesn't mean she's guilty.'\n\nLizzie also hinted that Coleen could have got the idea for her detective work from Jennifer Lopez.\n\nShe said: 'I once interviewed J-Lo and I asked her how she keeps her close knit circle of friends and how does she know who to trust?\n\n'She said, \"I give fake stories and when that fake story is released, I know it's them and I get rid of them\".\n\n'Coleen felt very strongly about this and it's been very upsetting to her and her family for months.\n\n'She wanted to out that person... and that person is Becky Vardy.'", "description": "She is friends with Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy so it comes as no surprise that Lizzie Cundy has been called upon to give an unbiased view of their feud.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/09/19529594-0-image-a-21_1570695888748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
