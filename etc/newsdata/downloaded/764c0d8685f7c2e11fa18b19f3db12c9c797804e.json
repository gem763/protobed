But it could have been so different for England and their most-prized player, as she has revealed just how close she came to switching her allegiance to Portugal, the team who the Lionesses face in their latest friendly on Tuesday.\n\n\"Portugal got in touch when I was 16, I turned around and said to my mum, 'If I don't make the England team before my 22nd birthday I'm off to play for Portugal,' because I was doing everything I could,\" she says.\n\n\"I was playing well on the pitch and I thought I deserved a call up [for England] and it took a long, long time. But I fought my way into the squad. I knew I could go and play for Portugal and I would have loved it as much. England was always the dream.\"\n\nLuckily for the Lionesses, Bronze received her first senior call-up four months shy of her 22nd birthday and the rest is history. Phil Neville will undoubtedly be happier than ever that the versatile Lyon right-back is playing in an England shirt this evening, as they aim to end an abysmal winless streak which stretches back to their World Cup exit in early July.", "description": "When Lucy Bronze was belatedly presented with Uefa's player of the year award and the World Cup silver ball at the Riverside Stadium on Saturday, the nearly 30,000 crowd stood in resounding applause.", "authors": ["Molly Mcelwee", "Jim White", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212067265-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDhV2K8uQsCbKQWf5axWl7jXYafLZgJ5HdAz1f2P3Kuc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
