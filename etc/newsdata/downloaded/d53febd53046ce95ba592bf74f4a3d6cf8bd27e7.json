If it comes from Brian [McNamee, chairman of CSL and former CEO] it's in red.\n\n\u201cIf it only comes to me and I'm the only one on the e-mail on the \u201cto\u201d line it's a different colour \u2013 it's blue. If it's just to me I'll answer those more frequently.\n\n\u201cIf I'm on the copy line it's all in grey. I give people feedback on email because I've had people say, \u2018Well, you never answered my e-mail\u2019 and I said: \u2018Because you copied me, so why would I answer it?\u2019\n\n\u201cI said if you're just doing it to cover yourself and make sure that you know people know that you copied me on it \u2013 why'?\n\n\u201cThen I get people that send these return/receipt requested emails. Well, it's like they want to know that I've read it. And I'm like, if you have time to check everybody's email and who read it, then you're not busy enough. So I will call them directly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen they get a call from me and I talk about their email, all of a sudden I don't get those emails any more.\n\n\u201cBut I tell people if you want an answer from me put me on the \u201cto\u201d line and only me on the \u201cto\u201d line. And then if it's a silly question or something that you know really should be delegated to other people, we'll talk about that as well.\"\n\nCSL CEO Paul Perreault and chairman Brian McNamee mark the 25th anniversary of its ASX listing. Peter Braig\n\nPerreault encourages email communication because it fits with the CSL culture of wanting people to be involved across the organisation and around the world.\n\n\u201cI do agree that emails can cause a lot of issues because everybody can be involved or say something because they have access to it and that's not necessarily a good thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen used appropriately I think it's fine but there is a lot of wasted time with emails.\u201d\n\n'Everywhere and nowhere all at once'\n\nPerreault says his day usually includes phone calls, conference calls, video calls and site visits. If he is in Utah he will work from home. He speaks to chairman McNamee every week.\n\n\u201cIt's a global company so you have to be everywhere and nowhere all at once, right?\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt's a very difficult life for the family. It's difficult for people in the company that want access to me if I'm not in the right geography or time zone, but I'm constantly available.\n\n\u201cI mean I rarely shut down. But I do have five hours during the night where my phone is only for family emergencies, so I set it for family. If it rings in the middle of the night, I know it's family and I know it's important.\u201d\n\nPerreault says he has less control over what is in his diary at CSL than at any other time in his career, which included 15 years at Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, now part of Pfizer, before joining CSL in 2004 through the acquisition of Aventis Behring.\n\n\u201cThere are certain things that are in my diary two years out - board meetings, the AGM, results, roadshows and the things that you have to do as a CEO that you need to schedule,\u201d he says.\n\nHe spends about 100 days of each year in Melbourne, which is the location of several CSL factories, the CSL research hub and is home to several members of the global leadership team, including the chief financial officer David Lamont and chief scientific officer Andrew Cuthbertson.\n\n\u201cI'm here not just for the board, shareholders and results but also because we have a big business here as well especially with our R &D hub, with Broadmeadows and with the flu manufacturing in the southern hemisphere in Parkville.\n\nOn the road 200 days a year\n\nPerreault says he will need to spend an increasing amount of time in Australia because of the expansion of the R &D hub to involve more biotech start-ups and the construction of new bespoke headquarters in Melbourne's Elizabeth Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI'm gonna need to be here to make sure that all of that is appropriately being done,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the operational side of the business is really out of the US because it is the largest market by far and that's where a lot of the development work is done.\n\n\u201cOur largest manufacturing facilities are in the US and our plasma collection comes out of the US and that's almost half of our employee base working hard every day to collect plasma from these wonderful donors. So, it's all of those things that take my time.\u201d\n\nPerreault says when he became CEO of CSL in July 2013 he did not want to be like the CEOs he used to complain about who did not know enough about what was going on in the business.\n\n\u201cSo, I get criticised by people, including board members, that I travel too much but I'm on the road you know over 200 days a year and it's travelling to the sites, it\u2019s the roadshows, it's the Australia piece, it's the US piece,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt's the connection with people, it's the management by walking around, it's showing people that you're interested in what they're doing in the organisation. And if it's not that, I'll do video conferencing.\u201d\n\nPerreault this year took the view that too much of his available time for working on CEO tasks was being taken up in the operations side of the business as he tried to connect everybody across a complex ecosystem.\n\nCSL is different to most big pharma or biotech companies because 65 per cent of its costs are in raw materials and manufacturing, compared with about 65 per cent spent on R &D and marketing for others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was feeling like I was the only one that could see across the organisation in terms of the impact of the various pieces and functions that contributed to everything starting with plasma supply, demand planning, IT and AI,\u201d he says.\n\nThis resulted in the appointment in May of Paul McKenzie as chief operating officer with responsibility for ensuring the maximum efficiency in the CSL end-to-end supply chain.\n\nPerreault says McKenzie has brought new thinking to CSL about a whole range of supply chain issues including its approach to packaging. Perreault wants to leverage CSL\u2019s size to get better deals without compromising the company\u2019s cast-iron commitment to patient safety.\n\nIn between site visits, conference calls, board meetings and investor engagement, Perreault is working on CSL\u2019s 2030 strategy. He has to look forward that far because the typical life-cycle development of a new blood product is between eight and 12 years.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not looking now what\u2019s going to be there in 2030 I\u2019ll be behind the eight ball every single time,\u201d he says. \u201cInnovation has to start early and it has to be sustainable.\u201d", "description": "Perreault\u2019s day starts with a 5am workout \u201cto get the blood flowing\u201d and then emails, which are colour-coded, and, don't bother cc-ing him if you want a reply.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/eb55b40c57545f03219ddd0bebe99cb0552cb384", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
