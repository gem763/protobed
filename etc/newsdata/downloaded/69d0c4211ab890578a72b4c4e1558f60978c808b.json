It\u2019s really devastating for her and her family that she has gone through it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

(The mother of four was temporarily suspended by the company following the incident while they investigated.)\n\n\u201cPeter Pan has treated her well and has been fair with her. She hopes to return,\u201d he says. \u201cMy belief is that she will.\u201d\n\nA representative for Peter Pan Bus Lines did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.", "description": "Charges Dropped for Peter Pan Bus Driver Who Allegedly Locked Woman", "authors": ["Joelle Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WOuzzHsmXgzkSj1lVVSxXA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MTgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/cdb5d03adae1e953dcdc0b24679d1499", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
