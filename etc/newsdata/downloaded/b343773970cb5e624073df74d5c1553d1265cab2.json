That data shows how interest in the video spread around the world.\n\nBut by this week none of the major websites where terms such as \"bishops teacher\" were trending were hosting the video, and requests on message boards suggested searchers left disappointed.\n\nOne large pornography network, which keeps tracks of searches centrally, said \"fiona viotti\" was its top trending search term across the world.\n\nIn South Africa visitors to one very large free pornography site tried a variety of search terms to find the video.\n\nSimilar attempts to find video of a \"cape town teacher\" showed up on a different large porn site...\n\n... and variations combining \"Viotti\" and \"teacher\" also showed up on a third site.\n\nSearches for the video topped trends for the multi-site porn network in the USA...\n\n... and in Canada...\n\n... while variations of the search trended at several positions in the UK...\n\n... Iran....\n\n.... and Kazakhstan.\n\nBut none of the sites actually featured the video so eagerly sought, and postings on messages boards that specialise in swapping adult content suggested widespread frustration rather than success.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Users in English-speaking countries \u2013\u00a0and the likes of Iran and Kazakhstan \u2013 are still making search terms such as \"bishops video\" and \"bishops teacher\" trend on pornography sites.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9514/d24f7d99cc264fd6bcd091d43888e94b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
