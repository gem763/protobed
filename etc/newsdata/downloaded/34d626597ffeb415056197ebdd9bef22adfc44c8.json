But once the Puma lock was dismissed, England were in complete control.\n\nThey ran in six tries in a performance inspired by the here, there and everywhere style of Jonny May, with successful returns for Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell. But the big talking point came late in the first quarter when Lavanini levelled England captain Owen Farrell with a shoulder to the head.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

And, for the second time in nine days, he was on the end of a red-card challenge. Lavanini will get to know Farrell much better after the World Cup as he is due to join Leicester Tigers in the Premiership. Unfortunately he will now meet his new teammates much sooner than planned.\n\nLavanini can have few complaints about his tackle on Farrell, particularly given that it comes a week after he was lucky to escape action for a shoulder charge on Tonga\u2019s Sione Kalamafoni \u2013 one of his soon-to-be Leicester teammates. With his shoulder smashing into the jaw of Farrell, referee Nigel Owens made himself unequivocally clear.\n\n\"Clear foul play, clear contact with the head,\u201d he said as he watched the replay. \u201cI'm not seeing enough mitigation in my view to avoid a red card.\" And with that, Argentina had 62 daunting minutes to play with 14 men.\n\nBy that point England already had the lead. An early Benjamin Urdapilleta penalty nudged the Pumas in front and saw England handed an early warning for their ill-discipline, with three swift penalty offences coming in as many breakdowns. Their response was emphatic, and felt like it had a message behind it. Having been accused of relying on \u201cboring\u201d rugby by Argentina\u2019s Agustin Creevy, England started the match with a clear intent to attack from all angles \u2013 Ben Youngs taking a tap penalty early and the trio of May, Anthony Watson and Elliot Daly doing the damage.\n\nIt was that trio who brought the first try, with Daly and Watson combining on the right to send the latter away in space. As the ball came from right to left, George Ford weighted a lovely kick to the corner to allow which May chased, forcing full-back Emiliano Boffelli and wing Matias Moroni to carry into touch on the five-metre line.\n\nIt handed England the perfect platform to set-up the driving maul, and with space on the short side, Ford released May to breeze past Urdapilleta and score.\n\nWithin 10 minutes, Argentina were down to 14 and the game effectively was over \u2013 or at least it should have been.\n\nEngland made hard work of their numerical advantage, not least because Farrell couldn\u2019t buy a penalty or conversion for love nor money. Was he suffering from after-effects following the Lavanini hit? After suffering two heavy blows to the head in six days and missing kicks he\u2019d normally have for breakfast, the window was there for the England captain to be removed for at least a head injury assessment.\n\nFarrell would miss two more kicks before half-time, but only because England finally managed to break Argentina down. The first once again came through the back three, with two surging runs from May putting them in position to strike. After Maro Itoje was superbly held up by No 8 Javier Ortega Desio, England abandoned the pick-and-go strategy and went wide, allowing Daly to split Boffelli and Moroni to score.\n\nThe third followed just before half-time, as again a series of short-range drives provided the gap for Ben Youngs to shoot through and score. The Argentina defence up until that point had done supremely well to resist, but at 15-3 down at the break, you sensed the worst for the South Americans.\n\nA Vunipola-less England took little time to add the bonus-point try, with Ford making the most of powerful running from Sam Underhill and Manu Tuilagi to split Boffelli and Moroni again to score in the corner, and finally, Farrell found his boots to kick the conversion, adding a 54th-minute penalty for good measure.\n\nThe Pumas threatened to make a fight of it when a lovely move saw the ball slipped through the hands of replacement fly-half Lucas Mensa, Bautista Delguy, Jeronimo de la Fuente and finally Moroni to speed over for their one and only try, but two late scores from England put the contest to bed, with Jack Nowell returning in style by bumping his way out of contact to score on his first appearance in more than four months, and Luke Cowan-Dickie adding his third try in as many matches through a driving maul.\n\nHis score ended the match \u2013 or rather one final shoving match did. It was an appropriate end to a thoroughly bad-tempered contest. England will nevertheless be pleased with their evening\u2019s work, although they now face an anxious wait on Vunipola\u2019s ankle injury. They need him to be fit for the France clash next week.", "description": "England sealed their place in the Rugby World Cup knockout stage with a match to spare after yet another victory marred by a controversial red card.
