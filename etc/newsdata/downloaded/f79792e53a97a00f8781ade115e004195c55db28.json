Getty 2/17 Yangtze Finless Porpoise Endemic to China's Yangtze River, the Yangtze finless porpoise has an estimated population of 1000-1800 Kenichi Nobusue 3/17 South China Tiger When discovered in the 1950s, the South China tiger population was estimated to be 4000, by 1996 it was estimated to be only 30-80. Scientists consider the tiger to be \"functionally extinct\" as one has not been sighted for over 25 years 4/17 Sumatran Orangutan The Sumatran orangutan was once found across the island of Sumatra and even further south on Java. Today it is found only in the island's north and its population stands at 14,613 Getty 5/17 Western Lowland Gorilla Though it is the most populous of all gorilla subspecies, the western lowland gorilla is still critically endangered and its population has declined by 60% in the last quarter century Getty 6/17 Sumatran Rhinoceros The Sumatran rhinoceros is the smallest of the surviving rhinoceros species. Only 80 are known to be living today. The last male Sumatran rhino in Malaysia died on 28 May 2019 Willem V Strien 7/17 Sumatran Tiger There are fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers left today. They are severely threatened by deforestation and poaching Getty 8/17 Eastern Lowland Gorilla Half of the rainforest of the Democratic Republic of Congo in which these gorillas live has been destroyed the past 50 years. There were 17,000 Eastern Lowland gorillas in the 1990s but scientists estimate their population has declined by over 50% since then Getty 9/17 Vaquita The world's rarest marine animal has a population of only 30.

Scientists have only sighted saola in the wild four times and it is considered critically endangered 12/17 Sumatran Elephant The Sumatran elephant population now stands at only 2400-2800 Getty 13/17 Malayan Tiger The Malayan Tiger population now stands at only 250-300 Getty 14/17 Hawksbill Turtle The population of the Hawksbill Turtle has declined by more than 80% in the last century. They are threatened by black market poachers who kill them for their shell Getty 15/17 Black Rhino The population of the black rhino dropped by 98% in the years 1960-1995 due to poaching, it stands today at around 5000 Getty 16/17 Cross River Gorilla The population of the Cross River gorilla has been damaged by deforestation and poaching, it now stands at 200-300 Julie Langford 17/17 Bornean Orangutan The population of the Bornean orangutan has been reduced by over 50% in the past 60 years, now standing at around 104,700.

Combined with illegal logging, agricultural expansion and new energy and infrastructure projects, the natural habitat of countless creatures is rapidly being permanently destroyed.\n\nIn some cases the accelerated destruction is taking place just as we are becoming aware of what we are losing.\n\nOne fire runs directly through the newly-found marmoset\u2019s range, Mr Ara\u00fajo told charity Flora & Fauna International, citing Nasa satellite data.\n\n\u201cOnce these forests are gone, the marmosets will be gone too,\" he said. \"And this year\u2019s fires are burning much more habitat of all southern Amazonian marmosets than in past years.\u201d\n\nMr Ara\u00fajo added the setting of the fires which have swept through swathes of the Brazillian Amazon this year was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d.\n\nHe said this was not a year of reduced rainfall and drier conditions which increase fire risks.\n\nThe prices of soy crops and beef had not drastically risen to prompt farmers to clear more agricultural land, he added.\n\n\u201cThe obvious conclusion is that the 2019 fires are politically motivated, with farmers supporting the agenda of the president against environment and biodiversity conservation. And the president is in turn supporting these people on the ground,\" he said.\n\nHe said Brazil's right wing president Jair Bolsonaro had \"been systematically dismantling the country\u2019s framework for monitoring and preventing deforestation, cutting the budget of the national environment agency, refusing absolutely vital international support \u2026 and proposing the relaxation of environmental\n\nHowever, he added that the discovery of the new marmoset could have a positive impact by causing a review to be held into the construction of major hydroelectric power plants, which are all within the species\u2019 range.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis region has hardly been studied and its biodiversity is poorly known, so having a new primate species described from there clearly demonstrates that we are destroying the habitat of many other, still undiscovered species.\u201d", "description": "A completely new species of marmoset monkey that was\u00a0discovered just weeks ago, is now believed to be at significant risk due to the fires which continue to burn through the Amazon rainforest.\u00a0 The\u00a0Mico\u00a0munduruku\u00a0marmoset is unusual because of its white tail and hands.
