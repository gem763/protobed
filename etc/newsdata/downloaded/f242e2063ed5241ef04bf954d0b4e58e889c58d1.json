The friends are also managing how HIV intersects with all of this.\n\nThe play\u2019s main female characters, Shawna and Patrice, are mothers to two of the younger men in the play and are trying to support their children, while the community and church reject their sons\u2019 sexuality.\n\nThe production\u2019s title is inspired from an iconic Grace Jones\u2019 lyric \u201cYou kill me for living my life. As much as I can. As black as I am.\u201d The script is based on interviews with hundreds of gay and bisexual men from Jackson, Mississippi, and Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe production\u2014a collaboration between Harley & Co, a NYC-based creative studio, and ViiV Healthcare\u2014uses neon lights and sprinkles of glitter to amplify emotion and exaggerate reality. Each scene shifts in color to create new moods and places. The bedroom is a rich, warm yellow-amber, depicting where characters feel safest. In contrast, the clinic is an icy blue, because characters face stigma regarding their health status at the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nBlack gay and bisexual men are more affected by HIV and face more disparities in treatment than any group in the United States, according to the CDC. In the south, the stakes are even higher. Nearly 44 percent of all people living with an HIV diagnosis in the U.S. live in the south.\n\nSouthern black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately impacted, the CDC reports. African-American men make up at least 54 percent of new HIV diagnoses. The CDC reports that general discomfort around queer sexuality in the south, along with socioeconomic factors like poverty and income inequality, play a role in whether people will seek preventative treatment.\n\nHall said in pop culture black people with HIV are often regulated to the past.\n\n\u201cIt looks at what happened 10 or 20 years ago,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI think that\u2019s misleading, potentially for audiences and doesn\u2019t communicate how present it is and how immediate it is.\u201d She added, \u201cAlso, in many of those shows the actors are white or are not black.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, it\u2019s been hidden and silenced more so in the black community\u2014and it shouldn\u2019t be. It should be equal attention and visibility.\u201d\n\nThe play began from a startling CDC statistic. Three years ago, the CDC revealed that if infection rates don\u2019t change by 2020, one in two black men who have sex with men in America will be infected with HIV in their lifetime.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic hits close to home for Hall. When she was a child, her uncle died with the disease.\n\n\u201cI remember it very vividly him being sick and how scary it was,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was my guardian angel. He helped me go to school in New York, which ended up being theater school and that\u2019s how I connected to the people who are part of the production.\u201d\n\n\u201c Had he been alive he would have been devastated by what\u2019s happening. He would have wanted to fight for all men who are part of the community \u201d\n\nIn honor of her late relative, the actors say her uncle\u2019s name \u201cChuck\u201d in the show.\n\n\u201cHad he been alive he would have been devastated by what\u2019s happening,\u201d Hall said. \u201cHe would have wanted to fight for all men who are part of the community.\u201d\n\nActor Jason Veasy, who plays the pastor, said the production acts as a form of outreach.\n\n\u201cI know so many people in my life who are HIV positive,\u201d Veasy said. \u201cWe know how people can contract the virus, but I don\u2019t think we pay enough attention to stigma and shame. That can directly affect how someone takes care of themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot have these statistics where black gay men are having this level of infection given the standard of care that is available,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWe have to support black gay men.\u201d She added, \u201cThere is no reason that the shame and stigma that exists should be persistent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might be a straight white man who comes to the show, but you can understand how challenging it is to negotiate intimacy with a partner and how power dynamics can be very complicated,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThat can be a way to say, \u2018I understand and have felt these things too.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs Much As I Can is at Joe\u2019s Pub, NYC, Sept. 12 to 16.", "description": "In \u201cAs Much As I Can,\u201d four southern black men rediscover their relationships to faith, friends and community while living with HIV.
