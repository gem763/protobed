They also have big plans for plant-based cheese, sour cream and yogurt.\n\nBut first, they\u2019re out to conquer ice cream.\n\nBowman and Steinhart claim they\u2019ve re-created the texture, taste and functionality of dairy by using plant products to form micelles, \u201cthe magic spheres\u201d that are the molecular structures of milk proteins. But their ice cream\u2019s base ingredients \u2014 which include oat fiber, cane sugar, glucose, canola oil, cassava starch and potato protein \u2014 are less important than the process used to create it, they say.\n\nTinkering with the steps \u2014 how to incorporate the ingredients, and the precise heating, pressurizing and blending \u2014 was the key. \u201cIt enables the functionality that makes it indistinguishable from its animal counterpart,\u201d says Thomas, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes stints as a Michelin-starred chef and director of product development at Just, which makes a plant-based egg substitute that had a similar debut at Equinox.\n\n\n\nThomas Bowman, founder of Eclipse; Brandi Edinger, executive pastry chef at Equinox Restaurant; and Todd Gray, chef at Equinox, create desserts with Eclipse\u2019s plant-based ice cream. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nOther vegan ice creams have claimed to do the same. For example, Perfect Day ice cream has re-created dairy protein by adding a cow DNA \u201cblueprint\u201d to yeast, which ferments and produces milk proteins. That kind of tinkering isn\u2019t cheap: A pint of Perfect Day cost $20 when it was available earlier this year in a limited run.\n\nBowman and Steinhart say their processing does not rely on such expensive biotech and employs the same pasteurization, homogenization and storage that regular dairy products do. \u201cWe\u2019re not reinventing the wheel,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cWe\u2019re just re-creating milk \u2014 without the cow.\u201d\n\nKeeping costs down, they say, is key to making vegan dairy products eventually go mainstream \u2014 along with making sure they are actually, you know, delicious. (Less important to them is making a low-calorie product: \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be the healthiest kid on the block,\u201d says Steinhart, a former tech exec.)\n\nGray, for one, is more than willing to vouch for the product\u2019s taste. He described first getting the ice cream bases (in plain, vanilla and chocolate flavors) into his kitchen and immediately launching into mad-scientist mode, throwing in rhubarb-strawberry jam left over from a brunch service along with some graham crackers. He was so delighted with the result that he immediately drove the concoction across town to the Museum of the Bible, where he operates the restaurants, to show it to pastry chef Brandi Edinger.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You have to taste this stuff \u2014 you won\u2019t believe it,\u2019 \u201d he recalls.\n\nAt last week\u2019s tasting, Gray and Edinger used the Eclipse base to whip up tahini-espresso and Black Forest flavors, the latter of which incorporated chunks of vegan brownies and Morello cherries. Both tasted decidedly dairy-esque: creamy and melty, with no off-notes suggesting there was a lab coat involved in production.\n\nThe chefs also demonstrated just how high-end the base could go, using it to make a domed semifreddo \u2014 a half-frozen dessert with a mousse-like consistency \u2014 spiked with flavors of Sicilian orange and raspberry. That dish, which will be on the restaurant\u2019s menu starting next week, also incorporated aquafaba, the slightly viscous water in cans of chickpeas, which is sometimes used as an egg white substitute. The elegant dessert is as velvety as Jason Momoa\u2019s pink Oscars tuxedo.\n\nGray declared the introduction of the ice cream (as well as the soft-serve versions he doled out at the restaurant\u2019s plant-based Sunday brunch) to be a success, even among his diners who are merely \u201ccurious\u201d about plant-based eating.\n\nAppealing to the masses, not just the small percentage of people who define themselves as vegan, is exactly the point, says Steinhart. \u201cWe have to win them over if we want to create a food system that actually works for the planet and for our future.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nTo David Chang, the \u2018ethnic\u2019 food aisle is racist. Others say it\u2019s convenient.\n\nThe key to White Claw\u2019s surging popularity: Marketing to a post-gender world\n\nWe did it, America.
