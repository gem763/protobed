The 2015 match between Scotland and Australia will always be remembered for the controversial penalty that broke Scottish hearts at the death. But the Wallabies\u2019 35-34 win had everything, including interceptions, a rain storm and eight tries. France\u2019s shock win over the All Blacks in 2007 was pretty special too. That win for Les Bleus in front of their home fans comes in at No 7 in this list of most memorable World Cup moments, also starring David Campese, Jonah Lomu and Nelson Mandela. Meanwhile \u2026 who could forget Jason Robinson\u2019s electrifying run and pass to set up Will Greenwood\u2019s try in England\u2019s 2003 quarter-final win over Wales? That same tournament also provided one of the greatest passes the game has ever seen, from Carlos Spencer to send Joe Rococoko over to score for the All Blacks in their last-eight win against South Africa.\n\n2) Typhoon Hagibis may have eased in time for Japan\u2019s breathtaking win over Scotland, but the cancellation of Italy\u2019s match against the All Blacks denied Sergio Parisse his World Cup swansong at the age of 36. No matter, let\u2019s remember the power, the pace and the personality.\n\nItalrugby (@Federugby) Gli anni passano, ma i momenti trascorsi #insieme rimarranno per sempre \ud83d\udc99\n\n\n\nTanti auguri da tutti noi, Capitano!@sergioparisse #rugbypassioneitaliana pic.twitter.com/vo6Q9TeDBw\n\n3) It\u2019s Manchester United v Liverpool on Sunday, and to whet the appetite here are 10 belters from the past, from a United perspective. Liverpool fans might prefer this compilation of their 10 best Premier League goals at Old Trafford. Danny Murphy features twice! Here Michael Owen and Paul Ince discuss one of football\u2019s great rivalries.\n\n4) What do you do when your teammate makes an interception, spins away from a tackle and bolts 70 yards in the wrong direction towards his own end zone? Drag him down and put the remarkable footage on Twitter of course.\n\nKha\u2019Ron Thrower4 (@SGAndre1) Spots center not top 10 and Top 10???? I saved the game with the tackle, teammate ran the opposite way off the interception\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02@BleacherReport @SportsCenter @houseofhighligh @overtime @ScottVanPeezy @RandyMoss pic.twitter.com/DjSSFy2hTf\n\n5) If you thought that was strange, check out the dexterity shown by this cartwheeling high school footballer. Simone Biles eat your heart out. And is this the most disrespectful thing you\u2019ve seen on a football field?\n\n6) Eliud Kipchoge broke the two-hour barrier for the marathon on Saturday, and afterwards said \u2018anything is possible\u2019. A day later rigid Brigid Kosgei took 81 seconds off Paula Radcliffe\u2019s world marathon record. Here\u2019s Kipchoge crushing the men\u2019s world record in Berlin last year. And watch some mere mortals trying to keep up with his record pace on a running machine, with disastrous consequences.\n\n7) Let\u2019s hear it for the world conker championships \u2026\n\nGuardian sport (@guardian_sport) School of hard knocks: the World Conker Championships pic.twitter.com/DgViaqh4VH\n\nOur favourites from below the line last week\n\n1) Henry Olonga belts out This Is \u2018The Moment\u2019 on The Voice (Australia edition).\n\n2) All 38 goals of Hugo S\u00e1nchez\u2019s goals for Real Madrid in the 1989-90 La Liga season were scored with just one touch.\n\n3) With Bathurst approaching, here\u2019s a great insight into the preparation of the big three marques in the lead up to the 1970 race.\n\n4) Free-kick routine? Pah! There\u2019s only one way to score a free-kick.\n\n5) Hornussen \u2013 the sport of, um, Swiss farmers.\n\nSpotters\u2019 badges: whobroughtoranges, GrahamClayton, Xanthe95\n\nGuardian YouTube football channel\n\nDo subscribe, if you fancy.\n\nGuardian YouTube sport channel\n\nDo subscribe, if you fancy.", "description": "Also featuring classic Manchester United v Liverpool matches, a player running to the wrong end zone and Sergio Parisse", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1d2f637f20bfd5f02f0d65d5505d898d8be832/0_353_5298_3179/master/5298.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6cad6fc3e152d08768aca8e14079086b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
