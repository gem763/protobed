But Judge Marrero called it into question. He said the memos rely on \u201csuppositions, practicalities and public policy\u201d as well as dire pictures of hypothetical scenarios \u2014 and not on an actual case.\n\nEither way, those memos \u2014 themselves interpretations of the Constitution \u2014 do not bind the hands of a local prosecutor such as Mr. Vance. Still, the question of whether a president can face state criminal charges also has never been tested, the judge noted.\n\nThe question could reach the United States Supreme Court\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers quickly appealed Judge Marrero\u2019s decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. Depending on what happens there, the losing side ultimately could try to take the case up to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Department of Justice said on Monday that it planned to weigh in on the case as well.\n\nThat does not mean the high court would agree to take the case. But if it does, it could set a sweeping new constitutional precedent about presidential immunity. Did the framers intend for impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate to be the only vehicle for handling any wrongdoing by the president? Should prosecutors with possible political bias have the unfettered ability to disrupt a presidency? Is no American above the law?\n\nEven if the district attorney wins, the president\u2019s tax returns would not be made public\n\nThe president has fought multiple attempts to obtain copies of his tax returns, which he said during the 2016 campaign that he would make public but has since refused to disclose.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have sued to block attempts by congressional Democrats to access his tax returns and financial records, and by New York lawmakers to release state tax returns to congressional committees. They also successfully challenged a California law requiring presidential primary candidates to release their tax returns.\n\nBut even if Mr. Vance prevails and obtains Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, they would not automatically become public. The documents would be protected by the rules governing grand jury secrecy unless they became part of a criminal case.", "description": "A judge ordered President Trump to turn over eight years of tax returns, but the case raises constitutional issues that could end up in the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Benjamin Weiser", "William K.
