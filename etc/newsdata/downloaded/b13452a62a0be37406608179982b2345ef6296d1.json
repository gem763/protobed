We just had a really hard landing, blew out the tires and brakes have melted. That thing\u2019s not going anywhere.\u2019\n\nFortunately, they weren\u2019t stranded for long as a friend from Minnesota offered to bail them out by allowing the group to board his flight to Riyadh.\n\n\u2018So, over there is a buddy of ours, and he\u2019s got the same type of plane we were on, and he\u2019s going to be graceful enough to let us climb on board and continue the journey,\u2019 Hulk said while pointing the camera at the second plane sitting on the tarmac.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelieved that they were safe and would still be able to attend the Crown Jewel event, Hulk added: \u2018We\u2019re going to make it.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n[It was] quite an experience landing in and all that crazy stuff happening.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s been years since we\u2019ve seen Hulk, real name Terry Bollea, in the boxing ring but there\u2019s a chance he could make a grand return.\n\nThe 66-year-old recently revealed that he wants a \u2018retirement match\u2019 with Vince McMahon at Wrestlemania.\n\nHulk told the LA Times earlier in October: \u2018I talked to Vince, and I said I really don\u2019t know if I could live with myself knowing my last match was with TNA [Total Nonstop Action Wrestling].\n\n\u2018If I can get fixed, I pray I can have one more match.\n\n\u2018I told Vince, \u201cWhen I get through this back surgery, I\u2019m going to get in the best shape of my life and we\u2019re going to talk about me having one last retirement match\u201d.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then, Hulk will next make an appearance at the Crown Jewel, a PPV event, where he will chair a team against one led by Ric Flair on 31 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
