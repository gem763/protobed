That monthly total is still the highest September level since at least 2014, according to CBP statistics.\n\nNew asylum rule to take effect\n\nImmigration has been a central issue for President Donald Trump whose administration has taken a series of escalating measures to curb access to asylum and limit immigration. Many have drawn legal challenges and strong criticism from human rights groups.\n\n190912195200983\n\nIn September, the US Supreme Court allowed a new rule to take effect that could curtail most asylum applications at the border while the legal challenges against it continue.\n\nThe rule would mean most asylum seekers who pass through another country first will be ineligible for asylum at the US's southern border. Morgan said the rule is set to take effect this week.\n\nAnother policy, the Migrant Protection Protocols, has been allowed to move forward temporarily by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. More than 51,000 migrants have been sent back to Mexico since January to await their US asylum hearings.\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to sign deals to accept more asylum seekers closer to home. Few details have been released about when and how the agreements will be implemented.\n\nMany migrants are fleeing transnational gangs that operate in the entire region. Local asylum offices in Central America have few resources to handle a surge of new cases from neighbouring countries.\n\nMexico has so far resisted signing any kind of \"safe third country\" agreement that would force migrants to seek refuge there instead of the US.", "description": "Trump administration official says 'staggering' number of migrants have been arriving to the US-Mexico border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/7/3/1b22f76474234e80947f528c291b85de_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
