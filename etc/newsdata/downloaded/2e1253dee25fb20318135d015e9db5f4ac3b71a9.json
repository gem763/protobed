Yields have an inverse relationship to a bond's price and a negative yield would mean an investor is essentially paying for the privilege of holding a country's sovereign debt. That $15 trillion figure has nearly tripled since October 2018 with an expectation that central banks will continue to support the market with low rates and possible asset purchases.\n\nEl-Erian, a well-known economist for Allianz who used to run investment giant Pimco, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick Friday that the market needed to be looked at in relative terms.\n\n\"You have to think differently about the bond market. We used to think in terms of the bond market as a core allocation. And we went a step further and said: 'You can outperform in bonds as opposed to equities because of all these structural issues'. That's the wrong way to think about the bond market today,\" he said at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy.\n\n\"The bond market today is opportunistic, it is very different from the core allocation to opportunistic. So look for opportunistic positioning. So for today, Argentina today. Is the country in a mess? Yes. But the bonds have overshot.\"", "description": "Economist Mohamed El-Erian told CNBC Friday that investors need to think differently about the global bond market.", "authors": ["Matt Clinch"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103721192-20160615-3190-2177.jpg?v=1567769321", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
