Deadspin was also told that senior ESPN executives were monitoring all shows as they discussed the news of the day.\n\nESPN\u2019s reticence to talk about the massive and endemic human rights violations stands in stark contrast to the network\u2019s all-out support for the NBA\u2019s boycott of North Carolina because of the Tar Heel State\u2019s transgender bathroom law.\n\nESPN\u2019s commentators were entirely unrestrained when attacking North Carolina for being \u201chomophobic\u201d and \u201ctransphobic.\u201d\n\nIn March of 2017 for instance, ESPN host Rachel Nichols insisted that North Carolina\u2019s law aimed at keeping children and women safe in public washrooms was somehow just like the \u201clunch counter\u201d protests during the Civil Rights era. That same month, Nichols also openly advised the NBA to boycott North Carolina.\n\nIn other cases of pandering to transgenderism and radical LGBTQ issues, ESPNW\u2019s Katie Barns routinely supplied stories celebrating the LGBTQ agenda and attacking those that she thought might be in opposition.\n\nThen there was ESPN\u2019s support for outspoken race-baiter Jemele Hill who, for years, used the sports network as a platform to push her radical ideas about \u201csocial justice.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, for instance, ESPN tolerated Hill\u2019s proclamation that the U.S.A. does \u201ceverything possible to undermine the LGBTQ community.\u201d Curiously, never once did Hill mention that China actually jails, tortures, and executes gays there.\n\nWorse, even when an ESPN personality skewed to the right side of the political aisle, the network felt the need to apologize for it.\n\nBack in 2013, ESPN was apoplectic that commentator Chris Broussard dared to express a Christian worldview, and the network felt the need to disavow Broussard for his comments.\n\nIt should also be remembered that back in 2016, ESPN fired legendary Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling over his comments about transgenderism.\n\nDespite that \u201cwoke\u201d history, ESPN is squelching any discussion of the far more real and vicious human rights abuses in China. Perhaps the key is the huge contracts ESPN shares with the NBA?\n\nAccording to New York Business Journal, ESPN has a $2.6 billion deal to broadcast the NBA\u2019s games. Clearly, with the league kowtowing to China\u2019s dictates and refusing to denounce the country over its dismal human rights record, ESPN is taking its cue from its big-dollar business partner. Accusing Americans of evil \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 is fine with this sports network. But the real abuses of the Chinese are off-limits.\n\nThen there is ESPN\u2019s link to parent company Disney which is also up to its neck in ties to Chinese money. Indeed, Disney is so beholden to the Chinese that it felt the need to get China\u2019s approval to buy 21st Century Fox. Disney also operates a lucrative theme park in Shanghai, China.\n\nChinese moviegoers have also figured heavily into Disney\u2019s bottom line. According to the New York Times, for example, Disney\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d earned $614 million in China. Chinese moviegoers purchased an estimated $8.87 billion in tickets alone, in 2018.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "ESPN warned hosts to avoid any political discussion of the relationship between China and Hong Kong, as the NBA continues trying to make", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images-9-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
