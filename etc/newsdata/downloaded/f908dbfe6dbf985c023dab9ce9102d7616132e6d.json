After being forced to flee a new blaze with his family he is hoping not to suffer the same fate again.\n\nLopez is one of more than 180,000 people who have been ordered to evacuate their homes in Sonoma County north of San Francisco because of the wind-fueled \u201cKincade Fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried because of the high winds,\u201d the 36-year-old Lopez told AFP after arriving in Petaluma from Healdsburg, a town of around 11,000 in Sonoma County which is under evacuation orders.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t recovered emotionally from two years ago and economically we were barely getting things back up,\u201d he said.\n\nLopez, a construction worker, said his family had more time to prepare to flee this time \u2014 although not by much.\n\n\u201cWe had an hour to get ready,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way it happened last time, we had to evacuate last minute. It was very tough.\u201d\n\nRicardo Alvarez, also a construction worker, lost his apartment two years ago.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think it would happen again so soon,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kincade Fire has been burning for five days and has destroyed 66,231 acres (26,802 hectares). California\u2019s governor declared a statewide emergency on Sunday.\n\nIn Petaluma, emergency shelters have been set up to house evacuees, many of whom, like Lopez and Alvarez, fled the 2017 fire which left 22 people dead and ravaged an entire neighborhood in the city of Santa Rosa.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to think it\u2019s routine,\u201d said Kathy Amundson, a 67-year-old retiree who fled the town of Windsor with her 90-year-old mother, Joy.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re better prepared but it\u2019s scary each time,\u201d Amundson said.\n\nHer ailing mother is bed-ridden and had been discharged from hospital shortly before they were forced to flee.\n\n\u201cIt was complicated to get my mom in the wheelchair and then into the car,\u201d Amundson said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dance\u2019 \u2013\n\nAdriane Hatkoff, a 70-year-old art teacher for adults, said the evacuation had been \u201cvery orderly\u201d overall.\n\n\u201cIt was like a dance, how they funnel all these people in a way that avoids congestion,\u201d Hatkoff said. \u201cIt was very peaceful. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d\n\nAly Cresci is the secretary of a community center hosting evacuees.\n\n\u201cThis time we had time to plan,\u201d Cresci said. \u201cWe knew who takes care of what, the volunteers, the food\u2026 But it\u2019s weird. I\u2019m having deja vu. I don\u2019t like it. We did it all two years ago.\u201d\n\nThe deadly 2017 fire and another last year which killed 86 people have forced the California authorities to urge people to pay greater heed to evacuation warnings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making sure evacuation is going smoothly and people are taking it seriously,\u201d California Governor Gavin Newsom told AFP during a visit to a shelter in Petaluma.\n\n\u201cAfter five years of historic drought, and an historic rainfall, something is going on,\u201d Newsom said.\n\n\u201cIf people have any doubt around science, climate change, come to California and observe evidence of this reality,\u201d the governor added.\n\nWhile some evacuees are being housed by family or friends, others are in shelters and some are sleeping in their cars.\n\nGordon Stubbe, a 73-year-old retiree who helps out on a sheep ranch in Bodega, fled with his cat, Punk.\n\n\u201cIt was very windy,\u201d Stubbe said. \u201cThere was a lot of ash. All the smoke was blowing right at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a call from the neighbors at three in the morning,\u201d he added. \u201cThe sheep will have to fend for themselves, couldn\u2019t bring them out here.\u201d", "description": "Petaluma (United States) (AFP) \u2013 Elizar Lopez lost his home in California\u2019s devastating wildfires two years ago.
