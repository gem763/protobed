Reuters was the first to report that Harley Davidson had stopped production and deliveries.\n\n\u201cWe recently discovered a non-standard condition during a final quality check; stopped production and deliveries; and began additional testing and analysis, which is progressing well,\u201d HD said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are in close contact with our LiveWire dealers and customers and have assured them they can continue to ride LiveWire motorcycles. As usual, we\u2019re keeping high quality as our top priority.\u201d\n\nHarley Davidson has not said when production and sale could resume, nor did it provide more information on the non-standard condition.\n\nThe production stoppage threatens to derail Harley Davidson\u2019s bet on electrification. The $29,799, 105 horsepower electric motorcycle was to be the first of a future line-up of EVs from HD spanning motorcycles, bicycles and scooters.\n\nThe LiveWire went into production in 2019 after years of hints and even a concept electric motorcycle roadshow. Delivery to dealers began September 27.\n\nThe LiveWire and subsequent EV products are meant to compliment, not replace, Harley Davidson\u2019s premium internal-combustion cruiser motorcycles.\n\nNew motorcycle sales in the U.S., particularly to customers aged under 40, have been in the doldrums since the recession. Harley Davidson\u2019s revenues have dropped over the last decade. HD\u2019s shift to electric motorcycles is a bid to hold down its loyal gas-motorcycle following, while creating products to appeal to millennials and the on-demand mobility market.\n\nThis puts the iconic American company in a position to hedge competition from a crop of e-moto startups \u2014 such as Zero \u2014 and jump out front as the EV leader among established motorcycle companies.\n\nNow that strategy could be hampered by this production halt.", "description": "Harley Davidson has halted production and delivery of its first electric motorcycle, the LiveWire, after discovering what the\u00a0Milwaukee-based manufacturer described as a non-standard condition.
