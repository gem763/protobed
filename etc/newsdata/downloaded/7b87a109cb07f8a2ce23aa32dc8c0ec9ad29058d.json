REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo\n\nThe company last week unveiled three iPhone models featuring upgraded processors and new camera functionality, including iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, priced between $699 and $1,099.\n\nCNBC quoted TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, known as a close follower of the Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s supply chains, as saying that demand for new iPhones is beating his expectations \u2013 and that much of it was due to Chinese consumers.\n\nGreater China was the third biggest region in terms of sales in 2018 and after raising alarms after slack sales growth earlier this year, Apple has seen bumps in demand driven by discounting by Chinese online retailers.\n\nChinese e-commerce site JD.com on Saturday said on its official Weibo account that day one pre-sales for the iPhone 11 series jumped 480% versus the previous year, with the top three most popular products being the iPhone 11 Pro in midnight green, and the standard iPhone 11 in black and purple.\n\nChinese media outlet Yicai also said on Monday that they jumped 335% on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platform on the first day of sales vs pre-sales for the iPhone XR last year, citing Tmall figures.\n\nCNBC said that Kuo had boosted his forecast for iPhone 11 series shipments from between 65 million and 70 million units in 2019 to between 70 million and 75 million units.\n\nWhile giving numbers that did not compare directly with Kuo\u2019s, analysts at two other brokerages also said that the initial orders were looking good.\n\nInstinet, owned by Japanese bank Nomura, cited \u201cshipment\u201d checks for its conclusions, while Wedbush\u2019s Daniel Ives said he had conducted supplier checks throughout Asia including China.\n\n\u201cWe are careful about extrapolating first weekend\n\ndata, though it is fair to say it is ahead of last year\u2019s launches,\u201d Instinet analysts wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cShould the early shipment time data hold and translate to unit volumes, Apple may be able to offset this year\u2019s average selling price reduction,\u201d they added.\n\nApple shares were trading marginally higher around midday in New York compared to an almost half-percent fall for the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.", "description": "Pre-orders for Apple Inc's latest iPhones have gotten off to a better start than the last cycle a year ago, several Wall Street analysts said on Monday, citing their own research data.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430538140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1BS", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
