I respect his team. I told you, he\u2019s a very tough guy. This is huge experience for me.\n\n\u201cRight now, I understand I need more. Focus is boxing. This was a tough fight. I need a little bit more. I need to still get stronger in my camp. Just more serious. I need to work hard. I need a little bit more focus.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s bad day for me, it\u2019s a huge day for Sergiy, his team. This is huge experience for me. Right now I know what I need exactly. I lost a little bit of focus.\n\n(Image: USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cSergiy was ready, I really respect him. He showed me such a big heart. I told him, Sergiy, this is best fight for me. It\u2019s a huge experience. It\u2019s maximum destroy. I just respect his team.\u201d\n\nAsked about his future plans, Golovkin revealed he would be open to a rematch but also called for a third showdown with Canelo Alvarez.\n\nHe added: \u201cRematch? Absolutely. Big fight for DAZN, for the people, of course I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m a boxer, I\u2019m ready for anything.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely I still want Canelo, I\u2019m just open to anybody. There are so many great champions here. Sergiy, a lot of guys. Everything is ready, just call Canelo. If he says yes, let\u2019s do it.\u201d", "description": "Gennady Golovkin edged a thriller against Sergiy Derevyachenko but still received a frosty reception from some fans", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Usa Today Sports"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20491379.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GGGJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
