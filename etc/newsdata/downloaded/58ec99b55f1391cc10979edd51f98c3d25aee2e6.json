REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nU.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that will hear from Muilenburg on Wednesday, said in a written statement that the committee\u2019s lengthy investigation into the MAX has turned up significant questions about Boeing\u2019s decision-making.\n\n\u201cSomething went drastically wrong, a total of 346 people died, and we have a duty to fix it,\u201d DeFazio will say in his opening statement.\n\nDeFazio said the panel is aware of \u201cat least one case where a Boeing manager implored the then-Vice President and General Manager of the 737 program to shut down the 737 MAX production line because of safety concerns.\u201d Boeing did not comment Tuesday on the allegation.\n\nMuilenburg on Tuesday acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on a key safety system known as MCAS before the crashes, as well as for taking months to disclose that it had made optional an alarm that alerts pilots to a mismatch of flight data on the 737 MAX.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes and we got some things wrong. We\u2019re improving and we\u2019re learning,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hearing, the highest-profile congressional scrutiny of commercial aviation safety in years, heaps pressure on a newly rejiggered Boeing senior management team fighting to repair trust with airline customers and passengers shaken by an eight-month safety ban on its 737 MAX following the crashes, which killed 346 people.\n\n\u201cYou have told me half-truths over and over again,\u201d Senator Tammy Duckworth told Muilenburg, questioning why the manufacturer did not disclose more details about MCAS\u2019s lack of safeguards.\n\nTaking turns to grill Muilenburg during his first appearance at a hearing on Capitol Hill in the year since the first crash in Indonesia, senators suggested Boeing had not been completely honest and expressed dismay that the 2016 instant messages did not prompt an immediate reaction from the company.\n\nFor months, Boeing had largely failed to acknowledge blame, instead vowing to make a \u201csafe plane safer.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s hearing represents Boeing\u2019s broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes but Muilenburg stopped short of what some lawmakers and family members had sought.\n\nFamily members were seated just three rows behind Muilenburg during his testimony and were invited at one point to stand and show large photos of their loved ones.\n\nNadia Milleron, whose daughter was killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March, said Muilenburg and the board should resign for failing to do more to prevent the crashes.\n\nAs Muilenburg departed the hearing, she implored him to look at the victims\u2019 families when he apologized. He turned to her and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "description": "Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will face a second day of questions Wednesday from U.S. lawmakers on its now grounded 737 MAX after sharp criticism at a Senate hearing Tuesday.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446489392&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0NM", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
