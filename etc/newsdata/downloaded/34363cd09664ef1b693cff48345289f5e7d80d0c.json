Still, \u201cSlave Play\u201d feels like a challenging evening for audiences of every background. It\u2019s also a highly entertaining one \u2014 the kind of communal experience that permits you to laugh, even as it helps you out of your own myopic corner. It lets you consider lowering your defenses, so that you can really listen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRarely does Broadway allow for the tenderest nerves in American identity politics to be rubbed so rawly. Harris is a playwright of excess: If there is a choice between more words, or fewer, he dependably goes for more. (The show runs a little over two hours without an intermission.) Yet what he builds here under Robert O\u2019Hara\u2019s excellent direction, in three distinct and surprising sections, is a triptych of the quintessential American problem \u2014 one to which you could easily devote twice as many words.\n\n\u201cOkay, partners,\u201d says one of the comically earnest therapists in the evening\u2019s lengthy second part. \u201cSo let\u2019s process.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s process, indeed. \u201cSlave Play\u201d derives its provocative title from its shocking initial chapter. Three scenes \u2014 often carnally explicit \u2014 unfold, each around an interracial couple. The linkage is they\u2019re all set in the pre-Civil War South, and involve a psychosexual power game between an enslaved black person and a white Southerner. (Whips sometimes come out, and so do demonstrations of domination and submission.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is an audience to make of these discomfiting encounters? Since the play\u2019s debut late last year at off-Broadway\u2019s New York Theatre Workshop, Harris, O\u2019Hara and their exemplary cast have made the underpinnings of these vignettes a bit less enigmatic \u2014 we are allowed now to intuit that they may not be exactly what they seem. And of course, they aren\u2019t. Clint Ramos\u2019s gleaming set design reinforces the notion of being asked to look with crystal clarity at one\u2019s sense of self: It\u2019s a wall of mirrors.\n\nIn part two, the self-reflection is both elucidated and parodied: We\u2019re at the midpoint of a week-long self-actualization retreat, where the three couples are submitting to a regimen risibly titled \u201cAntebellum Sexual Performance Therapy.\u201d The black partners in each couple, it seems, are seeking help because they no longer achieve meaningful intimacy with their white partner. The therapists (portrayed by Chalia La Tour and Irene Sofia Lucio) egg on escalating confrontations between Gary (Ato Blankson-Wood) and Dustin (James Cusati-Moyer); Phillip (Sullivan Jones) and Alana (Annie McNamara); and Kaneisha (Joaquina Kalukango) and Jim (Paul Alexander Nolan).\n\nOne of the acutely observed currents of \u201cSlave Play\u201d is that though the therapy is supposed to focus on the African American characters, the white characters won\u2019t shut up. It\u2019s a demonstration of the failure to receive information, and maybe why the sex doesn\u2019t work. The Caucasians continually resist being characterized by their black lovers. Cusati-Moyer\u2019s terrific Dustin, for instance, hilariously objects when a rather obvious racial label is applied to him. \u201cI am not white!\u201d he protests. \u201cIt\u2019s erasure!\u201d Dustin doesn\u2019t realize how absurd his declaration sounds to Gary, in Blankson-Wood\u2019s perfectly pitched portrait of anguished exhaustion. Making allowances for the self-delusions of the righteously \u201cgood\u201d white people seems finally to have defeated him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe actors all navigate with el\u00e1n the tricky border of psychological realism and satire. Even Jones\u2019s strong-but-silent Phillip creates a vivid comic character; McNamara\u2019s Alana, meantime, is a superb manifestation of neurotic solipsism. During the play\u2019s final section, we\u2019ll discover, thrillingly, that the seeming ridiculousness of antebellum sex therapy is not by any stretch meaningless (though La Tour and Lucio skillfully and somewhat cartoonishly send up the data-dependent appetites of ambitious academics).\n\nIt\u2019s in that persuasive finale, devoted to the tormented exasperation of Kalukango\u2019s sublimely rendered Kaneisha, that we get the stunning truth of what her character is after \u2014 and that only Nolan\u2019s expertly, intuitively constructed Jim can help her through. It is, in a cosmic sense, what \u201cSlave Play\u201d is after, too. I cannot reveal to you what that catharsis is. I can just tell you that \u201cSlave Play\u201d delivered one to me \u2014 and in the process opened my eyes and ears more fully, and gratefully.\n\nSlave Play, by Jeremy O. Harris.
