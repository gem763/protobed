REUTERS/Temilade Adelaja/File Photo\n\nABUJA (Reuters) - Shares of MTN Nigeria (MTNN.LG) hit a three-month high on Friday after the telecoms company\u2019s offices partially reopened following a shutdown due to anti-South African attacks in the West African country.\n\nThe local units of South Africa\u2019s MTN Group (MTNJ.J) and supermarket chain Shoprite (SHPJ.J), closed all stores and service centres in Nigeria after their premises were attacked following days of riots in their home country chiefly targeting foreign-owned, including Nigerian, businesses.\n\nThe violence in South Africa has strained relations between Africa\u2019s two biggest economies, with Nigeria saying on Thursday it would recall its top diplomat to Pretoria.\n\nMTN Nigeria said its stores remained closed on Friday but skeletal office operations were resuming, its spokesman said, adding that staff were asked to stay at home for safety reasons.\n\nShoprite stores remained shut except for one in an upmarket area of the capital Abuja, a manager there said.\n\nShares in MTN, Nigeria\u2019s second-biggest listed firm, rose 5.03% to 139.80 naira each, a level last seen in June. Johannesburg-listed Shoprite shares were up 1.8%.\n\nPrior to the shutdown, the telecoms firm last week launched a mobile money transfer service, targeting Nigerians without bank accounts, and said it planned to become a payment services bank once it obtains approval from the central bank.", "description": "Shares of MTN Nigeria hit a three-month high on Friday after the telecoms company's offices partially reopened following a shutdown due to anti-South African attacks in the West African country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426890047&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF85111", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
