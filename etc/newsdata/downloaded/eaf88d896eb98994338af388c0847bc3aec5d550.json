So much so that musicians such as Zahara promised to help them make it in the entertainment industry, should they not be successful in the competition.\n\nNow, Virginia and Viggy Qwabe are out of the competition after a dramatic exit that led to multiple rumours on social media.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Idols SA' shocker: Viggy withdraws after her twin sister Virginia gets eliminated\n\nIf there was ever a time for an industry veteran to lend a helping hand, it is now. DJ Tira was not afraid to step in and offer assistance to the talented twins.\n\nTaking to Twitter, Tira wrote that he wants to work with the sisters \u201cvery soon\u201d.\n\n\u201cI need the twins at Afrotainment studios...,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nFans of the twins immediately responded, with many thinking this meant Tira wants to sign the singers from KwaZulu-Natal but, according to him, this is not the case.\n\nSpeaking to DRUM, Tira cleared up the misunderstanding. He expressed that he believes the Qwabe twins are very talented and that he wants to help them if he can.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an interest in signing them, but I want to help them on their journey in the music industry. I would like to contribute to their journey in the industry, whether we do a song or two together.\u201d\n\nHowever, the twins\u2019 fans expressed concern that this is a publicity stunt for the already successful producer.\n\nTira responded by explaining that he has worked with many KZN artists and that he doesn\u2019t do things just to please other people or seek attention.\n\n\u201cI think I am well-known, and my work speaks for itself. I work with talent, I help talent and I move on.\u201d", "description": "DJ Tira is not afraid to step in and offer assistance to the talented twins,Virginia and Viggy Qwabe after a dramatic exit that led to multiple rumours on social media.", "authors": ["Mbalenhle Zuma"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9509/41e828121f0847cf98d0001c8e6260c3.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
