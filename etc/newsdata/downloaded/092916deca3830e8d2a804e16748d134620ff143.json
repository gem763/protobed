(AP) - Bills tight end Lee Smith makes a distinction when it comes to overconfidence and Buffalo preparing to face the winless Miami Dolphins.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there can be overconfidence, not to me personally,\u201d Smith said Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between being overly confident in yourself and under-estimating an opponent. And we sure as hell aren\u2019t going to be under-estimating any opponent.\u201d\n\nSo long as the Bills (4-1) - off to their best start since Smith\u2019s rookie season in 2011 - focus on their preparation and ignore the outside noise of the 0-5 Dolphins and Buffalo being 16\u00bd-point favorites, then everything should turn out fine.\n\n\u201cThat would be my sentiment to you and young players and everyone that looks at a 4-1 start and thinks we\u2019ve arrived,\u201d Smith added. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we feel in this locker room. We feel like we need to go 1-0, prepare for the Dolphins, just like we have every other week.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s response in many ways mirrors the culture of confidence Sean McDermott has sought to foster in the Bills three years into his tenure. For a team that\u2019s made the playoffs just once (McDermott\u2019s first season) in 19 years, he wants his players to have every expectation to win each time they step on the field without getting too far ahead of themselves.\n\n\u201cRecords don\u2019t matter in this league,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cWe respect every opponent. And I\u2019ve stressed from Day 1, we have to continue to improve.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an approach that particularly applies to this week with Buffalo having the luxury of coming off its bye week, and heavily favored against a Dolphins team being already written off as a pushover.\n\nMiami is changing quarterbacks once again with former Bills starter Ryan Fitzpatrick taking over for Josh Rosen. Fitzpatrick will oversee an offense that ranks 30th or worse in most every statistical category. And the Dolphins have been outscored by a combined margin of 180-42.\n\nBills players - from 15-year veteran running back Frank Gore, to rookie defensive tackle Ed Oliver - insist they\u2019ve bought into McDermott\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at no record. It\u2019s an NFL team,\u201d Gore said of the Dolphins, for whom he played for last season. \u201cI\u2019m worrying about where I\u2019m at now. It\u2019s Buffalo, man.\u201d\n\nAnother former Dolphins player, defensive tackle Jordan Phillips dismissed the buzz by suggesting the Bills are the one who lack respect.\n\n\u201cThe only people that know we\u2019re good are in this locker room, so we\u2019re in the same boat as (Miami),\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re 0-5 damn near, so there\u2019s no overconfidence.\u201d\n\nPhillips then shrugged when informed the point spread favoring Buffalo is the largest since 1993.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see when it comes to Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe Bills have a track record of collapsing after encouraging starts, having missed the playoffs in 2008 and \u201811, the past two times they\u2019ve opened 4-1.\n\nSmith is in his second stint in Buffalo and was part of a 2011 Bills\u2019 team that eventually got off to a 5-2 start before losing eight of its final nine games. He saw no reason to reflect back because what happened eight years ago won\u2019t make a lick of difference on this season, or this weekend for that matter.\n\n\u201cYou can compare this and compare that, but at the end of the day, 2019 Bills football is all I\u2019m thinking about, and going 1-0 this week,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying being 4-1, just like I did then. But there\u2019s no part of me thinking negatively like \u2018Oh, man, I\u2019ve been here before and it didn\u2019t work out,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cThree, four, five years from now, when I\u2019m retired and laying around with my wife, I\u2019ll get back to you and make a comparison to the two years.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Backup RB Devin Singletary practice fully and is in line to return after missing three games with a left hamstring injury. \u2026 QB Josh Allen practiced fully despite being listed as having a hand injury. \u2026 TE Tyler Kroft practice fully for the first time since hurting his left ankle four weeks ago. Kroft also missed all the offseason recovering from a broken right foot.\n\n___\n\nNFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bills tight end Lee Smith makes a distinction when it comes to overconfidence and Buffalo preparing to face the winless Miami Dolphins.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/bills_titans_football_75334_c0-228-5472-3420_s1200x700.jpg?f89739662670662341638fe34403095f75f3e118", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
