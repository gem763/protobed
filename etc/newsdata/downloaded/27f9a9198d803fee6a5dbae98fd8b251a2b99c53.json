That was it. No team picked him up for the stretch run.\n\nYoung had a couple workouts but also did not find a team willing to sign him this season, either.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIs he done as an NBA player? Young told Compex that if he doesn\u2019t get a contract this season, at age 34, he can read the writing on the wall and will retire.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty much like my last year, if nothing happened,\u201d says Young. \u201cI\u2019m just going to call it, it\u2019s over. No more Swaggy P.\u201d\n\nTwo seasons ago, Young won a title playing with \u2014 but not exactly fitting in with \u2014 the Warriors. Before that, he was one of the designated gunners on some struggling Lakers teams. Young is entertaining, but he\u2019s not exactly a classic NBA role player who fits in and goes at it hard on defense. Young is going to be Young.\n\nYoung is still tabloid fodder from when he dated Iggy Azalea, and now he\u2019s got a new podcast (doesn\u2019t everyone?). He\u2019s busy. Just probably not playing in the NBA busy anymore.", "description": "It is highly unlikely he gets picked up this season.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6hGgOzUPDIoF_Wp6S.DgkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjQuOTU1NzUyMjEyMzg5NA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YvbWXhQXXNqJBsIGq0rtpg--~B/aD0zODQ7dz02Nzg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/ccd7ff30d1b48635e297a7ed3839d05b", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
