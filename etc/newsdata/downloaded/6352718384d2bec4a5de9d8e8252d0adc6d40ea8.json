Businesses were encouraged to close early.\n\n\"We do not want the citizens of Halifax roaming downtown as the water is coming in,\" said Erica Fleck, assistant chief of community risk reduction in Halifax, the provincial capital and home to 400,000 people.\n\nA crane toppled and crashed into the side of a downtown apartment building under construction. In the city's south end, a roof was ripped off an apartment complex, and firefighter Jeff Paris said several apartment buildings were being evacuated. With the collapsed crane and all the down trees and power lines, it's fortunate there are no significant injuries or deaths, he said.\n\nAn unidentified man raises his arms in the winds from Hurricane Dorian along the Halifax harbor in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, on Saturday, Sept. 7, 2019.

The storm's worst damage in the U.S. appeared to be on Ocracoke Island, which even in good weather is accessible only by boat or air and is popular with tourists for its undeveloped beaches. Longtime residents who waited out the storm described strong but manageable winds followed by a wall of water that flooded the first floors of many homes and forced some to await rescue from their attics.\n\n\"We're used to cleaning up dead limbs and trash that's floating around,\" said Ocracoke Island resident and business owner Philip Howard. \"But now it's everything: picnic tables, doors, lumber that's been floating around.\"\n\nTree branches block a street in Halifax, Nova Scotia as Hurricane Dorian approaches on Saturday, Sept. 7, 2019.

He raised his home higher than the 1944 flood level and still got water inside.\n\n\"It's overwhelming,\" said Howard, who owns the Village Craftsmen, a store that sells handcrafted pottery, glass and kitchen items. He said much of the merchandise on the lower shelves is ruined. Pieces of pottery were floating around inside.\n\nInside his house, the floorboards were buckling and curling up after being warped by the water, he said.\n\nOcracoke Volunteer Fire Department chief Albert O\u2019Neal, in blue shirt, boats down Sunset Drive on his way to seek out islanders stranded in their flooded homes in the aftermath of Hurricane.
