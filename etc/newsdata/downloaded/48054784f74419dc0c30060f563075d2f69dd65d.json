Cove / Splash News)\n\nShe will then have to return to the same court next month to hear whether she will be made bankrupt.\n\nMr Taylor from JMW Solicitors told the judge he had been in email contact with Price in the last two and a bit weeks, but she had failed to attend an appointment with her creditors.\n\n\"Technically it\u2019s not an adjournment so I'm extending time,\" said Judge Barber.\n\n\"Service will be effective on the expiry of seven days of completion of such sending of the email and such posting.\n\n(Image: officialkatieprice/Instagram)\n\n\"Once you've done both, service will be effective on the expiry of seven days.\n\n\"I also extend the time for hearing the bankruptcy petition - I think six weeks.\"\n\nPrice will return to the insolvency court on on November 27.\n\nA spokesman for HMRC, which is believed to be one of Katie's creditors, said they would not comment on individual cases.\n\nIn recent months, Katie has splurged on holidays abroad, home renovation projects and multiple rounds of plastic surgery, which she hinted she was getting for a reduced rate or for free in exchange for Instagram exposure of the clinic in question.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nJust last week, Katie was slapped with a two-year driving ban for failing to tell police who was behind the wheel of her notorious pink Range Rover after a boozy night out last October.\n\nThe Barbie pink 4x4 was found crashed in a hedge with Price in the passenger seat wearing just a hoodie and socks and no underwear.\n\nAt her court case, she insisted a mystery male friend of her partner Kris Boyson had been driving at the time of the crash but had run off before officers arrived.\n\nShe was cleared of drink-driving but convicted of being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle, handed a fine and a three-month ban.\n\nPrice was taken back to court last week where she was found guilty of failing to give police information about the driver when required.\n\nThe two-year ban means she won't be allowed back behind the wheel until October 2021.", "description": "Mum of five Katie Price is being told to return to court in November to hear whether she'll be made bankrupt", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Brett D.
