Inter have one point.\n\n\u201cThis is a very valuable victory for us against a direct rival,\u201d Suarez told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe were aware that if we continued playing like we had in the first half we could lose but the key thing was we stayed patient and were able to create chances.\u201d\n\nConte conceded a goal after three minutes in his last game at the Camp Nou as Chelsea coach in 2018 but this time it was his side who struck an early blow.\n\nInter forward Alexis Sanchez found a hole in his former side\u2019s defence with a superb through ball into the path of Martinez, who raced into the box and slid to the floor to send a shot flying past Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.\n\nConte\u2019s side did not look to sit on their goal and outplayed Barca in the first half, holding on to possession for long periods while doggedly pressing the hosts and picking them off on the counter-attack with ease.\n\nIt took a superb save from Ter Stegen to prevent Lautaro scoring again with a header, while Italian midfielder Stefano Sensi flashed a shot narrowly over the bar.\n\n\u201cInter are very powerful when they are given space and it\u2019s no coincidence that they are top of their league, but we took a step forward in the second half and had more control of the play,\u201d said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde.\n\nBarca were facing their first home defeat in the Champions League group stage since losing to Rubin Kazan in 2009 but were transformed after coach Ernesto Valverde replaced Sergio Busquets with Arturo Vidal.\n\nUNSTOPPABLE VOLLEY\n\nThe Chile midfielder was given the freedom to roam forward and provided the cross from which Suarez scored his unstoppable volley, which appeared to demoralise Inter while galvanising Barca, who were worthy winners in the end.\n\n\u201cWe had control with Busquets, Arthur and Frenkie de Jong but we needed to get closer to their area, we managed to do that in the end and it\u2019s because of that they we were able to create better chances and win the game,\u201d added Valverde.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nConte, meanwhile, rued his side not making the most of their outstanding performance in the first half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to receive compliments after a performance like that but we deserved much more from the game,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe proved we could cause Barca real problems but it\u2019s a shame we couldn\u2019t take our chances and kill the game.\u201d", "description": "Luis Suarez scored two classy goals to inspire Barcelona to a 2-1 comeback win over Inter Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday and inflict a first defeat on Antonio Conte since he took charge of the Italians.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436406185&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911UZ"}
