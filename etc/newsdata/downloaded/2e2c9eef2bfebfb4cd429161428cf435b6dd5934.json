We will meet again on Monday to give the UK another opportunity to present its proposals in detail.\n\n\"We will continue to debrief the European Parliament and the Council, in line with our transparency policy.\n\n\"The Commission will debrief the Council Working Party this afternoon. Michel Barnier debriefed [EU member state ambassadors] yesterday, where member states agreed that the UK proposals do not provide a basis for concluding an agreement.\"\n\nIt comes after Brussels hardened its rhetoric against the latest plan from Westminster on Thursday, warning that it is up to the UK, not the EU, to fix \"problematic\" aspects of it before negotiations can start in earnest.\n\nAsked whether Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay was right to say that the ball was \"in the EU's court\" following the release of the proposals, a spokesperson for the European Commission said the EU would not be left \"holding the bag\" and that it was the UK that needed to act.\n\n\"We would disagree.\" she told reporters in Brussels. \"There are, as we have said, problematic points in the United Kingdom's proposal and further work is needed \u2013 but that work needs to be done by the United Kingdom and not the other way around.\n\n\"We would remind you that it's the UK leaving the European Union and not the EU leaving the UK.\n\n\"We are doing everything in our power to ensure that exit is on an orderly basis and we are willing to engage constructively with our counterparts. But we are not going to be the ones left holding the bag, the ball, or any other kind of object.\"", "description": "European Union member states have agreed that the government's new Brexit proposals \"do not provide a basis for concluding an agreement\", a European Commission spokesman has said.", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/20/11/urn-publicid-ap.org-6c7978b76c1b4d3da9e3822f496955ec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
