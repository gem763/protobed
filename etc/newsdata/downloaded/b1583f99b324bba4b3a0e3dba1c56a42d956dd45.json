The days of buffet-style politics are no longer allowed. You either check all the boxes of the \u2018good\u2019 party, or you belong to the \u2018bad\u2019 one. When I dared to push back by writing articles, I was struck by how quickly the left rejected me. Millions noticed this too: they watched in stunned silence as leftists demanded books be censored, scrutinized language and called anyone who disagreed a Nazi.\n\nFlash forward three years into a Trump administration and instead of learning from mistakes, the loudest members of the party are heading for the same brick wall. At this point the 2020 Democratic platform feels like a barely veiled threat: \u2018Vote for us or you\u2019re racist.\u2019\n\nThe progressive push to fully embody the promise made in the Declaration of Independence that \u2018all men are created equal\u2019 used to feel aspirational and attainable. Now, the open-mindedness and tolerance that attracted me to the Democratic party seems like a thing of the past. Gone is the party that stood in direct opposition to the rigid moralizing of conservatism.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bridget Phetasy", "Spectator.Us Open-Letter-Democratic-Party"], "top_image": ""}
