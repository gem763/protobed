Off our streets!\u201d\n\nThe event held at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario, featured People\u2019s Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier, a Member of Parliament, who appeared with U.S. conservative YouTube host Dave Rubin.\n\nAlthough antifa defenders described the episode as a few bad apples ruining it for the otherwise peaceful protesters \u2014 and blasted those using the video for \u201cpropaganda\u201d purposes \u2014 the episode spurred an antifa backlash, judging by the outraged reaction in the media and social media.\n\n\u201cAntifa\u2019s granny-bullying is another hit to the group\u2019s crumbling public fa\u00e7ade,\u201d said the Monday headline on a column in the Post Millennial of Quebec.\n\nDavid Turkoski, a martial-arts instructor in Brantford, Ontario, later identified the white-haired woman as his mother and posted a video on Twitter with her response to the protest.\n\n\u201cFree speech is a cornerstone of our democracy, and can never \u2014 and will never \u2014 be denied,\u201d said the woman, identified by the CBC as 81-year-old Dorothy Marston.\n\nMy mom prevented from going into a free speech lecture by thugs in Hamilton Ontario Sunday . pic.twitter.com/pAAkrTEUq3 \u2014 David Turkoski (@DTurkoski) October 1, 2019\n\n\n\nIf you look at the chatter online by antifa supporters & leaders, they\u2019re upset by the video of the militants bullying the elderly couple\u2014but only because of the bad press it generated. https://t.co/NNYDQY6lWa \u2014 Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) October 1, 2019\n\n\n\nMr. Bernier retweeted the video and thanked the woman for \u201cstanding up for free speech!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need courageous people like you if we are to keep our country STRONG and FREE,\u201d said Mr. Bernier, who blasted the \u201cAntifa thugs.\u201d\n\nThese Antifa protesters are a small minority of violent thugs.\n\n\n\nThe most frightening is that their extremist, Far Left ideology is now tacitly supported by many in academia, the media, activist organizations, and politics.\n\n\n\nOur democracy is in danger. https://t.co/umcGgthHnJ \u2014 Maxime Bernier (@MaximeBernier) September 30, 2019\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Rubin praised \u201cthe lovely woman who antifa tried to stop from attending my event with @MaximeBernier on Sunday. I now proclaim her to be Canada\u2019s Grandma,\u201d adding that the video had received seven million views.\n\nFormer Canadian Ambassador to Israel Vivian Bercovici tweeted, \u201cI don\u2019t support targeted party, but these thugs have no idea what real fascism is.\u201d\n\nIn a Monday op-ed, Don Henderson of Hamilton said he attended the event with his mother, but that a black-masked activist \u201cdecided to scream as loudly as possible in her ear that she was a Nazi.\u201d\n\nHe said the irony of the incident was that his grandfather fought Nazis during World War II in England, Italy, France and Germany, \u201cunlike these misguided youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Nazi. My family gave everything to stop them and I would do the same,\u201d Mr. Henderson said. \u201cIf you need to wear a mask when you assault people, who exactly are you?\u201d\n\nRead the account of the man who was stopped by Antifa thugs when crossing the street with his mother, at our Hamilton event with @RubinReport.\n\n\n\nAntifa *are* the fascists.https://t.co/Mzv5co8idT \u2014 Maxime Bernier (@MaximeBernier) October 1, 2019\n\n\n\nKojo Damptey, program manager for the Hamilton Centre for Civic Inclusion, told the CBC that he disagreed with harassing \u201cold folks and people that have disabilities,\u201d but that the focus on the elderly couple was a \u201cdistraction.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf they weren\u2019t allowed to speak at Mohawk, that wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d\n\nThis is absolutely not what anti-fascism looks like, but how the far-right needs to paint it to go mainstream themselves. An alt-right neo-Nazi account (and an obvious one) is now going viral for its video and ia being boosted by RT by the likes of Rubin and Ngo. \u2014 Evan Balgord (@ebalgord) September 30, 2019\n\n\n\nFour people were arrested for \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d at the Mohawk College event, although Hamilton police said more could be arrested as the department reviews video from the protest, according to the CBC.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
