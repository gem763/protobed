That\u2019s compared to an estimated 17% of non-LGBTQ adults.\n\nThe finding, part of a larger poll of 2,237 people that measured LGBTQ voters\u2019 demographic characteristics and political attitudes, came as LGBTQ rights have taken center stage in the national conversation. Meanwhile, Friday marked National Coming Out Day.\n\nSome LGBTQ voters already face an uphill battle making their voices heard at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cVoter suppression has primarily targeted voters of color, who also happen to include LGBTQ Americans, who far too often face disproportionate barriers in accessing their right to vote,\u201d Human Rights Campaign president Alphonso David told the Washington Post after HRC, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBTQ rights, backed a voting-rights initiative led by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.\n\nFor instance, David said, voter-ID laws in some states requiring that a person\u2019s documentation match their birth-assigned gender could preclude a transgender person from casting a ballot. While about 137,000 transgender people who had transitioned in the U.S. were eligible to vote ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, more than half might not have had documentation or ID that correctly reflected their gender, the Williams Institute found in August 2018.\n\nHalf of the LGBTQ adults registered to vote next November said they were Democrats, 22% were independents and 15% were Republicans.\n\nWith that said, almost 9 million LGBTQ adults are eligible and registered to vote next November, according to the most recent poll, which was conducted by Ipsos in collaboration with the Williams Institute and Thomson Reuters. Half said they were Democrats, while 22% were independents and 15% were Republicans.\n\nThe sample included 136 registered LGBTQ voters and 1,836 registered non-LGBTQ voters.\n\nLGBTQ rights feature in the 2020 presidential race\n\nThe Williams Institute analysis comes ahead of a high-stakes election in which civil-rights protections for LGBTQ people could hang in the balance.\n\nThe Equality Act, a bill that would shield LGBTQ individuals from discrimination in credit, housing, employment and a range of other areas, passed earlier this year in the Democrat-led House. Activists believe that turning the Republican-led Senate blue in 2020 would boost the bill\u2019s chances of being signed into law.\n\nMany leading Democrats vying for the 2020 nomination \u2014 including former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, the only openly gay candidate running \u2014 have thrown their support behind the Equality Act. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has also proposed abolishing the filibuster to clear a path for the Equality Act\u2019s passage, should Senate Republicans block it.\n\n\u2018LGBT voters differ from non-LGBT voters in several ways. For example, they are more likely to be young, male, and live in urban areas.\u2019 \u2014 study author Christy Mallory, the Williams Institute\u2019s state and local policy director\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not brought the bill to the floor, and President Trump\u2019s administration has claimed that the bill in its current form \u201cis filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to be blunt: We\u2019ve got to have some more Democrats in the Senate,\u201d Warren said during CNN\u2019s Equality Town Hall on Thursday, responding to a question about how to ensure that the Equality Act passed the Senate. \u201cI\u2019m willing to continue to push Mitch McConnell right now, but my No. 1 goal is to make sure he is not the majority leader come January 2021.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court will make critical decisions for LGBTQ protections\n\nSeparately, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday to determine whether Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits sex discrimination, also protects LGBTQ people from discrimination in the workplace on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nLGBTQ people were more likely than their non-LGBTQ counterparts (51% to 40%) to support \u201ca career politician who knows his or her way around the political process,\u201d the Williams Institute study found. LGBTQ voters and non-LGBTQ voters alike showed greater support for younger candidates, and both groups signaled that the race of a candidate wouldn\u2019t impact how they voted \u2014 though LGBTQ voters were more likely than non-LGBTQ voters to back a candidate because that person was black or Latino.\n\nMajorities of both groups said it wouldn\u2019t matter to their vote if a candidate were gay or lesbian, but far more LGBTQ voters than non-LGBTQ voters said they were \u201cmore likely to support a gay candidate\u201d (41% to 10%) or \u201cmore likely to support a lesbian candidate (34% to 11%). LGBTQ voters also showed greater support for hypothetical candidates who were transgender or gender-nonbinary.\n\n\u201cLGBT voters differ from non-LGBT voters in several ways. For example, they are more likely to be young, male, and live in urban areas,\u201d study author Christy Mallory, the Williams Institute\u2019s state and local policy director, added in a statement. \u201cLGBT voters are also more likely to identify with the Democratic Party. Over four million LGBT Democrats are eligible to vote in the primaries next year.\u201d", "description": "Half of the LGBTQ adults registered to vote next November said they were Democrats and 15% were Republicans.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT166_lgbtq_ZG_20191011124925.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
