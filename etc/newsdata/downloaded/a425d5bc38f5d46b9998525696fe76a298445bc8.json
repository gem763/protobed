The company's success has placed the couple in fourth spot on this year's list with a combined wealth of $799 million.\n\nYet luck has had a role to play. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how it\u2019s gone for other founders,\u201d Ta\u2019eed says. \u201cTheir ideas were as good as ours, they had the drive and for whatever reason, the market just wasn\u2019t with them.\n\n\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been in business, the more I think what an anomaly it is that we have gotten to Envato\u2019s scale with no external investment. We\u2019ve won the lottery of life here, and there\u2019s a responsibility that comes with that.\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201cprofit with purpose\u201d buzzes in business circles. But the talk is walked by Envato\u2019s founding couple, who together own 68 per cent of the business and sit on its board alongside Collis\u2019 older brother Vahid, and father Fuad. (Vahid and another founder, Jun Rung, share the remaining 32 per cent).\n\nWhen they decided to start an Envato profit-share scheme in 2016-17, they didn\u2019t just carve up that year\u2019s black ink. They calculated 5 per cent of each year\u2019s pre-tax profits all the way back to 2006, and from retained earnings they allocated it to every staff member who worked that year, regardless of whether they were still Envato employees.\n\nAbout $13 million went to about 1000 people. \u201cThat was a fun email to send,\u201d Collis Ta\u2019eed told the The Australian Financial Review in April. \u201cI had former colleagues ringing to check it wasn\u2019t a phishing scam.\u201d", "description": "The garage start-up Cyan and Collis Ta'eed founded has grown to be a global powerhouse worth $1.1 billion.
