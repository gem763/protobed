We can hold one hand up to the stars.\"\n\nIn French, the same line translates as: \"On l\u00e8ve une main haute pour demain. On l\u00e8ve une main haute aux \u00e9toiles.\"\n\nBut instead of \"on l\u00e8ve,\" which means \"we raise,\" some say they hear \"enl\u00e8ve,\" which means to remove.\n\nWhile that misunderstanding may boil down to mispronunciation, other parts of the song make little sense in French, critics say.\n\n\"Google Translate does not sing,\" one Twitter user, Lyne Labr\u00e8che, wrote to Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau on Sunday.\n\n\"I repeat, Google Translate does not sing.\"\n\nThe criticism appears to have had an effect. The Liberals said early Monday they are planning to record a new version of the song.\n\nThe song first appeared in English on the Ontario band's Rattlesnake album released earlier this year.\n\nThe French version of the song, posted in a short video clip to social media by the Liberals, has been viewed more than 100,000 times since it was released Sunday morning.\n\nHave you heard our new campaign song yet? Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thestrumbellas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@thestrumbellas</a> for this jam - and for recording it in French especially for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamTrudeau?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TeamTrudeau</a>! <a href=\"https://t.co/A1G7d6nzIR\">https://t.co/A1G7d6nzIR</a> \u2014@liberal_party\n\nThe Liberals say it was translated by the band for the campaign.\n\nMNA Ga\u00e9tan Barrette, a member of the Quebec Liberal Party, slammed the song on Twitter.\n\n\"I listened to it a dozen times and I have not yet understood all the lyrics,\" he wrote, calling it a \"very bad French translation that is very, very, very embarrassing.\"", "description": "Are the Liberals removing one hand for tomorrow?\u00a0That's what the new French-language version of federal party's theme song implies implies.
