Voting percentages low in right-wing strongholds. Disaster!\u201d\n\nWithout their support, \u201cwe will get a left-wing government with Arab parties,\u201d he wrote.\n\nGantz posted a video of himself leaning out a car window in traffic during a random encounter with a supportive commuter. Gantz\u2019s co-leader, Yair Lapid, urged left-leaning constituents to come out and vote and said \u201cBibi is lying,\u201d using Netanyahu nickname.\n\nThe two main parties\u2019 campaigns in Israel\u2019s second parliamentary election in five months pointed to only narrow differences on many important issues: the regional struggle against Iran, the Palestinian conflict, ties with the United States, and the economy.\n\nAn end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to lead to a big change in policy on hotly disputed issues in the peace process with the Palestinians that collapsed five years ago.\n\nNetanyahu has announced his intention to annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinians seek statehood. But Blue and White has also said it would strengthen Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank, with the Jordan Valley as Israel\u2019s \u201ceastern security border\u201d. The Palestinians and many countries consider the settlements to be illegal.\n\nThe election was called after Netanyahu failed to form a coalition following an April election in which Likud and Blue and White were tied, each taking 35 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or parliament. It is the first time Israel has had two general elections in a single year.\n\nNetanyahu, 69, has cast himself as indispensable and blighted by voter complacency over his tenure - the longest of any Israeli prime minister. Prime minister from June 1996 until July 1999, he has held the post since March 2009 and is seeking a record fifth term.\n\nA combination picture shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, Israel September 10, 2019 and Benny Gantz, head of Blue and White party in Tel Aviv, Israel April 10, 2019.

Gantz accuses Netanyahu of trying to deflect attention from his possible indictment on corruption charges that the prime minister has dismissed as baseless.\n\nHagit Cohen, a 43-year-old social worker, said she would back Blue and White rather than her former favourite, the now fringe Labour party: \u201cI don\u2019t want my vote to be wasted. Gantz may not be perfect, but enough is enough with Bibi (Netanyahu).\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a definite sense of fatigue. Many Israelis are fed up with the politicians, or expect more of the same,\u201d said Amotz Asa-El, research fellow at Jerusalem\u2019s Shalom Hartman Institute.\n\nNetanyahu \u201cknows that he needs every extra vote,\u201d he said.\n\nIn April, there was controversy when election monitors from Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party turned up with cameras in Arab areas. Locals accused them of voter intimidation. Likud said they were trying to prevent election fraud.\n\nExcept for a few isolated events where police removed individuals from polling stations, the day progressed without major incident.\n\nRELATIONS WITH WASHINGTON\n\nBefore the last election, Trump gave Netanyahu a boost with U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. This time, the White House seems more preoccupied with Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration plans soon to release an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that may prove a dead letter: The Palestinians have rejected it in advance as biased.\n\nIn Gaza, Palestinians awaited the results of the vote.\n\n\u201cThis election affects many things in our life,\u201d said Mohamad Abdul Hay Hasaneen, a janitor in the city of Khan Younis. \u201cThere might be limited escalations after the election, but I don\u2019t think this would result in a full war.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s open door in Washington and other world capitals, at a combustible time on Israel\u2019s borders with Syria, Gaza, and Lebanon, remains a big draw domestically.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one else running who is worthy of being prime minister,\u201d said Alon Gal, a 53-year-old hi-tech manager. \u201cWith him, at least I know who I am dealing with.\u201d\n\nWeeks of wrangling over who should be tasked with forming the next government could follow the election. Opinion polls indicate Yisrael Beiteinu could hold the key to the next coalition because it is forecast to double its representation in the Knesset, from five seats to 10.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu battled for his political survival in the final hours of a close-run election on Tuesday, urging voters to support him to avert a \"disaster\".", "authors": ["Dan Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430795960&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0PI", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
