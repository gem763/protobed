Ailsa Henderson of the University of Edinburgh, co-director of the study, said: \u201cThese findings demonstrate that Brexit is putting the union under considerable strain regardless of whether we stay or go. Both sides are prepared to fundamentally rewrite the rules of politics as we know it to get what they want. Staying in the EU will likely decrease faith in the union. Brexit could well change its borders.\n\n\u201cIndividuals might profess an attachment to the union, but Brexit has revealed most in Britain to be ambivalent unionists who now see it as expendable to get their own way on Brexit. Because this holds for both Leave and Remain voters, it confirms just how much the Brexit debate has polarised the electorates in Britain. These findings show that polarisation is reshaping how we argue with one another, and what we argue about, but could reshape the union as well.\u201d\n\nHer co-director, Professor Richard Wyn Jones of Cardiff University, added: \u201cIt\u2019s not often that one finds oneself shaken by research findings, but in this case it\u2019s hard to not be genuinely shocked \u2013 not only by the fact that so many think that violence is a likely consequence of Brexit, but that so many on either side of the Brexit divide seem to think that such events might be \u2018worth it\u2019 in order to secure their preferred outcome.\n\n\u201cGiven that we appear to be on the brink of another general election in which further polarisation could be a deliberate campaign strategy for some parties, these findings should give all of us pause for thought and underline the importance of responsible and measured debate.\u201d\n\nYouGov surveyed 1,594 people in England, 1,503 in Wales and 1,006 in Scotland between 27 September and 3 October.", "description": "Voters on both sides of the Brexit\u00a0divide\u00a0believe that violence against MPs\u00a0and members of the public\u00a0is a \u201cprice worth paying\u201d\u00a0to secure their favoured outcome, a new study has found.
