NYT Authors Claim Kavanaugh Told Them To Lie", "language": "en", "text": "If you haven't learned by now, it really seems like authors Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin cannot be trusted in the new book, \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh.\" As Townhall has covered, and at the risk of using some D.C. beltway speak, it sure seems like they have been \"lacking in candor\" or \"telling some mistruths\" about their book and their \"bogus\" bombshell allegation -- aka they sound like liars. But, on Wednesday night, Kelly and Pogrebin claimed that it was actually Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who is a liar. The authors say that Kavanaugh said he would speak to them about his life and various sexual assault allegations against him, but only if they lied in their book and said they never spoke to him. Huh?\n\nNPR's Alison Kodjak tweeted Wednesday night, \"Brett Kavanaugh agreed to talk to @katekelly and @rpogrebin for their book - If they wrote that they didn\u2019t talk with him. The authors \u2014 who told the story tonight @PressClubDC \u2014 refused and walked away from the interview.\"\n\nBrett Kavanaugh agreed to talk to @katekelly and @rpogrebin for their book - If they wrote that they didn\u2019t talk with him. The authors \u2014 who told the story tonight @PressClubDC \u2014 refused and walked away from the interview. \u2014 Alison Kodjak (@alikodjakNPR) September 19, 2019\n\nAs the Daily Caller News Foundation's Amber Athey points out, it sounds like \"he wanted to speak off the record?\"\n\nSo he wanted to speak off the record? very scandalous ?? https://t.co/qCySRrRsx7 \u2014 Amber Athey (@amber_athey) September 19, 2019\n\n\"Anyway, like others have pointed out, it\u2019s highly unlikely Kav told them they had to write he didn\u2019t speak with them. Probably said you can\u2019t say you spoke with me,\" Athey observes.\n\nBut all of this is pretty moot because there is \"[n]o reason to trust the authors who have made it quite clear they\u2019re just trying to justify their original f*ck up,\" she adds.", "description": ".09/19/2019 19:04:45PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/281/5e315f5d-388c-4b66-ad3e-fdf424876556.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
