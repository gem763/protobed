Adam Schiff, D-Calif., talks to the media after Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House Democrats are planning a rapid start to their push for impeachment of President Donald Trump, with hearings and depositions starting next week.\n\nDemocratic leaders have instructed committees to move quickly \u2014 and not to lose momentum \u2014 after revelations that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his potential 2020 Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and his family. The action is beginning even though lawmakers left town Friday for a two-week recess.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Friday that his committee is moving \"expeditiously\" on hearings and subpoenas. And the intelligence panel, the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have scheduled depositions starting next week for State Department officials linked to Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nHere's a look at next steps as Democrats march toward an impeachment vote:\n\nA BUSY RECESS\n\nMembers of the House intelligence panel have been told to be prepared to return to Washington during the break. California Rep. Jackie Speier, on the panel, said she has already canceled some of her previous commitments.\n\n\"We're expected to be here,\" Speier said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has told the Democrats they need to \"strike while the iron is hot\" on impeachment, sending the committees into overdrive. Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat, said a plan is \"being formed very rapidly.\"\n\n\"What I know for sure is that momentum will not slow,\" Himes said.\n\nIllinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat on the intelligence committee, said they will have to \"work harder\" and \"sleep less.\"\n\n___\n\nLONG WITNESS LIST, QUICK TIMELINE\n\nThe intelligence panel has been negotiating to interview the whistleblower who began the firestorm by reporting to the inspector general for the intelligence community that Trump had urged the investigations on a July phone call with Zelenskiy. The whistleblower also said that White House officials then moved to \"lock down\" the details by putting all the records of it on a separate computer system.\n\nThe complaint from the whistleblower, whose identity is not publicly known, was released Thursday after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire withheld it from Congress for weeks.\n\nThe inspector general who handled that complaint, Michael Atkinson, is slated to testify to the intelligence panel behind closed doors on Oct. 4, according to a person familiar with the committee who was spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nLawmakers on the intelligence panel said Friday that they also want to speak to White House aides who were present for the call and to Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, who urged the investigations.\n\nDemocrats say they hope to finish the investigation in a matter of weeks \u2014 perhaps even before Thanksgiving.\n\n___\n\nARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT\n\nOnce the committees have finished their own investigations, the intelligence panel and others will submit their findings to the House Judiciary Committee, which oversees the impeachment process.\n\nWashington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic member of the Judiciary panel, said that the intelligence panel will be the \"star of the show\" as it probes Trump's activities related to Ukraine. Articles of impeachment would be drafted by the Judiciary Committee and, if adopted, sent to the House floor.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has said he wants resolution on impeachment by the end of the year. Jayapal said that deadline \"absolutely\" stands, and that the plan is to be done before January, or \"perhaps sooner.\"\n\n___\n\nREPUBLICAN RESISTANCE\n\nRepublicans have focused their ire about impeachment on the Democrats, criticizing the probes as a rerun of a two-year investigation into Russian election interference in the 2016 election.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the intelligence panel, said Thursday that Democrats \"don't want answers, they want a public spectacle.\"\n\n\"They have been trying to reverse the results of the 2016 election since President Trump took office,\" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\n___\n\nSLOWER SENATE\n\nIf the House votes to approve charges against Trump, the Republican-led Senate would then hold a trial.", "description": "House Democrats are planning a rapid start to their push for impeachment of President Donald Trump, with hearings and depositions starting next week.
