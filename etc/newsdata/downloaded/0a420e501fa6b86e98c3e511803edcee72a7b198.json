Or, perhaps, you might stumble upon a really weird turd.\n\nTwo summers ago, Brandon Barton, a community ecologist at Mississippi State University, and his colleagues were backpacking through the craggy Hells Canyon Wilderness along the Oregon-Idaho border. There, they were studying elk ecology while en route to a scientific conference in Portland, Oregon. But while hiking down a trail, something strange caught Barton\u2019s eye. It was a lump of wolf poop \u2014 and it didn\u2019t look quite right.\n\n\u201cI remember immediately thinking, \u2018Is that a grasshopper?\u2019\u201d recounted Barton.\n\nOnce the researchers picked it up, they could see the scat was absolutely loaded with buggy bits. Legs, heads, wings \u2014 the whole hopper. The path itself was covered with living grasshoppers, with the group having to fend off the bugs as they walked.\n\nFascinated, Barton and his colleagues set up motion-sensor cameras nearby to see if the mystery pooper would return. Barton also bagged up the distinctive dump for further analysis.\n\nBarton checked the cameras the next day, and sure enough, they recorded a wolf slinking through the area in the middle of the night. The team then left the cameras behind and continued to the conference with the poop in tow \u2014 which turned out to be a feat of olfactory endurance.\n\n\u201cWolf faeces smells very, very bad. Like, really bad,\u201d Barton told Gizmodo. \u201cWe put it in a Ziploc bag to contain it and then put it in my backpack, and it was still disgusting. So then we put it in another Ziploc bag, and it was still disgusting.\u201d\n\nEventually, Barton quarantined the miasma in a third bag and stored it in a hotel fridge during the conference. The poop then accompanied the researchers on a flight back to Mississippi, where a colleague painstakingly dissected the stinky treasure.\n\nAll told, the wolf had horked down at least 181 grasshoppers, probably in a single meal. This discovery \u2014 the details of which are published this week in the journal Ecology \u2014 was held up when the team collected the camera footage weeks later and saw that what appeared to be a single wolf coming back, night after night, seemingly feeding on the swarms of grasshoppers that the researchers noticed along the trail.\n\nThe grasshopper-loving wolf, returning to the scene of the crime. (Photo: Brandon Barton)\n\nSince grasshoppers get sluggish in cool, nighttime conditions, Barton thinks the wolf was exploiting a low-effort midnight snack.\n\n\u201cThat wolf just came along like \u2018chomp, chomp, chomp\u2019, because [the grasshoppers] don\u2019t fly away, they don\u2019t hop away,\u201d said Barton.\n\nThe grasshoppers would be a useful food source for a lone wolf, Barton said, since larger animals would be difficult to kill without a pack.\n\n\u201cWhy waste your time running down an elk calf or a cow elk that a lone wolf probably can\u2019t take down anyways, when you can just eat all these grasshoppers?\u201d Barton said.\n\nThe researchers estimate that the wolf\u2019s springy treat could have provided as much as 10 per cent of its caloric needs.\n\n\u201cAt 10 per cent, you\u2019re still hungry,\u201d said Barton. \u201cBut if you can get 10 per cent every day, that\u2019s another day out of every 10 that you get to live.\u201d\n\nWhatever the importance of grasshoppers to the diets of wolves, for Barton, a key lesson from the discovery is that two classic, well-studied food webs \u2014 the \u201caspen tree-elk-wolf\u201d and the \u201cplant-grasshopper-spider\u201d chains \u2014 can actually intertwine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re holding in our hand evidence that those two things are not independent,\u201d said Barton. \u201cWolves are actually feeding on the other food chain.\u201d\n\nA grasshopper, demonstrating the mellowing effects of cold, night air. (Photo: Brandon Barton)\n\nCarolyn Shores, a wildlife biologist at British Columbia\u2019s Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations who was not involved with this study, said the finding is a welcome addition to the growing body of knowledge on wolf diets, but she wonders if the scat is conclusively a wolf\u2019s, since the poop of big coyotes can be mistaken for wolf faeces.\n\n\u201cMy one suggestion to them would be to ID it positively through DNA,\u201d Shores told Gizmodo\n\nTom Gable, a wildlife biologist at the University of Minnesota also not involved with this study, said the finding is interesting, especially because documenting these habits often depends so much on chance observations. But he isn\u2019t as convinced that the wolf-grasshopper relationship has much ecological influence.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really cool natural history observation, but in my opinion it sort of ends there,\u201d Gable told Gizmodo. \u201cIt reaffirms that wolves are adaptable, flexible predators.\u201d\n\nThis gastronomic flexibility is something Gable and his colleagues are increasingly revealing. Wolves have long been typecast as deer and moose enthusiasts, but Gable and his team have recently shown that wolves regularly partake in what sounds like a Northwoods sampler platter.\n\nFish. Swans. Otters. Beavers. Even blueberries.\n\nThe Seven Devils Mountains, near where the wolf scat was found.
