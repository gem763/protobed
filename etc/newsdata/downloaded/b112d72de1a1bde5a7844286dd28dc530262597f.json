Lowey is not seeking reelection. Is that rumor? Are you thinking about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not considering running for Congresswoman Lowey\u2019s seat,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut, Whoopi, I understand why people are asking, and someone has asked me some version of that question for as long as I can remember.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClinton, daughter of former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, said she remembered being \u201c3 or 4 years old\u201d and being asked if she would run for governor of Arkansas one day like her father.\n\n\u201cI share that because I think it\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t just be asked of people whose last name is Clinton or Huntsman,\u201d she said, sitting beside co-host Abby Huntsman, whose father is former Utah governor Jon Huntsman. Also at the table was Meghan McCain, whose father was the late senator John McCain.\n\nClinton said all children and women should be asked if they are interested in running for public office and that if they are, they should be encouraged to do so.\n\nAD\n\nBut Clinton, who is on book tour promoting \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women,\u201d which she co-wrote with her mother, did not rule out one day running.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cbut right now the answer is no.\u201d\n\nClinton, who was a surrogate for her mother during the 2016 presidential campaign, also participated in the table\u2019s conversations about Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate.\n\nShe kept her expression stoic as the co-hosts offered strong opinions about the candidates and their policy differences.\n\n\u201cAt least on the Democratic stage those were issues that were being discussed,\u201d Clinton said, when she weighed in. \u201cAt least gun violence was discussed, at least opioids were discussed, at least universal health care was discussed \u2026 so, just the contrast with Republicans \u2014 with all due respect, Meghan \u2014 could not have been more clear because of what we were talking about. I liked that we had this strong, dynamic conversation.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "While a guest host on \u201cThe View,\u201d the former first daughter said she won\u2019t seek the open seat in the New York district where she lives.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w589EtVohEtKq7kE8TJq2NMdSiU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7IPCCAHQIQI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
