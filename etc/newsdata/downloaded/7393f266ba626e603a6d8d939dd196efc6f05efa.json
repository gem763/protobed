ACES, which provides broad-based to multiple clean energy themes, including scorching hot solar. The fund is up nearly 37% year to date.\n\nACES, which debuted in June 2018, provides exposure to seven alternative energy themes: wind, smart grid, solar, geothermal, biomass, electric vehicles and fuel cells.\n\nWhy It's Important\n\nIncreased adoption of alternative energy sources by large corporations, such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), is seen as a primary driver of future returns for some ACES components.\n\n\u201cUS corporate renewable procurement is surging, with more than 6 GW of direct, indirect, and financial power purchase agreements announced in 2018, more than double that of the prior year,\u201d said IHS Markit in a recent note. \u201cThis surge is being fueled by shareholder and consumer pressure, the opportunity to hedge power costs, and corporate renewable targets, and is leading IHS Markit to increase its outlook for wind and solar deployment in the coming decade.\u201d\n\nAt the corporate level, companies typically deploy solar and efficiency/LED projects for their power needs. Those sub-industries combine for almost 43% of ACES' weight. While technology companies are leading the way in terms of green energy adoption, other sectors are joining the party.\n\n\u201cAn increasingly diverse pool of companies are purchasing renewables. Oil and gas companies have recently jumped into the market for project-specific renewable contracting, with ExxonMobil and Shell inking three deals at the end of 2018 for a cumulative 600 MW of wind and solar,\u201d according to IHS Markit.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nCorporate procurement of renewables is expected to continue and grow at a rapid, potentially cementing ACES' status as strong long-term idea.\n\n\u201cIHS Markit expects large corporations' renewable targets to drive about 60 GW of new capacity additions, through project-specific contracting, from 2019 to 2040,\u201d said the research firm. \u201cIHS Markit expects further growth of renewable capacity driven by large corporate procurements, with shifting trends between wind and solar and expansion of activity in to other markets in the future.\u201d\n\nWind stocks account for more than 29% of ACES' weight.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nAn Interesting Israel ETF\n\nHeaded For Heartache With Healthcare ETFs\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
