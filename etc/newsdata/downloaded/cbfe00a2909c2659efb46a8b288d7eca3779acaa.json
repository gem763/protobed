Too bad, because now you need to head to Detroit, where he\u2019s throwing \u201cJesus Is King: A Kanye West Experience\u201d at the Fox Theatre ahead of the album\u2019s (presumed) release. After holding a Friday Sunday Service at the Aretha Franklin Amphitheater in Detroit this afternoon, the Fox Theatre announced the Experience will take place there tonight at 8 p.m. ET. Tickets are free and can be reserved through Ticketmaster. A representative for the venue told Rolling Stone that whatever Kanye is planning tonight seems to be a \u201cmovie thing\u201d but they don\u2019t have all the details yet. \u201cWe just found out about it, actually,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe usually don\u2019t [book any events day-of], but it\u2019s Kanye West, he can get away with anything.\u201d\n\nAin\u2019t that the truth? Just days ago, reports that Jesus Is King is unfinished broke, despite Kim Kardashian-West retweeting a countdown set to expire today. Even if it\u2019s just by a few hours, the Jesus Is King delay is one in a long line of rocky Kanye album drops. Last year, all five of his releases came with their own drama and the mysterious Yandhi still hasn\u2019t seen the light of day. All we can say for sure is something is happening at the Fox Theatre tonight, even if it\u2019s just a bunch of Kanye fans staring at an empty stage.\n\nJUST IN: Kanye West will bring \u201cJesus Is King: A Kanye West Experience\u201d to #TheFox tonight at 8PM. Guests are encouraged to arrive early. Doors open at 6:30PM. Tickets are free, general admission and only available via https://t.co/Sf9zcR6qqf. pic.twitter.com/1VPsHAin4T \u2014 Fox Theatre Detroit (@FoxTheatreDet) September 27, 2019\n\nUpdate: At just past 7pm on Friday, Kim Kardashian-West tweeted an updated setlist on Marriott stationary, suggesting we are down to the wire.
