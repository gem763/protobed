(Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt started as a pitchers\u2019 duel, but it didn\u2019t end that way. The Houston Astros have taken a 1-0 lead in the American League Division Series, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 6-2. Justin Verlander, every bit an ace at 36, took a no-hitter into the 5th inning and allowed just one hit and 3 walks over 7 innings. He became just the fifth pitcher to throw 7-plus innings with zero runs and one hit or fewer while striking out 8 in a playoff start. (This exclusive club also includes Roy Halladay, Roger Clemens, Mike Mussina, and Tom Glavine.)\n\nIt was Verlander\u2019s 14th playoff win, and according to MLB Network\u2019s Jon Morosi, that\u2019s more than any pitcher since his debut in 2005. Verlander has a playoff reputation, and with Friday\u2019s gem it only grew more impressive and fearsome.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Rays tried and failed to break through against Verlander \u2014 they got their second hit of the game in the 8th, only after he\u2019d departed \u2014 but through four innings, starter Tyler Glasnow threw pitches with a closer\u2019s speed and kept the Astros off the board. Then in the 5th, things fell apart. Glasnow walked Josh Reddick to lead off, and then Jose Altuve hammered a two-run home run to break the scoreless tie. That chased Glasnow from the game, but it didn\u2019t get really out of hand until a pop-up caromed off of Brandon Lowe\u2019s glove, leading to two more runs crossing the plate.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking error, and the Rays never fully recovered. They showed some fight in the 8th, scoring two runs after Verlander had left the game, but by then the Astros were fully in the driver\u2019s seat. Roberto Osuna closed out the 9th and the Astros nabbed a 1-0 series lead.\n\nWHO MADE THE DIFFERENCE\n\nStory continues\n\nJustin Verlander: Verlander is an ace, so he did what aces do: he held the Rays to one hit through five innings until the Astros hitters could figure out Glasnow. And when they finally broke through against the Rays, he never let up and pitched two more scoreless innings.\n\nJose Altuve: He broke the scoreless tie in the fifth inning with a two-run home run, after popping out and flying out in his first two at-bats. He reminded everyone that despite a few injuries this year, he\u2019s still a generational hitter \u2014 not that anyone needed to be reminded.\n\nTyler Glasnow: The Rays\u2019 starter came out throwing fire, and despite allowing four hits and three runs in 4.1 innings, not a single run crossed the plate until Altuve\u2019s homer in the fifth. He gave the Rays all the time he could to get to Verlander before the Astros got to him. Glasnow\u2019s first-ever playoff start didn\u2019t go the way he wanted it to, but his raw talent can\u2019t be denied.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nAltuve\u2019s two-run jack in the 5th broke the scoreless tie and ignited the crowd.\n\nWHAT THEY\u2019LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nAfter looking so strong against the Oakland Athletics in the wild-card play-in game on Wednesday, the Rays looked entirely overmatched against the Astros. They flailed at the plate, not getting any meaningful offense until they were down by six runs in the 8th, and played some shaky defense. The Astros, on the other hand, looked unstoppable \u2014 even when they were struggling to score against Glasnow. It\u2019s just one game of a five-game series, but do the Rays have a chance? Can they, or any team, stop the Astros?\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nGame 2 is Saturday night at 9:07 ET, and it\u2019s poised to be another pitchers\u2019 duel. The Astros\u2019 Gerrit Cole, who\u2019s about to be the most coveted free agent pitcher this winter, is facing off against the Rays\u2019 Blake Snell, who won the 2018 AL Cy Young award. The Rays will need a win to keep things even \u2014 and they\u2019ll need more offense to even compete.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Justin Verlander pitched his heart out and led the Astros to a Game 1 win.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dH9vlJLMU2DVyQAXFahdWQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hK.zJ0AHbnVUrlWadK8iUw--~B/aD0zMDc5O3c9NDYxOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6f3ec3a0-e6ee-11e9-9ff7-2c4722dc6ccc", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
