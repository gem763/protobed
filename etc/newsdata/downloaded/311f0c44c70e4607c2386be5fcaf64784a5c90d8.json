In September, many of those student workers returned to school, which led to a decrease in the number of temporary workers, but it was still greater than what Chinese law stipulates, the advocacy group said.\n\n\"We looked into the claims by China Labor Watch and most of the allegations are false,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We have confirmed all workers are being compensated appropriately, including any overtime wages and bonuses, all overtime work was voluntary and there was no evidence of forced labor.\"\n\nApple did not disclose which of the allegations are true.\n\nFoxconn did not immediately respond to CNBC's emailed request for comment.\n\nWorkers earn a base wage of 2,100 yuan ($295), which is \"insufficient to sustain the livelihood for a family living in Zhengzhou city,\" according to the CLW report.\n\nThe report also claims other rights violations at the factory including:\n\nWorkers at the factory put in \"at least 100 overtime hours a month\" during peak production seasons, even though Chinese labor law states they must not work more than 36 overtime hours a month. Resignations are not approved for regular workers during peak season.\n\nSome dispatch workers failed to receive bonuses promised to them from the dispatch company.\n\nStudent employees also work overtime during peak production season even though internship laws prohibit that.\n\nThe factory does not provide workers with adequate personal protective equipment and workers do not receive any occupational health and safety training.\n\nThe factory does not report work injuries.\n\nApple said it found during its investigation that the percentage of temporary workers exceeded its standards. \"We are working closely with Foxconn to resolve this,\" the company said.\n\nApple's supply chain has faced numerous criticisms over the years due to poor working conditions. For its part, the iPhone maker has pushed suppliers to improve labor practices if they want to continue working with the tech giant.", "description": "Apple said: \"We did find during our investigation that the percentage of dispatch workers exceeded our standards and we are working closely with Foxconn to resolve this issue.\"", "authors": ["Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106048612-1564501774777apple.jpg?v=1567999573", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
