Already popular among fans, Girardi said all the right things Monday.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to me that the fans are behind me,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of the passion for the great game of baseball here. I\u2019ve lived it as a player and as a manager. I know the importance of winning here. I had a chance to compete against a great team with Charlie Manuel here in 2009, and it was a great place to come watch a game. The passionate fans of the Phillies were great \u2014 they were not easy to play against \u2014 and I want it to be that way for many years to come.\u201d\n\nGirardi brings an impressive resume to Philadelphia. He managed the New York Yankees for 10 years, succeeding Joe Torre after the 2007 season. He led New York to its 27th World Series title, beating the Phillies in six games in 2009.\n\nHe also managed the Marlins for one season and was NL Manager of the Year after going 78-84 in 2006, the only manager to win the award with a losing record.\n\nGirardi\u2019s record with the Yankees was 910-710, the sixth-most wins in team history. Girardi won at least 84 games each season in New York and had four years with 95 or more, including 103 in 2009. He led the Yankees to three AL East titles and six postseason appearances.\n\n\u201cHaving had 10 years in a big market in New York like Joe did with a World Series and six playoff appearances, his resume really speaks for itself,\u201d general manager Matt Klentak said. \u201cBut beyond that I can tell you that when we talk to people about Joe, people that he\u2019s known in his career, people that he\u2019s worked with, the players that have played for him, to a man or a person, every one of them would begin that conversation talking about what a good person Joe is and then at the end of that conversation they would conclude with: \u2018Don\u2019t forget that he\u2019s an incredible person.\u2019 I think when you\u2019re making a hire like this it\u2019s a pretty good move to bet on a quality individual and I really think we\u2019re getting one of the best.\u201d\n\nGirardi\u2019s wife, son and two daughters joined him at the news conference. He name-dropped several former Phillies and told a few stories, including asking former Phillies slugger Ryan Howard for an autograph for his son when he was manager of the Marlins. Girardi made his major league debut as a player for the Cubs against the Phillies in 1989 and played his first road game in Philadelphia at old Veterans Stadium.\n\nThe 55-year-old Girardi had a .267 batting average and 1,100 hits with a .991 career fielding percentage as a catcher in 15 seasons. He won three World Series titles playing with the Yankees and was an All-Star with the Cubs in 2000.\n\n\u201cOne way to establish respect, obviously, is your credibility, your track record,\u201d Phillies first baseman Rhys Hoskins said. \u201cHe has one of the best out there, and we\u2019re excited to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nThe Phillies haven\u2019t had a winning season since 2011 when they finished a run of five straight NL East titles, two pennants and one World Series championship under Manuel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m selfish. I want to win,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cWe need to do whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\nGirardi was nicknamed \u201cBinder Joe\u201d in New York for his use of analytics. Former Phillies manager Gabe Kapler was unfairly criticized for relying on analytics too much.\n\n\u201cNumbers tell a story over time,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cI am an analytical guy who has an engineering degree. I love math and they can never give me too much information. It\u2019s a tool we can use to evaluate players in so many different ways. In reality, our job is to bring the best out in players, and whatever tool we have to help us I want it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Joe Girardi hit a grand slam after putting on the red pinstripes for the first time.
