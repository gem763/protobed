Ilhan Omar\u2019s explanation for voting \u2018present\u2019 on resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide is unacceptable", "language": "en", "text": "The House held a vote today on a resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide.\n\nHouse passes resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide with a vote of 405-11 \u2014 Haley Byrd (@byrdinator) October 29, 2019\n\nBelieve it or not, some members actually voted no, which is quite gross:\n\nNOs:\n\nJim Baird\n\nMike Rogers\n\nMac Thornberry\n\nSusan Brooks\n\nGreg Pence\n\nKevin Brady\n\nTom Cole\n\nAndy Harris\n\nMark Meadows\n\nVirginia Foxx\n\nLarry Bucshon \u2014 Haley Byrd (@byrdinator) October 29, 2019\n\nBut not stunning and brave human rights defender Ilhan Omar. Nope, she stunningly and bravely voted \u201cpresent\u201d:\n\nThree members voted present:\n\nPaul Gosar\n\nEddie Bernice Johnson\n\nIlhan Omar \u2014 Haley Byrd (@byrdinator) October 29, 2019\n\nOh well. At least she had a good reason.\n\nJ/K. No she didn\u2019t:\n\nOmar's office has sent this statement to CNN explaining her present vote: pic.twitter.com/Gpj198jx0p \u2014 Haley Byrd (@byrdinator) October 29, 2019\n\nDid we mention she\u2019s a human rights crusader?\n\nNot a fan of this explanation. \u2014 Laura Boyle (@Laura_Boyle_) October 29, 2019\n\nThe defense Rep. Omar and her supporters have against her critics is that she's been unsparing in taking on various foreign policy shibboleths and speaking truth to power about human rights infractions of various US allies, infractions often swept under the rug for real politique \u2014 Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) October 29, 2019\n\nHer \"present\" vote on the Armenian genocide resolution is a bit tough to square with that. Not to say there aren't real politique reasons to avoid enraging Turkey, there are, and it's why the resolution has died a thousand deaths. But that's not usually Omar's thing. \u2014 Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) October 29, 2019\n\nActually, Chris, it\u2019s pretty easy to square this \u201cpresent\u201d vote with who Ilhan Omar is as a person.\n\nIlhan Omar is whatabouting the Armenian Genocide pic.twitter.com/06BbImDWcG \u2014 Ben Laden McDonald (@Bmac0507) October 29, 2019\n\nThat is pathetic \u2014 Brooklyn Mind (@brklynmind) October 29, 2019\n\nThis was not a vote on \"historical crimes against humanity.\" This was a vote on a specific crime against a specific group by a specific perpetrator, and @IlhanMN was the one trying to use it as a lever for political reasons. I am deeply disappointed in her. \u2014 Ashley McConnell (@seesthepoint) October 29, 2019\n\nI've been a vocal supporter of @IlhanMN but no more. There was absolutely no reason for her to not vote on something that is solid historical fact and use the typical world salad of denialists. I once saw her as a human rights defender. \u2014 Hrag (@hragv) October 29, 2019\n\nMy God, what a disgrace. Ilhan Omar refuses to vote in favor of recognizing the Armenian Genocide https://t.co/mB7nybu8O2 \u2014 Harry Khachatrian (@Harry1T6) October 29, 2019\n\nIn other words, Rep. Omar will only condemn a genocide if the resolution also condemns every mass killing over the course of human history. Makes sense. https://t.co/pW64m0R5Hw \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 29, 2019\n\nWait, so we can't condemn *any* genocide if we don't condemn *all* genocides at the same time? Woke logic at its worst extreme \u2026 \u2014 DadRock2020 (@DadRock2020) October 29, 2019\n\nThis was AOC's excuse earlier this year for not condemning anti-semitism \u2014 that you shouldn't single out A for criticism unless you also criticize B, C, and D. Needless to say, Omar and AOC are constantly singling out people and things for condemnation. https://t.co/Fmm12xYh4r \u2014 Noah Pollak (@NoahPollak) October 29, 2019\n\nYeah. This is despicable. \u2014 Jonathan August (@jgaugust) October 29, 2019\n\nIncredibly offensive @IlhanMN. For shame. \u2014 Dove Pedlosky (@DovePedlosky) October 29, 2019\n\nHer predictability is laughable. https://t.co/uxXDVQVp9c \u2014 Ellen Carmichael (@ellencarmichael) October 29, 2019\n\nIlhan Omar is an Armenian genocide denier. Can someone guess why? https://t.co/511rRDqlGA \u2014 Ashley Rae Ghouldenberg \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udd2e (@Communism_Kills) October 29, 2019\n\nIlhan Omar's decision to vote present on the Armenian Genocide resolution is shameful. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. It's not acceptable. There should be no distinction between her voting present and those who voted no. \u2014 \ud83d\udc7b Boo (Drew) Savicki \ud83d\udc7b (@SenhorRaposa) October 29, 2019\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated with additional text and tweets.\n\n***\n\nUpdate:\n\nOn a related note:\n\nOmar also voted no on sanctioning Turkey for its incursion against the Kurds \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 29, 2019\n\nYep:\n\nU.S. House voted 403-16 to sanction Turkey for military incursion into northern Syria. pic.twitter.com/BpGK3WptfP \u2014 Greg Giroux (@greggiroux) October 29, 2019\n\nOmar is the lone Dem against sanctions. Shocker. https://t.co/hmPQW6ltcq \u2014 Sean Agnew (@seanagnew) October 29, 2019\n\nWell, Omar never met a human rights abuser she didn\u2019t like.\n\nNow, if you want to pass a resolution sanctioning Israel, then Ilhan will be there with bells on.\n\n***\n\nRelated:\n\nRep. Ihan Omar, who favors sanctioning Israel, says \u2018we shouldn\u2019t rush into sanctioning countries\u2019 like Iran", "description": "ilhan omar", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Pm On October", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/omar-82ec5ce9-1c71-4318-a18f-d112e6cafbd2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
