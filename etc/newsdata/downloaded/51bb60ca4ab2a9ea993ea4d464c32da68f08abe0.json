Law enforcement and university officials took no disciplinary action.\n\nThe latest version of the 500-pound steel sign marking Graball Landing has been covered with bulletproof glass to deter future vandals.\n\n\"For 50 years nobody talked about Emmett Till,\" Patrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, said, adding: \"I think we just have to be resilient and know there are folks out there that don't want to know this history or who want to erase the history.\n\n\u201cWe are just going to be resilient in continuing to put them back up and be truthful in making make sure that Emmett didn't die in vain.\"\n\nShortly after Till\u2019s death an all-white jury acquitted the two men charged with his murder.\n\nIn subsequent years the pair, who were protected from being tried again, admitted that they had killed him \u2013 while the women who had accused him said she had fabricated evidence against the teenager.\n\nThe brutality of his death became an emblem for the injustice faced by black Americans in the Jim Crow era south, prompting protests and rallies across the country at which his mother, Mamie Till, would speak to crowds as large as 20,000 people.\n\nShortly after the killing, Rosa Parks attended one such rally hosted by a then-largely unknown Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWhen Ms Parks was later asked why she had not moved to the back of the bus during her famous protest against segregation, Ms Parks said: \u201c\"I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nMartin Luther King's daughter says disinformation helped kill father", "description": "A new memorial to Emmett Till, the murdered Chicago teenager credited with sparking the US civil rights movement, has been made bulletproof after previous markers were shot and thrown in the river where his body was found.Till was 14 years old when he was kidnapped, beaten and lynched in August 1955", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TOjQUQMmwIwEc51VTXfQSQ--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/164b26a5ce6acbe954857dd210e4ddbe", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
