Partially reversing a 2.44% rally from Sunday, Ethereum ended the day at $182.02.\n\nA relatively choppy morning saw Ethereum rise to an early morning intraday high $190 before hitting reverse.\n\nComing up against the first major resistance level at $190.11, Ethereum fell back to a late morning low $181.15.\n\nHolding well above the first major support level at $177.77, Ethereum recovered to $185 levels before sliding back to a late afternoon intraday low $181.0.\n\nContinuing to steer clear of the major support levels, Ethereum moved back through to $185 levels before a final hour sell-off that left Ethereum in the red on the day.\n\nThe extended bearish trend, formed at late April 2018\u2019s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact. A reversal from June\u2019s current year high $364.49 back through the 23.6% FIB of $257 reaffirmed the extended bearish trend.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 1.04% to $183.91. A bullish start to the day saw Ethereum rise from an early morning low $181.72 to a high $185.68 before easing back.\n\nEthereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.\n\n[fx-image src=https://www.tradingview.com/x/1biWxpcM/ originalWidth=761 ratio=1.23 data-zoom-target=https://www.tradingview.com/x/1biWxpcM/]\n\nFor the day ahead\n\nEthereum would need to move back through to $184.4 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $187.68.\n\nSupport from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from $185 levels.\n\nBarring an extended rally through the day, Ethereum would likely come up short of Monday\u2019s high $190.\n\nFailure to move through to $184.4 levels could see Ethereum spend another day in the red.\n\nA fall back through the morning low $181.72 would bring the first major support level at $178.68 into play.\n\nBarring a crypto meltdown, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$178 support levels on the day.\n\nLooking at the Technical Indicators\n\nMajor Support Level: $178.68\n\nMajor Resistance Level: $187.68\n\n23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $257\n\n38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $367\n\n62% FIB Retracement Level: $543\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumen\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumen fell by 1.16% on Monday. Partially reversing a 3.18% rally from Sunday, Stellar\u2019s Lumen ended the day at $0.06457.\n\nA particularly bullish start to the day saw Stellar\u2019s Lumen strike an early morning intraday high $0.06898.\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumen broke through the first major resistance level at $0.0666 and the second major resistance level at $0.681.\n\nA pullback through the morning saw Stellar\u2019s Lumen slide back to $0.065 levels before finding support.\n\nSteering well clear of the major support levels, Stellar\u2019s Lumen bounced back to $0.067 levels. Stellar\u2019s Lumen broke through the first major resistance level at $0.0666 for a second time.\n\nA second sell-off, however, saw Stellar\u2019s Lumen slide to a mid-day intraday low $0.06386.\n\nIn spite of the pullback, Stellar\u2019s Lumen left the first major support level untested on the day.\n\nFinding support through the latter part of the day, Stellar\u2019s Lumen moved back through to $0.065 levels before the final hour sell-off.\n\nThe sell-off saw Stellar\u2019s Lumen slide back to sub-$0.065 levels to close out the day in the red.\n\nThe extended bearish trend remained firmly intact, reaffirmed by 24th September\u2019s new swing lo $0.051614. Stellar\u2019s Lumen continued to fall short of the 23.6% FIB of $0.1310 following a pullback from $0.13 levels in late June.\n\nAt the time of writing, Stellar\u2019s Lumen was up by 1.77% to $0.065714. A mixed start to the day saw Stellar\u2019s Lumen fall to an early morning low $0.065049 before striking a high $0.065714.\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumen left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.\n\n[fx-image src=https://www.tradingview.com/x/AbceQWMM/ originalWidth=761 ratio=1.23 data-zoom-target=https://www.tradingview.com/x/AbceQWMM/]\n\nFor the day ahead\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumen would need to move through to $0.0658 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $0.0677.\n\nSupport from the broader market would be needed, however, for Stellar\u2019s Lumen to break out from $0.066 levels.\n\nBarring an extended rally throughout the day, we would expect Stellar\u2019s Lumen to come up well short of Monday\u2019s high $0.06898.\n\nFailure to move through to $0.0658 levels could see Stellar\u2019s Lumen hit reverse. A fall back through the morning low $0.065049 would bring $0.0630 levels into play before any recovery.\n\nBarring a broad-based crypto sell-off, however, Stellar\u2019s Lumen should steer clear of the first major support level at $0.0626.\n\nLooking at the Technical Indicators\n\nMajor Support Level: $0.06260\n\nMajor Resistance Level: $0.06770\n\n23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $0.1114\n\n38% FIB Retracement Level: $0.1484\n\n62% FIB Retracement Level: $0.2082\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below.\n\nThanks, Bob\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "It\u2019s back into the green for the pair.
