After another few hours on endlessly curving roads, the asphalt disappears and our bones jar on endless, bumpy macadam.\n\nThe bus stops in the middle of nowhere. The driver points to a distant red light, saying we need to reach our final destination on foot as the road is blocked. Once there I shiver under a blanket in a hotel room with an open-air toilet and no heating under a red, flickering light. The temperature outside drops to minus 10 degrees Celsius.", "description": "The view from above the Larung Wuming monastery is breathtaking. Colourful Tibetan prayer flags flutter, clouds scud across dark blues sky; in the valley, miniature people go about their business.", "authors": ["Damir Sagolj"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ1DhCtKZQtxpzMAMrwq5KC12W6OsY-fs5cp_2W-l-rCKLFNfOfj74jpNTiXV6P3yXbpslPvzihHX6jOELz5Kq3HIpmXIkqz2XeCtCO_kyQCg"}
