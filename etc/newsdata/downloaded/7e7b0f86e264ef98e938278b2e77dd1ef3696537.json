Earlier this morning, the government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria and making the cease-fire permanent. ... I have, therefore, instructed the secretary of the treasury to lift all sanctions imposed on Oct. 14. ... This was an outcome created by us, the United States, and no other nation.\"\n\nThe big picture: Trump's decision led directly to a Turkish offensive against America's Kurdish allies and the escape of ISIS detainees. And while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was condemned internationally for the invasion, the outcome Trump described rewards him handsomely \u2014 with a long-sought \"safe zone\" negotiated with Russia on the Syrian border and the removal of all U.S. sanctions imposed by Trump, who was effusive in thanking Erdogan today for stopping the offensive.\n\nTrump said a small number of U.S. troops are \"protecting the oil\" in Syria and will continue to do so, a move that is complicated logistically, legally, and in terms of the message it sends about America's presence in the Middle East. He said of the oil, \"We\u2019ll be deciding what we\u2019re going to be doing with it in the future.\"\n\nFacing claims he betrayed the Kurds by clearing a path for Erdogan to attack them, Trump declared that he'd \"saved the lives of many, many Kurds\" by helping end the offensive.\n\nHe continued to portray Syria and the wider Middle East as a hopelessly violent place, saying the U.S. can't hope to solve \"ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts\" before adding: \u201cLet someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand.\"\n\nGo deeper: Russia and Turkey capitalize on Trump's Syria exit", "description": "\"Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/lBNMMeXgivCYRvpV8vXrUwk3bNo=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/23/1571846762740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
