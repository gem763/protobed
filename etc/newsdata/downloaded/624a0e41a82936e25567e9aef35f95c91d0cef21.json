Mini Blades gold!\n\n\"It's great for kids to try something new and experience the joy of skating,\" says Sandra Bezic, Executive Producer and Co-Creator of Battle of the Blades. As a former national pairs champion and Olympian, Bezic is a huge proponent of the playfulness found in the Mini Blades challenges. \"Kids are meant to play and have fun!\"\n\nCombined, the two clubs boast children ages four and up, from over 1,800 area families engaged in competitive and organized sports. Not surprisingly there were a number of teams who paired up and wanted to join the Mini Blades fun.\n\nStreetsville Meadowvale Figure Skating Club Arena\n\nIt's hard to imagine that in-between everything these active and accomplished teenagers \u2014 all between 14 and 16 years old \u2014 have going on that they would have enough left over for Mini Blades.\n\nRiley Broun, Carter Willan, Zoe Botelho at the Streetsville Meadowvale Skating Club.\n\nOwen Rajala / Lindsay LeClair \u2013 Owen volunteers his time at the local food bank and teaching six \u2013 10 year-olds how to bike. Lindsay's skating accomplishments include being a provincial silver medallist as part of an ice dance team.\n\nCarter Willan / Zoe Botelho \u2013 Carter's nickname is \"Drex\" and he spends time with younger hockey players encouraging the love of the game. Away from the rink, Zoe loves spending time with her West Highland Terrier \"Winston.\"\n\nStefano Piscione / Ava Ciarallo \u2013 Stefano loves playing the guitar and Ava has already achieved double Gold medallist status in the figure skating test system.\n\nRiley Broun / Tiffany Plourde \u2013 Riley is a big fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs while Tiffany has spent lots of time earning her Diamond dance tests and becoming a quadruple Gold medallist in the figure skating test system.\n\n\"Organizing practices between the figure skaters' sessions and their volunteering with our Canskate Program, as well as the hockey players practices and games around the city was challenging with volunteer coordinators constantly being in contact with each other and their club,\" said Streetsville Meadowvale board member Kelly Young.\n\nWas it worth the effort according to Young? \"This opportunity has been fun and created long term friendships. Goals have been achieved as a team and as independent skaters. This has really been a great experience for everyone and both clubs hope to return next year.\"", "description": "Sandra Bezic, Executive Producer and Co-Creator of Battle of the Blades says \u201cIt\u2019s great for kids to try something new and experience the joy of skating.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311672.1570460103!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/streetsville-meadowvale-figure-skating-club.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
