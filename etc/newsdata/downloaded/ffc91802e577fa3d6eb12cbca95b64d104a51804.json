Karl Lagerfeld's most iconic designs 1/13 70s chic at Chlo\u00e9 Before he worked at Chanel, Lagerfeld designed for bohemian-inspired label Chlo\u00e9. Here, he's pictured alongside a model ahead of showcasing his spring ready-to-wear collection in 1974 for the French fashion house. While there, Lagerfeld became renowned for cementing the label's romantic roots via bold prints and flowing dresses. Rex Features 2/13 His first collection for Chanel Lagerfeld presented his first collection for Chanel in January 1983, which was widely praised by the press at the time for reinvigorating the brand by bringing hemlines up and adding some pizzazz to the label's accessory line. AFP/Getty Images 3/13 The power suit Thanks to Chanel, the suit has become one of the most adored silhouettes during the 21st Century, with a focus on bolero jackets, tweeds, and chiffons. Following years experimenting with denim, faux rips, hot pants, and concrete beads on the suits, for his spring/summer 2016 haute couture collection the designer hinted at the brand\u2019s focus on sustainability, adorning one suit from the collect with finely cut pieces of wood. AFP/Getty Images 4/13 The interlocking logo It's one of the most recognisable logos in the world, but the famous interlocking \"C\" logo might not be on Chanel's products today had it not been for Lagerfeld. The designer modernised the label when he took over as artistic director in 1983, proceeding to put the now-iconic logo on a whole host of Chanel garments and accessories. Some believe the double \"c\" stands for Coco Chanel, in reference to the brand's founder. But others claim it was inspired by a visit by Chanel herself to Ch\u00e2teau de Cr\u00e9mat in Nice, where she's believed to have attended several parties hosted by her friend, socialite Irene Brez. Here, the logo is seen on one of Chanel's most sought-after products: the chain-strap handbag. 5/13 The pink ruffle gown It was the gown that sparked a thousand \"oohs\" and \"aahs\". Lagerfeld ended his spring/summer 2017 show with a thrilling ruffled pink gown as modeled by Lily Rose Depp, whose casting in the show was made all the more significant given that her mother, Vanessa Paradis, was also a model for the brand. Getty Images 6/13 The Fendi 'baguette' It is probably Fendi's most famous item. The slim, baguette bag was designed by Silvia Venturini Fendi, who is the only family member still working at the Italian label. But under Lagerfeld's reign, it has become a cult fashion item, having been reworked season to season with new designs continuously emerging.

AFP/Getty Images 8/13 The Dying Swan dress Lagerfeld might be better-known for his fashion designs, but he also dabbled in costume and produced this tutu for the English National Ballet in 2009 as part of a special production by the dance company Ballets Russes, for whom Coco Chanel was a benefactor. Getty Images 9/13 The 'lampshade' dress Keira Knightley struck a distinctive silhouette in this Chanel dress, which she wore to Paris Fashion Week in 2014 to attend the brand's autumn/winter show. The corseted layer dress was from the brand's couture spring 2014 collection. AFP/Getty Images 10/13 The multi-layered pearl necklace One of Lagerfeld's most contemporary contributions to Chanel was accessories. The multi-layered pearl necklace continues to be a prominent feature of his collections, and have been firm favourites among celebrities, too. In 2006, it even made an appearance in the cult fashion film \"The Devil Wears Prada\", in which it was worn by lead actor Anne Hathaway to illustrate her character's newfound fashionable taste. Getty Images 11/13 The Karl Lagerfeld x H&M collaboration In 2004, Lagerfeld was the first designer to collaborate with the Swedish retailer, who has been partnering with major fashion brands ever since. The collection prompted huge excitement among Lagerfeld's fans as they reveled in the fact that they could now purchase his designs as a lower price point.

The model was dressed in a cr\u00eape de Chine dress with a gold, brocade cape and a line of buttons along the bodice. The model\u2019s hair was teased into a quiff. AFP/Getty Images 13/13 Cara Delevigne's space-age outfit for the Met Gala The model has been a Chanel muse for several years and chose to support the brand at the 2017 Met Gala by wearing a dramatic sci-fi-inspired suit. The suit featured a plunging neckline and bold shoulders, contrasting with the star's smooth metallic-painted silver bald head. The model-turned-actor accessorised the look with a dusting of silver body glitter and a wide silver belt at the waist. 1/13 70s chic at Chlo\u00e9 Before he worked at Chanel, Lagerfeld designed for bohemian-inspired label Chlo\u00e9.

And you know what it means in French to have a long arm?\n\n\u201cIt means you are influential.\u201d\n\nThe late designer also explained that he preferred fingerless versions because he could still sketch while wearing them.\n\nHowever, Lagerfeld's fascination with gloves may be aligned to his lifelong dislike for his hands from a young age.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 14, I wanted to smoke because I wanted to look grown-up,\u201d he once said.\n\n\u201cBut my mother said: 'You shouldn't smoke. Your hands are not that beautiful and that shows when you smoke\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe German designer also admitted he avoided wearing hats because of something else his mother had said.\n\n\u201cI love hats, in a way, but when I was a child, I'd wear Tyrolean hats, and my mother \u2013 I was something like eight \u2013 said to me, 'You shouldn't wear hats. You look like an old dyke.'\n\n\u201cDo you say such things to children? She was quite funny, no?\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday 19 February, Chanel confirmed that Lagerfeld had passed away at the age of 85 in Paris.\n\nThe company has since announced Virginie Viard \u2013 Lagerfeld\u2019s \u201cright hand woman\u201d \u2013 as his successor.", "description": "To many fashion fans, the immortalised image of the late\u00a0Karl Lagerfeld, will always consist of his white ponytail, high collared shirts and signature black sunglasses.
