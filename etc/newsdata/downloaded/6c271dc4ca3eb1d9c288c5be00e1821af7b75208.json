On Sept. 20, he told reporters he was under no pressure to reach a deal with China before the 2020 election, despite his early insistence that China was eager to return to the negotiation table. Last month, Trump said the U.S. had reached a trade deal with Japan, though terms of the deal were scarce.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s trade deal with Japan hits snag amid auto tariff fears\n\nThe year-long dispute between the United States and China has compelled U.S. businesses to scale back on investing amid the uncertainty wrought by Trump\u2019s at-times contradictory trade policies. He often points to a strong domestic economy as his best argument for reelection, but there have been signs of an economic slowdown. Wall Street is frequently jolted by Trump\u2019s sudden pronouncements. Manufacturing is in a slump, and hiring cooled in August.\n\n\u201cThe darkening outlook for trade is discouraging but not unexpected,\u201d WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said in a statement. \u201cBeyond their direct effects, trade conflicts heighten uncertainty \u2026 Job creation may also be hampered as firms employ fewer workers to produce goods and services for export.\u201d\n\nThe WTO emphasized that the \u201chigh degree of uncertainty\u201d surrounding global trade affects the organization\u2019s projections. Figures could worsen if trade tensions escalate, or the numbers could improve if the sparring abates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe WTO further warned that additional rounds of tariffs \u2014 and retaliation against those levies \u2014 \u201ccould produce a destructive cycle of recrimination.\u201d Constantly shifting monetary and fiscal policy could destabilize volatile financial markets. A sharper slowdown of the global economy could produce an even larger downturn in trade. And complications from Brexit could have ripple effects throughout Europe, the WTO said.\n\nTrump said he\u2019d rebuild manufacturing. Now it\u2019s in decline. What happened?\n\nMajor economies around the world are either already in recession or on the brink. Many of the countries experiencing downturns are also highly dependent on selling goods overseas, which doesn\u2019t bode well during a global trade war.\n\nGermany, for example, is heavily reliant on manufacturing cars and other industrial goods, and the German government has been reluctant to spend money to stimulate growth. Italy, the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, entered a recession last year and has struggled from political crises that have hampered additional economic aid from the government. Mexico has been a target of Trump\u2019s trade and immigration fights, and Brazil, the largest economy in South America, has struggled to sell goods overseas and is seeing slowed demand at home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe United Kingdom has also seen an investment slump, largely due to uncertainty over Brexit. Many worry that if Britain were to leave the European Union without a deal, the nation would enter a recession. Britain\u2019s possible departure from the European Union was thrust into further chaos last month when its highest court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s recent decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful.\n\nAt the heart of the White House\u2019s trade war with China are escalating tariffs placed on Chinese imports. The White House has imposed tariffs on more than $250 billion in Chinese goods, with higher tariffs set to go into effect before the end of the year. Despite the fact that the tariffs are spiking costs on a range of products, Trump claims that they are crucial to disrupting the Chinese supply chain and recalibrate the economic ties between Washington and Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe multilateral trading system remains the most important global forum for settling differences and providing solutions for the challenges of the 21st century global economy,\u201d Azevedo said.\n\nAD", "description": "The international body said world merchandise trade volumes are now only expected to rise by 1.2 percent this year \u2014 markedly slower than the 2.6 percent growth forecast in April.", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/68OXRaEjY7kewvdGOu7oeYLTb0k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4HUHKQG3KQI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
