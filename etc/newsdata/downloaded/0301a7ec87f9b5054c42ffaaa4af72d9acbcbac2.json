Collier, who had worked events at the stadium for one year for a third-party distributor, was allegedly attempting to run a scam and was charged with grand theft in Miami. He was released on $10,000 bail.\n\nThe cost of the two beers should have run less than $20. The scam didn\u2019t exactly require Hercule Poirot to crack.\n\nThe fan who purchased the two beers received an alert from his credit card company about the purchase. Tracking down the vendor was made easier by the fact that Collier\u2019s name showed up on the charge.\n\nCollier was fired from the distribution company that employed him following his arrest.\n\nThe $724 pricetag could have landed the fan five bottles of Dom Perignon 2009. Or for an especially good time, he could have passed 18 bottles of Courvoisier cognac around the section at Hard Rock Stadium to make watching the Dolphins a bit more bearable and still have a few dollars left over.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "A beer vendor was arrested after running a scam that charged a Miami Dolphins fan $724 for two beers.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Nathaniel-Collier-Miami-Dade-County-Jail.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
