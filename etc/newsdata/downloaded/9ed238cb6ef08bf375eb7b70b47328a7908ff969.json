It's also Official Timekeeper at the US Open, and the French Open recently also switched from Longines to Rolex as their sponsor.\n\nMany of tennis' biggest stars, too, are sponsored by luxury watch companies. Roger Federer has been endorsed by Rolex since 2004, Seiko renewed its partnership with Novak Djokovic in 2016, and Tag Heuer counts Petra Kvitova and Kei Nishikori among its ambassadors.\n\nRead more: The incredible life of Roger Federer, the highest-paid tennis player in the world\n\nWhile these players are always seen with one of their sponsor's timepieces on their wrists outside the tournaments, some like to take it a step further and keep their watches on while they play.\n\nSome watches are built to take the strain\n\nBetween them, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, Stan Wawrinka, and Naomi Osaka wore $776,500 worth of watches while they played at the 2019 US Open, according to the experts at luxury watch marketplace Crown & Caliber.\n\nNaomi Osaka wore a $500 Citizen watch at the 2019 US Open. mpi04 / MediaPunch / IPX\n\nThis mind-boggling price tag is largely down to the men's champion, Nadal, wearing his Richard Mille RM 27-03, which was made especially for the Spaniard and retails at an eye-watering $725,000.\n\nWawrinka and Williams, meanwhile, both wore Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshores at $28,000 and $23,000 respectively, while Osaka showcased the affordable option with a $500 Citizen Eco-Drive.\n\nSo why do these tennis stars decide to keep their wristwear on when others abstain? It is, of course, in part, down to personal preference. Tennis involves a lot of wrist action and some players avoid having extra weight on their forearms for obvious reasons.\n\nHowever, it's also down to the choice of watch. Nadal's Richard Mille, for example, is made of carbon fiber, Quartz TPT, and Grade 5 titanium, which makes it not only ultra-light, but also virtually indestructible.\n\nThough it weighs just 20 grams, the RM 27-03 was tested to withstand shocks of up to 10,000 G \u2014 for context, the record for highest G-force on a roller coaster is 6.3. So while the force of Nadal's forehand is infamous, his watch should have no trouble keeping up.\n\n\"The real idea was to create a watch that was strong enough to wear while playing, but so light that I would hardly feel it,\" Nadal \u2014 who first partnered with Richard Mille in 2014 \u2014 said before the French Open.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. wore a $189,500 Richard Mille while playing\n\nRichard Mille recently received another unlikely sporting endorsement from Odell Beckham Jr., who wore an orange RM 11-03 in his first game with the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. plays in his $189,500 Richard Mille watch.

If you have a vintage watch with lots of delicate parts, you risk damaging the watch crystal.\n\n\"Stay away from dress watches,\" Bazemore writes. \"Their movements are more sensitive to impact.\"\n\nShe adds that people should avoid wearing gold watches for sport, since it's a softer metal than stainless steel or titanium and therefore more prone to damage.\n\nFinally, \"leave the leather strap at home,\" since sweat will seep into the leather and become trapped.\n\nInstead, Bazemore recommends a strong dive watch, which are built to withstand intense underwater pressure. Quartz watches, too, she writes \"both durable and lightweight.\"\n\n\"In general, choose a model in stainless steel or titanium with either a bracelet or a rubber strap.\"\n\nBe warned: no matter what model you decide on, there is always some risk involved in wearing your watch for sport.\n\nRead more:\n\n15 celebrity-owned liquor brands, ranked by the price of a bottle\n\nJimmy Fallon had Naomi Osaka, Andy Murray, and other tennis stars slip ridiculous phrases into their interviews at the 2019 US Open\n\n4 pieces of modern technology that Quentin Tarantino refuses to use, from email to Netflix", "description": "The Spaniard's watch was specially designed to weight just 20 grams while also being virtually indestructible.", "authors": ["Tom Murray"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7789b92e22af4770358824-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
