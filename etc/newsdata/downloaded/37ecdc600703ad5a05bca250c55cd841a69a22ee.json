As the story builds up to its tragic climax, it\u2019s worth looking back at how Corrie has dealt with the subject of dying and death with sensitivity, insight and honesty.\n\nKathryn Mannix, palliative care consultant and author of \u2018With the End In Mind: How to Live and Die Well\u2019 says as a society we don\u2019t like to talk about death. We talk of people \u2018passing away\u2019 or just \u2018passing.\u2019 This is supposed to make this most difficult of subjects easier to bear, but in reality it can make it hard to have the important conversations that need to be had when someone is dying. \u2018Confronting the process allows us to plan for and relate to our dearest people over the last part of their lives,\u2019 Mannix says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoronation Street is using this story to confront these taboos. Soon after she finds a lump on her neck on her wedding day, Sinead talks to new husband Daniel (Rob Mallard) about their son Bertie being her legacy. He tells her not to talk like that, but Sinead insists, \u2018You have to let me say things.\u2019\n\nSinead is shown as always being one step ahead of Daniel in accepting what\u2019s going to happen. \u2018It\u2019s bad news,\u2019 she says in the consultant\u2019s office. \u2018Tissues on the table \u2013 it\u2019s a dead giveaway.\u2019 Instantly she starts thinking about little Bertie and the things she\u2019ll miss \u2013 his first Christmas, his first day at school. She\u2019s understandably angry about dying at such a young age. When Daniel tells her he wants to savour every second they have left, Sinead says, \u2018Or resent every second I\u2019m losing.\u2019\n\nHaving the diagnosis allows her to start thinking about Bertie\u2019s future after she\u2019s gone. She wants him to have music lessons and wants Daniel to show Bertie the wedding video, so her little boy knows her voice. It\u2019s almost too painful for her to contemplate, but important that she expresses what she wants. \u2018In the end all I\u2019ll be is a story, like the bear from the Bear Hunt,\u2019 she says, in a raw and emotional scene.\n\nAlthough Daniel says straight away that he wants to care for Sinead at home, reality hits very quickly after her first session of chemo. With Sinead being violently sick and Bertie crying for attention, Daniel doesn\u2019t know which way to turn. \u2018I\u2019m dying, Daniel \u2013 what did you think it was going to be like?\u2019 Sinead asks him. \u2018Did you expect me just to lie here on the couch until I gently faded away? Is all this a bit too real for you?\u2019 Katie McGlynn really conveys Sinead\u2019s anger and grief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe effect of the news on friends and family is also shown, as people don\u2019t know what to say or how to react. Chesney (Sam Aston), who\u2019s been so close to Sinead, is so lost for words she gets angry at him. \u2018Alright, you can stop staring at the freak show now. That\u2019s what I am \u2013 poor Sinead.\u2019 Touchingly he later tells her she\u2019ll always be \u2018just Sinead\u2019 to him.\n\nEvelyn (Maureen Lipman), in her forthright style, manages to strike the right tone. When Sinead forgets her purse when she goes to Dev\u2019s shop Evelyn says, \u2018Don\u2019t be expecting any freebies just because you\u2019re on your last legs.\u2019 Sinead thanks her for treating her like a normal human being, but Evelyn passes a freebie to Daniel anyway, and Dev (Jimmi Harkishin) also lets Daniel have some stuff on the house. The kindness and compassion of other people, doing their best even though their best can never be good enough, has been an important part of the story.\n\nThe relationship between Sinead and Beth (Lisa George) has provided some of the most touching moments, including a scene where Sinead tells her auntie what she wants to wear for her funeral \u2013 a green dress and no shoes. Beth manages to hold herself together until Sinead leaves the room and then sobs like her heart will break.\n\nDespite Daniel\u2019s insistence that he\u2019ll care for his wife at home to the very end, Sinead gets him to visit a hospice with her. Daniel finds it \u2018quite inspiring\u2019 and Sinead is reassured by the warm, supportive environment and the kind and sympathetic staff member they speak to. She\u2019s worried, she tells a nurse later, about Bertie growing up in the house where his mother died. There\u2019s a feeling that she would be happier in the hospice but it\u2019s not a conversation that Daniel is ready to have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSinead faces her fears head on. \u2018It\u2019s not the dying, it\u2019s the leaving,\u2019 she tells Daniel. To the nurse, when she doesn\u2019t have to put a brave face on, she explores her fears: \u2018I just hope it\u2019s not like \u2013 whoosh, one minute I\u2019m here and the next I\u2019m not. It\u2019s the thought of sudden nothingness.\u2019\n\nAs Kathryn Mannix says, \u2018Dying people embrace living not because they are unusual or brave, but because that\u2019s what humans do.\u2019 Coronation Street, Katie McGlynn, Rob Mallard and Lisa George have shown exactly that, and they\u2019ve done it beautifully.\n\nFor practical and emotional support at the end of life and through bereavement visit macmillan.org.uk\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Corrie has hit an effective tone when dealing with the sensitive issue of terminal illness.", "authors": ["Sue Haasler"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_10_coro_daniel_sinead_2nd_ep_02-b911_1570197812.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
