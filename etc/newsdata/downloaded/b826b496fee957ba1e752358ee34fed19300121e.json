Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the world lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily,' he tweeted Tuesday night.\n\nLynching refers to the horrific extrajudicial killings of African Americans in the late 19th and early 20th century carried out by white supremacists in the U.S.\n\nTrump was heavily criticized for using that choice word - which carries a serious weight in U.S. racial politics.\n\nTwitter users were quick to call Biden out for his gaffe, his latest in a string of stumbles in his race for the Democratic nomination\n\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said: 'The President never should have made that comparison.'\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, who is running for president and is the second African American woman ever elected to the Senate, called Trump's statement 'disgraceful'.\n\nNew Jersey Sen.
