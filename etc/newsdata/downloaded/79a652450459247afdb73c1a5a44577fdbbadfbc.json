A referendum was held, which voted in favour of allowing the controversial monarch, dubbed \u201cKing Rat\u201d by the British press, to return to Belgium from exile in Switzerland.\n\nBelgium was bitterly divided between the King\u2019s supporters and critics and the country was paralysed by one of its most violent general strikes on his return. In Liege, the Belgian flag was torn down and replaced with the crowing cock of Wallonia, the French-speaking region\u2019s symbol.\n\nWith Belgium on the point of collapse, and the catholic nobility incensed by his 1941 marriage to Lilian Baels while a prisoner of the Germans, he abdicated in favour of his son Baudouin.\n\nIn 1960, he moved to Argenteuil from the royal residence of Laeken and remained there, out of sight and mind, until his death in 1983. He used the castle as a base to pursue his interest in natural sciences.\n\nThe castle of Argenteuil is an old royal estate located on the territory of Waterloo, Ohain and La Hulpe in the province of the Walloon Brabant (Belgium) Credit: Isopix/Rex/Isopix/Rex More\n\nPrincess Lilian died in 2002 and the castle passed to the Belgian state, despite Baudouin\u2019s desire to convert it into a memorial for his parents.. It was sold for \u00a37 million in 2004 to Walloon businessman Jean-Marie Delwart.\n\nMr Delwart, 80, renovated the castle, which was crumbling into disrepair and has now decided to sell it. Belgian media reported that renovations of up to \u00a3810,000 will still be necessary.\n\nLocal media reported that the castle has its own golf course and its gates are embossed with the intertwined L and L of Leopold and Lillian. The grounds are peppered with deer statues, which were a favourite of Princess Lilian, but the swimming pool is in dire need of repair.", "description": "The castle that served as a golden cage for the hated wartime king of Belgium has been put up for sale for \u00a318 million, making it one of the country\u2019s most expensive properties.\u00a0\u00a0 Over the years, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Former Libyan despot Muammar Gaddafi both made offers for\u00a0 Argenteuil", "authors": ["James Crisp"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pBX_6ZqyAynjB5rj8ZdSkQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/426f52f7a8ac74404e1f49042034d8f1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
