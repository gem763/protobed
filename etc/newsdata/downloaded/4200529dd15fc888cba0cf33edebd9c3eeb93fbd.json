Maybe we can make a post on there together sometime?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Brendan seemed mortified at their response and his words, offering up what seems to be a pretty genuine apology for his behaviour.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what you just said but ok,\u2019 Brendan joked back.\n\nTeen favourites Max and Harvey (Picture: Chelsea Lauren/REX)\n\n\u2018It did sound very bitchy (shame on me) but make no mistake\u2026 you smashed your songs, ours one song was pants and your talent speaks for itself.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m off with my tail between my legs and you are amazing! Soz boys! You are amazing.\u2019\n\nSomeone actually apologising and saying sorry without deflecting? In the age of the internet? We\u2019re astounded.\n\nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk about their experience on the show so far, Jeremy said: \u2018The singing has been challenging but we have been enjoying it. I think people might be pleasantly surprised.\u2019\n\nAnd it seems his duetting buddy is in agreement, as he added: \u2018I can speak for both of us when I say bring it on.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
