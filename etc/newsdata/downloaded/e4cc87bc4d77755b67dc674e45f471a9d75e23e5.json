They actually expelled him from the party conference, after police had to be called to a function room to step into a row he was having with security personnel.\n\nParamedics were called. Around a third of the entire conference area was placed on lockdown.\n\nIt would eventually become known that Mr Clifton-Brown, MP for the Cotswolds, had been trying to blag his wife into the International Lounge without accreditation. And when his plan failed, became very agitated.\n\nWhat Mr Clifton-Brown did next remains shrouded in a certain amount of secrecy.\n\nIt has been speculated that Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown shouted, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\n\nThat may or may not be true, but what certainly is true is that, as Geoffrey Clifton-Brown made his premature way to Manchester Piccadilly station, quite a lot of people can now say they know who Geoffrey Clifton-Brown is than would have been the case 24 hours before.\n\n\u201cWe stand with the brave men and women of our police and security services,\u201d Ms Patel continued. The brave men and women, who go rushing into the face of danger, putting themselves in the harm\u2019s way, right here, in the middle of the Conservative Party conference.\n\nWe stand with the thin blue line of heroes that stand, quite literally, between the party of law and order and a security worker with whom the party of law and order has lost its temper, because the party of law and order\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t have the required accreditation to get into a very poorly appointed indoor marquee space with free filter coffee and not much else.\n\nIf anything, Mr Clifton-Brown, aka The Cotswolds One, was lucky. What happened next could have floored him, quite literally.\n\n\u201cI have created a new fund to give police chiefs the ability to train and equip police officers with Tasers,\u201d said the home secretary. It was an actual policy announcement.\n\n\u201cIt is the job of chief constables to make that operational decision. It is the job of the home secretary to empower them to do so. I am giving them that power.\u201d\n\nA lucky escape then. If she\u2019d given them that power about an hour earlier, the MP for the Cotswolds might well have discovered that merely being an elected representative of the party of law and order, doesn\u2019t mean the party of law and order will think twice before leaving you writhing about on the floor of its International Lounge like a goldfish out of its bowl.\n\nStill, not everyone might find themselves so fortunate. As the home secretary, stood there, taking her party\u2019s rightful place as the party of law and order, it was tricky not to recall that, just last week, the party of law and order was found, in the Supreme Court, to have acted unlawfully when it shut down parliament.\n\nIt\u2019s also tricky not to consider that the prime minister still won\u2019t give an honest answer about what he intends to do, on 19 October, when he is highly likely to be legally compelled to ask the EU for an Article 50 extension, which he has said he will refuse to do.\n\nUntil this afternoon, it had been widely suggested that that course of action will land him back in the Supreme Court before the end of the month.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of hassle involved in that, not to mention significant public expense. Why bother, now that the party of law and order has come up with a far better solution.\n\nThree torturous years later and all political attempts to break the Brexit deadlock have failed. Who knows what 10,000 volts might achieve?", "description": "The lights drop, the pre-roll music plays, the home secretary strides on to the conference stage to the sound of thrilled applause.
