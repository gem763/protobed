No matter, this WNBA championship already looks good on them.\n\nAD\n\nIn a worthy series that went to a decisive fifth and final game, the Mystics defeated the Connecticut Sun, 89-78, to earn the franchise\u2019s first title. Washington\u2019s run, one that truly started a year ago when it was swept in the Finals by the Seattle Storm, continued through a historic regular season, an MVP campaign from Elena Delle Donne and now, finally, the WNBA trophy. The Mystics\u2019 trophy.\n\nAD\n\nEmma Meesseman, the Finals MVP, was asked on the court in the confetti-strewn aftermath of the win what her mind-set was as she began to take over the game. She responded like a freshly crowned champion.\n\n\u201cThat trophy,\u201d she told an ESPN reporter.\n\nThat trophy was applauded by managing partner Sheila Johnson, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and the local NBA team\u2019s two cornerstones, Bradley Beal and John Wall.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the rest of the Washington Wizards players boarded a charter to New York City, Wall and Beal stayed behind to watch the city\u2019s best basketball team reach the summit of excellence. A place the Wizards, as a franchise, haven\u2019t seen since they were called the Bullets more than 40 years ago.\n\nAhead of the series, Beal noted how close the Mystics were to earning yet another championship trophy for Ted Leonsis \u2014 his Washington Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018 \u2014 and internalized the feeling of becoming the ringless stepchild.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWell, I know the Wizards got to get rolling, man,\u201d Beal declared last month. \u201cBecause the Mystics are about to bring in that hardware, and before you know it, that\u2019s two for Ted on his teams, and he\u2019s going to be looking at us with a few frowny faces.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut on Thursday night, there were no passive expressions of sibling jealousy. The pair of Wizards, supportive and dressed in red jerseys like Mystics superfans, expressed pure joy for their sisters of Monumental Basketball. Wall leaped out of his front-row baseline seat, screaming and nearly spilling over the white line when Natasha Cloud raced in for a layup to give Washington the 72-70 advantage with 6:26 remaining. Beal, his mouth agape, stood up and danced after Meesseman pulled yet another trick out of her bag of moves and scored inside to extend the Mystics\u2019 lead to eight.\n\nTogether, Wall and Beal were invited past the yellow ropes because family members were welcomed to take part in the on-court celebration.\n\nAD\n\nThat trophy was presented in a neighborhood the team had supported in the loudest way it knew how \u2014 by shutting up.\n\nAD\n\nWard 8, home for the new Entertainment and Sports Arena, is a commercial district flush with more corner liquor stores than grocery options and a neighborhood where 31 percent of the residents live beneath the poverty line, compared with 13.8 percent overall in the District of Columbia, according to DC Health Matters statistics. In June, Cloud grew disturbed after visiting a local elementary school and discovering that a stray bullet had canceled an event. She responded by staging a media blackout the next game, drawing attention to gun violence in the community.\n\nHer teammates followed the example, and beyond PR lip service, the Mystics spent their inaugural season in Ward 8 as a good neighbor.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSometimes especially minority communities get forgot about,\u201d Cloud said recently. \u201cThat\u2019s my promise to this community in Southeast, that I won\u2019t let them be forgotten.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd that trophy was earned by perhaps the best collection of offensive players in WNBA history and the general manager-coach, Mike Thibault, who brought them here. No coach has won more games in league history, and before Thursday night, Thibault\u2019s supporters tried to tamp down the narrative that he needed a championship on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Some might still say Thibault didn\u2019t need the validation . . .\n\n\u201cBut it sure feels good though,\u201d Thibault said after the win.\n\nDelle Donne signed here to be near family. When injuries \u2014 and there have been plenty \u2014 threatened her prime, she gritted through a deep bruise, mobilized her left knee in a brace or strapped on a plastic face mask and played on. In Game 5, Delle Donne moved chunkily in the paint and did not possess the graceful rhythm of the league\u2019s first 50-40-90 player, but she still scored 21 points on 8-for-16 shooting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKristi Toliver was another free agent who came here with a clear intention. She was an NCAA (2006 with Maryland) and WNBA (2016 with the Los Angeles Sparks) champion looking to build another contender from the ground up. In her, the Mystics found their fiery leader who, much like Delle Donne, played as the walking wounded in this series. Yet she sacrificed her body, particularly her neck, to take an offensive foul during the team\u2019s comeback.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Meesseman, selected in Thibault\u2019s first draft. She juggled her commitment to her Belgium national team and the Mystics and sat out last year but became the missing piece in this title run. The team was down and nearly out before she took over in the third quarter on four consecutive plays that resulted in free throws or buckets. That team-high 22 points gave her a separate trophy she can place on her own mantel.\n\nThe Mystics will share that elusive silver trophy with their famous friends and faithful fans, but this one is all their own.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "From the MVP Elena Delle Donne battling injuries, to the coach-GM seeking a capstone for a decorated career, to a neighborhood in need, the Mystics bring a championship home.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dHLtcKV12SRk4V-7PuTMZyx-SpE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EY4R5EXL24I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
