AMZN 0.81% is introducing a high-resolution version of its music service, making it the first major subscription-streaming player to offer digital sound quality on par with CDs.\n\nThe move into higher-quality audio\u2014at a higher price\u2014is a sign of the music-streaming market\u2019s maturation, say music industry executives, who have called for different forms of subscriptions beyond the standard $9.99-a-month offerings from Spotify Technology SA SPOT 0.71% and Apple Inc. AAPL 0.36%\n\nOther services including Tidal offer high-definition sound, but they tend to market to a niche, audiophile audience. Now Amazon Music, the No. 3 music-streaming service by subscriptions, envisions bringing better sound quality to the masses. At $12.99 a month for Prime members and $14.99 a month for nonmembers, Amazon Music HD is intended to be more affordable than comparable services such as one from Tidal, which costs $19.99 a month.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think higher-quality sound will be an advantage for Amazon Music as it competes with Spotify and Apple Music? Join the conversation below.\n\nMusic streaming has become mainstream\u2014accounting for 80% of revenue from recorded music, according to an industry trade group. But in getting there, audio quality has suffered, says Steve Boom, Amazon\u2019s vice president for music. Enough customers now see audio quality as important enough that they will pay for it, so the move into the market is worth it, he said. \u201cThis is the next wave in music streaming,\u201d Mr. Boom said.\n\nThe new tier, available Tuesday in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan, has more than 50 million audio tracks in CD-quality high definition and what the company describes as millions of tracks in even-higher-quality \u201cUltra-HD.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s Ultra-HD is comparable to Tidal\u2019s \u201cMasters,\u201d which both promise better sound quality than CD. Tidal offers about 60 audio million tracks, including more than 170,000 at \u201cMasters\u201d quality.\n\nSince the emergence of the CD\u2014the first popular digital format\u2014in the 1980s, there has been a running tension between convenience and audio quality\u2014a dynamic that has only intensified with the emergence of digital downloads and streaming. Some audiophiles complained that early CDs, in particular, suffered from poorer sound quality than vinyl records. Many still believe CDs, downloads and streams sound worse than vinyl.\n\n\u201cWe all have 50 million songs at the tip of our fingers and music\u2019s never been more convenient than it is today,\u201d Mr. Boom said. \u201cWhat\u2019s been lost in that march forward has been this sacrifice in audio quality.\u201d\n\nAmazon doesn\u2019t disclose how many music subscribers it has but people familiar with the matter said it recently had more than 34 million, which include a $9.99-a-month Amazon Music Unlimited service and the more limited Prime Music, which comes included with Prime memberships. Spotify leads globally, with 108 million, followed by Apple Music with more than 60 million.\n\nFrom the invention of the phonograph in 1877 to the boom in streaming services today, the music industry has had to constantly adapt to emerging technology. In this video, we explore whether music can continue to reinvent itself to survive.

At that time, Spotify said it had 30 million paying subscribers and Apple Music had 11 million.\n\nRecord business executives are more optimistic about Amazon\u2019s prospects with high-definition audio, especially as it taps its appeal to the mainstream.\n\nThe new tier has earned the approval of rocker Neil Young, who has advocated for higher-quality audio since the introduction of digital music\u2014even launching a high-resolution streaming service for his own music last year. \u201cThis will be the biggest thing to happen in music since the introduction of digital audio 40 years ago,\u201d he said in a statement provided by Amazon.\n\nWrite to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com", "description": "Amazon is introducing a high-resolution version of its music service, making it the first major subscription-streaming player to offer digital sound quality at CD quality or better.", "authors": ["Anne Steele", "Anne.Steele Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107556/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
