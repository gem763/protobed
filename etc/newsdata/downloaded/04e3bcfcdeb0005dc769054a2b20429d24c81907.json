In the turbulent early 1990s, male life expectancy was just 57.\n\nIn 2016, Russians drank 11.7 litres of alcohol per capita per year. By contrast, Germans drank 13.4 litres of alcohol the same year.\n\n'More civilised'\n\nIn a central Moscow bar that specialises in beer, drinkers said they thought people were cutting down partly because of the restrictions, particularly on late-night alcohol sales in shops, but also due to changing lifestyles.\n\n\"We drink less, at least some of us,\" Alexander Sukhontsov, a 28-year-old bank employee told the AFP news agency, adding that people's busy schedules mean they \"just don't have the time\".\n\n\"People have changed their approach to drinking,\" said Roman Pechnikov, a 38-year-old computer scientist.\n\n\"Bars have become more civilised, and people do not drink until the end of the night,\" he said.\n\nThe last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, was so concerned at habitual drinking among workers that he led a massively unpopular anti-alcohol campaign with partial prohibition, which brought down consumption from the mid-1980s until 1990.\n\nBut after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, alcohol consumption exploded, continuing to rise until the start of the 2000s. Former President Boris Yeltsin was also notorious for embarrassing public incidents that appeared to be alcohol-fuelled.\n\nBy contrast, Putin is almost never seen drinking in public, although he is not teetotal and this month raised a glass of vodka while visiting the North Caucasus.\n\nEarlier WHO figures showed Russian adults now drink less alcohol on average than their French and German counterparts.\n\nMoscow has also launched a drive against smoking, last week announcing a ban on lighting up even on private balconies.\n\nTobacco use plummeted by more than a fifth between 2009 and 2016, down to 30 percent of Russians smoking, according to the most recent Global Adult Tobacco Survey.", "description": "Alcohol consumption has dropped more than 40 percent since the turn of the millennium, the WHO reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/d11c6ec861604a6cb0433a51e40b23f3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
