After being selected in the 10th round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft, Cyr worked his way up to Triple-A in 2019.\n\nWhile Cyr has moved closer to his dream every season, those minor-league promotions haven\u2019t come with big pay increases. To show just how little minor-league baseball players make per season, Cyr posted a picture of his paycheck on Twitter on Monday.\n\nHere\u2019s a final pay stub of a TRIPLE-A national champion \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/3yoK5TuLgE \u2014 Tyler Cyr (@tycyr93) October 7, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCyr felt compelled to post that picture after seeing a tweet about Minnesota Twins reliever Randy Dobnak. The 24-year-old Dobnak caught national attention after pitching against the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series. During spring training \u2014 before he had reached the majors \u2014 Dobnak drove an Uber to make ends.\n\nThe 26-year-old Cyr said he wasn\u2019t sure whether Dobnak\u2019s story should be viewed as \u201ccool or embarrassing.\u201d Cyr tagged both @MLB and @MiLB in his tweet to get the point across. That inspired him to post a thread about minor-league pay.\n\nCyr began the thread by earnestly saying he was \u201cextremely grateful\u201d to be a part of the Giants. He then posted the picture of his paycheck. That was followed by Cyr saying he\u2019s actually had to pay to play baseball every season since he was drafted.\n\nStory continues\n\nI was drafted in 2015. Every season since , I have PAID to play baseball. This year I paid -$487.64 (which is the highest of my career previously 2016 -$94, 2017 -$112, 2018 +$1250 rehabbed an injury) \u2014 Tyler Cyr (@tycyr93) October 7, 2019\n\nCyr then posted the jobs he\u2019s held during the offseason, which include landscaping, working at Lululemon and serving food. Cyr then says he knows there are others out there who aren\u2019t as fortunate as him. He knows he\u2019s lucky to be in this position, even if it\u2019s not ideal.\n\nTo cap it all off, Cyr posts a screenshot of an article from 2015 that boasts MLB is worth $36 billion.\n\nMLB has lobbied to keep minor-league pay low. Minor leaguers are considered seasonal employees or apprentices. That designation allows teams to pay minor leaguers less than the minimum wage. Some minor leaguers have attempted to challenge that system, suing MLB for wage discrimination. That lawsuit, which was originally filed in 2014, is still being sorted out.\n\nWhile MLB players are protected by the MLB Players Association, minor leaguers are not part of the union. It\u2019s unclear whether that will change when the current collective-bargaining agreement ends following the 2020 season.\n\nThere have been rumblings a strike could occur, as MLB players haven\u2019t been happy with the way free agency has gone in recent seasons. Given that, and a number of other issues MLB players may want to change, minor league players like Cyr could find themselves getting left behind once again in negotiations.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
