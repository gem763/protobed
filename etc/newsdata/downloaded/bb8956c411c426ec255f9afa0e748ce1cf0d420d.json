(Photo: Jeep Brand| Huge Detroit)\n\nJeep fans take their vehicles seriously, and they don\u2019t stomach any imposters, especially any little blue ones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Jeep thing,\u201d as they say.\n\nSo it was welcome news to many when Apple ended a sacrilege with its most recent smartphone software update. The little blue vehicle emoji that would pop up as a suggestion whenever you typed \"Jeep\" for your iPhone texts is gone with the latest version, iOS 13.1.2.\n\nAn article last week in Ad Age noted that the emoji \"still appears when generic phrases like \u2018SUV\u2019 and \u2018car\u2019 and \u2018automobile\u2019 are typed.\"\n\nIn a nod, with a twist to a Jeep Wrangler claim, one Twitter user said simply, \u201cLeast capable emoji ever. Good riddance!\u201d The Wrangler version of that phrase, of course, has to do with it being the \u201cmost capable SUV.\u201d\n\nNaturally, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has seized the opportunity presented by the change in order to run a social media campaign highlighting the brand\u2019s calling card. Some images, with the helpful hashtag \u201c#ThisIsNotJeep,\u201d show the little blue vehicle not crossing a couple of streams, either perched on a rock or with grille submerged, or simply stuck in the snow.\n\nGM/UAW strike: Scrambling to find auto parts, car dealers feel pinch\n\nA future with flying cars: Boeing and Porsche are teaming up, but why?\n\nIn another spot on Instagram, someone tries to complete a text about driving a Jeep Wrangler and getting progressively more frustrated when that little blue vehicle keeps popping up.\n\nThis little blue emoji \ud83d\ude99 is clearly not Trail Rated. So glad @Apple agrees and removed our name in the latest iOS update. #ThisIsNotJeeppic.twitter.com/RZ7uWPWffU \u2014 Jeep (@Jeep) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cThis is not Jeep,\u201d the spot says, showing the emoji. A moment later, a blue Wrangler bursts aggressively through some not-too-shallow water as the words, \u201cThis is,\u201d appear on the screen.\n\nAfter showing the full Jeep lineup parked in some desert-like location, wording on the end scene declares: \u201cJeep: Now emoji free.\u201d\n\nFCA Chief Marketing Officer Olivier Francois said in a statement that Jeep fans have voiced \u201cdismay\u201d over an emoji that \"misrepresented\" the brand.\n\n\"The Jeep brand is opposed to this emoji being connected with its name and we're happy the association has been removed from the latest iOS update. We\u2019re good-naturedly celebrating its demise with our owners and fans through this social media campaign, while firmly making it known that any SUV that does not carry the Jeep brand name cannot pass itself off as one of our vehicles,\u201d Francois said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why the change was made. Apple did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and FCA said it did not reach out to Apple.\n\nFCA is celebrating Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to drop the blue vehicle emoji connection to Jeep in iPhone texts with a campaign highlighting how the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imposter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is not a Jeep.
