We came here on the back foot, but we pulled through.\"\n\nAfter winning his last two titles in Mexico without even finishing on the podium, it was ironic for Hamilton to win but know he has to wait for a sixth coronation.\n\n\"I enjoyed it,\" said Bottas, who survived a heavy crash in qualifying on Saturday. \"Considering what happened yesterday, it's a good result\u2026 I don't think we could have done much more.\"\n\nHamilton added: \"I don't mind not winning the title here. I can wait. I just love racing and I am happy to take each race as it comes.\"\n\nFour-time champion Vettel said: \"It was a long race with no break, but I think Lewis was just cruising for most of his second sting. I'm happy, but we could have had a sharper strategy.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Lewis Hamilton drove to a near-flawless victory, but not yet a sixth drivers' world championship on Sunday when he claimed his 10th win of the season for Mercedes at the Mexican Grand Prix.
