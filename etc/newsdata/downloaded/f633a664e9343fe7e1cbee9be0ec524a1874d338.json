The leak, which was discovered on October 19, was plugged on the same day by Adobe upon alerting the company.\n\n\u201cLate last week, Adobe became aware of a vulnerability related to work on one of our prototype environments. We promptly shut down the misconfigured environment, addressing the vulnerability,\u201d Adobe said.\n\nThe exposed database included details like email addresses, account creation dates, subscribed products, subscription statuses, payment statuses, member IDs, country of origin, time since last login, and whether they were Adobe employees.\n\nWith an estimated 15 million subscribers, Adobe Creative Cloud is a monthly subscription that gives users access to a suite of popular Adobe products such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro, Audition, After Effects, and many others.\n\nAlthough there were no passwords or financial information in the database, the consequence of such exposure is the increased possibility of targeted spear-phishing attacks.\n\n\u201cFraudsters could pose as Adobe or a related company and trick users into giving up further info, such as passwords, for example,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe incident is not the only time instances of leaky servers have drawn headlines. In recent months, Ecuadorian and Russian citizens, and US government personnel have had their personal info left unprotected on Elasticsearch servers, underscoring that there\u2019s still a long way to go when it comes to cloud security.", "description": "Adobe has become the latest victim of a serious serious security breach that exposed information of nearly 7.5 million users of Creative Cloud service.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F10%2FnNpOvs0-1.jpg&signature=bab4f6d8b1288d3c25b61957994246b4", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
