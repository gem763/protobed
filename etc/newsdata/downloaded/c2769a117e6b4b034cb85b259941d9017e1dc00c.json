Richard Burgon, a Labour lawmaker, said that his party would be pushing to allow E.U. citizens and 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the election.\n\nAD\n\nBut even if these changes aren\u2019t approved, \u201cwhen push comes to shove we\u2019re going to support a general election because people in our country deserve better than Boris Johnson and the Tories. They believe they are born to rule, they are going to now find out that they are not.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe movement is a bit of rare good news for Johnson. The prime minister suffered two political drubbings on Monday: He was forced to grudgingly accept the European Union\u2019s offer to delay Brexit until January, and then lost a motion in Parliament to stage a general election before Christmas.\n\nJohnson wants an election so he can have a chance to regain his lost parliamentary majority and fulfill his broken promise to get Brexit done, \u201cdo or die.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAcross the country, there is a widespread view that this Parliament has run its course,\u201d Johnson told lawmakers Monday.\n\nHe fell far short of the two-thirds majority he needed for his early-election motion in Monday\u2019s vote. Labour, the largest opposition party, has resisted the election push, and its lawmakers mostly abstained in the vote.\n\nSpeaking immediately afterward, the prime minister said, \u201cWe will not allow this paralysis to continue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlong with Labour\u2019s backing for a snap election, Johnson is aided by two anti-Brexit opposition parties \u2014 the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party \u2014 who want to go to the polls now.\n\nIn remarks that resembled a campaign speech, Johnson on Monday blamed Parliament, including rebel lawmakers from his Conservative Party, for blocking Brexit \u2014 again.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey made it inevitable that the people of this country would be retained in the E.U., against their will, for at least another three months, at a cost of another billion pounds a month,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cThey just want to delay Brexit and cancel Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nCorbyn responded that Johnson was flailing and failing to keep his word.\n\n\u201cThis is a prime minister who cannot be trusted,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nCorbyn criticized Johnson for spending $129 million of public money on an advertising campaign urging Britons to \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d on Oct. 31.\n\nAD\n\nThe opposition leader also noted that Britain hasn\u2019t had a general election in dark and dreary December since 1923.\n\nAD\n\nCorbyn said that a Dec. 12 election would have the effect of suppressing votes \u2014 discouraging participation by students who have left school for the holidays and elderly folk who might be less willing to vote on a day when the sun sets so early, at 3:50 p.m.\n\nLabour\u2019s initial reluctance to back elections, analysts say, is related to uncertainty about how the party would fare. Some within the upper ranks of the party want to go for it, believing that Corbyn is a proven campaigner. Others fear that the party\u2019s messy position on Brexit may not go down well on the doorsteps.\n\nRecent polling puts Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party 10 points ahead of Labour.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, as Theresa May, Johnson\u2019s predecessor, knows only too well, polls can shift dramatically over the course of a campaign. In the last general election, in 2017, May went in expecting to get a clear majority and mandate, but ended up losing her parliamentary majority instead.\n\nAD\n\nDuring Johnson\u2019s tenure, as long as the thrust of the opposition effort was to block a chaotic no-deal exit, Labour was able to hold together smaller opposition parties, as well as some members of Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, to frustrate the prime minister\u2019s plans. But now that the threat of a no-deal Brexit has receded, the members of that alliance have diverged in their priorities.\n\nIn tweets, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, explained why she was supporting an early general election.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor all his bluster, Johnson would much prefer to fight an election with Brexit already \u2018delivered,\u2019 \u201d Sturgeon wrote. \u201cAn election now would instead force him to explain his failure to keep his 31 October \u2018do or die\u2019 promise and also defend his bad deal.\u201d", "description": "If Parliament agrees to go the polls in December, the vote will be dominated by Brexit.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom", "William Booth", "London Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8aw_0dU1xRfDS2hk6qckfWTGq7w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/67OQP4H2I4I6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
