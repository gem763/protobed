It's a major shot off the bow at Netflix [NFLX], Disney [DIS] and others.\u201d\n\nBut the big question remains, where will the content come from?\n\nApple\u2019s Content Arms Race\n\nWe know Apple has several original shows in the pipeline: \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d starring Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell, \u201cDickinson\u201d with Hailee Steinfeld, and \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d an alternate history about the space race.\n\nAt Apple\u2019s big event Tuesday, where it also announced new iPhones, Apple Watch and iPads, CEO Tim Cook also announced a fourth show, \u201cSee\u201d starring Jason Momoa.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook announces Apple TV+ during an new product event Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2019, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) More\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a content arms race,\u201d Ives said. \u201cRight now, Apple has built a house, they\u2019ve priced it accordingly. They need to fill it with content and we think that\u2019s going to be the next trick up the sleeve for Cook in terms of bigger M&A.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig Acquisition\u201d in Apple\u2019s Future\n\n\u201cWe think a big acquisition is on the horizon,\u201d Ives said.\n\nOn his list of acquisitions (in order); A24 Studio, Lionsgate, Viacom/CBS [CBS], Sony Pictures, MGM Studios, Netflix, and then a potential gaming publisher (that could be incorporated into Apple\u2019s streaming service or a separate gaming subscription service) as a wild card.\n\nIves says the upside to Apple and its investors remain high.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe this is the star of the next chapter of growth,\u201d Ives said. \u201cThe one thing that is missing is content and that\u2019s why we do think organically they are going to significantly step up content.\u201d\n\nTracey Marx Bernstein is a senior producer for Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Apple TV + is price affordably but it really needs to focus on content to win the OTT race.", "authors": ["Tracey Marx Bernstein", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SRrSfdKL_pdFN_BbM49jWA--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/8278d0a0-d3e8-11e9-bfff-05ec85bb493d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
