Fifteen people were killed, including 11 engineers working on the submarine contract.\n\nAl-Qaeda was initially suspected of the attack, but the focus later shifted to the arms deal as investigators considered whether the bombing may have been revenge for the non-payment of promised bribes after Chirac pipped Balladur in the vote and cancelled the payment of commissions.\n\nBalladur's lawyers on Tuesday said he was \"confident\" he would be cleared of any wrongdoing, \"given that he never committed any of the acts of which he is accused\".\n\nSix others facing trial in the case include Balladur's campaign manager Nicolas Bazire; Thierry Gaubert, who worked for Sarkozy, who was budget minister at the time; and a French-Lebanese middleman, Ziad Takieddine.\n\nThey will go on trial this month in a Paris criminal court.", "description": "Former president latest senior French politician swept up in anti-corruption investigations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/d82377825db34e36883218c7949fa46e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
