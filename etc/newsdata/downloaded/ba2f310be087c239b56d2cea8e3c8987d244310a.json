Here is a video:\n\nDefendTex staff told Business Insider that the drones are meant to float unassumingly in the sea, and are purposefully designed to look like squid as a type of camouflage.\n\nThe drones are meant to attach themselves to passing enemy vessels. They can then be detonated remotely by their operators. Each one can act by itself or as a swarm with others.\n\nDefendTex said the drones swim using a motor, and can recharge by sinking to the ocean floor, attaching themselves to rocks, and allowing ocean currents to rotate and internal motor which charges the battery.\n\nThe drones are meant to be used in Anti-Submarine Warfare missions or Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions, according to DefendTex.\n\nThe project is still in development, and is not yet on sale.\n\nRead more: Meet the first 2 sisters to ever become generals in the US Army's 244-year history\n\nDSEI is the UK's largest arms fair, attracting representatives from the world's 50 largest militaries, who come to view the latest defense and intelligence technology.\n\nOver 1,600 manufacturers attend the event, which in 2019 is at London's ExCel center.", "description": "\"Shard\" is shaped exactly like a squid, and is made by DefendTex, who put it on show at the UK's biggest gun show, DSEI, in London on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9342/7afacbaac830429ab811f8d62d22d0ba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
