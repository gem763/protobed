Why is she so short?\".\n\n'If they come and talk to me, I'll just explain: \"I was born with a type of dwarfism. It's not like a disease. You can't catch it. It's not going to do anything to you.\n\n''I am just like you, just with shorter limbs, that's it. I'm the same person as you\".'\n\nThe 29-year-old admitted that being of such short stature comes with challenges.\n\nThe 3ft dancer was born with cartilage-hair hypoplasia, which affected her bone development and has left her with short limbs\n\nJonna said she is often left explaining why she is small to strangers in the street, who can ask insensitive questions\n\nShe has to buy child-size clothing; her car has been specially adapted and she needs to use a mobility scooter for long distances.\n\nJonna said: 'The type of dwarfism I have is cartilage-hair hypoplasia, which means basically all my limbs are just smaller. It's a genetic disease so it's like a mutation.'\n\nAs well as being born of short stature, people with the condition typically have malformations in the cartilage near the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs, which in turn affects the bone development.\n\nTheir hair is also typically lighter in colour because of missing pigmentation.\n\nEven with her form of dwarfism, Jonna is particularly small in stature.\n\nJonna said one of her main challenges is walking, as her step size is a lot shorter than that of other average size people\n\nShe said: 'For me specifically, I think I'm a lot shorter than most dwarfs, so that can be a problem when it comes to trying to reach things, trying to find my way around like a grocery store.'\n\nShe explained: 'I have to specifically either ask someone to walk with me to get stuff or bring a friend. I think that I also live by stools like everywhere I go.\n\nWhat is Cartilage-hair hypoplasia? Cartilage-hair hypoplasia is a disorder of bone growth characterized by short stature (dwarfism) with other skeletal abnormalities; fine, sparse hair (hypotrichosis); and abnormal immune system function (immune deficiency) that can lead to recurrent infections. People with cartilage-hair hypoplasia have unusually short limbs and short stature from birth. They typically have malformations in the cartilage near the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs (metaphyseal chondrodysplasia), which then affects development of the bone itself. Most people with cartilage-hair hypoplasia are unusually flexible in some joints, but they may have difficulty extending their elbows fully.\n\n'Walking is more difficult because I'm so much shorter.'\n\nShe explained: 'It takes for one step as an average size about three for me, so I walk a lot more and I have to take a lot more breaks which is really hard sometimes.'\n\nJonna's own childhood was difficult; she was bullied from a young age and developed eating disorders as a result.\n\nShe said: 'Schooling for me was pretty bad. I was bullied probably my entire life.'\n\n'On top of being different, I would always be made fun of for my weight all the time and I feel like every girl goes through that but it was really bad.'\n\nFood became both a comfort and a destructive tool against Jonna as she alternated between binge eating and withholding from eating.\n\nJonna recalled: 'Food was a way for me to feel comforted when I couldn't feel that by myself.\n\n'So I used food a lot \u2013 either eating a lot or not eating at all as a way of controlling that part of my life when I couldn't control other people or anything else.'\n\nBy age 21 \u2013 even after therapy for her food disorders was starting to have an effect, Jonna moved away from home to go to college.\n\nShe explained: 'I turned 21 and I found alcohol and it was like this magical thing that helped me be this confident, awesome person.\n\nJonna said when she went to college she spent years drinking, which was like 'a magical thing' that gave her a boost of confidence to become an 'awesome person'\n\n'When I was drinking I felt like I could do anything, be anyone, talk to boys, like do whatever I wanted to do.\n\n'This whole alter ego came out. And so it was fun at first. And then it didn't become fun anymore.'\n\nJonna continued: 'The last three years before I got sober, all I did was blackout. Every time I drank.\n\n'I didn't drink all the time, but when I did drink, I blacked out and I never knew where I was, who I was with and that's pretty unsafe.\n\nJonna revealed she was left feeling suicidal after she became dependent on alcohol following years of bullying\n\n'I was very depressed, suicidal, like just really bad. And I just didn't want to feel that way anymore.'\n\nAfter interventions from friends and family Jonna went to rehab and has now been sober for almost three years.\n\nA big part of Jonna's recovery was dance. Having loved to dance as a child she had stopped aged 13, believing, she wasn't the right size to be a dancer.\n\nShe said: 'I've loved dancing ever since I was little. When I was six years old, I started dancing. I did ballet, I did tap dancing, I did jazz and hip hop.\n\nJonna now uses dance to express herself and said the experience has transformed how she feels about her body\n\nDespite having a passion for dance throughout her life, Jonna said she felt discouraged from the hobby as a child as she didn't look like other dancers\n\n'And then when I was about 12 or 13, I stopped because I realized that if I wanted to continue dancing in the studio, I don't look like the dancers and I was told that I was never going to be a dancer because of how I looked from a teacher.'\n\nEarly on in her sobriety Jonna once again found herself going to a dance class.\n\nShe said: 'It helped me again figure out how much confidence I have in myself and like what I can actually do and I could actually do this.'\n\nDance became a way to express herself; Jonna started posting videos from her classes, which soon got the attention of some very famous viewers.\n\nNow she often joins dance classes with other, average size people and says that dancing has helped her to accept herself\n\nThe 29-year-old also said she was determined to help others embrace themselves, as she said: 'Everyone should wear a bikini and feel confident'\n\n'I just kept getting so many views and followers. All the responses were amazing. So I was like, 'Oh, okay, maybe I am good at this!' And then it blew up from there. Chris Brown posted one and Snoop Dogg posted one and I was like: 'What is happening?!'\n\nMost recently Jonna was asked to model for a swimsuit company.\n\nShe said: 'It made me feel so empowered by women. I think everyone has this feeling of a bathing suit or a bikini \u2013 like only certain people should wear it.\n\n'And it's like, that's not the case - everyone should wear a bikini and feel confident.'\n\nJonna said she now feels more free than ever, and has finally been able to 'let go' and accept who she is\n\nEventually Jonna, who just graduated from California State University, Northridge with a bachelors in Child and Adolescent Development, wants to become a children's therapist.\n\nShe believes her path has helped her learn to love herself - and she wants to enable other young people to do the same.\n\nShe said: 'I would say that being a dwarf was the reason why I drink because I never accepted who I fully am. And once I did that, it like freed me from everything.\n\n'And so being sober literally saved my life because I finally got to let go of all that and be whoever I want to be and not care what other people think.'", "description": "Jonna Ross, also known as Lil Miss Ross, 29,\u00a0 from California, was left feeling depressed and suicidal after years of bullying and torment over her 3ft size.
