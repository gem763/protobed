Kram\u2019s account of the third Ali-Joe Frazier fight, The Thrilla in Manilla, is one of the finest deadline pieces of magazine writing ever, and not just in the world of sports.\n\nBut as is demonstrated by the writing in Great Men Die Twice, the new anthology of Kram\u2019s work, he was equally skillful when delving into subjects beyond the sweet science. His portrait of Marlon Brando is fascinating, as is the following profile of former DEA agent Michael Levine, which was originally published in the March 1991 issue of Esquire and is reprinted here with permission. Please sink your teeth into \u201cThe Betrayal of Michael Levine\u201d for a glimpse of Kram\u2019s talents as a storyteller. Then cop Great Men Die Twice. It\u2019s a keeper.\n\n\u2014Alex Belth", "description": "For most of the \u201980s Michael Levine was a high-voltage player in America\u2019s drug wars, until he became convinced that the government\u2019s efforts were misguided and useless.", "authors": ["Mark Kram"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492179366/articles/2015/07/12/the-stacks-a-dea-agent-at-war-with-the-war-on-drugs/150710-stacks-dea-agent-tease_mz22gd", "published_at": "2015-07-12"}
