These would vest into that number of shares (for free) should certain hurdles be met. Or more easily, if the company changes hands. Their face value, at Friday's $31.85 share price, is $48.2 million.\n\nIt's been an eventful 14 years since Wolgen \u2013 a would-be professional soccer player, trained facial surgeon and former equities analyst \u2013 took over running the little-known ASX-listed company. It's attracted investors from offshore heavyweights (such as Fidelity and Napster founder Sean Parker), gate-crashed into the ASX200, fought off a takeover from notorious hedge fund 'pharma bro' Martin Shkreli and, perhaps most importantly, received approval from the US Food & Drug Administration for its extreme light sensitivity treatment Scenesse earlier this month.\n\nIf shareholders are generous and Clinuvel's current growth trajectory keeps up, Dr Phillippe Wolgen stands to make millions. Nicole Emanuel\n\nThat last, much-anticipated approval briefly pushed Clinuvel's share price to $45 a pop and made it a $2.2 billion pharma titan (that few had ever heard of).\n\nIf shareholders are in a generous mood next month, and no change of control transaction leads to the board deciding to immediately vest the lot, a small number of the performance rights (116,250) will vest after what the board deems to be \"exceptional and unexpected performances\". So, ultimately, at their discretion.\n\nThe rest are reliant on more traditional hurdles. A third will vest if the company is worth $7.5 billion in market capitalisation. Which looks tricky, but this is a company whose value has grown more than eightfold in the past five years. And, if achieved, that $7.5 billion valuation would make those 1.5 million performance shares worth $231.7 million.", "description": "If shareholders are generous and Clinuvel's current growth trajectory keeps up, Dr Phillippe Wolgen stands to make millions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7209%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_129%2C$y_350/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b3d6ee7b0d8ace15f55e34570d477a946d315c1c", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
