This year, state Sen. Dan Bishop replaced Harris on the ballot. Bishop is running against Democrat Dan McCready in the election to be held on Tuesday.\n\nThe State Board of Elections closed a number of voting sites in Bladen, Cumberland, Robeson and Scotland counties on Wednesday, Thursday and possibly Friday once the board\u2019s executive director assesses storm conditions, Raleigh\u2019s News & Observer reported.\n\nEarly voting sites remained open in the district\u2019s two counties with the largest number of registered voters \u2014 Union and Mecklenburg, where Charlotte is located. The state\u2019s Democratic Party called for the board to extend early voting hours through the weekend and into Monday in order to make up for lost time during the closures.\n\nSUPREME COURT SAYS FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE NO ROLE IN POLICING GERRYMANDERING, LEAVING POLITICAL MAPS IN PLACE\n\n\n\n\"I think that if the hours are not extended to match the hours that have been lost due to the closures, then it very well have an impact,\" Wayne Goodwin, chairman of North Carolina's Democratic Party, told The Hill. \"We had seen this before in 2016 with the hurricane that struck just mere weeks before the November elections.\"\n\n\n\nBoth the GOP and the Democratic candidate vying for vacant congressional seat vouched for early voting extension to ensure this year\u2019s election goes off without a hitch. North Carolina\u2019s elections recently faced another type of scrutiny after a North Carolina trial court has rejected state legislative district maps, saying GOP lawmakers took extreme advantage to help elect a maximum number of Republicans. Both chambers of North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly are led by the Republican Party.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has been an election where the voters have faced every type of obstacle, from gerrymandering to absentee ballot fraud to a hurricane last fall that displaced thousands of voters,\u201d McCready told the News & Observer. \u201cNow the voters face another hurricane, which threatens to keep thousands more from being able to cast their sacred right to vote.\u201d\n\n\n\nBishop's campaign said in a statement: \"Our goal is to ensure every eligible voter in the 9th Congressional District has the opportunity to exercise his or her right to vote, and a districtwide extension of early voting into Saturday would help ensure no one is disenfranchised.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\n\nVice President Pence and Donald Trump Jr. will also visit the area as part of a push to rally Republican support, Politico reported. The Trump campaign announced this week it had donated the maximum $2,000 to Bishop.
