(AP) - Frank Gore isn\u2019t sure he would have signed with the Buffalo Bills this offseason if not for being coaxed into it by his long-time friend LeSean McCoy.\n\nDevin Singletary, meantime, could barely contain his initial excitement over the prospect of meeting Gore and McCoy in person upon being drafted in the third round by the Bills in April.\n\nLittle did either anticipate they would be the ones taking over the primary running back duties heading into Buffalo\u2019s season opener at the Jets on Sunday after McCoy was released last weekend.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the reasons why I did come. He talked to me and he wanted me to come here and compete with him,\u201d Gore said of McCoy, who has since signed with Kansas City, where he is reunited with his former coach Andy Reid.\n\n\u201cIt was tough, but we also knew it was a business. I\u2019m happy for him,\u201d Gore added. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also happy for me and my teammates in our room that we get a chance to work together and compete, and help our team be successful.\u201d\n\nRather than share carries with the 31-year-old McCoy in a backfield that would\u2019ve featured two of the NFL\u2019s most productive players, the 36-year-old Gore is instead preparing to open his 15th season working with Singletary.\n\nAnd that\u2019s fine with Gore.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s active leader in yards rushing not only spent much of the offseason mentoring the 21-year-old, but also knew of Singletary\u2019s abilities when he was leading the nation in scoring during his sophomore season at Florida Atlantic in 2017.\n\n\u201cGreat kid, man. Very natural. He understands the game and works his behind off and listens,\u201d said Gore, who was first made aware of Singletary by Florida Atlantic\u2019s running backs coach, former NFLer Kevin Smith. \u201cI\u2019m rooting for him and also competing with him, trying to keep him hungry and get him better.\u201d\n\nSingletary didn\u2019t initially know what to make of McCoy being cut, before coming to the realization he\u2019s in line for a far more expanded role.\n\n\u201cI definitely didn\u2019t see this coming,\u201d Singletary said. \u201cIt shows that they believe in me. Now it\u2019s time to see how it turns out.\u201d\n\nCoach Sean McDermott hasn\u2019t revealed his plans at running back, which will be rounded out with T.J. Yeldon, expected to play a role in third-down passing situations.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is how Gore and Singletary are being relied upon to boost a running attack that stagnated under McCoy and behind a patchwork offensive line this season.\n\nGore has plenty to prove in coming off an injury-shortened season in which he played 14 games and finished with 722 yards rushing - his fewest since his rookie year. With 14,748 career yards rushing, Gore is 522 from passing Barry Sanders for third on the NFL list.\n\nThe decision to release McCoy after four seasons in Buffalo eventually came down to Singletary\u2019s development this offseason. Though undersized, the 5-foot-7, 200-pound player has been fearless in running up the middle and impressive in not going down after the first hit. More important, Singletary was adept in catching passes out of the backfield, something he wasn\u2019t asked to do much in college.\n\nSingletary\u2019s six catches in three preseason games matched his total last year, and included an 18-yard over-the-shoulder reception made in a 27-14 win over Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe knew he could run with the ball in his hands. I talked about his vision and his instincts and feel. I think it was when he checked the box on the passing game,\u201d general manager Brandon Beane said, referring to what stood out about Singletary this summer.\n\nThat went beyond Beane\u2019s initial thoughts in drafting Singletary, referring to him as being \u201cthe funnest guy\u201d he had scouted last year because of the player\u2019s speed, vision and shiftiness.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call him a home-run hitter, but he can make guys miss in a phone booth,\u201d Beane said of Singletary, who finished with 714 carries for 4,287 yards rushing and scored 67 touchdowns, including one receiving.\n\nSingletary drew comparisons to McCoy at college for having similar running styles. He\u2019s also a big fan of Gore.\n\n\u201cFrank is one of the greats,\u201d Singletary said, recalling how Smith would have him watch film of Gore. \u201cHe used to put on Frank\u2019s tapes just to show his contact balance, how he finds his way through cloudy situations, when there\u2019s no hole there and how you\u2019ve got to make something.\u201d\n\nAs for McCoy, he showed Singletary how to stay motivated.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to come in and never get comfortable,\u201d Singletary said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen (McCoy) comfortable. He always came in and worked. And that\u2019s definitely something I took from him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Frank Gore isn't sure he would have signed with the Buffalo Bills this offseason if not for being coaxed into it by his long-time friend LeSean McCoy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/bills_replacing_mccoy_football_11869_c0-181-4325-2702_s1770x1032.jpg?3ad6f3cb8a9fa6a0e707eb490b798233b5273532"}
