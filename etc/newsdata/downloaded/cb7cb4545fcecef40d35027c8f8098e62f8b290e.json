But we are not in a vacuum; we are in Trump\u2019s world of stupidity, avarice, and transactionality.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the Baghdadi operation\u2014which was complicated by Trump\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from northern Syria\u2014gave him second thoughts about that withdrawal, he said it was about the oil (bolded emphasis mine):\n\nLook, we don\u2019t want to keep soldiers between Syria and Turkey for the next 200 years. They have been fighting for hundreds of years. We\u2019re out. But we are leaving soldiers to secure the oil. Now, we may have to fight for the oil. That\u2019s OK. Maybe somebody else wants the oil, in which case they have a hell of a fight. But there\u2019s massive amounts of oil. And we\u2019re securing it for a couple of reasons. Number one, it stops ISIS, because ISIS got tremendous wealth from that oil. We have taken it. It\u2019s secured. Number two\u2014and, again, somebody else may claim it, but either we will negotiate a deal with whoever is claiming it, if we think it\u2019s fair, or we will militarily stop them very quickly.\n\nWhen asked who else he wanted to thank for their counsels on the Baghdadi operation, Trump briefly mentioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, then expounded on oil and the companies he\u2019d like to use to distribute it, because the U.S. deserves war spoils:\n\nI don\u2019t want to leave 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 soldiers on the border. But where Lindsey and I totally agree is the oil. The oil is, you know, so valuable. For many reasons. It fueled ISIS, number one. Number two, it helps the Kurds, because it\u2019s basically been taken away from the Kurds. They were able to live with that oil. And number three, it can help us, because we should be able to take some also. And what I intend to do, perhaps, is make a deal with an ExxonMobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly. Right now it\u2019s not big. It\u2019s big oil underground but it\u2019s not big oil up top. Much of the machinery has been shot and dead. It\u2019s been through wars. But\u2014and\u2014and spread out the wealth. But no, we\u2019re protecting the oil, we\u2019re securing the oil. Now that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t make a deal at some point. But I don\u2019t want to be\u2014they\u2019re\u2014they\u2019re fighting for 1,000 years, they\u2019re fighting for centuries. I want to bring our soldiers back home, but I do want to secure the oil. If you read about the history of Donald Trump, I was a civilian. I had absolutely nothing to do with going into Iraq and I was totally against it. But I always used to say if they\u2019re going to go in\u2014nobody cared that much but it got written about\u2014if they\u2019re going to go in\u2014I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the statement because I made it more than any human being alive. If they\u2019re going into Iraq, keep the oil. They never did. They never did.\n\nWhen asked about the pitfalls of his Syria withdrawal, Trump argued that the lives of people in the Middle East were less valuable to him than securing and extracting fossil fuels for profit. \u201cNow, I will secure the oil. That happens to be in a certain part. But that\u2019s tremendous money involved. I would love to\u2014you know, the oil in\u2014I mean, I will tell you a story in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a Syria pullout.\u201d He continued:\n\nI just don\u2019t want to guard Turkey and Syria for the rest of our lives. I mean, I don\u2019t want to do it. It\u2019s very expensive. It\u2019s very dangerous. They have been fighting for centuries. I don\u2019t want to have my people, 2,000 men and women, or 1,000, or 28. We had 28 guarding. I said, I don\u2019t want them there anyway. I don\u2019t want them. I heard recently that Iraq, over the last number of years, actually discriminates against America in oil leases. In other words, some oil companies from other countries, after all we\u2019ve done, have an advantage in Iraq for the oil. I said keep the oil. Give them what they need, keep the oil. Why should we\u2014we go in, we lose thousands of lives, spend trillions of dollars, and our companies don\u2019t even have an advantage in getting the oil leases.\n\nTrump\u2019s oil obsession isn\u2019t entirely his fault: His military advisers, already spinning from having indulged his ill-informed edicts on Korean military exercises, Iranian strike plans, the Space Force, transgender service members, deployments to the Mexico border, and a military parade, now contended with a disastrous Syria withdrawal that endangered U.S. troops and fostered criminal atrocities by invading forces. So they pleaded to keep U.S. troops in place by appealing to Trump\u2019s penchant for petroleum, saying the derricks and fields needed to be protected from enemies. \u201cThis is like feeding a baby its medicine in yogurt or applesauce,\u201d one U.S. official said\u2014a distressing comment on the weakness of civilian controls over the military under a proven half-wit civilian commander.", "description": "In celebrating the death of ISIS's leader, Trump shared his vision of America's goal in the Middle East: loot and plunder.", "authors": ["Adam Weinstein"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/5286da0857431d092fc26f4dd3505624352d2396.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
