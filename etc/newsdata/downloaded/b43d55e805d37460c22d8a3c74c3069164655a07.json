(AP) - Zack Moss declared his return in a striking way.\n\nHe rushed for 121 yards and two touchdowns, including a 91-yard scoring run in the opening quarter, and No. 15 Utah routed Oregon State 52-7 on Saturday night.\n\nMoss, who was returning from a shoulder injury, sat out the second half. He is now just 55 yards from passing Eddie Johnson (1984-88) as the Utes\u2019 leading career rusher.\n\n\u201cIt feels good just to be back with the guys,\u201d Moss said. \u201cJust trying to go out there and do my job. Was fortunate to have a big run and things like that. So it was good just to be back out there.\u201d\n\nTyler Huntley threw for 247 yards and two touchdowns for the Utes (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12), who were coming off a bye after downing Washington State to rebound from their lone loss the week before to USC.\n\nMoss missed the game against the Cougars with the injury. If his night against the Beavers was any indication, he\u2019s certainly over it now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling good to go each and every day,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Beavers (2-4, 1-2) were coming off a 48-31 victory over UCLA at the Rose Bowl last weekend, just their second win this year and first victory over a Pac-12 opponent since last season.\n\nQuarterback Jake Luton, chosen Pac-12 Player of the Week after accounting for six touchdowns (five pass, one run) against the Bruins, threw for 131 yards but was intercepted for the first time this season.\n\nReceiver Isaiah Hodgins, who went into the game ranked second in the nation with an average of 126.4 receiving yards per game, was held to eight catches for 77 yards by the stout Utah defense.\n\nThe Utes, ranked 14th in the nation among FBS teams for total defense going into the game, also held Oregon State to just 48 rushing yards.\n\nIt was the Beavers\u2019 worst home loss since 1991, when they fell to Washington 58-6.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else we can do, other than to just keep fighting,\u201d Luton said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to come back, we\u2019re going to be here tomorrow, back in building, we\u2019re going to watch the film, we\u2019re going to be back on the field correcting the stuff that we did wrong, and we\u2019re going to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nUtah center Orlando Umana was flagged for targeting and ejected on the Utes\u2019 opening drive. Huntley hit Brant Kuithe with a 21-yard touchdown pass on the drive to take the early lead before Moss\u2018 statement-making touchdown run, the third-longest in Utes\u2019 history, and the fourth-longest play from scrimmage and longest since 2004.\n\nIt was the longest touchdown run ever scored against the Beavers.\n\nHuntley added a 3-yard touchdown pass to Samson Nacua to make it 21-0 before the end of the first quarter.\n\nUtah\u2019s Devin Lloyd scored on a 64-yard interception return. Luton was sitting at 181 passes without an interception and leading the nation before Lloyd\u2019s pick. He was one pass away from tying Matt Moore for the school record.\n\nMoss added a 6-yard touchdown run with less than a minute to go before halftime to give the Utes a 34-0 lead.\n\n\u201cZack\u2019s still not 100 percent, but he did a great job for us. Five carries, a hundred-something yards, and the 90-yarder was impressive. It shows you what kind of speed he has. He\u2019s 220 pounds and really did a nice job,\u201d coach Kyle Whittingham said.\n\nDevin Brumfield ran for a 1-yard touchdown in the third quarter to push Utah\u2019s lead to 42-0 before freshman Jordan Wilmore had his first career TD on a 7-yard scoring run.\n\nHuntley was replaced by backup Jason Shelley for the fourth quarter. Jadon Redding had a 42-yard field goal for the Utes with 9:34 left.\n\nOregon State avoided the shutout with Tristan Gebbia\u2019s 15-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Tyler with 56 second left.\n\nMoss said he\u2019s looking forward to setting the rushing record - perhaps as soon as next week at home against Arizona State.\n\n\u201cIt will be a good experience next week to have my mom and dad come to the game,\u201d he said. \u201cI was kind of happy I was able to get out (of this game) early and have the opportunity next week.\u201d\n\nUtah has won four straight against the Beavers.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUtah: It was Moss\u2018 14th 100-yard game, tying the Utah record also held by John White and Devontae Booker. \u2026 Eddie Johnson had 3,219 rushing yards for the Utes. Moss is at 3,165. \u2026 . \u2026 Huntley has yet to throw an interception this season. He has a streak of 133 passes without a pick\u2026 Utah is one of just three teams that hasn\u2019t thrown an interception this season.\n\nOregon State: The Beavers were one of just three teams nationwide that hadn\u2019t lost a fumble this season. \u2026 The Beavers most lopsided loss to the Utes before Saturday came in 1992, when Utah won 42-9 in Salt Lake City.\n\nMORE SUPERLATIVES: Utah\u2019s 42-point margin of victory was its largest since joining the Pac-12. The team\u2019s 52 points are the most they\u2019ve scored since 54 against San Jose State in 2017.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUtah: The Utes host Arizona State on Saturday. The Sun Devils downed Washington State 38-34 on Saturday.\n\nOregon State visits California on Saturday. The Golden Bears had a bye this weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Zack Moss declared his return in a striking way.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
