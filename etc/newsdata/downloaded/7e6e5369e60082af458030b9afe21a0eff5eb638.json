The Russian leader (right), pictured with Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Sochi yesterday, has won praise from the Kurds for his intervention in Syria\n\nRussian presence: Putin's soldiers

deploys his troops to parts of the country where they have not been seen in years\n\nWith American troops gone, Russia is now the major power-broker in Syria - another boost to Assad who counts Putin as a close ally.\n\nYesterday Putin hosted dozens of African leaders at a summit in Sochi as Moscow seeks to spread its influence across Africa and the Middle East.\n\nRussian troops crossed the Euphrates River in Syria on Wednesday to start patrolling the area alongside Syrian forces.\n\nPatrols have already begun near the city of Manbij, where U.S. troops were manning a base until two weeks ago.\n\nThe Russians also entered the city of Kobani in a particularly symbolic blow to the Kurds, who fought ISIS for control of it in 2014-15.\n\nRussian military police and Syrian border guards will 'facilitate the removal' of Kurdish fighters and their weapons from within 18 miles of the border.\n\nThis withdrawal must be finalised within 150 hours, according to a text of the agreement released after the talks.\n\nMoscow's deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin said he hoped the Kurds would go voluntarily, avoiding the dire fate predicted by the Kremlin which said they would be 'mauled' by Turkish forces if they remained in the zone.\n\nHowever, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said Kurdish civilians would not have to leave their homes, amid fears of 'ethnic cleansing' in the region.\n\nPutin, pictured with the President of Ghana yesterday, has emerged as the key power-broker in Syria after American forces pulled out of the country earlier this month\n\nProvocation:

Turkish forces under the agreement struck between Putin and Erdogan yesterday\n\nThe Turkish-occupied area remained generally calm on Wednesday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nHowever, explosions hit various parts of Syria including the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli and the town of Suluk in the Tal Abyad region near Turkey's border.\n\nThe Kurds claim the attack is still going on and Syrians in Ras al-Ain suffered horrific burns in a blast yesterday, before the ceasefire ended.\n\nOnce the Kurdish fighters have withdrawn, Russian and Turkish forces will then begin joint patrols along the Turkish-controlled zone.\n\nThe two countries are also said to be in talks about extra deliveries of Russian-made S-400 missile defence systems to Ankara.\n\nTurkey halted its offensive last week under a US-brokered ceasefire and said there was 'no need' to resume military operations when the ceasefire expired on Tuesday.\n\nBut Ankara has also warned that it will take 'necessary measures' to 'neutralise' any Kurdish fighters who remain in the border area.\n\nErdogan wants a southern buffer zone against the Kurdish fighters, whom he considers terrorists.\n\nRussian presence: Members of the Russian military police patrol in the north-eastern Syrian city of Kobane today as Moscow's forces arrive to help escort Kurdish fighters out

he voiced fears that the Kurds could stay in the area by wearing Syrian army uniforms.\n\nPutin told Erdogan at their Sochi summit that he would not let that happen, the Turkish leader told reporters yesterday.\n\nMeanwhile, Bashar al-Assad's forces are returning to long-abandoned towns and villages without firing a shot after the Americans pulled out.\n\nAbandoned by U.S. forces, the Kurds had no choice but to turn to Russia and its ally Syria for help against Turkey.\n\nAnkara has previously backed anti-Assad rebels and an opposition flag was unveiled alongside a Turkish one at a former Kurdish headquarters in Syria yesterday.\n\nHowever, Turkey has decided it would rather have Assad's forces along the border than the Kurdish fighters it wants expelled.\n\nThe deal has given the Syrian leader 'de facto recognition,' said Lina Khatib of UK think-tank Chatham House.\n\n'Assad and Russia see this recognition as the beginning of international community normalization with the Assad regime, and as such an indication of their victory in the war,' she said.\n\nTurkey said there was 'no need' to resume its military onslaught when a five-day ceasefire ended on Tuesday night- but Syrians were injured by a blast in the border area\n\nA young girl is carried away with an injured leg after an explosion in the border area in Syria\n\nTrump has shown no interest in toppling Assad and pulled U.S. forces out of Syria to bring troops home from what he called 'endless wars' in the Middle East.\n\nThat opened the door to Turkey's invasion in what was widely condemned as a betrayal of the Kurdish fighters who had helped to defeat ISIS.\n\nWith American forces gone, the border zone is now a tinderbox of Turkish, Russian and Syrian forces as well as anti-Assad rebels - shattering Kurdish hopes of autonomy.\n\nDonald Trump declared yesterday hailed the deal as a 'big success' and said the Kurds were 'safe and have worked very nicely with us'.\n\nDeclaring that the ceasefire would become 'permanent', Trump said he was lifting sanctions which were imposed on Turkey after the invasion began.\n\nHowever, a a top U.S. official warned that more than 100 ISIS prisoners had escaped since Turkey's invasion began.\n\nJames Jeffrey told Congress that the State Department 'does not know where they are', amid fears of a mass jailbreak amid the chaos in the region.\n\nDetention camps in Syria are believed to be holding more than 10,000 militants, including some 2,000 foreign fighters.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Vladmir Putin meet in the resort of Sochi for a summit to discuss the future of Syria on Tuesday\n\nAngry Kurds have blocked US troops in the streets as they cross from Syria into Iraq in a display of hostility after Washington pulled the plug on their support\n\nKurdish fighters have previously warned they do not have the resources to guard the prisons but are still doing so at the moment, the special envoy said.\n\nTrump insisted soon afterwards that some of the escaped prisoners had already been recaptured.\n\nWith concerns that the Kurds may no longer be able to monitor ISIS prisoners, Trump said he expects Turkey to 'abide by its commitment' to act as a 'back-up to the Kurds.'\n\n'Should something happen, Turkey is there to grab them,' he said.\n\nThe U.S. has indicated that some of its withdrawn troops may stay in western Iraq to continue the fight against ISIS.\n\nBut Iraq appeared to throw those plans into disarray this week by saying the Americans had no permission to stay there.\n\nYesterday the Iraqi PM confirmed that position, saying Baghdad was taking 'all international legal measures'.\n\nU.S. troops leaving Syria and heading to Iraq earlier this week in a

considering keeping a small U.S. force in north-eastern Syria to protect oilfields and Trump indicated today that a few troops would remain there.\n\n'We have secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil,' the President said.\n\nThe United States currently has 5,200 troops posted in Iraq, deployed as part of a Washington-led coalition against the ISIS jihadists.\n\nThe U.S. presence at several bases across Iraq is already controversial, with numerous political groups and pro-Iran Shiite armed groups demanding their expulsion.",
