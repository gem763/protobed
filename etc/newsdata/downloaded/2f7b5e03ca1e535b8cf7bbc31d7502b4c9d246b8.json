Joe Kennedy III, but she\u2019s endorsed incumbent Sen. Ed Markey.\n\nBOSTON \u2014 When Elizabeth Warren needed a glowing introduction to her speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, her former law school student, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, was there to provide it. When she needed someone to introduce her to the teeming crowd when she launched her presidential campaign earlier this year, Kennedy once again was the choice.\n\nYet as Kennedy embarks on the biggest race of his career, a primary challenge to Sen. Ed Markey next year, Warren won\u2019t be returning the favor. In a contest that will force the Massachusetts political class to choose sides, Warren has endorsed Markey.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe awkwardness is hard to miss.\n\nIn standing by her Senate colleague, Warren is lining up with much of the state\u2019s Democratic establishment. Markey, who has served in Congress since the 1970s, has the backing of the majority of the congressional delegation and the state legislature. Few of them are anxious to see a respected incumbent taken down in a primary that largely hinges on generational themes.\n\nIn Warren\u2019s case, she announced her endorsement of Markey months ago, before Kennedy\u2019s plans became public.\n\n\"Elizabeth Warren made a commitment and she's going to keep that commitment. And when you're running for president, that's a smart thing because you want people to believe you keep your word, and in this case she is,\" said Mary Anne Marsh, a political analyst at Dewey Square Group in Boston. \"In the end, Elizabeth Warren is not gonna get involved in the U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts when she's trying to win the biggest race of her life, which is the White House.\"\n\nWith speculation about the race building to a fever pitch, Warren once again was forced to address the issue last weekend.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Joe Kennedy is also a good friend. I have worked with him since he was a student of mine. Both he and his wife were my students. I have worked with him as a congressman. I have nothing but the highest respect for him and I have no criticism,\" Warren said at the Massachusetts Democratic convention on Saturday.\n\nThe questions aren\u2019t likely to go away, as long as there\u2019s suspicion that her heart is with Kennedy in the race. While other prominent Massachusetts political figures, including former Rep. Barney Frank, have said Kennedy should avoid a challenge and save Democratic resources for defeating President Donald Trump, Warren has been more circumspect, saying only that she is not concerned by the prospect of a Senate primary.\n\n\"I'm not worried about any part of that,\" Warren told reporters on Saturday. \"You can ask this 400 different ways and you're going to get the same answer. I've endorsed Sen. Markey, I am friends with Congressman Kennedy and with Sen. Markey. That's what I have to say.\"\n\nAt least one of the senior people advising her presidential campaign will also be working for Kennedy\u2019s campaign: Tracey Lewis, the deputy campaign manager on Warren\u2019s 2012 Senate race who was one of the first hires announced by her presidential exploratory committee. The Warren campaign paid Lewis\u2019 firm, TL Strategies, $55,000 through the first two quarters of 2019.\n\nMarkey\u2019s campaign declined to comment on a top Warren campaign hand working for Kennedy\u2019s Senate run.\n\nAnd while Kennedy has stumped for her in New Hampshire, Warren brushed off the suggestion that her former law student was putting her in a tough spot by campaigning for her when she can't do the same for him. \"No,\" Warren told reporters at the state convention last weekend, flatly. She conceded that she had spoken with Kennedy, but declined to say what they talked about.\n\nAt the state party convention, where both Markey and Warren were keynote speakers, the two senators did not appear together \u2014 Attorney General Maura Healey brought Warren on stage. But Markey was careful to highlight his relationship with Warren. Before he addressed the party activists, he played an introduction video that featured clips of Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsing him.\n\nMarkey pushed back on a suggestion that Kennedy has been a more vigorous campaigner for Warren\u2019s presidential bid.\n\n\u201cI've already been up to New Hampshire for Sen. Warren. I've already campaigned for her in Michigan. So I'm a big supporter of Sen. Warren. I think she is gonna become the next president of the United States and I\u2019m honored to be her partner on the floor of the Senate,\u201d Markey said. \u201cI'm honored by the incredible things she continues to say about me and my partnership with her.\u201d\n\nYet that partnership doesn\u2019t date back as far as Warren\u2019s relationship with the Kennedy scion, which predates his time in Congress. Kennedy took at least two of Warren\u2019s classes at Harvard Law School, including advanced bankruptcy, when the financial crisis hit in 2008. He even met his future wife in one of her classes.\n\nAs Warren went to Washington in the aftermath of the crash and pushed for a consumer finance watchdog as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform package, Kennedy assisted her efforts by lobbying then-Massachusetts Rep. Bill Delahunt \u2014 for whom Kennedy once served as an intern \u2014 on the proposal.\n\n\u201cCongressman Delahunt (with Joe Kennedy\u2019s help) and Congressman [Brad] Miller were ready to go, eager to take on the fight for the agency in the House,\u201d recalls Warren in her book A Fighting Chance.\n\nMassachusetts Playbook newsletter Our must-read rundown of what\u2019s up on Beacon Hill and beyond.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nWarren\u2019s relationship with \u2014 and affection for \u2014 the Kennedy clan runs deep. Starting in the late 90\u2019s, Warren and the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, who was Joe Kennedy's great-uncle, were early allies in what Warren often calls the \u201cBankruptcy Wars.\u201d\n\nWarren on occasion is sentimental about occupying the same Senate seat that both Ted and John F. Kennedy held\n\n\u201cI sit at their desk and you know how I know that? They wrote their names in the drawer,\u201d she told a town hall in the small town of Kermit, West Virginia last spring. \u201cIt\u2019s true! Schoolteachers know, it\u2019s like every bad 4th grader. And, I\u2019ll tell you, when it gets really tough some days I sit on the floor of the Senate and I listen to some of this stuff and I open the drawer and just run my thumb across their names and I think, \u2018You stay in the fight for what you believe in.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere's been quiet speculation that Warren could flip her endorsement, but it's not clear Kennedy needs the boost. Early polling shows Kennedy with an edge in the race. The 38-year-old congressman runs 14 percentage points ahead of Markey in a head-to-head contest, and he's up 9 percentage points when tested against Markey and the other primary challengers, executive Steve Pemberton and attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, according to the Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll.\n\n\"The interesting question \u2014 and we'll never know \u2014 is what would Elizabeth Warren have done if she didn't endorse 6 or 7 months ago and waited until now?\" Marsh said. \"What if she had waited until Joe Kennedy got into the race and had to choose between the two? She may very well have had the same answer.\"\n\n", "description": "The Massachusetts senator has a history with Rep. Joe Kennedy III, but she\u2019s endorsed incumbent Sen.
