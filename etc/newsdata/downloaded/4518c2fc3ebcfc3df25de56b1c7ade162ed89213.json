Until that point, the 600 square foot structure had mainly functioned as a storage shed, but with its high ceilings and charming, rustic exterior, Brett was convinced that it could be so much more.\n\nHaving no previous renovation experience, the former ballet dancer gained the insight and confidence needed to fully refurbish the space primarily from watching YouTube tutorials. Brett started by punctuating the wood interior with lush greenery, then installed an awe-worthy kitchen island, a special skylight in the shower, and tons of tiny, hidden compartments to help reduce clutter. For furnishings, he opted for second-hand finds and big box items that could easily be upcycled to look more high-end \u2014 all while keeping costs to a minimum.\n\nCheck out the video below to tour Brett's unique barn conversion and marvel at its transformation.", "description": "How a retired ballet dancer with no renovation experience turned a run-down shed into a 600 square foot sanctuary.", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5139045.1558033965!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/housetour.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-16"}
