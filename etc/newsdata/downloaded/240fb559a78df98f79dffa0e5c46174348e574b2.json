This one is based in Spokane, Washington and wasn\u2019t put together by a news outlet but by a developer named Larry Stone who is board member of something called the Downtown Spokane Partnership. Like \u201cSeattle is Dying\u201d this video features a lot of unflattering video of homeless people who appear high or drunk in the streets. But the video claims upfront that it\u2019s purpose is not to demonize the homeless but to talk specifically about crime, i.e. drug use, theft, vandalism, etc.\n\nWhat\u2019s effective about this clip, despite the fact that\u2019s it wasn\u2019t produced by a news outlet, are the interviews with named residents and business people who describe no longer feeling safe or comfortable downtown in their own city. One young woman describes the scene on the street as \u201cscreaming and yelling, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d She adds, \u201cIt kind of scares the crap out of me\u2026I don\u2019t know what to do in regard to this.\u201d These are real people and this problem is costing them something.\n\nThe center of the clip involves a comparison between Spokane and nearby Boise, Idaho. Both cities are about the same size and have nearly identical demographics and levels of education. And yet, both property crime and violent crime are significantly higher in Spokane.\n\nThe second half of the video proposes four solutions to the problem of Spokane\u2019s crime, starting with building more jail facilities and having more police walk a beat. Both of these suggestions make sense in the context of trying to reduce crime closer to the level of Boise.\n\nThe last two recommendations involve public transportation and public parking. The justification for a plan to move the bus station underground is that the bus station is currently a hotbed for calls to the police.\n\nThe final recommendation about additional parking strikes me as having more to do with the developer\u2019s urban planning goals than directly dealing with crime. The video claims more parking will mean more people downtown and that will somehow push the crime out of the area. I\u2019m not convinced on that point. More people and cars might attract more criminals.\n\nIf you want to know more about the person behind this clip, they set up a website with and FAQ here. The Spokesman-Review has published an opinion piece criticizing the clip as inaccurate and shallow here.", "description": "\"It kind of scares the crap out of me...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Spokane-homeless.jpg"}
