That projection is nearly $7 million higher than the figure of just over $109 million for the current season.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nA drop of 10 to 15 percent would be somewhere between $11.6 million and $17.4 million off the current projection. A drop in the cap would also impact the starting figures for maximum salary contracts, which range from 25 to 30 to 35 percent of the cap. It would also impact various exceptions and the rookie scale contracts, which rise or fall by the same percentage as the cap does.\n\nThe Chinese flag is never far in the NBA's flagship retail store in Beijing.

Every team has a dedicated salary cap expert, and some have as many as two to three people involved in the process. It\u2019s not uncommon for team salary cap personnel to estimate different changes in the cap from the league\u2019s official projection in an effort to cover all possible scenarios. A 10-to-15 percent drop would be quite a change, however.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne team\u2019s cap expert told Yahoo Sports: \u201cI haven\u2019t really been in this spot before. The cap has only gone up in recent years. It\u2019s really different. I have to wonder if the league would be pressed to consider some measures to not drop the cap down so far from where we are today at $109 [million]. Otherwise, a bunch of us are over the tax. It\u2019d be nice to know now, because that changes how we approach trades and everything else throughout the season.\u201d\n\nAs it stands with today\u2019s $116 million projection, just eight teams project to have cap space in the summer of 2020. These projections range from $16.4 million to $78 million in space. A drop of even $11 million would remove several teams from being spenders this summer. In addition, a handful of teams that currently don\u2019t project to be taxpayers could find themselves unexpectedly over the luxury tax line.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The process is part of NBA teams\u2019 regular seasonal planning, but a drop in the cap would change the offseason landscape.", "authors": ["Keith Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NIqtmPbxZdspx0sL4SD2ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDMuNDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9uygWS.tZgAnLY6AHh6ZhQ--~B/aD0yMzUzO3c9MzMzNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9f6580a0-eaf4-11e9-9b76-3037b9e1397c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
