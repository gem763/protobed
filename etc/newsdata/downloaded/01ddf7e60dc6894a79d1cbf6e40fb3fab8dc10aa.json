On Wednesday and Thursday it was closed intermittently because of the heat, as temperatures went well above 36C.\n\nNevertheless, from early Friday a long line of visitors queued as busloads more cruised the car park. A cheer went up when rangers took down the \u201chigh winds\u201d sign mid-morning and allowed tourists to climb in small groups. About 200 people had begun the ascent within half an hour of the opening.\n\nWe can't climb Uluru?? But we have larrikin spirit coming out our mateholes | First Dog on the Moon Read more\n\nAn Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park ranger, 28-year-old Tjiangu Thomas, said it was \u201ceasy\u201d to wake up this morning knowing the climb was about to close for good.\n\n\u201cThis is really important for me and for Anangu and for the region. It\u2019s a strong example of Anangu making decisions for their land,\u201d Thomas said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, respect is a choice. Obviously it\u2019s disappointing [to see people wanting to climb] but compared to the school holidays this [crowd] isn\u2019t too much.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather emotional, having elders who picked up this long journey before I was born to close the climb. They\u2019re no longer here, but we\u2019re carrying their legacy to close the climb. So there\u2019s a bit of sadness there, but also happiness knowing that the climb will be closed and respect is going to be given to Anangu\u2019s wishes.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of our resources to manage the climb and it does take away from the cultural value of this place,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nAt the front of the queue a couple from Adelaide, who did not want to be named, said they would have waited the day to see if they could make the climb, which was \u201cimportant to them as Australians, because the rock is a symbol for all of us\u201d.\n\nImmediately behind them Callie Derks, her daughters, Madison and Georgia, and husband, Noel Derks, said they had done the climb three times before. This time, the family made it a short way up the rock for a \u201cphoto opportunity\u201d before they had to leave for the airport.\n\n\u201cThe views from up there are worth it,\u201d Callie Derks said. \u201cI go up respectfully and don\u2019t stray from where we\u2019re allowed to go,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Japanese tourist Hikaru Ide Nagano, who is on a working holiday in Australia, said he had come to Uluru to pay his respects by not climbing. Ide said Uluru was sacred, and to walk around the base was enough.\n\nWatching the last of the climbers, the Anangu man Vince Forrester from Mutitjulu said the discoloured and damaged rock along the climbing route was like a scar that would not go away in his lifetime. Forester said tourists using the top of the rock as a toilet had poisoned waterholes and wildlife, and he was glad the climb would soon be over.\n\nForrester also called for greater involvement of Anangu in the economic opportunities that tourism in the park generates.\n\nThe climb closes for good after 4pm local time.", "description": "Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park ranger Tjiangu Thomas says closing the climb is a \u2018strong example of Anangu making decisions for their land\u2019", "authors": ["Lorena Allam", "Mike Bowers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c1bb2e66199b5794879c84fd7eacbebd30d2f3/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06979806a9dc5e63ffa6d7577b04ab94", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
