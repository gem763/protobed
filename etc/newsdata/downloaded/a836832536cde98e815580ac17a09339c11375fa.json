It's just plain rude that nobody told me. Just... why wouldn't you tell me this is what you have to see? I just wouldn't leave the house'.\n\nShocked: TikTok user Ruby Blackman's clip about realizing that people see the 'flipped' version of her face - unlike what she sees, above - went viral as it seemed to shock others too\n\nIn the short 18-second video, Ruby flips her face to illustrate her point.\n\nWhen others got word of this as the video spread to Twitter and Instagram, they seemed equally as shocked.\n\n'Here I am thinking I\u2019m gorgeous and people are seeing the flipped version of my face irl,' questioned one person.\n\nSomeone joked that they've had 'severe self esteem issues' since they found this out for themselves.\n\n'Same. My nose is crooked the way people see me while completely straight [in the] mirror,' echoed one person.\n\n'Sis same I look like I'm having a stroke,' said another.\n\n'It\u2019s funny that a lot of people didn\u2019t know about this. When you look in a mirror it\u2019s a reflection! Not a point of view. Take a picture and flip it and that\u2019s how you truly look,' an Instagram user pointed out when the video made its way to a popular meme page.\n\nFlip side: To prove her point, Ruby flipped her reflection half way through the video from what she sees, left, to the opposite view, right, and joked to viewers, 'Why wouldn't you tell me?'\n\nDifference: The only major difference when Ruby changed between her mirror reflection, left, to the 'flipped' version, right, seemed to be that her hair was tucked behind the opposite ear\n\nOn TikTok, where Ruby runs a popular account, the video has been watched 185,000 times.\n\nAnd on Twitter, the video racked up over 76,000 likes when shared by another British teen.\n\nAmong the thousands of comments, internet users are tagging their friends asking them, 'Why didn't you tell me this?'\n\nMany people pointed out that the difference the viewer sees in Ruby is so minuscule.\n\n'I also feel this but notice how when she flips it she doesn't look any different to us. We only notice on ourselves... I still stress about it though,' one person said.\n\n'Yea you feel it more when it\u2019s you. But to others it looks normal. Weird,' added another.\n\nReactions: Thousands of teens weighed in with their own thoughts about Ruby's revelation that others see your face as the iPhone camera does\n\nPhotographer Kim Ayres explained in The Observer that '90 per cent of people will say they hate having their photo taken' because they are 'used to seeing their face' as it appears in the mirror.\n\nHe wrote: 'We have spent our lives seeing our faces in the mirror, and we have become used to seeing our face that way round. So when we reverse that image, it doesn\u2019t look right.'\n\nStar: Ruby, pictured, has amassed 67,000 followers on TikTok thanks to her makeup tutorial videos\n\nKim continued: 'No one has a perfectly symmetrical face. Most people part their hair on one side rather than the other. Most people have one eye slightly larger than the other. Most people have one curvier eyebrow and one straighter or pointier.\n\n'Most people smile slightly more out of one side of their mouth than the other. Most people have a mole, scar or facial feature on one side and not the other. And so it goes on.'\n\n'So if your nose goes two millimeters to the left, then when your image is the other way round it appears to be four millimeters to the right of where you\u2019re expecting it to be,' he continued.\n\n'When you add all these things together, when you see your face in reverse to how you expect it to be, it\u2019s you, but not you.\n\n'And that makes you feel uncomfortable; because most of us are more far more comfortable with what\u2019s familiar,' he concludes.\n\nThe fact that most people 'aren't comfortable' with the reflection of the 'flipped image' seemed apparent in the responses to Ruby's video.\n\n'This is why I hate my life,' deadpanned one female social media user.\n\n'Literally where all my insecurities come from,' said another.\n\n'I ain\u2019t ever going outside again,' added another user.", "description": "TikTok user Ruby Blackman's clip explaining how people see the flipped version of your face, right, has gone viral as everyone seems shocked by the revelation.
