A prime minister who has lost every single vote he has faced in the Commons and has thrown away his own majority by expelling a score of his most experienced and respected MPs. A government defeated on the central plank of its policy platform and ordered by MPs to do something \u2013 extend Brexit negotiations \u2013 which the prime minister has explicitly stated he will not countenance. A bewildered phalanx of Conservative MPs bullied by an unelected adviser who is unable to confirm whether he is even a member of the party himself.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this would mean just one thing: the collapse of the government and a swift election in which the hapless PM would be roundly defeated and the opposition would sweep into power. Instead, we see the Tories desperately seeking a way to be removed from office so they can capitalise on polls suggesting Boris Johnson could restore his majority by going to the country, while Labour withholds its support for the election it has spent the past two years demanding.\n\nMany in Westminster put the blame for this topsy-turvy politics on one man \u2013 David Cameron \u2013 and the unintended consequences of his tinkering with the UK\u2019s constitutional arrangements.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

By doing so, he foisted on MPs an unignorable instruction from the British people to push through a radical change, which most of the elected representatives in Westminster believe will be damaging to the national interest, without any sort of plan of how to achieve it.\n\nThis destroyed the premiership of his successor, Theresa May, who voted Remain and never seemed enthusiastic about the prospect of life after Brexit. More surprisingly, it seems possible it could fatally undermine Johnson, Brexit\u2019s biggest cheerleader.\n\nSecond, Cameron concocted legislation for fixed-term parliaments with the single aim of holding together a coalition government which, at the time, seemed a perilous innovation in need of artificial support, but now, in retrospect, looks like a beacon of stability. By depriving his successors of the ability to go to the country at a time of their own choosing \u2013 even when they have lost the confidence of the house and are unable to pass the most basic features of their programmes \u2013 he introduced an element of chaos to the UK\u2019s constitution, of which the full consequences are still difficult to predict.\n\nWhen we finally get an election (which we will) and a new government in place, it seems likely that one of its most urgent tasks will be to unravel this mess and try to find a more rational way of running the country\u2019s politics.\n\nYours,\n\nAndrew Woodcock\n\nPolitical editor", "description": "Britain is in the throes of a political crisis of a kind that has never been seen before.
