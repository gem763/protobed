Dr Cooper added: \u201cInterestingly, we see no improvement. Even recent collections are biased.\u201d\n\nThe results of this landmark dead-animal-counting exercise are published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\nHere is the abstract:\n\nNatural history specimens are widely used across ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation. Although biological sex may influence all of these areas, it is often overlooked in large-scale studies using museum specimens. If collections are biased towards one sex, studies may not be representative of the species. Here, we investigate sex ratios in over two million bird and mammal specimen records from five large international museums. We found a slight bias towards males in birds (40% females) and mammals (48% females), but this varied among orders. The proportion of female specimens has not significantly changed in 130 years, but has decreased in species with showy male traits like colourful plumage and horns. Body size had little effect. Male bias was strongest in name-bearing types; only 27% of bird and 39% of mammal types were female. These results imply that previous studies may be impacted by undetected male bias, and vigilance is required when using specimen data, collecting new specimens and designating types.\n\nAlthough the study has generated much excitement among feminist activists outraged by sexist bias, none of them appears to notice the upside of this very important exercise in dead-stuffed-animal counting:\n\nIf the majority of dead animals in Natural History Museums are male, that means fewer females were killed by collectors.
