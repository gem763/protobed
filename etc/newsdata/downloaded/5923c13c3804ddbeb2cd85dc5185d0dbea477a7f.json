Asked what he would tell perspective coaches interested in joining the Redskins, the 49ers coach and former Washington coordinator said they needed to \u201cjust look into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee what the situation is and who you want to work for,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nThe 39-year-old didn\u2019t exactly give a ringing endorsement of the Redskins\u2019 front office, who will look to hire a new head coach following the season after the team fired Jay Gruden last week.\n\nThough it\u2019s too early to list possible front-runners, the Redskins have been linked to a number of rumored candidates \u2014 from the established (Mike Tomlin) to the unproven (Kevin O\u2019Connell).\n\nHere\u2019s a look at who has been rumored so far, and what each could bring to the Redskins:\n\n\u2981 Mike Tomlin, Steelers coach: Tomlin would easily be the biggest splash the Redskins could make. CBS Sports reported owner Dan Snyder is infatuated with the Steelers\u2019 coach and is prepared to give him \u201cfull authority.\u201d ESPN, however, called the possibility \u201cfar-fetched.\u201d\n\nOne problem: The Steelers don\u2019t seem interested in firing Tomlin, which means the Redskins would likely have to give up draft picks to get him. That seems like a terrible idea for a franchise with a 1-5 record.\n\nStill, Tomlin\u2019s teams always seem well-prepared. He\u2019s been a calming influence over dysfunctional situations \u2014 from Antonio Brown\u2019s antics to Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s contract situation. Team president Bruce Allen knows Tomlin from their time in Tampa together.\n\n\u2981 Kevin O\u2019Connell, Redskins offensive coordinator: With all due respect to interim coach Bill Callahan, if there\u2019s an internal candidate on the Redskins\u2019 coaching staff, it appears to be O\u2019Connell. Washington once employed Shanahan, Sean McVay and Matt LaFleur \u2014 three of the league\u2019s premier offensive minds \u2014 and could want to avoid letting another young mind walk out of the building.\n\nAt 34, O\u2019Connell is regarded in the same vein. With Gruden gone, he\u2019s now calling the plays, too. \u201cI think he did a great job of play-calling and put us in some great positions,\u201d running back Adrian Peterson said in Miami.\n\nThe remaining 10 games will be important for O\u2019Connell to further establish his candidacy.\n\n\u2981 Todd Bowles, Buccaneers defensive coordinator: The Redskins pursued Bowles, the former head coach of the New York Jets, this offseason to join their defensive staff. Instead, the 55-year-old went to Tampa, where he has helped transform the Buccaneers into one of the league\u2019s top defenses.\n\nBowles wouldn\u2019t be the most inspiring choice to be the Redskins\u2019 next coach, but he has experience \u2014 and connections to the franchise. In New York, Bowles went 10-6 his first year but went 14-34 over the next three before he was fired in January.\n\nAs a player, Bowles spent even of his eight seasons with the Redskins. Bowles has been praised as being even-keeled.\n\n\u2981 Byron Leftwich, Buccaneers offensive coordinator: If the Redskins want to go with another offensive play-caller, how about Leftwich? A former quarterback, Leftwich is now the coordinator in Tampa. He\u2019s worked closely with quarterback Jameis Winston, who was off to a strong start before his six-turnover meltdown Sunday in London.\n\nThe Redskins could go with an offensive-minded head coach because they have to develop rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins. Ironically, it was former Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan who described Haskins as \u201cLeftwich to a T\u201d in his pre-draft evaluation of the Ohio State product.\n\nHis name will be floated for coaching positions, even if it\u2019s not for the Redskins.\n\n\u2981 Eric Bieniemy, Chiefs offensive coordinator: Bieniemy does not call plays in Kansas City, but he\u2019s still seen as an innovator on offense. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes told The Undefeated Bieniemy \u201cholds me accountable\u201d and praised him for explaining the game well.\n\nBefore being promoted to offensive coordinator in 2018, Bieniemy was a long-time running backs coach \u2014 even coaching Peterson in Minnesota. He is expected to be heavily pursued this offseason and has been interviewed for head coaching roles before.\n\nBieniemy, 50, has been described as incredibly detailed-oriented. It would be easy to imagine the Redskins being interested in that as a frequent criticism related to Gruden was that he didn\u2019t pay enough attention to the details.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
