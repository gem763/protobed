(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n\u25cfImpeachment inquiry puts new focus on Giuliani\u2019s work for prominent figures in Ukraine\n\nRead the whistleblower complaint | The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky | Related coverage and analysis of the Trump impeachment inquiry\n\n8:15 a.m.: Former staff members say it\u2019s unusual for a secretary of state to listen in on a call with leader of small nation\n\nFormer staff members who worked on foreign leader calls said it is very unusual for a secretary of state to listen in on calls with leaders from a country as small as Ukraine.\n\nPartly it is because the secretary of state\u2019s schedule is very busy and rarely aligns with the president\u2019s schedule of routine calls to heads of state, so they arrange only to be on major foreign leader conversations.\n\nFormer secretary of state Rex Tillerson, for example, would coordinate plans to listen in on Trump\u2019s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nThe former staffers on the National Security Council said Pompeo\u2019s presence on this call suggests the subject or the purpose of the call had high importance to the president, and thus to him. The former staffers spoke on condition of anonymity to speak more candidly.\n\n\u2014 Carol D. Leonnig\n\n7:15 a.m.: Pompeo confirms he was on Trump\u2019s July call with Zelensky\n\nPompeo acknowledged publicly for the first time Wednesday that he was on the July call between Trump and the leader of Ukraine.\n\nAsked about the episode during a news conference in Rome, Pompeo said, \u201cI was on the phone call.\u201d\n\nIn response to a multi-part question, he did not say whether he was comfortable with Trump\u2019s pressing of Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nPompeo said the call focused on issues such as the threat that Russia poses to Ukraine and the need for Ukraine to root out corruption.\n\nHe said the United States would consider to pursue those issues \u201ceven while all this noise is going on.\u201d\n\nPompeo also repeated his claims from a letter on Tuesday that House Democratic staffers have been seeking to intimidate State Department officials in their efforts to learn more about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying, intimidating State Department employees. That\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Country to hear directly from Trump, Pelosi on Wednesday\n\nThe country will hear directly from the two leading figures in the impeachment drama \u2014 Trump and Pelosi \u2014 at separately scheduled news conferences on Wednesday.\n\nPelosi plans to hold a news conference on Capitol Hill at 10:45 a.m. She will be accompanied by Schiff, who has become the public face for Democrats in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has a 2 p.m. joint press conference scheduled with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, who is visiting the White House on Wednesday. Trump is certain to get questions from U.S. journalists about the impeachment drive.\n\n6:15 a.m.: Critics blast Trump for calling his impeachment inquiry a \u2018COUP\u2019\n\nTrump claimed he was a victim of a coup d\u2019etat on Tuesday night, continuing his dramatic rhetoric that has drawn fierce pushback from legal scholars and Democrats since the House impeachment inquiry began last week.\n\n\u201cAs I learn more and more each day,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of the United States of America!\u201d\n\nCritics disputed the president\u2019s tweet by pointing to basic definitions of a coup d\u2019etat, a violent illegal overthrow of the government by an opposing group, and impeachment, a legal process laid out in the Constitution. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful, even suggested Trump should not be allowed to make such a remark on Twitter, sharing his \u201cCOUP\u201d tweet with CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Meagan Flynn\n\n6 a.m.: Giuliani suggests suing Democrats over Ukraine probe\n\nOn Tuesday night, Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed an unusual legal strategy in response to the ongoing investigation into President Trump\u2019s dealings in Ukraine: Suing Democratic members of Congress.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News show \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d Trump\u2019s personal attorney said that he \u201chad a couple of talks\u201d with attorneys amid the accelerating impeachment probe and a House subpoena for his own personal records concerning Ukraine. Their recommendation, Giuliani said, was \u201cthat we should bring a lawsuit on behalf of the president and several people in the administration, maybe even myself as a lawyer, against the members of Congress individually for violating constitutional rights, violating civil rights.\u201d\n\nHost Laura Ingraham noted that Giuliani\u2019s suggestion was \u201cnovel,\u201d and that congressional immunity prevents House members from being sued for anything they say on the floor. But outside those parameters, Giuliani argued, they could be held liable for forming a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to deprive the president of his constitutional rights.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Antonia Noori Farzan", "description": "The secretary of state\u2019s acknowledgment came at the outset of what is shaping up as another busy day in the drive for impeachment by House Democrats.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/F2fwqsFpbltRdr-Tebuj36i02vM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ADT56AXDW4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
