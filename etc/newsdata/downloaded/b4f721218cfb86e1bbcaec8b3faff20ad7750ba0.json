The lender stressed that food subsidies should be targeted towards the less well off.", "description": "Egypt said on Tuesday it had returned nearly 2 million people to its food subsidy program since February, two days after tweets by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in which he said he was personally following the politically-sensitive matter.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
