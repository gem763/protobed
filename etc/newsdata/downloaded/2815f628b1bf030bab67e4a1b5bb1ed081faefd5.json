The first set of aircraft were delivered this year and were showcased on Tuesday in front of South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nMoon and other officials inspected the new assets at a ceremony in the city of Daegu, which include an \u201cF-35A, reconnaissance drone, Hyunmoo II ballistic and Hyunmoo III cruise missiles, as well as PAC-III and M-SAM missile defense systems and K-9 self-propelled artillery.\u201d\n\nIn a televised speech, Moon admitted it was the first time he felt \u201csecure about the might of our military armed with new equipment such as F-35As,\u201d adding that South Koreans should feel \u201cvery proud\u201d of their country\u2019s rising military strength.\n\nAs noted by Yonhap News Agency, Daegu was \u201cone of the last defense lines for South Korea\u201d and its \u201cvictories in fierce battles there helped turn the tide of the war triggered by the North\u2019s surprise attack.\u201d As a result, the city has become a \u201ctraditional stronghold of the nation\u2019s conservative bloc, especially the main opposition Liberty Korea Party,\u201d and is often referred to as a \u201csacred place\u201d for South Korean conservatism.\n\nDespite his low popularity due to his left-wing views and support for appeasement of North Korea, Moon commended Daegu\u2019s citizens, pointing out that they had to suffer the inconveniences of holding the country\u2019s military facilities. \u201cWhen the country is in trouble, Daegu citizens have always shown amazing patriotism,\u201d he said.\n\nThe show of strength is likely to infuriate the communist regime in Pyongyang, which has previously described such activity as a \u201cgrave provocation\u201d and a threat to a future long-term peace treaty between the two nations. Moon dismissed concerns to this effect and argued it would make an agreement easier.\n\n\u201cPeace is something to make, not to keep,\u201d Moon said. \u201cOur military\u2019s airtight security (measures) support dialogue and cooperation and enable (us) to take an audacious walk toward permanent peace.\u201d\n\nAttempts at achieving a comprehensive peace agreement between the United States and North and South Korea have stalled in recent months, with a planned summit between North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February cut short due to disputes over continued sanctions against the regime. The two men held a brief meeting at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in late June where they agreed to resume negotiations.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "South Korea on Tuesday showed off some of its new U.S.-made F-35 stealth fighter jets for the first time on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/F-35-south-korea-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
