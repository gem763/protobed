Think again", "language": "en", "text": "Let\u2019s face it \u2026 health insurance can be expensive. When you\u2019re working to stretch your dollar as a young, healthy adult, you may let health insurance be the first thing to go.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nYes, we\u2019ve all heard, \u201caccidents happen\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s too risky to go without insurance.\u201d But what many people seem to forget (or may not know) is the future financial impact of NOT having health insurance at a young age.\n\nAccording to a study by the American Public Health Association, 66.5% of all bankruptcies are tied to medical issues \u2014 either because of high costs for health care or time out of work. If you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck, those unexpected accidents and issues are detrimental to your future self.\n\nSo even if you are young and healthy, you can say goodbye to early retirement, or even retirement in general, if you do not prepare for the worst.\n\nSo even if you are young and healthy, you can say goodbye to early retirement, or even retirement in general, if you do not prepare for the worst.\n\nThe good news is that there are viable health insurance options out there, especially for the young and healthy. For example, if you don\u2019t go to the doctor as often, and can cover unexpected illnesses, then a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) may be a great fit.\n\nThe premiums with an HDHP are generally lower versus those of traditional PPO plans, plus you and your employer can contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA) to build your savings tax free. With an HDHP you essentially \u201cpay as you go\u201d and have more money to use for your retirement and medical needs.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about retirement for a minute. While hard to imagine now, in 20 years the millennial generation will be facing retirement. In 2050, imagine you have $100,000 in your savings, 401(k), money markets, and checking accounts. With this amount of money, retirement may seem like a breeze.\n\nBut unfortunately, recent reports show that you need to almost triple that amount to cover health-care costs alone in retirement. Mind you, this doesn\u2019t take into account the rising health-care costs year over year.\n\nLet\u2019s also consider taxes. Even though you may have $100,000 in savings, that doesn\u2019t mean you get to keep all of it. You will likely have to pay Uncle Sam on withdrawals from your 401(k), savings, or traditional IRA.\n\nSimple math\n\nWith an HSA, your money builds interest tax free. Plus, you can contribute to and distribute from your HSA tax free, leaving more in your pocket for medical expenses now and in retirement.\n\nIf you choose an HSA-eligible plan such as an HDHP, you should make the most of it, maintaining enough funds in your HSA cash account to cover out-of-pocket expenses and your deductible. This ensures your money is working for you, and unexpected medical bills will not disrupt your retirement plans.\n\nIt may all sound confusing, but it\u2019s actually pretty simple once you do the math. While retirement may feel far off, the decisions you make today will have an impact on your future. One unexpected medical expense when you are uninsured can be detrimental to your savings and have long-term repercussions on your financial future.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nEven if you\u2019re young and healthy, it\u2019s crucial to take advantage of the health insurance plan options available to you in order to best protect yourself now and in retirement.\n\nChad Wilkins serves as an Executive Vice President of Webster Bank and President of HSA Bank where he is responsible for leading the organization and its people toward sustainable growth well into the future.
