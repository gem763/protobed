Ted Cruz remarked on Twitter, \u201cGun control doesn\u2019t work. Look at Chicago.\u201d And that was all it took for the left-leaning mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, to go off the deep end.\n\nLiberals hate truths.\n\nBut my, do they love throwing hissy fits.\n\nThis is what Cruz tweeted, in response to Chicago\u2019s bloody homicide rate: \u201cGun control doesn\u2019t work. Look at Chicago. Disarming law-abiding citizens isn\u2019t the answer. Stopping violent criminals \u2014 prosecuting and getting them off the street \u2014 BEFORE they commit more violent crimes is the most effective way to reduce murder rates. Let\u2019s protect our citizens.\u201d\n\nYes. Let\u2019s.\n\nLightfoot, however, had other ideas in mind \u2014 like shutting up Cruz and all his sensible, fact-based statements. Before he started making sense to the Democrat Party\u2019s main funders \u2014 or worse, to any on-the-fence and fed-up voters.\n\nShe tweeted back: \u201c60% of illegal firearms recovered in Chicago come from outside IL \u2014 mostly from states dominated by coward Republicans like you who refuse to enact commonsense gun legislation. Keep our name out of your mouth.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right; Cruz can no longer say \u201cChicago\u201d \u2014 else face the wrath of Lightfoot.\n\nBut let\u2019s skip over the feigned outrage and hysterics, shall we?\n\nThe fact that Lightfoot finds most illegal gun confiscations involve weapons that are purchased out of state isn\u2019t really a pertinent argument to shutter gun sales in other states. Rather, it\u2019s an underscore of the criminal minds\u2019 abilities to sidestep law \u2014 of which, on guns, there are many in Chicago.\n\n\u201cGun-related murders are carried out by a predictable pool of people,\u201d Heritage Foundation reported in 2018. \u201cHigher rates of gun ownership are not associated with higher rates of violent crime. There is no clear relationship between strict gun control legislation and homicide or violent crime rates.\u201d\n\nThose are three fact-based, researched-based, fact-tested tried-and-trues on gun control.\n\nOr, as Heritage put it: \u201cEach of these facts is firmly based on empirical data.\u201d\n\nLeftists like Lightfoot, though, don\u2019t like these facts \u2014 don\u2019t like to use facts at all \u2014 because they get in the way of their visions of gun control, which gets in the way of their visions for government control.\n\nFacts may be, well, factual. But for the gun-control-at-all-costs types in the Democrat Party, emotional, angry outbursts and pot-shots are always orders of the day.\n\nLightfoot no doubt learned long ago that in her party, the way to win funding, low information votes and the necessary level of backing to win political elections is to throw a fit, so as to distract from fact. On that, like many in her party, she\u2019s become expert.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t fix Chicago\u2019s crime problem. But there\u2019s that nasty f-word, fact, rearing its head again.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
