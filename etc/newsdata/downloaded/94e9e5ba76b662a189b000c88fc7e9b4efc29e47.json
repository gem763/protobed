Drexel University discovered the alleged fraud in 2017 during an internal audit and alerted the government.\n\nMost of the money was spent on strip clubs and sports bars in the Philadelphia area, according to a news release.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of flagrant and audacious fraud, and a shameful misuse of public funds.\u201d said U.S. Attorney William McSwain. \u201cThe agencies providing these grant funds expect them to be used towards advancements in energy and naval technology for public benefit, not for personal entertainment.\u201d\n\nMcSwain lauded Drexel for reporting the matter but expressed disappointment that Nwankpa\u2019s conduct \u201cwent unnoticed for so long.\u201d\n\nDrexel has agreed to pay $189,000 to resolve its potential civil liability in the case. The university said in a statement that it takes \u201callegations of unethical or unlawful business conduct \u2026 very seriously,\u201d adding that it has improved its auditing controls.\n\nNwankpa repaid more than $53,000, resigned from Drexel and was barred from federal contracting for six months, prosecutors said. He has not been charged with a crime.\n\nA message seeking comment was left at a number for Nwankpa, who worked at Drexel for 27 years until his 2017 resignation. An online profile for Nwankpa said he is self-employed as an engineering consultant.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A former university professor in Philadelphia spent federal grant money on strip clubs and other personal expenses, prosecutors said Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/University_Professor-Misspent_Grants_42333.jpg-d06a4_c0-174-4161-2600_s1770x1032.jpg?d90b5eabee1015eda74675915c49038ffe1d6df1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
