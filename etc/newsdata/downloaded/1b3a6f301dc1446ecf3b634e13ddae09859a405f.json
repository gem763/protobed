No one expected an experiment to determine the fate of humanity\u2019s collective afterlife would be easy, but did it really have to involve Brent?\n\nThe Good Place is back, benches, and the final season started off in top form. \u201cA Girl From Arizona Part 1\" returns us to the latest incarnation of the Good Place, only this time it\u2019s a massive psychological experiment instead of a froyo-filled torture chamber.\n\nEleanor (Kristen Bell), Michael (Ted Danson) and almost the rest of the Soul Squad (sad face) have been given a year to prove that the Good Place needs to update its scoring system and give humanity a second chance at eternal bliss.\n\nHere's Your Crash Course In The Good Place Before The Fourth And Final Season Begins Listen up, ya dinks! The Good Place is about to begin its final season. It\u2019s a bittersweet situation: The best comedy on TV will be no more, but it also means the show will be ending exactly as its creators intended. Ahead of this week\u2019s season four premiere, here\u2019s your catch-up crash course in all things Good. Read more\n\nThe only problem is that their four human subjects are just the worst, handpicked by the Bad Place to make their lives miserable (with one demonic exception that we\u2019ll get to).\n\nWe\u2019re already familiar with gossip columnist John Wheaton and Chidi\u2019s ex-girlfriend Simone \u2014 who I was worried was going to be predictable, since we already know her, but they forking showed me. Instead of accepting the premise put before her, Simone thinks she\u2019s suffered a traumatic brain injury and is in a coma, so she goes around wearing cheese hats and throwing strangers in pools.\n\nIt\u2019s a surprising development that not only made sense for her character but also provided some great material: \u201cThis is all in my head. I\u2019m going to go eat a knife!\u201d\n\nThen you have your two new arrivals. There\u2019s Brent Norwalk, a polo-clad dinglehopper of white male privilege who doesn\u2019t understand why the PC Police can\u2019t take a joke anymore; also he\u2019s the least-racist person in the world and really wants to make sure you know that.\n\nAnd finally, we have Linda, an older woman who\u2019s just, like, not that into it? At least that\u2019s what we\u2019re led to think... until she punches Eleanor in the face. Turns out, Linda was actually Chris Baker, Eleanor\u2019s former fake soulmate who kept making excuses to go to the gym.\n\nThe Bad Place tried to pull a fast one on the team but got caught, so now the Judge had decided Chidi will be the fourth human in the experiment. And Eleanor is not happy about it.\n\nEleanor is rocking the fork out of that dress.\n\nOne of the best things about The Good Place is how well it moves between the silly and the sincere. Amidst all the hilarious jokes and clever restaurant signs (my favourite this week was Ponzu Scheme) is a heartbreaking story about Eleanor struggling with her pain over losing Chidi, who had his memory erased so he wouldn\u2019t expose the experiment with his Zone of Truth spell.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to put on a brave face, but there are signs that Eleanor is not keeping it together \u2014 even to the detriment of the experiment. For example, she refused to introduce Chidi and Simone because she \u201cdidn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary\u201d. Plus, it was actually Tahani who spotted Linda\u2019s lies, and not her.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s hard to tell whether Eleanor is sad that she doesn\u2019t have Chidi anymore or angry that she\u2019s suffering a burden he doesn\u2019t know about or have to bear. To be honest, it\u2019s probably both.\n\nI completely understand how Eleanor is feeling, and I think her actions make sense. After all, she\u2019s only human, and any of us would do the same thing in her situation. But that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be consequences for it.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot riding on this experiment and it\u2019s clear that Eleanor is already making some mistakes to protect herself from her own pain. I have a feeling that\u2019s going to come and bite them all in the butt \u2014 and by that I mean your mum\u2019s butt. Sorry, the Bad Place is getting to me.\n\n\u201cOf course your hugs are amazing.\u201d\n\nRandom Musings", "description": "The Good Place is back with its fourth and final season, and it doesn\u2019t take long for the Soul Squad to realise that saving the world is going to be one hell of a task \u2014 especially with the goobers the Bad Place is sending their way.
