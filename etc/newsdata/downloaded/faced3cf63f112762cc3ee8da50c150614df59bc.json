Long on aspirations \u2014 and short on details of how to pay for them \u2014 the debates so far are a contest of who could out-promise whom.\n\nAll the high-profile proposals, especially Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, would be expensive. But none of them would have the social costs \u2014 for generations \u2014 of forgiving all student loan debt.\n\nThat notion, so famously championed by Sen.

Some influential voices on the Right have advocated for forgiveness as well. For example, Claremont Institute\u2019s Matthew Peterson recently suggested that President Donald Trump \u201cneeds to propose a one time student loan forgiveness program in exchange for shutting down [the] entire federal educational loan program.\u201d\n\nHow would we pay for such a giveaway? It\u2019s as simple as assessing a new sales tax, as another conservative scholar proposes.\n\nBut these \u201cconservative\u201d proposals are as much fantasyland thinking as the rhetoric from the Democratic candidates.\n\nThe fool\u2019s errand of proposing a new tax aside, forgiving student loans would be political suicide for conservative policymakers. That is especially true for President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' US moves British ISIS suspects from Syria amid Turkish invasion MORE. The reason? A disproportionate share of student debt is held by those with advanced degrees (48 percent of all debt) and the highest incomes \u2014 more than a third of all student debt is held by borrowers who earn $97,000 or more. The president\u2019s base supporters, in particular, would see forgiveness for what it is: a giant giveaway for elites, so many of whom have weaponized their activism majors and identity-group degrees to undermine America.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to envision the furor that would ensue among those earnest souls who\u2019ve diligently paid off their debts, which most borrowers continue to do, in spite of upward trends in default rates. Policymakers ought to remember that only 17 percent of American adults hold student debt.\n\nAsking the right question\n\nThis whole debate has suffered from asking the wrong question. The question isn\u2019t how much student loan debt we can forgive; it\u2019s how we got here in the first place.\n\nThe answer is clear: Government. Since the expansion of student loan programs beyond their original intent of creating access for low-income students, government has done what government always does: built a near-monopoly for itself, effectively eliminating private lending. The result has been skyrocketing tuition rates, fueled by administrative bloat and obnoxious construction projects. Twenty-first century higher education spending has little to do with the instruction of students.\n\nSolving this problem, like any government-induced mess, will take time and determination. As John Cogan reminds us in his magnificent The High Cost of Good Intentions, \u201cthe creation of entitlements brings forth relentless forces that cause them to inexorably expand.\u201d\n\nExemplifying the Problem\n\nRelentless have been the negative consequences of the federal government\u2019s over-involvement in student loans. Consider, for example, the abysmal track record of the college that hosted the most recent Democratic debate, Texas Southern University in Houston. As the Department of Education\u2019s College Scorecard data shows, for a tuition of $20,000 per year, only 20 percent of students will graduate within six years, accruing an average student loan indebtedness of almost $30,000. And only 27 percent of the school\u2019s student borrowers pay at least one dollar of their student loans within three years of leaving school \u2014 one of the worst records in the country.\n\nTexas Southern is not alone, unfortunately, in serving as an example of the absurdity of the system. Consider Thomas Cooley Law School in Michigan, where students have paid tuition that is equivalent to that of the most competitive law schools in the country. The return on investment is abysmal, with only 25 percent of its graduates working in the legal field one year after graduation \u2014 and 50 percent unemployed altogether. But our current student loan system so imperfectly aligns investment with outcomes that the federal government does not distinguish loan risk between Cooley Law and law schools with far better employment records.\n\nIt gets worse. The case of the Charlotte School of Law is particularly egregious, causing the U.S. Department of Education to deploy an under-utilized step \u2014 delisting the school from approved recipients of student loans. That was fatal for the college, which received 90 percent of its revenue from federal student loan programs; students have since sued the now-closed school for fraud.\n\nThe Department of Education needs to take stronger action against colleges perpetrating educational fraud. That step, in turn, should be followed by further bold action \u2014 the decoupling of federal student loans with colleges and academic programs with poor outcomes. Too many Americans \u2014 in our contemporary, irrational belief that everyone must earn a four-year degree \u2014 have been duped into believing that every college in America is worth the investment. The federal student loan system has guaranteed that the opposite is true.\n\nThese alternatives to loan forgiveness, along with an expanded program of income contingent repayment, are possible right now, administratively, without congressional action. Longer-term solutions involving congressional action should include the ability to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy, and requiring universities \u2014 many with obscene and under-used endowments \u2014 to share the burden of their graduates\u2019 loans whenever they default. Ultimately, Congress ought to get the government out of the business of lending altogether, leaving the federal government to do what government often does well: accruing data on outcomes and trends, making them transparent and easily available to the consumer, thereby allowing the students and the market to make higher education great again.\n\nPresident Trump would be especially effective in this message, because at its core, it\u2019s a critique of the elite of elites \u2014 college administrations and liberal academics. This would be a Trumpian message at its finest, placing the onus on the tiny group of university bureaucrats who have weaponized the federal student loan system against students themselves, whether financially or in promoting the vacuous programs and identity politics that undermine the very ideals of America.\n\nWe can seize the moral high ground from the panderers on the Left on this issue.\n\nDr. Kevin Roberts is executive director of the Texas Public Policy Foundation and former president of Wyoming Catholic College, which he led through its decision to reject federal student loans and grants.", "description": "Relentless have been the negative consequences of the federal government\u2019s over-involvement in student loans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/yaleuniversity_michaelmarsland.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
