The striker, who says he has been racially abused six or seven times throughout a career that has taken him from Concord Rangers in the Isthmian Division One North to Charlton Athletic in the Championship, is disillusioned and exasperated at football\u2019s failure to truly tackle the discrimination that continues to pollute the game. Hearing Taylor question whether anything has changed since Raheem Sterling was abused by a Chelsea fan in December and recount the racial slurs he has suffered, from being called \u201ca coon\u201d while playing for Falkirk to being sent banana and monkey emojis on social media, makes difficult but necessary listening.\n\nHaringey is the perfect place for football to take a stand against racism | Helen Parton Read more\n\nThe first half of this interview revolves around the reasons the 29-year-old has dyed his hair neon pink, raising more than \u00a330,000 for Cancer Research UK, but Taylor speaks so candidly and passionately about racism, it is impossible to ignore. Taylor is searingly honest as he reflects on the depressing predictability with which the issue of racial abuse has punctuated and marred matches over the past fortnight, leading to an England game twice being halted in Bulgaria, a fan being ejected from Old Trafford, Haringey Borough walking off the pitch and Bristol City, Hearts and Northampton prompting investigations into alleged racism at their games.\n\n\u201cI feel that nothing is actually being done,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like this stuff happens, we talk about it for five minutes and then the next thing you know it\u2019s kind of brushed under the carpet. Then it happens again a week later and then we talk about it again. And then they come up with some stupid hashtag that goes out on social media, whereby \u2018this is going to change the world\u2019 but we\u2019re not going to change the world with a stupid hashtag, I\u2019m sorry. They have to now start going: \u2018Do you know what, we\u2019re not accepting this.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe live in a world where there are a billion different skin colours and religions and all of these things, and yet we have still got racism. It\u2019s all well and good as England standing there going: \u2018We\u2019re up on our high horse, the Bulgarians are disgusting, they can\u2019t do that, they can\u2019t make monkey noises\u2019 but it\u2019s happening in this country. It\u2019s not like this country is completely devoid of racism. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s happening in all leagues and at all levels in this country. So let\u2019s not get into a debate about what needs to happen in Europe and this part of the world or that part of the world. We have to clean our own house.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the idiot who was manager of the Bulgaria national team saying \u2018I didn\u2019t hear it.\u2019 Bollocks, you did hear it. Everyone heard it. You could hear it on the TV. You\u2019ve then got the [Bulgarian] federation saying \u2018well, we\u2019re doing everything we can.\u2019 No, you\u2019re not. And then you\u2019ve got the bloke who runs the FA here [Greg Clarke] pandering to Uefa, saying \u2018but they are trying really hard.\u2019 No they are not. They are not trying really hard. They are not trying hard enough. Do more. It\u2019s unacceptable. I should never go on to a football pitch waiting to be racially abused. No footballer on this planet should.\u201d\n\nLast season, Taylor was abused following a League One match in February against AFC Wimbledon, his former club, and on Twitter in March after he scored the winning goal against Bradford City. Taylor was sent a series of banana emojis from an account that was later deleted. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to hide behind fake names and this and that,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we stop people from signing up to social media platforms unless they have an [associated] passport or unless they have a driving licence? On top of that, the social media platforms have to take responsibility for it. They are basically giving someone a gun for somebody to put a bullet in and shoot that gun. If they are not going to stop or make these people accountable, then who\u2019s going to do it? They are making billions of pounds off of us using their platforms but they don\u2019t want to put any money into actually making this right.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lyle Taylor\u2019s aunt Lisa died of breast cancer almost two years ago and the striker says he is proud to \u2018do something better and bigger\u2019 than his football. Photograph: Benjamin Peters/Benjamin Peters/CAFC\n\nTaylor acknowledges racism is a societal issue and \u201ceveryone\u2019s problem\u201d but much of his frustration lies with the key stakeholders, who he argues do not take racism seriously enough below the glitz and glamour of England\u2019s top flight. \u201cThey don\u2019t care what happens outside of the Premier League, because the Premier League is where the money is. But what\u2019s actually changed since Raheem Sterling got racially abused by the Chelsea fan? Nothing. Every week there\u2019s a new story. Every damn week. Between now and Monday night, when all of the fixtures have been played across the country, we will hear another story and it will be the same old nonsense: \u2018We are going to do something, we need to kick it out.\u2019 Whatever, I don\u2019t want to hear you talking about \u2018we need to kick it out\u2019, we need to actually kick it out and do something about it. It\u2019s boring now. It\u2019s past the point of it even being lip service.\u201d\n\nThe more heartening story is undoubtedly the impact Taylor has had as a result of dying his hair pink for the second October running in aid of a cause close to his heart; almost two years ago his aunt, Lisa, died of breast cancer and three of his four grandparents have either had or live with cancer. Last year Taylor, who plans to visit Cancer Research UK\u2019s laboratory near Westminster, raised more than \u00a316,000 and this year he has raised \u00a314,000 and counting. Last weekend the Valley was a sea of pink, with one sponsor turning their advertising hoardings rose and supporters following suit; one dressed as a pink power ranger.\n\nTaylor, sidelined because of a knee injury, signed autographs in the club shop, where all profits from pink posters, wristbands and mugs went to charity. \u201cI\u2019ve been promoted from League Two, I\u2019ve been promoted from League One, I\u2019ve scored some very important goals, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to score a hat-trick and take home the match ball and all of these things, but nothing will be able to beat the fact that I\u2019ve been able to influence people in a good way and kind of get people out of their shells and out of their skins. I\u2019m proud of everything I\u2019ve done in football but I\u2019m even more proud I\u2019ve been able to do something better and bigger.\u201d\n\nAs for Charlton, who visit Bristol City on Wednesday, Taylor is looking forward to getting back on the pitch. He has scored in seven of the top eight tiers in the country, a record that dates back to playing for Danny Cowley at Concord before being signed by Eddie Howe at Bournemouth and, with Charlton seventh under Lee Bowyer following promotion last season, Taylor is thinking big. \u201cIf I got the chance to score a goal in the Premier League, I would say I\u2019ve done everything and much, much more than I ever dreamed I would do. I was told I wasn\u2019t good enough to play professionally and I\u2019m now in my 10th season, so I\u2019ve already won that battle. My career has been kind of based on proving people wrong so I\u2019m waiting for someone to tell me I can\u2019t do it so that I can prove them wrong.\u201d\n\nClick here to donate to Lyle Taylor\u2019s Cancer Research UK campaign", "description": "Striker says racism is happening at all levels in England but is more upbeat about dying his hair pink and the \u00a330,000 raised for Cancer Research UK", "authors": ["Ben Fisher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/737d82c02fe9361babca369d9f751fca5b572d8b/0_207_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cdf36dad87650b1182b1f5124b18a84b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
