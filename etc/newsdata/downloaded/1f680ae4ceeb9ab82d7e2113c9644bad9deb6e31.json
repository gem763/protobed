I was so envious, I think they read my mind because I scored an invite and that sealed the deal. I was hooked from day one and now I love to bore people to death about the benefits of ocean swimming.\n\nPool or ocean?\n\nThe ocean. It\u2019s like that moment in Pretty Woman where Edward takes Vivian to the opera and explains, \u201cPeople\u2019s reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it.\u201d That\u2019s ocean swimming. Once I tried it, I couldn\u2019t go back. It continually pushes you out of your comfort zone \u2013 do you like huge surf? Will you be comfortable swimming with sharks? Can you handle the stingers? Pool swimming is useful when I\u2019m travelling for work across Asia, but the ocean has my soul.\n\nHow often do you train?\n\nI try to get to Manly three or four times a week. A lot depends on my kids\u2019 schedule, but every night, the group checks in on the app and a carload commits. There\u2019s always hilarious commentary, and empathy, with the usual theme being that we\u2019re all pretty grateful to have a holiday each morning before we start our real day.\n\nUsual distance?\n\nOn a normal weekday, we swim 1.5 kilometres across Cabbage Tree Bay in Manly. In summer, we do 2.5km and 6km swims. We also participate in the Cole Classic at Manly and the Byron Bay and Whitehaven Beach (Hamilton Island) ocean swims. Next spring, we\u2019re off to Greece to swim some longer distances, which will be fun. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m the channel-swimming type, but I do admire their gumption.\n\nGregory is not in it for the competition but enjoys a swim in the Cole Classic event with friends. James Alcock\n\nDo you swim year round or just in summer?\n\nNo fair-weather swimming here. We go 365 days a year, rain or shine. I don\u2019t wear a wetsuit because they make me uncomfortable, and they\u2019re bloody hard work to get on. In winter, the temperature can drop down to about 15 degrees and your face feels like it\u2019s freezing off. But mostly it stays around 16-17 degrees, which is fresh.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about ocean swimming?\n\nThe clarity and abundant sea life are extraordinary, and that\u2019s the crux of it. Ocean swimming is not just about the exercise. For me, it\u2019s not competitive, which is a relief because most of my life I\u2019ve been super results oriented. Ocean swimming gives me a break from all that. It\u2019s an ongoing exercise in presence and acceptance.\n\nWhat do you think about when swimming?\n\nA huge benefit for me is the mental health factor \u2013 my stress seems to dissipate. I dissect work, kids, relationships, global warming, even The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, but the idea is just to lose yourself in the motion.\n\nTell us the swimmer you most admire\n\nWe swam with Susie O\u2019Neill at a Whitehaven Beach Ocean Swim event. She\u2019s there most years and I was quite giddy when we met her. She was such a champion and still looks and swims like a star.\n\nEver been in trouble swimming?\n\nNot long ago, we swam in huge surf and a lot of swimmers were getting out. As I swam back with a pal, the waves were growing and an old Manly Surf Life Saving Club pro who was with us shouted over the booming surf, \u201cThey\u2019re coming in big sets of four with a smaller two, and this is number three, so go now!\u201d We swam for our lives. My heart hasn\u2019t raced like that since I jumped out of a plane. I was pretty relieved to exit safely that day and even more grateful for the caring community of Manly ocean swimmers. The beach closed shortly after.\n\nAny bugbears?\n\nWe all agree the Manly Surf Life Saving Club change rooms could do with some love.\n\nlifeandleisure@afr.com", "description": "Ocean swimming has so many things going for it, says Pivotal Software\u2019s head of customer success and digital transformation.
