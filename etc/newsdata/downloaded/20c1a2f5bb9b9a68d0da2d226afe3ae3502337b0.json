Derby\n\nThe New York Fed added $104.483 billion in liquidity to financial markets Tuesday.\n\nThe injection of money to help keep short-term rates from being volatile came in two parts. The Fed intervened with overnight repurchase agreements that saw eligible banks submit $59.483 billion in Treasurys and mortgage securities, in which the Fed accepted all that was offered. The Fed also added money to the financial system with a $45 billion 14-day repo operation that saw dealers offer $47.9 billion in securities.\n\nFed repo interventions take in Treasury and mortgage securities from eligible banks in what is effectively a short-term loan of central-bank cash, collateralized by dealer-owned bonds. The Fed's liquidity injections are aimed at ensuring the financial system has enough liquidity and short-term borrowing rates remain well behaved.\n\nThe Fed recently increased the sizes of its temporary operations as the month's end and this week's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting approach. Fed data released Tuesday showed short-term rates are near where central bankers expected them to be.\n\nWrite to Michael S.
