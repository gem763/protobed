The government has scheduled a vote on an election for about 1800 GMT on Wednesday.\n\nBut opposition parties and rebels in his own party said they would not allow a no-deal Brexit to be \u201csmuggled\u201d through under the cover of an election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to dance to his tune,\u201d said Keir Starmer, the opposition Labour Party\u2019s point man on Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious what he\u2019s up to. He wants to intercept this bill having lost control of parliament and stop us finishing the task in hand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to vote with Boris Johnson today to deprive ourselves of the opportunity to complete the business that we\u2019ve just seized control of the house to do,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson has promised to lead the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Oct. 31 with or without a deal, raising fears that he could catapult the world\u2019s fifth largest economy into an abrupt departure from the bloc without agreement on how to handle everything from food regulations to car component imports.\n\nPARLIAMENT SHOWDOWN\n\nThe showdown between prime minister and parliament continues on Wednesday with a dizzy array of events planned including a vote on the attempt to block no deal, a vote on Johnson\u2019s election bid and weekly questions to the prime minister.\n\n\u201cBase case is pre-Brexit election, but not necessarily before the 31st October,\u201d U.S. investment bank Citi said. \u201cNo deal risk persists, but now wrapped in a general election.\u201d\n\nAn election would open up three main options: a Brexit-supporting government under Johnson, a Labour government led by veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn or a hung parliament that could lead to a coalition or minority government of some kind.\n\nIn a sign of just how far Brexit has distorted British politics, Johnson\u2019s Conservatives vowed to expel the 21 rebels - including the grandson of Britain\u2019s World War Two leader Winston Churchill and two former finance ministers - from the party. Johnson also lost his working majority in parliament.\n\n\u201cHow, in the name of all that is good and holy, is there no longer room in the Conservative Party for @NSoames?\u201d Ruth Davidson, who quit as the Conservatives\u2019 leader in Scotland last week, wrote on Twitter.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks in the House of Commons in London, Britain September 3, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS\n\nJohnson said he did not want a no-deal Brexit - which investors warn would roil financial markets and send shockwaves through the European economy - but it was necessary to put it on the table so that Britain could negotiate the result it wanted.\n\nThe EU has refused to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement reached with Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May last November, and there were reports in British newspapers that Johnson\u2019s top adviser Dominic Cummings had described negotiations as a sham.\n\nWhen asked on Wednesday if that was how he saw the Brexit negotiations with the EU, Cummings told Reuters: \u201cNo. I never said that.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will try to call a snap election on Wednesday after lawmakers seeking to prevent him taking Britain out of the European Union without a divorce deal dealt him a humbling parliamentary defeat.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426060478&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830LR"}
