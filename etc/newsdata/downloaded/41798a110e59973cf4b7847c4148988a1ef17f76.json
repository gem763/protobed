Some have gone so far as to blame the Armenians for their own massacre.\n\nErdogan launched \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d last week, which Turkish officials have admitted is intended to eradicate the ethnic Kurdish presence in Rojava, or Syrian Kurdistan, to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d for the return of some of the four million mostly Arab refugees currently in Turkey. Kurdish officials in Rojava say the displacement of the indigenous Kurdish population is akin to ethnic cleansing.\n\nMany Kurds and others, in the region and abroad, have blamed President Donald Trump for \u201cOperation Peace Spring,\u201d as Trump announced he would relocate troops in Rojava to other areas of Syria given the lack of an Islamic State threat in the region currently. Trump is only legally authorized to use military action against al-Qaeda and its affiliates as per the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) Congress passed in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The Islamic State is an offshoot of al-Qaeda formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq and Syria.\n\nErdogan, departing Azerbaijan for a summit visit there, attempted to assure the world that Turkey would attempt genocide against the Kurdish people by pointing to Turkey\u2019s history \u2013 which, he failed to note, includes modern history\u2019s first genocide.\n\n\u201cTurkey has never committed any civilian massacre in its history and it never will. Our religion and culture would never allow to do it,\u201d Erdogan alleged, according to Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for civilian massacres, look at Afghanistan, Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state, Upper Karabakh, and Bosnia,\u201d where Muslims were slaughtered late in the last century and in this one, Erdogan said. \u201cIf you want to see civilian massacres, look at Cyprus before Turkey\u2019s intervention, look at Palestine just under your nose, where the Muslims are deliberately killed in the streets.\u201d\n\nErdogan excluded the mass internment of Muslims in concentration camps in Xinjiang, China \u2013 where many are being murdered, forcibly sterilized, or cut open for their vital organs \u2013 from his list of alleged genocides against Muslims around the world. Chinese media have previously quoted him supporting the concentration camps.\n\nErdogan insisted once again that the Turkish military is fighting \u201cterrorists\u201d in Rojava, not \u201cSyrians.\u201d Ankara regularly refers to all Kurds as \u201cterrorists\u201d and has arrested dozens of Kurdish politicians and allies from the People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP) for unsubstantiated accusations of \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish president also rejected any attempt to dialogue with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the largely Kurdish militia that allied with the United States to destroy the physical Islamic State centered in Raqqa.\n\n\u201cThe Republic of Turkey never in its history sat down at a table with terrorist groups. We are not looking for a mediator for that,\u201d he said.\n\nErdogan\u2019s claim that the Turks have never perpetrated a civilian massacre ignores the murder of 75 percent of the Armenian population existing in 1915, about 1.5 million people. Another nearly million Christians of Assyrian and Greek descent were massacred in the process of creating a \u201cTurkish\u201d state. Referring to the Armenian genocide as a \u201cgenocide\u201d is illegal in Turkey.\n\nTurkish officials typically claim that the killings either never occurred, were much less numerous than historians claim, or that the Armenians committed genocide against themselves. During the internationally observed anniversary of the Armenian genocide this year, Erdogan instead argued that the killings and relocation of millions of Armenians out of their homes in Turkey was \u201creasonable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe relocation of the Armenian gangs and their supporters, who massacred the Muslim people, including women and children, in eastern Anatolia, was the most reasonable action that could be taken in such a period,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cThe doors of our archives are wide open to all seeking the truth.\u201d\n\nErdogan has for months discussed a similar relocation plan of Kurds out of Syria.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming in the first phase to create safe zones where four million Syrians who now live in our country can return,\u201d Erdogan said in January. The \u201csafe zone\u201d would be in Rojava, created by the removal of the SDF and Kurdish civilians to allow for the establishment of a Syrian Arab population there. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) NGO called the plan \u201cdemographic change\u201d at the time.\n\nGulnur Aybet, a senior Erdogan adviser, confirmed this week that the two objectives in \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d are the removal of indigenous Kurdish populations, which she referred to as a \u201cterrorist group,\u201d and \u201cthe return of about one to two million Syrian refugees,\u201d most of which are of Arab descent.\n\nTens of thousands of Kurds in Europe protested this weekend against \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in the service of \u201cjihad,\u201d their interpretation of Erdogan\u2019s plan. Erdogan is an openly Islamist leader who publicly supports the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn response to \u201cOperation Peace Spring,\u201d President Trump announced this week that he had prepared an executive order increasing Turkish steel tariffs to 50 percent and personally targeting Turkish officials committing human rights crimes.\n\n\u201cThe Order will authorize a broad range of consequences, including financial sanctions, the blocking of property, and barring entry into the United States,\u201dthe president said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is clear. We\u2019re not worried about any sanctions,\u201d Erdo\u011fan responded on Tuesday.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Islamist Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan falsely claimed that Turkey had never \"carried out any civilian massacres.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/4-24-19-anniversary-armenian-genocide-la-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
