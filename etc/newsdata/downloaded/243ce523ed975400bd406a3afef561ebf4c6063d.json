His popularity took a further hit with the emergence during the campaign of old photographs of him in blackface makeup.\n\nThe scandals, which also included his bullying of his attorney general, could still be investigated by federal police.\n\nDefeated Conservative leader Andrew Scheer warned that Canada's oil sector, which is struggling with low prices and a lack of pipeline capacity, is \"under attack\" from climate activists and government policies.\n\nHe said the environmental protections of the Trudeau Liberals, who campaigned for tougher climate action, could be further devastating.\n\nWarning\n\nTrudeau \"must be willing to change course, to stop his attacks on the energy sector, and to recognise when western Canada succeeds all of Canada succeeds,\" said Scheer.\n\nThe Conservatives won 121 seats but beat the Liberals in the popular vote, taking 34.4% to their 33.1%.\n\nAlthough Trudeau did better than expected, Scheer issued a warning to the prime minister, saying Canadians had \"passed judgement\" on him and the Liberals.\n\n\"We have put him on notice, his leadership is damaged and his government will end soon and when that time comes, the Conservatives will be ready and we will win!\"\n\nTrudeau, a 47-year-old former school teacher, dominated Canadian politics over the four years of his first term, but faced a grilling during the 40-day election campaign, which he described as one of the \"dirtiest and nastiest\" in Canadian history.\n\nYves-Francois Blanchet, head of the Bloc Quebecois, a down-and-out party that scored a big comeback on Monday, said he could work with the new government if the interests of French-speaking Quebec are preserved.\n\n\"Our top consideration is Quebec,\" said Blanchet, whose party will have 32 seats in the next parliament.\n\n\"We will do things on a case-by-case basis. If it helps Quebec, we'll be in favor. If it doesn't, we won't,\" he said.", "description": "A weakened Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has set out to secure the support of smaller parties he will need to form a government after winning Canada's nail-biter general election but falling short of a majority.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9382/54bd8f54e8ce4002be16e189512964ea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
