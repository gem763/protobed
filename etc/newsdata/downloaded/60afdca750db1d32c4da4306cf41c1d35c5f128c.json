And that's a big reason why CBC Arts asked the artist (whose work is currently featured in the Art Gallery of Hamilton's indie comics exhibition) to revamp our logo. It's Women's History Month here in Canada, and in Woodall's hands, we're strutting into October with some mighty company.\n\nGet to know her!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName: Jenn Woodall\n\nAge: 33\n\nHomebase: Toronto\n\nLet's talk about your design! What inspired your take on the CBC Arts logo?\n\nI was approached to do the logo for Women's History Month which I was really excited about since the majority of my work focuses on depicting women. I wanted to design a logo that represents a variety of women from various backgrounds to try and make as inclusive a design as possible.\n\nFrom what I've seen, badass women are all over your comics and artwork, and whether they're holding baseball bats or magic wands, they seem like they could take anyone in a fight. How did you start drawing these awesome tough girls?\n\nI grew up watching Sailor Moon, Power Rangers and X-Men, so I think those things had a big influence on a younger me. I started doing these types of illustration when I attended university in my early 20s. I was studying fashion design at the time, and I think this art was part of a reaction against the sexist and often limiting way women are represented in fashion advertising. I also started reading alternative comics at this time as well, which really inspired me to start drawing with a renewed personal focus.\n\nWhy did it become a focus?\n\nHonestly, I just started making this work because I genuinely enjoyed doing it. In retrospect, I think it was a way to channel my frustrations and anger into something productive. I always had sketchbooks of these types of drawings, but I didn't share that work very often. But when I did start sharing it with others, I was really surprised at the positive response and how others seemed to find a sense of empowerment from my work. So I started to focus on this more personal type of work more and more. Now when I'm sought out for jobs, it is almost always in reference to this type of work I make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't realize that you work in film wardrobe, too! I am very tempted to ask you a million questions about the Handmaid's Tale costumes, but I'll ask you this instead: how does that work influence what you do as an illustrator?\n\nYes, I actually worked as a costume designer/builder before I switched to focusing on illustration and comics. I've always had a love of fashion/costume and I think it comes across obviously in my work. I put most of my characters in stylish streetwear but I've also done illustrations of girls in futuristic space suits. I think style is just another vehicle for self-expression which can not only be used in your real life but in your art and your world-building.\n\nWhat's the project you're most proud of?\n\nOne of them would be getting to do the illustrations for Girl Squads by Sam Maggs. It's a book detailing important female friendships across history which had huge cultural impacts. It was a very fun project and I was really passionate about the topic, plus I've known Sam for a while and she was great to work with.\n\nWho is the last artist you discovered online?\n\nI've been really loving the work that Olivia Fields and Little Thunder post on social media. I would recommend seeking them both out.\n\nWhat work of art do you wish you owned?\n\nI have always wanted to own a piece of Moebius (Jean Giraud) artwork. Or I would love to own a piece of original Moyoco Anno artwork.\n\nWhat's your favourite place to see art?\n\nThe internet! That's what I use social media for the most. My Instagram and Twitter almost exclusively follow artists. But I do also love going to art shows, exhibits and museums whenever I can.\n\nWhere can we see more from you?\n\nMy website is jennwoodall.com but I also have Instagram (@funeralbeat) and Twitter (@jenn_woodall).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery month, we feature a new take on the CBC Arts logo created by a Canadian artist.
