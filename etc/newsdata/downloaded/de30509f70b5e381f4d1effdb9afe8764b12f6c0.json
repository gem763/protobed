I think that this conference should thrash it out.\"\n\nThornberry, was joined by Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer and Labour's Deputy Leader Tom Watson, and London mayor Sadiq Khan whp also attended a People's Vote rally on Saturday in support of a second referendum.\n\nKhan warned on Sunday that staying neutral on Brexit was \"not an option.\"\n\nIn a direct challenge to the leader, he wrote: \"I'm making a direct appeal to delegates at Labour conference: do not accept any \"compromise\" on Brexit, do not accept a fudge, do not delay us setting out what our stance would be in any future referendum.\"\n\nActivists also pointed out that the vast majority of local constituency Labour parties [CLPs] had submitted motions in favour of Labour adopting an explicitly Remain position.\n\n\"We don't need a special conference after the election to decide our policy,\" Michael Chessum, a pro-European Labour activist, told Business Insider.\n\n\"We have a conference literally right now at which 90 CLPs have submitted anti-Brexit policies. We know what our members think about Brexit, we know what trade unions think about Brexit, we know what our voters think about Brexit.\n\n\"We need to go into this general election with our voters and our members reassured that we understand them and are on their side when it comes to the main issue of the day.\"\n\n\"Labour members are not going to tolerate another fudge for another year.\"\n\n\"Labour members are not going to tolerate another fudge for another year.\"\n\nThe leadership was rocked on Sunday by the revelation that Corbyn's policy adviser Andrew Fisher, who wrote the 2017 Labour manifesto, had resigned. In a damning memo obtained by the Sunday Times, Fisher accused staff in the leader's office of \"lack of professionalism, competence and human decency\" and their \"blizzard of lies and excuses.\"\n\nOn the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Corbyn suggested the UK could be better off outside the EU, saying it \"depends on the agreement you have with the European Union outside.\"\n\nHe added: \"I will go along with whatever decision the party comes to.\"", "description": "Labour's annual conference is chaos over Jeremy Corbyn's refusal to back Remain.
