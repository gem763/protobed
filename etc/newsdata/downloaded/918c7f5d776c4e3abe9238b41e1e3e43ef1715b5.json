Of course I would,\u201d he told a Politico event at conference. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty clear idea, I think, of where the members are on this, therefore I think it\u2019s very likely that the members will want us to campaign for remain.\u201d\n\nBrexit disputes have damaged Corbyn\u2019s leadership, and on Monday even some of his closest allies said his plan to force through his idea was \u201ca travesty\u201d.\n\nJon Lansman, whose leftist Momentum movement was created to support Corbyn, had urged Labour members \u201cto vote with their conscience\u201d, and the country\u2019s biggest union, Unison, had said it would back the \u201cremain\u201d stance because it was worried ambiguity could hurt the party\u2019s election chances.\n\nBritain's Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn delivers his keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool, Britain, September 26, 2018.

He said on Sunday it was more important to hold the party together by embracing its \u201cremainers\u201d and those who want to leave the bloc.\n\nAsked whether Labour would campaign to stay in the EU or to leave with a deal, Corbyn said he would be guided by his party.\n\n\u201cI am leading the party, I am proud to lead the party, I am proud of the democracy of the party and of course I will go along with whatever decision the party comes to,\u201d Corbyn said.", "description": "British opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn won support for his Brexit strategy on Monday, fighting off a challenge by members who wanted him to immediately back remaining in the European Union before any election.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432870411&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0G3", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
