I can see the rest of the field leaving it to him to get on with things and if that\u2019s the case then it should mean he\u2019s even harder to pass. It\u2019s a shame only six go to post in this but at 16/1 I think he rates a good bet.\n\nAnd don't forget, Betfair Sportsbook are offering a free bet of up to \u00a325 for every winner at 3/1 or over during ITV racing on Saturday (free bet matching original stake, max \u00a325).\n\nThe ability to handle the ground, a good record of winning at this time of year, and no questions about staying the trip are all reasons why Ian Williams\u2019 five-year-old Time To Study in the 14:55 at Doncaster rates a solid each-way bet at 12/1.\n\nHe has one win on very soft ground in France, two wins on soft and he\u2019s been placed twice on heavy ground, so today\u2019s ground should hold no fears. His record shows he\u2019s won in late October in 2017 and mid-November in 2016 so we know he\u2019s been near his best historically at this time of year. He\u2019s also won over 1m6.5f, so this heavy ground 1m4f contest should see him staying on at the finish when plenty others may be struggling.\n\nThrow in that he has a good 5lb claimer taking weight off his back, the superbly named Thore Hammer Hansen, and the fact that the Williams stable have had a winner this week then we have a strong case for another good each-way bet.", "description": "While the Nation Hunt season hits top gear there\u2019s still an excellent card on Doncaster\u2019s final Flat meeting of the year, and Alan Thompson has two each-way bets to consider\u2026", "authors": ["Alan Thompson", "Dave Masters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18993599.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_bet-fair.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
