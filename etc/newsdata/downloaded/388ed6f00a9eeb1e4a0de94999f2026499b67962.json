So there was the former White House press secretary on the ABC reality show\u2019s 28th season premiere on Monday night, wearing a frilly yellow shirt that evoked Big Bird and a pair of tight-fitting white pants.\n\nIt didn\u2019t get any better after that.\n\nSpicer\u2019s big segment didn\u2019t come until the end of the premiere\u2019s second hour.\n\n\u201cI was Donald Trump\u2019s first White House press secretary,\u201d he said by way of introduction. \u201cThere's no question my time in the White House was tumultuous.\u201d After a montage of some of the least damning moments from his tenure, Spicer embarrassed himself further by gushing over the tweet Trump put out congratulating him on the reality gig. \u201cIt's nice to have the leader of the free world on your side when it comes to getting votes,\u201d he added.\n\nSpicer was paired up with season 25 champion dancer Lindsay Arnold, who described her partner as dancing at a \u201cpre-pre-school level,\u201d adding, \u201cHe definitely isn\u2019t natural at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t part of the plan,\u201d Spicer told The New Yorker this week. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m just making money, trying to enjoy life.\u201d He will reportedly earn a minimum of $125,000 to appear on the show. Even host Tom Bergeron has expressed his displeasure with the casting.\n\nWhen it came time to dance, Spicer banged some bongos and attempted a salsa to The Spice Girls\u2019 \u201cSpice Up Your Life,\u201d ending with an exuberant knee slide.\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201d one of the judges asked when he was done. \u201cIt's like you were being attacked by a swarm of wasps.\u201d The best he could say was that it was \u201cstrangely entertaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were off-beat most of the dance,\u201d another added. \u201cBut you had fun!\u201d The team ended up getting a total score of 12 out of 30 for the night, just barely beating Lamar Odom, who ended up with 11.", "description": "\u201cIt's like you were being attacked by a swarm of wasps,\u201d one judge said after Spicer attempted a salsa dance.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568686742/SS2_jttbhn", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
