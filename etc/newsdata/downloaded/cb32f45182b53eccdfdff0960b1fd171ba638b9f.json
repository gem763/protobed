Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: \u201cTime is running out.\u201d Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an \u201coverwhelming\u201d consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns \u201cit is distinctly possible\u201d that CO2 emissions from the company\u2019s 50-year plan \u201cwill later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth\u2019s population)\u201d. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that \u201cthe greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now\u201d. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: \u201cThose who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect \u2026 As president, I intend to do something about it.\u201d A confidential report prepared for Shell\u2019s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be \u201cthe greatest in recorded history\u201d. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. \u201cBy the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,\u201d it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell\u2019s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a \u201cpossibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation\u201d. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world\u2019s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: \u201cThe US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.\u201d Two month\u2019s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: \u201cLet\u2019s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.\u201d The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the \u201cClimategate\u201d misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is \u201cuncertain\u201d, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts, Garry Blight and Pablo Guti\u00e9rrez\n\nThe bill will be discussed by the prime minister Giuseppe Conte\u2019s cabinet on Thursday afternoon. Other measures include giving public transport season tickets to those who stop using their cars, mopeds or scooters, a \u20ac20m (\u00a318m) investment in electric and hybrid school buses, an urban reforestation plan and an environmental campaign in schools.\n\n\u201cWe have norms that will counteract the climate emergency at 360 degrees,\u201d Sergio Costa, the environment minister, wrote on Facebook.\n\nConte told a conference on Thursday that Italy is seeking to be a leader in making the economy more sustainable. He had promised to make environmental action a priority in a speech before the new left-leaning government, a coalition of the Five Star Movement (M5S) and Democratic party, was voted into power in early September. Conte also made a dramatic call for urgent action at the recent UN climate action summit in New York after news emerged that a massive portion of a Mont Blanc glacier was in danger of collapse.\n\nLuigi Di Maio, whose M5S party has long prioritised the environment in its campaigning, said the climate bill represents \u201ca new vision of a green Italy\u201d that would put the country at the forefront in Europe.\n\nQ&A Why is the Guardian changing the language it uses about the environment? Show Hide The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. Instead of \u201cclimate change\u201d, the preferred terms are \u201cclimate emergency, crisis or breakdown\u201d and \u201cglobal heating\u201d is favoured over \u201cglobal warming\u201d. The scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world\u2019s scientists. In October 2018, they said carbon emissions must halve by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May 2019, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and destruction of the ecosystems that support all life on Earth. The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, says: \u201cWe want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase \u2018climate change\u2019, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.\u201d Other terms that have been updated include the use of \u201cwildlife\u201d rather than \u201cbiodiversity\u201d, \u201cfish populations\u201d instead of \u201cfish stocks\u201d and \u201cclimate science denier\u201d rather than \u201cclimate sceptic\u201d. Damian Carrington Environment editor\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to assess what kind of impact each measure will have but for sure, this decree is a start,\u201d said Gianfranco Pellegrino, a politics professor at Rome\u2019s Luiss University who has written extensively about climate change. \u201cThe environment minister is taking climate change seriously and this is an improvement in respect of previous ministers. We need a law because we can\u2019t confront the climate emergency without legislation.\u201d\n\nAmong Italy\u2019s biggest challenges is tackling the huge amount of plastic littering the country\u2019s shores, with alarming data published on Thursday by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (Ispra) revealing that more than 500,000 tonnes of plastic waste end up in the Mediterranean each year. The waste is mostly comprised of shopping bags, plastic bottles and product packaging. The data was collated with the help of fishermen, who reported that their nets now collect more waste than fish. Ispra also said Italian beaches \u201chost\u201d between 500 and 1,000 items of rubbish every 100 metres.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Plastic waste brought ashore in Livorno, Tuscany. Photograph: Laura Lezza/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe situation in the Mediterranean is serious,\u201d said Cecilia Silvestri, a researcher at Ispra.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the Mediterranean is a closed basin \u2026 and it is compromised because of rubbish that gets dumped in the sea in north African countries that don\u2019t yet have a sufficient waste management system. The rubbish circulates and ends up near our coastline.\u201d\n\nProfile Plastic - what's the problem? Show Hide Why the sudden focus on plastics? Mankind produces roughly its entire body weight in plastics every year. But the vast majority of it is either not recycled, unrecyclable, or doesn't get reused once it's been recycled. Volumes ending up in the natural environment are surging. Plastic can take as much as 500 years to decompose.\n\nWhat are the implications? Plastic is ubiquitous \u2013 and often deadly. It kills sea creatures that eat it but cannot digest it. It gets into the human food chain by contaminating the fish that we eat. It is even in our tap water. There is no science about the long-term impact of humans ingesting plastic.\n\nWhat is to be done? Taxing plastic bags \u2013 or even banning them outright as Kenya has done \u2013 has changed consumer and producer behaviour. But what next? Deposit return schemes for plastic bottles work well in several countries. Charging for one-time coffee cups also seems to be on the agenda. But the real solutions may not be top down but ...\n\n... bottom up? Yes. Grassroots movements led the way on plastic bags, and have spawned others such as Refill, which emphasises reusing bottles, and A Plastic Planet, which urges plastic-free aisles in supermarkets. Popular culture remains hugely important: it's just possible that the British series The Blue Planet has changed attitudes overnight.\n\nPhotograph: Zakir Chowdhury/Barcroft Images/Barcroft Media\n\nPlastic is also heavily polluting Italy\u2019s lakes. \u201cI was in Lake Como recently and discovered the lake is the most polluted in Europe with microplastic,\u201d said Pellegrino. \u201cPlastic is a real problem and needs to be addressed very soon.\u201d\n\nPollution is another major issue, especially in Italy\u2019s northern cities. While Italy\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing over the past decade, the country was criticised this year by the European Climate Foundation for failing to provide an adequate plan to further reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cEmissions remain a problem and another issue is extinctions \u2013 in Italy there are many species that are close to dying off,\u201d added Pellegrino.\n\nAn estimated 1 million Italian schoolchildren took part in a global climate strike inspired by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg on 27 September.", "description": "Coalition tackles climate crisis with incentives for reducing plastic and use of cars, mopeds or scooters", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f30d83f3de63cb537ec817ba031903bef06d9e2/0_114_5296_3178/master/5296.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=35ce782f2cdfa5bc25d71ee170a5e1e0", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
