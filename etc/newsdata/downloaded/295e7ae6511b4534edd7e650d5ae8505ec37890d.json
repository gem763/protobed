And one of our best values in America is free speech. We\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say and we\u2019re allowed to speak up on injustices, and that\u2019s just how it goes.\u201d\n\nMorey\u2019s initial tweet of a graphic, which stated, \u201cFight For Freedom Stand With Hong Kong,\u201d resulted in a PR nightmare for the NBA. Morey quickly deleted the tweet, which was followed by an initial statement from the NBA distancing the league from Morey. The move resulted in widespread criticism from U.S. politicians. When NBA commissioner Adam Silver later attempted to defend Morey\u2019s right to free expression, major Chinese corporate sponsors dropped the league and announced boycotts of NBA broadcasts.\n\nO\u2019Neal\u2019s comments came after James said last week that Morey was not \u201ceducated on the situation at hand,\u201d and that \u201cif you don\u2019t feel like you should speak upon things, you shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever you see something going on wrong anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say that\u2019s not right, and that\u2019s what he did,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201c. . . Here, we have the right to speak. And especially with social media, we\u2019re going to say whatever we want to say, when we want to say it.\u201d", "description": "Daryl Morey has faced heavy backlash for his tweet, which led to criticism from NBA star LeBron James and Chinese censorship of the league.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
