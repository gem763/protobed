Henry Cuellar of Texas, was a case in point. On Tuesday morning, Cuellar said that the House committees investigating Trump should \u201ccontinue\u201d their work before the House formally took up impeachment proceedings. The stance made Cuellar, a member of the centrist Blue Dog Caucus, an outlier among Texas\u2019 House Democrats, all of whom had backed impeachment by then.\n\nCisneros blasted him. Cuellar\u2019s statement, she said, \u201cproves he\u2019d rather toe the Trump line than take a stand for our country and this community.\u201d\n\nBut what happened next illustrates the difficulty for Cisneros and other primary challengers hoping to capitalize on the march toward impeachment.\n\nCisneros\u2019 attack apparently hit the mark. Cuellar began to change his tune later in the day. In a revised statement, Cuellar said, \u201cNo one is above the law and if investigations prove that impeachment is the necessary course of action, then I will be forced to act on impeachment proceedings.\u201d The stronger rhetoric was enough for The New York Times and Politico to count him among their tallies of House Democrats who are at least supportive of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nCisneros took credit for the shift on social media.\n\nBut the back-and-forth illustrates a challenge for Cisneros and her fellow insurgent candidates as they seek to capitalize on an issue where they had led: They are victims of their own success.\n\nVirtually every House Democrat facing a primary challenge from the left has lent their support to an impeachment inquiry against Trump, including several who changed their stance after challengers announced their runs and others, like Cuellar, who came around to the idea just in the past few days.\n\nThese candidates have been appealing to voters to reward them for their integrity \u2015 for supporting impeachment and other tough-minded policies before it became politically expedient.\n\nBut now that the incumbents they are facing support the same underlying stance, the challengers have a trickier case to make to voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to make that argument,\u201d said Mike Mikus, a Pittsburgh-based Democratic campaign consultant. Support for impeachment is \u201cjust enough to muddy the waters.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegardless of the issue, if a candidate flip-flops in their direction, voters are much more forgiving than if you flip against them,\u201d Mikus added.\n\nThe pattern in the Cisneros-Cuellar contest is mirrored most closely by the dynamic in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District, where former Flagstaff City Councilwoman Eva Putzova is challenging Democratic Rep. Tom O\u2019Halleran.\n\nO\u2019Halleran, an ex-Republican who has represented the vast swing seat since 2017, was until Friday one of the last Democratic holdouts against impeachment \u2015 and the only House Democrat from his state not to get on board. Putzova called him out about it on Twitter, arguing that it was \u201ctime for #TimidTom to go.\u201d\n\nBy Wednesday, after a statement earlier in the week declining to endorse impeachment, O\u2019Halleran declared that he supported an impeachment inquiry.\n\nOther incumbents\u2019 shifts have been more subtle but likewise notable for their timing. Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, under threat from Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse, came out for the impeachment inquiry after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did on Tuesday. Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York, who faces primary challenges from Long Island activist Melanie D\u2019Arrigo and former prosecutor Michael Weinstock, also endorsed an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday morning.\n\nAnd back in July, Rep. Eliot Engel of New York backed an impeachment inquiry. Engel cited special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony before Congress as the proximate cause. But Engel also made the announcement just over a month after middle school principal Jamaal Bowman announced a primary run against him.", "description": "\"For a lot of centrist Democrats facing primaries, impeachment gave them a chance to flash their anti-Trump credentials,\" said one Democratic strategist.", "authors": ["Daniel Marans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8qQ9XhFncMUzD0UOypr8iQ--~B/aD00MzAwO3c9NjQ0OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e9c21220000310053e929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
