Maybe I jumped out of the boat too quickly when I didn't play for three months.\n\n'When I look at other players having a great career at Manchester United, they all had a spell of four or five months when they didn't play.'\n\nSchneiderlin has often been criticised for his conservative style of play but he's now hit back at detractors who he says don't understand the purpose of his role.\n\nThe midfielder also defended his style of play, which he's compared to Sergio Busquets\n\n'If you are in midfield, you are 1-0 down and your team has run after the ball for a minute and I try a long pass and miss it, people might clap because it is an attacking move, but my team-mates might have to for another two minutes to get the ball back,' he added.\n\n'If we are winning 1-0 and I make a short pass that allows the team to breathe, people think it is clever. Some people say I pass square but I don't see it.\n\n'Look at [Sergio] Busquets at Barcelona. I don't compare myself to him but tell me the passes he does that I don't? Because they win games, everyone says he's the cleverest midfielder in football.\n\n'Football is about perception. You can play the same game, but it will be analysed differently depending on whether you have won or lost.'", "description": "Morgan Schneiderlin has admitted he may have left Manchester United too soon when he joined Everton in 2017 after losing his place following the appointment of Jose Mourinho.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/20200472-0-image-a-52_1572042885024.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
