Trump sent Turkish President Recep Tayyip Ergodan on October 9, asking the NATO ally to not slaughter the Kurds unless he wanted to face dire economic consequences imposed by the Trump administration.\n\n\"Dear Mr. President, Let's work out a deal! You don't want to to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy -- and I will. I've already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson,\" the president said. Andrew Brunson was a captured American pastor held by the Turkish government. President Trump used a mixture of diplomacy and economic pressure to get him freed.\n\n\"I have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don't the world down. You can make a great deal,\" the president continued.\n\n\"History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way,\" President Trump stated. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen.\"\n\n\"Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!\" he said before signing off, \"I'll call you later.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE: I have obtained a copy of ?@realDonaldTrump?\u2019s letter to #Erdogan. ?@POTUS? warns him to not \u201cbe a tough guy!
