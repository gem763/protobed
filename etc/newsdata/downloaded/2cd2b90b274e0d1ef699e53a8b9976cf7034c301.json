He allegedly told the informant he wanted to kill members of the far-left group antifa as well as destroy cellphone towers or a local news station.\n\nHe also discussed using a vehicle bomb to attack the headquarters of an unidentified \u201cmajor American news network,\u201d prosecutors say.\n\nCourt documents quote Mr. Smith as saying the attack could include \u201ca large vehicle bomb.\u201d\n\n\u201cFill a vehicle full of [explosives] then fill a ping pong ball with [commonly available chemical] via drilling then injection.

I don\u2019t know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith was arrested by the FBI on Sept. 21, the Justice Department said.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
