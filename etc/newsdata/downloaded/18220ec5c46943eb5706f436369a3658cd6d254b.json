She is to speak Tuesday at the University of Arkansas. All 16,000 tickets for the event, at the Verizon Arena, in North Little Rock, Ark., have been distributed. Thousands of people remain on the waiting list.\n\nRather than weary her, the demands of the Supreme Court have helped her through health problems, Justice Ginsburg said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best and the hardest job that I ever had, and it has kept me going through four cancer bouts,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of concentrating on my aches and pains I know that I have to\u2026surmount whatever is going on in my body and concentrate on the court\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nJustice Ginsburg didn\u2019t comment directly on recent cases, but she did discuss her 2015 opinion, by a 5-4 vote, upholding the constitutionality of state-created commissions to draw legislative and congressional districts. In the wake of the court\u2019s June decision, also 5-4, that partisan gerrymanders cannot be challenged in federal court, state-based measures remain the only practical avenue to curb such practices.\n\n\u201cSomething needed to be done about the partisan gerrymander,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said Saturday. \u201cThere was very little incentive to vote, because your district had been rigged\u201d by partisan majorities in the state legislature to elect either a Democrat or a Republican rather than hold communities together or create competitive races, she said.\n\nIn 2000, Arizona voters approved a ballot initiative that transferred redistricting power to an independent commission. The state legislature sued, contending that it alone could draw the maps under the constitutional provision providing that each state\u2019s legislature should prescribe \u201cthe times, places and manner of holding elections.\u201d\n\nJustice Ginsburg\u2019s opinion reasoned that, in giving voters direct lawmaking power through the initiative process, states such as Arizona had made the people themselves the legislature.\n\nThe interviewer, NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg, observed that Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the June opinion rejecting federal remedies for partisan gerrymanders, had pointed to state voter initiatives as a possible alternative to curb the practice\u2014despite having dissented from Justice Ginsburg\u2019s 2015 opinion.\n\n\u201cAs one lives, one learns,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said. \u201cI think the chief learned he was wrong in the Arizona case.\u201d Ms. Ginsburg dissented from the June opinion.\n\nJustice Ginsburg appeared at the book festival, an annual event organized by the Library of Congress, in connection with \u201cMy Own Words,\u201d a collection of her writings from eighth grade through her Supreme Court years. It was compiled by Georgetown law professors Mary Hartnett and Wendy Williams, who joined the justice on stage. The two have been working on her authorized biography since 2004.\n\nMs. Williams said the pair typically interviewed Justice Ginsburg for the biography each year for three days at the end of August. This year was different, she said, because of Ms. Ginsburg\u2019s treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. \u201cShe remembered everything and she was perfectly normal, but she was very tired\u201d during two days of interviews in New York, Ms. Williams said. \u201cAnd then we came down yesterday and did our third day\u201d in Washington.\n\nMs. Hartnett said they had expected the biography to have been published before the writing collection, to \u201cbreak the story of Justice Ginsburg.\u201d Instead, the justice\u2019s career broke out on its own when she reached her 80s, exploding as pop culture\u2019s Notorious RBG. She has been portrayed in movies and as a recurring character on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and entered a feminist pantheon for decades of effort to secure equal rights for women.\n\nThe biographers now intend to tell the full, complete story, of Justice Ginsburg, Ms. Hartnett said. \u201cHopefully it will not come out very soon,\u201d she added.\n\nWrite to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com", "description": "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sought Saturday to dispel concerns over her health, telling a packed audience at the National Book Festival that she was readying to plunge into the Supreme Court term opening October.", "authors": ["Jess Bravin"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103160/social"}
