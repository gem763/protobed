That is an effort ultimately to kneecap ... the president of the United States. This president or any other president, it is a horrific precedent.\"\n\nTRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL\n\nHe said if the whistleblower, as a former intelligence officer, is being used to \"take out\" the president, then he or she should have to testify in front of Congress. According to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll, 73 percent of Americans want the whistleblower to testify publicly while approving of the impeachment inquiry by a margin of 49-46.\n\n\"You better stand up and do it publicly,\" said Wright, blasting House Democrats for seemingly being uninterested in collecting additional facts about the phone call.\n\n\"This isn't about trying to get facts. We've already decided, as a partisan Democratic Party. I'm sorry to say, we've already decided we have to get rid of the president. We're moving forward with it, irrespective of facts. That is clear.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHouse Democrats are moving full speed ahead with the impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week, with reports indicating lawmakers plan to move quickly with their investigation and could file articles of impeachment before year's end.\n\nIt comes after the public release of both the whistleblower's complaint and a transcript of the July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Trump requested that Ukraine investigate the Biden family.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint alleges that Trump used the \"power of his office to solicit interference\" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to \"lock down\" records of that phone call. Democrats have accused Trump of an implied quid pro quo, using U.S. military aid. The White House has vigorously denied the two matters were linked.\n\nREAD THE COMPLAINT", "description": "The impeachment inquiry set in motion by House Democrats this week is setting a \"horrific precedent\" and the whistleblower must testify before Congress, former CIA officer Bryan Dean Wright argued on \"Fox & Friends\" Friday.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/pelosi-wright-schiff-AP-FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
