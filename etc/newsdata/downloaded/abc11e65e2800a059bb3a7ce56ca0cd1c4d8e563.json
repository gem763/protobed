That\u2019s certainly been the case the last eleven times these two nations have met, including twice previously at World Cup level.\n\nAnd yet. With Fiji one of the so-called \u201ctier two\u201d nations that\u2019s very much on the rise, packed with explosive individual talent, there\u2019s a lurking suspicion the powerhouses at rugby sevens level might just be ready to step up and make a huge statement in the 15-a-side game.\n\nIt\u2019s a clash that has \u201cbanana skin\u201d written all over it - especially for a Wallabies side coming off hugely indifferent form over the past 18 months, despite the recent win over New Zealand.\n\nWhatever happens, it\u2019s likely to be fast, furious, and above all, hugely entertaining - so strap in and enjoy the ride!", "description": "Minute-by-minute report: Can the Wallabies get their campaign in Japan off to a winning start?
