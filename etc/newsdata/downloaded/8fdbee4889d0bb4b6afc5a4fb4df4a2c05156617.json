And I think it's fair after what the Trumps are going through regarding Russia, that somebody look at the connection with the Bidens while the vice president was a sitting vice president, the Biden connection to the Ukraine through its son.\"\n\n\"Now you can't have it one way and look at one family and not the other. And I don't trust the media to do this and I'm hoping somebody that the Department of Justice will appoint an investigator to look at all things Ukraine, like we looked at all things Russia,\" Graham said.\n\nGraham's call for an investigation comes after reports of President Donald Trump's calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Zelenski to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Biden over widely discredited allegations of impropriety, the Wall Street Journal reported. Giuliani has suggested that the vice president used his power to shied a Ukrainian gas company from an investigation. Biden's son, Hunter, is on the gas company's board of directors.\n\nWatch the latest video at foxnews.com", "description": "Boom..09/22/2019 12:27:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/121/d2550755-e23e-4344-89be-7126bf5f16da.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
