It centred around using NRA links to influence the Republican Party's foreign policy and their traditionally hostile stance toward Russia.\n\nEarlier this year Republicans in the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) blocked further investigation of Mr Torshin and alleged illegal funding to the NRA from Russians, prompting criticism.\n\nButina initially pleaded not guilty to the charge against her, but later admitted her guilt as part of a plea deal in December 2018.\n\nAlthough unnamed in the plea deal, Mr Torshin was clearly the unnamed Russian official she admitted to working with to pursue backdoor channels of communication to American conservatives who could influence US politics. He has never been charged.\n\nDuring her sentencing hearing, Butina expressed regret at her actions, telling the court: \"I destroyed my own life.\"\n\nDespite the prosecutor's claims that she had damaged US national security, Butina maintained she had no intention of harming the American people.\n\nVladimir Putin described her jailing as an \"outrage\", and the Russian embassy in the US said on Thursday: \"We really hope that the hardest phase of the Russian woman's life will end... we want her to be reunited with her nearest and dearest as soon as possible.\"", "description": "The 30-year-old pro-gun activist was greeted by her father, and journalists who gave her flowers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/33AF/production/_109413231_mediaitem109413228.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
