One play later, McCleskey made a catch in traffic over the middle, broke a tackle and raced to the end zone.\n\nHouston returned the ensuing kickoff 51 yards, but time expired.\n\nMcCleskey finished with four catches for 120 yards and two scores for Tulane (3-1, 1-0 American Athletic Conference), which trailed 28-7 in the second quarter. Justin McMillan completed 7 of 20 passes for 186 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nD\u2019Eriq King threw for 229 yards and two scores, and ran for 116 yards and a TD for Houston (1-3, 0-1). King broke former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow\u2019s FBS record for the most consecutive games (15) with at least one passing and rushing touchdown.\n\nIt was the 21st straight game the Houston defense recorded a turnover, the longest active streak in the country.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jalen McCleskey scored on a 53-yard catch-and-run with 3 seconds left, and Tulane rallied from a 21-point deficit to beat Houston 38-31 on Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/houston_tulane_football_25688_c0-112-2681-1675_s1770x1032.jpg?fba616ffeabf9d37d35ae7ad97e85c9329f9140e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
