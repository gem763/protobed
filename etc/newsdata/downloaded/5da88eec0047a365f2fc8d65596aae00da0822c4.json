A few security guards manning an entrance insisted that work was going on, yet no activity was visible from the outside.\n\nThe developer, Beijing-based Oceanwide Holdings Co., offered few details on the future of the $1 billion-plus project -- other than to insist that it has financing and work is continuing. The lawsuits by unpaid subcontractors, on the other hand, give a glimpse of the developer\u2019s struggle to come up with needed money to finish the project.\n\nAs a trade war between the U.S. and China approaches its second anniversary in January, Beijing is making it tougher to shift money abroad, having imposed capital controls last year to help stabilize its currency. Those restrictions have meant that Chinese direct investment in the U.S. real estate and hospitality sectors plummeted to $377 million last year from a high of $17.3 billion in 2016, according to data from Rhodium Group LLC.\n\n\u201cIt appears they wanted to self-fund the entire project,\u201d Dale Ortmann, an attorney representing two of the Oceanwide subcontractors, said of the China-based company. \u201cNow, with the changes in Chinese government policy, the owner is trying to find a traditional construction loan while in the middle of construction.\u201d\n\nSubcontractor Claims\n\nAnd that\u2019s tough. Under California law, all subcontractors\u2019 claims over unpaid invoices, no matter when they performed work on the project, will have priority over any liens a subsequent lender may have, according to Adam Salis, a lawyer in Mission Viejo, California, who specializes in real estate. That\u2019s why construction lenders usually will only get involved before work has started on a project.\n\nWith economic growth slowing last year, China tightened restrictions on capital outflows after Chinese companies had gone on a years-long global buying and building spree. Over-leveraged conglomerates such as Dalian Wanda Group Co. and Anbang Insurance Group Co. were forced to liquidate overseas real-estate worth billions of dollars, and developers were no longer able to finance their projects abroad with money from home.\n\n\u201cThe capital outflow control has been strictly enforced by the Chinese government so far this year due to the intensifying U.S.-China trade war,\u201d said Patrick Wong, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst based in Hong Kong.\n\nOceanwide Plaza is part of a building boom that has been transforming downtown Los Angeles in recent years. Whereas for decades the city\u2019s historic core had been a ghost town at night -- home to mostly destitute transients and a few artists and urban pioneers, the 21st Century has brought in an influx of young professionals seeking an alternative to the suburban, car-dependent Southern California lifestyle.\n\nThe number of market-rate apartments has increased by more than 10-fold, from 2,426 before 1999 to 27,616 as of the second quarter of this year, with another 3,296 under construction, according to data from the Downtown Center Business Improvement District. The number of condos during this period rose from 829 to 6,760, with 1,839 under construction.\n\nIn the South Park area of downtown, around the Staples Center, developers including Philip Anschutz\u2019s AEG, Shanghai-based Greenland Holding Group Co. and Hankey Investment Co. have gone to town to transform the skyline with gleaming towers -- hotels, luxury condominiums and apartments.\n\nOceanwide Plaza\u2019s contribution to this new hub of high-end living is to include the first Park Hyatt on the West Coast. The project\u2019s tallest tower at 604 feet is to include the 184-room hotel and 164 hotel-serviced residences. Two adjacent towers hold another 340 condominiums.\n\nThe development is also to feature a 700-foot LED ribbon wrapping around the building, 153,000 square foot of retail space and a two-acre sky park.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s meant to be one of the crown jewels of downtown Los Angeles\u2019 urban renaissance but now it\u2019s in limbo -- plagued by lawsuits from subcontractors, and victim of an ongoing trade dispute between China and the U.S. and a Beijing crackdown on credit and capital flight.Construction has", "authors": ["Edvard Pettersson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/g9WFGZBmBAqQe1acsGNM.w--~B/aD0xMjk2O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/a1cfa093b50d3076b8bb6746f9dcec16", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
