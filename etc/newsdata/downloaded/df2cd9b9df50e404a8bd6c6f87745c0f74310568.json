His accessory? A severed head.\n\nThe decapitated head was made of silicone and polyurethane resins with skulls 3D-scanned using green screen technology to create the life-sized, identical sculpture. It took roughly six months to make the masterpiece that is Jared Leto's face.\n\nThe 30 Seconds to Mars singer recently revealed though, that he'd lost his head \u2013 literally.\n\nSpeaking to GQ, the 47-year-old said he didn't know where his severed head was.\n\n\"Honestly, I have no idea,\" he said.\n\n\"I think someone may have stolen it. If anyone out there finds it, bring it into your nearest Gucci store in exchange for a pair of dirty sneakers.\"\n\nWe don't know what kind of person would steal Jared Leto's head, but please return it \u2013 safely \u2013 to its rightful owner.\n\nCompiled by Bashiera Parker (Sources: Channel24, GQ)", "description": "Jared Leto recently revealed that he's lost his head \u2013 literally.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7235/226288ca2e914faca6cc66cdad96b620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
