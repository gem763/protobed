It's the uncertainty being prolonged,\" de Montchalin told French radio station RMC. She said such uncertainty leads to recession and a lack of confidence in politics.\n\nDe Montchalin said the EU needs a clear answer from the U.K. parliament before October 31 on whether it accepts or rejects the latest Brexit deal.\n\nOn Saturday, British MPs backed an amendment that compelled Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit until all the legislation required to leave has been ratified. European Council President Donald Tusk is now consulting EU leaders over Johnson's request.\n\nDe Montchalin said France would could not consider supporting a delay beyond the current Brexit date of October 31 without clarity from the U.K. over what would be done with the extra time.\n\n\"No new delay without conditions or justification,\" de Montchalin said.\n\n\"There are some people who say we need six months. But six months for what?\" de Montchalin asked. \"If there's going to be elections or a new referendum, we can discuss that. But six months to say to Boris Johnson: 'Your majority isn't following you but we'll give you time because, you never know, a miracle could happen?' That won't work.\"\n\nDe Montchalin said the EU could not be \"forced into immobilism\" by \"British political games.\"", "description": "EU should not grant delay unless UK presents clear plan, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin says.", "authors": ["Louise Guillot", "David M.
