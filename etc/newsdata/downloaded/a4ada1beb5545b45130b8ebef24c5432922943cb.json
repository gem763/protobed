AAP\n\nIt is the romance of the lost cause. Very few sports clubs in any code anywhere will have turned up to a football final with so much to prove as the Richmond Tigers and Greater Western Sydney Giants when they take to the Melbourne Cricket Ground at 2.30pm tomorrow. The brash new Giants are just six years old, but frequently derided as a manufactured club and marketing experiment to plant AFL in the hostile soil of rugby league\u2019s western Sydney heartland. Richmond is Melbourne old school, founded in 1885, but burdened with too much of the wrong history. They were premiers in 2017, but before that it was 35 years since they even reached a grand final.\n\nBoth teams have been the butt of jokes for very different reasons. The Giants are part of the sports wars and battle for eyeballs, heavily subsidised by the AFL to introduce the world\u2019s oldest codified football game among some of the newest Australians in multicultural western Sydney. The new boys have had to weather sparse crowds and indifference at home and hostility away. Richmond president Peggy O'Neal, the only woman in that role in AFL, has had to take her share of Monday morning ribbing.\n\nBut the striking thing about AFL is its classlessness and indifference to background, unlike the working class and private school divisions of rugby, and the multiple tribalisms of English football. It is the results that count. Giants president Tony Shepherd says that his side have done it tough, but winning will convince Sydneysiders to adopt them. Ms O\u2019Neal reckons Richmond deserve another famous win. On history alone it is a fascinating match-up.", "description": "The AFL grand final on the weekend will be a fascinating match-up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.493%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_286%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/711be133b52c0347ae25ff53f751f3b67bf24d50", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
