Have an Affair.\"\n\n\"People have tried to put cheating in categories, but I think there are different kinds and different needs and reasons for cheating,\" Nelson said.\n\nRead more: MTV's 'Ghosted' helps people confront friends and lovers who ditched them without warning. A therapist says it 'opens the door for cruelty.'\n\nMore specifically, there are people who cheat because it's part of who they are and people who cheat because of circumstances in their lives that may have driven them to do so.\n\nSerial cheaters' personalities drive them to cheat time and time again\n\nNot every cheater is a self-centered or bad person. PeopleImages/Getty Images\n\nSerial cheaters do exist, but they tend to do so for reasons that have more to do with their personalities than their circumstances.\n\n\"Maybe they're turned on by dishonesty,\" Nelson said. \"[They have an] inability to commit to monogamy but are also not honest enough to ask for an open relationship.\"\n\nSome serial cheaters may be driven in part by their own shortcomings in the bedroom.\n\nOne 2011 study found that men with performance anxiety in the bedroom were more likely to cheat than those with no performance problems, perhaps because the cheaters needed a greater level of excitement (in the form of an affair) in order to perform. Having sex with someone you don't know well could also lower the stakes of being unable to perform, the researchers said.\n\nNelson said serial cheaters may also have an attachment disorder or narcissism. Narcissists are characterized as selfish yet charming, so while it may seem they have your best interests at heart, they're likely just thinking about themselves. An affair may seem like no big deal to a narcissist.\n\n\"Their need for attention and admiration is never-ending,\" clinical psychologist Candace V. Love told Business Insider.\n\nWhen it comes to those with attachment disorders, Nelson said these people view their partners almost like parental figures, an outlook that usually stems from childhood experiences.\n\n\"[The cheater] makes it seems like they need a safe home base with a partner but then acts like an adolescent saying 'You can't tell me what to do' and 'I'm going to do what I want,' instead of just being single and clear about their values,\" Nelson said.\n\nThe cheater may even believe they are doing themselves and their partner a favor by staying in a relationship but cheating on the side.\n\nNot all cheaters are destined to have more than one affair\n\nPeople have affairs for all kinds of reasons.

Even though it's generally not the best option, cheating can act as a coping mechanism for someone who doesn't know how to deal with relationships problems, stress, or feelings of inadequacy.\n\nAs a result, they may cheat and later realize their behavior wasn't the best option. If someone is able to figure this out, wants to be better in the future, and is willing to put in the work \u2014 both in therapy and on their own \u2014 it's a sign they don't actually want to cheat and likely didn't want to to begin with. It's a lesson learned in what not to do, according to Nelson.\n\nFactors like where a person is in their life, how they feel in a specific relationship, or how they feel about themselves at any given moment can also influence cheating motivations, Nelson said.\n\nA person may cheat, for example, if they are lacking self-confidence; getting attention from a person outside their relationship can make them feel important and desirable. A cheater may also have an affair out of resentment for their partner, according to Nelson.\n\nBut those circumstances aren't constant, so the idea that any person who has cheated will definitely do so again in the future doesn't necessarily hold true.\n\nIf you or your partner has had an affair, you'll need to have an honest conversation about how your relationship needs to evolve, Nelson said.\n\nShe said couples need to renegotiate the terms of their partnership after an affair, whether that means one person needs more emotional or sexual attention, or more support in a certain area, like work or taking care of the kids.\n\nOnly then can a couple rebound and start their marriage over, in a sense.\n\n\"If you are going to wake up and change your relationship and [yourself], it could be an incredible moment,\" Nelson said.", "description": "The stereotypical cheater is a person who will have affairs over and over again, but not all cheaters have this mindset.", "authors": ["Julia Naftulin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d922b0f2e22af47fa255769?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
