Toi Hutchinson, a Democrat recently tabbed to lead the state\u2019s recreational marijuana program, said that retail sales will begin with the new year.\n\n\u201cThere may be pitfalls, and we\u2019ll deal with them as they come,\u201d Ms. Hutchinson said in an interview, Chicago Business reported. \u201cThe sky is not falling. We will be open for business in multiple locations around the state Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cWill there be challenges and pitfalls? Absolutely. But we\u2019ll be ready on Jan. 1,\u201d she said.\n\nGov. J.B.
