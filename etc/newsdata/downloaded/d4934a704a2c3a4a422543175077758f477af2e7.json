Thank you, @SpeakerPelosi and de facto Speaker @AOC!\" the NRCC tweeted, referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. who has long called for impeachment.\n\nPELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP\n\nThe news was the latest indication that Trump experienced strong support from the party even as Democrats ramped up investigations into his administration. It was also the latest, massive fundraising haul that Republicans reported since Trump announced his re-election bid in June.\n\nDonors seemed to respond to a concerted effort by the Trump team to campaign off of Pelosi's decision. Shortly after her Tuesday announcement, Trump tweeted a campaign video accusing Democrats of an obsessive focus on fighting him.\n\nThe campaign also leveraged the White House's decision to release a transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. News of that conversation ignited Democratic concerns that the president tried to pressure a foreign government into interfering in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a fundraising email on Wednesday, Trump claimed the latest Democratic attack was \"just another smear job\" and a \"pathetic attempt by Democrats to rip the power from the people.\"\n\nThe transcript did not show any explicit quid pro quo offer involving foreign aid to Ukraine. It did, however, show the leaders discussing Biden and raised Democratic concerns that Trump inappropriately pressured his Ukrainian counterpart.", "description": "The Trump campaign announced it, in combination with the Republican Party,\u00a0raked in $5 million in donations in the 24 hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced she would pursue formal impeachment proceedings against the president.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
