When a woman is pregnant and about to deliver a baby you can't turn her away from the hospital and say you are a foreign national \u2026 you can't.\"\n\nMotsoaledi continued: \"And when they deliver a premature baby, you have got to keep them in hospital.\n\n\"When more and more come, you can't say the hospital is full now go away \u2026 they have to be admitted, we have got no option - and when they get admitted in large numbers, they cause overcrowding, infection control starts failing.\"\n\nDespite this, the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health says contrary to popular belief, immigrants are not a huge burden on health care.\n\nIn terms of immigrants being carriers of disease, the report is emphatic: \"Suspicion against migrants as carriers of disease is probably the most pervasive and powerful myth related to migration and health throughout history.\"\n\nNews24 previously reported that migrants and asylum seekers would have access to Gauteng's hospitals when the National Health Insurance (NHI) is implemented.\n\n\"Migrant access to health care will not be affected in any way, the Constitution guarantees anyone access to health care.\"The NHI fund guarantees that registered migrants, asylum seekers, etc. - you will still have access,\" Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku told News24.", "description": "Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says the demand for health services in South Africa is increasing and funds to address the change are limited mainly due to the continuous rise of immigration and the increasing burden of disease.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8934/568a96727bc74a4b8d58bb9e85d414d4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
