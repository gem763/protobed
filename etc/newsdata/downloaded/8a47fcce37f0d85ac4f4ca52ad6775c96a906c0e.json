From an operational and risk perspective, we've handled the inflows smoothly and without comprising our credit underwriting standards.\"\n\nThe bank is also building \"next generation\" electronic trading platforms and a new corporate cash management business, he said.\n\n\n\n\"Taken together, these investments draw on our returns in the short term, but are critical to expanding our capabilities and our competitive position,\" Solomon said.", "description": "David Solomon provided investors with an update on the bank's new initiatives at the start of a conference call Tuesday.", "authors": ["Hugh Son"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105875560-1556302395067gettyimages-1132776582.jpeg?v=1556313097", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
