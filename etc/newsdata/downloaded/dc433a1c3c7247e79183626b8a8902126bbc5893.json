But when I look back now, I realise I was in the wrong.\n\nTheir criticism was nothing personal. I was not playing as well as I should have, and Xhaka needs to accept that, too. His performances at Arsenal have been below par.\n\nHe is supposed to be the club's captain. He cannot bury his head in the sand, or pretend this situation is not his own fault.\n\nGranit Xhaka was jeered off the pitch as Arsenal searched for a winner against Crystal Palace\n\nArsenal fans have seen some marvellous midfielders play for their club, from Patrick Vieira to Cesc Fabregas to Robert Pires.\n\nThey are educated in that department, and Xhaka has not performed well enough for their liking.\n\nI believe in football, there is always a way back. But Xhaka has serious work to do.\n\nWhat he needs to do first is acknowledge his own shortcomings, rather than blame others.", "description": "JAMIE REDKNAPP - MY VERDICT: There were times when I got stick off my own fans and, like Granit Xhaka, I responded by telling them to 'f*** off'.", "authors": ["Jamie Redknapp For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/21/20253498-0-image-a-54_1572211391247.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
