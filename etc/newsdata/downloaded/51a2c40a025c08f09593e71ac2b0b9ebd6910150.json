This is very wrong but he is very plausible. He conducted her funeral and is even mentioned in the will. We could just not believe it.'\n\nMorris, 62, the vicar of Bestwood, in Nottingham, pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position.\n\nSentencing Morris \u2013 whose wife was a Labour councillor until May and a former Lord Mayor of Nottingham \u2013 Judge Steven Coupland said the vicar was guilty of a 'gross betrayal of trust'.\n\nJoan Pennack (pictured) - known as Mavis - had given Morris a bank card with access to her account, the court heard\n\nThe judge added: 'The bible makes it plain taking money from others is to be regarded as a sin. You have brought considerable shame on your church.'\n\nMorris, 62, (pictured) the vicar of Bestwood, in Nottingham, pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position and was jailed for 10 months\n\nDigby Johnson, defending, said Morris realised what he had done was 'profoundly wrong', adding: 'It is not the case that he is in need of money. It looks as though it was spent on fripperies. Over the years he has been an obsessive book collector.'\n\nMr Johnson said at the time of the offence, Morris and his wife were the targets of a 'campaign' that saw the church and their car attacked by arsonists.\n\nHe claimed someone scrawled 'You next' on the vicarage after one incident, and that Morris's wife was attacked by a man armed with a pickaxe handle.\n\nThe court also heard she had suffered from health problems since an operation went wrong in 2013 and Morris was 'central' to her care.\n\nLucky Thandi, prosecuting, told the court Morris made the cash withdrawals in December 2016 and early January 2017.\n\nWheelchair-bound Mrs Pennack died on January 9, 2017. 'Her stepdaughter, Sheila Smith, wasn't informed of her death until January 25, when this defendant called her,' the prosecutor said.\n\nMrs Smith was a beneficiary of Mrs Pennack's will, along with another stepdaughter, and Morris was named as executor.\n\nMorris, who has since resigned from his post, had a 1983 shoplifting conviction, and had also been cautioned by police in 2000 after taking money from a safe.", "description": "Reverend Edward Morris, from Nottingham, spent the money on 'books and fripperies' after widower Joan Pennack made him a signatory on her bank account when she went into care home.", "authors": ["Andy Dolan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/21/20055180-0-image-a-81_1571777660724.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
