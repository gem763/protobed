Like so many others brought to golf, she found that the greatest appeal was the individual test to get better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m goal-oriented,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to prove to myself how far I can go on my own.\u201d\n\nHow far she can go?\n\nIt\u2019s how far Kayli already has come that makes her appearance in the Pure Insurance Championship so amazing.\n\nHer mother calls the trip to Pebble Beach a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime deal.\u201d Kayli was among 78 participants from The First Tee chapters around the country who were selected to compete alongside PGA Tour Champions players like Bernhard Langer and Mark O\u2019Meara, Vijay Singh and Davis Love III.\n\nBut then, everything about Kayli is once in a lifetime.\n\nFor starters, she doesn\u2019t know exactly where she was born, or even when. She was an infant when she was found outside an equipment factory in Nanjing, China, and taken in as an orphan. That\u2019s about the time Lisa Lucas showed up as part of a 20-month process to adopt a baby girl.\n\nThe orphanage sent her a picture, and Lucas could see in the baby\u2019s eyes something was not quite right. No matter. She wanted her. When they arrived in Nanjing and switched the girl out of her clothes, her entire body was covered with scabies, which had led to a staph infection. Lucas said the baby was rushed to a hospital.\n\n\u201cThey said two weeks longer and I would not have had my child,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cShe\u2019s a miracle all the way around. She was about 9 months when we got her and from lack of human touch, she could barely hold her head up. Two weeks before we left, she was sitting up on her own.\u201d\n\nHer muscles were underdeveloped. She had a bald spot in the back of her head through elementary school.\n\nKayli knows her story now.\n\nHer mother waited until she was old enough to understand that she was born in China and was very sick, that they have no idea about her birth parents and never will. The orphanage had a rough idea of Kayli\u2019s age when they found her, so Lucas chose Oct. 14 as her birthdate for the official record.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not brought up in an Asian-oriented household. I don\u2019t necessarily think about it,\u201d Kayli said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully understood it until five years ago. I never Googled the city where I was found, or born, until a school project. We had to do an autobiography.\u201d\n\nHers, no doubt, was different from her classmates.\n\nLucas remarried and moved to Gallatin, about 30 miles northeast of Nashville. She wanted her daughter to be more active, whether that was gymnastics or something else. Her friend invited her to The First Tee, and Kayli asked her stepfather, Greg Borchers, to at least show how her how to swing a club before her first lesson.\n\nShe was hooked.\n\nJosh McCade, the executive director of The First Tee of Tennessee, could tell she was different. Sure, he heard enough conversations over the years to piece together Kayli\u2019s story. What he saw was someone who made the most of opportunities, and golf was no different.\n\n\u201cShe had this eagerness to learn the game of golf,\u201d McCade said. \u201cThat was something you could tell. After class, she\u2019d be hitting balls on the range, putting and chipping on her own. You can separate kids from who\u2019s there because they want to be there. She has a great spirit about herself.\u201d\n\nKayli says Borchers has invested the most time in her game, how to treat the course and manage her game. The teachers at The First Tee and Gallatin High have honed her swing. \u201cWithout them, my swing would be a hot mess,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nShe plays on the high school team. Her best score - not in competition - is 2-over par for 18 holes. She is looking into colleges in the Midwest for next year and deciding how much she wants golf to be part of it.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s a trip to Pebble.\n\nKayli was in Los Angeles last month for the CoBank Peak Performers , one of nine First Tee participants who spent a day with six-time major champion Nick Faldo at Trump National along the Pacific. \u201cI was super nervous and did not hit the ball well,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nShe has not yet found out her partner for the Pure Insurance Championship.\n\nHer mother has never been to California, and she\u2019ll be in the beauty of the Monterey Peninsula watching a girl she first saw as an infant in an orphanage in China, with no guarantees where it all would lead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so thankful to have her,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI know people say I\u2019m a blessing to her life. But she\u2019s blessing to mine.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kayli Lucas is headed to Pebble Beach to play in a PGA Tour Champions event, a dream week for a 17-year-old girl from Tennessee who knew nothing about golf until a friend from church invited her out for a lesson at The First Tee.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Ferguson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/on_the_fringe_golf_28668_c0-1232-2688-2799_s1770x1032.jpg?1af6fa800dbf6e9a5c00483b0c3f774d72134026", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
