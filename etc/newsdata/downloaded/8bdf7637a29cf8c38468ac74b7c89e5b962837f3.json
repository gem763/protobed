However, regardless of where the storm's center makes landfall \u2014 or whether it does at all \u2014 it's likely that most of the South-East will feel effects from the storm.\n\nAir travel is expected to be impacted, though as in many cases of severe weather, effects could ripple across the US as aircraft are repositioned or delayed because of the storm.\n\nAmerican, Alaska, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and United have issued travel waivers, allowing people with flights that may be directly affected to change their itineraries without a fee.\n\nThose waivers initially applied mostly to airports in Florida and the Caribbean. As the storm's projected path shifts, it is likely that airlines will add additional waivers.\n\nMultiple airlines also announced it would waive pet-in-cabin and baggage fees on flights from certain airports in order to help with evacuations.\n\nOn Friday afternoon Orlando Airport became the first airport to announce a closure, saying it would cease operations Monday at 2 a.m. \u2014 however, it rescinded that on Saturday afternoon, saying it planned to maintain services.\n\nScroll down for full details, and keep checking this article \u2014 we'll be updating it as necessary.\n\nIf you're traveling this weekend, check this page for updated travel waiver information.", "description": "With Hurricane Dorian bearing down on the Bahamas on Sunday and its eventual track to the US uncertain, here's what you need to know about flights.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d66ea192e22af1f7a52bca3-2732-1366.jpg"}
