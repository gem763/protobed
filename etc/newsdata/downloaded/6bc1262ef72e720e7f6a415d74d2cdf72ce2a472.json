That represented less than 3% of total global vehicle sales, according to Reuters calculations based on data from researcher IHS Automotive.\n\nHe said the value of the global battery industry was expected to exceed that of the semiconductor market by 2025.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Mark Potter)", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Chem, one of the leading electric vehicle (EV) battery makers, expects global sales of EVs to grow more than five-fold from 2018 levels to account for about 15% of global vehicle sales in 2024, it said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Hyunjoo Jin"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
