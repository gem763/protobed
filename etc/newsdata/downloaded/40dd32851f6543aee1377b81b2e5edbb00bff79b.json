Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church.\n\n\u201cI believe that Korea and Japan share a common ancestry,\u201d Mrs. Moon said, adding that all Pacific rim nations should \u201cunite as one for the sake of peace.\u201d\n\nShe also said leaders of all nations should begin each day with prayer.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the huge gathering and a joint leadership conference were taking place \u201cat a particularly delicate time\u201d in northeast Asia.\n\n\u201cThe worldwide movement you represent truly is one of the great hopes for the future of freedom and world peace,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us have a great deal at stake.\u201d\n\nTensions between Seoul and Tokyo are running high, and North Korea said Saturday it was breaking off the latest round of denuclearization talks with the U.S., accusing the Trump administration of offering no new proposals. U.S. officials said negotiations had not broken down.\n\nMuch of the four-hour convocation highlighted music and dance performances by Japanese and Korean students pledging to bring the two nations closer together. Several religious leaders also offered prayers for peace.\n\nMrs. Moon arrived in the expo center being driven in a flower-adorned electric cart, to thunderous cheers from audience members who waved small Japanese and South Korean flags. Preceding her arrival was a wedding blessing ceremony for hundreds of couples.\n\nMrs. Moon has led the Unification movement since a few years before the 2012 death of the Rev. Moon, whose ministry grew to include affiliated commercial operations and media properties including The Washington Times.\n\nAlso participating in the event were Republican Reps. Ted Yoho of Florida and Andy Biggs of Arizona.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
