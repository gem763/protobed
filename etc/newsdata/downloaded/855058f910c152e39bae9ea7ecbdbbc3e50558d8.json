Historically, it turns out, markets have initially performed much better in the wake of a Liberal minority victory than the Conservative equivalent.\n\nPrior to Monday\u2019s result, Canada had elected 10 minority governments since 1935 \u2014 five were run by the Liberals and five by the Conservatives. According to BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski, Canadian markets rallied, on average, six per cent in the first six months and 13.5 per cent over the first 12 months of a Liberal minority.\n\nBy comparison, the TSX struggled out of the gate under the five past Conservative minority governments, losing an average of 2.2 per cent in the six months following the election.\n\n\u201cWhy do you have an initial bump in the Liberal side of the things?,\u201d Belski asked. \u201cWell, if you think about it, especially if there\u2019s a change from Conservatives, Liberals are much more stimulative because they spend more money.\u201d\n\nThat rally has almost always immediately begun to fade in the second year of a Liberal minority government\u2019s reign. By the time those governments fall, the average annualized performance of the markets sits at 6.5 per cent, according to Belski. Conservative minority governments start slowly, but have seen average gains of 9.8 per cent in annualized performance.\n\nWhile past performance suggests the market could see a bump, Belski doesn\u2019t recommend that investors make changes from the status quo. \u201cMost investors are positioned for gridlock and gridlock is good,\u201d he said.\n\nLiberals are much more stimulative because they spend more money. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThe election result was better than the one Ninepoint Partners portfolio manager Eric Nuttall had feared, but he\u2019s not in favour of immediate alterations either.\n\nThe energy file has caused division among Canadian voters, but in absence of a Conservative majority, a Liberal minority was the best option for investors, Nuttall said. A Conservative minority could have seen the Liberals form a coalition with the NDP to take power, he added, which would have put the Trans Mountain pipeline\u2019s immediate future in doubt.\n\n\u201cThe Liberals could\u2019ve used an NDP coalition to abdicate their prior moral authority on the project,\u201d Nuttall said, highlighting how strange an experience it was to be cheering for a Liberal minority. \u201cI think today with a strong Liberal minority not relying on NDP votes, they would have the support of the Conservatives in getting the project through.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the pipeline that the Liberal government bought for $4.5 billion has begun but could be sent back to Cabinet if the Court of Appeal rules in favour of the six Indigenous groups challenging its approval.\n\nIn the current arrangement, the Liberals would likely look to the other parties for support on a case-by-case basis. While the NDP and Greens can prop up the Liberals in legislation centred around climate change, the Conservatives would likely form an uneasy alliance with Trudeau to see the pipeline project through.\n\nA Liberal minority government may have the ability to advance the interests of energy investors, but constructing Trans Mountain would likely take around 30 months, Nuttall said, meaning a catalyst for the sector might still be hard to come by.\n\n\u201cGiven how skeptical people are I think you have to wait for oil to actually start flowing through,\u201d Nuttall said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the first scoop of dirt is going to shift sentiment.\u201d", "description": "Markets have historically been more positive than with Conservative minorities", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canadidates.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
