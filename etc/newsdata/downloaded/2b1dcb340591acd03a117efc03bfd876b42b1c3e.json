It\u2019s the same thing that has made me successful is that when people look at me, they see a fighter, somebody who takes on the establishment, who isn\u2019t intimidated, and is willing to kick through doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is more of a Ted Cruz state than it is a Donald Trump state,\u201d said Hegar. Which is why she believes she can win.\n\nCentral to Hegar\u2019s political identity is her military service, which includes three tours in Afghanistan. On the last of those tours, she piloted a helicopter that was shot down by the Taliban. Hegar herself was shot in the process. In the ensuing rescue mission, her actions saved the lives of her crew and earned her the Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor. The door from that helicopter now hangs on a wall in her house \u2014 and was featured in a viral ad during her 2018 congressional campaign.\n\nThat race, which Hegar lost by less than three percentage points, saw her try to flip a heavily Republican seat in the suburbs of Austin \u2014 a district \u201cgerrymandered to be much redder than the rest of the state, so it was really like a giant focus group for running a statewide campaign,\u201d said Hegar. \u201cIf you adjust for the gerrymandering, we would have won that race if it was a mini Texas.\u201d\n\nThe candidate recalls driving through the northern part of her district and seeing houses boasting yard signs supporting both her and Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cI would be like, \u2018Stop the car,\u2019 and go find out what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I would knock on the door, and they would say, \u2018We don\u2019t care. We don\u2019t care what your policy positions are. We just want a fighter. We know you guys will disagree and you\u2019ll fight against each other sometimes, but you\u2019ll be fighting for us.\u2019\u201d\n\nHegar says that Cornyn doesn\u2019t enjoy that sort of reputation.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always just in kind of coast mode, and self-preservation, and just not leading and taking any risks. And you know, that\u2019s not something that people would normally say about Ted Cruz, although I disagree with what Ted Cruz thinks is right for this state,\u201d she said. \u201cTexans and independent voters like to vote for somebody who is going to buck the status quo, and isn\u2019t going to do as he is told.\u201d\n\nCase in point: the looming impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump.\n\nCornyn is \u201cfull-on in support of the president without seeing any evidence and any result of investigation,\u201d said Hegar. \u201cAnd that concerns me regardless of what your party is.\u201d\n\nHegar, who supports the investigation, said she is \u201cequally\u201d troubled by \u201canybody who\u2019s going to reflex to, \u2018We absolutely need to impeach.\u2019 You know, not just the investigation, but actually voting [Trump] out of office because they don\u2019t like his policies. I don\u2019t like his policies, but I would like to see him lose an election because his policies aren\u2019t working for working families in Texas.\u201d\n\nFamously, Democrats have not won a statewide office in Texas in a quarter-century, through election cycle after cycle of pundits chattering about the seeming inevitability of the ruby-red Republican crown jewel, turning blue. O\u2019Rourke came close in 2018, losing to Cruz by three points.\n\nFor her part, Hegar is undaunted.\n\n\u201cHaving a path to elected office was never the goal for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a medevac pilot. I have spent time suppressing wildfires and things like that. And as a combat pilot, I tend to find the biggest bucket of water I can find and put it on the biggest fire I can find, right?\u201d\n\nTo hear more from MJ Hegar, listen to the full podcast here.
