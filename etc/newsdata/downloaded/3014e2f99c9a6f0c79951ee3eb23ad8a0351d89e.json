It just \u2013 it\u2019s not fair to any of the team.\" Mike Pompeo said. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nIS THAT A MEA CULPA? \u2026 SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO spoke to the The Sunflower, the student paper at Wichita State: QUESTION: \u201cThank you. Bill Taylor, a fellow West Point grad who\u2019s served in every administration since 1985 \u2013 both parties \u2013 testified before the House. The White House line characterized it \u2013 he and others as \u2018radical unelected bureaucrats.\u2019 I think you responded briefly to that yesterday, but I\u2019m curious: Do you still have confidence in your top Ukrainian diplomat?\u201d\n\nPOMPEO: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about personnel stuff. It just \u2013 it\u2019s not fair to any of the team. But I\u2019ll say this: I have a responsibility leading this big organization. I\u2019ve watched Bill. He and I have talked about Ukrainian policy at some length: how do you take down corruption; how do you now help the new leader there, President Zelensky; how do we deliver on America\u2019s national security interests. And he and I were in full accord on that. We \u2013 he and I both share in this vision for how American interests in Ukraine can properly be represented, and I have every reason to think that he\u2019s still out there banging away at that problem set.\n\n\u201cBut I will say this: We all, as human beings, can get it wrong, too. We see things through a certain prism; we address things in a certain way. We all have a responsibility to make sure we\u2019re getting it as right as we can each and every day. And so I don\u2019t think by nature of the fact that I work at the State Department means I get everything right every day.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s true for all the people who work at the United States Department of State. Indeed, I have seen State Department officials engage in behavior that was not appropriate, that wasn\u2019t right, that didn\u2019t reflect the highest values of the Foreign Service and American diplomacy around the world. And so my obligation as the organization\u2019s leader is to sort through that, to parse through it, to make sure that we collectively are delivering on behalf of the American people each and every day.\u201d\n\nTHE SCOTSMAN: \u201cTrumps \u2018frustrated\u2019 at inability to pursue \u2018foreign investment\u2019 deals, says Trump Org executive,\u201d by Martyn McLaughlin: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s most senior executive in the UK has said the Trump family is feeling frustrated at being unable to pursue \u2018foreign investments\u2019 and overseas business opportunities, while also revealing that \u2018everybody in the Trump Organisation is going to write a book.\u2019\n\n\u201cSarah Malone, executive vice president of Trump International Scotland, suggested that since assuming the presidency, Mr Trump\u2019s personal \u201cliberties and freedoms\u201d have been curtailed because he cannot visit his Scottish properties to play golf as and when he pleases.\u201d The Scotsman\n\nGREAT READ \u2026 NYT\u2019S MARK LEIBOVICH: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Gift to Mitt Romney: Relevance\u201d: \u201c\u2018The best personnel decision he made was not choosing me,\u2019 Mr. Romney said. \u2018I would not have lasted as long as Rex Tillerson,\u2019 he added of the eventual choice \u2018and maybe a little longer than Anthony Scaramucci did,\u2019 referring to the White House communications director who lasted less than two weeks in the job.\u201d NYT\n\nA message from Google: More than 60 percent of people searching for addiction treatment used the web to find help.

Their return is a late acknowledgment, some White House advisers say, that the facts coming out are bad for the president and that both his White House and personal attorneys need to try to get in front of what else may emerge.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- KYLE CHENEY: \u201cFormer Bolton aide asks court if he's required to testify in impeachment probe\u201d: \u201cA top aide to former national security adviser John Bolton filed suit Friday to determine whether he's required to comply with a subpoena to appear before House impeachment investigators, a move that could mire the testimony of a key witness in litigation as President Donald Trump seeks to block his cooperation with lawmakers.\n\n\u201cCharles Kupperman, the former deputy national security adviser \u2014 who briefly succeeded Bolton after he left the administration last month \u2014 is asking a district court judge to decide how to resolve the conflict between the House subpoena and the president's directive.\n\n\u201cIn a Friday letter to Kupperman's attorney Chuck Cooper, who is also representing Bolton, White House counsel Pat Cipollone indicated that Trump had directed him not to honor the House subpoena and asserted that Kupperman is \u2018absolutely immune\u2019 from testifying because of his regular interactions with Trump.\n\n\u201c\u2018Absent a definitive judgment from the Judicial Branch ... Plaintiff will effectively be forced to adjudicate the Constitutional dispute himself, and if he judges wrongly, he will inflict grave Constitutional injury on either the House or the President,\u2019 Cooper wrote in a court filing.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- WHAT JARED IS READING \u201cTrump says impeachment has given him experience with broken criminal justice system,\u201d by Daniel Lippman in Columbia, S.C. and Caitlin Oprysko\n\nDAILY RUDY \u2026 FINKEL IS EINHORN, EINHORN IS FINKEL \u2026 NYT\u2019S KEN VOGEL: \u201cGiuliani Is Drawing Attention to Hunter Biden\u2019s Work in Romania. But There\u2019s a Problem.\u201d: \u201cRudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, signaled this month that he planned to open a new front in his attacks against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 work done by Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden for a wealthy Romanian business executive facing corruption charges.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a problem with that strategy: Mr. Giuliani participated in an effort that would have helped the same executive, and was in fact recruited to do so by Louis J. Freeh, a former F.B.I. director who had been brought onto the matter by Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cIn effect, Mr. Giuliani and Hunter Biden were on the same team, if not at the same time. And their work to help the business executive, along with that of Mr. Freeh, stood in contrast to efforts by the United States, including Vice President Biden while he was in office, to encourage anti-corruption efforts in Romania.\u201d NYT\n\n-- NBC: \u201cRudy Giuliani butt-dials NBC reporter, heard discussing need for cash and trashing Bidens,\u201d by Rich Shapiro\n\nA message from Google: Searches on Google for \u201cdrug drop off near me\u201d or \u201cmedication disposal near me\u201d now show permanent drop-off locations near you on Google Maps.\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026\n\n-- AJC: \u201cDemocratic presidential debate sidesteps suburbs for star\u2019s Atlanta studio,\u201d by Jim Galloway and Greg Bluestein: \u201cThe Democratic presidential debate will be held next month at Tyler Perry Studios, according to several party officials, sidestepping the suburbs for the newly opened $250 million complex near Atlanta\u2019s airport.\n\n\u201cThe studio was selected for the Nov. 20 debate after jockeying that pitted Perry\u2019s studio in heavily Democratic southwest Atlanta against the sparkling new performance arts center in Sandy Springs, once-solid Republican territory that\u2019s become increasingly competitive.\n\n\u201cThe hosts of the event, The Washington Post and MSNBC, did not comment, and some involved in the negotiations said final details have yet to be hashed out. But Stacey Abrams, the party\u2019s 2018 nominee for governor, said on social media that the \u2018site is set\u2019 for the studio.\u201d AJC\n\n-- COUCH CUSHION TIME \u2026 NYT\u2019S SHANE GOLDMACHER: \u201c\u2018We\u2019re Asking You to Dig Deep\u2019: Biden Seeks to Steady Finances as Allies Fret\u201d: \u201cSteve Ricchetti, one of Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s closest confidantes, is reaching out to wary donors to shore up support. The Biden presidential campaign is watching costs \u2014 some staff members are sleeping at homes of volunteers \u2014 and facing criticism for spending on chartered jets. Mr. Biden\u2019s team is also urging allies to redouble fund-raising efforts before the calendar turns to 2020 and he has fewer days to devote to the money trail.\n\n\u201cAnd in a confidential memo to top bundlers this week, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, sought to allay growing concerns that Mr. Biden is facing a cash crunch and won\u2019t be able to stay competitive with his rivals on the airwaves and on the ground. \u2018We will have the resources we need to execute our plan,\u2019 Mr. Schultz wrote in the memo, obtained by The New York Times. But he simultaneously exhorted the money-raisers to do more: \u2018We\u2019re asking you to dig deep.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Biden campaign and its backers are racing to contain fallout from revelations this month that his campaign is spending more money than it is taking in, unlike his leading rivals. Mr. Biden\u2019s cash on hand \u2014 $9 million \u2014 is now only a fraction of what Senators Bernie Sanders ($33.7 million) and Elizabeth Warren ($25.7 million) have banked. He even has less on hand than two candidates, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris, who are well behind him in the polls.\u201d NYT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S SATURDAY \u2026 No public events.\n\n\n\nPLAYBOOK READS\n\nPHOTO DU JOUR: Pallbearers carry the casket of the late Rep.
