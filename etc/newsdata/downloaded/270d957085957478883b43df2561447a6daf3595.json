All these may make crude appear like a winner.\n\nThe truth, though, is the oil market is at an inflection point where neither bull nor bear can probably tell with a great deal of accuracy where things are headed.\n\nOn the face of it, the recent fairy tale run of epic crude draws in the United States should unravel from here, given the end of the peak summer driving period.\n\nYet, instead of building from September, on some years, crude inventories have continued falling till October. Last year, for instance, after the drawdown of 5.8 million barrels in the penultimate week of August, for four weeks in a row stockpiles continued to decline for a cumulative 14.2 million barrels.\n\nHence, anticipation is strong among oil longs that the back-to-back inventory drops of 10 million and nearly 5 million barrels over the past two weeks will continue, albeit in a smaller way.\n\nThis is the good stuff for oil bulls.\n\nNow for the bearish bit: The U.S. trade war with China, for all intent and purposes, is far from over.\n\nWhile this week\u2019s gain in oil was partly on the euphoria that Washington and Beijing were to restart negotiations in October, history has shown that such talks have often broken off to leave both sides in worse positions than before, and for tariffs to only go higher.\n\nOn Sept 1, the Trump administration began imposing a 15% tariff on an array of Chinese imports, after earlier move to install a 5% duty on -- the first of its kind. The United States also plans to increase to 30% from Oct. 1 the 25% duty placed on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\nAll these leave recession worries very much alive for global investors. Hence, \u201cdemand bears\u201d are also remaining influential in oil, creating the whipsaw volatility seen throughout August.\n\nOn coming Thursday, OPEC\u2019s Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meets in Abu Dhabi to review the 1.2 million barrels per day of production cuts that the cartel and its key ally Russia have carried out since December. After the review, the committee will also recommend to OPEC\u2019s top leadership what else needs to be done to bolster oil prices. This can mean more market swings as traders try and interpret its words.\n\nIn gold, the situation is also tricky for longs as the impending Federal Reserve meeting between Sept 17 and 18 makes investors unsure of what to do till then. Will the Fed cut rates again as it did in July? Or will it stay this time? Gold\u2019s $1,500 support depends very much on that outcome. The European Central Bank rate decision in the coming week will also help shape direction for gold.\n\nEnergy Review\n\nIt\u2019s back to parsing the tea leaves for crude traders, after Fed chief Jerome Powell's vow to support U.S. economic growth helped oil prices on Friday to their biggest weekly gain since July.\n\nThe weekly gain of 2.6% came as back-to-back U.S. stockpile declines and a promised restart of trade talks also faced off with an impending seasonal decline in oil demand amid signs that some in OPEC were overproducing.\n\nPowell's remarks Friday in Zurich that he saw little chance of a recession any time soon helped send stock prices higher and spread to the oil markets.\n\nNew York-traded , the U.S. benchmark blend, settled at $56.52 per barrel. For the week, it rose 2.6%, its biggest weekly advance since July.\n\nLondon-traded , the international benchmark blend, extended its perch above the key $60 level, to $61.47.\n\nSince August, has been whipsawed by volatility, with daily moves of more than 2% being the new normal.\n\nSwiss bank UBS said last week the worsening demand outlook would push down as far $55.\n\nFrankfurt-based Commerzbank (DE: ), meanwhile, cut its forecasts by $5 a barrel to an average of $60 through the end of 2020.\n\nWTI \"should be just \u2018sitting\u2019 at $55 in my view and probably $59 in ,\u201d Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP (LON: ) in Durham, N.C., said in an email to Investing.com.\n\n\u201cBut noise generated by CTA systematic trading and \u2018algos-generated pain trades\u2019 is driving the market as it reacts to the macro story, which in my opinion is largely moot for the oil space in the near term, until we can get a better feel for supply growth in 2020.\u201d\n\nEnergy Calendar Ahead\n\nMonday, Sept 9\n\nGenscape Cushing crude stockpile estimates (private data)\n\nTuesday, Sept 10\n\nweekly report on oil stockpiles.\n\nWednesday, Sept 11\n\nEIA weekly report on\n\nThursday, Sept 12\n\nEIA\n\nOPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee Meeting\n\nFriday, Sept 13\n\nweekly rig count\n\nPrecious Metals Review\n\nGold posted its second straight weekly loss on Friday, moving closer to the key $1,500 support, after the U.S. central bank chief downplayed prospects for a recession in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\n, reflective of trades in bullion, last traded at $1,507 per ounce on Friday, down 0.9% on the day after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the most likely case was for the U.S. was a continuation of moderate growth. Bullion lost 2.2% on Thursday for its largest one-day decline in 2019.\n\nfor December delivery settled at $1,515.50 per ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, also down 0.9% on the week. In Wednesday\u2019s session, December gold hit a more than six-year high of $1,566.15. December gold settled down 2.2% on Thursday, its largest drop since January.\n\nWith the declines from Thursday and Friday, ended lower for a second week in a row.\n\nScores of investors, from day-traders to hedge funds and multi-billion dollar institutions, had piled into gold in recent months, looking for a hedge against collapsing bond yields, currency and equity market flux, sliding global rates, the Brexit scare and recession fears over the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nPowell\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. might be recession-proof debunked at least one pillar for gold\u2019s support this year, though the Fed chair also kept alive hopes for another U.S. rate cut by saying the central bank was ready to \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to support the expansion of the U.S. economy.\n\n\"Recession is not a likely outcome for the U.S. or the global economy,\" Powell said as the nation\u2019s jobs report for August came in less robust than expected.\n\nPowell's comments came ahead of the Fed's two-day policy meeting scheduled for Sept. 17-18.\n\nThe Fed dropped 25 basis points at its last policy meeting in August and is expected to do the same in September, bringing rates to a range of between 1.75% and 2%. The on Investing.com is giving a 92% chance so far for another 25-bp cut.\n\nIf that happens, gold could regain steam for an upward trek, possibly into $1,600 territory. If the Fed stays, then $1,500 support could become rather tenuous.\n\nThe European Central Bank\u2019s rate decision on coming Thursday will, meanwhile, lend some direction for gold.", "description": "Energy & Precious Metals - Weekly Review and Calendar Ahead", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB9J09K_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
