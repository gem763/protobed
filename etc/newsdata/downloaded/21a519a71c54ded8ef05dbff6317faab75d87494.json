Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez was bumped to No. 2 from No. 5, where he started in the Cardinals\u2019 8-1 loss in Game 3 on Monday.\n\nThere are other shifts to the order, with only two spots unchanged: Paul Goldschmidt at No. 3, and Marcell Ozuna in the cleanup spot.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt has benched Dexter Fowler and made several other changes to his slumping lineup for Game 4 of the NL Championship Series against the Washington Nationals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/nlcs_cardinals_nationals_baseball_15774_c0-129-3108-1942_s1200x700.jpg?bfaccf6a0f4501dda15b7a55a4ab063badd3b1f3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
