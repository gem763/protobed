The complaint, which Trump has dubbed a \"hoax,\" has led to a formal impeachment inquiry, announced Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nThe Times reported that an attendee recorded Trump\u2019s remarks, which focused on the whistleblower, and the recording was obtained by the paper.\n\nCNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: \u2018IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING\u2019\n\n\u201cYou know, these animals in the press\u2026 they\u2019re animals, some of the worst human beings you\u2019ll ever meet,\u201d Trump reportedly said. When someone in the room shouted \"fake news,\" Trump responded: \u201cThey\u2019re scum. Many of them are scum, and then you have some good reporters, but not many of them, I\u2019ll be honest with you.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe event reportedly took place as Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, blasted the media during a hearing with the acting director of national intelligence that discussed the whistleblower complaint.\n\nMEDIA 'MOVE THE GOALPOSTS' AFTER RELEASE OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT\n\n\u201cThis operation began with media reports -- from the prime instigators of the Russian collusion hoax -- that a whistleblower is claiming President Trump made a nefarious \u2018promise\u2019 to a foreign leader,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cThe released transcript of the call has already debunked that central assertion, but that didn\u2019t matter. The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there doesn\u2019t need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president.\u201d\n\nNunes added that the mainstream media used the same playbook to repeatedly push allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to forget about all those stories but believe this one,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has attacked the mainstream media on a regular basis since entering the world of politics, often calling CNN \u201cfake news\u201d and referring to The New York Times as \u201cfailing.\u201d He has also mocked NBC News, saying the organization is \u201cworse\u201d than the ratings-challenged CNN.", "description": "President Trump referred to reporters as \u201cscum\u201d during a private event at the Intercontinental Hotel\u00a0in New York on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles Times.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
