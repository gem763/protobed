Apart from the wonderful people I meet daily, and the fabulous organisations I work with, I have always believed that it is through politics that real and positive change can be made to our communities and country.\n\n'But the clear impact on my family and the other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job of a modern MP can only be justified if, ultimately, Parliament does what it is supposed to do - represent those we serve in all areas of policy, respect votes cast by the electorate and make decisions in the overall national interest.'\n\nMs Morgan, a Remainer who said she accepted the result of the referendum, announced the decision on Twitter\n\nMs Morgan cited the 'clear impact' on her family as well as the abuse she has received for her desire to leave the Commons\n\nIt came as Boris Johnson sparked a public spat with Amber Rudd over his decision not to let her back into the Tory fold.\n\nThe Hastings and Rye MP gave up the Conservative whip in solidarity with 21 Remainer rebels who were expelled by the PM last month.\n\nEx-Tory Remainers Dominic Grieve and Antoinette Sandbach say they will stand AGAINST the party at the next election Two former Tories booted out by Boris Johnson said today they will run against the party at the general election. Hardcore Remainers Dominic Grieve and Antoinette Sandbach were among 21 Conservatives stripped of the whip in September after voting to block a No deal Brexit. Mr Grieve, a former attorney general and mastermind of several backbench revolts against the Government, confirmed he will run again in Beaconsfield. And Ms Sandbach said she would also go head-to-head with a Tory in Eddisbury, Cheshire. It came after they were not named among 10 of the 21 rebels who were readmitted to the Tory ranks yesterday, because their actions were seen as beyond the pale. Mr Grieve said he assumes the Tories will put a candidate up against him in his constituency of Beaconsfield. He told the BBC's Today programme: 'I will run as an independent. I've made that decision. I have no idea what the outcome will be.\n\nTen of the MPs were brought back into the fold last night as Mr Johnson gears up for the looming election battle.\n\nMs Rudd said this morning she would not be standing in the national ballot on December 12 - but made clear she was hoping to have the whip restored.\n\nHowever, in a brutal letter chief whip Mark Spencer refused her plea to be let back in. 'You were clear that you did not support the approach of the PM and did not have confidence in him,' he said.\n\n'I take the view that the receipt of the whip is an honour, not a right and as such it cannot be discarded or returned at will if it is to have any meaning.'\n\nThe missive provoked a furious response from Ms Rudd, who shot back: 'Funny thing really, as just last week the PM asked me to stand in the General Election.'\n\nShe also delivered a thinly-veiled swipe at maverick Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings, saying the chief whip had been briefed by the 'wrong No10 sources'.\n\nIt underlines the dramatic fall from grace for Ms Rudd, who was once touted as a potential future Tory leader.\n\nMs Rudd had a wafer-thin majority of just 346 in the 2017 election - meaning her seat is one of Labour's top targets.\n\nHowever, the constituency voted 56 per cent for Leave, suggesting that a Brexiteer Conservative candidate might have better prospects.\n\nIn a brutal letter (right), chief whip Mark Spencer refused the plea from Amber Rudd (left) to be let back in to the Tory fold\n\nThe chief whip's missive provoked a furious Twitter response from Ms Rudd\n\nThe Tory rebels who have had the whip restored Alistair Burt Caroline Nokes Greg Clark Sir Nicholas Soames Ed Vaizey Margot James Richard Benyon Stephen Hammond Steve Brine Richard Harrington\n\nBill to trigger December 12 General Election clears the House of Lords Legislation to trigger a pre-Christmas general election has cleared its first hurdle in the House of Lords. The one-page Bill, which has already been passed by the Commons, received an unopposed second reading by peers. The draft legislation looks set to complete its remaining stages this evening before heading for the statute book and so enable Parliament to be dissolved on November 6, paving the way for an election on December 12. The Early Parliamentary General Election Bill Bill sets aside the provisions of the Fixed-Term Parliament's Act, meaning the Government did not require a two-thirds 'super majority' to get it through. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson watched on, Lords leader Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, opening the debate, said and election 'presents a chance to resolve the impasse this country has endured for too long'. She added: 'Having an election will allow us to all put our cases to the public, gives them the opportunity to decide how they want to move forward, and to ensure the new government has time to act before January 31 2020.'\n\n'I'm not finished with politics, I'm just not standing at this election,' Ms Rudd told the Evening Standard.\n\nShe added: 'I spoke to the Prime Minister and had a good meeting with him a few days ago. I'm really confident of my position.\n\n'I will be leaving the House of Commons on perfectly good terms with the Prime Minister and I want him to succeed.'\n\nMs Rudd said she will meet Chief Whip Mark Spencer today and ask for the whip back. I'm happy to leave the House of Commons as a Conservative MP,' she said.\n\nA string of other prominent pro-Remain MPs have announced they are standing down. They include Theresa May's former deputy Sir David Lidington and former ministers Sir Patrick McLoughlin, Sir Alan Duncan, Kenneth Clarke, Sir Oliver Letwin, Sir Nicholas Soames, Claire Perry, Richard Benyon, Seema Kennedy, Alistair Burt and Mr Johnson's brother Jo.\n\nVeteran MP Keith Simpson, who is also stepping down, last night warned a battle was under way for the soul of the Conservative Party, which risked alienating Tory moderates.\n\nHe added: 'There are so many good One Nation colleagues standing down. Boris may get back some Brexiteer Tory and Labour voters but he is losing the liberal Conservatives \u2013 it's how not to get a majority.'\n\nMrs Morgan, who has represented Loughborough since 2010, insisted she was not quitting because of political differences with the PM. Sources said she would join him on the campaign trail during the election.\n\nIt is understood her decision was prompted by 'family reasons', although she is also said to have tired at the abuse levelled at her during years of fractious Brexit debates.\n\nIn a statement last night, the mother of one said being an MP had been 'the greatest privilege of my life'.\n\nBut she also cited 'the clear impact on my family and the other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job of a modern MP'.\n\nMr Lidington, who is MP for Aylesbury, cited the 'heavy cost' of politics on family life in a letter to The Bucks Herald newspaper.\n\nMs Rudd said she had a 'good meeting' with Boris Johnson (pictured in the Commons today) and was happy to return to the Tory fold\n\nGreg Clark, the former business secretary, and Sir Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, were among the 10 rebels who had the whip restored\n\nDominic Grieve, a former attorney general and mastermind of several backbench revolts against the Government, confirmed he will run again as an Independent\n\nMs Sandbach (left) said she would also go head-to-head with a Tory in Eddisbury, Cheshire\n\nA graphic showing where the vote will be won and lost throughout the country in the snap poll taking place on December 12\n\nRemainers warn Tories will win 44 majority without tactical voting The Tories will achieve a majority of 44 if no strategic voting took place - but anti-Brexit voters could scupper this by working together. A study by the Best for Britain campaign found if 30 per cent of Remain backers voted in this way they could swing the election and secure a Remain majority of four to deliver a Labour-backed second referendum. If 40 per cent of pro-Remain voters worked tactically they could return a majority of 36 and a leadership strongly reflecting their Brexit views, according to the research from the group campaigning to stay in the EU. The research was based on seat-by-seat analysis of 46,000 people over September and October, using a similar technique to one that gave a rare but accurate prediction that Donald Trump would become US president in 2016. Backed by Lib Dem MP Sir Vince Cable, exiled Tory Dominic Grieve and Labour's Anna McMorrin, the campaign is encouraging voters to visit getvoting.org to learn how to vote tactically. Tactical voting could worry Mr Johnson closer to home. He won his Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat in 2017 with 50 per cent of votes against Labour's 40 per cent.\n\nMrs Morgan's decision came just hours after Miss Rudd became locked in a bitter briefing war with No 10 after she was ruthlessly blocked from returning to the Tory fold. Miss Rudd, who quit as work and pensions secretary two months ago, announced she would not be contesting the next election.\n\nBut she said she wanted to regain the Tory whip for her final days in Parliament, after rebuilding bridges with Mr Johnson, a personal friend. However, that hope was brutally rebuffed by Tory chief whip Mark Spencer, who said he didn't trust her not to abandon the Prime Minister again.\n\nMiss Rudd immediately hit back, accusing 'No 10 sources' of briefing against her and revealing Mr Johnson tried \u2013 only last week \u2013 to convince her to stand at the election.\n\nHer allies claimed the PM had offered her the plum West Sussex seat being vacated by Sir Nicholas Soames.\n\nAt the end of September, Miss Rudd quit the Cabinet and the party in protest at Mr Johnson's Brexit strategy and his decision to expel 21 Tory rebels. At the time she accused him of abandoning attempts to leave with a deal, and called the expulsions an 'act of political vandalism'.\n\nOn Tuesday night Mr Johnson restored the whip to ten of the 21 who voted against him on Brexit \u2013 a move that appeared to signal he wanted to draw a line under his brutal purge.\n\nMiss Rudd then announced she would not be standing on December 12, but she told the Evening Standard: 'I'm not finished with politics, I'm just not standing at this election.'\n\nBoris Johnson (left in Downing Street last night) is facing off with Jeremy Corbyn (right leaving his London home this morning) in the Commons later\n\nThe likely manifestos for Boris Johnson's Tories and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party for the upcoming December 12 election\n\nThe leading One Nation Tory also revealed she had spoken to Mr Johnson last week and they were now on 'perfectly good terms'.\n\nShe said she intended to meet Mr Spencer and formally ask for the whip back, saying: 'I'm happy to leave the House of Commons as a Conservative MP.'\n\n'I spoke to the Prime Minister and had a good meeting with him a few days ago,' she revealed.\n\nBut just hours after the interview was published, Mr Spencer said she would not be allowed back in \u2013 because he feared she could 'change her mind' again.\n\nIn a letter, leaked to the Mail, he wrote: 'When you surrendered the Conservative Party whip and resigned from the Cabinet just eight weeks ago, you were clear that you did not support the approach of the Prime Minister and did not have confidence in him.'\n\nBoris Johnson is more trusted than Jeremy Corbyn to safely steward the NHS, new poll of voters reveals\n\nBy Simon Walters and Jason Groves for the Daily Mail\n\nBoris Johnson is more trusted to care for the NHS than Jeremy Corbyn, according to a poll for the Daily Mail.\n\nAsked which leader had the best health policies, 36 per cent of voters said Mr Johnson while 34 per cent opted for Mr Corbyn.\n\nIn another blow to the Labour leader, nearly one in six supporters of his party are terrified at the thought of him becoming prime minister. And four in ten would be more likely to stick with Labour in the December 12 General Election if Mr Corbyn stood down.\n\nEven Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson was seen as stronger, more statesmanlike and smarter than Mr Corbyn in the Survation poll of 1,010 voters.\n\nThe Labour leader yesterday used his last Commons clash with the Prime Minister before the election to accuse him of putting the NHS 'up for grabs' to secure a trade deal with the United States.\n\nMr Johnson dismissed the claims and said a Labour government would be an 'economic catastrophe'.\n\nThe graphic above shows how UK voters back Prime Minister Boris Johnson over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\n\nAsked which leader had the best health policies, 36 per cent of voters said Mr Johnson while 34 per cent opted for Mr Corbyn (above)\n\nEven Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson (pictured above) was seen as stronger, more statesmanlike and smarter than Mr Corbyn in the Survation poll of 1,010 voters\n\nThe election battle gets under way properly today, with Mr Johnson visiting a hospital in East Anglia in his drive to convince the public the NHS is safe in his hands. He will use this first campaign visit to accuse Mr Corbyn of thwarting his 'do or die' pledge to take Britain out of the EU on time.\n\nMr Johnson, who said he would rather be 'dead in a ditch' than delay Brexit beyond tonight, will acknowledge the deadline has been missed \u2013 but lay the blame on Labour.\n\nIn other electoral developments yesterday:\n\nNicky Morgan and Amber Rudd both announced they were quitting as MPs, leading a growing exodus from Parliament of Tory Remainers;\n\nMr Johnson is poised to make a substantial offer of free childcare in the Tory election manifesto;\n\nThe Prime Minister was also poised to announce a moratorium on fracking;\n\nMr Corbyn prepared to launch his campaign with a pledge to tackle the 'corrupt system' of tax dodgers and bad bosses;\n\nLabour was accused of risking the break-up of Britain by saying it wouldn't block a second Scottish independence referendum;\n\nThe Lib Dems were in talks with the Greens and Plaid Cymru over a Remain pact;\n\nNigel Farage suggested his Brexit Party will target Labour Leave seats;\n\nDominic Grieve and Antoinette Sandbach said they would stand as independents in their current seats \u2013 against Tory candidates;\n\nMr Corbyn challenged Mr Johnson to a TV debate during the campaign.\n\nToday's poll suggests that Mr Johnson's decision to make the NHS a top priority since entering No 10 is paying off. As well as being ahead on the NHS, the Prime Minister is 18 points ahead on jobs, a key issue for working-class voters.\n\nMr Johnson is streets ahead on the economy, defence, trade and foreign relations. The only issue where Mr Corbyn is in the lead is welfare.\n\nThe Tories have 34 per cent support overall, eight points ahead of Labour on 26, with the Lib Dems on 19 and the Brexit Party on 12.\n\nThat would be enough to give the Prime Minister a slim Commons majority.\n\nAccording to those surveyed, Mr Johnson's poll advantage could increase over the six-week contest. A total of 44 per cent say he is the best campaigner, with Mr Corbyn on 21 and Miss Swinson on ten. Asked who would be the best PM, Mr Johnson scores 42 and Mr Corbyn 19, only four ahead of Swinson on 15.\n\nNicky Morgan (left) and Amber Rudd (right) both announced that they were quitting as MPs Parliament, leading a growing exodus from Parliament of Tory Remainers\n\nAnd in an encouraging sign for Mr Johnson's attempt to squeeze the Brexit vote, support for Mr Farage's party continues to fall. It is now barely half the level it was before Mr Johnson entered No 10. In the same period, Tory support has steadily risen, suggesting Conservatives who switched to the Brexit Party when Theresa May was leader are returning to the fold.\n\nThe figures provide further evidence that Mr Corbyn's fence-sitting on Brexit could see Labour support haemorrhage to the fervently anti-Brexit Lib Dems.\n\nMr Johnson's Brexit stance is favoured by 41 per cent; Remainer Miss Swinson is on 23 with Mr Corbyn on a meagre 15.\n\nA total of 42 per cent of Labour supporters say they would be more likely to vote for the party if Mr Corbyn stepped down; 18 per cent say they would be less likely to vote Labour.\n\nNigel Farage (pictured above) suggested that the Brexit Party will target Labour Leave seats - which could still cost the Tories an election win\n\nDominic Grieve (left) and Antoinette Sandbach (right) said they would stand as independents in their current seats - against Tory candidates\n\nNor were voters convinced by Mr Corbyn's excuses for initially holding out against a December election.\n\nNearly half say he did so because he was scared of losing; 30 per cent say it was to avoid No Deal; just 9 per cent believed him when he said it would be too cold to vote.\n\nMore than half of voters (51 per cent) say Mr Johnson is right to have called a poll.\n\nAstonishingly, 15 per cent of Labour voters will feel 'fear' if Mr Corbyn triumphs on December 12; 58 per cent will be 'joyful.' Similarly, one in ten Labour voters will feel 'joy' if Mr Johnson is victorious; 73 per cent will be 'fearful'.\n\nThe Conservative lead extends across the parties' front benches. Chancellor Sajid Javid, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab are all more popular than Labour counterparts John McDonnell, Diane Abbott and Emily Thornberry.\n\nA total of 44 per cent blame Parliament for forcing the Prime Minister to break his 'die in a ditch' pledge to leave the EU by today; 32 per cent point the finger at Mr Johnson himself; 11 per cent blame Brussels.\n\nSurvation interviewed 1,010 adults online on Tuesday and yesterday after all four main parties backed a December election.", "description": "The Culture Secretary is the latest Tory to say they won't stand in the forthcoming poll after Boris Johnson snubbed Amber Rudd's plea to have her whip restored.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/20/20394712-0-image-a-42_1572468240980.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
