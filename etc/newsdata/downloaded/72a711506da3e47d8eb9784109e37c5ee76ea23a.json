What they should do is allow you to order online and collect from store. Delivery would never be viable whilst maintaining their low prices. \u2014 Hannah (@rogue_canary) October 15, 2019 Report\n\nA store-only experience\n\nPrimark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, is well known for its very low prices.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn the last few years, the retailer has also become known for its merchandising agreements with high-profile film, TV, children's toys and video game brands including Harry Potter, Disney, Game of Thrones, Lol Surprise, Fortnite, Friends, Barbie, Stranger Things, Mean Girls, Peanuts and Garfield.\n\nThe chain, which was founded in 1969, does not have an online store or offer click-and-collect services for its products.\n\nIn November 2018, Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability Paul Lister was asked by MPs to justify how the retailer could afford to keep prices so low, as part of a government inquiry into the environmental impact of fast fashion.\n\nHe said that the fact Primark did not advertise at all which meant the retailer could save up to \u00a3150m a year.", "description": "The High Street chain says that it does not have a commercial relationship with Amazon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A46D/production/_109239024_primark-harrypotter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
