The week includes a monsoon of Tier 1 data, U.S. earnings, Brexit, an election in South America with a Federal Reserve thrown in.\n\nMoving to the most odious part of today\u2019s note, politics. Argentina voters went to the polls to elect a new president yesterday. A victory by the left-leaning Peronist candidate, Alberto Fernandez, looks almost guaranteed over the incumbent Mauricio Macri. The result is likely to send cold shivers through Latin American financial markets.\n\nLatin America is a much more unstable place now than just a few months ago when Argentina\u2019s initial presidential contagion was isolated to Argentina itself. Violent protests in Ecuador and Chile, the election of Jair \u201cBurn Baby Burn\u201d Bolsonaro in Brazil have shifted the dynamics on the continent as people push back against grinding inequality. The overflow this time has the potential to spill into other emerging markets outside of the region.\n\nBrexit developments this week may, or may not, see an election voted for and passed by Westminster today, or not, or amended. The European Union may, or may not, announce an extension to the Brexit deadline until January 31st. They may be waiting for election clarity from Britain before announcing any deadline extension though, or not. should continue to benefit; however, as a no-deal Brexit looks very remote now. Election uncertainty will conspire to cap gains for now, above 1.3000. I hope this clarifies Brexit for readers.\n\nThe (BOJ), (BOC) and the Federal Reserve all announce rate decisions this week. The BOJ and BOC, both on Thursday, should be no change non-events. The picture though is much more cloudy with the Fed.\n\nThe Street has priced in a 90%+ chance that the Fed by 0.25%. In my opinion, this is erroneous, with markets fitting the rate decision to the narrative they want to hear. At best the odds are 50/50 with the Fed unwilling to squander the fruits of its hard-won partial rates normalization on panic rate cuts. Slowing data in the United States has yet to see the previous two cuts flow through and the U.S. data itself is still doing quite nicely thanks.\n\nThe key will be in the wording of the statement with a stubborn FOMC likely to see a retracement higher in U.S. bond yields, a higher and some heat coming out of stock markets that are on record highs. There is no truth to the rumor that the President is going to send Delta Force to the Federal Reserve if they don\u2019t cut.\n\nU.S. earnings become seriously busy this week with Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) all announcing along with unicorns Uber (NYSE: ) and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: ). Old school stalwarts General Electric (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Exxon (NYSE: ) Mobile also announce.\n\nIn total, some 160 companies will announce this week. I won\u2019t speculate on the results themselves I do note, however, that companies that miss earnings or growth forecasts have been severely punished thus far. I expect that trend to continue as investors remain nervous on global growth and with stock markets at record levels.\n\nThe packed data calendar for the week started yesterday with China\u2019s falling a more than expected 2.1%. That may give mainland stock traders food for thought before pushing the buy button today. China releases official on Thursday and on Friday.\n\nU.S. is released on Wednesday ahead of the FOMC decision. U.S. and is released Thursday, a day before data, followed by the to round out Friday. The Nonfarms are expected to fall to 90,000 but may be distorted by the General Motors strike. My feeling is that poor data prints will send the clamour for the Federal Reserve to move in December into overdrive.\n\nOverall it is hard to know where to start with what must be one of the most substantial data and event risk weeks of the year. Stock markets and energy will likely be punished should earnings or data from the U.S. or China disappoint. Today in Asia is likely to be the quietest day of the week, but one thing is for sure, we won\u2019t be bored this week.\n\nEquities\n\nWall Street finished within whispering distance of record highs on Friday, spurred higher on positive talk from the U.S.-China trade talks and expectations of an FOMC rate cut this week. The rose 0.41%, the rose 0.70%, and the rose 0.56%. Trade deal or not; rate cut or not; stocks are now at heady levels, and remain vulnerable to poor results from the avalanche of Q3 earnings announcements this week.\n\nThe fall in China Industrial Profits is likely to take the edge of the Asian market\u2019s bullish sentiment after Friday\u2019s Wall Street advances. That caution has seen the and rise only 0.20% in early trading.\n\nCurrencies\n\nWith Singapore on holiday today, currency trading will be muted somewhat this morning. The rose on Friday as U.S. Treasury yields moved higher. The Dollar Index advanced 0.21% to 97.84. The eased to 1.1070, and the GBP eased to 1.2820 as Brexit and election uncertainty weighed on both.\n\nAsia is off to a quiet start after little news of note over the weekend. The majors are almost unchanged across the board. Currency markets are likely to hold their fire until later this week, awaiting the FOMC and Nonfarm Payrolls, happy to let equities do the FOMO tail-chasing intra-day.\n\nOil\n\nedged higher on Friday, concluding a strong week as trade-talk progress continued to bolster prices. rose 0.70% to $62.00 a barrel and WTI rose 1.0% to $56.50 a barrel.\n\nOil\u2019s rally has been driven by optimism and not reality. Thus it remains vulnerable to a potentially ugly downside correction.\n\nSoft data from the U.S. or China, a no-cut Fed this week or a speed bump on trade talks, could all quickly derail the recent rally. Traders should tread carefully as the week begins.Both contracts are lower by 0.20% after China Industrial Profits data showed a more significant than expected fall.\n\nGold\n\nspiked to $1517.00 an ounce on Friday on what looked like a sizeable one-off transaction. It failed ahead of resistance and just as quickly fell back to be almost unchanged at $1504.00 an ounce.\n\nResistance remains intact at $1520.00 an ounce with longer-term support at $1475.00. Gold\u2019s fate is intrinsically intertwined with the FOMC rate decision and Friday\u2019s U.S. data rather than its own fundamentals.\n\nGold has started the week quietly unchanged from Friday. It will likely stay that way as it awaits the main events from North America this week.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by MarketPulse (Jeffrey Halley) covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, XAU/USD, S&P 500.
