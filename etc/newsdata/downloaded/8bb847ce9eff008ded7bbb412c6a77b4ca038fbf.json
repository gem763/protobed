Kirsty Needham\n\nChina dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.\n\nWhat began as opposition to a proposed extradition law, that could have seen people sent for trial in mainland courts, has grown into a call for five demands, including universal suffrage and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.\n\nProtesters, some wearing gas masks and helmets, marched past some of the city's most expensive real estate including British bank HSBC's head office, on Friday, calling out for \"five demands, not one less\".\n\n\"We need to stay strong for Hong Kong and that is why I am joining this flash mob protest,\" Chan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe protests have been inflamed by the police shooting of a teenaged secondary school student on Tuesday during a clash, and more rallies are expected later in the evening and over the weekend.\n\nPolice said the officer involved in the shooting acted in self-defence because his life was under threat. The teenager, the first protester hit by live fire during months of unrest, is in hospital in a stable condition.\n\nEnforcing the ban on face masks will be problematic. Kirsty Needham\n\nRiot police moved in to districts across Hong Kong overnight, firing tear gas at a chanting crowd in a residential area, while rail operator MTR Corp shut several stations as violence escalated.\n\nAll stations were operating normally on Friday morning.\n\nMTR's operations director Adi Lau urged protesters to stop damaging station facilities and rail tracks, saying it could hinder services and pose a severe danger to passenger safety.\n\nPro-Beijing groups have also been pushing for legislation to ban face masks at demonstrations but the government has declined to comment on whether it was considering one, or broader emergency laws, stating it would study existing legislation to cope with the protests.\n\nAuthorities have already loosened guidelines on the use of force by police, according to documents seen by Reuters.\n\nAAP", "description": "Even before the new rule was confirmed, protests against it began across the Asian financial hub.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2466%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_152%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cb147cbd29f4baee0b8a60ecea5c55bfe4b2ecd0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
