REUTERS/Francisco Bonilla\n\nThis year he has an added complication - trying to work out which forms are needed to get crops of fresh produce like lettuce and tomatoes through French and British customs in the event that Britain leaves the European Union without a withdrawal agreement.\n\n\u201cOur peak season starts now,\u201d said Colomina, head of Coexphal, an association representing more than 9,000 farmers in Almeria, southern Spain, who send dozens of trucks daily to Britain laden with everything from broccoli to watermelons.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what kind of documentation we\u2019ll need until we know what kind of Brexit will happen,\u201d he added. With just three weeks before Britain is due to leave the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc, it is still unclear on what terms it will leave or indeed whether it will become the first sovereign state to depart the European project.\n\nIt\u2019s a big unknown causing headaches in farms across Spain, Britain\u2019s biggest foreign supplier of fruit and vegetables.\n\nBritain\u2019s putative Oct. 31 exit date from the EU comes at the height of Spain\u2019s export season when the end of the British summer heralds imported tomatoes and lettuce grown in huge industrial greenhouses in the year-round Mediterranean sun.\n\nGrowers and exporters will have to prepare paperwork to present at borders to smooth the passage of trucks and prevent delays that could turn perishable loads to garbage.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe administrations will be so blundering as to say it\u2019s all change from one day to the next because no-one is prepared,\u201d said Francisco Sanchez, manager of growers\u2019 association Onubafruit which represents over 1,000 farmers.\n\nNearly a third of Onubafruit\u2019s production - mostly strawberries, raspberries and blueberries - is exported to Britain, selling to supermarket groups like market leader Tesco (TSCO.L) and No. 2 Sainsbury\u2019s (SBRY.L).\n\nBoth growers and supermarkets fear a change in status of Britain overnight from EU member to default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO) could lead to huge queues at French ports with delays and millions of euros in losses.\n\nThe EU accounted for nearly two-thirds of Britain\u2019s imports of fruit and vegetables last year, according to the Office of National Statistics. Spain was the biggest foreign supplier of fresh produce, followed by the Netherlands.\n\nIn turn, Britain is an important market for Spanish produce - its third biggest - with fruit and vegetable exports worth nearly two billion euros last year.\n\nIf Britain leaves without a deal, trucks carrying produce from the trading bloc will have to have present customs, sanitary and quality control documents, Spain\u2019s Acting Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Luis Planas, told Reuters.\n\nSpain had done its preparation, he said, by setting up a process to present documents electronically and working alongside France which tested out its \u2018smart\u2019 border to speed entry into Britain last month.\n\n\u201cOur exporters want to sell,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHowever, many producers do not have these documents and processes in place, exporters and producers say.\n\nMany do not want to invest in software needed to present the documents electronically in case the no-deal scenario does not happen, said Jose Maria Pozancos, director of Fepex, the Spanish association of producers and exporters of fruit and vegetables.\n\nGrowers say they speak daily to British supermarkets, but are receiving no guidance from them as to what to expect.\n\nThe British government has said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, its priority is to keep goods moving and avoid delays at the border without compromising security.\n\nIt has indicated it would minimise checks or simply waive through lorries from EU countries.\n\n\u201cThe answer to all these questions is \u2018it depends\u2019 because nobody knows what the specifics will be,\u201d said Dave Lewis, chief executive of British supermarket chain Tesco.\n\nTesco was working closely with producers, Lewis told Reuters.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s declined to comment on specifics. However, it has repeatedly warned of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cThere will be an impact if there is a hard-edged Brexit on suppliers of certain types of short-life fresh foods, not least things like lettuces, citrus fruits, soft fruits and those kind of things which come from southern Europe at this time of year,\u201d Chief Executive Mike Coupe said.", "description": "At this time of year, Juan Colomina is preparing for the start of the harvest of thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables grown under plastic in southern Spain and exported to the world.", "authors": ["Sonya Dowsett", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439212936&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990RL", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
