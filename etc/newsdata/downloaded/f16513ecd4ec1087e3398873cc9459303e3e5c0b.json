Post writes that a recent selloff in the shares provides a buying opportunity ahead of third-quarter earnings.\n\nAt least partially offsetting the bullish call, MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni picked up coverage of the Snapchat parent Friday with a Neutral rating, a $16 price target, and a highly cautionary research note.\n\nSnap shares (ticker: SNAP) have had an eventful year. The stock more than tripled from $5.51 at year-end 2018 to $18.36 at its peak in July, then reversed course below $14 amid worries about the third quarter. The company is due to report third-quarter results after the close next Tuesday.\n\nMerrill\u2019s Post writes that investors appear to be concerned about both overly optimistic expectations for daily average user growth in the quarter and potential fourth-quarter weakness in average users. Recent checks suggest a decline in September and October ad user reach.\n\nBut he argues that strong downloads outside the U.S., increasing engagement with Snap\u2019s Discover video content, and normal fourth-quarter usage \u201cwill drive user growth in line\u201d with his forecast for 4 million net user adds, which is consistent with the Street consensus. In the second quarter, Snap added 13 million users, crushing Street estimates and driving up the stock price.\n\nPost says the Street is likely expecting a $10 million revenue beat in the quarter, above the high end of the guidance range of $410 million to $435 million. He says there\u2019s also optimism that revenue strength and continued expense management could lead to positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) for the company in the quarter, \u201cwhich may be a catalyst for the stock.\u201d\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nMeanwhile, Post is upbeat on Discover, which he sees boosting monetization, and he says that the launch of dynamic ads \u201cwill give Snap a new format to better compete for e-commerce spend in 2020.\u201d He also sees acceleration of the streaming-video market boosting online video ad spending over the next two years, and slightly raised his revenue forecast for next year as a result.\n\nShare Your Market Predictions Barron\u2019swants to know your thoughts on the market, the economy, and the political landscape.

Snap is trading at a premium valuation multiple to its peers and expected growth, implying high investor expectations over the near term, thus, we expect near-term choppiness in Snap shares as company fundamentals catch up to the shares\u2019 premium valuation.\u201d\n\nSnap shares are trading down 0.7%, at $13.69, in recent trading. The S&P 500 is down 0.2%.\n\nWrite to Eric J.
