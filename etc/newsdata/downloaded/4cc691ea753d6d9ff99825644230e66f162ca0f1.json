Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d \u2014 hit the Internet just before Silver was set to travel to China for promotional events centered around a pair of exhibition games between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nAD\n\nThe NBA\u2019s first statement on Morey\u2019s tweet began by saying, \u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d That garnered the league criticism in the United States from those who saw it as overly solicitous toward a repressive foreign regime, particularly given the league\u2019s culture of outspoken commentary by players and coaches on political and social issues.\n\nAD\n\nSilver said Thursday that the word \u201cregrettable\u201d was \u201cmodifying the fact that we\u2019d upset our Chinese fans.\u201d He added that \u201cthere was no regret directed to the [Chinese] government.\"\n\nThat initial statement was followed by another one in which Silver said his league \u201cwill not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt a news conference last week in Tokyo, a day before he joined the Lakers and Nets in Shanghai, Silver asserted, \u201cI want this to be clear, and I think there\u2019s been some confusion around this: We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression.\"\n\nAD\n\nThe commissioner said Thursday that when he and his staff saw the use of \u201cregrettable\u201d being \u201cmisinterpreted,\u201d they \u201cwanted to make an absolute clear statement, that the values of the NBA, these American values \u2014 we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\u201d\n\nUpon his return to the United States, Silver found it \u201cconfusing\u201d that the NBA was still being excoriated for its reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI had thought we\u2019d taken a principled position. I thought we hadn\u2019t so-called \u2018acquiesced\u2019 to the Chinese,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\n\"We wanted to make an absolute clear statement that the values of the NBA, these American values \u2014 we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver says at the #TIME100Health Summit pic.twitter.com/0V2YwPAPUF \u2014 TIME (@TIME) October 17, 2019\n\nAn ESPN report Tuesday indicated that Lakers star LeBron James advocated for Morey to receive some sort of punishment. At a meeting in Shanghai between Silver and the two NBA teams, James was said to have argued that if a player caused as huge a problem for the league with a tweet or comment, that player would face repercussions.\n\nSilver reportedly pushed back by noting that the NBA has done nothing to muzzle players who have spoken out sharply against President Trump, a group that includes James himself. The four-time NBA MVP also insisted, per ESPN, that he and the other players on the China trip shouldn\u2019t have to answer questions while there about Morey\u2019s tweet, and Silver agreed to scrap all the news conferences planned around the two games they were set to play.\n\nAD\n\nUpon his return to Los Angeles, James made it clear that he was still upset at Morey, telling reporters Monday that the general manager was \u201cmisinformed or not really educated\u201d when he sent his tweet.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually,\u201d James said. \u201cJust be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do.\u201d\n\nThose remarks quickly generated a negative response, with James painted by many as a hypocrite who was more concerned with selling shoes in China than supporting the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.\n\nJames subsequently posted a pair of tweets in which he said he was \u201cnot discussing the substance\u201d of Morey\u2019s tweet but the \u201cconsequences and ramifications\u201d of it.\n\n\u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose messages, as well as comments Tuesday in which James said, \u201cI also don\u2019t think every issue should be everybody\u2019s problem as well,\u201d did not appear to represent a major success in damage control for him. As for the NBA\u2019s relationship with China, Silver said Thursday that he was \u201cnot even sure where we\u2019ll go from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe losses have already been substantial,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cOur games are not back on the air in China, as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d\n\nNoting that he has been visiting China for 15 years, as the NBA has been staging games there, Silver said, \u201cI felt we had made enormous progress in terms of building cultural exchanges with the Chinese people, and, again, I have regret that much of that was lost.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe financial consequences,\u201d he added, \u201chave been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The NBA commissioner also said the league has already suffered \"fairly dramatic\" financial fallout in China.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXaTYomWqa7BgJfv-TahOzyAygc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BSGSEJHNIII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
