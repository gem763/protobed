Customers had a much better idea of what to expect. Sadly, it didn\u2019t last.\n\nLater that same year the airline filed for bankruptcy protection, heralding the start of a 19-month restructuring process, which saw the number of routes cut back and the loss of 6,000 jobs. During that painful period, the airline gradually undid all the headline benefits associated with SimpliFare, returning the company to a more complex and opaque situation that pretty much exists to this day.\n\nBut is the airline about to resurrect the program \u2014 or at least something like it? Perhaps, according to one of its executives.\n\n\u201cI think SimpliFares might have been too simple and maybe as an industry we weren\u2019t ready for it, we didn\u2019t have the sophistication to really manage it well,\u201d Delta President Glen Hauenstein told analysts on Thursday during a third quarter earnings conference call.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s really the infrastructure we are putting in place now and how we see the evolution of pricing occurring over the next years. One of the things that you would have to admit about the industry in general is it\u2019s transactional and it\u2019s not really trusted very well.\u201d\n\nHauenstein pointed to the inconsistency facing customers with the huge fluctuations in prices for what amounts to the same thing: a seat on a plane. But as airlines like Delta and others collect and analyze more data, they should be able to offer something much more consistent.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] not really simple fares but it\u2019s more reliable fares and it\u2019s not a revolution, it\u2019s an evolution. So we are on a journey on this and we are trying to be less transactional and more customer-driven,\u201d he said.\n\nTrade Wars Update\n\nThe World Trade Organization last week ruled in favor of the United States in a dispute with the European Union over subsidies to aircraft manufacturers Airbus.\n\nThe decision gave the opportunity to increase tariffs on certain goods, which the Trump regime duly decided to take up.\n\nAs well as paying more for products like French wine and Scotch whisky, aircraft imported from the EU will be more expensive.\n\nFor U.S. carriers like Delta that fly a lot of Airbus planes and have many more on order, it\u2019s a big concern.\n\nCEO Ed Bastian, who spoke recently at Skift Global Forum, said that companies were being punished for \u201cdecisions taken in the past\u201d. And while he said there were unlikely to be any increased costs in this area between now and the end of the year, there was some uncertainty heading into 2020.\n\n\u201c[We] are examining our options next year to make sure that we mitigated any increase to the prices that we\u2019d already negotiated with Airbus. So at this point, we are looking at our options.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into any details around the option since it\u2019s still pretty fluid at the moment. But we do not expect this is going to be a material cost to Delta, certainly not in the near term.\u201d\n\nThird-Quarter Results\n\nDelta reported a third-quarter pre-tax profit of $1.9 billion, up 15 percent on the prior year and slightly above analyst forecasts. Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.6 billion.\n\nDelta\u2019s domestic network was the star performer in the period with revenue up 7.8 percent to $8 billion, offsetting weakness in the Pacific region.\n\nSubscribe to Skift newsletters covering the business of travel, restaurants, and wellness.", "description": "When Delta Air Lines introduced its new domestic ticket structure, SimpliFares, at the start of 2005, many in the industry saw it as a total revolution in pricing.
