Praying at five set times during the day is one of Islam\u2019s core requirements.\n\n\u201cClearly I was being discriminated against because of my religion,\u201d Indorewala said at a press conference organized by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the advocacy group that filed a lawsuit in federal court this week on her behalf.\n\nIndorewala, a 26-year-old who currently works at the Center for Autism & Related Disorders, applied for an entry-level manager position at Fast Trak last fall to get more experience in the marketing sector, according to the complaint. During her second in-person interview with the company, she was reportedly informed by an assistant manager that the job included a 90-minute lunch break.\n\nIndorewala said she asked if she could shorten the lunch break and instead take two five minute breaks during the day to pray. Indorewala claims the assistant manager informed her that this wasn\u2019t possible and abruptly ended the interview. The assistant manager then walked Indorewala to a common area and told company CEO Ramses Gavilondo in front of other staff that the \u201chours don\u2019t work for her,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nGavilondo allegedly \u201cthrew his arms up in the air and chastised her exclaiming \u2018this is a business.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe then pointed at her hijab and mocked her, saying \u2018Religion? I don\u2019t wanna deal with that here. We don\u2019t want those shenanigans here,\u2019\u201d the complaint states. \u201cHe took Ms. Indorewala\u2019s file, crossed out her information, and refused to hire her.\u201d\n\nIndorewala said she was \u201chumiliated\u201d by the exchange.\n\n\u201cI was in shock, I think it took me a while to let it sink in,\u201d she said during the press conference. \u201cI was like, am I really being made fun of for my religion in public, in what\u2019s supposed to be a professional workplace?\u201d\n\nHuffPost has reached out to Fast Trak Management for comment.\n\nCAIRtv / YouTube Screenshot Shahin Indorewala applied for a job at Fast Trak Management last year. She said she was denied employment because of her request for religious accommodation.\n\nGavilondo told the Associated Press that he didn\u2019t hire Indorewala because she \u201cwanted to preach her religion.\u201d He added that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigated the situation and found no wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWe ask people to keep religion to themselves,\u201d Gavilondo said.\n\nThe company\u2019s website states that it has a \u201cstrict diversity policy that ensures everybody gets the equal opportunities they deserve, both when they are hired initially, and when promotions are available.\u201d\n\nIndorewala said she wasn\u2019t trying to preach about her religion, the AP reports. The complaint also states that Indorewala filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC last November and that it notified her of her right to sue in June.\n\nZanah Ghalawanji, a staff attorney with CAIR, insisted that Indorewala\u2019s request for religious accommodation did not impose an undue burden on Fast Trak\u2019s office operations. Prayer breaks can be taken in a private area without disturbing other employees, and at predetermined times, she said.\n\n\u201cFast Trak has absolutely no basis for what they did and they were very clear in the fact that they refused to hire Shahin because of those breaks,\u201d Ghalawanji said.", "description": "Shahin Indorewala is suing Fast Trak Management for allegedly refusing to hire her after she requested a religious accommodation.", "authors": ["Religion Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8ce46522000058005282c5.png?cache=kbtj3zeoxm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
