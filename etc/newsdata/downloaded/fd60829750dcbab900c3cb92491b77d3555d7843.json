Our city is on edge. Our teenagers are also on edge.\"\n\nMany of those gathered in the court and outside were wearing masks, in defiance of a government ban on the wearing of face-masks in public - as many protesters do to disguise their identities.\n\nThe case was been adjourned until Nov 14.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] The 18-year-old protester shot in the chest by Hong Kong police this week was throwing bricks and \"rioting\" at the time he was wounded, a prosecutor told a court packed with his supporters on Friday. .
