It feels as if my heart is breaking,\u201d said Japan Post Holdings President Masatsugu Nagato after bowing in apology at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nThe insurance unit said it would look into 183,000 policies sold over the past five years. In about 70,000 of those cases, customers appear to have been charged premiums twice when they changed their insurance policy, while in 19,000 cases policy holders were unable to switch to a new policy after canceling a previous one, it said.\n\nJapan Post Holdings is among the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, running a bank and life-insurance company alongside a unit that delivers the mail in Japan. Formerly an arm of the government, it has been privatized in stages over more than a decade, but the government remains the majority owner.\n\nThe insurance company, with nearly $700 billion in assets, faces pressure to become more profitable as ultra-low interest rates in Japan have made some types of insurance that resemble retirement-savings plans look less attractive. The company is among the biggest holders of Japanese government bonds, many of which carry negative interest rates.\n\n\u201cBecause of low interest rates, savings-style insurance is not very popular,\u201d Mr. Nagato said. The company is not permitted to make loans and create financial products freely like other private financial companies, he said.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental cause of the problem is low interest rates,\u201d said Takahiro Sekido, a strategist at MUFG Bank. \u201cAfter the privatization, the company has faced demands from shareholders asking it to strengthen its earning capacity and build a retail network that is profitable amid low interest rates.\u201d\n\nMr. Sekido said other financial companies have faced similar problems under the Bank of Japan \u2019s monetary-easing policy.\n\nThe privatization of Japan Post was a goal first set by then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi about 15 years ago. In 2007, Japan Post Holdings was established, with insurance, banking and postal service units under its umbrella. Eight years later, shares of the holding company went public, and shares in the insurance and banking subsidiaries were also separately listed. The holding company now owns 64.5% of the insurance unit.\n\nJapan Post Holdings sold nearly 140 million shares in Japan Post Insurance worth about $3 billion in April. The company said it was aware of some complaints by insurance policy holders at the time but didn\u2019t know the magnitude of the problem.\n\nSince then, Japan Post Insurance\u2019s shares have fallen sharply as word of the scandal emerged. Shares closed up 2.1% Wednesday but are down more than 30% from their recent peak in April.\n\nThe government has said it plans to keep selling down its stake in the holding company, but the timing is likely to be affected by the sales scandal.\n\n\u201cThis is bad for Japan Post\u2019s privatization,\u201d Kazumasa Iwata, the chairman of the privatization committee, said earlier this week.\n\nPost offices in Japan sell Japan Post Insurance policies as well as Japan Post Bank products. Kunio Yokoyama, president of the unit that operates the post offices, said the company would refrain from actively selling most financial products for now, including investment trusts.\n\nThe company has also abolished sales targets for its staff. Executives said the targets were unrealistic in the current environment.\n\nThe company has asked a panel of three former public prosecutors to conduct an independent investigation of the issue.\n\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com", "description": "Japan Post, which runs a bank, a life-insurance company and a unit that delivers the mail in Japan, said it may have victimized more than 100,000 customers by selling them disadvantageous products.", "authors": ["Megumi Fujikawa", "Megumi.Fujikawa Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-94506/social", "published_at": "2019-07-31"}
