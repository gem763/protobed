Former Vice President Joe Biden has led most opinion polls so far, followed by U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe sprawling field has made it difficult for lesser-known candidates to register in the minds of Democratic voters, with several polling at 1 percent or less nationally.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio ended his 2020 bid on Friday, saying the party\u2019s rules for qualifying for televised debates had made it hard for him to continue. He failed to qualify for a Sept. 12 debate that featured the 10 leading candidates for the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nCriteria for the September and October debates required donations from at least 130,000 people and support of at least 2% in four DNC-approved polls.\n\nU.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey will drop out of the running unless he can raise $1.7 million over the next 10 days left in the fundraising quarter, his campaign said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have the money to grow, we are not going to stay competitive in this race,\u201d Booker told MSNBC on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stick around if I\u2019m not in this to win it.\u201d\n\nThe next debate will be held in Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15 and possibly Oct. 16, depending on the number of qualifying candidates.\n\n(The story corrects first two paragraphs to show candidates must hit either polling threshold, not both, to qualify)", "description": "The Democratic National Committee on Monday announced new criteria for the fifth presidential debate in November, requiring candidates to meet one of two polling requirements and have 165,000 unique donors.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433074175&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1XT", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
