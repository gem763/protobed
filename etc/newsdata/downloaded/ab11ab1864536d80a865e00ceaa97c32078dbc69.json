It has named H. pylori - heavily linked to peptic ulcers and gastric cancer - among the most dangerous\n\nH. pylori is one of the most common infections, present in up to one in two people.\n\nIt can cause inflammation of the stomach lining, or gastritis, leading to peptic ulcers. The condition effects up to one in fifteen people in the UK alone.\n\nThe bacteria is also one of the most important risk factors for gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer - the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide.\n\nIn recent years, H. pylori antibiotic resistance has become a prominent and urgent issue across the globe.\n\nIn Ireland, a quarter of patients (25.6 per cent) were resistant to clarithromycin, the main drug for the bacteria - compared to just one in 20 (five per cent) in Denmark.\n\nOnly five other nations fared worse - Italy (36.9 per cent), Croatia (34.6 per cent), Greece (30 per cent), Poland (28.5 per cent) and Bulgaria (26.9 per cent).\n\nThe UK was not looked at in the study, presented at a meeting in Barcelona held by the United European Gastroenterology.\n\nProfessor Megraud's team now plan to compare the data with the level of antibiotic consumption in the individual countries.\n\nProf Mario Dinis-Ribeiro, the president of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, said: 'The findings are certainly concerning.\n\n'H. pylori is the main cause of peptic disease and gastric cancer. The increasing resistance of H. pylori to a number of commonly-used antibiotics may jeopardise prevention strategies.'\n\nEngland's outgoing chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies has warned antibiotic resistance risks 'putting medicine back in the dark ages'.", "description": "Rates of resistance of Helicobacter pylori against\u00a0clarithromycin jumped from under 10 per cent in 1998 to almost 22 per cent last year, according to French scientists.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/16/19997814-0-image-a-4_1571672879646.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
