Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement of his 2020 presidential run broke.\n\nThe move is a shrewd one for Ocasio-Cortez, as it demonstrates she's not softening her political tactics or looking to appease the Democratic establishment by playing the inside game.\n\n\"Placating party leaders will do little to help Ocasio-Cortez achieve the kind of transformative changes she wants,\" wrote Jacobin magazine. \"She seems to understand this.\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nFrom left, Rep.

Bernie Sanders scored a big win during Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate.\n\nBut the boost wasn't just a result of his performance on stage, which was generally well-received. It came largely from the news that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her two fellow progressive congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar would endorse his candidacy.\n\nDemocratic strategists across the spectrum agreed that Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement, in particular, is a strategic win for Sanders, particularly on the heels of his recent heart attack and following months of stagnant and even declining support for him in national polls.\n\n\"I think it's smart for the Sanders campaign to roll this out now,\" Rodell Mollineau, a DC-based Democratic strategist and consultant, told Insider. \"He is losing market share to Warren and his recent health problems are fresh in the minds of voters and the media.\"\n\nThe endorsements came as a surprise, even to progressive insiders, who thought Ocasio-Cortez would wait longer to decide between the two most progressive candidates in the race: Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has long been a Sanders supporter and volunteered for his 2016 campaign in her home district.

Writers Meagan Day and Nick French pointed out that Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are more closely aligned on both policy, including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, and on political philosophy, namely undermining what they believe is a corporate-backed Democratic establishment.", "description": "Bernie Sanders gets a political rock star's endorsement.
