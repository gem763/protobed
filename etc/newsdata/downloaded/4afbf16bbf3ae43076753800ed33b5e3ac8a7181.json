Just more Fake News!' Trump raged above a re-tweet of the Bloomberg story.\n\nIt comes after a disastrous week for Mulvaney - who has been serving as Trump's acting Chief of Staff since January.\n\nIn a press conference last Thursday, Mulvaney acknowledged that the Trump administration had held up aid to Ukraine in part to prod that country to investigate Democrats and the 2016 elections.\n\nPresident Donald Trump dismissed reports he is set to replace his acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney in an angry Twitter post on Tuesday night\n\nTrump's tweet comes after a disastrous week for Mulvaney - who has been serving as his acting Chief of Staff since January.\n\nHis statement appeared to be an admission of a quid pro quo - the basis of the current impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\n'We do that all the time with foreign policy,' he stated at the podium.\n\n'We were withholding money at the same time for, what was it, the Northern Triangle countries, we were withholding aid for Northern Triangle countries, so that they would change their policies on immigration. And I have news for everybody: get over it!'\n\nHe added: 'Elections have consequences and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.'\n\nBloomberg suggested Steve Mnuchin and Kellyanne Conway were being floated as potential replacements for Mulvaney\n\nThe comments caused a firestorm, with Mulvaney later saying he had been misconstrued.\n\n'Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,' he stated.\n\n'Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.'\n\nAlso on Thursday, Mulvaney tried to put a positive spin on Trump's selection of his Doral, Florida, golf resort to host next year's Group of Seven world summit.\n\nMulvaney appeared on Fox News Sunday over the weekend to defend his boss in effusive terms - and ended up making a new problematic comment.\n\nIn a press conference last Thursday, Mulvaney acknowledged that the Trump administration had held up aid to Ukraine in part to prod that country to investigate Democrats and the 2016 elections\n\nExplaining why Trump had tried to steer an international summit to one of his own properties before giving up on the idea, Mulvaney said Trump 'still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.'\n\nThat did nothing to allay concerns that the Republican president has used his office to enrich his business interests. Trump later cancelled plans to have the summit held at Doral.\n\nMeanwhile, Mulvaney denied on Fox News Sunday that there was any consideration of his resignation, stating: 'Absolutely, positively not.'\n\nMulvaney tried to put a positive spin on Trump's selection of his Doral, Florida, golf resort to host next year's Group of Seven world summit\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, a swift dismissal doesn't appear on the horizon, according to nine staffers and outside advisers, who noted the difficulties Trump has faced attracting and retaining high quality White House staff even before the impeachment episode.\n\nThe shortage of viable replacements has kept other officials in their posts months after he soured on them.\n\nEven before Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry, Mulvaney was allegedly on thin ice, with diminished status in the White House. He has reportedly frustrated aides who see him as less willing than his predecessors to challenge the president.\n\nOnce Democrats began investigations meant to remove Trump from office, Mulvaney drew the brunt of criticism from presidential allies who felt the White House wasn't prepared to fight back forcefully.\n\nHe has also clashed with White House counsel Pat Cipollone, sometimes mentioned as a potential Mulvaney successor, over strategy and tactics in response to impeachment.", "description": "The Commander-in-chief took to Twitter on Tuesday night to blast a Bloomberg article which claimed was considering Kellyanne Conway or Steven Mnuchin for Mulvaney's role.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/07/20069072-0-image-a-28_1571810850260.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
