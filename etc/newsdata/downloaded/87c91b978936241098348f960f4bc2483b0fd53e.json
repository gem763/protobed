Earnings Could Suffer, Goldman Sachs Warns.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nApple TV+ will come free for a year with the purchase of a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac.\n\nWhile that deal could lead to paid subscriptions in the future, how Apple (ticker: AAPL) accounts for this discount could hurt several key measures in the company\u2019s earnings report, according to an analyst at Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe back story. Apple sent shockwaves through the streaming world when it said its Apple TV+ offering will only cost $4.99 and come free for a year when you buy one of several new devices.\n\nThough the actual impact on rivals such as Netflix (NFLX) and Walt Disney (DIS) may be overstated due to the huge disparity between available content on competing platforms, services like Apple TV+ have become increasingly key to the company\u2019s growth and future earnings stability.\n\nWhat's new. Goldman analyst Rod Hall suggested in a note to clients Friday that a free year of Apple TV+ will hurt average selling prices on the products it comes with, as well as gross profits and earnings per share. That\u2019s if the company follows a similar accounting approach as it does with Apple Maps and Siri.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nIf someone bought a new iPhone 11 Pro for $1,000 (rounding up to simplify math) and signed up for the TV+ trial, they are actually buying an iPhone 11 Pro and TV+ bundle, valued at around $1,060, Hall noted.\n\nInstead of the discount being applied to only TV+ revenue, he suggests it would be applied to the whole package. That means the average selling price for the iPhone Pro would fall to $943.40, while the TV+ revenue would be discounted to $56.60.\n\n\u201cEffectively, Apple\u2019s method of accounting moves revenue from hardware to Services even though customers do not perceive themselves to be paying for TV+,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThough this might appear convenient for Apple\u2019s services revenue line it is equally inconvenient\u201d for hardware average selling prices, gross profits, and earnings per share in \u201chigh sales quarters\u201d such as the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which ends in December.\n\nAn Apple representative did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nApple stock was down 2.35% to $217.84 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broader S&P 500 index was about flat.\n\nLooking Ahead. Hall has a Neutral rating on Apple stock. His $165 price target implies 26% downside from the closing price on Thursday.\n\nHe estimates this accounting practice will cause average selling prices for iPhones to fall to $943.40 in the fiscal first quarter, at a lower gross margin since the cost of goods sold is unaffected by discounting.\n\n\u201cThe discounted TV+ revenue shows up as a credit to Deferred Revenue and then will be recognized on a monthly basis over the 12-month trial period,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe believe that TV+ COGS will be allocated to this revenue stream on a monthly basis as well.\u201d\n\nHis estimate, assuming a 25% gross margin contribution for the trial revenue, results in a negative impact to earnings per share of 16% in the first quarter and 14% for fiscal 2020, though it will have no impact on cash flow.\n\nHe also assumes the offer will only run for one year. \u201cShould it run longer, our out-year forecasts would also likely need to be adjusted in a similar way.\u201d\n\nWrite to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com", "description": "Apple TV+ will come free for a year with the purchase of a new iPhone and other products.
