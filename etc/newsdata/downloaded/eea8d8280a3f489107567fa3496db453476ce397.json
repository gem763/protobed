They include former CIA officers Kevin Mallory, convicted of espionage, and Jerry Chun Shing Lee, who pleaded guilty to spy charges, and former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Ron Hanson, who this week was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying.\n\nOthers spies include State Department official Candace Claiborne, who was convicted of passing information to Chinese intelligence in exchange for cash and gifts; FBI employee Kun Shan \u201cJoey\u201d Chun, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to providing China with restricted and sensitive information; and Glenn Duffie Shriver, recruited while studying in Shanghai and arrested in 2010 while applying for CIA employment at the behest of the Chinese Ministry of State Security.\n\n\u201cAs [counterintelligence] professionals know all too well, however, no matter how many spies are caught, others always remain at liberty,\u201d Mr. Kelton said.\n\nThe Chinese are following the ancient strategist Sun Tzu\u2019s dictum that knowledge of the enemy can be obtained only from people.\n\nChina, however, has added a caveat to that strategy. China is using \u201cblended\u201d intelligence attacks that combine traditional human spying with cyberespionage and other technical spying.\n\n\u201cThe PRC has launched a covert assault on the U.S. across the full spectrum of intelligence activities,\u201d Mr. Kelton said. \u201cThat campaign, which has inflicted considerable damage on us, to include theft of sensitive government, trade and industrial secrets, has featured seemingly myriad Chinese cyberattacks, principally by the People\u2019s Liberation Army 3rd Department (3PLA), on U.S. government and private-sector organizations.\u201d\n\nSimultaneously, Beijing is using traditional intelligence collection by legal Chinese travelers and visitors to the United States and is recruiting Americans with access to government secrets.\n\n\u201cThis Chinese intelligence threat is only now beginning to garner the attention it deserves,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the past, U.S. government policies regarded the communist regime in Beijing as less threatening than the Soviet and later Russian spy assault.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Chinese intelligence threat has, until recently, received less attention from U.S. counterintelligence organizations, entities that are, without exception, never resource-rich,\u201d Mr. Kelton said.\n\nThe damage extends beyond economic losses.\n\n\u201cAs indicated in the charging documents of some of those Americans arrested for betraying our country, their provision of classified information to Beijing has resulted in lives lost among those who worked with us in opposition to the evil, oppressive PRC regime,\u201d Mr. Kelton said. \u201cThey were, and are, heroes in the fight for freedom.\u201d\n\nSTILWELL: U.S. UPS PRESSURE ON CHINA\n\nDavid Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said this week that the Trump administration is stepping up pressure on China over its mass repression of ethnic Uighurs in western China.\n\nOver 1 million Uighurs are interned in a concentration camps in Xinjiang province \u2014 called \u201coccupied East Turkistan\u201d by Uighurs \u2014 as part of alleged counterterrorism operations by China. Mr. Stilwell said intelligence on the issue, along with testimony from camp survivors, has revealed a dire situation for the Uighur majority there.\n\nAmong the options being considered are economic sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the repression and Chinese technology companies that are engaged in electronic surveillance of the Muslim Uighurs.\n\n\u201cThere is action going on. This is the next step,\u201d Mr. Stilwell told reporters at the United Nations headquarters in New York, adding that the diplomatic \u201cwater temperature has been rising to date.\u201d Mr. Stilwell declined to telegraph what specific measures will be taken.\n\nOn China\u2019s use of American surveillance technology, Mr. Stilwell said the Trump administration has notified U.S. companies to avoid selling products that can be used for repression.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to be complicit in something like this,\u201d he said.\n\nTestimony from Uighur escapees showed that the Chinese are monitoring phone calls and financial transactions in what Mr. Stilwell called an intrusive security posture. He confirmed that recent video images of shackled and blindfolded Uighurs being loaded onto trains appears authentic.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government believes the video is authentic, and they located it somewhere near the city of Kashgar,\u201d he said. \u201cThis activity is happening in that area still.\u201d\n\nChina has denied its campaign against the Uighurs is repression and sought to compare the mass incarcerations to the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nMr. Stilwell rejected the comparison.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s Xinjiang, and they\u2019re trying to link that with Guantanamo,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t take a Ph.D. to see the difference in scale, scope and everything related to the two facilities, the two activities.\u201d\n\nChina is \u201crunning out of explanations as this evidence continues to grow,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Stilwell also warned about China\u2019s military buildup during recent congressional testimony.\n\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s military modernization continues at a breakneck pace,\u201d he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n\u201cIts exercises in the region are increasingly complex and clearly intended not only to deter U.S. efforts to sustain our forward presence in the region, but to signal to other countries, and to the authorities on Taiwan, that they are under direct threat. Beijing\u2019s conduct is at odds with its public narrative of a \u2018peaceful rise.\u2019\u201d\n\nCHINA SELLING DRONES ONLINE\n\nChina\u2019s past arms proliferation activities have included providing Pakistan with nuclear warhead designs, selling advanced cruise missiles to Iran and providing North Korea with mobile intercontinental ballistic missile launchers.\n\nRecently, China has begun selling unmanned aerial vehicles \u2014 one of the cutting-edge weapons used by foreign militaries and even adopted by some terrorist groups for attacks.\n\nChina\u2019s Alibaba, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, is offering for sale China\u2019s YZ-8 drone, ostensibly for agricultural use.\n\nThe cost? A YZ-8 can be procured for $250,000 and can be purchased using a Visa or Mastercard credit card or through Western Union.\n\nAlibaba describes the YZ-8 as a fixed-wing \u201cSpray Airdrop Surveillance Inspection Multi-Purpose UAV.\u201d\n\nThe drone can fly for up to 30 hours and carry a payload of up to 110 pounds.\n\nThe YZ-8 appears to be a civilian version of China\u2019s Harrier Hawk II Air Sniper, a military drone that is equipped with a synthetic aperture radar for radar imaging missions.\n\n\u201cYou need go no further than the Alibaba webpage to see how easily China proliferates drone technology that could easily be converted into a medium-range cruise missile,\u201d said Rick Fisher, a China military affairs expert.\n\nMr. Fisher, with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, said the YZ-8 \u201ccan be easily converted into a slow cruise missile with a range of 2,400 kilometers.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
