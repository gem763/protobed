The industry expects that mobility platforms will need about 900 licenses a year, which will cost around W60 billion (US$1=W1,181).\n\nSupposing the ride-sharing businesses pay an estimated W5 billion in license rental a year, the government needs to come up with the other W55 billion by itself. \"We will be able to raise the funds by various means after finding out the demands of start-up businesses,\" the ministry said. It denied that the money will come from taxpayers but did not explain where it will find it.\n\nThe revised regulations do not specify whether it is legal to operate businesses with hire cars, which means it is effectively illegal. This is a big blow to TADA, which uses 1,000 hire vans to get around the current regulations.\n\n\"We considered allowing service based on hire cars, but protest from the taxi industry was so strong that we had to exclude it,\" Kim admitted.\n\nCritics suspect that the government has its eyes firmly on conventional taxi drivers' votes in the upcoming general election. The government insisted that will not outlaw TADA immediately, so until the relevant laws are revised TADA exists in legal limbo.", "description": "Gov't Slaps More Red Tape on Ride-Sharing Apps", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/07/18/2019071801294_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-18"}
