More than 800 suspected IS detainees escaped the Ayn Issa camp in northern Syria on Sunday, Kurdish forces said in a statement, five days into Turkey's military incursion into norther Syria. Jelal Ayaf, co-chair of Ayn Issa camp, told local media that 859 people \"successfully escaped\" the section of the camp holding foreign nationals. He also said attacks were already being carried out by \"sleeper cells\" that had emerged from inside the camp, which holds IS prisoners, internally displaced persons and families or affiliates of IS fighters. While some escapees could be recaptured, he described the situation in the camp as \"very volatile.\" CNBC could not independently verify the numbers. At least 10,000 Islamic State prisoners are in camps across northeastern Syria, according to Kurdish and U.S. officials. About 2,000 are foreign fighters and the rest Iraqi and Syrian. As Turkish jets bombard the area, many of the personnel responsible for containing those prisoners are being forced to the front to defend themselves or their families, Kurdish forces say.\n\n'They are forced to defend their families'\n\nThe news comes as the Turkish military expands its offensive into Syria, which began shortly after President Donald Trump announced a U.S. troop withdrawal from the Turkish-Syrian border area and handed responsibility for the area \u2014 and the IS fighters within it \u2014 to Ankara. Turkey views the Kurdish fighters as a security threat and indistinguishable from a separate Kurdish group that has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey. Trump's move triggered swift condemnation from Republicans and Democrats for what critics say is leaving the Kurdish forces to fend for themselves alone against a Turkish onslaught aimed at clearing them from the region. The Syrian Kurds suffered heavy losses fighting alongside the U.S. in the counter-IS campaign.\n\nKurdish forces and activists say more than 100 people have died from Turkish artillery fire and airstrikes, while some 130,000 people have already been displaced, according to the UN. Trump has defended his decision as part of his drive to end U.S. engagement in Middle Eastern wars, but security experts and aid groups warn of an IS revival and a humanitarian disaster. Gen. Mazloum Kobani, commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces, told NBC News in an interview last week that guarding the IS prisoners in Syria is now a \"second priority.\" \"All their families are located in the border area,\" he said of the Kurdish forces normally tasked with securing the detention camps. \"So they are forced to defend their families.\" \"This is a very big problem,\" Kobani told NBC. \"Nobody has helped in this regard.\"\n\n'IS 2.0'\n\nIn a move that highlights the Kurds' desperation, the Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 the predominantly Kurdish collection of U.S.-backed militia groups that battled IS and have come to govern northern Syria \u2014 announced they have struck a deal with the Iranian- and Russian-backed government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. \"An agreement has been reached with the Syrian government \u2014 whose duty it is to protect the country's borders and preserve Syrian sovereignty \u2014 for the Syrian Army to enter and deploy along the Syrian-Turkish border to help the SDF stop this aggression\" by Turkey, the Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement Sunday.", "description": "At least 10,000 Islamic State prisoners are in camps across northeastern Syria, according to Kurdish and U.S. officials.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106177713-1570825495130gettyimages-1175345568.jpeg?v=1570825521", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
