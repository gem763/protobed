Root has undergone batting sessions with Josh Varley, the head coach of Sheffield Collegiate, as he hones his game ahead of the two Test series in New Zealand next month.\n\n\u201cHe's actually younger than me,\u201d Root said. \u201cBut from being 12 and 13 years old, we threw balls at each other all day at Abbeydale. We've been doing a bit of work together. Not so much technical stuff. There's been a lot of throwing. I've also been down to Denstone College to use the facilities there.\n\n\u201cSo just throwing a few ideas around and getting different points of view, ways of looking at things is sometimes nice. It's outside of the bubble, if you like. I do some brilliant work with Thorpey (Graham Thorpe). And guys like Ramps (Mark Ramprakash) when he was involved. But every now and again, when you are out of it, it's quite nice to go to other people and for someone like Josh, it is almost helping develop a young coach, trying to give him confidence. An opportunity to help me along the way will hopefully help him.\u201d", "description": "England Test captain Joe Root has turned to an old friend to help his batting as he prepares for the Test series in New Zealand.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000209276189-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7FAR-Mr95yUA9tz5mE9Efrw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
