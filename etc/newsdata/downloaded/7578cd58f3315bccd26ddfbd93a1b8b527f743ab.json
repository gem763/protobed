The winner of the home and away aggregate series will represent Canada in next year's CONCACAF Champions League.\n\nBecause Montreal did not concede an all-important away goal, Wilmer Cabrera's men need a win, a draw, or a one-goal defeat in which they score a goal in the second leg in order to hoist the franchise's fourth Voyageurs Cup.\n\n\"We were very organized, we were very solid,\" said Cabrera, who improved to 2-3-0 as Impact coach. \"We didn't make too many silly mistakes. The fact that we cut those mistakes out allowed our players to be more comfortable with the ball.\"\n\nFamiliar foes\n\nIt is the third meeting between Toronto and Montreal in a Canadian Championship final, with each team winning once before.\n\nThe three-time defending Canadian champs Toronto FC came into the game full of confidence riding a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions (5-0-4).\n\nBut it was the home team that completely dominated the first half of play at Saputo Stadium, and much of the second.\n\nChance after chance came to nothing in the first quarter hour until Piatti got the breakthrough from distance in the 17th minute. The Argentine, fully recovered from a recent adductor injury, one-touched a ball from Saphir Taider and fired a rocket into the back of the net from 25 yards out.\n\nToronto's only real opportunity of the half belonged to Jacob Shaffelburg, from Port Williams, N.S., whose volley from inside the penalty area required Clement Diop to make a dramatic one-handed outstretched save \u2014 one of four stops for the Impact backup goalkeeper.\n\nSearching for a spark\n\nLooking for that away goal, TFC coach Greg Vanney added firepower for the second half, subbing leading scorers Alejandro Pozuelo and Jozy Altidore into the game.\n\n\"Our losses of possession were deadly for us in the first half,\" said Vanney, whose team plays LAFC on Saturday. \"Too many straight passes and they were jumping on them. It was setting off their transitions, which is always something they've been good at. For us, it was getting that organized.\n\n\"We wanted to get a goal and we didn't. But 1-0 is doable for us. It didn't get away from us tonight. Now we go home and we know what we have to do.\"\n\nThe visitors controlled more of the ball in the second half but Montreal came closest to scoring again.\n\nA wide-open Piatti nearly got on the end of a Taider free kick in the box in the 52nd minute. On the very next play, winger Lassi Lappalainen lobbed a ball over 'keeper Alex Bono from a few yards out but his shot went just wide.\n\nMontreal is now undefeated at home in the Canadian Championship in 14 consecutive matches (9-0-5) dating back to April 2011.\n\n\"We really put ourselves in a good position for Wednesday,\" said Piette. \"I was excited to play today, and I'm even more excited for the second leg following today's result. Honestly, I just want to lift that trophy over my head on Wednesday in Toronto.\"", "description": "A wonder goal by Ignacio Piatti gave the Montreal Impact a 1-0 victory over rivals Toronto FC in the first leg of the Canadian Championship final on Wednesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5289258.1568857340!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/soc-mls-toronto-fc-impact-20190918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
