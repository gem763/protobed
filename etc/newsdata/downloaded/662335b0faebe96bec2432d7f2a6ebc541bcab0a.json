The 37-year-old has a career FG completion percentage of 81.4 but has been fairly shaky from 50 yards or more (13/20) throughout his career.\n\nLooks like kicker Mike Nugent will be No. 2. pic.twitter.com/pvElZXNEYD \u2014 Mike Reiss (@MikeReiss) October 3, 2019\n\nThe 14-year veteran played in three games for the Raiders last season before being placed on IR with a hip injury. During those games, Nugent went 6-for-6 on field goals and 4-for-5 on extra points.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat curious the Pats decided to go with Nugent, a former second-round pick, as one of his main problems as a kicker was missing extra points, the same issue that was plaguing Gostkowski (four misses) this season.\n\nIn his last extended stay in the NFL, Nugent missed six extra points in only 13 games and was so much of a liability that Vegas sportsbooks were setting odds on whether or not he\u2019d miss the extra try.\n\n2014-18 Mike Nugent 89-for-109 FGs (81.7%)\n\n85-for-98 on FGs less than 50 yards (86.7%)\n\n54-for-59 on FGs less than 40 yards (91.5%)\n\n129-for-139 PATs (92.8%) Gostkowski 166/185 FGs (89.7%)\n\n153/166 on FGs < 50 yards (92.2%)\n\n107/110 on FGs < 40 yads (97.3%)\n\n254/264 PATs (96.2%) \u2014 Michael Hurley (@michaelFhurley) October 3, 2019\n\nGiven that, it\u2019s possible the Patriots will go for it more on fourth down and attempt more two-point conversions with Nugent kicking instead of Gostkowski.\n\nThough his teams are 0-5 in the playoffs, Nugent has played in big games before and had a very successful career at Ohio State that included a 2002 BCS National Championship.\n\nRegardless, it seems as if Nugent will have a short leash as the Patriots also signed former Chargers\u2019 kicker Younghoe Koo to their practice squad.\n\nShould Nugent falter, Koo would seemingly get the next shot at replacing Gostkowski.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "Nugent played in three games for the Raiders last season before being placed on IR with a hip injury and went 6-for-6 on FGs and 4-for-5 on extra points.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-627063702-e1570130252789.jpg?fit=798%2C532"}
