I put in my notice, sold my things, packed a 70-liter backpack, and traveled to New Zealand on a whim.\n\nThree years and 11 countries later, I still haven\u2019t gone back. My partner, Matt, and I now live in a 13-year-old GMC Savana named Birdie, and while it might not offer us daily showers and Netflix, it\u2019s everything we need.\n\nTake a look inside our beloved house on wheels below, and see how we eat, sleep, work, and travel inside our trusty van.\n\nMy fascination started with the 1995 minivan I bought in New Zealand. Despite its musty bed and the many tourists who had slept in it, waking up in new places each day was a thrill. A couple months after I met my partner Matt, who had also quit an office job to travel, he moved in.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nWe traveled around the island together for months before our visas expired, and then we decided to sell the van and continue our adventures in Australia. There, we bought a four-wheel-drive with a rooftop tent and lived in it for almost a year.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nHaving been on the \u201cvan life\u201d circuit for two years already, I knew exactly what I was looking for by the time I returned to the States to search for something more long-term. When I saw this former government surveillance van sitting on the lot, I knew it was the one.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nMy carpenter-extraordinaire father spent two months gutting the interior and turning it into a homey haven on wheels. With my vision and his handiwork, this retired work van got a second chance at life.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nBirdie, as we named our vehicle, has now taken Matt and me through 15 states and two Canadian provinces since its maiden voyage in February 2019.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nWe\u2019ve tried all kinds of odd jobs on the road, from vineyard work and painting houses to cleaning hotels. When we\u2019re on the move, we make a living off my freelance writing and Matt\u2019s photography.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nI love to sample the local caf\u00e9 and coffee shop offerings, so I tend to work from whatever window seat is closest to an electrical outlet. On days when I do work from the van, I have a 15-gigabyte data plan and a laptop car charger to support it.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nWe\u2019ve always been budget travelers. The less we spend, the less we have to work. Our monthly budget is about $2,000 for the two of us, including fuel, groceries, and the occasional day pass at the gym (for showers, mostly).\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nBirdie was designed as meticulously as a tiny house. Everything inside has a purpose \u2014 or several \u2014 and a unique place. I even measured the kettle, shoes, and books before the shelves were installed.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nWe have about 25 square feet of storage space under our custom-cut foam mattress, which is where we keep our clothes, two portable chairs, a tent, and hiking gear.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nOur kitchen space is only slightly bigger than our bed and features a gravity-fed water system that starts with two PVC pipes (each holding seven gallons) on the roof and ends with a copper mixing bowl that drains into a five-gallon bucket underneath.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nWhen it\u2019s warm enough, we hang our portable Coleman solar shower \u2014 a five-gallon bag painted black, essentially \u2014 in a nearby tree. Our trusty collapsible bucket can be a handy makeshift washing machine and the empty coffee can under the passenger seat is used for late-night pees.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nOur refrigerator is an insulated tote from Trader Joe\u2019s. Because our budgets don\u2019t factor in takeout, we typically make at least one trip to the supermarket per day. We have a two-burner butane stove, a frying pan, and two saucepans to work with, and we plan our meals accordingly.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nBirdie might require more maintenance than the average commuter car, but the freedom to take our house anywhere is worth the extra repairs. So far, we\u2019ve driven from New York City through the Southwest, up the Pacific Coast \u2026\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\n\u2026 and through part of Canada, which is where we are now.\n\nsource Matthew Picking\n\nPerhaps this old van will even see another continent someday, but until then, there\u2019s plenty left of North America to explore.", "description": "Business Insider - Take a look inside our beloved home on wheels \u2014\u00a0and see how we eat, sleep, work, and travel inside a van..
