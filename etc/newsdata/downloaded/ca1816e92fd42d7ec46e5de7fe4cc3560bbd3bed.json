But there are good reasons to remain cautious.\n\n1. Change takes time\n\nOne of the UK's best-selling cars is the all-electric Tesla Model 3. But its success doesn't change the fact that only about 1.1% of new cars sold this year are electric, and that the market for used electric vehicles hardly exists.\n\nAs it takes most UK drivers anywhere between one and 15 years to change their vehicles, many of us won't be thinking about buying an electric model any time soon.\n\nTarget dates for ending the sale of new petrol or diesel vehicles Year Countries 2025 Norway 2030 Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Slovenia, Netherlands 2035 Denmark 2040 UK, Sri Lanka, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada 2050 Costa Rica\n\nBigger changes are needed. We will need many more places for charging electric vehicles, for example. And because fuel tax is an important source of income for the government - and electric vehicle users pay lower taxes - changes to the tax system may be required.\n\nIndividuals and businesses also need to be convinced that electric vehicles suit their needs. This is perhaps the hardest part.\n\nThe government aims to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2040, a target criticised by MPs who want the change made by 2030.\n\nBut even if these goals are met, it is likely to be decades before the most common vehicles on our roads are electric ones.\n\n2. Limited choice\n\nThe number of vans on the UK's roads is increasing faster than any other type of vehicle, in part because of the rapid growth in online shopping\n\nSmall e-vans are already available and the choice on offer is only likely to increase.\n\nIt is difficult to compare prices for diesel and e-vans. However, it can be significantly more expensive to lease an electric version of a popular van, than a diesel one. This is likely to mean that electric vans remain unaffordable for many small firms and self-employed delivery drivers for some time.\n\nUK road transport emissions, by mode, 2016 (MtCO2)\n\nThere is more choice for those looking for a new car, but electric vehicles are disproportionately aimed at the higher end of the market. Few all-electric models are available for less than \u00a320,000, and buying a new Tesla Model 3 costs about \u00a337,000.\n\nPrices are likely to continue to fall and operating an electric vehicle tends to be cheaper than a petrol or diesel equivalent. But the higher upfront costs may stop many drivers from buying electric vehicles for the foreseeable future, even when a vibrant second-hand market emerges.\n\n3. Backing the right technology\n\nThere are rapid developments in battery and charging technology, but this is causing deep uncertainty. Which charging technologies will become the gold standard?\n\nThis is a particular problem for people living in apartment blocks, or houses without a private parking space. Should they expect charging to be available at bollards or lamp posts along their street?\n\nPerhaps home charging will not be as important as it is now. Should drivers use facilities at petrol stations, their office or in empty supermarket car parks at night?\n\nOther options being explored include induction pads embedded in major roads, which charge cars as they drive over them.\n\nBBC Briefing is a mini-series of downloadable guides to the big issues in the news, with input from academics, researchers and journalists. It is the BBC's response to audiences demanding better explanation of the facts behind the headlines.\n\nThis uncertainty about which approach will become most common slows down private sector investment in charging infrastructure. It also makes the role of local authorities more difficult.\n\nActing too soon could mean betting on the wrong horse. Waiting too long could encourage more people into hybrid vehicles, which are less dependent on charging infrastructure, but still use fossil fuels.\n\n4. Who will pay?\n\nEven when a standard design for charging emerges, the age-old question of who will pay for installing it remains.\n\nIt is widely assumed that the private sector will build, operate and maintain charging infrastructure in the UK.\n\nBut businesses have long been slow to get involved, in part because profit margins remain small and government has heavily subsidised the development of charging points. This is slowly changing: BP and Shell have taken over market leaders Chargemaster and Newmotion, and Tesla is actively rolling out its own charging network at motorway service stations.\n\nMore like this\n\nYet the question remains: how large should the government's contribution be in future infrastructure development?\n\nIf getting people into electric vehicles is for the public good, should local government pay for charging points in areas where demand is too low to offer healthy profits?\n\nAnd how should investment compare with that in social care, libraries or safe cycling routes, especially when local authority budgets remain as tight as they currently are?\n\n5. The zero-carbon fantasy\n\nEven 100% electric vehicles are not a zero-carbon solution.\n\nThey may not produce the usual exhaust pipe emissions, but even if all of the UK's electricity was from renewable sources, there would still be an environmental cost.\n\nSourcing the minerals used for batteries, dismantling batteries which have deteriorated, and building and delivering vehicles to customers worldwide all involve substantial CO2 emissions. It is impossible to break all of the links.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nElectric vehicles are a crucial part of the UK's attempts to drastically reduce transport's emissions. Yet they are no panacea.\n\nA large shift away from motorised vehicles is the only way to fundamentally reduce transport's contribution to climate change, however hard and politically unpalatable that may be.\n\nRead more reports inspired by the BBC Briefing on energy.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nTim Schwanen is a professor of transport studies and geography.
