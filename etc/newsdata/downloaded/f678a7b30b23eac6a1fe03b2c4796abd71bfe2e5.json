Then he was shot dead.", "language": "en", "text": "Abdul Samad Amiri, an Afghan human rights defender, with his daughter. He was found Thursday shot to death. (Family photo)\n\nThe last time Musa Mahmodi saw his friend alive, the young human rights defender said he knew his life was at risk.\n\nIt was August in Kabul, and Abdul Samad Amiri, 28, had recently traveled the 10 hours west to the capital from his home province of Ghor, where persistent threats from the Taliban and local militias had created an increasingly volatile environment.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Taliban was everywhere there, and I was so scared,\u2019\u201d Mahmodi, Amiri\u2019s former boss at Afghanistan\u2019s governmental Independent Human Rights Commission, recalled Amiri saying about his journey.\n\nWeeks later, on the same road, Amiri was found shot dead, according to Wardak province police spokesman Hekmatullah Durani. The Taliban has not yet commented publicly on the attack, but Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Friday the militants were responsible for his killing and that it amounted to \u201ca crime against humanity.\u201d\n\nAmiri\u2019s violent death last week came amid a spike in Taliban violence in the days since the top U.S. negotiator in peace talks with the group said the two sides had reached an agreement \u201cin principle.\u201d On Saturday evening, President Trump unexpectedly called off the talks, saying in a tweet he had canceled plans to \u201csecretly meet\u201d with Ghani and Taliban leaders at Camp David on Sunday over concerns of escalating violence, including a bombing that killed a U.S. service member in Kabul on Thursday.\n\nTaliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted on Sunday that an agreement between U.S. and Taliban officials had been \u201cfinalized\u201d in recent days and the Qatari government planned to announce it, seeming to contradict Trump\u2019s claims. \u201cPresident Trump's tweets have been unbelievable and certainly damaged his credibility,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn recent days, Afghan officials and civilians have expressed concerns that a U.S. deal with the Taliban that excluded the Afghan government would fail to protect civilians and security forces in the event of a U.S. troop drawdown.\n\nAmiri\u2019s killing left his community in Afghanistan reeling over the loss of someone they said was a devoted family man and an energetic, selfless advocate for justice \u2014 someone who represented the best of what his generation had to offer.\n\nAs acting head of the commission\u2019s office in Ghor, Amiri was aware of the risks his work posed. The commission promotes women\u2019s rights and religious freedoms and training defense forces and religious scholars in human rights. He had worked extensively on reports about civilian killings in his home region and was responsible for looking into incidents suspected to be perpetrated by the Taliban.\n\nThat work made him a target of the militant group, which governed Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and has been fighting the Afghan government and allied forces ever since. The Taliban's rule was marked by a repressive interpretation of Islamic law that restricted the rights of women and minorities.\n\nFour members of the same commission where Amiri worked have been killed in recent years, including a former head of the same office in Ghor.\n\nAnd just last week Amnesty International reported that human rights defenders in Afghanistan are \u201cunder intensifying attacks from both the authorities and armed groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most dangerous moments to be a human rights activist in Afghanistan,\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s deputy South Asia director Omar Waraich said in a statement at the time, pointing to others who had been targeted for their work.\n\nAfter Amiri\u2019s death, Amnesty said his killing was \u201ca war crime.\u201d\n\nAmiri had recently considered moving to the United States, Mahmodi said, but had changed his mind, compelled to instead continue his investigations in Ghor and support his sisters\u2019 dreams of graduating from university.\n\nIn a phone call from India, where she is studying for a master\u2019s degree, his younger sister Atifa said that she was in shock from the news of his death.\n\nBoys\u2019 education is often prioritized over girls\u2019 in Afghanistan. But Amiri helped her with chores so she could take college prep courses, she said, then supported her when she decided to pursue further education abroad.\n\n\u201cHe was not only a brother, he was a friend and supporter,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t be happy anymore. I am hopeless.\u201d\n\nHe was recently married, and his wife had just given birth to a baby girl. In a photo his sister shared on social media, he cradles his daughter close to his face, beaming with pride.\n\nAmiri\u2019s killing and a spate of attacks in Kabul in recent days have left civilians here on edge. Last week, the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack on a Kabul compound housing foreigners that left 16 people, mainly Afghan civilians, dead. On Thursday, the group bombed a busy traffic circle in the capital, killing 10 Afghan civilians and two NATO troops, including the American.\n\nAmiri belonged to the minority Hazara ethnic group, a frequent target of Taliban attacks, making him an even more likely target. In Kabul, members of the Hazara community, most of whom practice Shia Islam, are bracing for an upcoming holiday, fearing mosques and public gatherings could be targeted.\n\nMahmodi said that in his role as an impartial human rights investigator, Amiri would often attend to the immediate aftermath of serious crimes, risking his own life to ensure justice for the victims. \u201cHe was the first to send a report and call an investigator and say \u2018OK, this happened,\u2019\u201d Mahmodi said.\n\nAnd he took notice of worrying incidents that others often overlooked, launching, for example, an investigation into an uptick of women\u2019s suicides in his province.\n\n\u201cHis investigations were thorough, his work was very good quality, his reports were credible,\u201d Mahmodi said. \u201cEverything he was doing was very good, and he was also so personally dedicated.\u201d\n\nAn ardent reader and excellent student, he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from Kabul University before pursuing a career in human rights advocacy, said Khodayar Naiebzada, a childhood friend.\n\nIn his hometown, Naiebzada said, \u201cthe people were proud of him and counted on him.\u201d\n\nIn a Facebook post last week, Amiri shared a photo of himself standing on a mountain top in Ghor. In the caption below, he reflected on how much he\u2019d grown in the seven years since he graduated from university. Through his work and travels, he said, he had gained a better understanding of \u201cthe trauma of 40 years of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that we have obligations to our mother country, and whatever I do for my country, though insufficient to what I owe, makes me happy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDespite the difficulties, I owe my life to this land and will work for its betterment so long as I live.\u201d\n\nHe was killed shortly after.\n\nRead more\n\nTheirs was the \u2018purest love.\u2019 Then a suicide bombing changed everything.\n\nThe Taliban tried to wipe out Afghanistan\u2019s film industry. This is what survived.\n\nFor Afghan women, competing in the Olympics is only part of the struggle\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Abdul Samad Amiri fought for justice despite the risks, his friends and colleagues said.", "authors": ["Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Worldviews Reporter", "Sharif Hassan", "Reporter Covering Afghanistan", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Z1of2ztjaqDjQdKKyU6CWX9uXMw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H6LGHTGRWAI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
