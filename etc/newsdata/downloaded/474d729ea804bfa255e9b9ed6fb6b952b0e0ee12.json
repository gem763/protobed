He told reporters on the White House lawn Monday that the Taliban are \u201cdead, as far as I am concerned,\u201d and he asserted that the U.S. military and its allies have \u201chit the Taliban harder in the last four days than they\u2019ve been in over 10 years.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear what military operations Mr. Trump was referring to, and some analysts said the year of closed-door diplomacy and the chaotic events of the past four days have done little to cut into the Taliban\u2019s power.\n\nCritics say the talks, which collapsed just as Mr. Trump said he was prepared to host leaders of the Taliban and the Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani at Camp David, have left the U.S. and its allies in a weaker position and perhaps motivated the Taliban to renew and deepen its ties with al Qaeda.\n\nSEE ALSO: More Americans are about to die, Taliban warns\n\n\u201cThe Taliban are as strong as they have been at any time since October 2001, when the war began. Militarily, they have momentum. Every few weeks, it seems another district has fallen,\u201d said former Defense Department official Michael Rubin. \u201cDiplomatically, the decision to allow the Taliban to open an office in Qatar granted them unprecedented legitimacy. So too did the U.S. decision to press forward with negotiations without the Taliban recognizing the legitimacy of Afghanistan\u2019s elected government.\n\n\u201cThey won diplomatic legitimacy, demoralized Afghanistan\u2019s elected government and convinced ordinary Afghans that momentum was on their side,\u201d said Mr. Rubin, now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThey are no worse off today than when they started talks. The United States cannot say the same thing.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump tweeted over the weekend that he canceled the Camp David summit in the wake of a terrorist attack in Kabul last week that resulted in the fourth American death in past three weeks. Administration officials said they would recall the U.S. envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, effectively ending the chance of a comprehensive peace deal in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to get out, but we\u2019ll get out at the right time,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday.\n\nMr. Ghani, whose government has complained repeatedly about being excluded from the direct U.S.-Taliban negotiations, expressed similar sentiments Monday but added that the talks were inherently flawed from the beginning because the Taliban had steadfastly rejected a binding cease-fire.\n\n\u201cNegotiation without a cease-fire is not possible,\u201d he said.\n\nMore violence on horizon\n\nMr. Trump said Taliban officials realized they had made a major miscalculation in staging an attack at such a delicate diplomatic moment, but there was little direct evidence that the sudden breakdown in negotiations changed the radical Islamist movement\u2019s approach. Taliban leaders on Monday promised a new wave of violence that would result in more American deaths in what has become the longest U.S. military campaign in history.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to more losses to the U.S.,\u201d Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. \u201cU.S. credibility will be affected, its anti-peace stance will be exposed to the world, losses to lives and assets will increase.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban have the capacity to make good on their threat, military analysts said, but remain unable to capture and hold major urban centers because of the presence of 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A U.S.-led invasion ousted the Taliban from Kabul in the wake of 9/11 over its ties to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist group.\n\nMr. Khalilzad\u2019s deal \u201cin principle\u201d with the Taliban reportedly would have withdrawn roughly 5,400 troops immediately and phase out the rest. In exchange, the Taliban would have guaranteed that the country would not be used as a base of operations for terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State and would enter talks with the Kabul government on a power-sharing deal.\n\nBut analysts said there was virtually no sign that the Taliban were willing to sever their relationship with al Qaeda.\n\n\u201cThe two are more intertwined now in ideology and personnel than they were a decade ago,\u201d Mr. Rubin said.\n\nThe Pentagon made clear Monday that it would increase operations inside Afghanistan to counter any Taliban attacks, underscoring that U.S. military involvement is far from over despite a year of grueling diplomacy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to sit still and let them carry out some self-described race to victory. That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of U.S. Central Command, told reporters Monday.\n\nThe most recent estimates show that at least 66 districts in Afghanistan are under Taliban control and 138 are under government control. Another 193 districts are contested and are the sites of bitter fighting between the two sides, according to The Long War Journal, a project of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nAbout 3.7 million Afghans are in districts under firm Taliban control, data show, and 13.6 million are living in contested areas.\n\nThe Taliban took credit Monday for two fresh attacks in the northeastern Takhar province and engaged in heavy gunbattles with government forces in the Khwaja Ghar district.\n\nA roadside bomb exploded in Kabul, though no one immediately claimed responsibility, according to The Associated Press.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s postponed presidential elections, now set for Sept. 28, could provide another tempting target for Taliban strikes.\n\nThe Taliban boasted in recent weeks that they believe their attacks \u2014 particularly those that kill Americans \u2014 were bluntly intended to give the group a stronger hand at the negotiating table. Although Mr. Trump flatly rejected that argument when he canceled peace talks, analysts say, the Taliban likely will stick with the strategy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the Taliban goal has changed that much over the years,\u201d said Seth Jones, director of the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cI think their broader objectives are, if they can do it, to govern as much of the country as they can, including Kabul.\n\n\u201cOne way of governing is if they can find ways to get the U.S. out of the country and put it on a trajectory where the U.S. presence is ultimately going down to zero,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cThe Taliban has shown no interest in disarming or demobilizing, and they haven\u2019t even shown an interest in really sitting down with the Afghan government. All of that to me suggests that their primary focus is to take the country, get U.S. forces out, and if they have to, to take it by military force.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Tom Howell contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
