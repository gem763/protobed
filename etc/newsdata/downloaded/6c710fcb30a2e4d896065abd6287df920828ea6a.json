It is, to say the least, a far cry from its lead\u2019s trademark satirical stunts.\n\nAs Eli Cohen, a 1960s operative who infiltrated Syria, became the Deputy Minister of Defense, and relayed key intel that aided his homeland during the Six-Day War, Cohen is the unquestionable calling card of this inspired-by-true-events tale. His impressively restrained and charismatic performance helps this suspenseful saga transcend its more conventional moments, turning it into a character study about an individual torn between two worlds and identities, and a gripping account of the sacrifices sometimes required by patriotic service.\n\nEli\u2019s covert work for Israel in Syria ended in tragic fashion, and The Spy foreshadows that fate from its opening 1965 moments, in which the bruised and blooded spy writes a final letter in a jail cell, and a rabbi, upon seeing that Eli is hesitating to sign it, remarks, \u201cYou do not know who you are.\u201d The struggle to maintain one\u2019s sense of self is paramount throughout the series, which\u2014after a bit of metaphorical moth-to-the-flame business that\u2019s shrewdly abandoned until the finale\u2014subsequently leaps six years backwards to find Eli working at a department store. Having participated in spy missions on behalf of the Israeli government when he was still living in Egypt, Cohen yearns to make a difference. After a number of attacks on the Israeli-Syrian border, he gets his chance when he\u2019s recruited by Mossad bigwig Dan Peleg (Noah Emmerich, returning to the espionage arena following The Americans).\n\nDan is initially uncertain about Eli, less because the man isn\u2019t capable but because his eagerness and confidence remind Dan of a former agent he put in harm\u2019s way, to horrific ends. Nonetheless, as evidenced by a jaunty sequence in which he learns to master the tricks of his intelligence trade, Eli proves a fast learner, and it\u2019s not long before he\u2019s sent to Buenos Aires to pose as Kamel Amin Thaabet, a wealthy Syrian businessman desperate to relocate to Damascus, the dearly beloved home of his father. Decked out in one dashing suit after another (be it striped or all-white), Cohen strikes a suave pose. And though his mustache invariably recalls that of Freddie Mercury\u2014a role the actor had coveted, before Rami Malek assumed it in Bohemian Rhapsody\u2014the iconic figure he most deliberately resembles here is 007.\n\nDeft as he is with the ladies, however, Eli is no James Bond, and Cohen refuses to render him merely a debonair playboy. The actor embodies his protagonist with outward poise but internal doubt, guilt and confusion, the latter born from the fact that the longer he remains undercover, the blurrier the line becomes between Eli and Kamel. Although one sometimes instinctively expects him to revert back to his clownish ways during action-oriented moments, the star fully inhabits Eli as a Zionist valiantly trying to hold onto who he is\u2014an endeavor complicated by the seductive wealth, influence and power possessed by his alter ego.\n\nRaff visualizes his hero\u2019s interior division via plentiful mirror imagery, and he underscores the differences between Eli's two milieus by bathing his Argentinian and Syrian exploits in bold colors and coating all Israeli-set scenes in hues that first look sun-bleached, and then downright ashen. Written letters and telegraph messages appear as text on environmental objects (or in the air), and the director delivers one canny split-screen\u2014during a heated soccer match\u2014to underscore the sense of home, togetherness, and unity that Eli craves, but is denied by his clandestine task. While far from aesthetically daring, The Spy employs such touches to emphasize its main character\u2019s increasingly fraught condition.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean The Spy doesn\u2019t fall into something of a clich\u00e9d rut; there are quite a few sequences (involving skulking around locked offices in order to photograph documents) that any casual genre fan will find familiar. The series thrives, however, when concentrating on Eli\u2019s specific methods of ingratiating himself with given marks, including Colonel Amin Al-Hafez (Waleed Zuaiter), who rises to the presidency after a bloody coup that Eli facilitates. Cohen\u2019s smooth-talking magnetism is vital to making these scenes work, as well as those in which he manipulates others in order to both glean insight into, and thwart, Syria\u2019s antagonistic plans, highlighted by a canny ruse involving a Colonel\u2019s wild nephew (Nassim Si Ahmed), a network of underground military facilities, and a gift of eucalyptus trees.\n\n\u201cThe world doesn\u2019t care if we live or die. And if we don\u2019t take care of ourselves, no one will,\u201d says a Mossad boss early in The Spy, and that bedrock belief is what drives both Dan and Eli to risk so much for their country, even if the potential costs are catastrophic. Raff\u2019s nuanced treatment of these two men isn\u2019t matched by his portrait of Nadia, whose suffering is empathetically detailed, but who never rises above being an archetypal miserable-abandoned wife. In asides about Nadia\u2019s relationship with her employer, the show can feel a bit sketchy, and that\u2019s even more pronounced whenever Colonel Al-Hafez\u2019s security chief Suidani (Alexander Siddig) is around, eyeing Eli suspiciously like every sharp right-hand man in spy-cinema history.\n\nLuckily, Cohen\u2019s multifaceted turn takes center stage throughout, keeping the focus squarely on Eli\u2019s battle within. As far as espionage games go, The Spy doesn\u2019t rewrite the rules, but it does suggest that its star is more than up to the dramatic leading-man challenge.\n\nFor more, listen to Sacha Baron Cohen on The Last Laugh podcast below.", "description": "The new Netflix series sees the funnyman flex his dramatic chops\u2014with thrilling results.", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1195,w_2125,x_500,y_268/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567425477/SPY_S1_Unit_00069_R_nzrcvp"}
