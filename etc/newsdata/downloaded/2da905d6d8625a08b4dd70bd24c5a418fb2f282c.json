Dunn's motorbike collided with a car near an RAF base in Northamptonshire on August 27.\n\nSacoolas should \"return to the U.K., cooperate with police and allow Harry\u2019s family to receive justice,\" Downing Street said Johnson told Trump.\n\nThe pair \"agreed to work together to find a way forward as soon as possible.\"\n\nTrump said it was \"a complex issue ... because we are talking about diplomatic immunity,\" according to remarks issued by the White House.\n\n\"You have two wonderful parents who lost their son, and the woman was driving on the wrong side of the road. That happens. I will not say it ever happened to me, but it did.\"\n\nHe added: \"We are going to speak to her [Sacoolas] very shortly and see if we can do something. It was an accident. It was a terrible accident ... We are going to speak to her and see what we can come up with, so that there can be healing. There is anger over it. It is a terrible incident. I understand the anger from the other side.\"\n\nTrump and Johnson also \"expressed their serious concern at Turkey\u2019s invasion of northeast Syria and the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe in the region.\"\n\nThe U.K. prime minister also voiced his \"disappointment\" at the U.S. announcement of tariffs against EU exports in the Airbus-Boeing dispute, \"which will harm a number of industries including Scotch Whisky. He pressed the president not to impose the tariffs.\u201d", "description": "UK PM and US president discuss road crash in which teenager was killed.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1170765144-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
