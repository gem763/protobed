Newsletter Sign-up The Ahsani brothers are set to be sentenced in April in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the department said. Mr. Hunter\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for March. A lawyer for the Ahsanis and a lawyer for Mr. Hunter declined to comment on the announcement. All three are U.K. nationals, according to the Justice Department. Unaoil was the subject of articles in 2016 by Australia\u2019s Fairfax Media, which alleged that the group had paid bribes on behalf of a number of prominent companies in the oil-and-gas sector. The reports prompted investigations by the U.S. and U.K. governments. The Serious Fraud Office, the U.K.\u2019s major economic crimes prosecutor, in 2018 launched criminal proceedings against two Unaoil units. U.K prosecutors have also brought charges against four individuals in connection with the Unaoil probe. A former Unaoil partner pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy charges in July. Three others are scheduled to begin trial in January. The Ahsani brothers, who are also nationals of Iran, hail from a wealthy Monacan family. Until 2011, Cyrus Ahsani was also a U.S. citizen, according to the Justice Department. A number of oil-and-gas companies have disclosed government investigations related to the Unaoil matter. Documents unsealed in the Texas court on Wednesday named Dutch oil-services firm SBM Offshore NV and a former Ohio-based subsidiary of British engineering company Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC as clients of Unaoil. Rolls-Royce in 2017 reached settlements totaling more than $800 million with U.S., U.K. and Brazilian prosecutors. The U.K. agreement covered conduct by Rolls-Royce and the Ohio-based subsidiary that was uncovered by the SFO\u2019s investigation into the company\u2019s use of Unaoil, according to the judge who approved the settlement. Later that year, SBM Offshore agreed to pay $238 million in a settlement with the Justice Department over bribery allegations spanning three continents. A representative of SBM Offshore didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. The company had previously reached a separate settlement with Dutch prosecutors.
