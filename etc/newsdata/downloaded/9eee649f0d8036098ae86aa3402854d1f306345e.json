(Time sure flies when it\u2019s a flat circle.) The \u201cBrave Red Maiden\u201d getup encouraged wearers to \u201cbe bold and speak your mind,\u201d even those of them who inhabited an \u201cupsetting dystopian future \u2026 where women no longer have a say.\u201d Just slip into your red mini dress, grab your aggressively ventilated cloak and your Hot Bonnet, the sales pitch whispered, seductively \u2014 Aunt Lydia be damned! Consumers, however, were not seduced: Many read the costume as \u201ca symbol of women\u2019s oppression, rather than an expression of women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d as Yandy observed in its apology statement.\n\nFor all the offense taken, Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, seemed mostly unruffled. Promoting her new book, The Testaments, on Late Night With Seth Meyers last week, Atwood laughed off the Brave Red Maiden as \u201csort of the \u2018French maid with the duster\u2019 version\u201d of her story, calmly agreeing with Meyers that Yandy had \u201csort of missed the point.\u201d When the host asked her if it frustrated her, to see someone skew the message of her work so badly, she replied, stone-faced: \u201cI have. A sense. Of humor.\u201d Punctuation absolutely necessary.", "description": "Margaret Atwood, author of \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u2019 talked to late night host Seth Meyers about Yandy\u2019s \u201csexy\u201d iteration of her characters\u2019 red robes and white bonnets. She does not seem overly perturbed by the get-ups.", "authors": ["Claire Lampen"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/03/03-margaret-atwood.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
