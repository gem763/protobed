Photo: Carly Hoogendyk\n\nKenice Mobley (@kenicemobley) is a New York\u2013based comedian who has been featured in the Limestone, Bridgetown, SF Sketchfest, and Women in Comedy festivals. She has appeared on Laughs on Fox and SiriusXM and produces Nothing Important, The Lab, and The Pasta Show in Brooklyn.\n\nThis week, Kenice and I talked about vulnerability in comedy, being overwhelmingly Italian, and Nicole Kidman\u2019s monologue in Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nMy whole life, I\u2019ve been told to prepare for the death of my mother, but no one taught me how to mentally handle her being 65 and having better tits than me \u2014 Kenice Mobley (@kenicemobley) September 11, 2019\n\nI was recently on vacation with my mom and I saw her naked and was swiftly furious. I mean, mine are fine, but she genuinely is genetically blessed. I asked her if I could tell people, and she laughed so I did it. My mother and I are probably too close. I have a lot of jokes about her. I love playing with the absurdity of caring more about my tits than the life of the woman who raised me.\n\nHas social media benefited you as a comic in any way?\n\nSocial media has been a great way to explore ideas, not necessarily the jokes themselves, that I want to talk about onstage. It is a daily exercise that helps me start writing. It\u2019s also been great for connecting with audiences after a show. I\u2019m not highly followed, so sometimes I feel like, Is this worth the time? So that a handful of people see it? But on good days, it\u2019s great!\n\nWhat made you pursue a comedy career?\n\nI loved comedy as a kid, but didn\u2019t really see a way into it. I went to film school, and thought that\u2019s the way I wanted to express myself and tell stories. When I was living in L.A., I went to an open mic with a friend, and I saw some truly terrible comedians and thought, I could do that better than them, and since then, I\u2019ve been trying to do that.\n\nLast week: I accept that I will die alone\n\n*Kisses one boy*: This is the beginning of a hoe phase that will be the focal point of my memiors \u2014 Kenice Mobley (@kenicemobley) March 14, 2019\n\nLike all my tweets, this one is based on a very real incident. I was walking home after a show and I was thinking about the kiss I had the day before. And I was like, Damn, I was good at that, I gotta do that all the time. Maybe I went a couple of months without kissing anyone, but that\u2019s all gonna change, this is the beginning of you kissing everyone. It wasn\u2019t, but it was a nice thought. I recently started playing with vulnerability in my comedy, talking about my loneliness, and so far it hasn\u2019t been the earth-shattering thing I worried it would be. Shockingly, no one has said, \u201cHaha, you do deserve the negative feelings you\u2019re experiencing, bitch!\u201d\n\nDo you think that vulnerability is necessary to be successful as a comic? Why or why not? What else do you think is necessary?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s always been necessary, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for everyone. Seinfeld made billions talking about airplane food and making distanced observations. So many people do self-deprecating humor, and that\u2019s what a lot of comedy is now, but that\u2019s not synonymous with vulnerable. When I say I\u2019m trying to be vulnerable, I mean I\u2019m trying to talk about the things that have the ability to cause me pain. God, I sound like I\u2019m trying to recreate Nanette in a tweet; not my intention! But it\u2019s one thing to make a joke about someone calling you ugly, it\u2019s another thing entirely to discuss grappling with issues around self-esteem and self-worth your whole life.\n\nYou produce The Pasta Show, a comedy show that serves a different homemade pasta dish each month. Tell us about that unique idea!\n\nThe Pasta Show existed well before I moved to New York. It was created by Brian Parise because he is overwhelmingly Italian and is a great cook. He makes the pasta, we banter about it before the show. I\u2019ve been a producer for two of the five years the show has been going. I did create and produce The Lab: A Very Black Experimental Comedy Show. I wanted to give black performers a chance to be weird in a space with technical resources. We\u2019re usually on the third Friday of every month.\n\nJust remembered that I auditioned for the 9th grade musical with a Fiona Apple song and a monologue from Eyes Wide Shut and, uh, why did adults let me do that? \u2014 Kenice Mobley (@kenicemobley) August 9, 2019\n\nI like this one because it is genuinely silly that no one intervened here. My attempts at dealing with weird horny-teenager energy were very transparent.\n\nOkay, the people need to know: Which song and which monologue?\n\n\u201cLove Ridden\u201d off the When the Pawn\u2026 album, and the monologue where Nicole Kidman describes a sailor she wanted desperately and would have blown up her marriage for.", "description": "Talking with New York-based comedian Kenice Mobley about vulnerability in comedy, writing funny tweets, and creating a space for black performers to be weird.", "authors": ["Taylor Garron"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-kenice-mobley.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
