That\u2019s not the typical wealthy client. Our goal is to slow that down.\u201d\n\nThat is a lesson for any affluent person, given the example of Bernie Madoff and the hundreds of friends who handed over money to him. More common, though, are investment tips and strategy suggestions floated by people at clubs or work.\n\nDeclare Your Next Milestone. Ask retired executives what they worry about, and it\u2019s likely to be some form of staying relevant. Joe McLean, who played professional basketball in Europe and is the managing partner of the wealth advisory firm Intersect Capital, said he counseled his clients to think in terms of milestones.\n\nThis accomplishes several things, Mr. McLean said. It allows players to fend off pitches or requests for money. \u201cIf you declare a milestone, what it allows you to do is focus on that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a milestone, money comes in and you have nothing to save it for.\u201d\n\nIt also keeps friends from asking for money or gives a player a way to easily brush off the request. \u201cYou can say, \u2018This is what I\u2019m trying to accomplish.\u2019\u201d\n\nLonger term, a milestone sets a player\u2019s sights on life beyond his sport. Mr. Thomas said he was always hesitant to define himself solely as a football player. During his playing career, he continued to have hobbies, but he also maintained his interest in real estate, which began in college.\n\nAs the end of his professional career approached, he looked to other players who had been successful in retirement. \u201cThe guys who had the most issues were the ones who didn\u2019t have something else to do,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing fishing every day sounds great, but if you don\u2019t have purpose and direction, you can struggle a bit.\u201d", "description": "Professional athletes may have big paychecks for a few years, but what happens when their careers end?
