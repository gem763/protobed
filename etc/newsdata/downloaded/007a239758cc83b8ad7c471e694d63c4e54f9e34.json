The 43-year-old was appointed by the League One club in May 2018 and led them to two Wembley appearances last season, the EFL Trophy and League One play-off finals - but they won neither.\n\nSaturday's 2-0 defeat at Lincoln leaves them sixth in League One, eight points behind leaders Ipswich.\n\nSunderland chairman Stewart Donald told his club's Twitter feed: \"This is a decision that has been made with a heavy heart.\n\n\"When we arrived at the club 18 months ago, we appointed Jack because we felt that he was the right man to take Sunderland forward over a number of years.\n\n\"Jack has worked extremely hard and has helped us achieve stability at the club, and I sincerely thank him for his efforts. I hope and believe that he will go on to have a successful career in management.\"\n\nAssistant manager James Fowler has been placed in temporary charge of first-team affairs and will take the team in Tuesday night's home game against Grimsby Town in the EFL Trophy", "description": "Sunderland have sacked manager Jack Ross.", "authors": ["Press Association", "Jim White", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212079992-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRNlN3RHrT0AMw9jzjHHSklUXe1u3g_52ZCby5E4bS5E.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
