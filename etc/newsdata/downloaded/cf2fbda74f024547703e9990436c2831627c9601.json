REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - German private sector activity shrank for the first time in 6-1/2 years in September as a manufacturing recession deepened unexpectedly and growth in the service sector lost momentum, a survey showed on Monday.\n\nMarkit\u2019s flash composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 49.1 from 51.7 in the previous month.\n\nIt is the first time since April 2013 that the reading fell below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
