Still, major indices closed near the highs of the session, and there\u2019s a sense some serious would-be buyers are champing at the bit and ready to pounce.\n\nKey Resistance Points S&P 500 Dow Jones Industrials NASDAQ Composite 2,938 26,485 8,039\n\n\n\nMarket breadth was better with very little downside volume, which underscored a sense of urgency for would-be buyers, especially when stocks they\u2019ve been spying began to lift off.\n\nNYSE\n\nAdvancers: 2.356\n\nDecliners: 605\n\nUp Volume: 2.22 billion\n\nDown Volume: 356 million\n\nNew Highs: 213\n\nNew Lows: 30\n\nNASDAQ\n\nAdvancers: 2,116\n\nDecliners: 1,017\n\nUp Volume: 1.19 billion\n\nDown Volume: 390 million\n\nNew Highs: 78\n\nNew Lows: 81\n\nChamping at the Bit\n\nThere are a ton of seriously oversold stocks making big moves in recent sessions, but that doesn\u2019t mean every big loser is a buy or will have a sustained bounce.\n\nIn fact, my biggest losers this year have all been from attempts to buy \u201coversold\u201d names too early.\n\nMomentum\n\nThe bottom line is big-time money managers have a great chance to catch the market and will naturally look to high-Beta momentum names that typically drive Communication Services and Technology sectors. The great news is that there is also value in many of those names as well.\n\nValue\n\nSpeaking of value, big moves in Industrials led by General Electric underscore the fact that there is a fair amount of bottom-fishing going on, as the top five movers in the sector have been underperformers:\n\nYear-to-Date\n\nGeneral Electric (GE): +21% (note: -70% over the past three years)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI): +10%\n\nFedEx (FDX): -1.4%\n\nQuanta Services (PWR): +12%\n\nAlaska Air Group (ALK): +1.5%\n\n*I\u2019m pounding the table on URI for long-term investors.\n\nS&P 500 Index +1.08% Communication Services (XLC) +1.94% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +0.99% Consumer Staples (XLP) +0.90% Energy (XLE) +1.40% Financials (XLF) +0.98% Health Care (XLV) +0.07% Industrials (XLI) +1.27% Materials (XLB) +1.23% Real Estate (XLRE) +0.83% Technology (XLK) +1.71% Utilities (XLU) +0.09%\n\nHere Comes the Fed Talking Heads\n\nFed officials were everywhere yesterday, and they have taken up their own causes and positions as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) gathering promises to be one of the most consequential Fed meetings in recent memory. Meanwhile, former NY Fed President William Dudley made a half-hearted attempt to clean up comments in the now infamous Bloomberg op-ed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t nearly good enough, and it suggests the Fed should have domain over the executive branch, with respect to policies and approach. Ironically, this same Fed stood by as President Obama ran up massive deficits and perhaps enabled by the printing of trillions of dollars. #Justsaying\n\nThe remarks I focused on the most were by NY Fed President John Williams, who laid out a great piece on why the Fed needed to be proactive with respect to deflation.\n\nHe had to walk back some of his comments. However, he reiterated his low inflation concerns yesterday at the Euromoney Real Return XIII: The Inflation-Linked Products Conference 2019, New York City; his remarks:\n\n(Low) Inflation Risks\n\nLow inflation is indeed the problem of this era. The current outlook of moderate growth, low unemployment, but stubbornly low inflation is a reflection of the broader economic picture\u2014the July rate adjustment an appropriate response to ease financial conditions and support the economy.\n\nHow the U.S. outlook evolves in the future is fundamentally tied to the fortunes of the economies around the world. As I look ahead, I\u2019m keeping a keen eye on all the data, both domestic and global, and the implications for our economy. With an uncertain outlook, vigilance and flexibility are essential for achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Persistently low inflation, heightened uncertainty, and global cross-currents make this a particularly challenging time for monetary policy, and my laser focus is on doing the best we can to support a strong economy and achieve our 2 percent inflation goal. -John Williams\n\nRetailers & Tariffs\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) held a retail conference, and for the most part, most participants had the same comments on the costs and the impact of tariffs. Essentially, their vendors and they will eat most of the costs of tariffs, including the fourth tranche.\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters (AEO)\n\nAEO is making progress to reduce exposure to Chinese tariffs through by partnering with vendors and diversifying geographic production capabilities. Management doesn\u2019t expect a material impact this year from the latest tranche (List 4) and says the impact will be manageable in 2020.\n\nBy the Way\u2026\n\nThe inverted yield curve went away yesterday at least, as measured by the two and ten-year Treasuries.\n\n2-Year: 1.436\n\n10-Year: 1.471\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nADP Employment Report\n\n195,000 blows away consensus of 140,000\n\nI like that small business hiring picked up but would like to have seen more goods producing (dirty fingernails) jobs.\n\nSmall (1-49 Employees) 66,000\n\nMidsized (50-499 Employees) 77,000\n\nLarge (500 + Employees) 52,000\n\nGoods Producing\n\nNatural Resources & Mining -2,000\n\nConstruction 6,000\n\nManufacturing 8,000\n\nService Providing 184,000\n\nTrade, Transportation & Utilities 39,000\n\nInformation -6,000\n\nFinancial Activities 5,000\n\nProfessional & Business 35,000\n\nEducation & Health 58,000\n\nLeisure & Hospitality 42,000\n\nOther Services 11,000\n\nI like that the market edged higher after the ADP report and gained even more momentum when productivity data came in stronger than expected including unit labor cost of 2.6% against estimates of 2.4%.", "description": "Wednesday was a good session that almost became a great .09/06/2019 8:10:00AM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/226/61b69c4e-f569-403d-8728-5ff0c22ca736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
