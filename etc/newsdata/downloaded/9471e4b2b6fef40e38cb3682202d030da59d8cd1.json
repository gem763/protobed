Schumer on Thursday said the \u201cgreatest insult\u201d from a testy meeting at the White House on Wednesday was the lack of a clear policy from President Trump on how to contain the Islamic State terrorist group, or ISIS.\n\n\u201cThe greatest insult that occurred in that room was simply the lack of policy on how to contain ISIS,\u201d the New York Democrat said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a real danger to the American people and a serious action has occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe asked him repeatedly, what is the policy here, and he didn\u2019t have one,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the greatest insult to the American people, not the names that the president called people, but that he has no plan to deal with what could be a huge problem not just in Syria but here in America, because ISIS can hurt us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted to rebuke Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to remove troops from Northern Syria, and Mr. Schumer said he hoped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would support the Senate version of the resolution.\n\nMr. Schumer also confirmed that the president called former Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe bragged that he was much better at this than Mattis,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Mattis is one of the most respected people here in Washington again by all parties.\u201d\n\nMr. Schumer, along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, ended up leaving the meeting. Mr. Schumer said Mr. Trump called Mrs. Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pelosi on Wednesday said Mr. Trump had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and was \u201cshaken up\u201d by the margins of the House vote rebuking his Syria policy.\n\nThe president said there is something wrong with Mrs. Pelosi \u201cupstairs\u201d or she doesn\u2019t like \u201cour great Country.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!\u201d the president said on Twitter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
