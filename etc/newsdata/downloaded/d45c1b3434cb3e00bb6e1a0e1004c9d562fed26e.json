It has always been like this and remains the same way; nothing has changed.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old has played 692 times in the Barca first team having joined the outfit as a 13-year-old and made his way through the academy, Barcelona C and Barcelona B.\n\nHe has a glittering trophy cabinet which has seen him win 10 La Liga titles, six Copa del Reys and four Champions League - alongside many individual accolades such as five Ballon d'Ors.", "description": "Messi allied fears at Barca that he might not sign on the dotted line again by admitting that he plans to stay at the club \"forever\"", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20553681.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FC-Barcelona-v-Inter-Group-F-UEFA-Champions-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
