But you would be wrong.\n\n\u201cAll the evidence that I have reviewed suggests Elizabeth Warren is not the automatic beneficiary of Sanders dropping out,\u201d says Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThere is more of a crossover between Sanders and Biden than one might imagine.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s good news for former Vice President Biden, who holds a steady but tenuous lead in the crowded field, but who would fall to a distant second if the support for Warren and Sanders were combined. But the race is more complex than that, says Galston, a veteran of six presidential campaigns, and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the Sanders constituency is quite different than Warren\u2019s.\u201d", "authors": ["Eleanor Clift"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571885790/191022-Clift-bernie-tease_fwwqqz", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
