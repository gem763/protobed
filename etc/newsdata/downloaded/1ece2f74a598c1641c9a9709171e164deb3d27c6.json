Maybe. Or maybe they don\u2019t know them all that well (aside from Trump) and after all the terrible 30-second attack ads, voters will be in the same place they started: These guys may (or may not) be bad actors, but what are you offering instead? More bull about how the \u201cprocess\u201d matters? Yes, process and institutions matter, but for folks whose Job 1 is getting through the day or worrying about their kids\u2019 welfare, better government is a byproduct of vision and leadership.\n\nThis, at its core, is what\u2019s so mystifying. An overwhelming number of Americans express displeasure with our political system. On any given day, well over 50% of the country says it\u2019s unhappy with President Trump\u2019s words or deeds, and yet Democrats mainly offer grievance and anger to their urban, hyper-liberal base who think Twitter trolls are representative of America.\n\nThis is not a recipe for success.
