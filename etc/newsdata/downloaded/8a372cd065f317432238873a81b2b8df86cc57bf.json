He was born at a healthy 5lbs 7ozs.\n\nDoctor Pan explained: \u2018Newborns usually cry shortly after being born as their respiratory system is introduced to the new surroundings.\n\n\u2018But when this boy was born, still in his amniotic sac, it was as if he were still in his mum\u2019s womb.\n\nIncredible footage from the procedure shows the boy being removed from his mother\u2019s womb (Picture: AsiaWire/Dr Pan Mian)\n\n\u2018It was not until doctors opened the membrane and cleared the amniotic fluid from his respiratory system that he began to cry \u2013 a full two minutes later than normal babies.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoctor Pan added: \u2018We opted for this procedure because preterm babies are weaker than full-term babies.\n\nMonkeys scream out in pain in secret footage recorded at 'German lab'\n\n\u2018As premature births are among the main reasons for infant mortality, an en caul birth allows the newborn to be delivered inside the same protective membrane.\n\n\u2018This reduces moisture loss on the skin, avoids rapid temperature loss after a preterm birth, and decreases the risk of the infant being harmed during a C-section.\n\n\u2018Even if an en caul delivery were unsuccessful, the baby could then be delivered via a traditional C-section, so it\u2019s just one more option to have.\u2019\n\nAccording to reports, the boy was the first child on record to be born en caul in the city of Fuzhou, after medics studied how to carry out the procedure and put their new skills to good use when the case called for it.\n\nIn the three months that followed, the hospital delivered 10 other children using the same procedure.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
