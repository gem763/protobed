Such a question seems absurd; unfortunately, a US District judge has just answered in the affirmative.\n\nBilal Kareem is a US citizen of Syrian origin, who was living in Brooklyn and working as a stand-up comedian. Frustrated by the news coverage of the conflict in Syria and especially the failure of journalists to interview and try to understand the experience of the people actually involved in the conflict, Kareem moved to Aleppo and established the YouTube channel On the Ground News TV, which provided content to news outlets around the world.\n\nSuddenly, drones started firing missiles at him. In the summer of 2016, he was nearly killed by Hellfire missiles fired by Predator drones five times.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNobody but the US had weaponized drones in the region at the time. Based on publicly available information about how the US uses cellphone data to identify targets, it seemed likely that the US government had concluded, probably based upon its algorithms, that because Bilal Kareem was spending time interviewing rebels, he was a rebel himself. The result of using software to determine who to kill resulted in the US targeting one of its own, who was actually engaging in a deeply important First Amendment activity.\n\nIn 2017, Reprieve and my law firm filed a suit on behalf of Kareem and another Syria-based journalist in Washington DC, arguing that they had a due process right not to be placed on a Kill List and targeted for execution without being able to challenge the basis for that decision.\n\n\u201cHe seeks his birthright,\u201d wrote Judge Rosemary Collyer, a George W Bush appointee, \u201c\u2026a timely assertion of his due process rights under the Constitution to be heard before he might be included on the Kill List and his First Amendment rights to free speech before he might be targeted for lethal action due to his profession.\u201d\n\nThis was a landmark ruling, and to most readers it would seem like common sense. However, the government then sought to dismiss it on the grounds that the government would have to reveal \u201cstate secrets\u201d in telling Kareem whether or not he had been targeted and why.\n\nThis was a case in which the state secrets privilege would be tested against a US citizen\u2019s right not to be killed by his government without some form of due process, and perhaps an opportunity to suggest why killing him was a mistake. The motion was accompanied by affidavits, largely classified, from the Director of National Intelligence and the Acting Secretary of Defense.\n\nWe argued that the government\u2019s claim to be able to inflict death by drone strike made Bilal Kareem akin to a criminal defendant in a capital case, albeit facing execution without trial. In cases where the government relies on state secrets to prosecute a crime, and refuses to disclose them, the government must dismiss the case. Here, the government could simply have stated that whether or not Kareem had ever been on the Kill List, or could promise to take no efforts to try to kill him. But the government was unwilling to do that. It sought to prevent any from any judicial oversight of its decision.\n\nThe court found that the state secrets privilege was absolute; that the government had shown there was a national security concern that protected it from providing any information, even in a classified setting; and so any legal objection to Bilal Kareem\u2019s assassination would be summarily dismissed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The precious objects bringing comfort to Syrian refugees 1/26 Syrian refugee children attending Unicef Makani centres in Za'atari refugee camp share the stories behind the objects they brought from Syria and the powerful memories that they represent Photos Unicef/Christopher Herwig 2/26 Omar, 11, holds his teddy bear Ben 10 \u2018My Ben 10 transforms into an alien from space and he saves the world,\u2019 says the 11-year-old. \u2018I brought it from Syria. My brother gave it to me before he died.\u2019 Omar lost both of his older brothers in the conflict. His brother Abdulrahman was just 7 years old when he died. 'He bought it for me in the market and told me to take care of it. We used to watch the cartoon together. I still watch it now.' He doesn't remember much about his home in Syria but he thinks it was as big as a Unicef Makani centre, where he goes for learning and psychosocial support. 'Most of our stuff we had to leave behind but my mum packed Ben 10 so I could play with it. It's so important to me. This toy is as precious to me as my own brother. I'm going to keep it forever.' Unicef/Herwig 3/26 Omar The best part of Omar\u2019s day is sunset when he comes home from school and Makani, eats food and does his homework sitting with his family. His favourite subject is maths and he studies hard to achieve his dream. \u2018I want to become a pilot. I used to be afraid of planes but now I want to travel. Maybe if I get on a plane I won\u2019t be afraid anymore.\u2019 Omar now has two little sisters in Za\u2019atari Refugee Camp. He lets his youngest sister Islam play with Ben 10. When he gets dirty he puts him in the washing machine. \u2018I\u2019m the only boy now. I think my brother would be proud of me.\u2019 Makani (which translates as \u2018My Space\u2019) centres provide an integrated set of services to children in the camp, including learning support, community-based child protection, early childhood development, adolescent and youth participation, life skills and innovation labs Unicef/Herwig 4/26 Yahya, 13, holds a passport photo of himself \u2018This is a photo of me. It\u2019s my memory. It means a lot to me because it was taken for my school registration form. I was in the first grade for only one week and then we had to come here. I have memories from this time, both good and bad. I remember how my school looked, it was beautiful. I had started making friends and playing football. But the bad memories are of the war, when we were under bombing. I want to forget this memory and the memory of the journey here. It was night time when we left Syria and we could hardly see the road in front of us. We moved through valleys full of thorns that hurt when we stepped on them. People started throwing away their belongings because of how hard the journey was, anything heavy had to go. I had to leave behind my school books, my pens and my colours because my mum told me too. She said it wouldn\u2019t be long before we came back home. But it\u2019s been six years.\u2019 He is now in sixth grade Unicef/Herwig 5/26 Qusai, 13, holds a schoolbag \u2018I was in first grade in Syria and my dad gave me this schoolbag. I was only little then but now I\u2019m in the sixth grade.\u2019 Although the schoolbag is now too small for him, he keeps it safe. \u2018It\u2019s important to me because my father gave it to me as a gift and I remember him by it. Also because it is from my country.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 6/26 Qusai He still has happy memories from life in Syria, including going to school. \u2018I used to feel really happy when break came and I could go to the shop. I remember playing in the schoolyard, my friends chasing me and me chasing them.\u2019 Although he preferred his school in Syria, he still enjoys going to school in the camp. His favourite subject is English and he wants to become an English teacher. He has no plans to give up the old schoolbag. \u2018I will keep this schoolbag forever. I will tell my children my father gave this to me and I kept it safe for all these years to show you.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 7/26 Ayoub, 13, holds a set of spoons \u2018These are my spoons. I was six when I left Syria. I wanted to take them with me from Syria as a memory so I grabbed them as we were leaving the house and I carried them the whole way here. I used to eat my meals with them back at home so I thought that I am going to need them to eat when I come to the camp.\u2019 Ayoub has dropped out of school in the camp but he continues to attend a Makani centre for learning and psychosocial support. \u2018When I grow up, I want to be a taxi driver because I want to leave the camp and go everywhere. I\u2019ve been in a taxi before and I loved it. Inside the camp we don\u2019t have taxis, only bicycles. I\u2019m not in school so I can\u2019t be a doctor or an engineer but I think it\u2019s the easiest thing for me to do when I grow up. In Za'atari, there are 13 Makani centres serving over 7,000 children. Located in every district of the camp, vulnerable children, youth and communities have access to Makani, no matter where they live Unicef/Herwig 8/26 Hamza, 14, holds a handwritten note, from his teacher in Syria \u2018This note was written by my teacher when I was in first grade in Syria. It\u2019s a thank you letter to my family saying that I am a good student.\u2019 The note calls Hamza a star. \u2018I made sure to put it in my bag when we were coming here.\u2019 Hamza is now in the eighth grade and has made a big effort to keep achieving academically, despite the disruption to his education. \u2018It\u2019s important for me to keep it because it reminds me of when I was the best student in my class.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 9/26 Mohammad, 16, holds his hat \u2018This is my hat. My father used to work in Damascus. He bought it there and gave it to me. Life then was magnificent.\u2019 He still remembers the beginning of the conflict in Syria. \u2018Children were being killed and houses were being bombed. My father feared for our lives and for our future. When we had to leave Syria, it was winter. I remember crossing a valley and the ground being difficult to walk on. It was dangerous, cars were sliding on the ice.\u2019 Mohammad brought as much of his clothing as he could carry to Za\u2019atari but the hat remains his most loved item. \u2018I wore it all the way crossing to Jordan and I still wear it every winter. It\u2019s so precious, it reminds me of Syria. And it\u2019s a gift from my Dad which is why it means so much to me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 10/26 Mohammad Mohammad lives with his parents and brothers and sisters in the camp. He is in tenth grade and likes school. He feels like the camp is home because he is surrounded by his family and a bigger Syrian community who keep their memories alive. \u2018My parents tell me about when we were little. They say that Syria was beautiful. I will go back home to my village and continue living there. I will bring my hat and tell my children everything about my story.\u2019 When asked if it\u2019s important for children in Za\u2019atari to try to remember Syria when some of the memories are so traumatic, he replies straight away: \u2018Both. I think it\u2019s very important to keep memories but also to forget the horrors of war.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 11/26 Ahmad, 12, holds a key ring inscribed with his father's name \u2018This key ring belonged to my dad, I inherited it from him a long time ago. He died of a heart attack at the start of the war in Syria. I barely have any memories of my dad but the few I have are very precious. My favourite memory is the time he brought us to the river for a picnic and we played in the water. If I want to remember him, I take out his key ring and look at it.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 12/26 Ahmad Ahmad wants to be an architect when he grows us because his father worked in construction. \u2018I still have a long way to go as I am only in the sixth grade but I will do my best. It would make my Dad proud of me.\u2019 Ahmad lives with his grandmother and brother in the camp. Although they don\u2019t have much, he says that their love is enough for him Unicef/Herwig 13/26 Yara, 10, holds a doll \u2018This toy is from Syria. Her name is Farah.\u2019 Yara\u2019s father gave her Farah for her birthday. \u2018He used to buy me so many things.\u2019 She enjoys taking off Farah\u2019s dress, washing it and dressing her again. \u2018I take care of her because I love her. I feel happy when I\u2019m with her. I take her everywhere. I sleep with her. I tell her the story of Little Red Riding Hood \u2013 it\u2019s about a wolf - to put her to sleep.\u2019 Yara still has memories of her bedroom in Syria. \u2018It was white and I had teddy bears and one was really big. Bigger than me. It got scary in Syria. There were shootings. Dad said get your stuff together, we\u2019re going. I wanted to bring that teddy bear here but my parents said no, it was too big. So I put Farah in my bag. I told her we\u2019re going to Za\u2019atari. I told her don\u2019t made any sound because if you do, we can\u2019t go in. She was scared Unicef/Herwig 14/26 Yara We were both happy when we arrived in Za\u2019atari. I brought a pink dress too just like Farah\u2019s. I am never going to get rid of her. I have so many toys, even one that costs 5 JD, but I love this one.\u2019 Yara goes to school in the camp and wants to be a pharmacist when she grows up so she can give people medicine that will heal them. She wants to return to Syria. \u2018I will dress her up and get her ready and we will go. But this time, I\u2019m bringing all of my toys Unicef/Herwig 15/26 Hala, 11, holding a photo of her and her older brother in Syria \u2018My favourite photo is me and my brother together. It was a Friday. My mum had dressed me nicely for Friday prayer, then we went to the market and a restaurant. After that we went to a photographer\u2019s studio where this photo was taken.\u2019 Hala keeps her photos from Syria hidden in her closet to keep them safe. She takes them out from time to time to look at them. \u2018I only remember the war. I used to be so afraid. Bombs used to fall all around our house. Without photos, I wouldn\u2019t know what it was like to be a kid in Syria. Because Syria is in my heart, it is my country where I was born. When I look at this photo, I remember those days again. There aren\u2019t enough words to describe the life I see in these photos. It\u2019s pure happiness.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 16/26 Hala Hala missed two years of her education because of the conflict, one in Syria and one in Jordan. Now she is in the fourth grade. \u2018I love school a lot. Arabic is my favourite subject and I want to be a surgeon. My mum told me that it was her dream when she was a child to become one but she got married instead. I want her to fulfil her dream through me.\u2019 As well as getting a good education, Hala knows what it will take to achieve her dream. \u2018I have to be courageous and not fear anything.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 17/26 Rudaina, 11, holds house keys \u2018These are my house keys. I brought them with me because when we go back to Syria, I\u2019m going to be the one who opens the door. My parents tell me that Syria is beautiful. I was so little that I don\u2019t remember.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 18/26 Rudaina Rudaina is in fourth grade and her favourite subject is Maths. She wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up. \u2018We once had a home but now we live in a caravan. I feel so sad when I hold the keys because I\u2019m so far away from home. Unicef/Herwig 19/26 Nour, 12, holds a blanket \u2018This is my blanket. When I was little and it was my birthday, my grandmother bought it for me. I remember that we had to flee because there was bombing. It was night time. That\u2019s why we came here. I was covered in it when I was little and I came here. It protected me against the cold and the rain. I was scared but my mum held me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 20/26 Nour Nour wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Her favourite subject is Social Studies because she likes it and her teacher. \u2018I still have feelings when I cover myself in this blanket. I feel sadness thinking about the old beautiful days in Syria. But I also feel protected and safe. I\u2019m going to keep it as long as I can.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 21/26 Iman, 13, holds her doll Her name is Lulu. She\u2019s a gift from my mum so she\u2019s very important. I love her! We brought her here from Syria. When I was little and upset, my parents would give me this toy and I would stop crying. I feel safe as long as Lulu is with me. When the war started and there was shooting, I used to hug her to feel safe. I remember coming here. It was at night and it was dark. On the journey I felt protected having her with me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 22/26 Iman These days, having Lulu near still makes Iman feel better whenever she is afraid or sad. She keeps her hidden but still lets her little sister play with her. \u2018I will keep Lulu forever.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 23/26 Zaina*, 13, holding a framed photo of her father \u2018That\u2019s my father\u2019s photo. When I was in first grade he died in the war. I wanted to bring this with me when I came here. It was hanging on the wall. I saw my mother putting stuff together so I ran to the photo and took it off the wall and put it in her bag. I have many memories of all the toys he gave me that I couldn\u2019t bring with me.\u2019 Zaina has been living in the camp for six years. She is in sixth grade and her favourite subject is English. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up. \u2018I wish to return to Syria and for life to be like it was before. I will put my father\u2019s photo back on the wall where it was hanging before.\u2019 *name changed to protect identity Unicef/Herwig 24/26 Shatha, 15, holds a toy dog \u2018I brought this dog,\u2019 says Shath. \u2018I was little when we left Syria, only 8 or 9 years old. I don\u2019t remember much. When we had to leave, I took him with me, I was thinking he would protect me. I had so many toys to choose from but he was my favourite. I played with him a lot. I remember being on the bus here and sleeping a lot. I held him the whole way to Za\u2019atari. \u2018The camp was full of tents back then and life was hard, really hard. I kept getting lost. I never let go of my dog in those first days so he could protect me. Now life is sweet. We have these centres and schools and we\u2019re getting an education. We have friends and parties Unicef/Herwig 25/26 Shatha Shatha wants to be a lawyer when she grows up to protect herself and others. \u2018I love the Makani, it\u2019s my favourite place in the camp. We learn and we play here. I play lots of football and like the computers. \u2018My toy dog will always be with me. I\u2019ll tell my children my whole life story and his because it\u2019s the same as mine.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 26/26 Sham*, 7, holding a photo of her father \u2018That photo was taken in Syria. It\u2019s important to me because my father died and I loved him so much. He used to tell me stories, stories about Syria. I loved his stories so much. One day he told me we were going to the camp in five days. He said the war is going to get bad so you have to go. He told me you will grow older and I need you to look after your mother. He wouldn\u2019t come with us and he died in Syria.\u2019 Sham says that if she ever lost the photos of her father, she would never stop looking for them. To keep them safe, she hides them in a bag and then hides the bag in their caravan. She goes to school and is in the second grade. \u2018I like to go to school to learn. Science is my favourite subject. I study hard so I can practice on my own without using the books.\u2019 If my dad was here now he would ask me \u201cwhat do you want to be when your grow up\u201d and I would say, I want to be an engineer just like you\u2019. He would be really proud of me. *name changed to protect identity Unicef/Herwig 1/26 Syrian refugee children attending Unicef Makani centres in Za'atari refugee camp share the stories behind the objects they brought from Syria and the powerful memories that they represent Photos Unicef/Christopher Herwig 2/26 Omar, 11, holds his teddy bear Ben 10 \u2018My Ben 10 transforms into an alien from space and he saves the world,\u2019 says the 11-year-old. \u2018I brought it from Syria.

I feel happy when I\u2019m with her. I take her everywhere. I sleep with her. I tell her the story of Little Red Riding Hood \u2013 it\u2019s about a wolf - to put her to sleep.\u2019 Yara still has memories of her bedroom in Syria. \u2018It was white and I had teddy bears and one was really big. Bigger than me. It got scary in Syria. There were shootings. Dad said get your stuff together, we\u2019re going. I wanted to bring that teddy bear here but my parents said no, it was too big. So I put Farah in my bag. I told her we\u2019re going to Za\u2019atari. I told her don\u2019t made any sound because if you do, we can\u2019t go in. She was scared Unicef/Herwig 14/26 Yara We were both happy when we arrived in Za\u2019atari. I brought a pink dress too just like Farah\u2019s. I am never going to get rid of her. I have so many toys, even one that costs 5 JD, but I love this one.\u2019 Yara goes to school in the camp and wants to be a pharmacist when she grows up so she can give people medicine that will heal them. She wants to return to Syria. \u2018I will dress her up and get her ready and we will go. But this time, I\u2019m bringing all of my toys Unicef/Herwig 15/26 Hala, 11, holding a photo of her and her older brother in Syria \u2018My favourite photo is me and my brother together. It was a Friday. My mum had dressed me nicely for Friday prayer, then we went to the market and a restaurant. After that we went to a photographer\u2019s studio where this photo was taken.\u2019 Hala keeps her photos from Syria hidden in her closet to keep them safe. She takes them out from time to time to look at them. \u2018I only remember the war. I used to be so afraid. Bombs used to fall all around our house. Without photos, I wouldn\u2019t know what it was like to be a kid in Syria. Because Syria is in my heart, it is my country where I was born. When I look at this photo, I remember those days again. There aren\u2019t enough words to describe the life I see in these photos. It\u2019s pure happiness.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 16/26 Hala Hala missed two years of her education because of the conflict, one in Syria and one in Jordan. Now she is in the fourth grade. \u2018I love school a lot. Arabic is my favourite subject and I want to be a surgeon. My mum told me that it was her dream when she was a child to become one but she got married instead. I want her to fulfil her dream through me.\u2019 As well as getting a good education, Hala knows what it will take to achieve her dream. \u2018I have to be courageous and not fear anything.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 17/26 Rudaina, 11, holds house keys \u2018These are my house keys. I brought them with me because when we go back to Syria, I\u2019m going to be the one who opens the door. My parents tell me that Syria is beautiful. I was so little that I don\u2019t remember.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 18/26 Rudaina Rudaina is in fourth grade and her favourite subject is Maths. She wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up. \u2018We once had a home but now we live in a caravan. I feel so sad when I hold the keys because I\u2019m so far away from home. Unicef/Herwig 19/26 Nour, 12, holds a blanket \u2018This is my blanket. When I was little and it was my birthday, my grandmother bought it for me. I remember that we had to flee because there was bombing. It was night time. That\u2019s why we came here. I was covered in it when I was little and I came here. It protected me against the cold and the rain. I was scared but my mum held me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 20/26 Nour Nour wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Her favourite subject is Social Studies because she likes it and her teacher. \u2018I still have feelings when I cover myself in this blanket. I feel sadness thinking about the old beautiful days in Syria. But I also feel protected and safe. I\u2019m going to keep it as long as I can.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 21/26 Iman, 13, holds her doll Her name is Lulu. She\u2019s a gift from my mum so she\u2019s very important. I love her! We brought her here from Syria. When I was little and upset, my parents would give me this toy and I would stop crying. I feel safe as long as Lulu is with me. When the war started and there was shooting, I used to hug her to feel safe. I remember coming here. It was at night and it was dark. On the journey I felt protected having her with me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 22/26 Iman These days, having Lulu near still makes Iman feel better whenever she is afraid or sad. She keeps her hidden but still lets her little sister play with her. \u2018I will keep Lulu forever.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 23/26 Zaina*, 13, holding a framed photo of her father \u2018That\u2019s my father\u2019s photo. When I was in first grade he died in the war. I wanted to bring this with me when I came here. It was hanging on the wall. I saw my mother putting stuff together so I ran to the photo and took it off the wall and put it in her bag. I have many memories of all the toys he gave me that I couldn\u2019t bring with me.\u2019 Zaina has been living in the camp for six years. She is in sixth grade and her favourite subject is English. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up. \u2018I wish to return to Syria and for life to be like it was before. I will put my father\u2019s photo back on the wall where it was hanging before.\u2019 *name changed to protect identity Unicef/Herwig 24/26 Shatha, 15, holds a toy dog \u2018I brought this dog,\u2019 says Shath. \u2018I was little when we left Syria, only 8 or 9 years old. I don\u2019t remember much. When we had to leave, I took him with me, I was thinking he would protect me. I had so many toys to choose from but he was my favourite. I played with him a lot. I remember being on the bus here and sleeping a lot. I held him the whole way to Za\u2019atari. \u2018The camp was full of tents back then and life was hard, really hard. I kept getting lost. I never let go of my dog in those first days so he could protect me. Now life is sweet. We have these centres and schools and we\u2019re getting an education. We have friends and parties Unicef/Herwig 25/26 Shatha Shatha wants to be a lawyer when she grows up to protect herself and others. \u2018I love the Makani, it\u2019s my favourite place in the camp. We learn and we play here. I play lots of football and like the computers. \u2018My toy dog will always be with me. I\u2019ll tell my children my whole life story and his because it\u2019s the same as mine.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 26/26 Sham*, 7, holding a photo of her father \u2018That photo was taken in Syria. It\u2019s important to me because my father died and I loved him so much. He used to tell me stories, stories about Syria. I loved his stories so much. One day he told me we were going to the camp in five days. He said the war is going to get bad so you have to go. He told me you will grow older and I need you to look after your mother. He wouldn\u2019t come with us and he died in Syria.\u2019 Sham says that if she ever lost the photos of her father, she would never stop looking for them. To keep them safe, she hides them in a bag and then hides the bag in their caravan. She goes to school and is in the second grade. \u2018I like to go to school to learn. Science is my favourite subject. I study hard so I can practice on my own without using the books.\u2019 If my dad was here now he would ask me \u201cwhat do you want to be when your grow up\u201d and I would say, I want to be an engineer just like you\u2019. He would be really proud of me. *name changed to protect identity Unicef/Herwig\n\nNo doubt there are secrets that a government needs to protect. But as recent events have shown, the government\u2019s penchant for secrecy is reflexive and its claims are categorical.\n\nAs someone who has had Top Secret clearances, I have found it remarkable how easy it is to classify the most banal or embarrassing material. Edward Snowden faces the rest of his life in his prison for publishing secrets, most of which might better be debated in the public domain \u2014 after all, his revelations prompted German Chancellor Angela Merkel to compare the CIA to the Stasi for spying on their friends.\n\nIn the last week, we have seen reports of the classification of inculpatory telephone transcripts under the highest level of security, not to protect national security but to prevent a president\u2019s corruption from seeing the light of day. The judiciary has a critical role to play in scrutinizing claims of secrecy, especially when it is invoked to prevent core First Amendment activity and someone\u2019s life is at stake.\n\nSome of us may be horrified that the US engages in assassination \u2014 execution without trial \u2014 at all. Regardless, surely when someone who claims to be innocent has compelling reason to think he is being targeted, the least we can expect in a democracy is a modicum of due process?", "description": "Does the US Constitution allow President Donald Trump to order the assassination of innocent Americans in total secrecy?
