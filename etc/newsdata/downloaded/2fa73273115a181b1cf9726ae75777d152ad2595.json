By the end of the game, Ovechkin, who cheered from a section behind home plate, wondered on Twitter whether he should make the trip to California for Wednesday\u2019s game. The Capitals host the Stars on Tuesday and play again Thursday at Nashville, so Zimmerman probably shouldn\u2019t get his hopes up.\n\nmaybe I should come to LA ?? )))) go @Nationals !! pic.twitter.com/9FLwHTNt65 \u2014 Alex Ovechkin (@ovi8) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cMe and Ovi, we\u2019ve been here pretty much together the whole time,\u201d Zimmerman told MLB Network after the game. \u201cWe were here as young guys, we used to see each other out all the time. Now we have families and things like that, and I\u2019ve obviously watched his career, and what he\u2019s done has been amazing. He\u2019s just a good friend. We root for each other and for him to come out here tonight was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nRyan Zimmerman\u2019s 3-run HR gives him 13 career #postseason RBI, breaking a tie with @bryceharper3 for most in @Nationals history. pic.twitter.com/v50BeOkJR1 \u2014 MLB Stats (@MLBStats) October 8, 2019\n\nAs the faces of their respective franchises for more than a decade, the 34-year-old Ovechkin and 35-year-old Zimmerman were pals long before the Capitals and Nationals\u2019 intracity bromance blossomed in recent years. At one of his first Nationals games, on Sept. 27, 2006, Ovechkin threw the ceremonial first pitch before watching Zimmerman hit a home run against the Phillies at RFK Stadium. Maybe Ovechkin should do whatever it takes to be at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday, even if it means he\u2019ll be a little tired against the Predators.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast June, Zimmerman and Monday\u2019s other Nationals hero, pitcher Max Scherzer, donned full hockey gear at Capital One Arena to pump up the crowd before Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals. When the Capitals brought the Stanley Cup to Nationals Park three days after they clinched their first title with a Game 5 win in Las Vegas, Ovechkin put his arm around Zimmerman when the teams posed for a group photo in the Nationals\u2019 clubhouse.\n\nFor all of their individual and team accomplishments, and their knack for coming through in big moments, Ovechkin and Zimmerman have both experienced their fair share of playoff disappointment over the past 15 years. Ovechkin, who has averaged nearly a point per game in 128 postseason games, didn\u2019t make it out of the second round of the playoffs until Washington\u2019s Stanley Cup run. Zimmerman is now hitting .306 with three home runs and 13 RBI in 23 career playoff games, but the Nationals are still looking for their first postseason series win.\n\nOvechkin may not be at Dodger Stadium when Zimmerman and the Nationals play for a spot in the NLCS on Wednesday, but there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019ll be rooting for his friend from afar, and ready to celebrate should Washington advance.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "The Capitals\u2019 captain threw the ceremonial first pitch and the Nationals\u2019 first baseman delivered the biggest hit of Game 4.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
