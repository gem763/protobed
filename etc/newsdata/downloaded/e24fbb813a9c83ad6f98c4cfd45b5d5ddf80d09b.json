A migrant randomly approached a woman and her two-year-old son and punch the child in the head outside of a Franprix grocery shop, Le Parisien reports.\n\nAs the woman, named Sandy, demanded an explanation from the migrant, she, too, was also punched in the face, bruising her cheekbone.\n\nSandy claimed that the man who attacked her son had come from a nearby migrant camp and said that while the toddler received a lump on his forehead and required a hospital visit, his injuries were not serious.\n\nParis District Residents Feel \u2018Abandoned\u2019 as Crime Surges https://t.co/Ce9HaLHGlF \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 25, 2019\n\nThe migrant attacker, however, was nearly lynched by locals who attacked him and left him bleeding, according to the young mother. A dozen locals later took to the streets near the migrant camp to protest the attack.\n\n\u201cWe called the police. After an hour, they told us that they could not move because they no longer had a patrol car available,\u201d one demonstrator said. The lack of police presence was likely explained by a football match between France and Turkey that took place on the same evening.\n\nYouma, a local female resident, said that women were particularly vulnerable in the area and described an incident in which her 15-year-old daughter had been sexually harassed by an exhibitionist migrant and another had spat in her face.\n\nFor around two years in the area, the non-profit group Solidarit\u00e9 Migrants Wilson gave out meals to homeless migrants but stopped in 2018 due to safety concerns.\n\nPro-Migrant Group Withdraws Aid from \u2018Dangerous\u2019 Paris Migrant Camp, Claims Operation Too Risky https://t.co/sOyFpkoUcv \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 31, 2018\n\nPhilippe Caro, a member of the group told, Le Parisien: \u201cThere are a lot of great people and of course some hooligans in the package.
