According to Oprah and the Weight Watchers\u2019 website on Wednesday, the tour will be known as, \u201cOprah\u2019s 2020 Vision: Your Life in Focus.\u201d\n\nChris Winfield, the co-founder of the media consultancy Superconnector Media, sees the tour as a logical move.\n\n\u201cOprah is the queen of all media, and she has long focused on wellness topics such as mental and physical wellbeing, so her move into the wellness sphere is not a real surprise, especially given her partnership with Weight Watchers,\u201d Winfield explained.\n\nThis is not her first foray into live events, in 2014, she fronted \u201cThe Life You Want\u201d tour which was seen as a success, according to a report from The New York Times. Ticket prices ranged from $199 to $999.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis venture is a nine-city tour, which starts Jan. 4th in Ft. Lauderdale and concludes March 7th in Denver.\n\nMarketing experts say that this move comes at a time when brands are strategically refreshing themselves with \u201cactivations\u201d that aren\u2019t in-your-face marketing ploys. According to the firm Econsultancy, an activation is: \u201cThe process of making your brand known to people, increasing awareness and engagement through some kind of brand experience.\u201d\n\nFOX Business checked in with media experts regarding Oprah\u2019s upcoming tour with Weight Watchers.\n\nWhy are celebrities moving into the live activation space?\n\nAccording to Christina Daves, owner of PR for Anyone, celebrities are switching gears business-wise when it comes to live events \u201cbecause they can draw the crowds. People want to get to \u2018know them in person. It's so difficult to get butts in seats but celebrities have the advantage of their star power.\u201d\n\nAs we've seen with Gwyneth Paltrow and Goop, there's a lot of eyes and ears on the wellness arena, which, next to self-care is the buzzword of the day. This wellness tour will expand [Oprah\u2019s] reach into areas and audiences where she hasn't delved before in depth. It will also get her in front of a live audience again, which is where she connects best with most of the world. Chris Winfield of Superconnector Media said in terms of celebrities hosting live events.\n\nIs there something specific modern consumers are looking for in their live events?\n\n\u201cI believe it's being able to connect with the expert because it's in-person and face-to-face,\u201d Daves said.\n\nJen Gottlieb, the other co-foudner Superconnector Media, said, \u201cThe modern consumer is savvy, smart and is hungry not only for more connection at their live events, but to take actionable takeaways and really feel connected when they get back home.\u201d\n\nGottlieb added, \u201cThey read all the new news and know all the wellness keywords. What they really want is to connect with Oprah, and interact with her magic.\u201d\n\nWhat does this wellness tour do to Oprah\u2019s brand and image?\n\nIt just improves it. Oprah's reputation is solid and everything she touches turns to gold, even with the dip in OWN.\u201d Daves pointed out.\n\nDaves went on to add that Oprah still has her brand and it remains a powerful force with \u201cpeople who are willing to do what Oprah tells them\u2014read this book, try this product, use this diet or meal plan.\u201d\n\nConversely, Gottlieb said, \u201cCelebrities, who used to be untouchable, are now realizing how important it is to really connect with their audience. Fans are demanding this access to their stars like never before. You see it when they respond on Twitter and Instagram to their fans, and how statements are now posted on these forums rather than through their publicist and a chosen outlet.\u201d\n\nThe live activation space is yet another stage for them to perform on, yet also really connect with people. Much like a concert, there is a magic that comes from being in the same room as your favorite star that can't be replaced by television or a computer. Jen Gottlieb of Superconnector Media said regarding modern-day branding.\n\nIt can be hard to sell out event space. What should Oprah do in her tour to ensure her success?\n\nDaves added that implementing pre-event live video to speak directly to audiences is one way Oprah\u2019s team can build excitement around the tour. \u201cWhen you are speaking to your camera, it's as if you are looking eye to eye with the person on the other end,\u201d Daves said.\n\nShe added, \u201cEven though there could be thousands, [Oprah's] relating to each viewer individually.\u201d\n\nWinfield agreed that Oprah is \u201cguaranteed to sell out.\u201d\n\nHe also said that Oprah and her team just have to utilize their connections to be successful, whether it be on social media, her SuperSoul Conversations podcast, website, newsletter or O, The Oprah Magazine.\n\nWinfield added, \u201cSince she does have one of the biggest networks in the world, I\u2019m sure news will travel fast if she utilizes all of her connections. Look at us\u2014we are talking about it before we even know how to get in or buy tickets. It\u2019s working for her brilliantly.\u201d\n\nMembers of Weight Watchers will get access to presale tickets from Sept. 9 to 12. The general public will be able to get tickets starting on Sept. 13.\n\nProceeds from the tour with go to Weight Watchers Good, a philanthropic initiative that brings healthy food to underserved communities.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Oprah Winfrey and Weight Watchers are tag teaming the wellness industry with a nationwide tour.
