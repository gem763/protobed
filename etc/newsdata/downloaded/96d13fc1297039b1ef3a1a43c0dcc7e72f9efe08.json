No, this isn\u2019t about the inversion of the yield curve.\n\nI\u2019m referring to the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.00%, which this week fell below the S&P 500\u2019s dividend yield SPX, +0.06%, reversing a relationship that \u2014 with only a couple of minor exceptions in recent years \u2014 has held since 1958.\n\nBonds in the late 1950s entered a devastating bear market that lasted more than two decades, as bond yields rose by several orders of magnitude \u2014 as you can see from the accompanying chart. (Note carefully that the chart also includes the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% , since the federal government didn\u2019t begin offering the 30-year bond until the late 1970s; since then the two yields have been closely linked.)\n\nMany commentators are predicting that this week\u2019s development will presage a similarly devastating bear market for bonds. I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nFor insight, I turn to a study into what causes the Treasury yield to be higher or lower than the dividend yield. The study was conducted by Cliff Asness, founding principal at AQR Capital Management. He found that perhaps the biggest factor is the \u201clong-run difference in volatility between stocks and bonds.\u201d\n\nHe reached this conclusion upon analyzing stock and bond volatility since 1871. He found that, whenever bond market volatility over the trailing couple of decades was higher than stock market volatility, Treasurys tended to yield more than stocks. Just the reverse was the case when trailing stock market volatility was higher than for bonds.\n\nNote that Asness is focusing on stocks\u2019 and bonds\u2019 relative yields, not the absolute levels of those yields. He is not denying that expected inflation or the economy play a big role in determining their individual yield levels. But since both stock and bond yields in large part respond similarly to those factors, they can\u2019t explain long-term fluctuations in their relative yields.\n\nTo illustrate how relative volatility can explain those fluctuations, consider that, beginning in the 1950s, bond market volatility over the trailing 20 years began to rise relative to trailing stock market volatility \u2014 and continued rising for 30 years. Sure enough, over most of that period the Treasury yield was higher than the dividend yield.\n\nThe situation reversed in the 1980s. That\u2019s when bond market volatility over the trailing 20 years began to fall, relative to trailing stock market volatility. And since then the Treasury yield has been falling, relative to the dividend yield. With this week\u2019s development, the Treasury yield finally fell below.\n\nAsness\u2019 findings focus our attention on what would cause the Treasury yield to remain below the dividend yield for many years, which it will if the Treasury market\u2019s trailing volatility continues to stay low, relative to the stock market\u2019s. This seems likely, for at least a while longer, because trailing 20-year volatilities evolve slowly.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that most bond investors nowadays have no memories of the devastating bond bear-market that lasted from the late 1950s to the early 1980s. It will take a lot to overcome the serene view investors now have of the extraordinary bond bull-market of recent years.\n\nIn the equity arena, in contrast, investors\u2019 memories of the 2008 Great Recession remain fresh, and memories of the 2000 internet bubble also are more a part of investor consciousness than the devastating bond bear-market of prior decades. This also suggests that the stock market\u2019s dividend yield may remain high relative to the Treasury yield.\n\nNone of this means that the stock or bond market won\u2019t undergo a bear market. Each .market could experience a big uptick in its volatility without altering the two markets\u2019 relative volatilities.\n\nNevertheless, given the stock market\u2019s current extreme overvaluation, it certainly seems plausible that its volatility \u2014 relative to the bond market\u2019s \u2014 will remain high in coming years, even if the bond market also declines. If that\u2019s the case, the stock market\u2019s dividend yield should continue to be higher than the 30-year Treasury.\n\nThe bottom line: As usual, things are more complicated than they may seem on first blush. While some commentators are being quick to declare that a bear market for bonds is imminent because the dividend yield is now higher than the long bond yield, the more appropriate focus is on the two asset classes\u2019 relative volatilities.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
