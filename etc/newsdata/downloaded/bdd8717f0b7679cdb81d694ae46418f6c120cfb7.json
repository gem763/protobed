In spite of polarized electorates, volatile markets and no immediate let-up in the Sino-American trade dispute, the survey showed 53% worldwide are optimistic about the global economy. Meanwhile, some 61% were bullish on their own region\u2019s economy \u2014 with Asia having the brightest outlook.\n\nMeanwhile, UBS\u2019s data found that more investors were more unnerved by political instability in their home countries than a trade war. With the U.K.\u2019s fractious effort to divorce itself from the European Union, an impeachment inquiry swirling around President Donald Trump, and other flashpoints mounting, 47% of respondents said politics was a concern \u2014 with that percentage even higher in the U.S. (60%).\n\n\u201cGeopolitical concerns such as the global trade war are keeping investor optimism in check,\u201d said Paula Polito, UBS\u2019s client strategy officer. \u201cThere is a dichotomy in sentiment \u2014 investors are holding large cash balances in a wait-and-see mode, even though nearly 50% anticipate higher stock market returns in the next six months.\u201d\n\nThe shift to cash\n\nStill, UBS revealed some pockets of concern for investors, both regionally and globally. As the trade war amplifies global recession fears, a whopping 73% of respondents say they\u2019ve been whipsawed by the volatile market \u2014 and more are shifting money to cash in a bid for liquidity.\n\nAlthough a separate report in September showed retail investors recently moving more money into stocks, the shift to cash has become \u201cthe most popular reaction to trade developments among [wealthy] respondents,\u201d UBS noted. In fact, nearly half of those investors believe the U.S.-China dispute will have negative implications on U.S. growth \u2014 and 52% believe it will eventually hit China\u2019s domestic economy. Just this week, the world\u2019s second-largest economy reported its slowest rate of growth since 1992 at 6%.\n\nRecent data from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch shows that hedge fund managers are fearing negative growth at levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 and some of that fear was evident in UBS\u2019s own survey. Among entrepreneurs and investors, 44% think a recession is \u201chighly likely\u201d within the next 6 months.\n\nAnd those concerns are translating into muted hiring plans. UBS found that 34% are planning to create new jobs, a percentage that fell 5 points from the last survey.\n\nJavier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
