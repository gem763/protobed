One of the people said a deal is expected in the next two to three weeks.\n\nAnalysts had previously estimated that the company would run out of money by the middle of next year. WeWork parent We Co. had been counting on an initial public offering -- and a $6 billion loan contingent on a successful IPO -- to meet its cash needs, but that plan unraveled amid questions about its future profitability.
