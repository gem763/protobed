And I apologize for having said it,\" he told reporters in Iowa. \"And I apologize for it then and I apologize for it now. The fact of the matter is it shouldn't be used at all, but the encouragement of white supremacists, which [Donald Trump has] done his entire presidency, that's what I was responding to. Because that's what it was. It was like a dog whistle...he's done it throughout \u2014 from Charlottesville on. When has he ever taken \u2014 when has he ever said a negative thing about a white supremacist? Have you heard anything? I haven't.\"\n\nThe apologies come after Biden excoriated President Trump for comparing impeachment to a lynching.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is not 'lynching,' it is part of our Constitution,\u201d he said in response to the president's tweet. \u201cOur country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable.\u201d\n\nImpeachment is not \"lynching,\" it is part of our Constitution.
