At last, we\u2019ve been liberated from legislation that polices our bodies, fertility and healthcare. We\u2019re free from the threat of prosecution. We\u2019re free from a climate of stigma and fear.\n\nThe impact this will have on people\u2019s everyday lives is enormous.\n\nFrom today onwards, no-one will suffer a crisis pregnancy alone. From today onwards, anyone in Northern Ireland can go to their doctor and seek advice about abortion access without fear of being reported to the police. And from today onwards, doctors and midwives can provide this medical advice and care to their patients, without facing prosecution for doing so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the end to the criminalisation of our reproductive healthcare. Police can no longer investigate or prosecute people for accessing abortions, in line with the new law, and current criminal prosecutions will be dropped.\n\nThis means the mother who helped her 15-year-old daughter access abortion pills online will no longer face trial. Today, she is free. Her future is with her family rather than behind bars.\n\nWomen and girls soon will be able to access abortion services closer to home, no longer forced to travel miles to receive the healthcare elsewhere in the UK. In cases of fatal pregnancies or where there is a serious foetal anomaly, doctors may be able to provide abortion services immediately. In other cases, services will be set up next year.\n\nAnd if anyone needs access to the healthcare service in the meantime, they will have all costs paid for them (including travel and accommodation) by the UK government.\n\nThis means that anyone who finds themselves in crisis pregnancies \u2013 including in cases of rape, incest or where there\u2019s a risk to health \u2013 will no longer suffer in silence. Before today, women and girls have been so scared of potential police investigation and prosecution that they\u2019ve hidden difficult experiences from close friends or family.\n\nFrom now onwards, we\u2019re no longer treated as criminals for making the right medical choices about our own bodies\n\nThe criminalisation of abortion has created an atmosphere of secrecy, shame and isolation. Today, the oppressive cloud that has hung over us for so long has been lifted. Our futures are brighter, more supportive, more caring, open and free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the many of us who have spent years campaigning for this moment, there were times when it felt so far away \u2013 impossible, even.\n\nBut we never gave up. So many people have put their hearts and souls into achieving this change. Individuals have bravely told their stories countless times to journalists, politicians and judges in order to explain just how damaging the abortion law has really been.\n\nThese women include Sarah Ewart, who had to travel to the UK for an abortion after receiving a fatal foetal diagnosis. She\u2019s been working closely with Amnesty to take her case to the High Court, where we achieved a ruling stating that the abortion law was incompatible with the UK\u2019s human rights commitments.\n\nThen there\u2019s Denise, who was forced to continue with a pregnancy despite doctors telling her the foetus wouldn\u2019t survive, and has also tirelessly fought for this change. Not having access to an abortion meant she had to suffer the trauma of delivering a dead foetus. Denise\u2019s experience was completely harrowing. No-one should have to go through what she has. That\u2019s why Denise has been bravely campaigning for the law change to make sure that no-one will have to.\n\nToday, she will have peace of mind that from now on, no one will be harmed by the law that caused her so much pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo all of the people who have shared their stories, to all of the students who have marched, to all of the campaigners who have never given up, to all of the politicians who have stood up for us in Westminster, to all of the women who have gone through the devastating experience of having to travel in secret on a plane to another part of the UK to have an abortion: this day is for you.\n\nFrom now onwards, we\u2019re no longer treated as criminals for making the right medical choices about our own bodies. We\u2019re free.\n\nMORE: Stormont, be on the right side of history.
