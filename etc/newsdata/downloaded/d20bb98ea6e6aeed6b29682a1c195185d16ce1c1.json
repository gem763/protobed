(NYSE: DAL) shares took a hit Thursday following the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings report. Despite beating consensus earnings numbers in the third quarter, Delta\u2019s fourth-quarter guidance disappointed the market due to up to a 5% anticipated rise in costs.\n\nDelta gained market share from competitors in the third quarter, but non-fuel costs were up 2.4%, partly due to rising wages. Delta increased wages by another 4% on Oct. 1.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC Thursday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said he expects Delta to retain its third-quarter share gains.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hiring pilots, we\u2019re hiring flight attendants, we\u2019re hiring ground staff,\u201d Basian said. \u201cWe\u2019re the process of hiring 6,000 people this year and at least a like amount next year.\u201d\n\nSeveral analysts have weighed in on Delta since the disappointing report. Here\u2019s a sampling of what they had to say.\n\nIndustry Headwinds\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said Delta is facing additional challenges in coming quarters.\n\n\u201cDespite in-line 3Q results, headwinds to TRASM and CASM are beginning to accelerate per 4Q guidance and preliminary 2020 commentary,\u201d Lalwani wrote in a note.\n\nBuckingham Research analyst Daniel McKenzie said Delta is making all the right moves, but upside is limited given aggressive consensus estimates for airliners.\n\nView more earnings on DAL\n\n\u201cDAL's preliminary 2020 revenue outlook is more encouraging than we would have anticipated, but it requires others to be disciplined which at this point seems unlikely,\u201d McKenzie wrote.\n\nBuying Opportunity?\n\nTigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth said Delta remains well-positioned to benefit from long-term growth in travel demand, and the stock\u2019s 3% dividend is attractive.\n\n\u201cI believe the recent pullback from its all-time high of $63.43 hit in mid-July is a buying opportunity, and significant upside exists from current levels,\u201d Feinseth wrote.\n\nBank of America analyst Andrew Didora said Delta\u2019s cost outlook was disappointing, but its RASM guidance was in-line with expectations.\n\n\u201cDAL\u2019s +0-2% 4Q19 unit revenue (RASM) outlook was right in line with our and investor expectations, however, the 4Q19 unit cost outlook (CASM-ex) of +4-5% is higher than we had expected after last week\u2019s investor update,\u201d Didora wrote.\n\nRatings And Price Targets\n\nMorgan Stanley has an Equal-Weight rating and $57 target.\n\nBuckingham has a Neutral rating and $56 target.\n\nBank of America has a Neutral rating and $58 target.\n\nDelta's stock traded around $53.28 per share at time of publication.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nDelta, Cameco And More 'Fast Money Halftime Report' Picks For October 10\n\nPreMarket Prep Recap: Making Sense Of A Senseless Market, Finding Support In Delta, PG&E Plunge\n\nLatest Ratings for DAL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Oct 2019 Downgrades Buy Hold Oct 2019 Maintains Neutral Oct 2019 Maintains Outperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for DAL\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
