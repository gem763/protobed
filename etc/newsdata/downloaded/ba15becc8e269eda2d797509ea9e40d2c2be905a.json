The handset comes equipped with a pop-up selfie camera and, surprisingly, given the ongoing US sanctions against Huawei, a full suite of Google apps. Honor declined to share pricing or availability information with us prior to the phone\u2019s announcement today, but it said that it expects the 9X to retail for the equivalent of under \u00a3300 (around \u20ac348 / $386)\n\nI\u2019ve had a chance to use the Honor 9X over the past week, and it\u2019s generally been a pleasant experience, thanks to the phone\u2019s big 6.59-inch notchless display and solid battery life. The phone doesn\u2019t have the greatest cameras around, and Huawei\u2019s EMUI software occasionally feels like it\u2019s getting in the way. But these could be worthwhile compromises at this entry-level price point.\n\nAgree to Continue: Honor 9X Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. While you\u2019re setting up the Honor 9X, you need to agree to the following: Huawei\u2019s End User License Agreement You\u2019ll also have to agree to Google\u2019s terms and conditions if you want to use any of its services on your device, which is almost certainly something you\u2019re going to want to do. That leaves us with one mandatory agreement and one optional agreement for the Honor 9X.\n\nSince the pop-up selfie camera is likely to be a big factor for most people who pick up this device, I think it makes sense to start there. The mechanism is going to invite obvious comparisons to the OnePlus 7T Pro, which was announced earlier this month. But considering the Honor 9X is less than half the price of the OnePlus flagship, it\u2019s hard to complain about Honor\u2019s implementation. Yes, the mechanism raises and lowers a little slower than the 7T Pro\u2019s, but you\u2019re still getting a 16-megapixel selfie camera. The phone is also capable of automatically retracting the sensor when it thinks it\u2019s in danger of getting broken.\n\nContinuing on with the phone\u2019s cameras, around the back, you\u2019ll find three sensors: a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main camera, an 8-megapixel f/2.4 120-degree ultra-wide angle camera, and a 2-megapixel f/2.4 depth assist camera. They\u2019re all contained within a small bump next to the phone\u2019s rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.\n\nYou can find a collection of the shots I took with this phone below, but it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to blow you away. The level of detail isn\u2019t great, especially when you zoom out to use the ultra-wide angle lens, and the phone\u2019s software also tends to lag slightly as you switch between cameras. That said, I found the shutter button to be nice and responsive, so you shouldn\u2019t find that the 9X gets in the way of you snapping a quick shot.\n\nGrid View Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nTaken with the phone\u2019s ultra-wide angle camera.\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nTaken with the phone\u2019s wide-angle camera.\n\nTaken with the phone\u2019s selfie camera.

(I\u2019ve been using the 6GB / 128GB model.) From a hardware perspective, I\u2019ve got little to complain about considering the entry-level price. App switching is fast and painless, and the battery easily lasted me through the day with charge left to spare. It charges using USB-C and also includes a headphone jack.\n\nThe Honor 9X\u2019s IPS LCD display is generally fine with day-to-day use, but Honor has included a feature it calls \u201cEnhanced Dynamic Range,\u201d which adds post-processing to video content to make it look more saturated and contrasty. But to my eyes, it went a little bit too far: skin tones looked overexposed, and all that extra punch just ended up looking artificial. You also can\u2019t turn the feature off, which is a bit of a bummer.\n\nIn terms of software, Huawei\u2019s EMUI (in this case, a skinned version of Android 9) can still be a frustrating experience. You can mitigate this to a certain extent by tweaking your settings (I\u2019ll be having my app drawer back, thank you very much), but you\u2019ll have to put up with other UI elements, like Huawei\u2019s share menu, not to mention its numerous preinstalled apps.\n\nSpeaking of apps, I was a little surprised to find that the Honor 9X will ship with the Google Play Store, and it comes with a full suite of Google\u2019s apps. When I asked about this, Honor told me that the device has been in the works for quite some time, so it was certified by Google before its license to use Android software was revoked. Honor didn\u2019t give any specific details on future software updates, but it said that it plans to support the Honor 9X going forward.\n\nFrom the limited about of time I\u2019ve spent with the Honor 9X, it feels like another solid, affordable phone from the sub-brand. It makes some obvious compromises, but it never drops the ball in any crucial areas. We\u2019ll be sure to update this piece when Honor announces full pricing and release information for the phone.\n\nPhotography by Jon Porter / The Verge", "description": "After launching in the Chinese market back in July, Huawei\u2019s sub-brand Honor has announced that the Honor 9X is coming to Europe.
