Especially one that is able to survive a murderous time loop.\n\nSidney Prescott \u2013 Scream (1996-present)\n\nIcon (Picture: Dimension Films)\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Scream completely reinvented the horror in the mid-\u201990s with its bold tongue-in-cheek humour and unapologetic way it mocked the tired tropes in its own genre.\n\nBut even better, it offered up our darling Sidney Prescott. The long-suffering student whose mother had just died, only to now be tormented by a serial killer bumping off her pals, before it was revealed her boyfriend and his best mate were wearing the Ghostface masks the whole time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not easy to recover from but our girl not only fended off the killer in the original Scream but came out on top in three subsequent sequels.\n\nShe must be exhausted.\n\nWe\u2019re still anxiously awaiting a possible Scream 5 to arrive someday but until then, we hope Sidney is living the happy life she deserves. Killer free, of course.\n\nSarah \u2013 The Descent (2005)\n\nSarah really went through it in The Descent (Picture: Pathe Distribution)\n\nAnother heroine with a tragic backstory.\n\nSarah agreed to go on a caving expedition with her best friends after the death of her husband and daughter, only to find herself trapped, plunged into complete darkness and being hunted by blood-thirsty creatures who pop up when you least expect it.\n\nAs if trying to stay alive in those circumstances weren\u2019t bad enough, Sarah also discovered in the midst of the madness that her best friend Juno had an affair with her beloved husband Paul before his death.\n\nYeah, try dealing with that miles underground.\n\nIt would have been wrong for The Descent to end any other way than Sarah emerging as the hero she truly was.\n\nFYI, we\u2019re going to completely ignore the Descent 2 in which Sarah was eventually killed thus ruining her honour.\n\nLaurie Strode \u2013 Halloween (1978)\n\nLaurie is our hero (Picture: Universal)\n\nLaurie, played by legendary scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, cottoned onto the fact that the suspicious figure of Michael Myers was lurking around Haddonfield pretty early on, which probably gave her a head start in being cautious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, being aware worked in Laurie\u2019s favour because when her friends started getting picked off one by one, she was prepared to fight.\n\nEven if she had to find impromptu weapons like a clothing hanger in the closet. This type of quick thinking is what got her to the end as the only one in her friendship group to survive The Shape\u2019s murderous spree.\n\nSome argue that Laurie was actually saved by detective Loomis shooting Michael but, let\u2019s face it, she got that far on her own so she absolutely qualifies as a final girl and an iconic one at that.\n\nSally \u2013 Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)\n\nSally was an early final girl (Picture: Bryanston Distributing Company)\n\nWidely regarded as the first prominent final girl, Sally managed to survive up against the gruesome Leatherface, his equally insane family and his chainsaw in the middle of nowhere.\n\nSally\u2019s glorious triumph in the end \u2013 being able to escape being tortured by Leatherface and co. by flagging down a passing car \u2013 is even more momentous given it was released at a time where strong and empowered women were few and far between.\n\nEven better is that she wasn\u2019t sexualised and managed to keep her clothes on for the duration of the film. A refreshing trend you\u2019ll notice with final girls.\n\nLila Crane \u2013 Psycho (1960)\n\nLila escaped Norman Bates (Picture: Paramount Pictures)\n\nNorman Bates was able to kill multiple times under the guise of \u2018mother\u2019 so it\u2019s remarkable that Lila was able to survive the murderous peeping tom.\n\nLila was investigating the mysterious disappearance of her sister Marion Crane (played by the legendary Janet Leigh who is also Jamie Lee Curtis\u2019 real life mother), when she risked herself becoming another one of Norman\u2019s victims too.\n\nIn the end, Lila survived with the help of Marion\u2019s boyfriend Sam but it was her own wit that helped her evade being slashed by \u2018mother\u2019.\n\nNancy Thompson \u2013 A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984)\n\nNancy had smart thinking (Picture: New Line Cinema)\n\nAh, one of horror\u2019s foremost golden girls. It was Nancy and her street smarts that figured out Freddy Krueger could no longer haunt them if he couldn\u2019t sense fear, thus saving herself and all the other poor kids from his reign of terror.\n\nNancy was able to keep her head in the game, turning away her boyfriend\u2019s advances to get to the bottom of the man haunting their nightmares and it worked in her favour.\n\nBasically, Nancy clocked back in the \u201880s that sex in a horror movie was a sure-fire way to die.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
