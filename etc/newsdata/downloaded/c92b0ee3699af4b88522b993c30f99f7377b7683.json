It had my UK Biometric Residence Permit and all my bank cards.\n\n'I didn't have much identifying info in there so a good Samaritan got in touch with me via my bank account.\n\nMr Byford used four 1p payments into Mr Cameron's bank account to pass on a message that he had found his wallet in the road along with a phone number to get in contact\n\n'I thought Simon was a bloody legend. When I got to his house I said 'you're a legend', shook his hand, was reunited with my wallet and then I gave him a bottle of wine.\n\n'He's the nicest bloke ever - it's not surprising he went above and beyond to get it back to me.'\n\nMr Byford said he was cycling home when he saw Mr Cameron's wallet in the middle of the road and thought he better rescue it when he realised it had already been run over a few times.\n\nThe 30-year-old had a look inside for some ID and then tried to find Mr Cameron on Facebook - but found it was quite a common name.\n\nThe software developer then thought he could leave the wallet at a nearby pub but ended up just taking it home to have a think about how he could solve the puzzle with Tim's bank details and 'pretty much nothing else'.\n\nWhen it occurred to Mr Byford, from Islington, that he could leave short messages to Tim via bank transfers he thought it was a 'long shot' - but to his surprise about an hour later Tim rang.\n\nMr Byford said: 'It's massively overwhelming. I've just been watching the number of likes go up on Twitter and it's just been crazy.\n\n'When he got in touch I just felt surprise and delight. I was expecting him to [get in touch] eventually but it all happened quite quickly.\n\n'He popped over and brought me a bottle of wine which was very nice of him.\n\n'I think it's what anyone would do. It had all of his stuff in it like his residence permit and loads of stuff that would have been expensive to replace. If I lost my wallet in the road I would want someone to do the same.\n\n'It was also just a bit of a puzzle - like how do I contact this dude who I have such little information about? It was an interesting thing to ponder.'", "description": "Tim Cameron, pictured, was happily reunited with his wallet after dropping it on his way home from work in North London yesterday evening.
