Elizabeth Warren\u2019s call for \u201crespect\u201d in a #IndigenousPeoplesDay tweet elicited immediate backlash Monday and conjured up reminders of her \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d claim and \u201c1/1024th Indian\u201d DNA test.\n\n\u201cThe story of America\u2019s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat tweeted. \u201cWe owe them our respect \u2014 and we must honor our government\u2019s commitments and promises to them. #IndigenousPeoplesDay.\u201d\n\nNearly 2,000 comments highlighted the presidential hopeful\u2019s decision to register as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d for the State Bar of Texas in 1986 and make similar claims for Harvard Law School.\n\nA sampling of the comments include:\n\n\u201cThe best way to honor them is not to pretend that you\u2019re one of them and prevent one from going to college because you claimed you were one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought you should weigh in on this, of all the things.\u201d\n\n\u201cYikes. You went there. And with a straight face.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Mistreatment\u2019 \u2014 like impersonating one to get minority benefits? Asking for a former \u2018woman of color\u2019 professor at Harvard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is 1/1024th sincere.\u201d\n\n\u201cCringeworthy lack of self-awareness right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we should honor them with recipe books called \u2018Pow-Wow Chow.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cA powerful message from the first Native American member of Harvard faculty.\u201d\n\nMrs. Warren maintains that her claims of being Native American were made in good faith.\n\nThe story of America\u2019s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient. We owe them our respect\u2014and we must honor our government\u2019s commitments and promises to them. #IndigenousPeoplesDay \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 14, 2019\n\n\u201cBased on what I learned growing up and the fact that I love my family, decades ago I sometimes identified as Native American,\u201d she on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d in March. \u201cIt never had anything to do with any job that I ever got.\u201d\n\nHost David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, cornered her on this issue, asking, \u201cThe question I have never understood is why. Why did you in 1986 fill out on your law license or something? Why did you check those boxes, because obviously, that\u2019s a very small part of your lineage? 1/32nd or something, so why did you do it? \u2026 The universities kind of fudged and used you for their own purposes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d Mrs. Warren replied. \u201cI\u2019m not a person of color. I am not a citizen of a tribe, but what I try to do is be a good friend of Native Americans.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
