Kurdish leaders, who said back in April that Baghdadi was in Idlib, told The Washington Post they had provided intelligence for the operation. Iraq\u2019s national intelligence service also boasted of giving Baghdadi\u2019s location to the Americans after \u201cconstant monitoring and the formation of a specialised task force over an entire year.\u201d\n\nBut the Turkish National Intelligence Office (MIT)\u2014the country\u2019s closest equivalent to the CIA\u2014isn\u2019t among those taking credit for tracking down Baghdadi, who was killed Saturday in a U.S. Special Forces raid in northern Syria. This, despite the fact that Baghdadi was living just three and a half miles from the Turkish border, in an area controlled by the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army. Baghdadi\u2019s death thus exposes an enduring and under-appreciated reality of geopolitics in the Middle East: The Islamic State has always had a peculiar\u2014which is to say, not exclusively hostile\u2014relationship with Turkey.\n\nThe MIT was not always so reticent: In the aftermath of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Istanbul embassy last year, MIT chief Hakan Fidan shared audio intelligence of the killing with Turkish press and foreign intelligence services. But after Baghdadi\u2019s death, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan instead drew the same moral equivalence he\u2019s been offering for years, equating ISIS with the Kurdish forces who had partnered with the U.S. against ISIS until Trump\u2019s sudden pullout. On Turkey\u2019s role in the Baghdadi operation, Erdogan\u2019s spokesman would only say that \u201cthe night when the operation was conducted ... there was intense diplomacy between our military authorities\u201d and the incoming American forces. Turkey\u2019s Defense Ministry gave the U.S. operation faint praise, calling it \u201cwithin the spirit of alliance and strategic partnership\u201d in the fight against terror.\n\n\n\nThe spirit of that alliance is mutual suspicion: The U.S. military, fearful that info on its move against Baghdadi would leak, only told Turkish officials that an operation was planned in Turkish-held territory, but did not identify the target, one American official told Foreign Policy. \u201cTurkey did not provide any assistance in this operation, and he was located right next to their border,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat shows you how little they do on countering ISIS.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. didn't give its NATO ally many advance details on the raid that killed the ISIS leader.
