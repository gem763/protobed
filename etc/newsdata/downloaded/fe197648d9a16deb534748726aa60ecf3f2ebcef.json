The Senate panel approved a bill sponsored by GOP Senator Marco Rubio of Florida a few hours after the House committee passed a companion bill sponsored by Republican Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely essential that we speak out in regards to what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong,\u201d said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and another one of the Senate bill\u2019s sponsors.\n\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 would also require the president to report to Congress and impose sanctions on the individuals responsible for \u201cabducting and torturing\u201d human rights activists.\n\nChina expressed its objections to the move in a website statement by foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. China will fight back against any U.S. actions that harm China\u2019s national interest, the ministry said.\n\nEach bill will now head to a floor vote in their respective chambers. The swift advancement of both measures underscores the bipartisan support for the protesters in Hong Kong and concerns about China\u2019s reaction to the movement, which has gained momentum since the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, introduced legislation to allow extraditions to China several months ago.\n\nLam has since formally withdrawn the extraditions bill but protests continue. Last week, lawmakers heard from several of the protesters and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her support of the bill. Senator Jim Risch, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has said that Senate Majority Mitch McConnell will allow a floor vote on the bill.\n\n(Updates with China\u2019s response in fifth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Daniel Flatley in Washington at dflatley1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Anna Edgerton, Laurie Ass\u00e9o\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Congressional committees in the House and Senate approved legislation supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, warning China that any crackdown could revoke the city\u2019s special trading status with the U.S.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee", "authors": ["Daniel Flatley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
