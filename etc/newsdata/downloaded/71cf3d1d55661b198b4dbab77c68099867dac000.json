Some have called it the Seinfeld Election (it\u2019s been about nothing); others have lamented the American-style attacks. A Globe and Mail columnist dubbed it \u201cThe Most Depressing Election Campaign Ever.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s going to win?\n\nOf the six party leaders, there are two clear front-runners: Trudeau, 47, and Scheer, 40.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere was much enthusiasm for Trudeau, the bilingual son of longtime Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, when he first won election in 2015. He championed diversity, welcomed refugees, imposed a nationwide price on carbon and legalized recreational cannabis. The unemployment rate is at the lowest in decades.\n\nBut his image has been tarnished in the run-up to the election by scandals, including the revelation that he wore blackface and brownface as a younger man. Trudeau has apologized, but his rivals have seized on the opportunity to paint him as a \u201cphony\u201d who is \u201cnot as advertised.\u201d\n\nScheer, an affable father of five, has struggled to define himself or attract voters outside of his base since winning the party leadership in 2017. He has come under attack for his opposition to abortion and for refusing to say whether he supports same-sex marriage. He has promised not to reopen the debate on either issue and to balance the budget within five years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScheer has also been on the defensive over his personal background. The Globe and Mail reported during the campaign that he misrepresented his experience in the insurance industry on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and revealed that he is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. Scheer said he sought in August to renounce his U.S. citizenship, but critics charged hypocrisy because he once questioned the dual citizenship of Micha\u00eblle Jean, a former Haitian refu\u00adgee who served as governor general, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s representative in Canada.\n\nWho else is running?\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, 40, has seen a bump in support since the campaign began. A practicing Sikh born to immigrant parents from India, he has earned praise for his response to Trudeau\u2019s blackface scandal and for his debate performances. His candidacy has exposed a darker side of Canadian society: At a campaign stop in Montreal, a man suggested he remove his turban so he could \u201clook like a Canadian.\u201d Singh\u2019s left-leaning party could siphon votes away from the Liberals.\n\nElizabeth May, 65, the U.S.-born leader of the Green Party, saw her poll numbers climb to historic highs before the campaign kicked off last month, but the party has since lost momentum. She has promised to create a \u201cwar cabinet\u201d to combat climate change and to phase out fossil fuels by 2030. Her campaign has experienced some embarrassing gaffes, including using Photoshop to show her holding a reusable cup with a metal straw.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois poses a serious threat to the fortunes of the Liberals and Conservatives in Quebec. The resurgent party is led by Yves-Francois Blan\u00e7het, 54, a former rock group manager nicknamed \u201cThe Goon.\u201d He supports a controversial Quebec law that bans public employees from wearing religious symbols at work.\n\nThen there\u2019s Maxime Bernier, 56, the libertarian who founded the hard-right People\u2019s Party of Canada last year after losing the Conservative Party leadership race to Scheer. Bernier has railed against multiculturalism, proposed building a \u201cborder fence\u201d at the U.S.-Canada border and mocked Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg. His new party, however, is struggling, and Bernier, elected to Parliament in 2015 as a Conservative, could lose his seat.\n\nWhat are the issues?\n\nNo single issue has dominated the campaign. The candidates have largely tried to address concerns over affordability in their platforms, with pledges to slash cellphone bills and offer boutique tax credits for middle-class families with children.\n\nOne of the main areas of disagreement is on the environment. Trudeau has promised to commit Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050 but has offered few details on how he\u2019d get there. Scheer, by contrast, says his first order of business as prime minister would be to repeal the Liberal government\u2019s carbon tax. The New Democrats and the Greens have criticized both parties for putting forth inadequate plans on climate change and have attacked Trudeau for buying the Trans Mountain pipeline last year. On climate change, Singh has said, Trudeau and Scheer offer a choice between \u201cMr. Delay and Mr. Deny.\u201d\n\nIf the campaign is remembered for anything, it might be its uncharacteristically nasty tone. Candidates from all sides have participated in the mudslinging. A debate earlier this month quickly devolved into a six-way screaming match. Underscoring the souring of the political climate, Trudeau took the unprecedented step of wearing a bulletproof vest at a rally in Mississauga, Ontario, this month because of a security threat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow do Canadians elect their prime minister?\n\nVoters in each of 338 electoral districts, called ridings, elect a member to represent them in the House of Commons, the lower chamber of Canadian Parliament.\n\nThe suburbs outside Toronto and Vancouver and the province of Quebec are key battlegrounds where elections are won and lost.\n\nCanadians do not vote directly for prime minister. The prime minister is the leader of the party that commands the confidence of the House of Commons \u2014 analogous to the speaker of the House of Representatives in the United States. If a party wins a majority of the seats \u2014 170 or more \u2014 it forms the government and its leader becomes prime minister.\n\nAD\n\nBut polls show neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives are likely to win a majority.\n\nWhat then?\n\nThere would be a minority government \u2014 and it could get complicated.\n\nAD\n\nNo matter the result on Monday, Trudeau will remain prime minister until he resigns or is dismissed. If neither happens, he gets the first crack at forming a new government.\n\nThis is where smaller parties can play kingmaker. Trudeau could try to put together a formal coalition, in which lawmakers from more than one party share cabinet seats, but the last time Canada saw such an arrangement was 1917. More common are informal coalitions, in which the governing party works with other parties to pass bills on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAD\n\nThe first test to see if the government has the confidence of the House is the \u201cSpeech from the Throne.\u201d It\u2019s written by the government to outline its agenda and is then put to a vote. If the government loses the vote, it collapses. The governor general can then ask the other parties to try to form a government or dissolve Parliament, forcing a new election.\n\nAD\n\nThe Conservatives would have few natural allies in a minority government. Singh already has ruled out propping up a Conservative minority government. He said last week he\u2019d \u201cabsolutely\u201d form a coalition with the other parties to block the Conservatives from holding power, but has since retreated from those remarks.\n\nPhilippe Lagass\u00e9, an international relations professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, says much will depend on the difference in seat count between the top two parties. If the Conservatives win by a wide margin, he said, Trudeau will come under \u201cfairly significant\u201d pressure to resign.", "description": "Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer are locked in a tight race; neither is expected to win a majority.", "authors": ["Amanda Coletta"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MzywXTIzJ8OlgvciE7QIjOLsfZ4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ADMELWXRYAI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
