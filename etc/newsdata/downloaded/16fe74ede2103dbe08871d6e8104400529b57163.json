Stewart had dated her Twilight co-star, Robert Pattinson, but the two refused to discuss their relationship publicly. Since the couple broke up in 2013, Stewart has been linked to model Stella Maxwell, St. Vincent, and the French singer Soko, but has never made a big deal about her romantic preferences.\n\nIn an interview with Harper\u2019s Bazaar U.K., Stewart, who stars in the upcoming Charlie\u2019s Angels reboot, discussed her refusal to label her sexuality and how she was told that doing so would hinder her career:\n\n\u201cI was informed by an old-school mentality, which is \u2014 you want to preserve your career and your success and your productivity, and there are people in the world who don\u2019t like you, and they don\u2019t like that you date girls, and they don\u2019t like that you don\u2019t identify as a quote-unquote \u2018lesbian,\u2019 but you also don\u2019t identify as a quote-unquote \u2018heterosexual.\u2019 And people like to know stuff, so what the fuck are you?\u201d\n\nStewart also pointed out that she was once advised not to be affectionate with her girlfriend in public so she could have a chance at playing a superhero. \u201cI have fully been told, \u2018If you just, like, do yourself a favor and don\u2019t go out holding your girlfriend\u2019s hand in public, you might get a Marvel movie,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work with people like that.\u201d (Note from me: I don\u2019t want Kristen Stewart to work with people like that either, but I would kill to see her in a Marvel movie.)\n\nThe 29-year-old actress also praised the way today\u2019s youth tend to refrain from labels, which is something she clearly connects with. \u201cI just think we\u2019re all kind of getting to a place where \u2014 I don\u2019t know, evolution\u2019s a weird thing \u2014 we\u2019re all becoming incredibly ambiguous,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s this really gorgeous thing.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
