What happened prior to that is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nHansen expected Ireland to play to their strengths \u2014 controlling the ball and using scrumhalf Conor Murray to put pressure on the All Blacks\u2019 back three with his tactical kicking.\n\nFlyhalf Johnny Sexton, World Player of the Year in 2018, would also be key for the Irish to keep their pack going forward, he added.\n\n\u201cWhy would they want to change? That\u2019s been very successful for (them),\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any complacency in our camp.\u201d\n\nHansen is stepping down at the end of the World Cup after 16 years with the team as an assistant and head coach. He bristled when asked if that was a factor in his thinking ahead of the quarter-finals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about my All Blacks career,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about that we earn the right to come back on Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even thinking about three (knockout games). We don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to play three. We know that we are only going to play one and that\u2019s all we\u2019re thinking of.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand have lost twice to Ireland in their last three meetings but All Blacks coach Steve Hansen says all form goes out the window ahead of Saturday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final in Tokyo.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440610378&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0E4", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
