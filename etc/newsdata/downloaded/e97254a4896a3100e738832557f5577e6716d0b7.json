Fox News has not seen a copy of the closely guarded book, which is set to be released Oct. 15. Lauer denied the graphic rape claim in a strongly worded letter that his lawyer provided to Fox News on Wednesday, in which the former \u201cToday\u201d co-host said he initially was quiet for the sake of his children -- but will now defend himself.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague,\u201d NBC News said in a statement that was read on air.\n\nHowever, in a letter sent to staff, Lack took issue with Farrow\u2019s claims the network -- which employed him at the time -- attempted to stop him from looking into disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nMATT LAUER CLAIMS SECRET DOOR-LOCKING BUTTON AT NBC OFFICE 'DIDN'T EXIST'\n\n\u201cIn addition to his reporting on Lauer, Farrow\u2019s new book also includes his telling of the NBC News investigation of Harvey Weinstein,\u201d Lack wrote in the memo, obtained by Fox News.\n\n\u201cAs you know, our news organization is filled with dedicated, professional journalists, including some of the best and most experienced investigative reporters, as well as others who support our reporting with exceptional talent, integrity and decency.\n\n\u201cIt disappoints me to say that even with passage of time, Farrow\u2019s account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News. He uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture.\u201d\n\nLack continued: \u201cHere are the essential and indisputable facts:NBC News assigned the Harvey Weinstein story to Ronan, we completely supported it over many months with resources -- both financial and editorial.\n\nFORMER 'TODAY' CO-HOST ANN CURRY BELIEVES LAUER RAPE ACCUSER: IT 'BREAKS MY HEART'\n\n\u201cAfter seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn\u2019t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization.\n\n\u201cNot willing to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by the New York Times, he asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away. Reluctantly, we allowed him to go ahead. Fifty-three days later, and five days after the New York Times did indeed break the story, he published an article at the New Yorker that bore little resemblance to the reporting he had while at NBC News.\u201d\n\nAfter listing some of the sexual scandals covered by the network, Lack wrapped up the note to staff.\n\n\u201cTo get across the finish line on big stories like these takes exceptional work, collaboration, patience, and a commitment to a set of standards and practices that ultimately lends our work great credibility,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMATT LAUER DENIES GRAPHIC RAPE CLAIM, SAYS SEX WITH NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE 'COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL'\n\n\u201cIf you have any questions about the journalistic decisions that were made, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s statement was not the first time Farrow and Lack have disagreed on how the award-winning journalist viewed his freedom to report on Weinstein while with NBC News.\n\nLast year, Farrow fired back at NBC saying the news division produced \u201cnumerous false or misleading statements\u201d when defending the Peacock Network\u2019s handling of his reporting on Weinstein.\n\nFarrow\u2019s statement at the time came after Lack released a 10-page memo, complete with a cover letter and table of contents, addressing allegations by a former NBC News producer -- who was working with Farrow on the Weinstein probe -- that they were ordered to kill the report following directions from \u201cthe very highest levels at NBC.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve avoided commenting on the specifics of NBC\u2019s role in the Weinstein story to keep the focus on the women and their allegations. But executives there have now produced a memo that contains numerous false or misleading statements, so I\u2019ll say briefly: their list of sources is incomplete and omits women who were either identified in the NBC story or offered to be,\u201d Farrow wrote.\n\nLack\u2019s memo fought back against allegations that he tried to kill the story, labeling talk about the network\u2019s handling of the report \"an unusual situation for a news division.\"", "description": "NBC News chairman Andy Lack sent a letter to staffers with the network Wednesday that took issue with reporting in Ronan Farrow\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d", "authors": ["Liam Quinn", "Liam Quinn Is A Senior Editor At Fox News.
