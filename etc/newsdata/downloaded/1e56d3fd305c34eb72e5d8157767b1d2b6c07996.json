As per-episode budgets go, that ranks it alongside Game of Thrones and The Crown as the most expensive TV series of all time, a factoid that might seem ludicrous as this isn\u2019t a period piece or action epic, but a drama set largely inside a TV studio. Does that mean that this kind of price tag will be the norm? And does the show justify it?\n\nThere\u2019s the fact that all of this hallowed glitz is being showered on the day\u2019s trickiest topic: the #MeToo movement. Specifically, The Morning Show, which had been developed as a behind-the-scenes look inside the pressure cooker of morning news, evolved in response to actual news into a scathing rebuke of Matt Lauer and the systemic culture at NBC that coddled his alleged predatory behavior at the expense of women\u2019s safety and careers, the network\u2019s reputation, and the sanctity of the business.\n\nAnd though time has stopped being measured in ways as traditional as, well, actual time, it is the major industry swing carrying the increasingly combustible TV business from one decade into the next\u2014and possibly a new era, too.\n\nThree episodes of The Morning Show debut on Apple TV+ on Friday, Nov. 1 and were given to critics to review, with subsequent episodes released on Fridays.\n\nThis has been a long preamble to say that, yes, it is very good. But is it as great as it should be, or needs to be?\n\nAt a time in the industry brimming with unknowns\u2014from how consumers will embrace these new services to the very issues the series is exploring\u2014that may be impossible to answer. And that ambiguity, those unknowns, might just be what everyone is banking on.\n\nThe series begins with a death, of sorts.\n\nThe Morning Show producer Chip Black, played by Mark Duplass, calls the show\u2019s co-anchor, Mitch Kessler, Carell\u2019s character, at 3 a.m. \u201cSomebody better be dead, buddy,\u201d he says. At 3:30, he then calls Alex Levy, played by Aniston, the Katie Couric to Mitch\u2019s Matt Lauer. She ignores the call and all of his repeated attempts, until he finds her outside the studio when she arrives at dawn. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she moans. \u201cWho died?\u201d\n\nIn effect, Mitch did. An article is being published accusing him of serial sexual misconduct. He is immediately fired from the show. Alex is going to have to go on air and address America, reconciling the fact that the man who\u2019s been her on-air partner for over a decade is now, in their eyes, a sexual predator.\n\nThe Matt Lauer parallels are overt. Details are dropped throughout the first three episodes that horrifyingly resemble those reported in investigations, including a button under the desk that closes and locks Mitch\u2019s office door. Also familiar is Mitch\u2019s reaction, furious that he\u2019s being treated as if he\u2019s Harvey Weinstein when he insists that all of his sexual relationships were consensual.\n\n\u201cYou know what? I didn\u2019t rape anybody!\u201d he screams. \u201cI didn\u2019t fire anybody. I didn\u2019t jizz into a plant in front of somebody. You know what I did? I fucked a couple of PAs and assistants. Big fucking deal. They liked it. I mean who are we kidding?\u201d\n\nWith Aniston\u2019s character, Alex, there are echoes of the ways women in these situations are routinely devalued and kept out of the loop.\n\nShe is blindsided by the sexual misconduct news and Mitch\u2019s firing, even though network higher-ups knew about it. While exploring different circumstances, it is reminiscent of how Kelly Ripa was treated when ABC secretly orchestrated Michael Strahan\u2019s promotion off Live With Kelly and Michael. Chip tells Alex she was kept in the dark so she could keep doing \u201cwhat America needs you to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck you, Chip, don\u2019t you drag America into this,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got enough shit to deal with. This affects me. My on-air partner, my TV husband is a sexual predator now. What part of you thought that I should not have been involved in this conversation?\u201d\n\n\u201c Everyone, in not-so-subtle ways, seems to be grieving something bigger: What is happening to journalism? America? To all of us? \u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Reese Witherspoon\u2019s character, a firecracker reporter for a conservative news outlet named\u2014and I\u2019m serious\u2014Bradley Jackson whose life is upended when a clip of her berating a boorish man at a protest goes viral.\n\nThe head of the news division, Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) uses Bradley to make Alex jealous, hoping to drive her off the show. What he doesn\u2019t foresee is that, in an attempt to seize control of the situation, Alex uses Bradley as a pawn for her own gain.\n\nIn some ways, The Morning Show is unexpectedly a series about grief. Carell\u2019s Mitch grieves the loss of his career and the overzealousness of #MeToo. Aniston\u2019s Alex is grieving the loss of her sense of security, and, with it, control. Witherspoon is mourning the loss of her own agency. And everyone, in not-so-subtle ways, seems to be grieving something bigger: What is happening to journalism? America? To all of us?\n\nA morning program is the catalyst for all of this big thinking because it is supposed to be an innocuous safe space, the comfort food. It\u2019s upsetting when your comfort food gets soured, and even worse when it\u2019s the first meal of the day. How do you come back from that?\n\nThe Morning Show isn\u2019t offering comfortable takes on these issues.\n\nCrudup\u2019s Cory cheers what he calls the \u201cMitch-is-a-predator boost\u201d to the ratings, but knows it\u2019s fleeting because \u201cpeople are getting used to their favorite cuddly men turning into monsters.\u201d He\u2019s excited to use it to aid his misogynistic cause: Pushing out Alex, who has gotten \u201cstale.\u201d As he sees it, \u201cWatching a beloved woman\u2019s breakdown is timeless American entertainment.\u201d\n\nMitch likens the way the #MeToo movement has progressed to McCarthyism. Alex grapples with her own power: \u201cSometimes women can\u2019t ask for control, so they have to take it.\u201d Bradley wonders about her place in all of this as a journalist, beholden to the truth, \u201cwhether you\u2019re writing for The Bumfuck Gazette or The New York Times.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a show that will piss off people allergic to earnestness as well as people allergic to showboating. And it will certainly piss off people susceptible to a certain kind of anaphylactic shock when those two approaches collide, like a toxic mixing of medication, in a discussion of #MeToo.\n\nThere are times when the male characters\u2014Carell\u2019s Mitch, Duplass\u2019 Chip, Martin Short\u2019s Woody Allen-esque director\u2014are discussing the escalation of #MeToo and characterizing the accused men as victims of witch hunts when it\u2019s unclear if the show is attempting both-sides nuance of a worthwhile argument, or simply venting the frustrations of embittered, threatened men.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a series that\u2019s constantly venting: about journalism, about #MeToo, about sexism, about misogyny, about power, about Americans. There\u2019s a sliding scale with gratifying on one end and exhausting on the other, and The Morning Show is constantly veering from one end to the other. There\u2019s fun to be had in that. There\u2019s also annoyance.\n\n\u201c People are getting used to their favorite cuddly men turning into monsters. \u201d\n\nThere are almost constant whiffs of very classy, intelligent people poking and prodding and preaching at you. When these arguments are as provocative and insightful as the creative team seems to believe, it\u2019s fantastic. Delivered by a cast this stacked, how could it not be? But when it misses, the groan may as well be a foghorn. It can seem like a fool\u2019s errand to engage in these issues in real-time, which is what makes the show both so impressive and susceptible to intense criticism.\n\nIn that sense, it\u2019s a melodrama at a time when TV seems to have moved away from that, making it all the more peculiar and, in turn, fascinating that this is the tone of a show meant to herald the streaming service of the future.\n\nWhatever you make of all this, there are aspects of the series that are undeniable. This is Jennifer Aniston\u2019s show, bar none, and she\u2019s seizing it. She\u2019s fantastic. The high-octane nature of the narrative is such that every character is on the verge of blowing a gasket, but no one does that better than Aniston.\n\nShe gets her moments of levity, which, the comedy talent she is, she nails. But while her strength has always been in making kookiness alluring and magnetic, this is the most captivating she\u2019s ever been in a dramatic role. She gets her very own Network-inspired \u201cmad as hell\u201d speech, spun through a feminist filter about male power and ego, that is outlandish and, yet, incredibly entertaining.\n\nCasting Carell, as beloved as ever at the moment thanks to the streaming popularity of The Office, in a role like this is a stroke of genius, even if he\u2019s not given as much to do. And Witherspoon is entertaining, though Bradley\u2019s self-described feistiness loses its zeal as she loses just about all of her agency.\n\nThe Alex and Bradley All About Eve-style plot cycles through every stage of retrograde to empowering, and familiar to surprising. But that\u2019s what\u2019s most striking about The Morning Show. Its approach to a host of volatile issues isn\u2019t singular, or easy, or even, it seems at times, aimed at actual targets. Reflecting a society with passionate opinions about these issues falling all across the board, maybe it knows there\u2019s no such thing as crystallizing them all into a bullseye.\n\nThe irony is, though, we\u2019re also at a time culturally and in the industry when bullseyes are required, especially when you\u2019re talking about issues like these, or when you\u2019re heralding a new TV era like this one is supposed to usher in.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to gauge, then, what The Morning Show\u2019s impact will be. It\u2019s good enough, and will start conversations. But in unforgiving times, what happens to a slight miss? For better and worse, that seems like a question the show itself would try to explore.", "description": "Apple TV+\u2019s debut drama starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon is elegant, timely, and preachy, for better and worse.
