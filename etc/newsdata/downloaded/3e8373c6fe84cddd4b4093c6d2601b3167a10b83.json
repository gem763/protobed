His support was even more resounding in the primary election: There, Mr. Trump captured 82 percent of the vote against his fellow Republicans.\n\nBut the district has occasionally supported Democrats. In 2012, President Barack Obama narrowly won Staten Island. And last year, Mr. Rose defeated the Republican incumbent, Dan Donovan, by almost seven points, or about 12,000 votes, buoyed by the more liberal enclaves on Staten Island\u2019s North Shore, as well as the southern rim of Brooklyn, which makes up a slice of the district.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Nyregion Impeachment-House-Max-Rose.Html"], "top_image": ""}
