Adam Schiff\u2019s \u2018fictional retelling\u2019 of the Trump call transcript was so shameless he later admitted it was \u2018parody\u2019 [video]", "language": "en", "text": "During his opening statement at a House Intelligence Committee hearing featuring testimony from acting DNI Joseph Maguire, Rep. Adam Schiff clearly wanted those watching (and the media subsequently reporting what he said) to believe he was reading directly from the call transcript, but instead Schiff was in fact taking liberties \u2014 and lots of them:\n\nAdam Schiff is now doing a fictional retelling of the transcript. This is bizarre. \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) September 26, 2019\n\nIn opening statement, Rep. Schiff makes up dialogue to represent what Trump said to Zelensky. A rough transcript of the president's words exists, and is available, but Schiff's version is more dramatic. pic.twitter.com/f7gS4KIPge \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) September 26, 2019\n\nSchiff\u2019s reputation as one of the most shameless members of Congress remains untarnished:\n\nThe Ukraine Call Transcript was so damning that Adam Schiff had to completely rewrite it and make up quotes that weren\u2019t in it.pic.twitter.com/bkB6RxLFjV \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 26, 2019\n\nRep. Schiff re-writes the call transcript for added drama: \"I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good, I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it, on this and on that, I\u2019m going to put you in touch with people\" pic.twitter.com/1rV7BpEN6o \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 26, 2019\n\nTake some liberties with the truth much, Congressman Schiff?\n\nSchiff is a great help to Trump. Always has been. \u2014 David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) September 26, 2019\n\nDisinformation alert \u2013> Schiff uses phrase \"the essence of what the president communicates\" as disclaimer & then MAKES UP ludicrous dialogue followed by 2nd disclaimer \"This is in sum and character of what the president was trying to communicate.\" No, read the transcript. https://t.co/mQyg0tNMqU \u2014 Diana West (@diana_west_) September 26, 2019\n\nYou must remember that if Democrats can redefine \"marriage\" and \"man\" and \"woman\" then redefining the actual words on a page isn't much of a jump https://t.co/vpilBLLWBu \u2014 Peter Ingemi (@DaTechGuyblog) September 26, 2019\n\nSchiff knows that a lot of people watching will think that's actually what the transcript said. It's not. In fact, the WHOLE POINT is that the transcript DOESN'T say what Schiff just said it said. \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) September 26, 2019\n\nSchiff knows the media won\u2019t bother to \u201cfact check\u201d what he said. And then, nearly a half hour after his initial BS, Schiff felt compelled to point something out:\n\nAdam Schiff tries to clarify his fake account of President Trump\u2019s call to Ukraine during his opening statement, says it was \u201cparody.\u201d \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) September 26, 2019\n\nI can't believe what I'm watching right now! When confronted about making up a transcript, Adam Schiff countered \"it was meant to be parody.\" This is a hearing before the UNITED STATES CONGRESS, and Schiff uses parody as a mechanism to completely misconstrue @realDonaldTrump?! \u2014 Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) September 26, 2019\n\nWonder how this hearing would've played had Schiff not set it on fire with that weird 'parody' that forced him twenty minutes later to go on the mic and make clear he was just joking, because it's all a joke. \u2014 Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) September 26, 2019\n\nMan, what an idiotic move that turned out to be from Schiff. Who on earth told him that would be remotely appropriate? \u2014 Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) September 26, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s the video:\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff (CA) admits that his blatant fabrication of quotes from Trump's Ukraine call was \"wrong\" after he got called out Schiff claims it was a \"parody\" Impeachment is a politically polarizing event and Schiff thinks it's just a big joke Absolutely unreal pic.twitter.com/YqcQscCKYt \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 26, 2019\n\nWe also agree that Schiff is a parody of a congressman. But the media will continue to take him seriously.", "description": "\"I can't believe what I'm watching right now!\"", "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Schiffreading.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
