However, the national team have fluctuated between second and fourth in the world rankings with Australia retaining an iron grip at the top.\n\nConnolly, who has held various positions with the governing body since 2001, says she wants to see England take that No 1 spot while continuing netball\u2019s role as \u201ctrailblazers\u201d in women\u2019s sport.\n\n\u201cAs a sport we\u2019ve been on an incredible journey and have experienced remarkable success over recent years,\u201d she told Telegraph Sport. \u201cHowever, I truly believe we\u2019ve only just scratched the surface of the potential that netball has.\n\n\u201cI want us to be the top-ranked netball nation in the world and winning regularly in the major championships that matter: the World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. We\u2019ve started to see that and I want us to be consistent. We no longer just want to get to the final, we want to win it.", "description": "England Netball\u2019s new chief executive has targeted becoming the top-ranked nation in the world and insisted the country has \u201conly just scratched the surface\u201d of the sport\u2019s potential.", "authors": ["Ben Bloom"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/netball/2019/10/30/000494-154-Edit-660x375-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXDKPjk80iF35_MRbqSy8cFEOqK6dz3nMqXqhrQnQFPY.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
