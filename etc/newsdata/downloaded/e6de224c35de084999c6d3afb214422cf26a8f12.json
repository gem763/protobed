And according to a new Vanity Fair report, some traders may have been frontrunning new developments.\n\nAccording to the magazine, some traders were suspiciously well-positioned ahead of huge swings in the trade war, either by buying or selling hundreds of thousands of electronically traded futures contracts, called \u201ce-minis\u201d on the S&P 500.\n\nThe magazine noted that on September 10, a trader or group of traders bought 82,000 e-minis in the last 10 minutes of trading in New York. In Beijing, it was almost 4 am on September 11 when this happened. A few hours later, the Chinese government announced it would lift tariffs on a range of American products. Markets surged, and the buyer who bought the e-minis made $190 million, Vanity Fair found.\n\nThe magazine quote an unnamed \u201clongtime\u201d Chicago Mercantile Exchange trader as saying: \u201cThere is definite hanky-panky going on, to the world\u2019s financial markets\u2019 detriment. This is abysmal.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a representative for the CME told Vanity Fair that the trades in question didn\u2019t originate from a single source and are of no concern to the exchange.\n\nMarkets Insider has reported about the market impact of Trump\u2019s tweets \u2013 Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs both analyzed trade-related tweets to see how much they moved markets, with the former creating the Volfefe index, a bot designed to analyze the movement of the stock market.\n\nRead more: Ray Dalio warns the White House\u2019s latest plan to clamp down on Chinese investment could soon become a reality.

He emerged an hour after saying that trade war talks were \u201cback on track.\u201d That week, the stock market surged, and whoever made that bet had a profit of $1.8 billion, Vanity Fair calculated.\n\nOn August 23, a Friday, markets were looking glum in the wake of poor trade war news. But the following week, Trump lied saying that trade war talks were going well after a phone call with China. The Chinese said no call happened. Nevertheless, the S&P bounced 80 points and a person who had bought 386,000 e-minis the week before made $1.5 billion, Vanity Fair found.", "description": "Business Insider - Vanity Fair reported on a series of trades that were oddly timed to trade war developments, suggesting that some traders made handsome profits..
