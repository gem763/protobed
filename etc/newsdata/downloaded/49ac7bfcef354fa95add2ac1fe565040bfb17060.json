Anybody? That\u2019s right, it\u2019s the Russians, at least according to Washington\u2019s chief Latin American diplomat.\n\nSpeaking before a congressional committee hearing on Wednesday, State Department diplomat Michael Kozak suggested that \u201cforeign actors\u201d were stoking protests in Chile. Pressed on the statement by Latin-American news agency EFE on Friday, Kozak elaborated further.\n\n\u201cWe have identified on social networks false accounts that emanate from Russia, which are people who pretend to be Chilean, but in reality all the message they are doing is trying to undermine all Chilean institutions and society,\u201d he was quoted on Friday by Chilean media.\n\nThe US govt is blaming Russia for the protests in Chile, what a f--king joke.\n\n\n\nIt's not the Russians fault that Chileans are tired of living in a US client state https://t.co/TMKGkxquxR \u2014 Whitney Webb (@_whitneywebb) October 26, 2019\n\nKozak didn\u2019t provide evidence, but if he did, it likely wouldn\u2019t prove anything. Accusations of Russia\u2019s social media meddling have been chucked around Washington for nearly three years now, and the best that social media \u2018bot hunters\u2019 have managed to come up with is lists of meme posting accounts that they \u201cbelieve\u201d are \u201cpotentially\u201d Kremlin-backed, based on the claims of NATO-backed think tanks, professional \u2018Russiagaters\u2019 and Democrat intelligence officials.\n\nIn Chile, the protests were not sparked by Moscow-based trolls, but by a planned public transport fare hike. They have since evolved into a nationwide show of rage against the neoliberal policies of President Sebastian Pinera, whose proposed reforms have failed to tamp down public anger. At least 19 people have died over the last eight days, and more than 6,000 have been arrested, as protests descended into riots and clashes with police.\n\n\u201cChile has a constitutional problem in terms of laws in terms of assigning a budget to the social sector and the non-social sector,\u201d political analyst Francisco Coloane told RT. \u201cThere is a very strong pressure from the private sector not to make structural change.\u201d\n\nAs the country\u2019s first right-wing president since the end of US-backed dictator Augusto Pinochet\u2019s government in 1990, Pinera has previously attempted to privatize Chile\u2019s education system, resulting in student demonstrations in 2011. The country\u2019s pension system, water supply, and healthcare system are all fully or almost fully privatized.\n\nThe result is a country that enjoys Latin America\u2019s highest per-capita income, yet the highest inequality in the OECD.\n\nBut why dig into systemic factors and risk undermining the neoliberal consensus? Better to dust off the tinfoil hat and blame Russia instead.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
