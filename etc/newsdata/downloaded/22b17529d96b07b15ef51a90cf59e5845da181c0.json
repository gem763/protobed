Adverse market conditions were thought to be the reason for the purported cooling-off.\n\nClinton Brown, Rockdale Lead Project Manager for Bitmain, has today said the facility\u2019s launch is \u201csignificant to Bitmain's global expansion plans\u201d and that the state\u2019s stable and efficient energy resources will be fundamental to supporting what he believes is set to be the inevitable scale of growth of the mining industry.", "description": "Chinese cryptocurrency hardware manufacturer Bitmain has opened what it claims is the \u201cworld\u2019s largest\u201d facility for Bitcoin mining, in Rockdale, Texas", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMTA4MzMyYmZmYjUyZDhiYzQwMjY3NzI1YTJlZGM2MzIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
