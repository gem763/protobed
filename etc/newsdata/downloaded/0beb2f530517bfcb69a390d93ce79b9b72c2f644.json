And they knew when they found them that this was no ordinary find.\n\n'They soon learned it was not simply treasure but a hoard of very valuable coins.\n\n'Such a quantity of coins of this kind would attract collectors from all over the world.\n\n'They decided to treat the find as theirs and not to declare it to the landowner, the tenant farmer and the coroner. In short, they stole it.\n\n'The hoard included a ring which has been looked at by a very eminent specialist from the British Museum who can tell us this is a ring from the ninth century. So a very ancient ring.\n\n'There was also a crystal ball with some very fancy goldwork strips around it. It would have been worn as a pendant. This is from the fifth to sixth century.\n\n'There was a large bracelet, the sort of thing that would have been worn on the upper arm.\n\n'This is something which would have been made in the ninth century. There was a silver ingot, often used for melting down. It dates from the ninth century.\n\n'You will see images of 30 coins but it's the prosecution's case there were many more coins recovered by Powell and Davies, and all we have is a fraction of what was gathered together 1,100 years ago.\n\n'On some of the coins you can see a lozenge shape sitting within a cross. This is known as a cross and lozenge.\n\n'The size of each coin is that of a one penny piece. Another type of coin has what looks like two heads. This is known as a two emperor. Two emperors are of great value.\n\n'There is also a Louis the Pious coin, a very ancient coin from Iran and a silver penny.\n\nAnother of the accused is pictured on his way into Worcester Crown Court today\n\n'The coins came from two separate areas of England. Some are from the time of King Alfred who at that stage was the King of Wessex.\n\n'Others are from a king you may not have heard of - Ceolwulf.\n\n'At the time Davies and Powell were digging in the ground at Eye Court Farm, they took some pictures and its those pictures that were subsequently recovered and show there were far more than 30 coins in the ground.\n\n'It's estimated there are something like 300 coins. Powell and Davies did not tell the farmers but they did tell Wells, who had an interest in such items.'\n\nMr Hegarty said Powell, Davies and Wells took the items to an antiques dealer and conducted their own internet research to establish the value of the items.\n\nGeorge Powell, who also found the coins, is pictured from behind outside Worcester Crown Court today\n\nEmails show they were aware of the Treasure Act, which states they must declare buried treasure, but Mr Hegarty said they did not do so.\n\nThe court heard Powell and Davies together with Wicks went about selling the items to a variety of individuals and organisations, including more than 20 coins to auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb.\n\nAround 30 coins plus the jewellery have been recovered by police from the various people the defendants sold to as well as from their home addresses.\n\nWicks had even hidden some of the coins within the handle of a magnifying glass, jurors were told.\n\nBut Mr Hegarty said the rest of the hoard could still be at large and may never be brought back together again.\n\nHe added: 'If there were 300 coins, including five two emperors and all the rest were cross and lozenge, the value would be \u00a33 million.\n\n'The items of jewellery you may think invaluable due to their rarity.'\n\nThe court heard Powell and Davies were arrested and questioned in August 2015 and then again in June 2016.\n\nWells was arrested on September 10, 2015, while Wicks was arrested in November 2015.\n\nPowell, of Newport, Wales, and Davies, of Pontypridd, Wales, have pleaded not guilty to theft.\n\nPowell, Davies, Wells, of Rumney, Cardiff, and Wicks, of Hailsham, East Sussex, deny conspiracy to conceal criminal property.\n\nPowell, Davies and Wicks deny conspiracy to convert criminal property - namely by selling it.\n\nThe trial, which is due to last a month, will resume tomorrow.", "description": "George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, found 300 coins, a gold ring, a bracelet, a ninth century silver ingot and a fifth century crystal ball pendant in Hertfordshire.
