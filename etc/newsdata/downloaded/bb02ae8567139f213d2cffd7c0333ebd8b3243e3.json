Friends said the pair were inseparable.\n\nMr Sinnott's devastated partner Kyara Rowland said she recently found out she was pregnant.\n\n(Image: MEN WS)\n\n\"He was so excited,\" she said. \"We had the scan dates, he couldn't wait.\"\n\nKyara, 24, added: \"They met up and went for a drive.\n\n\"I was in bed. I woke up and the police came to see me.\n\n\"I went to his flat. I didn't believe the police; I just couldn't believe it.\n\n\"I honestly feel so lost without him.\"\n\nMusician Andrew liked to be called 'AJ' or 'Malum Lux' - his performing name.\n\nHe composed drum and bass tracks and put on music nights.\n\n(Image: MEN WS)\n\nIn a Facebook post, Kyara wrote: \"I'm absolutely heartbroken to even tell everyone this way, but at 1am yesterday morning, AJ, my gorgeous boyfriend passed away.\n\n\"I honestly have never felt heartbreak so bad and have so much love for his family and friends.\n\n\"Thank you for all being there for him and for all keeping him happy.\n\n\"I've honestly never loved this hard and to lose it all in one night without knowing is the worst.\n\n\"He was so intelligent and an amazing dad, music artist, DJ and partner.\n\n\"He put others first before himself he had the biggest heart and was so funny.\n\n\"I just wish I could tell you 'I love you' one more time and hug you one more time.\n\n(Image: MEN WS)\n\n\"You honestly made me feel safe and loved - I couldn't ask for a better partner.\n\n\"I love you sausage. I just wish I was there to stop you from going out that night.\"\n\nSpeaking about having a child without her partner, Kyara said she was 'so frightened', but said she would 'bring up his beautiful baby in his memory'.\n\nKyara, paying tribute to Mr Ennis, posted: \"RIP, Keith. You [were] the loveliest of people. Sleep tight.\"\n\nMatt Tierney - a friend of both men - said: \"They were so close. They really were special people.\n\n\"They just sparked off each other.\n\n\"Keith found it hard to get on with other people, but not with AJ. They had a special bond.\n\n\"It's really gut-wrenching what's happened. It's so tragic.\n\n(Image: MEN WS)\n\n\"Keith was a very well-liked person. He had an amazing sense of humour. You could sit with him and he would make you laugh.\n\n\"I told him he'd missed his calling as a stand up.\"\n\nFriend Mark Norcliffe added: \"Keith was one of the most inspiring free thinkers I have ever met.\n\n\"He stood for truth and knowledge and was extremely wise and opinionated.\n\n\"He loved playing guitar and indie music. AJ was extremely popular in Manchester and an upcoming drum and bass DJ and producer whose charm and wit was second to none.\"\n\nGreater Manchester Police said in a statement on Sunday: \"Officers were called to reports of a collision shortly after 1.30am on Sunday 6 October on Bury Old Road, Whitefield.\n\n\"A silver Vauxhall Astra had collided with a road sign, resulting in the car hitting a nearby wall.\n\n\"There were two men in the car, one man sadly died at the scene. The second man was taken to hospital and despite the best efforts of emergency staff, was also sadly pronounced dead a short time later.\"", "description": "Andrew Sinnott, 30, and Keith Ennis, 39, both died in the smash in Whitefield, Greater Manchester", "authors": ["Todd Fitzgerald", "Image", "Men Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536047.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RIP-Dad-to-be-killed-with-best-pal-in-crash-just-after-learning-girlfriend-was-pregnant.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
