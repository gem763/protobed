REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - A euro zone economic rebound is not in sight and imported weakness risks infecting the domestic euro zone economy, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Monday, justifying the bank\u2019s fresh stimulus scheme unveiled earlier this month.\n\nEuro zone business growth stalled in September, fresh data showed earlier, dragged down by shrinking activity in Germany, the bloc\u2019s economic engine, where a manufacturing recession deepened unexpectedly.\n\n\u201cRecent data and forward-looking indicators \u2013 such as new export orders in manufacturing \u2013 do not show convincing signs of a rebound in growth in the near future and the balance of risks to the growth outlook remains tilted to the downside,\u201d Draghi told the European Parliament\u2019s committee on economic affairs.\n\nThe ECB cut rates to record lows two weeks ago, unveiled plans to restart debt purchases and kept the door open to more rates cuts in the hope of lowering borrowing costs with the aim of stimulating spending, growth and ultimately inflation.\n\nDraghi said that services, the backbone of the domestic economy, appeared to remain resilient for now but would not be indefinitely immune to troubles in export-focused sectors.\n\n\u201cThe longer the weakness in manufacturing persists, the greater the risks that other sectors of the economy will be affected by the slowdown,\u201d Draghi added.\n\nRelated Coverage Draghi confident of ECB buying Greek bonds if progress made\n\nWith the ECB having used up much of its firepower to fight off weak growth, Draghi repeated his calls for fiscal policy to play a bigger role, relieving monetary policy.\n\nHe also pointed to the benefits of a centralized fiscal instrument, like the federal budget in the United States, as a key tool to smoothing the business cycles.\n\n\u201cThe ECB does not operate in a vacuum and other economic policies matter too,\u201d Draghi said. \u201cIn other words, we need a coherent economic strategy in the euro area that complements and enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy.\u201d", "description": "A euro zone economic rebound is not in sight and imported weakness risks infecting the domestic euro zone economy, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Monday, justifying the bank's fresh stimulus scheme unveiled earlier this month.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432970691&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M16L", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
