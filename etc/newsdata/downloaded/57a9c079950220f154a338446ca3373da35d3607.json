Well they came in their thousands for the finale of the Road World Championships and, despite the appalling conditions that led to the men\u2019s road race being rerouted, remained in buoyant mood throughout a very soggy day in North Yorkshire.\n\nAlmost 200 riders from 42 nations set out from Leeds on Sunday morning. Just 46 finished. There was though only one that took home the coveted rainbow jersey: Mads Pedersen, the 23-year-old from Denmark. Matteo Trentin, of Italy was runner-up with Swiss rider Stefan K\u00fcng taking the bronze.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unbelievable for the nation, we\u2019ve finally got the jersey,\u201d Pedersen said after becoming the first Dane to win the men's title.\n\n\u201cYou had to be focused all day and stay in the front all the time. But it\u2019s one of the last races of the season, so it\u2019s all about keeping that focus for 6\u00bd hours and don\u2019t have any bad luck and hope for the best.\n\n\u201cThis is every rider\u2019s dream to wear this jersey. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nHeavy overnight downpours forced race organisers to take out 23.5km out of what had been scheduled to be the longest men\u2019s road race in the history of the championships while two key climbs \u2013 Buttertubs Pass and Grinton Moor \u2013 were removed. Few would claim the adjustments made it any easier. Indeed, it turned out to be one of the most brutish world championship road races in recent memory.", "description": "Come to Yorkshire, they said.", "authors": ["John Macleary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cycling/2019/09/29/TELEMMGLPICT000211366641-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoYVeM9g2GLs1v936I3-YdsRGCQbLXHwS_O6dAQrEvL0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
