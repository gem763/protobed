The Fox News host played clips of Thunberg\u2019s United Nations speech imploring political leaders to take climate change seriously, remarking, \u201cDoes anyone else find that chilling?\u201d\n\nShe then played a clip from the 1984 horror film Children of the Corn \u2014 based on the Stephen King story in which a religious cult of children ritually murder adults \u2014 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for Stephen King\u2019s sequel, Children of the Climate.\u201d\n\nHere is Laura Ingraham comparing Greta Thunberg to Children of the Corn and saying, \"I can't wait for Stephen King's sequel, Children of the Climate.\" pic.twitter.com/yyPYkeRIMY \u2014 Amee Vanderpool (@girlsreallyrule) September 24, 2019\n\nHer comparison of Thunberg to the film\u2019s murderous children outraged critics \u2014 none more so than her own brother, Curtis Ingraham. The conservative commentator\u2019s older sibling condemned her \u201cmonstrous behavior\u201d and accused her of caring more about her \u201cpaycheck\u201d than her three children. Ingraham\u2019s daughter was born in Guatemala, while her two sons are Russian.\n\nClearly my sister\u2019s paycheck is more important than the world her three adopted kids will inherit. I can no longer apologize for a sibling who I no longer recognize. I can and will continue to call out the monstrous behavior and the bully commentary born out of anger. https://t.co/afrSuraQqt \u2014 Curtis Ingraham (@CurtisIngraham1) September 24, 2019\n\nThe elder sibling has been outspoken about his famous sister in the past, calling her a \u201cmonster\u201d and \u201chypocrite\u201d in an interview with The Daily Beast last year. An openly gay man, he also challenged her views on same-sex marriage, and has tweeted fierce criticisms about her \u201cshameful\u201d politics. She responded by telling The Daily Beast that \u201cmy siblings and I are shocked and saddened to learn of these false and hurtful online postings.\u201d\n\nThe doomsday clock is ticking...we expose the agenda, and who\u2019s really behind it. \u2066@FoxNews\u2069 #IngrahamAngle pic.twitter.com/n2QDkT9RKM \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve been estranged from him for many years, we love our brother and miss him very much,\u201d she added at the time.\n\nThe older Ingraham, who has not yet responded to Yahoo\u2019s request for comment, also called on sponsors of his \u201cbully\u201d sister\u2019s show to take action.\n\nAs if mocking Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg was not enough, my sister is now taking aim at youth champion for the planet Greta Thunberg? Who are the sponsors continuing to support the bully? @davidhogg111 @IngrahamAngle \u2014 Curtis Ingraham (@CurtisIngraham1) September 24, 2019\n\nLaura Ingraham has not yet publicly responded to his comments.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "description": "Curtis Ingraham lashed out after his Fox News host sister called the teen climate change activist \"chilling.\"", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R0aHw_ODSBrxglN58Hpz0g--~B/aD0yMDExO3c9MzAxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-11/168c7ea0-e299-11e8-9fff-19cacc70f831", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
