Eat well. Get enough sleep. Exercise. But sometimes pressuring your teen to diet or lose weight may end up harming them, a new study suggests.\n\nIt found that parents who urge their kids to diet might actually be boosting their odds for obesity later in life. It\u2019s also tied to an increased risk for eating disorders.\n\nThe phenomenon can even stretch across generations, said study lead author Jerica Berge, professor and vice chair for research in the department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\u201cThis new study was conducted over many years, and we can see that these messages stay with someone longitudinally \u2014 someone who had [experienced] it now does that to their kid, passing it on, giving it to the next generation,\u201d said Berge.\n\nOne expert who works with kids who battle eating disorders wasn\u2019t surprised by the findings.\n\n\u201cWe work with young people with serious eating disorders, and we work very closely with parents,\u201d said Ana Ojeda, a clinical psychologist specializing in pediatric patients at Nicklaus Children\u2019s Hospital in Miami.\n\n\u201cSome of our kids are hospitalized,\u201d explained Ojeda, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new study. \u201cWhen you combine eating disorders with depression, anxiety or their own body image, it can lead to very bad consequences. We definitely do not encourage parents to make a foolish focus on a child\u2019s weight. At certain developmental stages, it can be very damaging to self-esteem.\u201d\n\nIn the study, Berge\u2019s group looked at data from surveys completed by more than 1,100 adolescents from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area from 1998 to 1999. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed were girls.\n\nThe respondents then filled out follow-up surveys at five-year intervals beginning in 2003, until they entered their 30s.\n\nBy the third survey, more than 40 percent of young women and 27 percent of young men said they received encouragement from their mothers to diet to stay slim. About 20 percent of young females and 18 percent of young males said they\u2019d gotten similar messages from their dads.\n\nThe study couldn\u2019t prove a direct cause-and-effect, but parental pressure to get and stay slim was associated with poorer health in young adulthood, the study found. There seemed to be a cumulative effect on adult behaviors centered on weight, weight-related behaviors and psychosocial well-being, the Minneapolis team found.\n\nFor example, by the end of the study \u2014 15 years after the first questionnaires had been filled out \u2014 girls who\u2019d been pressured to diet had a 49 percent higher odds of being an obese young adult compared to girls who hadn\u2019t gotten that parental pressure. Boys who had a similar experience had a 13 percent higher odds of becoming obese young men, the researchers reported.\n\nWhen it came to what the researchers called \u201cextreme weight control behaviors,\u201d parental pressure to diet boosted the odds for girls by 29 percent and for boys by 12 percent, Berge\u2019s group found. Risks for binge eating, specifically, rose by 17 percent for girls and 39 percent for boys.\n\nMessages about dieting from parents were also linked to a higher odds for poor self-esteem, body satisfaction and depression in young adulthood.\n\nNone of this means that parents who encourage dieting are trying to make their kids unhappy or unhealthy, Berge stressed.\n\n\u201cParents are well-meaning and doing the best for their kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want them to be as healthy as possible, but they often undermine themselves with the language they use, making a kid feel guilty or ashamed and much more less able to change, because they feel about bad about themselves internally.\u201d\n\nAs Berge explained, there is a better way.\n\n\u201cIf you say something about someone\u2019s weight, it\u2019s internalized as shaming, and it doesn\u2019t lead to behavior change,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to refocus people\u2019s language on eating health. We relate it to something kids like to do. If your kid likes soccer, focus on the fact that eating right can help you run faster on the team. Whatever is of interest to your teen, hone in on that and tell them eating well is for that purpose, not focusing on weight.\u201d\n\nHow can parents prevent their good intentions to keep from backfiring?\n\nRebecca Puhl is deputy director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. Reviewing the findings, she agreed that \u201cthere are better ways for parents to communicate [about weight] with teens.\u201d\n\nFirst off, \u201cwhat parents do is more powerful than what they say,\u201d she stressed.\n\n\u201cParents who create a home environment where healthier choices are easier to make \u2014 fruits and vegetables are available, minimizing junk food, modeling healthy behaviors themselves \u2014 are more likely to be effective, rather than telling your teen she or he needs to lose weight,\u201d Puhl said.\n\nBerge believes that it also helps families to focus on health and eating as a unit.\n\n\u201cEngage the family around it, rather than Mommy saying, \u2018stop this,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHave a good culture in the family around eating. Communicate in a way that promotes healthy eating, not blame.\n\n\u201cWe need to be modeling what\u2019s right for our own bodies,\u201d Berge said. \u201cAnd communicating to children that what\u2019s far more important is their contribution and character than what they look like or the number on the scale.\u201d\n\nThe study was published recently in the Journal of Adolescent Health.\n\nMore information\n\nThere\u2019s more on kids and obesity at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCopyright 2019 HealthDay.
