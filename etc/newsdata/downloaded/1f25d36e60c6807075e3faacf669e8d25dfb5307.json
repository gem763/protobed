It's up to you what your ethics are on it but I'm saying that what you're trying to do is is get used to approaching.'\n\nAnother of the coaches, who is in his late twenties, is then shown approaching two young women and telling her that she's 'not a child' at 16-years-old.\n\nGreeting the teenagers, he says: 'We come in peace - I'm here with my friends from Scotland. You girls look very nice, interesting.'\n\nOne of the coaches for the group Street Attraction encouraged Myles to approach a woman that he thought was underage (pictured, one of the coaches)\n\nLooking bemused, the older of the two girls says: 'She's a child and I have a boyfriend.'\n\nSpeaking to the younger girl, the coach asks: 'When you say child do you mean like 16 or 17?'.\n\nWhen she confirms her age, he replies: '16? That's not a child. Do you feel like a child or do you feel like a teenager?'\n\nAnother part of the bootcamp involves the group loitering around clothes shops and looking out for potential targets.\n\nEmily, from Glasgow, said she was disturbed when she was approached by a man in the street who secretly filmed their encounter\n\nOne of the coaches warns Myles to pretend to be looking at clothes, as he is worried security guards would notice them 'standing there like predators looking at all the girls'.\n\nSpeaking to a colleague on the phone, one of the coaches says: 'They're hiding in the shops that's where they're at.'\n\nHe turned to Myles and continues: 'Just stay away from the security guards - their job is to be super nosy.'\n\nThe programme followed the group as they coached men 'how to seduce' women, including loitering in clothes shops waiting for girls\n\nUndercover journalist Myles asks: 'Is it a problem for us kind of being in here?'\n\nHe replies: 'No, no it's not I'm just saying in general with security guards their job is to be nosy.\n\nHe adds: 'If we're just standing there it looks suspicious. We're not looking at any of the clothes, we're not shopping, we're just standing there like predators looking at all the girls.'\n\nSecrets of the Seduction Bootcamp, which airs tonight on BBC1 at 8.30pm", "description": "A new\u00a0BBC One Panorama documentary  has shown the shocking moment a group of so-called 'seduction coaches' are seen approaching a 16-year-old girl while on the street with her sister.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/14/19361138-0-image-a-14_1570367213991.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
