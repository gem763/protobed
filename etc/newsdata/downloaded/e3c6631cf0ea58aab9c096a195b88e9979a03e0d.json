What we think is The Ghost.\n\nHere\u2019s the clip with the shot. Look on the right.\n\nNew trailer tease promo for Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker ! #StarWars #TheRiseOfSkywalker pic.twitter.com/syZHH7PsZm \u2014 Zcure1 (@Zcure1) October 21, 2019\n\nNow, that\u2019s almost certainly the Ghost. Not a Force Ghost, THE Ghost. What\u2019s the Ghost?\n\nIt\u2019s the customised VCX-100 light freighter flown by Captain Hera Syndulla, which was kind of the Millennium Falcon of Star Wars Rebels. Later, it appeared in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and, thanks to the epilogue of Rebels, we knew it survived until the timeline of the sequel trilogy.\n\nNow, it seems the Ghost, and probably even Hera herself, are standing with the Falcon in what we can only assume is the Resistance\u2019s final stand against the First Order.\n\n(And yes, we have to admit maybe it\u2019s not THE Ghost. It could be just another version of that ship. But come on! It has to be, right?)\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Also spotted in this epic shot are Nebulons, Brah\u2019atoks, U-Wings, Lucrehulks, MC75s, Nebulon Bs, Sphyrna-Classes (aka the Hammerhead Cruiser from Knights of the Old Republic), what looks like a Baleen-class heavy freighter (the ship Han Solo and Chewie have in The Force Awakens), a Defender Class Corvette, maybe even a YT-2400 light freighter, Lancer-class pursuit craft, a MG-100 StarFortress SF-17, a Vakbeor-class cargo frigate, a Free Virgillia-class Bunkerbuster, and many, many more. All of which are real things on Wookieepedia if you want to check.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to say the shot is \u201cspaceship porn\u201d but, well, we just did.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker opens December 19, and the trailer debuts today during halftime of America's Monday Night Football on ESPN.", "description": "The final trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is still a few hours away but one of its first secrets has already been revealed.
