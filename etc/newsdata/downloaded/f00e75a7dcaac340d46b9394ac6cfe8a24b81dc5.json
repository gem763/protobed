Rowling: Don't Give Your Time or Money to Orphanages", "language": "en", "text": "This is a lightly edited transcript of remarks by J.K. Rowling at the One Young World global forum in London on Oct. 24. The author was speaking at the launch of #HelpingNotHelping, a campaign led by her children\u2019s charity Lumos intended to educate young people about the potential harms of orphanage tourism and volunteering.\n\nIn 2004, I read a story about a 6 or 7-year-old boy who was being kept 24 hours at a time in a cage bed, which is effectively a cot with chicken wire around it.\n\nI saw this very disturbing image, and I was pregnant at the time with my third child and think I was feeling particularly hormonal and vulnerable, and Ient to turn the page. I\u2019m not particularly proud of that impulse but it\u2019s important to acknowledge that as humans, some situations are so distressing that you flinch. And so I went to turn the page and I thought \u2018no, you have to read the story and if the story is as bad as the picture looks, you have to do something about it.\u2019\n\nSo I read the story, and it was actually even worse than the picture looks. It talked about an institution where young people with disabilities were being kept, effectively confined to small cells, in an Eastern European country.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Our NGO is named after the light-giving spell in Harry Potter, which we decided was appropriate because what we\u2019re trying to do is reveal children who are often very hidden away and isolated in these so-called orphanages around the world, and work together to release them.\n\nThe reason we don\u2019t have orphanages in the developed world is we know they do often irreparable harm. We understand that institutionalisation is one of the worst things that you can possibly do to a child. We understand it renders children very vulnerable to abuse and trafficking, it has huge effects on their normal development, and it massively impacts their life chances.\n\nOne of the facts that most stunned me when I started listening to this seriously is that eight out of 10 children living in so-called orphanages \u2013 and this statistic applies globally \u2013 are not orphans. Eight out of 10 will have one living parent at least, and overwhelmingly the family did not want to give up the child.\n\nSo why are they in the so-called orphanage? Overwhelmingly, the number one reason is poverty. Then you have natural disasters, and you have disability. Disabled children are greatly over-represented in institutions worldwide, and that will be again not because parents want to give that child up, but because the only hope they have for education and healthcare for that child in that community, is to put them into the so-called orphanage.\n\nAnd then we come to the part that I think we really want to talk about today. The West has, often with the best intentions, funded huge amounts to these so-called orphanages. But another key pillar propping up the orphanage business\u2014and I have to call it that\u2014is people volunteering and visiting orphanages.\n\nIn other words, \u2018volun-tourism\u2019 and orphanage tourism, where you\u2019re taken to see children in an orphanage as part of your travel experience, or when you go believing \u2013 which overwhelmingly people of course believe they\u2019re doing good \u2013 they volunteer for a couple of weeks, or a month.\n\nAnd often these young people will come away believing they did good, and are appalled when the facts are laid out in front of them, and they realize that they may have contributed to the perpetuation of abuse.\n\nThey\u2019ve brought foreign money into the country and we do know that some orphanages are set up literally to exploit children. The children are the bait for foreign donations and a volunteer experience, and the money is going into the pockets of the people running the orphanages.\n\nHowever, we do have some hope.\n\nThere seems to be a tipping point being reached where governments are acknowledging now that institutionalisation is profoundly damaging to children, which is wonderful. And we are thrilled that the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office has amended its travel advice to warn people of the harms of \u2018volun-tourism\u2019. It\u2019s massive.\n\nLumos is thrilled to have partnered with Hope and Homes for Children and with the Association of British Travel Agents. We have made an orphanage tourism taskforce and what we are doing there is trying to shift the travel industry from supporting orphanage tourism, and that\u2019s also a big breakthrough.\n\nI suppose I would say there are three big things that people can do watching this.\n\nThe first is and I\u2019m sure by now very obvious, don\u2019t volunteer in orphanages. Don\u2019t give your time to propping up a system that we know does real, serious harm.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the financial aspect. If you have money to give when you are travelling, put it into local businesses because that helps communities. That\u2019s something real you can do when travelling. Don\u2019t go and visit orphanages.\n\nIf you want to support charities or projects, just do a bit of due diligence and make sure you\u2019re dealing with the root causes here: look at poverty and building community services and so on.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019d say, and what we would love to see as an organisation, is to see businesses amending their social responsibility policies. We\u2019d love to see those corporate policies changed to make sure they\u2019re not supporting so-called orphanages or child institutions. That is something hugely powerful that everyone can do.\n\nI know I said three things but I\u2019m going to say a fourth thing. We are looking to educate people because changing the mindset is what is ultimately going to make the difference. If everyone in this hall went out today and spoke to their university, their college, their place of work and friends and family and said \u2018we need to not support this.\u2019\n\nWe know that millions and millions and millions of children are trapped and they are voiceless. The world needs to hear what orphanages are doing to children globally.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The author was speaking at the launch of #HelpingNotHelping, a campaign led by her children\u2019s charity Lumos", "authors": ["J.K.
