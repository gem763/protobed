It comes just as the Trump administration is in the midst of trying to negotiate a resolution to its high-stakes trade war with China.\n\nThe administration received a green light for its latest import taxes Wednesday from the World Trade Organization, which ruled that the United States could impose the tariffs as retaliation for illegal aid that the 28-country EU gave to Airbus in its competition with its American rival Boeing.\n\nThe WTO announcement culminates a 15-year fight over EU subsidies for Airbus.\n\nEU aircraft will face a 10% import tax; other products on the list will be hit with 25% tariffs . The administration insists that it has the authority to increase the tariffs whenever it wants or to later the products in its list.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called the WTO ruling a \u201cbig win for the United States\u201d and asserted that it happened because WTO officials \u201cwant to make sure I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe WTO has been much better to us since I\u2019ve been president because they understand they can\u2019t get away with what they\u2019ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States,\u201d Trump said at a joint White House news conference with President Sauli Niinisto of Finland.\n\nStock markets around the world, which were already down on concerns for the world economy, added to their losses on the news.\n\nWednesday's award follows a WTO ruling in May 2018 that the EU had illegally helped Airbus with subsidies. It does not, however, end the long-running trans-Atlantic dispute over aircraft. WTO arbitrators are expected to rule next year about how much the EU can impose in tariffs following a separate decision that went against Boeing.\n\nThe EU\u2019s top trade official had said the bloc would prefer to reach a settlement with the United States to avoid a tariff war but that it will respond if Trump imposes new duties on EU products.\n\nSpeaking after the WTO\u2019s ruling Wednesday but before the Trump administration announced the new tariffs, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said a tariff war \u201cwould only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. decides to impose WTO authorized countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same,\u201d she said.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, who was meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Rome on Wednesday, vowed to \u201cdefend our businesses.\u201d Italian wine and cheeses could face an impact from U.S. tariffs.\n\nUnlike Trump\u2019s unilateral tariffs on billions of dollars-worth of steel, aluminum and other goods from China, the EU and elsewhere, the retaliatory tariffs authorized in the Airbus case have the stamp of approval from the WTO, an organization that he has repeatedly criticized.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged \u201cwe have lost a matter under WTO law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis means it\u2019s not some sort of arbitrary question but a verdict according to international law that now weighs on Airbus, one must sadly say,\u201d she told reporters in Berlin. \u201cWe have to see how the Americans will react now.\u201d\n\nThe WTO in May 2018 found that EU aid for Airbus had resulted in lost sales for Boeing in the twin-aisle and very large-aircraft markets. The ruling centered on Airbus' 350XWB \u2014 a rival of Boeing's 787 \u2014 and the double-decker A380, which tops the Boeing 747 as the world's largest commercial passenger plane.\n\nAirbus and Boeing dominate the market for large airliners, and Boeing\u2019s deliveries have plummeted this year because of the grounding of its 737 Max jet after two deadly crashes. This limits options for airlines looking to expand their fleets to accommodate increased air travel.\n\nU.S. airlines have argued against tariffs on planes and parts that they buy from Europe, and they have mobilized supporters in Congress. In a letter this week to Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, 34 congressional Republicans and Democrats expressed opposition to tariffs on imported airplanes and parts. And they suggested that if the tariffs were imposed that they apply only to future orders.\n\nThe lawmakers noted that because aircraft orders usually stretch out years, it\u2019s hard for airlines to change or cancel them. Tariffs on European planes \u201cwould simply make these aircraft more expensive ... and would do nothing to encourage the EU to end the illegal subsidies,\u201d they wrote. By contrast, they said, imposing tariffs only on future orders from the EU would give airlines an incentive to buy U.S.-made planes.\n\nThe case itself dates to 2004, a testament to the plodding and thorough rhythm of the Geneva-based trade body.\n\nRod Hunter, a partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie and a former White House economic official, saw three possible outcomes: The EU can end the offending subsidies to Airbus, decide to absorb the tariffs or try to reach a negotiated settlement with the Trump administration.\n\nIn a statement, Lighthizer said, \u201cWe expect to enter into negotiations with the European Union aimed at resolving this issue in a way that will benefit American workers.\u201d\n\nThe $7.5 billion represents a fraction of EU exports to the United States, which last year amounted to $688 billion.\n\nBut the specter of more tariffs comes at a sensitive time. Trump\u2019s aggressive use of tariffs \u2014 especially against China \u2014 has shaken financial markets, hobbled global trade and hurt manufacturers paralyzed with uncertainty about where to buy supplies, situate factories and sell their products. On Tuesday, a private index of U.S. manufacturing output dropped to its lowest level since the recession year 2009.\n\n\u201cThe market effect could be larger than just the impact on the European exports and their U.S. customers,\u2019\u2019 Hunter said.\n\nGary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former U.S. trade official, cast doubt on prospects for a EU-US trade deal that will ease tensions and ward off tit-for-tat tariffs, at least before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cElection years are bad for trade deals,\u2019\u2019 Hufbauer said.\n\nThe WTO is already examining a dozen cases involving U.S. tariffs and countermeasures brought by its trading partners over the administration\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump has insisted the move is needed to protect U.S. national security interests, but the Europeans claim it is simply protectionism and breaks global trade rules.\n\nThe EU has introduced \"rebalancing\" tariffs on about 2.8 billion euros ($3 billion) of U.S. steel, agricultural and other products. Trump has also threatened to slap duties on European automakers.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKeaten reported from Geneva.
