But the first time he sat down to write what he believed would be \u201cthe great British fantasy novel\u201d, it didn\u2019t go well.\n\nGrowing up on David Eddings and Dragonlance, Abercrombie was aiming for full-blown epic fantasy when he made a stab at his own novel in his early 20s. He managed a few chapters, but it was \u201cabsolutely pompous\u201d, he admits now, away from his home in Bath to meet with his publishers in London.\n\nA decade later, he tried again. He kept the same characters, the same storyline, but \u201cstraight away it had this much more world-weary, humorous voice,\u201d he says. \u201cI was taking myself, and the fantasy genre, much less seriously.\u201d\n\nThe story began to work. Abercrombie spent months refining every paragraph, even \u201ctaking it seriously enough\u201d to show it to his parents, who are still his first readers and biggest critics. \u201cI can remember my mother saying \u2013 she denies this \u2013 \u2018This is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be\u2019. I knew then that I was on to something.\u201d\n\nThat something was 2006\u2019s The Blade Itself, following the adventures of torturer Inquisitor Glokta, barbarian warrior Logen Ninefingers, and the dashing but vain swordsman Jezal dan Luthar. Gritty, violent, cynical and redolent with dark humour, \u201cit was my take on Lord of the Rings, but bringing in all my weird preoccupations about how people work, the nature of violence. It\u2019s a reaction against the shiny and optimistic heroic fantasy I read as a teenager. In trying to do the opposite, it becomes quite pessimistic and grim.\u201d\n\nUnusually for epic fantasy, the story takes place at a time when money is becoming the new power and the middle classes are rising; mercantile forces are afoot. \u201cThe fantasy I read as a kid did often take place in this medieval sandbox where nothing really developed or changed, where conflict comes from a battle between an objective good and evil rather than rising out of social forces and changes as it does in the real world. So I\u2019ve always been interested in worlds that move on and shift,\u201d Abercrombie says.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t find an agent, sending out his manuscript to no avail. \u201cCriticism of that first book is hard to take. You\u2019re expecting to make an impact somehow, even if it\u2019s negative \u2013 \u2018I despise this book because it\u2019s so powerful!\u2019 \u2013 but what you get is the little photocopied slip saying \u2018thanks, but no thanks\u2019. So you have no idea if the book is unfashionable, weird, very bad, almost there \u2026 that total lack of any guidance was quite tough to deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the combination of violence and humour wasn\u2019t an immediate easy sell. People maybe read it and thought, \u2018is this Game of Thrones or Terry Pratchett?\u2019 Maybe there was a disconnect there.\u201d\n\nA friend in publishing passed the manuscript to Gollancz, and he was finally signed for a trilogy. Abercrombie continued his day job as a television editor, but he began cutting back as the royalties came in. \u201cThe first couple of cheques were little drips and then they started to get more and more significant, and I went from being shocked at how little writers earn to thinking, \u2018oh, you could make a living from this\u2019,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Sunday Times praised his \u201ctwisty plotting and gallows humour\u201d, the Guardian called him \u201cdelightfully twisted and evil\u201d and the Times found that \u201cthere is a gritty edge to his world and an awareness of the human cost of violence that is very contemporary\u201d. Two more books in the First Law trilogy followed, then three standalones set in the same world and a foray into writing for young adults. Today, Abercrombie is a leading voice in the \u201cgrimdark\u201d fantasy subgenre, a label he has embraced: he styles himself on Twitter as Lord Grimdark and dedicates his new book A Little Hatred to his wife Lou, \u201cwith grim, dark hugs\u201d.\n\nThis week, Abercrombie returns to the world of the First Law with A Little Hatred, the first in a new trilogy. Focusing on a new generation of characters \u2013 although bringing in some old favourites \u2013 it opens with a quote from Samuel Johnson: \u201cThe age is running mad after innovation; and all the business of the world is to be done in a new way.\u201d The chimneys of industry are rising over this fantasy universe, and its denizens are struggling to come out on top. It\u2019s funny and sardonic, violent and compelling \u2013 just what his readers have come to expect. It also features a notably larger cast of female characters than Abercrombie\u2019s usual fare, including Savine dan Glokta, a brilliantly mercenary socialite, and Rikke, who can see the future with her \u201clong eye\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe First Law was definitely very male,\u201d Abercrombie admits. \u201cA lot of classic fantasy tropes are male \u2013 boys with special destinies, wizardly mentors, shiny knights, that kind of thing \u2026 Even when I was writing the third, I was thinking, I didn\u2019t cover myself in glory here. I could have done a lot better, both in terms of the central female characters, but even incidentally having more women in the world. But I would never have considered it. If I needed a politician or a blacksmith or an innkeeper, those were all men.\u201d\n\nOver time, he says, he realised that \u201cthere are many ways to get women into any story if you think about it for 10 seconds\u201d. He hopes that having more women in the cast and the wider world will make it \u201cmore interesting\u201d.\n\nWith two more books still to come in the new trilogy, Abercrombie is busy enough for now. Next, he\u2019s interested in having magic collide with a more modern world. \u201cAlong with the cliche of worlds never really progressing, there\u2019s this cliche of magic leaking away from the world in this slightly tragic way, and a tear shed over all that\u2019s been lost,\u201d he says. \u201cI quite like the idea of magic erupting again in a violent and unpleasant way \u2013 that\u2019s another direction things might go.\u201d\n\n\u2022 A Little Hatred by Joe Abercrombie is published by Gollancz on 17 September.", "description": "The leading grimdark author, known for his cynical and violent fantasy novels, is back in the world of the First Law \u2013 along with a lot more women ...", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e57aeb04d3f09a7545f08797662293f4ad87e36/0_113_1557_934/master/1557.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8473020b2e36b8c8b359fa26fd33d1a8", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
