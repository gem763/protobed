But when asked about his succession plan, one thing, in particular, is clear to him.\n\n\u201cThe job is more suitable for a woman,\u201d Yanai told Bloomberg in an interview published August 4. \u201cThey are persevering, detailed oriented and have an aesthetic sense.\u201d\n\nUniqlo\u2019s success has made Yanai the richest person in Japan with a net worth of $24.8 billion, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe 70-year-old billionaire founded Uniqlo in 1984 and has grown its parent company, Fast Retailing, into the largest retailer in Asia, Business Insider previously reported. Uniqlo\u2019s focus on simple, causal styles that appeal to a diverse clientele has allowed it to rapidly expand across the globe. Uniqlo\u2019s stores outside of Japan now comprise the majority of the chain\u2019s sales, according to its website. The company made over $18.9 billion in revenue in 2018, Bloomberg reported.\n\nA commitment to diversifying the top ranks of Uniqlo.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Yanai has expressed his commitment to diversifying the top ranks of his company. In 2018, Uniqlo filled more than 30% of its management positions with women, according to Bloomberg. The Japanese retailer is now aiming to put women in more than half of its senior positions.\n\nYanai\u2019s efforts are especially rare in Japan, where only 4.1% of executive-level roles at publicly traded companies are filled by women, according to Japan\u2019s Gender Equality Bureau Cabinet Office.\n\nRead more: Forever 21 is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy \u2013 and the husband and wife duo who founded it have lost nearly $4 billion from their personal net worths since 2015\n\nMaki Akaida, the head of Fast Retailing\u2019s Japan unit is a \u201cpossibility\u201d for the CEO position, Yanai told Bloomberg. If selected, she could face substantial headwinds because of her gender. Female executives often face implicit gender bias, Business Insider previously reported. As a result, female CEOs are 45% more likely to be dismissed than male CEOs, a 2018 study by Vishal K. Gupta at the University of Alabama, Sandra C. Mortal at the University of Alabama, Sabatino Silveri at the University of Memphis, Minxing Sun at Clemson University, and Daniel B. Turban at the University of Missouri found.\n\nMany founders and CEOs prioritize their succession plans.\n\nHaving an eye on their succession plans is one strategy that has helped many successful founders and CEOs build strong foundations.\n\nHedge fund manager Ray Dalio allotted 10 years to find someone to succeed him as the co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater, he told Business Insider\u2018s Bradley Saacks and Richard Feloni in July.\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t done something three times before successfully, don\u2019t bet on your ability to do it,\u201d Dalio said.\n\nAnd at Facebook, succession planning extends beyond the C-Suite.\n\n\u201cWhen we do performance reviews with folks, a lot of the review is just based on what they do over the period of the performance review, but do you have a good successor, are all your key positions filled, do all your key people have successors?\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg told LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman on an episode of Hoffman\u2019s podcast \u201cMaster\u2019s of Scale,\u201d Business Insider previously reported. According to Zuckerberg, this ensures that the company won\u2019t lose any momentum when key players leave.", "description": "Business Insider - In 2018, Uniqlo filled 30% of its management positions with women, according to Bloomberg.
