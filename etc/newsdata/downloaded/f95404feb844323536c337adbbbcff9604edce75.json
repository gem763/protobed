European Central Bankers meanwhile get the chance to comment on another shock resignation by one of its German officials. And there's earnings due from Accenture (NYSE: ), Micron (NASDAQ: ) and Carnival (NYSE: ). Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 26th September.\n\n1. Fed to turn up the liquidity faucet\n\nThe Federal Reserve will offer bigger injections of cash to the financial system later to smooth over the volatility that has plagued short-term funding markets for the last two weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s raised the overnight funds on offer from $75 million to $100 million and has doubled the size of a similar two-week operation raised from $30 million to $60 million.\n\nChicago Fed President Charles Evans said Wednesday that a \u201cflat out larger balance sheet\u201d could be the answer to the problem of money-market volatility, but declined to be drawn on whether that would take the form of renewed outright purchases (quantitative easing) or new standing facilities that banks could use on an ad hoc basis.\n\n2. Peloton keeps the IPO market ticking over\n\nExercise bike-maker Peloton raised $1.16 billion in its IPO, selling 40 million shares at the top end of its marketing range of $26-$29. That gave it a valuation of $8.2 billion.\n\nThat comes as something of a relief to the equity capital markets after the unravelling of We Company\u2019s IPO in recent days, not to mention the poor performance of a number of this year\u2019s banner IPOs. Smiledirect has fallen 30% since listing two weeks ago while Slack has fallen 24% in the last month.\n\nEntertainment group Endeavor Group Holdings (NYSE: ) is due to price its IPO later, against a backdrop of reports it is considering a price below the bottom end of its marketing range.\n\n3. Stocks set to open a touch higher\n\nU.S. stock markets are set to open modestly higher, supported by comments late Wednesday from President Donald Trump that a trade deal with China was \u201cgetting closer\u201d.\n\nTrump, under pressure elsewhere from the start of an impeachment inquiry offered no further detail and his comments contrasted with the U.S. decision on Wednesday to penalize Chinese shipping companies for handling Iranian oil.\n\nBy 6 AM ET, were up 48 points or 0.2%, were also up 0.2%, while were up less than 0.1%\n\nThe day will feature earnings reports from consulting group , chipmaker and cruise operator . Tobacco stocks may be set for another rocky day as U.K.-based Imperial Brands (LON: ) fell over 9% after it cut its sales forecast due to the \u201cchallenging\u201d environment for vaping and other non-traditional tobacco products.\n\n4. Jaw-jaw from central banks\n\nIt\u2019s another busy day for appearances from central bankers, with , the man seen by many as the Federal Reserve\u2019s leading monetary thinker, arguably topping the bill at 11:45 AM ET. Dallas Fed chief , who yesterday predicted the U.S. will avoid a recession, is due to speak at 10:30, while European Central Bank president is set to speak at a separate event at the same time.\n\nDraghi and German central bank governor (due at 2 PM ET) will both be speaking less than a day after Sabine Lautenschlaeger resigned her post on the ECB\u2019s six-person board, a move that many linked to her dissatisfaction with Draghi\u2019s insistence on resuming quantitative easing at the ECB\u2019s meeting last week.\n\nOvernight, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda signalled likely action to ease policy at the BoJ's next policy meeting, citing growing risks of missing the bank's inflation target.\n\n5. Final GDP Reading, Kansas City Fed survey due\n\nThe final reading for U.S. growth in the second quarter is due at 8:30 AM, with an annualized print of 2.0% expected.
