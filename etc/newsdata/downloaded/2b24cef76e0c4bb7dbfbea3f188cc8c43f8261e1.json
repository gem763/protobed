He is expected to make a full recovery,' the spokesman said.\n\n'He is currently resting with his family by his side.

Shawn Porter is a rough and awkward fighter. I didn't get off what I wanted to. He's a true champion. He made it tough ... (but) all my punches have bad intentions.'\n\nPorter reacted to the news of the crash on Twitter last week: 'My dad always tells me 'this boxing thing is a part of your life but it's not going to last forever. U still have a lot of life to live after that.'\n\n'With that, I'm praying for @ErrolSpenceJr & his family because he has a lot of life to live and I pray he recovers quickly & fully.'\n\nSpence, a former Olympian, had been poised for a lucrative unification bout against undefeated WBO welterweight champion Terence Crawford, who is considered by many to be the world's top pound-for-pound boxer.\n\n'Praying for you champ @ErrolSpenceJr,' Crawford tweeted on Thursday.
