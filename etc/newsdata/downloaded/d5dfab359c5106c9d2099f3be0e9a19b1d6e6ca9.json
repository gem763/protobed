He was released following what allies said was strong popular pressure, but authorities said his case remains open.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s opposition said on Sunday a dialogue mediated by Norway to try to resolve the political crisis had ended, six weeks after President Nicolas Maduro suspended his country\u2019s participation.\n\nThe government responded on Monday by announcing a deal with smaller opposition parties to resolve the South American country\u2019s deep political divide by reforming the National Electoral Commission, accused of bias in favor of the ruling socialists.\n\nThat deal was not backed by allies of opposition leader Juan Guaido.\n\nMaduro did not inform Norway\u2019s foreign ministry, which was mediating a dialogue between his government and Guaido, about a side deal with a smaller sector of the opposition before it was announced earlier this week, a member of Guaido\u2019s negotiating team said on Wednesday.", "description": "Mexico and Uruguay said on Thursday that negotiations were the only acceptable way to achieve a peaceful solution to the deepening political and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, as they welcomed the release from jail of a top opposition figure.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
