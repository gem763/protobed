I put it all out there.\"\n\nClaye won silver with a jump of 17.74 meters.\n\nIt was the fourth time the pair, who both competed for the University of Florida, held the top two spots at major championships.\n\n\"I think we really appreciate having each other,\" Taylor said of Claye. \"If we didn't have each other in training, maybe we wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nHughes Fabrice Zango of Burkina Faso clinched bronze with a jump of 17.66m.", "description": "Athletics: Taylor claims fourth triple jump world title after shaky start", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8S0VV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
