Because I\u2019ve had run-ins with Rebekah before over similar things, so I wasn\u2019t as shocked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Obviously like everybody else you read it and you think, \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d but I wasn\u2019t as shocked seeing who it actually allegedly was.\u2019\n\nAsked whether she believes Rebekah is responsible, Danielle replied: \u2018It\u2019s definitely come from Becky\u2019s account so who was it?\n\n\u2018I think she did it. Sadly I really do. I think it\u2019s a shame because she probably never thought she was going to get caught out.\u2019\n\nLizzie Cundy and Danielle Lloyd on This Morning (Picture: ITV)\n\nAsked for what reasons, Danielle said: \u2018It\u2019s obviously not the money, I think it\u2019s the press issue. I think she thought maybe if she was feeding the press stories, she would maybe get more headlines for herself. I honestly don\u2019t know.\n\n\u2018I could never do that to somebody.\u2019\n\nLizzie believes Coleen must have evidence to believe she\u2019s responsible to out her in such a public way, adding: \u2018It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guilty just because you have friends who are journalists. I do a radio show with one but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing that.\n\n\u2018I think Coleen had to find the truth and I don\u2019t think she would have gone to the measures of going and outing her unless she had concrete evidence.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter making the claims live on air, Rebekah has since denied Danielle\u2019s accusations they had \u2018similar run-ins\u2019 with a particularly scathing tweet.\n\n\u2018\u2018Danielle Lloyd making false claims on @thismorning that we have had \u201csimilar run-ins\u201d is utter boll**ks,\u2019 Rebekah wrote.\n\n\u2018She is just fuming that I \u201cdidn\u2019t get Jamie recruiting\u201d for her like she asked me to\u2026\u2019\n\nDanielle previously posted numerous rat emojis as the news broke in response to the post.\n\nRebekah is currently pregnant with her fifth child, her second with footballer husband Jamie.\n\nShe grew close to Coleen when their husbands played alongside each other for England.\n\nYou can catch This Morning weekdays on ITV at 10.30am.\n\nMORE: Rebekah Vardy could sue Coleen Rooney if forensic investigation proves she didn\u2019t leak stories\n\nMORE: Susanna Reid calls out Coleen Rooney for shaming Rebekah Vardy on Instagram: \u2018I would have called first\u2019", "description": "Danielle Lloyd has aired her thoughts on the drama between Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney live on This Morning.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/danielle-lloyd-new-2-a9ec_1570715491.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
