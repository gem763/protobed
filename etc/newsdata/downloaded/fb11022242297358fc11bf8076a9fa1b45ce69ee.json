That's the case for Week 6 of the college football season. With six teams in the Top 25 taking the weekend off and three matchups featuring ranked opponents, there's only 16 games to pick this week. But don't despair. The aforementioned three ranked matchups all have compelling story lines.\n\nThe highlight is an SEC unbeaten showdown between No. 7 Auburn and No. 8 Florida in the Swamp. The Tigers have been tested twice already away from home with wins against Oregon and Texas A&M. The Gators have been up and down, but appear to be more settled with backup quarterback Kyle Trask at the controls.\n\nTwo Big Ten matchups also are on the offer.\n\nNo. 5 Ohio State gets its first real test of the season when No. 23 Michigan State visits. Justin Fields and the Buckeyes offense has been running through everyone in the first five weeks. But the Spartans are one of the top defenses in the country and should provide some legitimate resistance, especially if their offense can get in gear.\n\nNo. 14 Iowa travels to No. 18 Michigan in a game that jim Harbaugh and the Wolverines need to calm things down in Ann Arbor. A second conference loss this early likely ends any chance of getting to the Big Ten title game. For the visiting Hawkeyes, they just keep quietly going about their business and winning games. QB Nate Stanley likely will be the key as they aim to keep pace with Wisconsin in West division.", "description": "There's only 16 games featuring Top 25 teams in Week 6 of the college football season.
