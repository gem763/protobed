Photo: Columbia Pictures\n\nBack in 1995, during the nascent days of the internet, Sandra Bullock starred in the cyber-mystery thriller The Net. In the film, the world of online is a place where you can both order pizza with a few button clicks and succumb to vengeful hackers hellbent on destroying your life. Nearly 25 years later, with our Domino\u2019s Pizza Trackers and semi-regular data breaches, reality isn\u2019t much different.\n\nAnother thing that hasn\u2019t changed? Comedy legend Carl Reiner\u2019s fervent love of the film and its leading lady. Reiner is known for his 70-plus-year career, which includes creating The Dick Van Dyke Show, directing movies like Oh, God! and The Jerk, acting in the Ocean\u2019s Eleven trilogy, and maintaining a comedy partnership and friendship with Mel Brooks, among many other accomplishments. But another thing for which he\u2019s drawn attention lately \u2014 at least, among his loyal Twitter followers \u2014 is regularly tweeting about The Net.\n\nOn Netflix saw THE NET starring Sandra Bullock & enjoyed it as much as I did 20 yrs ago. Scary warning on possible abuses on the cyber net \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) October 18, 2015\n\nIf you have or haven't seen Sandra Bullock in \"The Net,\" I suggest you do. It's so well written and performed, You'll thank me. \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) June 30, 2016\n\njRe-watched \"The Net,\" 1 of my favorite 'comeuppemce' films starring Sandra Bullock,1 of my all-time favorite actors. Recommend u see it! \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) February 20, 2017\n\njust watched and enjoyed for the umpteenth time one of the best Comeuppance films of all time. \"The Net\" starring one of my favorite actresses Sandra Bullock \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) November 25, 2018\n\nEvery time I watch Sandra Bullock in \"The Net\" I am happily .rewarded \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) January 23, 2019\n\nIf you want to see a most satisfying film starring one of my all time favorite actresses, watch, or re-watch, \"The Net,\" starring Sandra Bullock, \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) September 4, 2019\n\nIn The Net, Bullock plays systems analyst Angela Bennett, a shut-in whose entire life is digitally erased by hackers after she stumbles upon a partnership between cyberterrorists and the film\u2019s version of Norton Antivirus. Combining tropes from Golden Era Hollywood (Bullock is seduced and then stalked by an homme fatale) and early internet culture (chat rooms, robotic text-to-speech, and LOTS of close-ups of Bullock furiously hacking), The Net serves as a great counterpart to Hackers, the other 1995 film about digital identity manipulation. Whereas that film is now ironically lauded as a cult classic, The Net has endured as more of a straight foretelling of the many privacy issues that continue to plague humanity.\n\nOn a whim, I reached out to see if Carl Reiner would like to chat about The Net. And reader, he did. Joining him in this conversation about the utter gift that is Sandra Bullock, the technology of Pizza.net and mainframes, and why young comedians can and should make mistakes, was Lawrence O\u2019Flahavan, his publisher at Random Content publishing, who just happened to be with him at the time of our phone call.\n\nThank you so much for doing this interview.\n\nIt\u2019s my pleasure. I really adore that girl [Sandra Bullock].\n\nI\u2019ve noticed over the years that you really love this movie.\n\nI must\u2019ve seen The Net three or four times and it\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the great comeuppance movies ever made. I put it in a class with The Count of Monte Cristo. There\u2019s a few movies like that where the comeuppance of the villain at the end \u2026 her performance is so winning and you get into her mind. You know, just her sitting at that little computer, the close-ups of her face thinking and of her writing \u2014 her thoughts are so clear and so fascinating. I\u2019m always amazed at her talent and beauty. And of course, she did other things too. Miss Congeniality. But there was another movie she made that was very good. I can\u2019t remember the name now.\n\nMaybe Speed? The one where she and Keanu Reeves are on a bus?\n\nYeah. She\u2019s a force of nature. Oh, The Proposal! That\u2019s the other one.\n\nAnother movie that is a pleasure to re-visit is \"The Proposal, starring Sandra Bullock, one of my all time favorite actors, \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) September 23, 2019\n\nWhen The Net was released in 1995, that was around the time the internet first entered mainstream American culture. I\u2019m curious, were you yourself around online in 1995?\n\nI don\u2019t think so.\n\nDo you remember when you first went online? Did a friend or a grandchild show you?\n\nWell, I have a guy here, Lawrence O\u2019Flahavan. He\u2019s my publisher. And he\u2019s responsible for anything I put on the internet.\n\nLawrence O\u2019Flahavan: What we did was, he wanted to write a book, I Remember Me. And I thought, \u201cMan, the best way for us to market this is to get Carl to tweet.\u201d And Carl said, \u201cWhat\u2019s tweet? What are you talking about?\u201d And I said, \u201cCarl, it\u2019s like having an audience. You walk onto a stage and talk into a microphone. And we broadcast.\u201d And that\u2019s how we began his whole online presence. He had his email, he had his basic things, but his social-media presence was not active.\n\nDid The Net in some way scare you off from using the internet? Because as a child, The Net made me scared of going online \u2014 that it was going to erase all my information.\n\nReiner: No, not at all. It made me a big fan of Sandra Bullock! No, every time she puts her face on screen, you know you\u2019re gonna see something good.\n\nI know that you filmed a scene with Sandra Bullock for Ocean\u2019s Eight that was unfortunately cut. I\u2019m curious, was your character originally in the script or did you pull some strings so you could reprise your Ocean\u2019s Eleven character with Sandra for a day?\n\nO\u2019Flahavan: It was in the original script. Carl was excited to meet Sandra.\n\nReiner: I told her, I said, \u201cYou know, you did a couple little moments that are unforgettable.\u201d When she\u2019s in The Proposal, that\u2019s one of them, where she\u2019s faking the fact that she\u2019s engaged to someone rather than getting thrown out of the country because she wasn\u2019t a citizen. The attitude she did and the way she touched her boyfriend was so funny! Tried to look lovey-dovey. It was one of the really funny moments.\n\nPhoto: Walt Disney Studios\n\nAction, comedy, romance, thrillers like The Net. She can do it all.\n\nOh yeah. She can do it all. There\u2019s no question about it. What was her other one? Two Weeks Notice? That was a goodie. She\u2019s never done anything that didn\u2019t work. Even the bus thing she did.\n\nO\u2019Flahavan: What was it like meeting her for the first time on the set [of Ocean\u2019s Eight]?\n\nReiner: I was so thrilled that I got to meet her because I wanted to tell her how I felt about her work.\n\nVery excited about tomorrow when I'll be doing a cameo in Sandra Bullock's new film,\"Oceans Six,\" Love that lady and love her films. \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) March 5, 2017\n\nO\u2019Flahavan: And what did she do when she saw you?\n\nReiner: I don\u2019t remember.\n\nO\u2019Flahavan: She knelt down, remember?\n\nReiner: Oh yes! That\u2019s right. And I knelt down to her! Oh, I couldn\u2019t believe that. I didn\u2019t even know she knew me.\n\nO\u2019Flahavan: We wish we could see what that scene looked like. We\u2019ve never been able to get a copy of it, of Carl and Sandra. We would love to be able to see that. Put that in the article, by the way!\n\nI\u2019ll make sure some of the higher-ups at Warner Bros know that Mr. Reiner needs that scene.\n\nReiner: I also love the fact that she adopted a child, a young African-American child, and is a loving, doting mother. By the way, is she married?\n\nShe was in a high-profile relationship some years back, but they got divorced. I\u2019m not sure what her current status is.\n\nI just wondered if that little boy has a father, but she\u2019s certainly doing a great job with him, I understand.\n\nDennis Miller has a brief but memorable role in The Net. These days he\u2019s arguably more famous as a conservative commentator than as a comedian. As an ardent Democrat yourself, what do you make of comedians who defend the policies of the Republican Party in their routine?\n\nO\u2019Flahavan: Carl\u2019s waving his hands as if he\u2019s waving a gnat from his face.\n\nMy favorite movie genre is the come up pence film, such as the 'Count of Monte Christo\" starring Robert Donat and a close second is \"Taken\" which stars Liam Neeson, which I just watched. If you haven't seen it, see it and you'll be glad you did! \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) August 19, 2019\n\nWho are your favorite and/or funniest people to follow on Twitter?\n\nReiner: Judd Apatow, Sarah Silverman, Amy Schumer. Mel Brooks when he tweets. Rob Reiner, of course. Trump because anything that guy says makes me laugh because it\u2019s just so nuts. He\u2019s not a comedian but it\u2019s just nuts.\n\nNothing like spending two hours having your dentist drilling in your mouth to take your mind off the sad fact that we have a incompetent in the White House denigrating our democracy. \u2014 carl reiner (@carlreiner) July 30, 2019\n\nIn The Net, Sandra Bullock\u2019s life is destroyed when her identity is erased off the internet. But these days, people can have their lives destroyed if something they said is amplified on the internet. For example, a young comedian who tweeted a racy joke in the past will get fired from a job ten years later when that tweet is unearthed. My question is: Are you glad the internet wasn\u2019t around to capture any mistakes you might\u2019ve made as a young comedian?\n\nAll my life, I felt like mistakes were gifts of gold. And I feel like because the audience is present, it\u2019s okay to make those mistakes, because it makes the experience even richer. Once onstage, I had to recite a speech as Claudius and was told to memorize it overnight. I got halfway through and couldn\u2019t remember the other half of it. So I just started making up Elizabethan double-talk, which I used later on Your Show of Shows. Anyway, the audience responded so well that after I had it memorized the next night, I didn\u2019t get any applause.\n\nCarl Reiner. Photo: Tibrina Hobson/Getty Images\n\nSo in terms of mistakes, it\u2019s okay to make mistakes. And it\u2019s okay to let the audience in on it. When you make a mistake, let them participate. It\u2019s important for a comedian to make mistakes because it\u2019s not real. It\u2019s always practice. Hey, I gotta go!\n\nThank you so much for your time, Mr. Reiner.\n\nOne thing I know: Anything I say about Sandra Bullock is always checked off and doubled. She\u2019s beloved by practically everyone who\u2019s ever seen her.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read a bad thing about her.\n\nAnything I said positive about her, you can put three stars next to it because there\u2019s no negatives about her! There\u2019s nothing negative about her.", "description": "The comedian Carl Reiner has been tweeting about the movie since 2015. He finally agreed to explain his obsession.
