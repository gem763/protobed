ESPN is considering making changes in the broadcast booth next season, according to Andrew Marchand of the New York Post.\n\nRodriguez isn\u2019t part of those changes. He\u2019s considered \u201csafe.\u201d While there\u2019s some uncertainty regarding Jessica Mendoza and Matt Vasgersian, the Post believes the two have a \u201c70% chance of returning.\u201d The network is considering changes even though \u201cSunday Night Baseball\u201d saw a ratings boost in 2019.\n\nESPN still wants to utilize Mendoza, and will only move her off the broadcast if they can find another significant role for her to fill. Mendoza\u2019s status as a New York Mets advisor put her in a difficult spot as a broadcaster in 2019. She was also not allowed in the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 clubhouse due to her affiliation with another team. The Dodgers did the same thing with David Ross, who is both a broadcaster for ESPN and an adviser to the Chicago Cubs.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIf Vasgersian is out on play-by-play, ESPN will consider Dave Fleming, Karl Ravech and Boog Sciambi as possible replacements, according to Marchand. Sciambi and Rodriguez worked one game together in 2019.\n\nChanges aren\u2019t guaranteed. And if the Post\u2019s odds are correct, there\u2019s a good chance the same booth returns in 2020. For now, though, expect more A-Rod \u2014 and probably some J-LO \u2014 when \u201cSunday Night Baseball\u201d returns.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
