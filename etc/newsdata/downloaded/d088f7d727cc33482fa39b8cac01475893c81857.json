FOREX-Dollar nurses losses; pound's fate tied to EU summit\n\n* Dollar supported after overnight losses\n\n* Pound on edge ahead of EU summit in Brussels\n\n* Risk appetite cautious in absence of Sino-U.S. deal\n\ndetails\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nHONG KONG, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The dollar found support on\n\nThursday having weakened on lacklustre U.S. retail data, while\n\nthe volatile pound was on edge as Britain and the European Union\n\nscrambled to secure a last-minute Brexit deal.\n\nSterling swung about a five-month high overnight,\n\nknocked around by a series of mixed headlines on the likelihood\n\nof progress at an EU leaders summit in Brussels later on\n\nThursday. It has surged some 5% since last week as negotiations\n\nstepped up, and sat in early Asian hours at $1.2816 per pound.\n\nThe dollar was steady against most major currencies.\n\n\"I think we're all grateful that we might be coming to some\n\nsort of an end to the recent saga,\" said Nick Twidale, director\n\nof Sydney-based trade finance provider Xchainge.\n\n\"Anything that isn't a hard Brexit is going to be positive\n\nfor the sterling,\" he said, adding a deal or something close to\n\none could push the pound to $1.3500 or above.\n\nFailure could drop it below $1.2200, Commonwealth Bank of\n\nAustralia analyst Richard Grace said in a note.\n\nAgainst the euro EURGBP= the pound also stood just under a\n\nfive-month high at 0.8638 per euro.\n\nThe U.S. dollar had dropped on Wednesday as U.S. retail\n\nsales fell for the first time in seven months, painting a gloomy\n\npicture of the economy and making a case for rate cuts.\n\nIt was a touch weaker against the euro at $1.1074 and\n\nthe Japanese yen at 108.69, but slightly stronger against\n\nthe Australian and New Zealand dollars. Against a basket of\n\ncurrencies the dollar hit a month low of 97.898 overnight\n\nand was steady around that level on Thursday.\n\nThe Aussie AUD=D3 weakened a fraction to $0.6755 after a\n\nsenior Reserve Bank of Australia official said a national\n\nproperty downturn had proven a larger-than-expected drag on the\n\neconomy. However traders are focused on employment data due at 0030\n\nGMT for the next read on the health of the labour market and the\n\nlikely outlook for monetary policy.\n\n\"If the unemployment rate rises sooner than we expect ...\n\nthis increases the risk that the RBA cuts the cash rate in\n\nNovember,\" said National Australia Bank's head of FX strategy,\n\nRay Attril, who anticipates unemployment keeping steady.\n\nLingering worries about trade tensions between the United\n\nStates and China have also kept investors' risk appetite in\n\ncheck, weighing on the Aussie and other trade-exposed\n\ncurrencies.\n\nReports of a partial trade deal between the world's two\n\nlargest economies last week initially cheered markets, but a\n\nlack of details on the agreement has since curbed enthusiasm.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 drifted lower, following\n\ndovish comments from a top central banker on Wednesday, and sits\n\nat $0.6290, not far from a four-year low hit two weeks ago.\n\nChina's yuan, which fell on Wednesday as new U.S.\n\nlegislation backing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong\n\nthreatened to widen the rift between Beijing and Washington,\n\nweakened a little further.\n\nIn offshore trade CNH= the yuan eased marginally to 7.1004\n\nper dollar.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Dollar nurses losses; pound's fate tied to EU summit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6115O_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
