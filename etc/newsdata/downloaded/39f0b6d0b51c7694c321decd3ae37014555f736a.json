Join the conversation below.\n\nSOFR\u2019s price is based on repo rates, so the spike in that market last Tuesday caused the new benchmark for variable-rate securities to jump almost 3 percentage points to its highest level on record. It fell back to 1.86% on Friday.\n\nThe move was closely watched because a group of bankers, investors and regulators overseen by the New York Fed has designated SOFR as the preferred replacement for the longtime variable-rate benchmark known as Libor. That rate, which underpins trillions of dollars of loans including home mortgages and corporate loans, fell out of favor after a manipulation scandal.\n\nLibor is slated for replacement in 2021 and finding a substitute is a key challenge for banks, companies and investors. Each wants a reference rate that reflects the risks from short-term lending and is supported by a liquid market that behaves in a predictable manner. Properly setting the rates on business and consumer loans can determine whether such loans are affordable for borrowers and profitable for lenders.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York has designated the secured overnight financing rate, known as SOFR, as the preferred replacement for Libor.

The rise of repo rates well above the Fed\u2019s target for overnight rates for loans between banks is a sign that \u201cthe Fed lost control of funding markets,\u201d he said.\n\nThe increased volatility also raised concerns about whether the transition from Libor can be completed on schedule.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very problematic,\u201d said John Spaid, executive vice president for finance at National Health Investors, a real-estate investment trust that focuses on assisted living facilities and hospitals.\n\nParticipants in the working group of banks, investors and regulators convened by the New York Fed to manage the transition away from Libor\u2014known as the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, or ARRC\u2014said the one-day spike in SOFR, while unusual, would barely register for users of the rate. SOFR is usually averaged out over 90 days when used in transactions, which smooths out short-term volatility.\n\nUsing the 90 day-average, SOFR moved only 0.02 percentage point after accounting for Tuesday\u2019s jump, said Brian Grabenstein, who leads the Libor transition efforts for ARRC member bank Wells Fargo . The three-month Libor rate, meanwhile, rose 0.04 percentage point.\n\nAlthough that limited the impact of Tuesday\u2019s spike, the fact that SOFR swung so widely could give some borrowers and lenders pause as they prepare to use it, said Anne Beaumont, a lawyer who represents investment and asset management firms at New York-based Friedman Kaplan Seiler & Adelman LLP.\n\n\u201cIt certainly raises the question in people\u2019s minds as to whether the rate could be unstable, not for market reasons, but for other reasons, and that is troubling,\u201d she said.\n\nOthers said that the wobbles last week in the repo market don\u2019t diminish the likelihood that SOFR becomes the U.S.\u2019s chosen alternative to Libor.\n\n\u201cThe ARRC was aware that repo is volatile\u201d when it tapped SOFR as its preferred replacement, said Eric Donovan, who trades interest-rate derivatives at INTL FCStone .\n\nKristi Leo, president of the Structured Finance Association, said investors represented by the trade group are showing a \u201cmodest\u201d level of concern about SOFR\u2019s volatility. Many expected rates to jump at quarter ends, when demands on cash are high, but the recent outsize moves in repo rates are unusual, and investors are \u201cstill evaluating\u201d the new benchmark.\n\n\u201cThey have not found a better solution,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com and Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com", "description": "An interest rate proposed to replace Libor as a new benchmark spiked last week amid tumult in money markets.", "authors": ["Daniel Kruger", "Vipal Monga", "Daniel.Kruger Wsj.Com", "Vipal.Monga Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109860/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
