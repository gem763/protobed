Atlanta HERO (Highway Emergency Response Operators) units helped Trivium employees clean up the mess, using brooms and shovels to salvage what they could.\n\nWhile losing a substantial amount of pricey dice isn\u2019t great, Trivium\u2019s representative says the company, which plans to unveil the game associated with all of these dice closer to its planned early 2020 launch, maintains a positive attitude. \u201cThough unfortunate it happened, nobody got hurt and we now own an unofficial world record for the largest dice roll in history!\u201d\n\nConsidering the average roll of two six-sided dice is around seven, and approximately 216,000 dice were rolled, Trivium estimates the roll totaled 756,000. The truck was undamaged, having made its saving throw.", "description": "On Friday, September 13 in the U.S., a truck bound for the Georgia-based tabletop and video game company Trivium Studios took a turn too sharply, spilling 216,000 gaming dice onto Interstate 75 in Atlanta in what could be the biggest unintentional dice roll ever....", "authors": ["Cecilia D'Anastasio", "Keza Macdonald"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/q2vzoc4oaltl5nnbqmgs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
