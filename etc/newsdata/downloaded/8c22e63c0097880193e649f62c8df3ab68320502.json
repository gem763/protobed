After years of tweaking and adding, the city\u2019s legal system has some real oddities \u2013 here are just a few.\n\nOffences by carriers of nightsoil and pigwash\n\nThe words \u201cnightsoil\u201d and \u201cpigwash\u201d are just old-fashioned ways of saying human waste and food scraps. The law states that there are right and wrong ways of dealing with this waste. For example, pigwash must be taken to a licensed pigsty. The fine for failing to do so? HK$100.\n\nMake sure you're disposing of your pigwash properly, or you could face a fine. Photo: SCMP / K.Y. Cheng\n\nWhere to find the best char siu bao in Hong Kong\n\nPenalty for using the tramway with flange-wheeled carriages, etc.\n\nIt seems obvious: Hong Kong\u2019s tramway rails should only be used by trams. But apparently some people needed clarification. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a rule stating that running your own trolleys or wagons on the rail is illegal, with a HK$100 fine for anyone who tries. If nothing else, it\u2019s extremely dangerous.\n\nObviously, nothing but trams should go on tramways, but you're facing a HK$100 if you use it with a different vehicle.

The police may even asks parents for their child\u2019s details when they sign them up to classes. According to the government, these rules are in place because fights have broken out in the past between rival dance troupes, and many of those involved already had criminal records. Whatever the reason, if you break this law, it\u2019s a HK$2,000 fine and up to six months in prison.\n\nSmartphone use is leading to neck problems for teenagers: here's how to fix it\n\nFiring near a dwelling house or road\n\nGenerally speaking, owning a gun is Hong Kong is illegal, but if you were to fire your gun (or cannon) within 200 metres of someone else\u2019s home, you could be fined HK$500. But only if you do it after being warned not to. So doing it once is fine.\n\nYou can only fire your cannon once before worrying about fines.

You can get a hunting license from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, but they are extremely uncommon. The government also recently got rid of the pig-hunting team it had approved to control the city\u2019s wild boar population, instead replacing it with the Trap, Neuter, Release programme in 2017. If you somehow do manage to get a licence to hunt, be careful not to disturb other peoples' crops. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to pay for whatever damage you, or your hunting dogs (assuming you have them, too), have done.\n\nIf you get a license to hunt, be sure not to damage anyone's crops.

Being drunk in public or at a bar comes with a HK$50 fine. Being drunk and behaving \u201cin a riotous or disorderly manner\u201d can land you a HK$250 fine and a possible two-month jail sentence. So can being drunk while riding a non-motor vehicle, such as a bicycle (or a horse).\n\nEven being drunk in a bar could technically get you a fine.

So if you are planning to let your racehorse wander around the city centre, think again. You could face a HK$500 fine and three months in prison.\n\nPlease don't let your racehorse loose in the city centre. We're sick of warning you about this.
