He was jailed for seven years\n\nHe had five crates of artwork worth $11 million delivered from an art dealer to the home's garage in 2014 but refused to pay.\n\nThe home is a 'fixer-upper,' says Sotheby's agent Anne Herrera says. As a result, there are no pictures of the home's interior.\n\nAll the floors need to be replaced and there are also a number of leaks in the home.\n\n'This property is for someone who has the money to begin with to buy the property and then either wants to do minimal work to it and kind of clean it up and keep the same floor plan or really completely gut it,' Herrera said to Insider.\n\n'This property awaits your vision and creativity. Bring your contractors and architects to re-imagine the iconic view home of your dreams,' the listing states.\n\nA winding pathway leads to a secluded seaside cove down a zig-zag pink staircase that is carved into the cliffside\n\nThe home has stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco Bay and Baker Beach, seen right\n\nThe home is a true a fixer-upper according to Sotheby's realtor Anne Herrera. The home needs new floors and there are leaks\n\nBuilt in 1925, the property includes seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, formal living and dining rooms, a wine cellar, a top-floor family room, two fireplaces and pathway leading to a secluded cove where dolphins are often seen gliding in the waves.\n\nDespite situated somewhat precariously on the cliff edge, the home is not dangerous. The previous owners purchased the house in 1990 and lived in the property until quite recently.\n\nThe home's location alone should help the sale with unobstructed views of the famous Golden Gate Bridge , the Marin Headlands, Baker Beach and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSea Cliff is a quiet and peaceful neighborhood with an emphasis on the outdoors and the stunning views of the surrounding bay.\n\nThe home sits right above a secluded and private cove which no other homeowners are able to access\n\nFrom the main road at 224 Sea Cliff Avenue, it isn't possible to tell what lies beneath and the mansion looks to be ordinary\n\nThe home occupies a unique piece of real estate with only 18-25 homes sitting on the strip of clifftop land\n\nThe home is one of a limited number of high-end houses that have been built into the cliffside in the Sea Cliff neighborhood\n\nFor those wanting to be a little closer to the beach, the mansion has a zig-zag staircase that is carved into the cliff side leading down to a small private beach. The staircase is a unique feature of the home. Most of the other residents are stuck up top.\n\nThere are roughly 18 to 25 high-end properties built along the clifftop so whoever finally gets the keys would be owning a special piece of San Francisco real estate.\n\n'There aren't many that actually come on the market,' Herrera said. 'There was one that sold very quickly in July for $18 million.'\n\n'It has become a place for those that have the means to do so to buy a house and still be in the city, but still be very connected to nature and all the beauty of the views of the bridge and the beach,' Herrera notes.\n\nSome of the neighborhood's famous current and past residents include Robin Williams, Sharon Stone, Eugene Levy, Cheech Marin, Ansel Adams, Jefferson Airplane's Paul Kantner and Metallica's Kirk Hammett.", "description": "A San Francisco waterfront mansion once used to store millions of stolen art works is back on the market.
