(John Bazemore/AP)\n\nBy the time the St. Louis Cardinals took the field for the bottom of the first inning Wednesday, the only drama remaining in the decisive Game 5 of the National League Division Series was whether their scheduled starting pitcher, ace right-hander Jack Flaherty, would join them at the center of the diamond.\n\nClearly, whether to pull Flaherty before he threw a single pitch was not a decision the Cardinals had game-planned in advance. But they also could not have imagined that by that point, Flaherty would have already batted, drawn a walk and scored a run \u2014 the ninth of the 10 runs the Cardinals would score against the Atlanta Braves in a stunning, dizzying, this-can\u2019t-be-happening explosion in the top of the first at Atlanta\u2019s SunTrust Park.\n\nSo, seriously: After being gifted the biggest first-inning cushion in the history of baseball\u2019s postseason, why not go ahead and yank Flaherty on the spot, saving him for Game 1 of the NL Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers/Washington Nationals winner on Friday?\n\nSure, it would have been an unconventional move. But as we have seen at length this month, with bold move after bold move in the ever-evolving deployment of pitching in the postseason, these are unconventional times.\n\nAnd the circumstances of Wednesday\u2019s first inning \u2014 well, they were nothing if not unconventional.\n\n[Nationals-Dodgers: Live updates from Game 5 in Los Angeles]\n\nBy the time the Cardinals\u2019 half of the first was over, 26 minutes after it had begun, they had sent 14 batters to the plate, laced five hits (all of them with runners in scoring position), sent Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz to the showers having retired only one batter and plated a staggering 10 runs \u2014 the most first-inning runs by any team in postseason history. And somehow, in the Year of the Homer, the Cardinals\u2019 10-spot came without benefit of a single round-tripper.\n\nFrom there, it was only a matter of how lopsided the final score would be, and it turned out to be 13-1. The NL Central champion Cardinals are thus back in the NLCS for the first time since 2014, when they lost in five games to the San Francisco Giants, while the Braves, champions of the NL East, saw their season end in the Division Series for the second straight season and the eighth time since they last won a postseason series in 2001.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of the Cardinals\u2019 10-run first inning was the fact it began with them playing for one run \u2014 a tacit show of confidence in Flaherty\u2019s ability to shut down the Braves. After leadoff man Dexter Fowler drew a walk off Foltynewicz, Cardinals Manager Mike Shildt called for a sacrifice bunt \u2014 an old-school move nearing extinction in the era of analytics and home run supremacy.\n\nAs the next nine Cardinals batters circled the bases against Foltynewicz and emergency reliever Max Fried, the only out the Braves had recorded was that one the Cardinals had gifted them.\n\nAs exhilarating and cathartic as the inning was for the Cardinals, it was just as deflating and humiliating for the Braves. They walked four batters in the inning, including the pitcher. Gold Glove-winning first baseman Freddie Freeman made an error. And in perhaps the ugliest moment of an ugly inning, catcher Brian McCann allowed a third strike to get away from him, then slipped trying to recover and fell on his rear end \u2014 allowing Marcell Ozuna to reach first base and extend the inning, with the Cardinals\u2019 10th run crossing the plate.\n\n[Braves shelve foam tomahawks \u2018out of respect\u2019 for Cardinals pitcher]\n\nThe benefit to the Cardinals of pulling Flaherty on the spot was obvious: It could have saved him for Game 1 of the NLCS, thus giving them the upper hand in that series against either the Dodgers or Nationals, who had to use their best pitchers just to survive and advance.\n\nThe drawbacks were subtler and not as clear-cut. For beginners, Flaherty had already gone through his full pre-start warmup, with its meticulous program of stretching and loosening, plus an extensive bullpen session. Because this is not a scenario often encountered, we can assume no one knows exactly what sort of toll that warmup alone, and the subsequent cool-down, would have placed on Flaherty\u2019s arm. Would it be safe for him to do it again in two days?\n\nAlso, the Braves, though understandably demoralized at that moment, did score the third-most runs in the NL this season \u2014 including 19 different games in which they scored at least 10 \u2014 and the Cardinals, despite having one of the best bullpens in the league, clearly wanted to take no chances. Pulling Flaherty would have required an extensive and taxing deployment of relievers for nine full innings \u2014 although the Cardinals would have had the option of adding a couple of fresher arms for the NLCS.\n\nBut more than that, Flaherty is a mere 23 years old \u2014 not an age when teams typically take chances with their aces\u2019 health. Whether he started Game 1, Game 2 or Game 3, he was likely to pitch only twice in the NLCS \u2014 because no matter which game he got, any more than that would require his pitching on short rest. Saving Flaherty for Game 3 \u2014 which he will pitch on full rest \u2014 means that, as long as the Cardinals stay on rotation, he would also get the ball in a potential Game 7, also on full rest.\n\nAnd so the Cardinals went ahead and sent Flaherty out there. It wasn\u2019t the wrong move.\n\nFew things are guaranteed in baseball these days, with the home run explosion being what it is, and few leads are truly safe \u2014 but Jack Flaherty with a 10-run lead is a pretty good bet. So maybe the Cardinals would let him pitch a couple of low-stress innings, pat him on the back and let him get an early start on the champagne that was sitting on ice in their clubhouse?\n\nNot quite. Flaherty pitched the first. He pitched the second, now with an 11-0 lead. He pitched the third, up 13-0. In the fifth, he loaded the bases with two outs \u2014 drilling Braves superstar Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. with a fastball in the back and touching off a tense staredown \u2014 before getting Freeman to ground into a forceout to end the inning.\n\nSurely, that would spell the end of Flaherty\u2019s night, with his pitch count sitting at 94? Um, no. After a brief discussion in the Cardinals\u2019 dugout, Flaherty was allowed to hit for himself \u2014 inviting retaliation for the Acu\u00f1a plunking, which, thankfully, the Braves passed on \u2014 and pitch the sixth.\n\nIn the end, given the unexpected gift of a blowout win that afforded them the luxury of looking ahead to the NLCS a few hours early, the Cardinals chose saving their bullpen over saving Flaherty. The logic was sound, as far as it went. But when Flaherty was finally lifted after the sixth, he had thrown 104 pitches \u2014 slightly more than his season average of 96.3 per start.\n\nEven if the Cardinals didn\u2019t need to save Flaherty for Game 1 of the NLCS, did they really need to empty his tank in what was, by the end, a 12-run game? Perhaps the answer will come the next time he\u2019s on a mound, five days down the road.", "description": "St. Louis decided to stick with ace Jack Flaherty rather than try to save him for the NLCS.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer", "October At Pm", "Dave Sheinin Has Been A Washington Post Sports Writer Since Before Working At The Post", "He Covered Golf", "Florida Gators Football", "Major League Baseball For The Miami Herald."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3X--5N9jSTpSS-2whKeg7xR7tNc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LY6EIFHK7II6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
