The three symbols combined resemble both a flame within a circle, as well as a woman\u2019s face \u2014 and the latter is a nod to the fact that women were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time in the 1900 Paris Games.\n\n\u201cThe medal, the flame, Marianne,\u201d tweeted the official Paris 2024 account. \u201cHere is the new face of the Olympic and Paralympic Games of #Paris2024.\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udd47\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\n\nLa m\u00e9daille, la flamme, Marianne.\n\nVoici le nouveau visage des Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de #Paris2024\n\n\n\nThe medal, the flame, Marianne\n\nHere is the new face of the Olympic and Paralympic Games of #Paris2024 pic.twitter.com/6VvsItrql6 \u2014 Paris 2024 (@Paris2024) October 21, 2019\n\nPierre-Olivier Beckers-Vieujant, the International Olympic Committee coordination commission chair for the Paris Games, said in a statement that, \u201cThe combination of the gold medal, the Olympic flame and Marianne brings together the values, history and French touch that will make these Olympic Games truly special. I believe that this innovative design will be quickly recognized around the world and be a wonderful calling card for the Olympic Games Paris 2024.\u201d\n\nOh, it was recognized, all right. But not the way the organizers and designers probably intended.\n\nThe icon became an instant online Rorschach test, with many Twitter TWTR, +0.15% users trying to out-snark each other on what they thought the new logo looked like.\n\nMany played with the image\u2019s resemblance to a woman with a chic bob, likening it to Jennifer Aniston\u2019s iconic \u201cRachel\u201d haircut on \u201cFriends,\u201d or to a L\u2019Oreal LRLCY, -0.49% shampoo ad.\n\nThe Paris Olympic logo is just Rachel from Friends pic.twitter.com/MqAnPEimqs \u2014 joel (@jbhofmann) October 22, 2019\n\nIt looks more like this Fanta commercial character than Marianne. pic.twitter.com/Mznqt2hfiK \u2014 ma_victoria (@ma_victoria) October 21, 2019\n\nOthers noted it looked a lot like the Match-owned MTCH, +1.46% Tinder dating app\u2019s flame logo.\n\nLe logo des #JO @Paris2024 d\u00e9voil\u00e9, \u00e0 ne pas confondre avec @Tinder, bien que ce soit un beau clin d\u2019\u0153il \u00e0 la culture Fran\u00e7aise ! \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\ud83d\udd25\n\nSinon, un super article \u00e0 lire traitant s\u00e9rieusement de ce logo sur @lemondefr sous la plume de @NLepeltier ! \ud83d\udd8b\ufe0fhttps://t.co/nPXZ6YWQep pic.twitter.com/US0LhleICw \u2014 J.A.

She tousles her messy bob, dons breton stripes and ballet flats and whisks down the stairs from her fifth-floor apartment to grab a baguette before enigmatically texting two men who are pursuing her romantically. pic.twitter.com/5R2PVaXaa6 \u2014 Megan Clement (@MegClement) October 21, 2019\n\nThe French Olympic logo carries a photo of her grand-aunt in a locket around her neck. It\u2019s a candid shot. Coy. The French Olympic logo never got to meet her Grand-Aunt.

While its initial budget was set at about $8.1 billion, the French government warned last year that it was already at risk of running half a billion euros over budget, and that some sites might not be ready in time for the Games.", "description": "The French symbol for the 2024 Summer Games has drawn mixed reactions on Twitter.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT849_paris__ZG_20191023102119.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
