But after an eight-year inquiry, new evidence has been provided which challenges the truthfulness of his confessions.\n\nAccording to The Times, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), last week referred the case back to the Court of Appeal.\n\nNew evidence could show that police interviews with Tredget were in breach of the guidelines at the time of his arrest.\n\nDuring an investigation in 1982, Tredget, who had previously changed his named to Bruce Lee, was alleged to have been denied forensic experts to investigate the cases.\n\nTredget was pictured in 2016 on day release from a secure mental health unit (above)\n\nThe investigation also revealed that police had neglected evidence and witnesses in favour of the defence.\n\nIt claimed that some witnesses had been pressured into changing their evidence.\n\nAt the time the officer in charge of the case Detective Chief Superintendent Ronald Sagar, sued The Times for libel after it published the investigation.\n\nTredget is pictured giving a thumbs up as he left Leeds Crown Court, where he was detained for life under the Mental Health Act in 1981\n\nThis weekend it was reported that Tredget's lawyer was 'delighted by the referral' and said they were confident that there had been a 'serious miscarriage of justice' and that the revelation could take away the 'blame ascribed to him' for the deaths of the victims of those fires and that they should no longer 'be laid at his door'.\n\nBetween 1973 and 1979 investigators had first concluded that the fires had started accidentally. Despite this Humberside Police arrested Tredget, aged 19, on suspicion of murder.\n\nTredget grew up in care homes and had been bullied due to a disability.\n\nHe confessed to having started 11 fires, killing the Hastie brothers, the Dickinson brothers and their mother, as well as a six-month-old baby.\n\nNow expert evidence is said to have been obtained which calls into question his written confession.\n\nA previous confession from Tredget had been overturned in 1983 after evidence was found that the blaze in Hessle had been caused by the boiler.\n\nIn 2016 Tredget was pictured on day release and this new evidence could be painful for the victims of the families.\n\nMailOnline has contacted the CCRC.", "description": "Peter Tredget could have his case overturned after new evidence revealed that his confessions may not have been truthful.
