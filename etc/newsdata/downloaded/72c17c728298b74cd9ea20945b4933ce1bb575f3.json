We need vigilance, determination and patience\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the meeting was \u2018constructive\u2019 and that he was on his way to debrief ambassadors for the EU 27.\n\nThe unexpectedly cordial atmosphere between Johnson and Varadkar led to speculation of a possible compromise on the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland border backstop.\n\nPound Sterling rose sharply on international money markets in the wake of the talks as investors felt more confident about the outlook of Brexit.\n\nAt a press conference European Council President Donald Tusk said: \u2018I\u2019ve received promising signals from the Taoiseach that a deal is still possible.\n\n\u2018Technical talks are taking place in Brussels as we speak.\n\n\u2018Of course there\u2019s no guarantee of success and time is practically up. But even the slightest chance must be used.\u2019\n\nGood progress appears to have been made between Westminster and Brussels (Picture: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said that the Cabinet had been briefed on the meeting of the two leaders.\n\nBut would not explain what concessions may have prompted the surprise optimism.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u2018It does not benefit anyone to have a running commentary on live negotiations.\u2019\n\nAfter more than two hours of \u2018detailed and constructive\u2019 discussions at a country manor on the Wirral on Thursday, Johnson and Varadkar said it was in \u2018everybody\u2019s interest\u2019 to get an agreement which would allow the UK to leave with a deal.\n\nMr Varadkar said he hoped the progress they had made would be \u2018sufficient\u2019 to enable intensive negotiations to resume in Brussels ahead of next week\u2019s crucial EU summit.\n\nBus driver praised after taking detour to help 'sobbing' little girl get home\n\nThe Taoiseach said: \u2018I think it is possible for us to come to an agreement, to have a treaty to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, and to have that done by the end of October, but there\u2019s many a slip between cup and lip.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe refused to be drawn on any \u2018concessions\u2019 made by either side, while UK Government sources refused to be drawn on Irish press reports suggesting \u2018significant movement\u2019 by the UK.\n\nBarclay and Barnier are both due to give joint press conference later this morning (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe softer mood music after Mr Johnson\u2019s meeting with the Taoiseach followed an intensive few days which saw an acrimonious war of words explode between London, Dublin and Brussels in which the talks appeared close to collapse.\n\nBriefings by anonymous Downing Street sources had accused Varadkar of backtracking on previous commitments to try to find a deal, and of refusing to negotiate.\n\nFollowing a heated telephone call between Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday, Number 10 sources claimed the EU was making it \u2018essentially impossible\u2019 for Britain to leave with a deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, Barnier told the European Parliament there was still no basis for a fresh agreement.\n\nVaradkar said he could see a \u2018pathway\u2019 towards a deal (Picture: PA)\n\nHe said the UK had yet to put forward an \u2018operational, legally binding solution\u2019 to replace the Northern Ireland backstop \u2013 intended to prevent the return of a hard border with the Republic.\n\nWithout a deal, Johnson will face demands from opposition parties to comply with the so-called Benn Act which would require him to request a three-month Brexit delay if there is no agreement by October 19.\n\nThe PM has said while he will abide by the law, he is determined to leave on the Halloween deadline of October 31 come what may.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
