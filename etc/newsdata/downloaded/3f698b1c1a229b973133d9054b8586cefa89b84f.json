In the full report released on Thursday, an independent disciplinary committee noted Hodge \u201chad no effective knowledge\u201d of the framework and said he had not been trained on it. The committee noted its concern.\n\nCheika made a point Friday to dispute the report before announcing his team to play Wales this weekend.\n\nHe said all Australian professionals were made aware of the framework before Super Rugby began, and all of the Wallabies were reminded in July in Brisbane before the test against Argentina.\n\nCaptain Michael Hooper, sitting beside Cheika, said there was no need to remind the Wallabies again about high tackles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not training to tackle high,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cWe\u2019re training to tackle in the way you do a dominant tackle. Reece\u2019s tackle was not dominant, he goes flying off. We\u2019ve got to get our height down and that goes with being an effective tackler.\u201d\n\nCheika suggested Hodge can\u2019t be thinking about every law when he\u2019s on the field. He turned to Hooper: \u201cHoops, if you\u2019re going in to make a tackle are you thinking about the framework?\u201d\n\nHooper: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nCheika: \u201cThere you go.\u201d\n\nCheika said he and the Wallabies still did not believe Hodge\u2019s right shoulder hitting Yato\u2019s left jaw was a red card offense. The committee said it had \u201ca high degree of danger.\u201d Yato was knocked out by the hit, and the concussion has put in doubt whether he\u2019ll play any of Fiji\u2019s remaining pool games.\n\nSo why did Hodge say what he said?\n\n\u201cThe guy is already nervous enough as it is,\u201d Cheika said of Hodge\u2019s appearance at the hearing. \u201cWhen people are asking you questions and you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, you\u2019re nervous, so you may not have the answers to all the questions at the tip of your tongue.\u201d\n\nCheika said the Wallabies haven\u2019t decided whether to appeal. They have until Saturday. The team has talked about it, and the final decision will be Hodge\u2018s, the coach added.\n\nCheika also believed the suspension showed Hodge and the Wallabies were being persecuted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the boys about it, there\u2019s a bit of us versus everyone else,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be put off course from that. Not from the man chairing the hearing, or what anyone else says. If there\u2019s one bloke World Rugby is not listening to, it\u2019s me, no matter what language I speak to them in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m respected by my players here and together we\u2019ll just get on the field and start battling away on Sunday.\u201d\n\nHe was satisfied at the news conference that he\u2019d got his points across.\n\n\u201cPeople are making a point about us, we\u2019ll make the point back,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cBit of tennis.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Australia coach Michael Cheika believed suspended winger Reece Hodge misspoke when he claimed not to know World Rugby's guidance on high tackles.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/japan_rugby_wcup_australia_fiji_59640_c0-121-2891-1806_s1770x1032.jpg?06869a14be0fc2ee8a69f81c9b8c5accdd673098", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
