Florida Ethics Commission\n\nAndrew Gillum was tight-lipped during his run for governor about trips to Costa Rica and New York City, where he hit the town with a close lobbyist pal and people who later turned out to be undercover FBI agents.\n\nBut he talked plenty over the course of two sworn interviews with a Florida Commission on Ethics investigator tasked with getting to the bottom of the excursions. Recordings of the interviews, which span an hour and a half, became public following last week\u2019s unanimous move by the Ethics Commission to find probable cause that Gillum accepted illegal gifts during the trips but didn\u2019t report them.\n\nUnder the microscope are his May 2016 vacation in Costa Rica in a luxury villa overlooking the Pacific Ocean and his August 2016 outings in NYC, which included a ticket to the Broadway smash \u201cHamilton\u201d and a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThe common denominator during both trips was Adam Corey, a lobbyist and one-time close friend of Gillum who encouraged him to come along on outings and introduced him to the undercover agents. Corey served as Gillum\u2019s honorary campaign treasurer in 2014, the same year his company and the city agreed to redevelop the city\u2019s former power plant into The Edison restaurant in Cascades Park. Corey\u2019s project got $2.1 million in assistance from the city and the Community Redevelopment Agency.\n\nOthers who joined the former Tallahassee mayor on at least one of the trips include Sean Pittman, Gillum\u2019s longtime political confidante and a lobbyist for the city; Mike Miller, one of the undercover agents who posed as a developer and sought to spend time with Gillum; and Mike Sweets, another undercover agent who posed as a medical marijuana entrepreneur.\n\nHere are highlights from the Gillum recordings:\n\nFBI made \u201cno real asks\u201d until the end\n\nGillum first met with a trio of purported businessmen who were actually undercover FBI agents on May 16, 2016, at The Edison. Corey invited Gillum to the meeting while the two of them were in Costa Rica, though Gillum said there was little discussion of the meeting during the vacation.\n\nHe said when he arrived at The Edison, he noticed then-Leon County Schools Superintendent Jackie Pons wrapping up a meeting with Miller, Sweets and another undercover agent who went by Brian Butler. Pons confirmed in an interview with the Tallahassee Democrat that he met with the men at The Edison. But he doesn\u2019t recall seeing Gillum.\n\nThis photo shows the three men believed to be undercover FBI agents who used aliases and cover stories as part of an investigation in Tallahassee. Pictured from left are Mike Miller, Mike Sweets and Brian Butler. The Democrat decided to blur the physical characteristics of the men after discussions with the FBI. (Photo: Special to the Democrat)\n\nGillum said he went into \u201cfull pitch mode\u201d and told Miller and the others that Tallahassee was a thriving place to do business. Miller would later join Gillum\u2019s morning workout group, which also included Corey and Pittman.\n\n\u201cOver the year of my knowing mainly Mike Miller ... there were no real asks. It was just sort of like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m in town. You guys working out tomorrow?\u2019 He\u2019d join us at the gym. It was clear to me he was trying to build a relationship, and I wasn\u2019t sure to what end.\u201d\n\nIn early 2017, as Gillum, a Democrat, was mounting his run for governor, he asked Miller for his help. Awkwardness ensued.\n\n\u201c(Miller) said to me at that time, \u2018Listen, if I were to get some friends to help you, we would need to know that you\u2019d have our back here at the city.\u2019 And that was the first time I got really uncomfortable. At that point, it felt quid-pro-quo-ish. And at that point, I kind of pulled back, and I said, \u2018Mike we\u2019re having this conversation because I think we\u2019re friends, and I\u2019d like to have your help as I run this race. But that\u2019s kind of it for me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGillum left the meeting and immediately called Pittman to express his displeasure with Miller. Pittman, in turn, rang up the FBI agent.\n\n\u201cSean apparently reached out to Mike,\u201d Gillum said, \u201ccalls me afterward and says 'I talked to Mike. I told him ... I don\u2019t know what you did to the mayor but you like pissed him off, he feels really offended.' And from that point forward, I never heard from them again. That was it.\u201d\n\nBack story: Sean Pittman encountered 'Mike Miller,' too\n\nGillum assumed boat ride was free\n\nGillum\u2019s boat ride to the Statue of Liberty included Corey, his brother, Marcus Gillum, and two of the undercover agents, Miller and Sweets. He said he viewed Miller and Sweet\u2019s presence on the boat as \u201cmerely social\u201d and that no city business was discussed.\n\nHe said he looked up the cost of a large passenger boat ride to the monument beforehand and came up with $17. He acknowledged \u201cmaybe you add a little bit more money\u201d because he went on a private boat. But he said he wouldn\u2019t have paid $100, the threshold that requires public officials to report gifts. He said he\u2019d been on fancy boats and yachts before and, \u201cThis was not that.\u201d\n\nHe added, however, that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the boat ride.\n\nBrothers Marcus and Andrew Gillum and lobbyist/friend Adam Corey during a New York harbor boat ride with undercover FBI agents. (Photo: Photos subpoenaed by the state ethics commission)\n\n\u201cI did not assume a cost to the boat ride,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one said this is what it\u2019s going to cost. The way it happened was Mike said he had a friend who had a boat in the harbor, do we want to go out to the Statue of Liberty? I was like, \u2018Sure.\u2019\n\nHe said he didn't question it because \"it was really nothing.\"\n\n\"I shouldn\u2019t say nothing,\" he said, correcting himself. \"In retrospect, I understand the gravity of all of this. But at the time it didn\u2019t trigger for me that that was a real expense. I understood it to be Mike\u2019s friend\u2019s boat. He had it in the dock. We literally went out and were back in like an hour.\u201d\n\nGillum said the New York trip grew out of talk among his friends of having a \u201cguy\u2019s trip.\u201d But a couple of women with ties to Miller joined them on the boat outing. It\u2019s unclear whether they were undercover agents, too.\n\n\u201cOne was introduced as like Mike\u2019s ex-girlfriend,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cAnd Mike\u2019s ex-girlfriend brought her girlfriend, an African-American woman. And they were on the boat.\u201d\n\nGillum denies he got ticket from FBI\n\nQuestions about who paid for Gillum\u2019s ticket to \u201cHamilton\u201d on his last night in New York City dogged him during last year\u2019s general election. During a debate with future Gov. Ron DeSantis, Gillum quipped, \u201cWe got 99 issues and \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ain\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cHamilton\u201d continues to be an issue for Gillum, who insists he got the ticket from his brother, Marcus. Under Florida law, public officials are not required to disclose gifts from relatives.\n\nBuy Photo The Florida Commission on Ethics holds a public meeting before holding a probable cause hearing into an ethics complaint previously filed against former Mayor Andrew Gillum Friday, Jan. 25, 2019 at the First District Court of Appeals in Tallahassee. (Photo: Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat)\n\n\u201cI met them on the sidewalk,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was in front of the theater itself, but there was a rendezvous. (Marcus) didn\u2019t really tell me about plans. I walked up. He gave me a ticket. And that was it.\u201d\n\nGillum said he assumed at the time that Corey bought the ticket and he and Marcus \u201cworked it out, that Marcus paid his fair share.\u201d However, Corey said in a sworn affidavit that Miller, the undercover agent, bought the tickets and paid for the boat ride.\n\n\u201cI and to the best of my knowledge the others, including Gillum, were aware Miller had paid for and provided the tickets ... and boat tour,\u201d Corey wrote. \u201cI did not pay for any expenses associated with \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ... or the boat tour.\u201d\n\nCorey told Gillum as much in a text sent after their arrival in New York City. \u201cMike Miller and the crew\u201d had tickets for them to see the show, Corey said. \u201cAwesome news about \u2018Hamilton\u2019 \u201d Gillum replied.\n\nGillum said it was his second time seeing \"Hamilton.\" He said the first time he saw the show, it was with the original cast. Tickets, he said, were about $700 then.\n\nHe told the Ethics Commission investigator that he never asked his brother whether he bought the \"Hamilton\" ticket.\n\n\"When this all came up, I was advised not to sort of engage any more deeply in any sort of background on that,\" Gillum said. \"I had retained counsel on another matter and it was basically their advice. Like you don\u2019t need to know anything you don\u2019t know at this point.\"\n\nMarcus in the middle\n\nGillum fielded questions about his younger brother Marcus Gillum, who he said lived with him at one point in Tallahassee before he moved to Chicago. Marcus Gillum and Corey became friends, hanging out when the two were in Tallahassee and going to sporting events in South Florida together.\n\nHe said their uncle had a car dealership in Atlanta and that car sales took Marcus Gillum to a more competitive market in Chicago. He said his brother lived with one of Corey's friends in Chicago for a time.\n\nHe said his brother was currently working for a \u201creal estate tech firm\u201d and sells its app at conventions. But he said he didn\u2019t know the name of the business.\n\nGillum said it wasn\u2019t unusual for his brother to get him tickets to sporting events. In turn he gave his brother tickets to expensive events in Beverly Hills hosted by the People for the American Way, which he noted is \u201ca very celebrity heavy organization.\u201d\n\nWhen asked specifically by the investigator, Gillum denied that his brother was ever on Miller\u2019s payroll. Miller operated a fictional, FBI front company called Southern Pines Development.\n\n\u201cHeck no,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine under what circumstances he would have ever worked for Mike. There would be no reason for that. That would shock me.\u201d\n\nLater, Gillum added, \u201cYou\u2019ve kind of blown me (away) with the Mike Miller worked-for thing.\u201d\n\nGillum downplayed Corey\u2019s lobbying\n\nGillum acknowledged Corey lobbied him on behalf of Yellow Cab in 2015, when the city was drafting an ordinance on vehicles for hire that allowed Uber to operate in town. Gillum joined in a unanimous City Commission vote in support of an ordinance that included significant concessions to Uber.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Gillum replied when asked if Corey lobbied him. \u201cThe one I recall is the Uber/taxi cab. They officially met with me in my capacity. So on that issue, yes.\u201d\n\nBuy Photo Adam Corey's lobbying firm, Unconventional Strategies, is located on All Saints Street in Tallahassee. (Photo: Jeff Burlew/Democrat)\n\nBut Gillum later denied Corey did \u201chard lobbying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I had to best describe it, he was an introducer,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cAt least in my encounters, he didn\u2019t really hard lobby people. What he did was bring people together, it seems like. He certainly didn\u2019t do hard lobbying work with me. And part of that could have been the friendship as well.\u201d\n\nThe Uber issue later became part of a federal grand jury\u2019s indictment of Gillum\u2019s former colleague, suspended City Commissioner Scott Maddox, and former Downtown Improvement Authority Executive Director Paige Carter-Smith on public corruption charges. The indictment alleges a \u201cCompany B,\u201d believed to be Uber, paid Maddox and Carter-Smith\u2019s Governance firm $30,000 in exchange for their support.\n\n'That\u2019s not how I roll'\n\nGillum said he didn\u2019t show political favoritism when he supported Corey\u2019s proposal for The Edison. Corey\u2019s idea beat out another proposal by the Ghazvini family, who are prominent local builders and developers and prodigious political donors.\n\nBuy Photo Mayor Andrew Gillum listened as his friend lobbyist Adam Corey spoke at the 2015 opening of the city-backed Edison restaurant. (Photo: D.A. Robin/Democrat)\n\n\u201cA lot of people like to make hay that you know Andrew favored Adam and gave them this contract because he helped his campaign and was campaign treasurer,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cAdam probably by that point had contributed maybe $500 to me. The Ghazvini family ... probably raised more than $50,000. So if I was going to be partial to somebody because of campaign contributions, which I would not be \u2014 let me be very clear about this, that\u2019s not how I roll \u2014 certainly the folks who raised me $50,000 toward my campaigns would seem to be the ones that I would be leaning toward.\u201d\n\nGillum said he wasn\u2019t leaning toward anyone in particular.\n\n\u201cAn RFP was put on the street,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Ghazvini response ... there was no concept, no idea for what they wanted to have happen. Adam and his partners\u2019 response was a brewery, a coffee shop, a restaurant, high end. Everyone fell in love with the concept.\u201d\n\nBack story: Risk, 'growing pains' and the Edison investment\n\nContact Jeff Burlew at jburlew@tallahassee.com or follow @JeffBurlew on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/fbi/2019/02/03/andrew-gillum-his-own-words-ethics-allegations/2737588002/", "description": "Andrew Gillum was tight-lipped during his run for governor on ethics allegations involving his out-of-town trips.
