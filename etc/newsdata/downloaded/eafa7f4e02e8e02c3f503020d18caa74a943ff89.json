The Duchess of Sussex still made an appearance on set, alongside editor in chief Edward Enninful, when it came time to photograph Gemma Chan, Yara Shahidi, Laverne Cox, and the rest of the women featured. And in typical Markle fashion, she chose an easy, sensible piece from one of her go-to brands.\n\nIn a behind-the-scenes video posted to British Vogue's Instagram, Markle is seen laughing and looking over some of the shots Peter Lindbergh captured with Enninful. She's wearing a black sleeveless jumpsuit that fans quickly identified as being from Everlane, a brand the duchess has worn many times in the past.\n\nAccording to @MeghansMirror (and its \"special source\"), Markle donned Everlane's Japanese GoWeave Essential Jumpsuit. It's available in three colors\u2014dusty blue, olive, and the duchess's chosen black\u2014and in sizes 00 through 16. It retails for $120.\n\nMarkle actually carried an Everlane tote on her first public appearance with Prince Harry, at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto.\n\nDay 3: Invictus Games Toronto 2017 Samir Hussein More", "description": "She's now worn it at least twice.", "authors": ["Ana Col\u00f3n"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Celx6Nwq6feblVfE.ndmPQ--~B/aD0yMjQwO3c9Mjk2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/a62e34f0efe6720bd3dcb9768b592412", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
