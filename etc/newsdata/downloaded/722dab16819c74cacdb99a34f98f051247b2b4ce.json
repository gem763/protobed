I was trying to do my job as a reporter, and I think I did so to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the story broke, Calvin said he began receiving a barrage of death threats. He said HR reps at Gannett, which owns the Des Moines Register, forbade him from speaking to the media and told him to leave his apartment for his own safety. They offered to put him up in a hotel, but he stayed with a friend instead.", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Juliareinstein Des-Moines-Register-Iowa-Reporter-Fired-Aaron-Calvin-Carson"], "top_image": ""}
