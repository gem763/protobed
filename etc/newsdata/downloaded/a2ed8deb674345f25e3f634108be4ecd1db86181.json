More importantly, though, the rousing adaptation of Christine Leunens\u2019 novel \u201cCaging Skies\u201d teaches a resonant lesson on love vs. learned that's set during one of the most heinous periods in history.\n\nCentering on a conflicted 10-year-old boy (Roman Griffin Davis) and his loving mother (Scarlett Johansson), \u201cJojo\u201d looks at Nazi Germany\u2019s anti-Jew world view and aims to take away its power through relentless mockery. Familiar faces like Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson and Stephen Merchant play various degrees of buffoonery, while \u201cHeil, Hitler!\u201d is demoted from white supremacy salute to a \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d greeting.\n\nScarlett Johansson: The actress embarks on a new chapter with 'Jojo Rabbit' and 'Marriage Story'\n\n'Jojo Rabbit: Director Taika Waititi calls satire a 'love letter to mothers'\n\nIt\u2019s the waning days of World War II and the Allies are close to defeating Hitler\u2019s army, yet Jojo remains blindly fanatical to the cause. He goes to Nazi youth training weekends, which involve burning books and throwing hand grenades, but he\u2019s bullied because of his small size and lack of a killer instinct. Jojo's main confidante is Adolf, his hero come to life as imaginary friend/hype man/self-help guru.\n\nJewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, left) throws young Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) and Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) for a loop in the anti-war, pro-love satire \"Jojo Rabbit.\" (Photo: KIMBERLEY FRENCH)\n\nAfter blowing himself up, a scarred, recovering Jojo does odd jobs for Captain Klenzendorf (Rockwell), a gay Nazi soldier losing confidence in the war effort, though always under the watchful eye of mom Rosie. With Jojo\u2019s dad working out of the country, Rosie tries to keep the politics to a minimum in her house. But Jojo finds out her biggest secret: His mother is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), behind a wall in the bedroom of his late older sister.\n\nThis blows the kid\u2019s mind since he\u2019s been taught Jews are monstrous, mind-reading devils who should be hunted down. Instead, Jojo is drawn to Elsa\u2019s fiery strength \u2013 as he and his mom also grow closer in heartfelt fashion \u2013 but he\u2019s also torn: He\u2019s been taught to turn in Jews, though knows doing so would threaten both him and Rosie.\n\nJohansson really shines in her role as a loving parent who has her adorable eccentricities yet tries to keep Jojo from growing up too fast. The youngsters are stellar as well: Audiences will fall for McKenzie as easily as Jojo does, Davis is a star in the making, and Archie Yates is a hoot as Jojo\u2019s nigh-indestructible pal Yorki.\n\nScarlett Johansson (with Sam Rockwell, left, and Roman Griffin Davis) stars as a loving German mom in the big-hearted \"Jojo Rabbit.\" (Photo: LARRY HORRICKS)\n\nWaititi (\u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d) balances dark comedy and a warm heart throughout, plus embraces his inner Mel Brooks when setting footage of Hitler-heiling legions to The Beatles' German version of \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand.\u201d But it\u2019s what the New Zealand director does in front of the camera that\u2019s most remarkable.\n\nPlaying the most evil person pretty much ever \u2013 and with such virtuosic style \u2013 would seem tricky for any thespian, though Waititi\u2019s genius comes through in Adolf\u2019s arc: Sure, he\u2019s all witty and weirdly appealing at first, yet as Jojo turns more of his attention toward Elsa, Hitler subtly transforms into the petty, angry monster from the history books, with Waititi exhibiting the dramatic real-life mannerisms of the infamous dictator.\n\n\u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d succeeds even with a high degree of difficulty, given the sensitivities of the subject matter, the emotional undercurrent of a mother\u2019s devotion to her son and the breaking down of artificial walls to let love in. As much as it makes you laugh, Waititi\u2019s must-watch effort is a warm hug of a movie that just so happens to have a lot of important things to say.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/17/jojo-rabbit-review-taika-waititi-mocks-hitler-brilliant-wwii-satire/3999929002/", "description": "Taika Waititi directs and plays the goofiest Adolf Hitler ever in the terrific World War II satire \"Jojo Rabbit,\" starring Scarlett Johansson.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published A.M.
