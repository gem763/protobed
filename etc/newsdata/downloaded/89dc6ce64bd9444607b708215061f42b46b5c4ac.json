(Getty Images)\n\nMarkelle Fultz hasn\u2019t played a game yet for the Orlando Magic, but the team is giving him a vote of confidence. The Magic picked up Fultz\u2019s 2020-21 option Monday, guaranteeing the former No. 1 overall pick will make a little over $12 million next season.\n\nThe team made that call despite not knowing when Fultz will return to the court. Fultz, 21, has been out since November due to thoracic outlet syndrome. The injury impacts the nerves, and can cause pain and numbness in the shoulder and neck. In August, Magic team president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman said the team has no timetable for Fultz\u2019s return.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat\u2019s been the case with Fultz most of his career. Since the Philadelphia 76ers selected Fultz with the first pick of the 2017 NBA draft, Fultz has played in just 33 regular season games due to shooting woes and injuries. He\u2019s averaged just 7.7 points and 3.4 assists per game. The 76ers gave up on Fultz last season, dealing him to the Magic in February.\n\nThe Magic\u2019s timing is curious considering the team had until Oct. 31 to pick up Fultz\u2019s option. The team is either satisfied with Fultz\u2019s offseason work, believes $12 million is a small price to pay to see whether Fultz gets it together or is simply sending Fultz\u2019s a message of encouragement.\n\nWhile Fultz\u2019s career hasn\u2019t gotten off to a tremendous start, things could improve if he can bounce back from his injury. Considering his age, there\u2019s still plenty of time for Fultz to go on to have a productive NBA career.\n\nThat might not happen in 2020-21, but the Magic are willing to wager $12 million that Fultz shows some improvement next season.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nStory continues\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
