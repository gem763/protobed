I was not in a good place. Football was bringing me down, and I didn't like it. I was losing that joy in life.\"\n\nGronkowski added he \"could barely walk\" after New England's victory over the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII because of a quad injury he suffered during the game.\n\nDespite all of the injuries, Gronkowski told Ninan he would allow his son\u2014should he have one\u2014to play football after he educated him about the game and everything he went through to play.\n\nGronkowski retired at age 29 after nine years with the Patriots.
