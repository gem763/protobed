(Michael Reaves / Getty Images)\n\nLate in the second quarter, Tom Brady lofted a back-shoulder pass to the left side of the end zone and, while being closely covered, Antonio Brown hauled it in for a touchdown, a reminder of the singular talent he possesses on a football field.\n\nThere were also some signs pregame of the distractions Brown can bring. He was barefoot on the field during warm-ups and, in a move that might not have delighted New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, he did a pregame interview with Chad Ochocinco, the former wide receiver whose career in New England was mercifully brief.\n\nAs the lawsuit in which a woman accuses Brown of rape and sexual assault progresses, he was making his first appearance with the Patriots since signing with the team Sept. 7. Brady wasted no time in getting Brown involved in the offense. Brown caught four passes (on five targets) for 56 yards, carried once for five yards on an end around and scored on that 20-yard TD pass, his momentum carrying him over the wall behind the end zone and giving the Patriots a 13-0 halftime lead.\n\nBrown wore the jersey No. 17, which his father wore in the Arena League, and he immediately hugged Brady upon taking the field for pregame warm-ups. During the game, he often sat next to fellow receiver Julian Edelman, who helped him adjust to what Brady expects from his wideouts.\n\n[Antonio Brown's accuser to meet Monday with NFL officials]\n\nWhatever Brown\u2019s thoughts on his game, he wasn\u2019t sharing them. Reporters at the game noted that, by the time media members were admitted to the locker room, Brown had left, with his locker cleaned out and his name plate removed.\n\nBrady downplayed Brown\u2019s presence.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about it. I was just trying to throw to the open guy,\u201d Brady said of the touchdown. And as for deciding to sign Brown, he shrugged that off as an executive decision. Josh Gordon was more expansive.\n\n\u201cHe continues to be who we expected him to be,\u201d receiver Josh Gordon, who caught two passes for 19 yards, told reporters, \u201cand that\u2019s a great wide receiver and good football player. For us it\u2019s a tremendous asset. ... There\u2019s no way you can pinpoint one facet of our offense to shut us down. ... We\u2019re glad to have him.\u201d\n\nThe first-half yards were the extent of the contributions from Brown, who did not play in the preseason with the Oakland Raiders, despite being targeted three more times in the second half of New England\u2019s 43-0 victory. Brady finished with 264 yards passing, completing 20 of 28 passes for two touchdowns and sneaking for one himself. Julian Edelman caught four passes for 51 yards, Phillip Dorsett had three receptions for 39 yards. Sony Michel had 21 carries for 85 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBut will the Patriots offense, which has outscored opponents 76-3 in two games, continue to have Brown? And for how long? Multiple people familiar with the case have said it remains possible that the NFL will place Brown on the exempt list, which would make him ineligible to play for and practice with the team, The Post\u2019s Mark Maske reports. The league hopes to make its decision soon, although it isn\u2019t clear whether that will come down this week. Brown\u2019s accuser will meet with NFL officials on Monday.\n\nBrown has not been charged with a crime, but the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy empowers Commissioner Roger Goodell to place Brown on the exempt list if, after an investigation, he believes that policy may have been violated.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nFor the first time in his career, Aaron Rodgers is wearing a play sheet on his wrist\n\nWho\u2019s Gardner Minshew II?
