According to the Wall Street Journal, Sondland originally told a House Committee that there was no quid pro quo. He changed his testimony after Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who heard the call directly, said there was.\n\n\"Nothing was ever raised to me about any concerns regarding our Ukraine policy,\" Sondland stated under oath but was recently contradicted by Vindman in ongoing testimony.\n\nSondland may have committed perjury\n\nDemocratic Rep. Joaquin Castro posted on Twitter that he believes Amb. Sondland committed perjury during his hearing with the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nBased on all the testimony so far, I believe that Ambassador Gordon Sondland committed perjury. https://t.co/lOGRj8s1yP \u2014 Joaquin Castro (@JoaquinCastrotx) October 29, 2019\n\nDuring his testimony, Sondland told investigators that he consulted directly with President Donald Trump before sending out a text to the Ukraine Ambassador saying there was no quid pro quo. Sondland was seen on Capitol Hill with reports saying he was there to go over his previous testimony.\n\nSondland, a major donor to the Trump campaign, was already being watched by Democrats due to his inexperience with international diplomacy and that he had no prior experience in politics in general.\n\nVindman calls Ukraine call concerning\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active Army member called the Trump/Ukraine call concerning and raised the call with a lawyer, according to the Associated Press. Vindman reported the concerns to the NSC's lead counsel.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. Democratic Party\n\nSome Republican lawmakers questioned Vidman's loyalty to the United States due to him being born in Eastern Europe. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney pushed backed on some Republicans, saying it was \"shameful\" to question his loyalty to the US.\n\nVindman's testimony marks a drastic move in the impeachment inquiry since Vindman was one of the members who listened in on call. There were some concerns Vindman would not show up to testify so House Democrats subpoenaed him a few hours before the testimony was to take place.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Twitter raged about the testimony, calling the inquiry a \"hoax\" and and a \"disgrace.\" Other GOP members joined in calling for an end to the inquiry after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a vote on Thursday to authorize further moves in the inquiry. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida called the inquiry \"devoid of rules.\"\n\nSpeaker Pelosi's announcement today acknowledges Adam Schiff\u2019s free-wheeling impeachment inquiry is devoid of rules and lacks legitimacy. Schiff\u2019s anarchic impeachment sham has devolved into mayhem and is entirely antithetical to constitutional principles. \u2014 Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 28, 2019\n\nVindman's testimony is sure to bring even more legitimacy to the inquiry as he one of the most high profile members to testify following former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was fired by Trump because she didn't agree with what he wanted to do when it came to funding Ukraine defenses.", "description": "European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland tells Congress there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine.
