He said the disease ran in his family.\n\nThe revelation came amid continued public speculation about his health. There have been periods when the famously bombastic president has been out of the public eye for days, prompting headlines guessing about his whereabouts and even rumors of his death.\n\nBut his communications officers have said that Duterte, 74, like any other older person, needs his own personal time.\n\nThe president revealed the ailment after he apparently made a joke about not being able to look straight at a woman with whom he had danced a duet during the event in Moscow.\n\n\u201cI have a talent,\u201d Duterte said, according to official transcripts provided by his office afterward. \u201cWhen I look at you, my other eye droops. Do you see? The other eye is smaller. It goes where it wants.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cActually, that\u2019s myasthenia gravis. It\u2019s a nerve malfunction.\u201d\n\nDuterte said his grandfather had also had the disease, adding, \u201cSo I believe, really, in genetics.\u201d\n\nThe disease often affects the muscles that control the eyes, facial expression, speaking and swallowing, according to the Philippine Medical Association.\n\nDuterte came to power in 2016 vowing to rid the country of drug dealers and to wipe out other crimes. Since then, the Philippines\u2019 war on drugs has led to thousands of killings allegedly by police and vigilantes, which rights groups have denounced as an atrocity.\n\nThis year, the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights Council voted to examine the thousands of killings linked to Duterte\u2019s campaign.\n\nOver the years, his public outbursts have included insults against women, the United States and God.\n\nIn May, the president dropped out of sight for a week, prompting concerns on social media. His aides later tried to quell the rumors by releasing photographs of Duterte having breakfast.\n\nOne image showed him with the latest issue of a newspaper, suggesting an effort to prove that the picture had been taken on the same day.\n\nLast year, Duterte revealed that he had undergone an endoscopy and colonoscopy and that doctors had found he had, he said, \u201ca bad case of Barrett.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, in which the contents of the stomach flow backward into the esophagus.\n\nThe president has also said he has Buerger\u2019s disease, which leads to constriction of blood vessels in the arms and legs.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "MANILA, Philippines -- President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has revealed that he has a neuromuscular disease that has led to a slew of medical problems, including making his eye droop.Duterte, who was in Russia for a state visit, told the Filipino community there Saturday night that he has myasthenia", "authors": ["Jason Gutierrez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HvJkcZdzM8vRwykAdBEtyg--~B/aD0xNDcxO3c9MTk2OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/5254a140-e934-11e9-918f-f274fa8b18c6", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
