I was raised by a hardworking single mom, a grandmother who taught me what everyday activism looks like, and an aunt who showed me what it means to be a fighter. Especially now that I\u2019m a parent myself \u2014 a mother of two young girls \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine anything better than providing my daughters with the same kind of upbringing these phenomenal women gave me.\n\nBut the more I\u2019ve thought about the challenges of raising girls in this moment \u2014 and about the America I\u2019d like my daughters to grow up in \u2014 the more I\u2019ve compared notes with friends who are raising boys.\n\nWhy? Because the fight for progress on behalf of women and girls cannot rest exclusively on our shoulders; men and boys have essential roles to play, as well. Restrictive ideas about masculinity and gender roles are transforming, but not quickly enough. And as the national conversation continues to evolve, we must ensure that it doesn\u2019t leave boys behind \u2014 or let their parents off the hook.\n\nEven as infants, boys tend to be touched and held less than girls; by the time they reach adolescence, many are emotionally difficult to reach, stunted by years of overt and implicit pressure to mask their anxieties, prove their \u201cmanliness,\u201d and fit stereotypes that specifically exclude anything that could be perceived as feminine. According to Liz Plank\u2019s powerful new book For the Love of Men, the result is not just inner turmoil but an elevated risk of emotional and interpersonal conflict, or even violence \u2014 much of it targeting the women around them.\n\nClearly, we have a responsibility to both boys and girls to do better \u2014 for men\u2019s own sake, but also because raising healthier, more mindful men has enormous potential to improve the lives of girls and women. As long as men hold a place of privilege and power in our society, they have both the opportunity and obligation to use that position to lift up the people around them. Which is one of many reasons why, throughout my career, I\u2019ve been vocal about the importance and impact of male allyship.\n\nFrom the young partner at my former law firm who gave me a literal seat at the table during a big meeting, to my all-time greatest champion \u2014 my dad \u2014 I\u2019ve always been grateful for those who understand that representation matters. And I\u2019ve seen, time and again, that men who use their influence to help bring women\u2019s voices into the conversation don\u2019t diminish their own power; they enhance everyone\u2019s.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019ve also seen that the opposite is true. In the same way an individual male ally can enhance everyone\u2019s power, a man steeped in destructive ideas about masculinity can wreak havoc \u2014 and is even, according to Plank, more likely to engage in sexual harassment.\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on this even more over the past few weeks, as we marked the anniversary of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s telling her story before the nation during Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court nomination hearings. Her testimony centered on Kavanaugh\u2019s behavior when he was a boy \u2014 a high-school student living under his parents\u2019 roof.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s treatment of Dr. Ford and other girls his age ranged from boorish and demeaning to (alleged) sexual assault. And his response as an adult was not to display empathy, humility, responsibility, accountability, or even emotional maturity; instead he raged on national television and attacked survivors, as if he were the victim.\n\nOf course, no parent can prevent their child\u2019s ultimate actions. But surely the example set by now-Justice Kavanaugh \u2014 both in his treatment of girls and women years ago and in his behavior at last September\u2019s hearing \u2014 is not an example we\u2019d want any of our children to follow.\n\nI thought about my daughters a lot as I watched coverage of Dr. Ford\u2019s brave testimony. I had been particularly concerned about the message this hearing would send to survivors and young girls everywhere \u2014 and the need for male voices to join the chorus of solidarity with Dr. Ford. So, inspired by a group of 1,600 Black women who\u2019d run an ad in support of Anita Hill three decades earlier, I helped organize a \u201c1,600 Men\u201d campaign that gathered more than 13,000 signatures \u2014 and raised enough money to run our own full-page ad in The New York Times \u2014 declaring that countless men in America \u201cfollow in the footsteps of those courageous women,\u201d and that \u201cwomen should no longer have to carry these burdens alone.\u201d", "description": "Today, as we mark the eighth annual International Day of the Girl, a United Nations observance that focuses attention and resources on the fight for girls\u2019 rights and empowerment, I\u2019ve actually been reflecting on boys: that is, how we raise boys in this country.All my life, I\u2019ve been surrounded by strong", "authors": ["Meena Harris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y5Myhy77I7eQlm.86uzydw--~B/aD0xMDI0O3c9ODUzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/refinery29_778/9dae7c679e1fde4d246f144f3b487439", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
