Dick Durbin, speaking about the impeach, impeach, impeach mentality of his fellow Democrats, said it\u2019s high time his fellow Democrats stepped away from the impeach, impeach, impeach mentality.\n\nFinally. A Democrat who can see the 2020 writing on the wall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get beyond this \u2018impeachment is the answer to every problem,\u2019\u201d Durbin said, Politico reported. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic. If that\u2019s how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we\u2019re ignoring the issues that means a lot to them as families.\u201d\n\nUmm \u2014 that\u2019s \u2018cause they are.\n\nSince Trump Won the White House days, the Democrats in office have done nothing but call for his impeachment.\n\nFirst Russia collusion. Then Russia obstruction. Then Sharpie-gate. Then Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Now Rep. Jerry Nadler and his House Judiciary Committee inquiry into the inquiring of the possibility of impeachment, or something like that. Even Nadler admits that it\u2019s bogus.\n\nYet on he goes.\n\nOn go all the Democrats.\n\nImpeachment: It\u2019s become the Democrats\u2019 go-to political strategy to fight policy disagreements.\n\nNow it\u2019s become troublesome and ridiculous for even Durbin.\n\n\u201cGet real,\u201d he said, when asked about the calls to impeach Kavanaugh.\n\nIf only fellow Dems would take his advice. Maybe then the country could actually lose some of the hyperpartisan divisiveness and start to move forward as a nation. Out of many, one.
