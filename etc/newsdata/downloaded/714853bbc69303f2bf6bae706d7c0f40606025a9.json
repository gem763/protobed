He is thought to have been in his late forties at the time.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Bin Laden's compound in 2012, before it was completely demolished\n\nLittle is known about his personal life, other than that he came from a humble background and graduated from Khyber Medical College in 1990. His family have been living in hiding since his arrest, fearing militant attacks.\n\nHis wife is an educationalist from Abbottabad who was principal of a government school before they went into hiding. The couple have three children - two boys and a girl, at least two of them now adults.\n\nIn January 2012, US officials publicly admitted that Dr Afridi had worked for US intelligence.\n\nBut it's far from clear how much he knew about his role for the CIA. He said nothing to this effect during his deposition at the Abbottabad Commission into the killing.\n\nDr Afridi did not know who the target of the operation was when the CIA recruited him, according to a Pakistani investigation.\n\nWhat was he convicted of?\n\nAlthough initially accused of treason, Dr Afridi was ultimately jailed in May 2012, having been found guilty of funding Lashkar-e-Islam, a banned militant group that is now defunct.\n\nHe was sentenced to 33 years in prison for alleged links to the group by a tribal court, although this was later reduced to 23 years on appeal.\n\nDr Afridi was also accused of offering emergency medical aid to its fighters and allowing the group to hold meetings in the government hospital he headed.\n\nHis family have vehemently denied these charges and his lawyers say the only money he ever paid the group was a ransom of 1m Pakistani rupees (\u00a35,200; $6,375) to secure his release after they kidnapped him in 2008.\n\nFrom his jail cell in 2012 he reportedly told Fox News that he had been kidnapped and tortured by Pakistani intelligence.\n\nA year later he managed to smuggle a hand-written letter to his lawyers, saying he'd been denied justice.\n\nSo, why wasn't he charged with helping the US?\n\nThat's not very clear, but the Bin Laden affair was a huge embarrassment for Pakistan.\n\nAlthough officials were furious with what they viewed as a violation of sovereignty, the intelligence services had to publicly admit they had no idea that the founder and leader of al-Qaeda had been living there in secret, in a three-storey building behind high walls, for several years.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Soldiers cleared debris from Bin Laden's compound after the US raid in May 2011\n\nThe White House's then-counter-terrorism chief, John Brennan, said at the time that it was \"inconceivable that Bin Laden did not have a support system\" in Pakistan, an accusation rejected by Islamabad.\n\nBut to charge Dr Afridi for his role in the US operation would have meant even more bad publicity.\n\nWhy is his case being heard in the courts only now?\n\nSo far, the legal process has taken place under British-era Frontier Crimes Regulations, which governed the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) along the border with Afghanistan until last year.\n\nTribal courts were presided over by administrative officials, aided by a council of largely pliable tribal elders, and were not bound to follow due process.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John Simpson on how the world's most wanted man evaded capture for so long\n\nThat was seen as a convenient way of dealing with Dr Afridi, largely out of public sight.\n\nBut the merger of the tribal areas with adjoining Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province last year means cases have been moved to regular Pakistani courts.\n\nAt Wednesday's hearing he could have his sentence cut or it could be increased, as prosecutors will argue.\n\nSince he was moved last year from a Peshawar jail to one in Punjab, there's even been talk that he could be released, possibly in a prisoner swap with Aafia Siddiqui, an alleged al-Qaeda operative currently jailed in the US.", "description": "Shakil Afridi was accused of running a fake vaccination scheme and says he never got a fair trial.", "authors": ["M Ilyas Khan", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/437B/production/_109157271_2f4117f0-2b9b-4248-b61b-0c92e8a18b78.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
