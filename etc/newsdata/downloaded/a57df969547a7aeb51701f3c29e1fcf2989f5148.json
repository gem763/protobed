It is clear that without fiscal stimulus, Draghi\u2019s final stunt will not necessarily lead to a happy end.\u201d\n\nThe European benchmark Stoxx 600 index rose 0.6 percent following the announcement, but European bank stocks slumped and the euro was down 0.4 percent against the dollar, implying Draghi\u2019s \u201cbazooka\u201d package still disappointed investors.\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump seized on the widely expected stimulus package in a tweet Thursday. \u201cThey are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports. And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe president has repeatedly complained about the ECB\u2019s use of negative interest rates to spur growth. On Wednesday, he issued his first call to the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates below zero. But his push for such emergency steps is at odds with his customary boasts about the strength of the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cThe USA should always be paying the lowest rate,\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday. \u201cNo Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u2018Boneheads.\u2019\"\n\nAD\n\nTurkey slashed its interest rate by 3.25 percentage points Thursday, just before the ECB stimulus announcement, joining the growing list of central banks across Europe, Asia and Australia that have lowered interest rates in recent months, with many attributing the need for economic stimulus to the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war. The conflict, which has dragged on for more than a year, is upending global supply chains and significantly dampening trade volumes, causing contractions in powerful, export-driven economies like Germany.\n\nAD\n\nIn July, the Fed cut the benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than a decade, lowering it by a quarter-point, to just below 2.25 percent. The last time the Fed cut rates to zero was during the Great Recession, and it has never adopted negative rates. Investors are eagerly awaiting next week\u2019s Fed rate-setting committee meeting to see whether the central bank will bow to the president\u2019s demands and cut rates again.\n\nEuropean Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2019\n\nDraghi brushed off Trump\u2019s tweets Thursday during the news conference.\n\n\u201cWe have a mandate,\u201d Draghi said. \u201cWe pursue price stability, and we don\u2019t target exchange rates.
