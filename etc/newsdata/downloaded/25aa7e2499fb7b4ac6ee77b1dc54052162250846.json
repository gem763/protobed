The mysterious missive also claimed that the dirt came from \"Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n\nThe Trump team originally dismissed suggestions that Veselnitskaya\u2019s subsequent summit with Don Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner was evidence of collusion with the Russian government.\n\nVeselnitskaya insisted that she met the Trump team in a private capacity, and was not directed by Russian officials. The charge sheet made public on Tuesday makes clear that she was in close contact with senior Russian officials. Veselnitskaya was so deeply trusted by the Kremlin that she was allowed to draft and edit Russia\u2019s official response to a U.S. judicial request.\n\nOne of the main targets of Veselnitskya\u2019s operation\u2014named in the indictment as CEO-1\u2014was Bill Browder, a U.S.-born hedge fund manager who once operated out of Russia. She and Putin both claim that Browder had carried out the fraud Prevezon was accused of laundering.\n\nThe Southern District\u2019s indictment suggests that Veselnitskaya is central to Russia\u2019s persecution of Browder, a task that is very close to Putin\u2019s heart. The hostility dates back to 2009 when Browder\u2019s lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, died in Russian custody.\n\nTuesday\u2019s indictment even caught Browder by surprise. \u201cThis shows that every aspect of the Russians dirty operation\u2014which is not just limited to Prevezon but much more broadly\u2014is coming out. This is the definition of karma,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cAt the end of this process there will be no secrets.\u201d\n\nThe revelation that Veselnitskya was allowed to craft official documents in the name of the prosecutor general\u2019s office as part of her role in lobbying against Browder exposes the true nature of Russia\u2019s judicial system.\n\n\u201cThe Russians just came up with new charges against me and another Interpol notice, this indictment just means that all their bogus charges are going to be ignored by everybody,\u201d Browder said. \u201cIt also shows what a totally haphazard operation the Russians really run.\u201d\n\nVeselnitskaya began representing Prevezon in 2015, when former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara pursued a $230 million money-laundering case against the company.\n\nThe company ultimately settled with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for $5.9 million in 2017 and after some wrangling over how to pay, Prevezon agreed in 2018 that it would fork over the money, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAs a lawyer for Prevezon, Veselnitskaya allegedly filed \u201can intentionally misleading declaration\u201d to fight prosecutors allegations of financial wrongdoings. This declaration detailed \u201csupposed investigative findings by the Russian government\u2014findings purportedly exonerating Veselnitskaya\u2019s clients\u2014under the false pretense that these findings had been independently drafted by the Russian government.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Veselnitskaya hid the fact \u201cas a member of the defense team in the Prevezon action,\u201d she \u201chad participated in drafting those supposed exculpatory investigative findings in secret cooperation with a senior Russian prosecutor,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nWhen Veslnitskaya got involved in the Prevezon case, prosecutors were trying to recover millions in property, largely in New York, on the basis this real estate was used in laundering money from a \u201cRussian tax fraud scheme,\u201d also referred to as the \u201cRussian Treasury Fraud.\u201d\n\nThis fraud, prosecutors alleged, was a massive scheme in which a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d\u2014that included corrupt Russian government officials\u2014cheated the country\u2019s taxpayers. The alleged fraudsters stole the \u201ccorporate identities\u201d of three businesses that were owned by a foreign investment fund, made up bogus debts against these stolen businesses, and then claimed tax refund \u201con the basis of those false corporate liabilities,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nMagnitsky had uncovered this fraud. He was subsequently arrested, imprisoned without trial, and left without treatment to die after a beating.\n\nU.S. prosecutors in March 2014 asked the Russian government for records related to the fraud, including bank documents that would detail the flow of dirty money, under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).\n\nThat August, Russian officials answered the MLAT request but sent U.S. prosecutors a government report from the Prosecutor General\u2019s office rather than the documents.\n\nThis Russian MLAT Response contained \u201c supposed investigative findings purportedly from a Russian government investigation\u201d which claimed to clear all Russian government officials of involvement in this fraud,\u201d U.S. prosecutors said.\n\nPrevezon in November 2015 tried to dissuade a judge from determining that fraud had taken place, also claiming that Russian government officials weren\u2019t involved in any alleged wrongdoing.\n\nVeselnitskaya\u2019s declaration, which included the MLAT response, not only claimed it was \u201cexculpatory evidence\u201d bolstering Prevezon\u2019s claims of innocence\u2014she also said she had \u201c gone to great lengths to obtain a copy of it.\u201d\n\nThe Russian lawyer maintained not only that she tried getting a copy from Russia\u2019s Prosecutor General and had been denied\u2014but that she pursued an action in a Russian court to compel Russian prosecutors\u2019 cooperation.\n\nThe Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office charges that Veselnitskaya\u2019s claim of Russian prosecutors\u2019 resistance is untrue.\n\nEmails from an account Veselnitskaya used show that she \u201csecretly worked with a senior Russian prosecutor to help draft the Russian MLAT Response.\u201d She sent \u201cmultiple drafts\u201d of her declaration to the personal email address of a Russian prosecutor in the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. The Russian prosecutor made numerous edits and insertions to the Russian MLAT Response, U.S. prosecutors charge.\n\nThis same Russian prosecutor also sent Veselnetskaya a draft complaint against the Prosecutor General to show her purported efforts in obtaining MLAT info.\n\n\u201cSuch a formal complaint would falsely make it appear\u2014consistent with the Veselnitskaya Declaration\u2014that Veselnitskaya was only able to obtain the Russian MLAT Response through formal legal means and was not a party to its very drafting,\u201d U.S. prosecutors claim.\n\nIn Veselnetskaya\u2019s court filing, she didn\u2019t disclose any information about the Russian prosecutors\u2019 involvement, not that she helped pen the MLAT response.\n\nVeselnitskaya, 43, has not been detained by U.S. authorities and is believed to be in Russia.\n\nPutin\u2019s personal animosity to Browder is intense; he even singled him out for criticism during the historic joint press conference with President Trump after the Helsinki summit.\n\nBrowder took up his cause and pledged to track down the stolen money wherever in the world it had been hidden and hold the perpetrators of the fraud, death, and cover-up to account.\n\nIn 2012, President Obama signed the Magnitsky act into law in the U.S. sanctioning senior Russian officials for their roles in the crime. The Magnitsky act has since been expanded in the U.S. and beyond to go after corrupt Russian officials and oligarchs including some of Putin\u2019s closest associates.\n\nLawyers for Prevezon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "The attorney is most famous for her role in a 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Don Jr., Kushner, and Manafort.", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis", "Nico Hines", "London Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1546963389/190108-Natalia-Veselnitskaya-tease_vljrkn", "published_at": "2019-01-08"}
