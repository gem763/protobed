There may be only a few hundred people in the country who think Munchetty is wrong.\n\n'But it is not the BBC's job to ignore them or their views, abhorrent though they may be.'\n\nNaga Munchetty was found by the BBC to have breached editorial guidelines when she reacted to Trump's 'go home' remarks to four Congresswomen on BBC Breakfast on July 17 (pictured: Ms Munchetty alongside co-host Dan Walker)\n\nHis comments came as Ofcom said it would look into the BBC's 'lack of transparency' over the row 'as a matter of urgency'.\n\nThe body will examine the BBC's failure to publish its reasoning for its initial decision that Munchetty had breached editorial guidelines when she remarked on comments made by the US President telling female Democrats to 'go back' to where they came from.\n\nThe ruling was overturned last week by Lord Tony Hall following a large public backlash and Ofcom will also look at the Director-General's intervention.\n\nThe BBC's executive complaints unit (ECU) last month ruled that BBC Breakfast presenter Munchetty had breached editorial guidelines with her comments on the US president.\n\nHowever, Ofcom has said that, following its own assessment, the July 17 broadcast of BBC Breakfast was in fact impartial, in accordance with the Broadcasting Code, and that an investigation was not justifiable.\n\nThe media regulator said it has received 18 complaints, the majority of which related to the fact the ECU initially partially upheld a complaint against Munchetty.\n\nKevin Bakhurst, Ofcom's group director for content and media policy, said: 'Due impartiality rules are vital for maintaining high levels of trust in broadcast news.\n\n'We took into account the format of the BBC Breakfast programme and the nature of the presenters' exchange. Our assessment is that it would not breach our broadcasting rules and does not warrant investigation.'\n\nMr Clarkson accused director general Lord Hall of undermining his standards chief David Jordan, (pictured on September 16) who he said had always been 'fair'\n\nMr Bakhurst added: 'More widely, we have serious concerns around the transparency of the BBC's complaints process, which must command the confidence of the public.\n\n'We'll be requiring the BBC to be more transparent about its processes and compliance findings as a matter of urgency.'\n\nOfcom said that the exchange between Munchetty and her co-host Dan Walker was not considered to have breached due impartiality rules.\n\nThe watchdog has published correspondence between the BBC and itself following what they said was a 'lack of transparency' from the broadcaster.\n\nA BBC spokeswoman said: 'We note Ofcom's finding and the fact they agree with the Director-General's decision.'", "description": "The former Top Gear host accused BBC director general Lord Hall of undermining his standards chief David Jordan, who he said had always been 'fair'.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/06/19428568-0-image-a-10_1570514093748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
