The Astros came to life at Nationals Park in Washington D.C., outscoring the Nationals 19-3 to erase a 2-0 deficit in the World Series and head back to Minute Maid Park with a 3-2 series lead in advance of Game 6 on Tuesday.\n\nOn the ropes as recently as last Thursday, the Astros came out punching once the series switched venues and seized momentum almost as quickly as they surrendered it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint one thing, but I love our feel for the moment and feel for this team,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cEverybody talks about culture and chemistry, and when you have it, you love it. When you see it on the other side, you\u2019re envious of it. And we just have a way of playing today.\u201d\n\nHouston will turn to veteran right-hander Justin Verlander (1-3, 4.15 ERA this postseason) to close out the Nationals and secure the Astros\u2019 second championship in three seasons. Verlander will oppose Nationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg (4-0, 1.93 ERA), with the two combatants from Game 2 striving to gain an edge against lineups familiar with their repertoires.\n\n\u201cYeah, it becomes more difficult,\u201d Verlander said of facing a team twice in one series. \u201cI think there\u2019s adjustments both ways. But I think those opposing guys, once they\u2019ve seen you three, four at-bats, it\u2019s a little bit easier for them to make adjustments, and having seen your off-speed stuff and tracked it. You just need to execute a little bit better.\u201d\n\nStrasburg added: \u201cReally, it comes down to execution of pitches. Their approaches might change a little bit, but the important thing is to go out there and pound away and trust your stuff.\u201d\n\nFor Verlander, a surprising 0-5 with a 5.73 ERA over six career World Series starts, the aim for Game 6 is simple. He has scuffled settling into starts this postseason, allowing a total of nine first-inning runs to the Tampa Bay Rays in Game 4 of the American League Division Series, the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the AL Championship Series and Washington last Wednesday.\n\nStrasburg, meanwhile, faces the challenge of maintaining his stuff through what will be the final start of an extended campaign. He has logged a career-high 237 innings this season, 17 more than his previous high of 220 in 2014 when he paced the National League with 242 strikeouts.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s definitely uncharted territory,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just trying to continue to do what I\u2019ve tried to do all year, is just take it one day at a time and just listen to the body.\u201d\n\nWashington plans to keep doing what worked prior to the Astros regaining their championship form. The Nationals had won eight consecutive postseason games before falling in Game 3. They went from upstarts to juggernauts and now, down in the series, are seeking past magic.\n\n\u201cYou know what, I honestly think that our guys \u2014 they just come out and play,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even think about any game. You listen to them now when we walked in, and they\u2019re saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to go to Houston and win that first game and get to Game 7.\u2019\n\n\u201cI told them the focus is Game 6. We\u2019ve got Stephen Strasburg on the mound. I like our chances, you know, keeps us in the ball game. Who knows what can happen?\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "HOUSTON -- It required only one weekend for the Astros to reclaim their identity, to rediscover the elements that paved the way to their 107-win season and status as World Series favorites.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445997513&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1NV-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
