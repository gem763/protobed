In 1,125 counties, Mr. Clinton won or lost by a margin of less than 10 percentage points.\n\nIn 2016, by contrast, Mr. Trump won or lost by a single-digit margin in only 310 counties\u2014even though the national popular vote was much closer than in 1996.\n\nIn other words, competitive races have become scarce. Voters now live in two camps, a metropolitan America that leans Democratic, and regions beyond the nation\u2019s big metro areas that lean Republican. The country\u2019s political map is painted in red and blue, with little purple.\n\nTwenty years ago, many cities produced far closer election results than today. The 1996 election produced a one-point race in the county that\u2019s home to San Diego, for example, whereas Mr. Trump lost it by 20 points.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How have you seen the voting behaviors in your town change? Join the conversation below.\n\nMany rural areas show the same trend: Dodge County, Wis., for example, produced a one-point race in 1996, whereas Mr. Trump won it by close to 30 points. In Mineral County, Colo., Mr. Clinton won by 3 percentage points in 1996, while Mr. Trump won it by 16.\n\nWhile Reform Party candidate Ross Perot may have had an effect on the results in 1996, it was likely to be small. Mr. Clinton defeated Republican Sen. Bob Dole that year by 8.5 percentage points, despite Mr. Perot\u2019s presence in the race.\n\nWrite to Dante Chinni at Dante.Chinni@wsj.com and Aaron Zitner at Aaron.Zitner@dowjones.com", "description": "For a stark illustration of how the political center is disappearing from American politics, compare President Bill Clinton\u2019s re-election in 1996 with Donald Trump\u2019s victory 20 years later.", "authors": ["Dante Chinni", "Aaron Zitner", "Brian Mcgill", "Aaron.Zitner Wsj.Com", "Brian.Mcgill Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109016/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
