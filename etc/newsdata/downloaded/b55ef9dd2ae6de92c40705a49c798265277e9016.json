(Reuters photo: Shannon Stapleton)\n\nFade In: int. office \u2014 day\n\nKellyanne enters in a rush. She puts her things down, takes off her coat, shuts the door behind her \u2014 doesn\u2019t notice that her desk chair is facing away. It swivels to reveal President Trump.\n\nPresident Trump: Hey, hey.\n\nKellyanne jumps, startled.\n\nKellyanne: Oh my God! Don\u2019t do that! Dammit! (BEAT) I mean, Mr. President, sorry, excuse me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump: (waves it off) No prob, K.A. But keep your voice down. I\u2019m in the middle of a pretty amazing plan if I do say so myself, and as you know, I do say so.\n\nKellyanne: Mr. President, I thought we agreed that you weren\u2019t going to have any more amazing plans \u2014\n\nPresident Trump: Couldn\u2019t resist this one! Here\u2019s the thing. Whistleblower. Bad. It\u2019s a bad thing, K.A., and who\u2019s going to put a stop to this? Who is going to step up and protect our administration?\n\nKellyanne: Well, I \u2014\n\nPresident Trump: Me! That\u2019s who. So get this. I\u2019ve picked a bunch of likely suspects and this morning I told each of them I was about to do something really crazy \u2014\n\nKellyanne: I don\u2019t like where this is going.\n\nPresident Trump: And whichever thing finds its way into the lamestream fake news, that\u2019s how I\u2019ll know who the whistleblowing traitor is, and then we can, you know, do the thing that\u2019s in the big document that everyone is \u2014 what\u2019s that thing?\n\nKellyanne: I don\u2019t \u2014\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump: (snapping fingers) The Constitution! The thing with the part about taking traitors and, what is it again? Tossing them into a sack and throwing them off the top of the building?\n\nKellyanne: Sir, that\u2019s not in the Constitution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump: I know that, K.A. It\u2019s what you call a \u201cfor instance.\u201d Not a detail guy.\n\nKellyanne: Sir, let me get this straight. Did you say you told different people in the administration different outlandish things in order to smoke out the whistleblower?\n\nPresident Trump: Catching on, good.\n\nKellyanne: That\u2019s actually . . . I mean, that\u2019s kind of . . . I mean it\u2019s actually rather clever.\n\nPresident Trump: Gotta be honest, K.A. You sound really surprised and that hurts.\n\nKellyanne: I\u2019m sorry, sir. It\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t expect, I mean, it\u2019s brilliant and, of course, you\u2019re brilliant, so I don\u2019t know why I was caught off guard, I mean, you\u2019re a genius and this is the kind of thing \u2014\n\nPresident Trump: Put a sock in it, Kellyanne! I\u2019m pulling your leg. I got the idea from an old Murder, She Wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKellyanne: (relieved) Oh! Oh, wow! So that\u2019s why I got so many calls this morning about the crazy idea of letting Turkey attack the Kurds. That was all part of the plan!\n\nPresident Trump: No, that\u2019s a real thing.\n\nKellyanne: What about the reports that you want to put a moat around our southern border and fill it with alligators?\n\nPresident Trump: Real thing.\n\nKellyanne: And what about replacing the entire National Security Council with Fox and Friends?\n\nPresident Trump / Kellyanne: (simultaneously) Real thing.\n\nKellyanne: Yeah, shoulda known.\n\nPresident Trump: Well, if you want me to spoil the surprise, I wrote it all down here \u2014\n\nHe hands Kellyanne a notepad with black Sharpie markings on it.\n\nPresident Trump: (cont\u2019d) Just keep an eye on the news and when the folks at MSNBC go nuts over some new quote unquote thing, just check the chart here and see who I told that to, and then we can start heating up the cauldron for the public boiling \u2014\n\nKellyanne: Sir, that\u2019s not \u2014\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump: It\u2019s a for-instance, K.A. Try to keep up.\n\nKellyanne\u2019s phone begins to buzz. She checks it.\n\nKellyanne: Sir, the AP is reporting that you\u2019ve ordered the Norwegian government to hand over the little environmentalist girl, Greta Thunberg.\n\nPresident Trump: Yes! Yes! Got him! Just check the list! Who did I tell that to?\n\nKellyanne: (reading list) I guess it\u2019s here, under \u201cnutty pigtail girl who was mean to me\u201d?\n\nPresident Trump: Yeah, couldn\u2019t remember her name. So who did I tell that to?\n\nKellyanne: (reading list) Um . . . Donald Jr.\n\nPresident Trump: What?\n\nKellyanne\u2019s phone buzzes again.\n\nKellyanne: The New York Times just reported that you\u2019re going to ask Vice President Pence to confess to masterminding the whole Ukraine-Biden business.\n\nPresident Trump: Do I want to know who I told that to?\n\nKellyanne: (reading list) I don\u2019t think so, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: Was it Jared?\n\nKellyanne: (shaking her head) Ivanka.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(BEAT) I\u2019m sorry, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: I can\u2019t believe it! Betrayed by my own family! This really hurts, Kellyanne.\n\nKellyanne\u2019s phone buzzes again.\n\nKellyanne: CNN is reporting that you have told different people outlandish things in order to smoke out the whistleblower.\n\nPresident Trump: What? WHAT? But the only person I told that to was you! Kellyanne! Are you the whistleblower?\n\nKellyanne: Sir, I\u2019ve been right here this whole time.\n\nPresident Trump: Am I the whistleblower?\n\nKellyanne: I don\u2019t think so, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: Well, it\u2019s either you or me because the only other person who knows about this plan is Rudy.\n\nKellyanne: Rudy Giuliani?\n\nPresident Trump: (shrugs) The man watches a lot of Murder, She Wrote.\n\nKellyanne and President Trump look at each other for a moment.\n\nFade Out.", "description": "Episode 211: \u2018Blow the Whistle\u2019", "authors": ["Rob Long", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Robert Verbruggen", "Jay Nordlinger", "Katherine Timpf", "Douglas Murray", "John Mccormack", "Charles C.
