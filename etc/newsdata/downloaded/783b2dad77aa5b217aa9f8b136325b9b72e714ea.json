I think we had a good phone call. It was normal and we spoke about many things,\" Zelensky said. \"You read it [the call transcript]. Nobody pushed.\"\n\nAs a reminder, this is what was said during a call the two leaders had in July.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General [Barr] would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...It sounds horrible to me,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case,\" Zelensky replied.\n\nYesterday House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched an \"impeachment inquiry\" based on the false and anonymous allegation President Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless the Biden's were investigated.", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:29:09PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/268/8423a90f-e5d4-44b4-bb14-674e0692cc30.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
