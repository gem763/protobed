They include the media mogul Nabil Karoui, who is in prison on corruption charges that he denies, the prime minister, Youssef Chahed, and Abdelfattah Mourou, who heads a first-time bid on behalf of his Islamist inspired Ennahda party.\n\nSeventy thousand police officers and 30,000-plus troops have been deployed around a country where there has been sporadic, but sometimes serious, terrorist attacks in recent years.\n\nIn La Marsa, the wealthy seaside neighbourhood of Tunis, early voting on Sunday morning was busy. As the prime minister emerged from a polling station surrounded by a scrum of photographers, Lofti Jalassi, 52, followed with his son. Like many Tunisians during the campaign, he complained about the trajectory of the country since the revolution that launched the Arab spring in 2011.\n\n\u201cThe last eight years have seen the political parties just running to keep their seats and power,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been chasing corruption while crime and unemployment has been going up and values declining.\u201d\n\nMaha Dakhlaouy, a 25-year old judge, was more optimistic. She cited freedom of speech, huge steps forward for women\u2019s rights and the choice of candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary the choice of candidates we have,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cYes, the last eight years have been worse than people expected, but not as bad as they were before [during the dictatorship of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali].\n\n\u201cIn the end I thought for a long time about what was the most important issue. And for me that was integrity. So I voted for Mohammed Abou, who is a lawyer who has fought against corruption.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tunisian soldiers stand guard outside a polling station in Tunis.

The shooting. I remember people trying to escape. I remember the dead and the bodies. It changed everything for us. We used to work six months of the year, now it is only for two months.\u201d\n\nFor Ben Saad, the impact of the attack \u2013 one of two to target tourists in Tunisia that year \u2013 is part of a bigger crisis in the country \u2013 an economic and political one that he is uncertain will be resolved by either Sunday\u2019s voting in presidential elections or the parliamentary elections that are due to follow.\n\n\u201cNothing is good. We don\u2019t like the political and economic situation. Everything is getting more expensive.\u201d\n\nLike the rest of the country, says Ben Saad, he was full of hope eight years ago when Tunisia\u2019s revolution occurred, triggering the Arab spring and the fall of its Ben Ali.\n\n\u201cI was optimistic, like everyone else in 2011. But then [the moderate Islamist party] Ennahda came to govern the country. They took a lot of money. They let out a lot of prisoners and shut their eyes to illegal immigration. Four people who used to work with me are in Italy now. Looking at the situation now I\u2019m also thinking of leaving the country.\u201d\n\nBeyond Sousse, in the villages and towns of the coastal hinterland, the mood is even bleaker. In the small bustling town of Sidi El Heni, Sufian Ben Youssef, who is unemployed, and his friend Ahmad Ben Moussa, 26, who runs his own small import-export business, are drinking coffee in a cafe as other patrons play noisy games of rummy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to vote,\u201d says Ben Youssef emphatically. \u201cHardly any of the youth here is registered to vote. People don\u2019t care and unemployment and the economic crisis are the main reasons. I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d interrupts Ben Moussa. \u201cWe have to have hope and want to improve the situation. We need to find the right person to fix it.\u201d\n\nWhere the men agree is that the new class of politicians that emerged following the long Ben Ali era have let Tunisians down. \u201cThey didn\u2019t realise any of the promises they made to us,\u201d says Ben Moussa. \u201cThe unemployment and the economic crisis has got even worse. It\u2019s all been lies!\u201d\n\nIt is a feeling of disillusion that has inspired something unthinkable even four years ago: a mounting sense of nostalgia for the days of Tunisia\u2019s former strong man if not for Ben Ali himself.\n\nThe political analyst Oussama Hlel believes that the current round of elections represents an important moment for Tunisia.\n\n\u201cWe are at a crossroads and are being asked to choose between two paths: whether we want to continue with the process launched by the revolution or whether to change our constitutional arrangements which some candidates are talking about.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Hlel notes a new wave of populism in the language of many of the campaigns in response to a growing disillusion with many of the parties that have emerged since the 2011 revolution.\n\nThat in turn has been driven by a widespread disappointment with the last coalition government that united different factions of the two winning parties of the 2014 election: the secular and disintegrating Nidaa Tounes party and the Islamists Ennahda.\n\nThe disappointment among voters has not, however, led to disengagement. \u201cOn the evidence of the public opinion research we do we have found Tunisians are more determined to vote than ever,\u201d said Les Campbell, one of the joint heads of the US IRI/NDI election observation mission.\n\nOn Tunis\u2019s Avenue Habib Bourguiba, the broad boulevard that was at the centre of 2011\u2019s mass demonstrations that toppled the Ben Ali regime, Afifa Ouerghi, 53, was discussing the country\u2019s political trajectory with her sister Soumaya.\n\nAn English teacher from one of the city\u2019s northern suburbs, Afifa reflects the same uncertainty as those out in the countryside. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll vote. You have to. But the country is unstable and its future is not clear.\u201d\n\nReferring to the growing nostalgia for the Ben Ali era, she is less keen on the comparison although she would like to see a stronger leader either in the president\u2019s palace or as prime minister.\n\n\u201cThere is some nostalgia but I don\u2019t feel it. It\u2019s not better, it\u2019s just different. We got rid of one kind of corruption to face another one.\u201d", "description": "The economic crisis and security fears have dominated the presidential campaign", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a8cfdb32faa0ebc7d1dfedd8c3c06db3f9aedb7/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da1a339214b9bb6e1bbc07ce77278f64", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
