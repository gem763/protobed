hit the activists with metal poles, and strangled them.\n\nAfter the police and the activists left, the farmers reportedly began a high-speed chase down a motorway, allegedly shooting out the windows of a car in which Mia was travelling in, leaving her with blood pouring down her face, a video shows.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Mia denied there was any truth to reports so many animals had died in relation to the group\u2019s actions.\n\nShe said: \"This is false information with no evidence to back it up. We were inside that farm for less than five minutes and we only touched the rabbits who we rescued, who are all doing fine now, despite being very sick when rescued due to the filthy living conditions of that farm.\n\n\u201cWe did not leave any babies without their mothers as we only rescued young ones. We had a professional vet on site with us the whole time. I would like to see the official documentation, vet report and post mortem of any of these claims since I strongly believe that if any of the mothers were \u2018forced to have abortions\u2019 (as the farm alleged), then it was definitely due to the horrific conditions they were already living in when we arrived, that thanks to us, have now been exposed.\n\n\u201cWe have videos of a bunch of dead rabbits left to rot inside the farm and in the bin outside, who were already there when we got there.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This industry has deceived the public for far too long.\u201d\n\nWriting about the farmers\u2019 actions on Instagram, she said: \u201cThe police came and told us to leave peacefully, which we did. After we left the farmers chased us down the motorway at 200kph for an hour.\u201d\n\nThe activists then also called the police and were reportedly given an escort as they continued their journey, but when the police left them, the farmers reportedly caught up \u201ccame alongside and shot at us\u201d, the activist said.\n\nIn her video, she says, in an English accent: \u201cI\u2019m covered in blood. This is what the farmers have done. They shot through our window and chased us down the motorway. Oh my god, I\u2019m literally covered in blood.\u201d\n\nWriting afterwards she said: \u201cThe window exploded in my face and there was a lot of blood from all the glass. We\u2019re currently at the hospital and waiting to go to the police station to report this crime.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe most important thing is that the non-human animals are safe. They are far from that hell hole.\u201d\n\nAnother activist who was on the raid and is described as a vet, documented the state of one of the rabbits they stole from the farm.\n\n\u201cThe female rabbit \u201cwas dehydrated, hungry and was uncontrollably [running in circles] as a result of a preventative disease. A direct result of this violent and exploitative industry.\n\n\u201cImmediate treatment and care will ensure her survival, as well as her fighting spirit to live especially now she is free. She began to improve quickly and is receiving all the treatment needed to make a full recovery.\u201d\n\nThe owner of the farm also described himself as a victim of assault at the hands of the activists on Catalunya Radio.\n\nThe activists also posted links to videos made by animal rights activists Animal Equality, which has investigated conditions on several Spanish rabbit farms over two years and filmed brutal and inhumane conditions and treatment, with high rates of mortality, disease and sickness.", "description": "Vegan activists who broke into a farm in Spain and rescued 16 rabbits, before allegedly being \u201cshot at\u201d by farmers, may have inadvertently led to the deaths of around 100 more animals - according to vets working at the farm.
