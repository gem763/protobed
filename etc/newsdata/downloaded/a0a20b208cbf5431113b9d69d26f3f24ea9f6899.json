Boxing is my life. This is the only thing that I know how to do.\n\n'Everyone has a dream, but it's our job to fulfill them. With hard work, dedication and sacrifice, anything is possible.'\n\nJoshua has also been making plans to combat Ruiz's frame, with footage appearing to show him sparring 'chubby' fighters, including American heavyweight Timothy Moten, at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield.", "description": "Andy Ruiz Jr has revealed he wants to be 10lbs lighter before his rematch with Anthony Joshua, which is due to take place in Saudi Arabia on December 7.", "authors": ["Kishan Vaghela For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/14/19956400-0-image-a-40_1571578081384.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
