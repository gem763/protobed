And an official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said, \u201cIf the pest damage turns out to be insignificant, the amount of purchases may not change much.\u201d\n\nFeed maker Feedone Co. already relies mostly on corn imports, a spokeswoman said, so losses to the domestic crop wouldn\u2019t change its demand for American corn.\n\n\u201cIf Trump thinks he\u2019s going to deplete the stocks of stored-up U.S. corn and rescue the U.S. farmer in the process, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d said James Schoff, a senior fellow in the Asia Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nCorn futures prices have plunged this summer, dropping 22% on the Chicago Board of Trade since July 12, partly because of the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing. Although China has never been a large corn buyer, its dramatic reduction in purchases of U.S. soybeans over the past year persuaded many farmers to switch soybean acreage to corn. The predictable result: too much corn.\n\nJapan, long a major importer of American agricultural goods, is the second-largest buyer of U.S. corn after Mexico, relying on it for about 95% of its imports of field corn used for feed.\n\nBut its total annual corn imports come to only about 11 million metric tons\u2014so even a substantial bump wouldn\u2019t make much of a dent in U.S. corn stocks, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture last month estimated would end the season at about 60 million metric tons. That would be an increase of about 10% from the end of last season.\n\nMeeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Aug. 25 at a Group of Seven summit in France, President Trump said the Japanese corn purchases would total \u201chundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d Alluding to excess U.S. supplies, Mr. Trump said Japan is \u201cgoing to be buying all of that corn.\u201d\n\nMr. Abe, sitting alongside, confirmed the deal and said Japan was suffering from an infestation that called for accelerated corn imports.\n\nThe U.S. has produced no additional details. The White House and office of the U.S. Trade Representative didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe corn purchases were announced at the same time as a broader deal in which Tokyo agreed to reduce tariffs on U.S. agricultural products such as pork and beef and Washington agreed not to raise tariffs on Japanese cars. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened higher tariffs to narrow a nearly $70 billion trade deficit with Japan.\n\nFarm groups in the U.S., including the National Corn Growers Association and the American Farm Bureau Federation, have welcomed the U.S.-Japan deal.\n\nWithout it, U.S. farmers have been at a disadvantage to competitors inside the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement signed last year by Japan and 10 other countries\u2014not including the U.S., which withdrew in 2017 after helping negotiate the pact. Countries trading within the TPP enjoy lower tariffs.\n\nFor its part, Tokyo is hoping to avoid tariffs that Washington has threatened on imports of automobiles and auto parts, which would fall heavily on Japan\u2019s auto makers. The country is also seeking lower U.S. tariffs on industrial goods.\n\n\u201cAbe would really like to put the trade issue behind him,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, managing director of the Asia Society\u2019s Washington office and a former trade diplomat. \u201cAnd Trump wants to get something for U.S. farmers at a time that farmers are hurting.\u201d\n\nJapan is \u2018going to be buying all of that corn,\u2019 President Trump said, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed Tokyo would help.

Mr. Trump has described what he said were agreements by Mexico and China to purchase more agricultural products, but they didn\u2019t materialize. Nor did a humanitarian relief program, proposed by the president on Twitter, that would buy U.S. crops and ship them to poor countries.\n\nNow Japan\u2019s trade deal risks being bundled with a corn-purchase program that may not happen on a large scale.\n\n\u201cThe corn deal is a distraction from the core issue,\u201d said Mr. Schoff of the Carnegie Institute.\n\nAt the root of Japan\u2019s corn issue is a moth. Damage from the fall armyworm, the moth\u2019s caterpillar stage, was first observed in southern Japan in July. By Sept. 6 it had spread to 17 of the nation\u2019s 47 prefectures, according to the agriculture ministry.\n\nMr. Abe\u2019s top aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, said \u201cdamage from insects is spreading very fast.\u201d However, it has been observed mainly in southern regions that account for only a small portion of corn production. The very hungry caterpillars haven\u2019t made it to the northern island of Hokkaido, which grows about 60% of Japan\u2019s field corn.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a serious problem at all,\u201d said Nobuhiro Suzuki, a professor of agriculture at Tokyo University. Prof. Suzuki said Japan might end up buying the extra corn to avoid Mr. Trump\u2019s ire, and figure out later what to do with it\u2014such as sending it to Africa or burning it as biofuel.\n\n\u201cJapan has been forced into a position where it has to accommodate every request, because it is threatened by a potential 25% tariff on cars,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com and Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com", "description": "With U.S. corn farmers hammered by the trade war with China, President Trump has said Japan will buy enough to pick up the slack.
