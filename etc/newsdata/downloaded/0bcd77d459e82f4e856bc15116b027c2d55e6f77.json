Shanghai also added 0.3 percent and Tokyo went into the break 0.4 percent higher.\n\n- 'Dangerous game' -\n\nSydney gained 0.7 percent as investors grow optimistic the Australian central bank will cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting, while Seoul and Taipei added 0.2 percent. Singapore edged up 0.1 percent and Wellington put on 0.4 percent.\n\nHowever, traders are on edge in case of further attacks on Saudi Arabia at the weekend following the devastating strikes that crippled two of its biggest oil plants on Saturday and sent the price of crude soaring.\n\nBoth main contracts stabilised this week after the initial shock but there are worries of a possible conflict after the US and Saudi Arabia pointed the finger at Iran and said they were considering their response.\n\nAdding to concerns, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned Thursday that any military strike on the country could lead to \"all-out war\".\n\n\"It is hard to see oil markets wanting to sell crude heavily ahead of the weekend and the event risk that entails,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior markets analyst at OANDA.\n\n\"In fact, that would be a very dangerous game as the threat of more attacks from Iran or its proxies have, if anything, increased, not decreased given the enfeebled global response this week.\"\n\n- Key figures around 0230 GMT -\n\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.4 percent at 22,142.42 (break)\n\nHong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.3 at 26,563.22\n\nShanghai - Composite: UP 0.3 percent at 3,007.28\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.1052 from $1.1043 at 2030 GMT\n\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 107.93 yen from 108.03 yen\n\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.2526 from $1.2523\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 88.23 pence from 88.12 pence\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 64 cents at $58.77 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP 48 cents at $64.88 per barrel\n\nNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.2 percent at 27,094.79 (close)\n\nLondon - FTSE 100: UP 0.6 percent at 7,356.42 points (close)", "description": "Asian markets edged up Friday as investors turn their attention to the China-US trade talks, while keeping an eye on the Gulf region after last week's air strikes on Saudi oil facilities fanned geopolitical tensions.
