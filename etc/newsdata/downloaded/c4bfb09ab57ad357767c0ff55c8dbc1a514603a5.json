Getting involved, he said he told them, would open the nation to allegations that it was interfering in an American election and could be detrimental to Ukraine long-term, according to the two individuals familiar with his testimony.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVolker faced hours of questioning Thursday from members of the House committees leading an impeachment inquiry into Trump, the first of five former and current State Department officials to testify as part of the probe.\n\nIn discussing Giuliani\u2019s sources, Volker specifically mentioned former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko, a controversial figure in Ukrainian politics in part because of his battles with the country\u2019s anti-corruption bureau.\n\nAndrew Weiss, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said trusting Lutsenko was a risky move given his status as a \u201cdiscredited Ukrainian law enforcement figure.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is Ukraine Politics 101,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nKurt Volker, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, resigns\n\nVolker was named in the whistleblower complaint as the diplomat who set up a meeting between Giuliani and a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky amid Trump\u2019s effort to compel an investigation of the Bidens. House investigators asked Volker whether that pressure included withholding a leader-level meeting with Zelensky and about $400 million in military aid from the country, those familiar with the meeting said.\n\nAD\n\nVolker acknowledged, these people said, that the Trump administration had extended an invitation to Zelensky shortly after his election in the spring and that it was later withdrawn. Volker told House investigators that Trump\u2019s delay in meeting Zelensky and the decision to halt military aid deeply concerned Ukrainian officials, who view Washington as a critical ally against Russia, the people familiar with his testimony said.\n\nAD\n\nVolker said Thursday that he was never given an explanation about the aid suspension, which analysts called striking.\n\n\u201cVolker is telling us that he spent two-plus years of his life pushing a policy line on Ukraine very energetically yet, at a critical moment in that country\u2019s political life, he had little or no visibility about what the president was actually up to, the information Trump was relying on, or even what Trump was trying to accomplish,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats left the deposition arguing that Volker\u2019s testimony only further confirmed the damage Trump and Guiliani did to U.S. foreign policy on behalf of the president\u2019s political interests. Volker, they said, made clear that the Ukrainians were confused and upset by the administration\u2019s decisions to delay the diplomatic visit and stall military aid \u2014 and that they did not know how to handle the situation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI walk away very bothered by the fact that a private citizen, albeit the attorney to the president, is roaming around another country purporting to wear a semiofficial hat and explicitly trying to dig up dirt on domestic political opponents,\u201d said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.).\n\nRepublicans said that Volker\u2019s testimony fell far short of revealing the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d narrative promoted by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who as head of the House Intelligence Committee is leading the impeachment inquiry along with the heads of the Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNothing he has said supports the narrative you\u2019ve been hearing from Mr. Schiff and the Democrats \u2014 nothing,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of Trump\u2019s top allies on Capitol Hill, said after more than two hours of Volker\u2019s testimony.\n\nAD\n\nThroughout Volker\u2019s interview, Giuliani continued to tweet images of text messages he exchanged with the former special envoy, posts attempting to counter criticisms that he was conducting rogue U.S. foreign policy in his capacity as Trump\u2019s personal attorney.\n\n\u201cVolker reached out to me,\u201d Giuliani tweeted.\n\nIn advance of his appearance Thursday, Volker had turned over a number of documents to congressional staffers, including chains of text messages with Giuliani and other State Department officials, said people familiar with the documents. On Thursday, Fox News and ABC News each obtained text messages appearing to show a top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, expressing concern that the Trump administration was trying to carry out a quid pro quo. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d read the message. The exchange took place in September.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe group text included Volker and the U.S. ambassador to the E.U., Gordon Sondland, who denied that a quid pro quo was in the works, according to Fox News and ABC News. \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d Sondland said in a text. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nVolker started his job at the State Department in 2017 in an unusual part-time arrangement that allowed him to continue consulting at BGR, a powerful lobbying firm that represents Ukraine and the U.S.-based defense firm Raytheon. During his tenure, Volker advocated for the United States to send Raytheon-manufactured antitank Javelin missiles to Ukraine \u2014 a decision that made Raytheon millions of dollars. BGR has said Volker recused himself from all Ukraine-related matters in response to criticisms about conflicts of interest.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the State Department announced that it had approved the sale of 150 additional Javelin missiles to Ukraine for up to $39.2 million and notified Congress.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVolker also kept his job as executive director of the McCain Institute, an affiliation that may explain why Volker never penetrated Trump\u2019s inner circle, given the president\u2019s open disdain for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died last year.\n\nPreviously, he served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nIn late July, a day after Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, the whistleblower says, Volker and Sondland held a meeting with Zelensky and gave him advice about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s request.\n\nThe White House denies the charge of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with Ukraine and says that Trump withheld aid to Ukraine out of frustration over Europe\u2019s lack of support for Ukraine and continued problems related to corruption in the country.\n\nWhen asked whether he thought anything improper occurred on the phone call, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that everything the Trump administration has done related to Ukraine has been \u201cremarkably consistent\u201d and focused on confronting the \u201cthreat that Russia poses\u201d and rooting out \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nMike DeBonis and Dan Lamothe contributed to this report.", "description": "Kurt Volker\u2019s testimony offers the first inside account of the administration\u2019s efforts to press for an investigation of the former vice president and his son.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_WKXJe8lSbo1UHec-Ue2d9VqScE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ESQTQHF4EI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg"}
