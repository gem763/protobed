REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nThe suspected syndicate leader is Tse Chi Lop, 55, an ex-convict who formerly lived in Toronto and has moved between Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan in recent years, according to counter-narcotics officers from four countries as well as law enforcement documents reviewed by Reuters. Authorities have not publicly identified Tse as the boss of the drug trafficking group.\n\nThe syndicate he is suspected of running is known to its members as \u201cThe Company.\u201d Law enforcers also refer to it as \u201cSam Gor,\u201d or Brother Number Three in Cantonese, after one of Tse\u2019s nicknames.\n\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP), which has taken the lead in the sprawling investigation, has compiled a list of top syndicate members that identifies Tse as \u201cthe senior leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.\u201d The group, the list says, has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The list, reviewed by Reuters, does not provide specific details of the cases.\n\nA flow-chart of the syndicate in a Taiwanese law enforcement document identifies Tse as the \u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the Sam Gor syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) alert circulated among regional government agencies this year says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of the syndicate.\n\n\u201cBrother Number Three is target number one,\u201d said one AFP officer.\n\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.\n\nAccording to interviews with regional law enforcers from eight countries, as well as a review of law enforcement documents, the syndicate produces vast quantities of high-grade methamphetamine in Myanmar and trafficks the drug to countries stretching from Japan to New Zealand. The group is \u201cconservatively\u201d raking in $8 billion a year and could be earning as much as $17.7 billion annually, according to an estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\n\n\u201cTse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC, referring to Latin America\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.\u201d\n\nThe syndicate is the major factor in the fourfold increase in region-wide meth trafficking in the past five years, the UNODC says. The supply of the highly addictive drug has surged, causing the street price to plummet in many countries. In a report in July, the UN agency said the meth trade had reached \u201cunprecedented and dangerous levels,\u201d and was a \u201cdirect challenge to the public security and health of the region.\u201d\n\nTRIAD ALLIANCE\n\nThe AFP has identified 19 top syndicate leaders, four of whom are Canadian nationals, the target list shows. Other suspected leaders hail from Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam. Some have links to drug trafficking that go back decades, according to the target list and investigators from four countries, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTse has not been arrested. Counter-narcotics agents said they suspect he has long been aware he is under surveillance. So far, at least one senior member of the syndicate has been arrested, according to investigators and police documents.\n\nTse has previously been involved in drug trafficking. In the late 1990s, he was arrested and extradited from Hong Kong to the United States on charges of conspiracy to import heroin into America. He was tried in New York and in 2000 sentenced to nine years in prison, which he mostly served in the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio.\n\nThe investigation, which involves about a dozen countries, has been dubbed Operation Kungur. Counter-narcotics agencies from China, Myanmar, the United States and Thailand are also leading participants, along with Australia. Taiwan, while not a formal member, is also assisting.\n\nAt the core of the syndicate are at least five triad groups that originated in Hong Kong, Macau, China and Taiwan but which have global reach, AFP officers said. These are the 14K, Wo Shing Wo, Sun Yee On, the Big Circle Gang and the Bamboo Union.\n\nTo get its drugs to market, the Sam Gor syndicate works closely with Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Thai organized crime, and Australian motorcycle gangs, among other crime groups, according to regional anti-narcotics agents and documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\nAccording to regional police sources, the task force has gathered phone intercepts of Tse talking about his drug business, phone call logs linking him to other suspected syndicate members and surveillance footage of Tse with members of the crime group. Reuters has been briefed on this evidence but has not seen it.\n\nThe UNODC estimates that the Asia-Pacific methamphetamine trade alone was worth as much as $61.4 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $15 billion just five years earlier. Heroin trafficking was worth up to $10.3 billion in 2018, it said.\n\nThe syndicate is suspected to be the major player in both the meth and heroin markets, producing the drugs as well as the hallucinogen ketamine in super-labs in Myanmar\u2019s northeast, where ethnic armed groups control swathes of territory. Police also say the syndicate traffics MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, and cocaine sourced from Europe and Latin America respectively.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.\n\nAuthorities say the drugs are distributed via repurposed fishing vessels that traverse vast distances, hidden in containers aboard other vessels, or transported by vehicles and couriers with backpacks who walk along jungle tracks leading out of the syndicate\u2019s production hub in the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden Triangle.\n\nThe full special report, The Hunt for Asia\u2019s El Chapo, can be read here and here: here", "description": "The largest ever task force assembled to fight organized crime in Asia has identified a long-time drug trafficker, a China-born Canadian national, as the suspected kingpin of a crime syndicate that police say dominates the $70 billion-a-year Asia-Pacific drug trade.", "authors": ["Tom Allard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440710363&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D10R", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
