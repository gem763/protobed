We have survived because we know how to conduct ourselves. We don\u2019t go around trying to be aggressive when we don\u2019t have the capacity, so we use other means.\"\n\nHe said that in the past Malaysia used to send to China \"gold and silver flowers every year as a symbol of our being practically, well, subservient to them\".\n\nThis month, China and Malaysia agreed to set up a joint dialogue mechanism for the South China Sea, as ties between the countries improve. China is Malaysia's biggest trading partner.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has been overseeing a sweeping plan to refurbish its army as the country ramps up its presence in the South China Sea and around self-ruled Taiwan, rattling nerves around the region and in Washington.\n\nMahathir also said China's might was the reason Muslim-majority Malaysia did not speak out much against Beijing's alleged repression of Uighur Muslims.\n\n\"You don\u2019t just try and do something which would fail anyway, so it is better to find some other less violent ways not to antagonize China too much, because China is beneficial for us,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course it\u2019s is a big trading partner of ours and you do not want to do something that will fail, and in the process, also, we will suffer.\"\n\nThe United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in what China describes as \"vocational training centers\" to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.\n\nThe 94-year-old leader also said Malaysia's police was trying to ascertain if fugitive financier Low Taek Jho was in China. Investigators have named Low, better known as Jho Low, as a key figure in the scandal at 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), which U.S. and Malaysian prosecutors say was used to siphon out hundreds of millions of dollars.", "description": "Malaysia PM says can't provoke Beijing on South China Sea, Uighur issue", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8R0BI_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
