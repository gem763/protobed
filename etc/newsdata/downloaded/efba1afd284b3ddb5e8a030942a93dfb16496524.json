A longtime democratic socialist runs an inspiring campaign for office around popular demands for economic justice; a young organizer joins that campaign, embraces that vision of change, and runs for office herself. Four years later, the longtime democratic socialist gives it another try and the newcomer endorses the effort.\n\nThat\u2019s the short version of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201cstunning\u201d embrace of Bernie Sanders. She\u2019ll officially endorse the Vermont senator on Saturday at a rally in Queens, after telling him of her decision while Sanders recovered in a Nevada hospital.\n\nYet the decision baffled some commentators. Jane Eisner, a director at Columbia\u2019s Journalism School, tweeted: \u201cI find it fascinating that women of color overlook female and minority candidates to endorse a white guy.\u201d It was a more opaque version of MSNBC pundit Tisch Sussman opining in late September: \u201cIf you are still supporting Sanders as opposed to Warren, it\u2019s kind of showing your sexism.\u201d\n\nThose remarks tell us a lot about politics in 2019, and the world that the professional class inhabits. Today, for many liberals, the idea of inherent conflict between those with power and wealth and those deprived of it \u2013 the language of class struggle \u2013 has been thoroughly rejected. In its place, we have a glib tribalism. \u201cWomen\u201d (a majority of the world) and \u201cwomen of color\u201d (a plurality of it) are said to have a common bond based on their identity. It doesn\u2019t, apparently, matter whether you\u2019re a female executive or you\u2019re cleaning toilets at a corporate headquarters.\n\n\n\nThe small clique that runs the world is no longer identified as a \u201cruling class\u201d, their control of the economy is no longer called \u201ccapitalism\u201d but instead they\u2019re merely identified as \u201cwhite guys\u201d. Forget the fact that more than one in three Americans are \u201cwhite guys\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhite guys\u201d exploited at their workplaces, \u201cwhite guys\u201d facing declining life expediencies, \u201cwhite guys\u201d utterly ignored by political elites. \u201cWhite guys\u201d, after all, are your real enemies.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez knows: Bernie Sanders is the most progressive choice | Arwa Mahdawi Read more\n\nWhen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came to national prominence a year and a half ago, she had a narrative \u2013 an outsider, Latina bartender taking on the Democratic establishment and winning. The narrative naturally touched upon her identity, where she was from, what she dealt with going up, and her unlikely rise. Everybody, especially Americans, loves an underdog story.\n\nBut that tale was backed up by substance. Ocasio-Cortez has continued to matter, not because of who she is, but because of what she stands for. She is an open democratic socialist, she talks about prioritizing the needs of working people of all races, and she\u2019s presented bold new proposals like the Green New Deal to build a better future for them.\n\nIlhan Omar, who\u2019s also endorsing Sanders, has done much the same. For her, \u201cthe very serious function of racism is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work,\u201d and Trump\u2019s racist populism is an effort to \u201cprevent the solidarity of working people\u201d. These are not radical sentiments \u2013 they\u2019re things that any socialist or social democrat would have said throughout the last century and a half. But they absolutely befuddle a media class who can only see politics through the lens of identity.\n\n\n\nFor them, despite Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Rashida Tlaib\u2019s far longer-standing ties to Sanders and closer ideological affinities, a Warren endorsement would be more logical, because she also happens to be a woman. For them, the division in society isn\u2019t between the have and have-nots, but between members of a dominant \u201cwhite male\u201d tribe and everyone else.\n\nSuch analysis underestimates the extent to which the progressive surge that Bernie Sanders inspired is ideologically coherent, has a popular audience, and is geared toward a polarization against corporate control both inside and outside the Democratic party. As the Hill.tv host Krystal Ball puts it, this is about \u201cclass power over girl power\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s been no doubt inspiring to many to see minority women take on a prominent political role in a country that has long shut them out. But that inspiration has to be tied to tangible efforts to improve the lot of millions that will never reach such prominence. The Squad, in an important sense, represents the proper way to use identity \u2013 to bolster narratives that aren\u2019t about personal branding, but are about connecting with people and galvanizing them to struggle against oppression and exploitation on their own behalf.\n\nWhen on the phone with Sanders last week, Ocasio-Cortez told him: \u201cI have so much trust and confidence in you that you are the one who will fight the fight that I believe in. I\u2019m with you.\u201d Sanders, unlike Warren, isn\u2019t a lone technocrat doing battle against special interests. He\u2019s the leader of a movement with clear objectives and a unifying theory of change. And whenever Sanders calls it quits (be it in July, November, or after years of executive power), Ocasio-Cortez has positioned herself to be his successor.\n\nAt the very least, her bold statement on Saturday should put an end to corporate Democrats saying that they \u201clove her\u201d but hate her \u201cinterrupting\u201d, \u201cyelling\u201d, old white male mentor.", "description": "Ocasio-Cortez is endorsing Sanders on Saturday because they share a vision of working-class politics.
