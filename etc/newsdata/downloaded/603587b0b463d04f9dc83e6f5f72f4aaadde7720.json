Get up to speed fast here:\n\nWhat happened over the weekend?\n\nCoordinated strikes targeted key Saudi Arabian oil facilities early on Saturday morning, causing a dramatic escalation in tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTwo crude processing facilities were hit: Abqaiq and Khurais. Abqaiq, operated by Saudi giant Aramco, is the world's largest processing plant.\n\nThe attacks started a series of fires that took out nearly half of Saudi's oil production -- 5% of the global daily output.\n\nTwo Saudi sources familiar with the kingdom's oil operations tell CNN that restoring production to its pre-attack levels \"will take weeks, not days.\"\n\n\"This is unprecedented in scale, and impact,\" according to both sources.\n\nA senior official told CNN that 19 Saudi targets were struck in Saturday's attack, drawing on commercial satellite imagery shared with CNN.\n\nWho is responsible for the attack?\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they conducted the strikes -- using 10 drones -- in retaliation for Saudi Arabia's military campaign against the group in Yemen.\n\nA spokesman for the Houthis also said: \"We promise the Saudi regime that the next operation will be wider and more painful if the blockade and aggression continues.\"\n\nThe US has cast doubt on the Houthi statement, placing blame on the group's benefactors, Iran, instead.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo says there is \"no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\"\n\nA US official pointed to the angle at which Saudi oil facilities were attacked, the number of points of impact and other information to argue that it is unlikely the attacks were carried out from Yemen.\n\n\"You can't hit 19 targets with 10 drones like that,\" the US official said.\n\nInstead, the official suggested the attack most likely originated in southern Iraq or Iran.\n\nIran supports and arms a coalition of armed groups in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Units.\n\nIraq's government has denied that the country was used as a launching pad for the attacks.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not yet placed blame on any party for the attack.\n\nWhat has Iran said?\n\nIran has denied responsibility for the attack. The country's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif dismissed Pompeo's accusations as part of a \"max deceit\" campaign.\n\n\"Having failed at 'max pressure', @SecPompeo's turning to 'max deceit',\" Zarif wrote in a tweet. \"US & its clients are stuck in Yemen because of illusion that weapons superiority will lead to military victory.\"\n\nIn response to the US statements, a senior Revolutionary Guards commander told Iranian semi-offical news agencies that Iran was ready for \"full-fledged\" war.\n\n\"All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\" the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying\n\nHow has the US responded?\n\nUS President Donald Trump has raised the spectre of a military response to the attacks. On Sunday evening, he tweeted that the US has \"reason to believe that we know\" who is responsible for the strikes, adding that the country is \"locked and loaded depending on verification.\"\n\n\"Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\" Trump said.\n\nTrump used similar language in June when he announced he had called off an attack on Iran just as the US was \"cocked & loaded\" to strike , because he decided it would cause too many deaths to be a proportionate response to Tehran's downing of a US drone.\n\nWill fuel prices go up?\n\nOil prices have spiked after the Saudi attack , though the long-term effects on the market are less clear.\n\nBrent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose by as much as 19.5%, to $71.95 a barrel , the biggest intra-day jump since the start of the 1991 Gulf War. It later dropped by 10%.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the world's biggest oil exporter.\n\nThe US has tried to offset the effects of the kingdom's supply disruption by promising to draw on the country's emergency reserve.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump said he had ordered that oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, be used \"if needed.\"\n\nHe said he would use enough oil \"to keep the markets well-supplied.\"\n\nThe attack has exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia's energy operations, which account for over 40% of the country's GDP. It may have a long-term impact on the kingdom's desire to take the state-owned oil giant, ARAMCO, public.\n\nBut the long-term impact on global oil markets will depend on how quickly Saudi Arabia can restore operations in the damaged facilities.\n\n\"A small $2-$3 per barrel premium would emerge if the damage appears to be an issue that can be resolved quickly, and $10 if the damage to Aramco's facilities is significant,\" said Ayham Kamel, from research and consulting firm Eurasia Group.\n\nOthers told CNN Business they believe prices could jump even higher because of the amount of Saudi oil affected by the attacks.", "description": "Attacks on major oil plants in Saudi Arabia have shaken up global oil markets and dramatically escalated a confrontation between the kingdom and its regional arch-rival Iran.", "authors": ["Tamara Qiblawi"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190915180704-06-saudi-refinery-attacks-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
