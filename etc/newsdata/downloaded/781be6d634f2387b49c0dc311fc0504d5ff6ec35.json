That marked a historic nadir and was 3.6 percentage points lower than in 2013. Mayor Bill de Blasio chalked the decline up to a number of initiatives that have come out of City Hall during his tenure.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI was elected on a promise to end the Tale of Two Cities and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve spent every day of the last five years working to do,\u201d he said in a statement released Tuesday. \u201cPoverty in New York City is at historic lows. From fighting for a $15 minimum wage to guaranteeing pre-k for every child to paid safe and sick leave, we are putting more money in the hands of working families and creating a fairer city for all.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nSince 2013, there has been an incredible population turnover as millions of New Yorkers have moved in and out of the city, and millions of newcomers arrived \u2014 all while the local economy added more than 500,000 jobs, said Alex Armlovich, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. He argued that at least some of the poverty decline was caused by simple churn: low-income New Yorkers leaving and being replaced by those with more money.\n\nLast year, for example, the Census showed a population drop of more than 230,000 people. And within that astounding figure, Armlovich noted a decrease in the number of households in the lowest income bracket and an increase of households in the highest. The data doesn\u2019t say exactly who is moving where, but Armlovich said this and other clues in the Census suggest an out-migration of low-income New Yorkers who have been priced out of the housing market.\n\n\u201cThe mayor is right that poverty went down from last year,\u201d he said in an email to POLITICO. \u201cBut there are fewer poor households and more rich households in a year when the individual population fell by 230,000. Who do you think left?\u201d\n\nHowever James Parrott, director of economic and fiscal policies at The New School\u2019s Center for New York City Affairs, looked at a different table within the recently released Census data set, zeroing in on the number of households who moved in and out of the state in 2018.\n\nMost people who left were higher-income, he found. And more higher-income people moved out than in. Conversely, most arrivals were low-income. And more low-income households moved here than away. Those numbers wouldn\u2019t capture moves within New York State \u2014 and thus provide another incomplete picture of who is moving where. But Parrott argued the numbers suggest migration did not play a significant role in the poverty decline.\n\nInstead, he chalked the change up to a state policy enacted in 2016.\n\n\u201cMy informed sense is that the rise in the minimum wage is the biggest factor because it affects one-third of all New York City workers, and it has more than doubled in the past five years,\u201d he said in a written statement to POLITICO. \u201cAnd data from other sources \u2026 show unprecedented wage gains for the lowest-paid third of the workforce.\u201d\n\nThe state Legislature enacted a higher minimum wage at the urging of a coalition that included the de Blasio administration. In New York City, that has bumped minimum pay from $7.25 to $15.\n\nUniversal pre-K and paid sick leave, two of the de Blasio administration\u2019s signature policies, would not have directly translated into higher salaries for New Yorkers.\n\nStill, the mayor\u2019s office argued that the initiatives help low-income New Yorkers go back to school, for example, or seek higher-paying gigs. And when coupled with other city, state and federal policies \u2014 such as affordable housing, the Earned Income Tax Credit and SNAP benefits \u2014 more money is going into the pockets of the poor.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at all that, as well as the U.S. official measures, we are seeing similar trends of declining poverty that say to us: policy matters,\u201d Matthew Klein, executive director of the Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity, said in an interview.\n\nKlein noted that the city puts out a more detailed study of poverty every spring that takes these factors into account and looks at after-tax income. And the mayor\u2019s press office insisted that de Blasio\u2019s programs have contributed to falling poverty.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that the progressive policies of this administration, from fighting to raise the minimum wage to rent freezes to affordable housing to pre-k, are making a huge difference in the lives of low-income New Yorkers,\u201d mayoral spokesperson Laura Feyer said in a statement. \u201cTo suggest otherwise willfully ignores the human impact of what we have spent the last five years fighting for.\u201d\n\nThe NYU Furman Center, which produces detailed studies of the city and its housing stock, said more data would be helpful in getting a clearer picture of what exactly has been driving the decline.\n\n\u201cIt's certainly plausible that the city's policies have contributed to the reduction in poverty,\u201d Matt Murphy, executive director of the center said in a statement. \u201cMore rigorous study would help quantify how much of the decline might be connected to population change or other macroeconomic trends.\u201d", "description": "U.S. Census figures released last week show the city\u2019s poverty rate was 17.3 percent in 2018.", "authors": ["Joe Anuta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fa/ed/b0a458534215a1104cd4a076928b/170416-new-york-piers-gty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
