Here\u2019s a roundup of what you may have missed this week.\n\nBill Taylor testified.\n\nThe current charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires for Ukraine Bill Taylor testified before the impeachment inquiry committees on Tuesday.\n\nTaylor, a career foreign service officer, was one of three diplomats who discussed the president\u2019s extortion of Ukrainian leaders in text messages previously released by the committees. He was the lone member of the three-person group text to express disapproval of what was happening.\n\nHis 15-page opening statement walked the committees through how he came to learn that Trump was using a face-to-face meeting and congressionally approved U.S. military aid (that Trump had frozen) as a bribe to get newly elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to publicly announce investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and the 2016 election. (The proposed investigation into Biden revolved around his son Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment to the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma in 2014.)\n\nOn Sept. 1, National Security Council European Affairs Director Tim Morrison told Taylor that European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland told Zelensky\u2019s political advisor \u201cthat the security assistance money would not come until [Zelensky] committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\u201d\n\nSondland later \u201ctried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhen a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.\u201d\n\nThis metaphor indicates that Trump was extorting Zelensky to open investigations into his political rivals. The statements Taylor recounted from Sondland also contradict Sondland\u2019s prior testimony to the committees. Now congressional investigators are saying Sondland needs to come back in and clarify his testimony or potentially face charges for lying.\n\nThe Republican response remains muddled.\n\nTrump\u2019s response to Taylor\u2019s testimony was to compare the impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching\u201d and label all \u201cNever Trumper Republicans\u201d as \u201chuman scum,\u201d while implying that Taylor was among their ranks.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced a resolution to condemn the impeachment inquiry. The resolution claims that the inquiry is using an improper process by acting in secret. The committees conducting the inquiry are, in fact, operating under House rules approved in 2015 by Republicans when then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) was in charge. The non-binding resolution does not yet have 50 co-sponsors to pass.\n\nStill others squirmed with mild discomfort. \u201cThe picture coming out of it based on the reporting we\u2019ve seen is, yeah, I would say it\u2019s not a good one,\u201d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said.\n\nAnd yet more claimed not to have read Taylor\u2019s testimony or any news about it.\n\nSen @lisamurkowski hasn\u2019t read the Bill Taylor opening statement, so couldn\u2019t comment on it, so @igorbobic gave her a copy and she says she\u2019s going to now read it: pic.twitter.com/zBWoczWStX \u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 23, 2019\n\nOne group of Republicans had a different idea to ...\n\n... Occupy the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a staunch pro-Trump Republican, led a group of House Republicans in storming the House Intelligence Committee in order to disrupt the testimony of Defense Department budget official Laura Cooper on Wednesday. The stunt was approved of beforehand by Trump, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nGaetz and his band of 41 Republicans claimed to be upset about the closed door testimony process. But 13 of those who participated in Gaetz\u2019s stunt already sit on the three committees hearing the testimony and could question the witnesses freely.\n\nA number of the stunt participants also brought their cell phones into the secure committee room. That is a major no-no.\n\nThe members involved entered the room, shouted at committee Democrats and ordered pizza. Gaetz said it felt like he was in \u201c300,\u201d an action film-cum-celebration of the male form.\n\nNext up.\n\nThe tentative schedule for further testimony in front of the impeachment committees is:\n\nOct. 26: Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.\n\nOct. 28: Charles Kupperman, former deputy assistant to the president for national security affairs.\n\nOct. 31: Tim Morrison, special assistant to the president and National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia.\n\nUkraine knew about the aid freeze.\n\nOne inane point made by Trump and his defenders is that Ukraine did not know that the $391 million in U.S. military aid had been frozen by the president to be used as a bargaining chip in his extortion attempt. The argument is that Trump could not have used the aid as a bribe if Ukraine did not know that it was a bribe. But Ukraine was, in fact, aware of the aid freeze \u201cby the first week in August,\u201d according to The New York Times. This corroborates claims made in the whistleblower\u2019s report.\n\nHow extensive was the extortion attempt?\n\nThe U.S. government also \u201cwithdrew a recommendation to restore some of Ukraine\u2019s trade privileges\u201d at the height of the pressure campaign in August, according to The Washington Post. Could this have been yet another bargaining chip to get Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s 2020 adversaries?\n\nWill Bolton testify?\n\nFormer National Security Advisor John Bolton\u2019s lawyers have been in contact with impeachment investigators about the possibility of Bolton providing testimony, multiple outlets reported on Friday. Trump fired Bolton from his post in September, and Bolton has been openly critical of the president in the weeks since.\n\nWill Trump\u2019s judges side with him in court fights?\n\nTrump has made a number of wild and expansive legal arguments to prevent Congress from investigating him, including arguing that the impeachment inquiry is not legitimate. HuffPost took a look at what his most controversial Supreme Court pick has had to say about these issues over the years.\n\nImpeachment. What are we talking about here?\n\nThere are a lot of questions out there about impeachment. How does it work? What is an impeachable act? Why does impeachment take place where it does? HuffPost spoke with Philip Bobbitt, former legal counsel to the Democratic majority on the Senate Iran-Contra Committee and editor of the new edition of Charles Black\u2019s Impeachment: A Handbook, earlier this year and he answered some of these questions:\n\nOn the standards for impeachment: \u201c[The Constitution] doesn\u2019t say a president can be removed whenever two-thirds of the Senate and one-half of the House want to remove him. Instead, it says he can be removed by those votes if you find he\u2019s committed treason, or bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. So, it\u2019s not just \u2018and high crimes and misdemeanors,\u2019 it\u2019s other high [crimes and misdemeanors]. It means that you have to find that he\u2019s done something that has a deep relationship to treason and bribery. Something that is an act against the state as opposed to a common crime \u2015 shoplifting \u2015 against a person. Something that has the kind of gravity treason, bribery have. And that bring the person or his administration into contempt and disrepute.\u201d\n\nOn why the trial is in the Senate and whether impeachment is purely political: \u201cI heard a commentator say, because this is to be tried or concluded in the Senate, which is a political body and not the judiciary, it\u2019s a political and not a legal decision. That is completely wrong. There is an extensive discussion of why you have it in the Senate rather than in the Supreme Court. And the reason is that if you impeach someone and he has been tried for those crimes in an ordinary criminal suit the appeal could go to the Supreme Court. And you don\u2019t want double jeopardy to attach. You want to preserve a sense of fair play. The text says quite explicitly that the Senate is to try the case. That\u2019s the language that the Constitution uses. They take a special oath to decide the case according to law. It\u2019s presided over by the Chief Justice. It\u2019s just not an ordinary political proceeding.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This article originally said the Foreign Relations Committee is involved in the impeachment process.
