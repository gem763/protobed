Amitav Ghosh. Illustration: Intelligencer. Photo: Rosdiana Ciaravolo/Getty Images\n\nOn September 23, the United Nations opened its Climate Action Summit here in New York, three days after the Global Climate Strike, led by Greta Thunberg, swept through thousands of cities worldwide. To mark the occasion, Intelligencer is publishing \u201cState of the World,\u201d a series of in-depth interviews with climate leaders from Bill Gates to Naomi Klein and Rhiana Gunn-Wright to William Nordhaus, interrogating just how they see the precarious climate future of the planet \u2014 and just how hopeful they think we should all be about avoiding catastrophic warming. (Unfortunately, very few are hopeful.)\n\nWith his book-length essay The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, the Indian-born novelist Amitav Ghosh became something beyond the renowned author of Sea of Poppies \u2014 perhaps the most penetrating cultural critic of a new age defined by climate change and the strange, inadequate, and often self-deluding ways we process its transformations in our storytelling. His new novel, Gun Island, is a climate-change epic, one that fulfills many of the failings and missed opportunities he identified in the dizzying essay. In early September, we spoke about both books and what\u2019s changed in between them.\n\nYou wrote The Great Derangement in 2016, diagnosing a broad failure in literature, but also in our political culture, to face up to this story that we were all living in and yet unable to really process properly. Putting aside for a moment the subject of climate change itself and the changing nature of climate politics, how do you see climate storytelling having changed since you wrote that book?\n\nI think since 2016 there\u2019s been a dramatic change. And, well, your article was the inflection point. Before that, it wasn\u2019t that the studies didn\u2019t \u2014 or that people didn\u2019t \u2014 try to tell these stories. It\u2019s almost as much to do with the reception. How often did you see a book about climate fiction in The New York Times Book Review? Or The New York Review of Books. Almost never. They were just treated as marginal. I do think that Richard Powers\u2019s Overstory was a major turning point \u2014 not just because it is a great book, which it is, but because it was taken seriously by the literary mainstream.\n\nWhat do you think explains that?\n\nI think in part it\u2019s just his own personal reputation. But it\u2019s not just that. Because if you look at the response to Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s Flight Behavior, it\u2019s quite instructive. Look at the reviews, it\u2019s \u201cWhy is she doing this? It doesn\u2019t match up to the other books.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s a giant, too.\n\nBy the time The Overstory was published the ground had somewhat seriously shifted.\n\nSo what did change? Is it because the public has learned to think of this as a front-and-center story, rather than a fringe concern?\n\nGoing back to 2016 and Bernie Sanders saying right then that this is a major existential crisis, and then that voice being amplified. Extinction Rebellion has been a very major turning point. Greta Thunberg has been a very major turning point. The Sunrise movement. Just the fact that you know the activists could force the democratic party to actually agree to this CNN debate.\n\nSeven hours.\n\nSeven hours. Unbelievable. I think some sort of threshold has been crossed, but it\u2019s not just any one thing. I mean, you just look like an idiot if you just deny the reality.\n\nI think the California wildfires were a major turning point.\n\nYeah. But I don\u2019t think anybody did a very good job actually of telling the Paradise story. These perfectly ordinary people, waking up in the morning, getting their kids ready for school \u2026 And how long did it take, a half hour?\n\nHorrifying.\n\nAnd we can all identify with it.\n\nYou could imagine it being a great Paul Greengrass movie, in the line of United 93.\n\nAnother turning point was that movie about the priest.\n\nFirst Reformed.\n\nI can\u2019t say I was such a fan of it.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I had a list of books and movies to ask you about \u2014 The Overstory was one, First Reformed was another. What didn\u2019t you like about it?\n\nIt sort of brings the whole thing down to a personal crisis. I feel that that\u2019s not really a productive way of doing it. But, look, it\u2019s a minor criticism compared to how glad one feels that it\u2019s there. And that it will do something, it will be in the mainstream. It will be watched.\n\nAnd reviewed. Even more than being watched. It was written about a lot.\n\nIt was being reviewed. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s it. See, that\u2019s the thing. When these films start being taken seriously in that way, that\u2019s what marks an inflection point. The work has to be made. But then also the work has to be read and received in a certain way.\n\nIn The Great Derangement, you seem to want to see fiction that treats nature as a protagonist \u2014 that tells the story not just of a single character but of how the natural world is an active force in the lives of those characters.\n\nI think that\u2019s exactly what Overstory is. That\u2019s to me what is really so exciting about the book. Climate change is such a vast thing. It can be approached in thousands of ways. But in a literary sense this is the real challenge that it poses: How do you give voice to the nonhuman? The Overstory poses it in a very interesting way, though I think in a way he\u2019s not able to bring himself to face the true implications of what he\u2019s posing.\n\nWhat would that mean?\n\nLook, you know, an interesting thing about Richard Powers\u2019s imagination, and Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s, and for that matter Annie Proulx \u2014 I was talking to her \u2014 is that for them nature is science. In a sense it\u2019s exhausted by science.\n\nThis comes from the fact that they\u2019ve been brought up in and have always lived in a society in which science is exhaustive of nature \u2014 in which nature exists almost exclusively for scientists. So in both books, and I\u2019m a great admirer of both books, but what you can see is that they can only ventriloquize nature through the scientists. But Richard Powers takes a step further than Barbara Kingsolver. You can see him straining at the very limits of what is possible for him.\n\nI found it interesting actually to see his YouTube videos. Because he often says that you know, \u201cI\u2019ve done as much as I can. I wish I could be an animist. But I can\u2019t bring myself to cross that line.\u201d He\u2019s brought himself to vitalism. But he can\u2019t cross the border beyond that. And that\u2019s an interesting thing for me, because I\u2019m very much deep within the scientific literature, too, but I wasn\u2019t brought up in this world. I was brought up as a pantheist.\n\nAnd how would you define your worldview now?\n\nYou know, all of that comes back to me now. For me, nature has never been dead. It\u2019s filled with voices. It\u2019s filled with agency. It\u2019s filled with the uncanny. And you know, I think, actually, that is the case for most people. It\u2019s just that they can\u2019t find ways of articulating it. You think of, say, Japan, and the part that the supernatural plays in the Japanese world. They\u2019re so hypermodern, and so hypertechnological. But that aspect of the agency of the nonhuman is constantly present among them.\n\nThey\u2019re producing, on the one hand, all these horror movies, but at the same time I think they have always produced very interesting work about human agency. You must know that great book about cats. The speaking cat.\n\nThe Traveling Cat Chronicles. And in the U.S., they have to reduce all of our horror movies to fables about human action. Or it\u2019s like some retribution for some sin created in the past. Even the supernatural is reduced to the human in the sort of meaning package delivered at the end. We\u2019re really uncomfortable with the idea of a messy or truly inhuman supernatural.\n\nBut it\u2019s interesting \u2014 you pick up a newspaper in the U.S. and you look for the bestseller lists, and there are so many supernatural books. But most of all you look at the films. They\u2019re all about zombies, and vampires, and werewolves. But as you say all of those are ultimately tied to some idea of an extrahuman agency. Not a nonhuman agency.\n\nWhen I look at the climate crisis, I see it both ways. I mean, I\u2019m able to think, Of course, there are now things going on which beguile and terrify us and which are beyond our control. And I think thorough, comprehensive understanding of what\u2019s unfolding requires some perspective that puts that natural uncanny at the center. On the other hand, and this may be just the American in me, I also think it is ultimately a story about human behavior in the sense that we have kicked off these cascading changes. Some of them are now unfolding beyond our control, but from a narrative perspective I also revert back to seeing it as something that we\u2019ve created.\n\nYou know, I think it\u2019s not that simple. And that\u2019s really the point. When you wake, let\u2019s say, a sleeping tiger, you\u2019ve woken him. You haven\u2019t created him.\n\nRight.\n\nThe tiger has its agency and it\u2019s going to come after you. That\u2019s what you have to recognize. That you have no control over it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so interesting even about the science. The science is always one step short. It\u2019s almost a meme: Scientists are surprised. Scientists are puzzled. Models didn\u2019t predict. So what you can see there is that, in fact, it\u2019s like we were watching Gulliver. We were Lilliputians watching Gulliver, you know, and watching him wake up and trying to describe him in some kind of language, without recognizing the agency of Gulliver. So we haven\u2019t created it. We just, as it were, spurred something into motion, which is now violently striking back at us.\n\nYeah. I saw a headline the other day, something like, a string of unprecedented hot days strikes the American Southwest, comma, puzzling scientists. And I think, What\u2019s the puzzle?\n\nIt really is a meme. You encounter it constantly.\n\nOn the other hand, I think there is something sort of useful narratologically \u2014 to be signaling to people all the time that this is unprecedented.\n\nYeah, absolutely. But in terms of this whole idea of nonhuman agency, I think actually some of the most interesting work that\u2019s being done on that is being done in nonfiction by historians, anthropologists, and so on.\n\nWho were you thinking of?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know if you read Bathsheba Demuth\u2019s new book?\n\nNo.\n\nShe\u2019s this young historian at Brown University. She did, I must say, what was to me I think the most brilliant talk I\u2019ve ever heard. She grew up with intuits in Bering Strait. And she\u2019s a very highly trained historian, fluent in Russian. So in this talk especially she demonstrated that in the mid 19th century, when whalers started going after whales in this region, the whales responded. How intelligently they responded. How they crafted their withdrawals. But even more interesting than that is how among all hunting and gathering people, the belief is always that you don\u2019t kill the animal, the animal gives itself to you. And she actually charts it. She gives examples of how she\u2019s been with these Inuit whale hunters and one after another the bullhead whales will come out, they look at the boat, they look at the harpoonist, and then they go away. But one will stay, and it will wait until it\u2019s harpooned.\n\nOr Anna Tsing\u2019s The Mushroom at the End of the World. It\u2019s amazing. A truly heartbreaking and amazing book. But she\u2019s working with these Matsutake mushrooms \u2014 these huge complex organisms that underlie forests. She\u2019s looking at how they allow trees to communicate \u2014 the whole ensemble communicates, you know. But what is interesting is that, in Western thought, the whole idea of agency is tied to your idea of history \u2014 who has the history-making power? That\u2019s how you judge agency. And she shows you that forests have this agency.\n\nIn a certain sense, with climate change we\u2019ve given them even more power to shape our history.\n\nIf you think about it, all of this idea that emerges in the first place, out of this mechanistic theorizing, but most of all in the late 18th century \u2014 this Hegelian idealism that human beings all have spirits and we\u2019re advancing to a world where we disappear into spirit and God, divinity, and so on. How deeply rooted this idea has become in western thinking! It\u2019s something to really, truly marvel at. Because you know, you think about poetry and we\u2019re always told about the romantics and how much Wordsworth loved nature and so on. But you know the iconic poet of that age was not Wordsworth, it was Tennyson. I remember as a child in India being made to learn Tennyson. And Tennyson, in one work, he basically says, for man to move upward toward spirit, the tiger and ape must wither and die.\n\nCan you imagine? It\u2019s almost impossible for us to imagine today a poet calling for the extinction of tigers and apes.\n\nOn the other hand, our culture is sort of calling that into being collectively.\n\nExactly. And in a sense, what is this whole idea of Kurzweil\u2019s, escaping into the singularity? Essentially that idea. You escape the bonds of earth.\n\nDo you see a more sophisticated understanding of these systems evolving in the U.S., or do you think we\u2019re still largely stuck in an inappropriate and insufficient paradigm that still foregrounds the individual and the human?\n\nI think it\u2019s impossible to generalize. Because within the U.S. there are so many people who have alternate faith systems, belief systems. And we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. most of all a sort of rebellion, an inchoate rebellion against a mechanistic modern. But that inchoate rebellion has never had anywhere proper to go. They go from New Age to something else to something else. But it is a rebellion.\n\nBut those people \u2014 are they necessarily able to change attitudes toward the world? I don\u2019t know. Because if you look at the people who wield power, if you look at the industrial, intellectual, cultural elite, I think it\u2019s impossible to imagine that they can ever take on the full burden of climate change. It affects everything they know. Everything they stand for is wrong. And it\u2019s they who led us down this path.\n\nI can both see the total inadequacy of our existing elite in addressing and reckoning with this problem, and also just have a really hard time seeing that elite being toppled at the same time.\n\nIt won\u2019t be; it can\u2019t be. They\u2019re much more prepared than their adversaries. I mean, they\u2019re completely prepared. The idea that the elites deny climate change, I think it\u2019s just a complete red herring. You think someone like Peter Thiel doesn\u2019t work out climate change? Is he really quietly buying a place in New Zealand? You think Steve Bannon doesn\u2019t know about climate change? He was one of the funders of that eco project \u2026\n\nBiodome.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t kid ourselves. They know perfectly well. Does Trump not know? Why\u2019s he buying insurance? Of course he knows.\n\nOr wanting to buy Greenland.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying is that our systems are caught up in this, we have too much wealth involved in this, so let other people suffer.\n\nThat\u2019s not really climate denial.\n\nIf I were to think of a catchy phrase for this, I would say it\u2019s the climate unsayable. Because you can\u2019t, within the constraints of common public discourse today, say \u201clet them die.\u201d It\u2019s not sayable. But it is implicit.\n\nDo you think we can stop warming before we get to that point? I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s possible that we stop before 1.5 degrees.\n\nI\u2019m afraid two is optimistic. In India, the public discourse is all greenwashing, but what they\u2019re actually doing is opening up the forests, doing away with regulations, funding Adani\u2019s coal mine in Australia. And Australia is in the grip of major climate denialism, if you like.\n\nIndia\u2019s place in this story is harrowing to me, as an outsider. How do you think about it?\n\nIt\u2019s really overwhelming. I just can\u2019t bring myself to think about the worst aspects of it, really. Because it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s going to happen in the future \u2014 in fact it\u2019s happening right now. For example, the dead zones in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Literally hundreds of thousands of fisher folk have already been displaced. They\u2019ve had to abandon their traditional occupations. They\u2019re moving inland into other kinds of occupations. Some are just escaping as well.\n\nThere was a point a couple of years ago when this huge megadrought gripped Central India. When it was really at its worst, there\u2019s this region called Bundelkhand, a very water-stressed region, where close to a million people were leaving every week. The Indian parliament was in session. They held only one debate on the drought. Not even a tenth of the MPs showed up.\n\nSo I think of India as both a parable and a principle. What it shows us most effectively is the complete failure of modern government. That is to say, post-19th century institutional government. Just completely and catastrophically failing. And we see more and more evidence of this every single day. But it\u2019s not just the government. It\u2019s the entire civic culture if you like. Indian newspapers hardly pay any attention to this. Within the media it\u2019s hardly spoken of, within literature it\u2019s hardly spoken of. And the idea that this can be solved in the U.S. or in the West is an illusion. That boat has sailed. Fundamentally, this is going to be decided in Asia and in Africa. But the minister of environment in India recently said that these droughts had nothing to do with climate change. What can you say? At that point it\u2019s not even irresponsibility or anything. It just means they\u2019re living in some other alternative universe.\n\nDo you think of them like you think of Thiel and Bannon, that they understand but choose not to address it?\n\nI think a large number of them are exactly like that. The other aspect of it is just throughout Asia and Africa, the climate issue is completely subordinate to the narrative of development.\n\nWhich gives a kind of postcolonial or anticolonial cast as well.\n\nWhat they will say to you straight away is, \u201cLet them give up their cars.\u201d\n\nWell, which is a perfectly defensible position morally.\n\nBut it was not Gandhi\u2019s position. I think one always has to remember that. It was not Gandhi\u2019s position. And that such a position was possible then is a truly miraculous thing. He was able to say that I would rather that my country be poor than that we destroy the world. Today such a position would be \u2026 Any politician with such a position would be hounded to death.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your novel, Gun Island. Is it possibly true that you didn\u2019t begin writing this until after The Great Derangement?\n\nYou know, once you start thinking about these issues, they\u2019re never absent, you can\u2019t put them away, they\u2019re just there. So I guess it didn\u2019t begin necessarily as a book about all that\u2019s in it right now. But it was impossible that it wouldn\u2019t impress those things, simply because they were so urgent to me.\n\nDoes that mean you think all of your future books will be shaped by those concerns too?\n\nAbsolutely. They\u2019ll always be present. Because it\u2019s what\u2019s present.\n\nI think of this as being a book about reality. That\u2019s really what it is. It\u2019s a book about reality.\n\nBut the book also involves some kind of mythological, magic realist elements too. How did you sort of come to deploying those? Or did they seem to you just similarly a way of depicting reality?\n\nExactly that. Because I think we are living in a reality that is, in itself, fundamentally uncanny. I think it\u2019s impossible. I mean by the time I finished writing The Great Derangement, there were two or three things that were clear to me about the only ways we can write about today\u2019s world. They cannot be these individual stories of adventure. That they cannot be local. And they have to confront the aspect of the uncanny in a literary sense really. That is our great resource, the uncanny, which somehow has come down to us even through the 19th century.\n\nYou also have to remember this frog-in-the-boiling-water analogy. And one sees evidence for that all the time. Young fisherman no longer know what their grandfathers used to catch. So they think this is normal to get tiny little fish 200 miles out. They just don\u2019t remember. Farmers don\u2019t remember.\n\nI come at this from a different perspective from really thinking about it in terms of nonfiction storytelling primarily, but I just think it\u2019s both the case that we\u2019re likely to normalize and adapt beyond what today we might believe is possible. And yet at the same time, the suffering is still going to likely be so much more intense than we imagine.\n\nI think it\u2019s probably going to be much worse than we expect. That\u2019s certainly clear. And it\u2019s not just in relation to climate. You know how scientists speak about climate sensitivity? I think we should also start talking about social and political sensitivity for climate.\n\nBut the fact that 50 or 70 years from now civilization probably will not have totally collapsed, is not an argument against alarmism. In fact, it\u2019s sort of an argument for the urgency of raising the alarm now because if we wait until 2050 to be thinking about what life is going to be like in 2060 we\u2019ll have already normalized so much additional suffering that we won\u2019t be able to see the next ten years of suffering as horrifying, as it should be by any moral logic.\n\nThat is the difference between nonfiction and fiction. Fiction about something more than just telling. Because in fiction also there is consolation. It also provides meaning. It can suggest to you forms of meaning that might emerge out of you. And when you say suffering, yes you\u2019re right. But really if you think about ways in which people have thought about the world, it\u2019s only in the sort of modern era that people have come to think of suffering of being extraneous to life.", "description": "The author of \u2018The Great Derangement,\u2019 Amitav Ghosh describes just how totally we\u2019ve failed to face up to the unfolding climate crisis.", "authors": ["David Wallace-Wells"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/26/26-climate-amitav-ghosh.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
