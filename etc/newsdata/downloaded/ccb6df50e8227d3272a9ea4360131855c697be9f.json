REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nBut once Britain sends a letter to seek an extension for the divorce - as now seems likely after Johnson\u2019s failure to get the agreement approved in parliament on Saturday - there is very little chance that the other 27 members states would refuse.\n\nAfter a call between Johnson and European Council President Donald Tusk on Saturday evening, an EU official made clear, however, that the bloc would not rush.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister confirmed that the letter would be sent to Tusk today,\u201d the official said. \u201cTusk will on that basis start consulting EU leaders on how to react. This may take a few days.\u201d\n\nAn EU diplomat reinforced that message: \u201cWe won\u2019t be rushed by any request.\u201d\n\nThe bloc hopes the deal can still pass in the factious House of Commons in time to let Britain leave with a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nThe EU would, however, need to step in should that start looking unlikely if it wants to avoid a no-deal Brexit at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see them refusing,\u201d Anand Menon, director of UK in a Changing Europe and a Brexit expert, told Reuters. \u201cThey don\u2019t want no deal and they certainly don\u2019t want to be blamed for it.\u201d\n\nEU leaders might end up agreeing any new Brexit date at a hastily convened emergency summit, possibly next weekend. Their ambassadors are due to meet in Brussels on Sunday morning.\n\nBritain\u2019s parliament voted in favour on Saturday of an amendment that withheld support for Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and as a result he is obliged, by law, to request a postponement.\n\nThe EU 27 have already agreed twice to postpone Brexit from the original deadline of March 29 this year.\n\nFRUSTRATION IN BRUSSELS\n\nHowever, frustration has mounted among them over the distraction of a process that has dragged on for three-and-a-half years since Britons voted in a referendum to leave the EU.\n\nAfter the second extension they said it would be the last one, and French President Emmanuel Macron has been the most outspoken and hawkish among the 27\u2019s leaders on the issue.\n\nHis camp stresses the cost of protracted uncertainty in terms of sapping the EU\u2019s political capital and attention to face challenges from climate and migration to international crises, as well as economic cost for companies that have invested in contingency preparations for a no-deal Brexit.\n\nDespite French misgivings, the EU has repeatedly made clear it would not want to be seen pushing a member state out and that its absolute priority was to avoid any no-deal Brexit, especially one for which it would take the blame if it refused to postpone Brexit.\n\nHowever, an extension can only be granted by unanimity among the 27 and, asked whether there was any serious risk that Macron could refuse it, another EU official said: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is a chance of a deal, they will never choose no deal,\u201d said Nick Petre, spokesman for the Renew Europe group of liberals in the European Parliament that includes Macron.\n\nA ONE-MONTH DELAY?\n\nBritain\u2019s House of Commons last month passed a law demanding the government seek a delay until the end of January 2020 to avoid an abrupt split on Oct. 31, if a divorce deal is not approved by parliament by Oct. 19.\n\nIt is possible that the EU 27 will grant a \u201ctechnical extension\u201d of just one month until the end of November to keep pressure on Britain to approve the deal clinched this week.\n\n\u201cIt can still just be a technical extension, only until the end of November. And they could still get out of it if they manage to pass it before October 31,\u201d said an EU diplomat who deals with Brexit.\n\nAnother EU diplomat said the length of an extension and conditions attached would depend on the purpose behind the request.\n\n\u201cIf we still hope to be able to salvage this deal, we\u2019d be looking at shorter ones,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cThen, if we are looking at elections or second referendums, a longer one would most likely be needed. At this stage, it really depends on what happens in Britain in the coming hours.\u201d\n\nMany in Brussels believe there could be no more delays beyond mid-2020 as the bloc needs the rest of the year to prepare its new, long-term budget from 2021 and wants to know whether Britain will go on paying to the joint coffers.", "description": "European Union chiefs are so fed up of Brexit that when they clinched a new divorce deal with Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week they did not want to entertain the need to delay Britain's departure beyond Oct. 31.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442810382&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0H1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
