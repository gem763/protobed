We are told we are living in a post-Christian era, but what has replaced the Judeo-Christian moral system? What is it that can fill the spiritual void in the hearts of the individual person? And what is the system of values that can sustain human social life?\u201d\n\nBarr contends that many of society's ills are caused because of the breakdown of religion in society.\n\n\"This is not decay,\" he said. \"This is organized destruction. Secular forces and their allies have marshaled all the forces of mass communication, popular culture, the entertainment industry, and academia, in an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values.\"\n\nBarr said \"ground zero\" for the attacks is the schools, pointing to New Jersey's passage of a law requiring public schools to adopt LGBT curriculum.\n\nBarr said the Trump administration \"firmly supports\" religious freedom. Then he made a promise to those in attendance.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cI can assure you that as long as I am attorney general, the Department of Justice will be at the forefront of this effort, ready to fight for the most cherished of all American liberties: the freedom to live according to our faith,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "Attorney General William Barr took a swipe at \"militant secularists\" and their attacks on Judeo-Christian values in America,\u00a0saying \"religion has been under increasing attack\" over the past five decades.", "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
