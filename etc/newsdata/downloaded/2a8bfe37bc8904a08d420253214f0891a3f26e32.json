Oakland saw its six-game winning streak end.\n\nThe Royals\u2019 uprising came immediately after Khris Davis broke a 4-4 tie with a run-scoring single in the eighth.

Arizona responded with four in the bottom of the seventh.\n\nTigers 5, Orioles 2\n\nTyler Alexander recorded his first major league victory, and Jordy Mercer hit a two-run home run as host Detroit salvaged a four-game series split with Baltimore in a matchup between the majors\u2019 worst teams.\n\nAlexander (1-3) limited the Orioles to one run on four hits and didn\u2019t issue a walk while striking out three in six innings.
