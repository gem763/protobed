He was like, \u2018Yep, if there\u2019s an opportunity let\u2019s really go for it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks received the kickoff, and Perenara went for it. He slipped through Namibia\u2019s first line of defense on the left and carried the attack past halfway. He offloaded to wing George Bridge, and Rieko Ioane offloaded to replacement scrumhalf Brad Weber. Perenara was back up and in support when he received an outrageous behind-the-back pass from Weber 20 meters out.\n\nPerenara was too quick for Namibia hooker Obert Nortje but was slammed by flyhalf Helarius Kisting. But Perenara, falling over the touchline, had just enough momentum to twist and plant the ball beside the left corner flag.\n\n\u201cIt was a special one,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIt even got me out of my seat, not too many things do that.\u201d\n\nIt made Namibia coach Phil Davies stand up, too: \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d\n\nWhitelock, the closest New Zealand forward to the action, said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how he got it down, but it was pretty impressive.\u201d\n\nPerenara said he was screaming at Weber that he was on his left, when Weber shaped right and suddenly delivered a reverse pass around his back.\n\n\u201cPretty special,\u201d Perenara said of the pass.\n\n\u201cHaving Webby out there, and the speed he has, being able to set me up, was pretty cool. If it was the other way round, and I passed the ball to him, he probably runs around and scores under the sticks, he\u2019s that quick.\n\n\u201cI knew I had the ball down (beside the flag), I just thought my feet were out. The 10 made a good tackle on me, and I tried to get my feet in the air and I thought he had kept me down.\u201d\n\nAfter a lengthy video review, the try was given, New Zealand\u2019s 11th in a 71-9 win.\n\nAttack coach Ian Foster quipped about how it was the coaches\u2019 fault for putting two 9s - Perenara and Weber - on the field together.\n\n\u201cMayhem was always going to happen,\u201d Foster joked.\n\nSeriously, \u201cI take my hat off to them. TJ made some really good decisions (at flyhalf) and Brad (who replaced Aaron Smith) provided a little special moment with that pass. The scoreboard enabled them to express themselves the way they wanted, and they got away with it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It takes something special to move the normally stone-faced Steve Hansen in the All Blacks coaches' box.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/aptopix_japan_rugby_wcup_new_zealand_namibia_88112_c0-129-3366-2091_s1770x1032.jpg?8ab9c940a18d289097acfdc7cd7ee427e332c42a", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
