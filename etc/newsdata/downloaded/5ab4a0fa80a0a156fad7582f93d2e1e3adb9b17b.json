But, through it all, he\u2019s come out the other side relatively unscathed.\n\nLogan first rose to fame on Vine, among the likes of David Dobrik and Josh Peck. In December 2016, the platform shut down, with Logan making the move to YouTube around the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPosting a vlog every day from the end of 2016 to 2018, he quickly built up a huge audience \u2013 definitely not hindered by the skyrocketing popularity of his younger brother Jake, who started out as a Disney Channel star.\n\nIn 2017, the brothers were embroiled in a huge public feud, with the pair of them capitalising on it with their own diss tracks.\n\nDespite things getting genuinely nasty, with Logan appearing to kiss Jake\u2019s ex-girlfriend Alissa Violet, they eventually settled their differences.\n\nJapan\n\nAlthough the brothers made a name for themselves as troublemakers, it wasn\u2019t until Logan hit headline news in January 2018 that he became public enemy number one.\n\nDuring a trip to Japan, Logan visited Aokigahara, also known as Japan\u2019s suicide forest, and filmed a dead body. The video was live for 24 hours before the YouTuber deleted it from his channel following worldwide backlash.\n\nAfter a grovelling apology, he disappeared from the internet for just less than a month, before uploading a suicide prevention video and quickly resuming business as usual.\n\nReflecting on the horrific stunt and the consequences, he told Casey Neistat in a video: \u2018I forgot to be a human being in that situation and instead decided to be a content creator.\u2019\n\nLogan came under fire for his comments in Japan (Picture: YouTube)\n\nMeanwhile, Logan\u2019s best friend Mike Majlak later told Metro.co.uk he thought the stunt had been \u2018beneficial\u2019 for Logan.\n\n\u2018From a career standpoint for him, it may have caused quite a speed bump for him but, from a personal standpoint and the growth he\u2019s made\u2026It\u2019s hard for me to say I\u2019m happy it happened but I guess, looking back, I\u2019m not unhappy that it happened,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In a lot of ways, I think that happening was very beneficial for him as a person.\u2019\n\nKSI\n\nLogan\u2019s stunt and the global backlash directly led to fellow YouTuber KSI \u2013 real name Olajide \u2018JJ\u2019 Olatunji \u2013 calling on him for a boxing match after he won against Joe Weller in early 2018.\n\nThe YouTuber went on to describe the match as a \u2018redemption journey\u2019 for himself, with the pair dividing the internet down the middle and making millions from the event.\n\nWith the match ultimately ending in a draw, it was inevitable a rematch would eventually come around.\n\nKSI and Logan are set to take to the ring again in November (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Going gay for a month\u2019 and abortion comments\n\nHowever, the suicide forest stunt isn\u2019t the only reason the star has faced backlash.\n\nIn January 2019, Logan claimed he was \u2018going gay\u2019 for a month on his podcast, facing criticism from the LGBT community and organisations such as GLAAD who pointed out that being gay isn\u2019t a choice.\n\nHe later condemned his own \u2018very poor choice of words\u2019 and spoke on his podcast with LGBT activist Josh Seefried.\n\nAt his most recent public event, the London press conference ahead of his rematch with KSI, he came under fire for commenting on his opponent\u2019s history with abortion.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nDespite later branding his own comment \u2018horrific\u2019, he stood by it and argued that it didn\u2019t \u2018warrant an apology\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLogan\u2019s channel has continued to skyrocket in popularity, currently hovering around the 20 million subscriber mark.\n\nHowever, some are understandably dubious about whether he still deserves to have his platform \u2013 or embark on his so-called \u2018redemption journey\u2019 after such shocking errors in judgement.\n\nWith the star still going strong \u2013 and appearing like he\u2019s not going to slow down any time soon \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise people are questioning just how many \u2018mistakes\u2019 internet stars can get away with.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
