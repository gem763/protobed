The square was cleared of camping protesters earlier in the week.\n\nAmnesty International said the police ban was an \"unlawful restriction\" on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The police say Extinction Rebellion would be entitled to demonstrate in ways agreed in advance with the authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Stephen Addison)", "description": "About 150 mothers with babies and young children defied a police ban on climate protests to stage a \"nurse-in\" outside the London offices of Google on Wednesday, while activists launched a parallel protest at the premises of its subsidiary YouTube.
