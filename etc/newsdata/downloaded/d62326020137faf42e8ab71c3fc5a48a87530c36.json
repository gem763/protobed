We\u2019ve listened to our colleagues, including direct feedback from our Go Green Employee Resource Group, and we have met regularly on this topic with the Humane Society of the United States and other NGOs. Macy\u2019s private brands are already fur free so expanding this practice across all Macy\u2019s, Inc. is the natural next step,\u201d said Jeff Gennette, chairman and chief executive officer of Macy\u2019s, Inc. in the press release.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to partner with the Humane Society of the United States in our commitment to ending the sale of fur.
