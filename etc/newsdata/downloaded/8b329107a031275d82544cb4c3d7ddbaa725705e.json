In order to make sure they are up to speed, the Federal Guard Service (FSO in Russian) trains its drivers, including those who get to chauffeur the Russian president, at a driving school with a twist. This one\u2019s equipped with a special track that reproduces the most dangerous driving conditions. Surprisingly, it\u2019s open to ordinary members of the public too. If they want to gain an edge to their driving, they can sign up for classes with FSO instructors.\n\nAt the Federal Guard Service driving school, you can learn to drift a car on the specially-flooded track.\n\nRT correspondent Christ Helmbrecht finds out what all the fuss is about. He gets to sit in on a theory class and takes viewers on a guided tour of the track, including an underground lake with a mystery function. Chris Helmbrecht even gets to put his steering skills to the test by spinning a massive Aurus, the homegrown presidential limo, on the specially flooded training track with designer asphalt. So, can you aquaplane safely and make rainbows with your tyres?", "description": "How do Putin\u2019s drivers learn to steer safely?
