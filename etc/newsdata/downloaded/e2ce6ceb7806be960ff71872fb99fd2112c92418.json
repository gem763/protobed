And there are plenty of people (including our own Josh Constine) who think it would be foolish for publishers to trust the company again.\n\nFor one thing, there\u2019s the question of how Facebook\u2019s algorithm prioritizes different types of content, and how changes to the algorithm can be enormously damaging to publishers.\n\n\u201cWe can do a better job of working with partners to have more transparency and also lead time about what we see in the pipeline,\u201d Zuckerberg said, adding, \u201cI think stability is a big theme.\u201d So Facebook might be trying something out as an \u201cexperiment,\u201d but \u201cif it kind of just causes a spike, it can be hard for your business to plan for that.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Zuckerberg argued that Facebook\u2019s algorithms are \u201cone of the least understood things about what we do.\u201d Specifically, he noted that many people accuse the company of simply optimizing the feed to keep users on the service for as long as possible.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually not true,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many years now, I\u2019ve prohibited any of our feed teams \u2026 from optimizing the systems to encourage the maximum amount of time to be spent. We actually optimize the system for facilitating as many meaningful interactions as possible.\u201d\n\nFor example, he said that when Facebook changed the algorithm to prioritize friends and family content over other types of content (like news), it effectively eliminated 50 million hours of viral video viewing each day. After the company reported its subsequent earnings, Facebook had the biggest drop in market capitalization in U.S. history.\n\nZuckerberg was onstage in New York with News Corp CEO Robert Thomson to discuss the launch of Facebook News, a new tab within the larger Facebook product that\u2019s focused entirely on news. Thomson began the conversation with a simple question: \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d\n\nThe Facebook CEO took this in stride, responding that the question was \u201cone of the nicest things he could have said \u2014 that actually means he thinks we did something good.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg went on to suggest that the company has had a long interest in supporting journalism (\u201cI just think that every internet platform has a responsibility to try to fund and form partnerships to help news\u201d), but that its efforts were initially focused on the News Feed, where the \u201cfundamental architecture\u201d made it hard to find much room for news stories \u2014 particularly when most users are more interested in that content from friends and family.\n\nSo Facebook News could serve as a more natural home for this news (to be clear, the company says news content will continue to appear in the main feed as well). Zuckerberg also said that since past experiments have created such \u201cthrash in the ecosystem,\u201d Facebook wanted to make sure it got this right before launching it.\n\nIn particular, he said the company needed to show that tabs within Facebook, like Facebook Marketplace and Facebook Watch, could attract a meaningful audience. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the majority of Facebook users aren\u2019t interested in these other tabs, but when you\u2019ve got such an enormous user base, even a small percentage can be meaningful.\n\n\u201cI think we can probably get to maybe 20 or 30 million people [visiting Facebook News] over a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat by itself would be very meaningful.\u201d\n\nFacebook is also paying some of the publishers who are participating in Facebook News. Zuckerberg described this as \u201cthe first time we\u2019re forming long-term, stable relationships and partnerships with a lot of publishers.\u201d\n\nSeveral journalists asked for more details about how Facebook decided which publishers to pay, and how much to pay them. Zuckerberg said it\u2019s based on a number of factors, like ensuring a wide range of content in Facebook News, including from publishers who hadn\u2019t been publishing much on the site previously. The company also had to compensate publishers who are taking some of their content out from behind their paywalls.\n\n\u201cThis is not an exact formula \u2014 maybe we\u2019ll get to that over time \u2014 but it\u2019s all within a band,\u201d he said.\n\nZuckerberg was also asked about how Facebook will deal with accuracy and quality, particularly given the recent controversy over its unwillingness to fact check political ads.\n\nHe sidestepped the political ads question, arguing that it\u2019s unrelated to the day\u2019s topics, then said, \u201cThis is a different kind of thing.\u201d In other words, he argued that the company has much more leeway here to determine what is and isn\u2019t included \u2014 both by requiring any participating publishers to abide by Facebook\u2019s publisher guidelines, and by hiring a team of journalists to curate the headlines that show up in the Top Stories section.\n\n\u201cPeople have a different expectation in a space dedicated to high-quality news than they do in a space where the goal is to make sure everyone can have a voice and can share their opinion,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for whether Facebook News will include negative stories about Facebook, Zuckerberg seemed delighted to learn that Bloomberg (mostly) doesn\u2019t cover Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that was a thing a person could do,\u201d he joked. More seriously, he said, \u201cFor better or worse, we\u2019re a prominent part of a lot of the news cycles. I don\u2019t think it would be reasonable to try to have a news tab that didn\u2019t cover the stuff that Facebook is doing. In order to make this a trusted source over time, they have to be covered objectively.\u201d", "description": "While Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seemed cheerful and even jokey when he took the stage today in front of journalists and media executives (at one point, he described the event as \u201cby far the best thing\u201d he\u2019d done this week), he acknowledged that there are reasons for the news industry to be skeptical.
