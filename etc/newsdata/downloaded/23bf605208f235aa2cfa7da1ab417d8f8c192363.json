Only the two top sides will advance to the knock-out phase.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s stage one of a two-stage week completed,\u201d Townsend said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched a lot of Japan. I know they will have watched a lot of us too. And they\u2019ve had big rests into all their games\u2026 we\u2019ve just got to make sure we deliver our best performance,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to because Japan are a very good team.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Non-existent defence \u2013\n\nIn the first ever Test match between the two nations, Russia were defensively weak against Scotland for the full 80 minutes and fly-half Ramil Gaisin\u2019s touted territorial kicking game failed to mount any real pressure.\n\nThe Scottish scrum was solid and when No 8 Ryan Wilson quickly fed George Horne, the scrum-half\u2019s pass found Hastings who stepped back in and rode Dimitry Gerasimov\u2019s tackle for a try he also converted.\n\nHastings made it a personal double within minutes, chasing up on his own chip past a wrong-footed Vasily Artemyev after winger Darcy Graham had done well to keep the ball alive.\n\nHastings converted that and also a third try from Horne after the scrum-half intercepted a Dmitry Perov pass from a defensive Russian line-out on the tryline to make it 21-0 at half-time.\n\nHorne made sure of Scotland\u2019s attacking bonus point when he crossed for the team\u2019s fourth try five minutes into the second-half, a willing recipient of the final pass from Graham after the winger had scythed through a non-existent defence from halfway.\n\nWith Russia flagging and falling badly off the tackles, the floodgates opened as first hooker George Turner crashed over from a driving maul and then wing Tommy Seymour dotted down in the corner.\n\nHorne, moved to the wing to accommodate Henry Pyrgos at half-back, bagged his hat-trick and had a fourth try disallowed for a forward pass.\n\nA raft of replacements on the hour-mark robbed the game of its momentum, as many of the 16,000 schoolchildren in the stadium headed for buses home.\n\nLate tries from skipper John Barclay and replacement hooker Stuart McInally gave the score some added gloss, but Hastings was denied the final word, referee Wayne Barnes harshly ruling out what would have been his hat-trick of tries for a forward pass.", "description": "Shizuoka (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Scotland will play Japan for a spot in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals after a 26-point haul from Adam Hastings helped", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/a7e5c1_scotland-fly-adam-hastings-scored-26-points-hastings-stars-as-scots-set-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
