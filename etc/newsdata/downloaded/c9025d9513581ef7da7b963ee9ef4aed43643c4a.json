The British must tell us what they want,\u201d Le Drian said.\n\nWhen asked if an extension beyond 31 October was possible, Le Drian further warned that the EU\u2019s patience was waning. \u201cWe are not going to do this [extend the deadline] every three months,\u201d the French minister added. The Benn bill due to receive royal assent this week would extend the UK\u2019s membership until 31 January 2020.\n\nThe UK government wants to remove the Irish backstop which would keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\nBut sources in Brussels, where Boris Johnson\u2019s envoy, David Frost, has been in twice-weekly talks with the European commission\u2019s Brexit task force, said the process of finding a ready alternative was proving to be \u201ca farce\u201d .\n\n\u201cThere have been no substantive proposals on how to replace the backstop and the British are pretending otherwise \u2013 we are being instrumentalised for domestic purposes\u201d, said one diplomat.\n\nEU sources have said there is \u201cno evidence\u201d the British government is even working on \u201cconcrete proposals\u201d to strike a Brexit deal, and that the latest resignations from the government, recent reports of \u201csham negotiations\u201d and constant election talk have all contributed to the impression that the government is not serious about finding an agreement.\n\nThe comments appear to confirm the fears of the former work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who resigned on Saturday, citing the lack of effort being put into negotiating a deal.\n\nOn Friday, Frost proposed to hold discussions over an all-Ireland agrifood zone, which Johnson has said may offer a \u201cgerm\u201d of a solution to the current Brexit impasse.\n\nThe EU insists that such a concept on its own falls far short of honouring the commitments made by the British government to maintain the all-Ireland economy after Brexit and avoiding checks on all goods passing between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe have the Brits ringing up saying \u2018It\u2019s great that we are going to work on this agrifood zone idea,\u2019 but it just feels like a distraction from all the other problems that need solving,\u201d a source said.\n\nOf the last meeting with Frost, the diplomat added: \u201cNo proposals on the idea itself were received and therefore discussed.\u201d\n\nIn Brussels, the absence of papers is seen as a sign that the UK is not serious about finding an agreement. British officials reject this criticism: the UK has not put pen to paper, because ministers are worried the EU will immediately shoot down proposals. The UK would like Brussels to share the task of finding an alternative to the backstop, however the EU insists it is the UK\u2019s sole responsibility to find an alternative plan to the agreement negotiated with Theresa May.\n\nAn EU diplomat said that \u201cgiven the present stance of No 10 and the apparent lack of concrete and implementable UK proposals to substitute the backstop, frustration is growing rapidly among the EU27\u201d.\n\nThat exasperation has been further fuelled by the decision to pull UK officials out of some EU meetings as part of what Johnson has described as an \u201cunshackling\u201d from the bloc.\n\n\u201cThey have taken people out of these meetings so they can work on no deal, but then they have to ring round the member states begging for reports of what is being discussed,\u201d complained one EU diplomat. \u201cIt just becomes more ridiculous by the day\u201d.\n\nThe threats by the UK government as it battles with parliament over an extension beyond 31 October could further poison relations when the British government is seeking concessions in Brussels.\n\nDowning Street officials have suggested that if Johnson was forced to extend the UK\u2019s membership of the EU he would not nominate a European commissioner, which would leave the bloc\u2019s institutions in limbo and unable to work. Sources have suggested that this threat would be enough to dissuade the EU from agreeing to an extension.\n\nA former director general of the EU council\u2019s legal services, Jean-Claude Piris, said the UK gambit was based on a misunderstanding.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe commission will be legally able to function and take legal decisions with a member less. If the UK is still an EU member it is that member state which would violate the treaty and could be brought to the EU court of justice.\n\n\u201cThe EU parliament will not find that the commission will not be legally constituted. The commission has already functioned during a period with a number of members inferior to the number set up by the treaty.\n\n\u201cI remember at least one precedent when, in 1999, Martin Bangemann resigned individually from the Santer commission to go and work for Telefonica before that commission\u2019s resignation en bloc became effective. The commission continued to work legally.\u201d\n\nThe French foreign minister\u2019s threat of blocking an extension will be seen as an expression of the irritation but EU sources have suggested it is unlikely come to pass\n\nEU leaders have said that a second referendum or general election would be sufficient reason to extend again and, for all the frustration at the British, there is a reluctance to appear to be pushing the UK out of the bloc.\n\nThe European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has repeatedly said that a no-deal Brexit would never be an EU choice.", "description": "French foreign minister decries \u2018worrying\u2019 lack of progress as EU diplomats express frustration", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3715eed0f575db7519013ccdcc9f4bc98697a94d/0_105_4182_2509/master/4182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a006e7b7ac5105de095a974db2d76e01", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
