This means risks such as life expectancy can be shared across employees in the scheme.\n\nSecretary of State for Work and Pensions Therese Coffey said: \u201cThis Pension Schemes Bill is the next crucial step in making the UK the best place in the world to retire.\n\n\u201cWe are pushing ahead with our latest revolutionary reforms. With this legislation, we\u2019ll ensure reckless bosses are brought to book, transform the way people get information about their retirement savings and introduce a whole new pension to the market boosting returns for millions.\u201d\n\nCharles Counsell, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator (TPR), said: \u201cWe welcome the measures announced in the Pensions Schemes Bill which will allow us to continue in our commitment to be a clearer, quicker and tougher regulator.\n\n\u201cThe Bill would give us the power to set and enforce clearer scheme funding standards in defined benefit pension schemes while also providing early warning of potential problems.\n\n\u201cWhere problems do arise, new criminal sanctions and civil fines will act as a strong deterrent against risky and reckless behaviour, giving us flexibility to issue fines at the appropriate level, depending on severity.\n\n\u201cWe also welcome the innovation of collective defined contribution if this can provide better outcomes for savers and employers without increasing risk.\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with Government to ensure an effective regulatory regime.\u201d\n\nGregg McClymont, director of policy at the People\u2019s Pension, said the pensions dashboard will not work unless all savers can see all their pensions in one place.\n\nHe said: \u201cTotal coverage is therefore crucial.\u201d\n\nSir Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, said some \u201ckey measures\u201d, such as the potential for bringing workers aged under 22 years old into the automatic enrolment workplace savings scheme, were absent.\n\nSir Steve said: \u201cAs a result, the vital expansion of automatic enrolment is now on hold.\u201d", "description": "A new Bill also paves the way for `pensions dashboards\u00b4 - where people will be able to see all their pensions in one place online - to be introduced.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/wire-19715146-1571094234-693_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
