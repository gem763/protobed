President Obama, that is.\n\nWith the House voting Wednesday to condemn President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP congressman slams Trump over report that U.S. bombed former anti-ISIS coalition headquarters US to restore 'targeted assistance' to Central American countries after migration deal Trump says lawmakers should censure Schiff MORE over Turkey\u2019s slaughtering of the Kurds in northern Syria, it is easy to forget that Trump is not the first American president to be played by Ankara. In Washington\u2019s quixotic quest for Middle East peace, the courtship of Erdogan \u2014 the delusion that the \u201cTurkish model\u201d is proof that sharia and Western liberalism can seamlessly blend \u2014 is a bipartisan affair.\n\nI traced the history in \u201cSpring Fever: The Illusion of Islamic Democracy\u201d (2012). Coming to prominence as Istanbul\u2019s mayor in the mid-1990s, Erdogan proclaimed himself the \u201cservant of sharia,\u201d preferring to be thought of as the city\u2019s \u201cimam.\u201d He was convicted of sedition against the secular Kemalist order in a 1998, after a revolt led by the anti-Western, anti-Semitic, sharia-supremacist party that morphed into the AKP that he leads today.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nErdogan was steeped in Muslim Brotherhood ideology. Like community organizers of the left, the Brothers pursue upheaval under the cloak of \u201csocial justice\u201d (the AKP is the \u201cJustice and Development\u201d party). When Islamist opposition fractured in 2002, the AKP captured parliament despite winning just a third of the vote, and Erdogan was promptly elevated to prime minister.\n\nAnxious to cultivate Muslim allies post-9/11, President Bush\u2019s administration slobbered over Turkey\u2019s new leader. Here, we were told, was a true \u201cmoderate\u201d blazing the trail of \u201cIslamic democracy.\u201d Exactly backwards. Turkey already was a democracy when Erdogan and the Islamists came along. Their goal was to reverse Ataturk\u2019s post-Ottoman turn to the West.\n\nThe cagey premier put it this way: \u201cDemocracy is just the train we board to reach our destination.\u201d Far from demonstrating that Bush\u2019s Islamic democracy project could work, Erdogan was proof that, given the opportunity in a Muslim majority country, sharia supremacists would coopt the democratic election process, gradually installing Islamic law, with all the suffocation of liberty that entails.\n\nAs the Bush administration gushed over him, Western leaders suggested that Turkey could be fully integrated into Europe. Of course, Erdogan despises Europe. Ever the opportunist, though, he knew the integration his opposition craved could not be achieved absent conformance to core Western principles: religious liberty and civilian control of the military. Ironically, resistance to these principles was key to Turkey\u2019s westward orientation \u2014 without it, the Kemalist establishment could not suppress sharia supremacism. By ostensibly supporting integration, Erdogan enlisted the West\u2019s help in dismantling the bulwark against Islamism.\n\nAs Erdogan aided and abetted Hamas and Hezbollah, all the while conducting low-thrum hostilities against Israel, President Obama drew him close \u2014 very publicly elevating the would-be caliph as his ally and adviser. The American president backed Erdogan\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood allies in Egypt, to disastrous effect \u2014 wholly predictable to those with eyes to see, but not, alas, to Western elites insistent that the \u201cArab Spring\u201d augured a democratic flourishing rather than the rise of supremacist Islam.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter the debacles in Cairo, where the Brothers were quickly ousted, and Libya, where Obama also backed Islamists against an unsavory American counterterrorism ally (as Moammar Gadhafi was regarded at the time), Obama prudently swore off intervention in Syria. Nevertheless, he remained mired in Washington\u2019s policy confusion.\n\nFirst, he embraced Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad as a democratic reformer. Then, siding with the Brotherhood, he decided Assad was an obstacle to democratization and a confederate in Iran\u2019s Shiite terrorism. Finally, seduced by the allure of a historic Iran nuclear deal, he retreated from his \u201cred line\u201d against Tehran\u2019s Syrian accomplice and pivoted to fighting ISIS \u2014 the latest iteration of Sunni jihadism for which Obama\u2019s withdrawal of American troops in Iraq was being blamed, as if jihadism were spawned by \u201cvacuums\u201d and not indigenous Islamic fundamentalism.\n\nTime after time, Obama promised there would be no American \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Syria. We would find proxies. This brought him into conflict with his friend Erdogan.\n\nUnlike the Americans, Turkey\u2019s premier deftly played rivals against each other \u2014 helping Iran circumvent sanctions while helping the Sunni jihadists wage war against Syria; drawing closer to the Kremlin while alternatively posing as a NATO ally and NATO malcontent.\n\nThe Erdogan-Obama bromance was strained by the Kurds. In Turkey, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) led a terrorist insurrection seeking Kurdish autonomy. Across the border in Syria, a branch of the PKK became America\u2019s most capable proxies. Not to worry, Obama assured Erdogan: The U.S. backing of the Kurds would be limited, and there would be no permanent Kurdish zone on Turkey\u2019s border.\n\nAs night follows day, there soon were a de facto Kurdish zone on Turkey\u2019s border, American boots on the ground, and an escalating American presence. When Obama left office, a reckoning was inevitable. So now it\u2019s Trump\u2019s turn to find that indulging Erdogan leads to trouble in the Middle East.\n\nThe president campaigned on the contradictory agenda of pulling American forces out and crushing ISIS. Once elected, he ratcheted up the mission to \u201cdefeat\u201d ISIS. The success he often touts in this regard is highly qualified: The territorial caliphate has been eradicated, and that\u2019s a boon; but ISIS is not defeated, and it has always been more effective as an underground jihadist organization than a sovereign trying to govern territory.\n\nMeanwhile, al Qaeda has been left virtually untouched. Trump ditched the Kurds at Erdogan\u2019s insistence and with assurances about a limited clearing operation. Now, he is being blamed for a bloodbath. Our troops have not been removed; they were merely redeployed out of harm\u2019s way, making it appear that Erdogan is calling the shots. Ankara gravitates toward Moscow, while we ponder the future of NATO and the safety of our forces and nukes at Incirlik air base.\n\nAmerican administrations change, but two things persist: The Islamic democracy delusion and Erdogan as its foil.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andrew C.
