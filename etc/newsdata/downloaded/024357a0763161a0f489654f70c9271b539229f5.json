The foundation's name translates in English to \"yes you can.\"\n\nFaridodin \u201cFredi\u201d Lajvardi, a 30-year teaching veteran, convinced the foundation to also focus on women in STEM because they too are an underserved community, data shows.\n\nFaridodin Lajvardi/Si Se Puede Foundation\n\nOnly 13% of engineers are women and just 8% of female college students enter their freshman year intending to major in engineering, math, statistics or computer science, according to data shared last year by the Society of Women Engineers.\n\n\"I thought let\u2019s make an all-women team to see if we can disprove some of the stereotypes about women in engineering,\" said Lajvardi, who described himself as \"stunned\" by the statistics. \"If our team causes another team to form and then other, eventually the idea is it won\u2019t be such a novelty to have an all-women\u2019s team and then we\u2019ve achieved success.\"\n\nFaridodin Lajvardi/Si Se Puede Foundation\n\nLajvardi and others, including an ASU professor, mentored the Desert WAVES team in their rookie year. He hoped the team would finish in the top 50% at their first international competition, noting, \"We didn't expect to get this good this fast.\"\n\n\"During the week-long competition everyone thought just the Texas A&M team was the only all-women team because they\u2019ve been there for four years, so over the course of the week people were figuring it out,\" he said. \"What was also getting people\u2019s attention was our consistency.\"\n\nThe team is already eyeing a first-place finish at next year's competition.\n\nFaridodin Lajvardi/Si Se Puede Foundation\n\nThe interest in the team has meanwhile grown at ASU, with as many as 30 women expressing interest in joining the team.\n\n\"I hope that when other people, especially girls, look at us that they can be inspired by what we were able to do and to follow what they want to do,\" said Foster, who plans to return to the team. \"It doesn\u2019t matter if they want to be an engineer or a teacher or a nurse, if they want to do it, they should go for it.\"\n\n\"You can achieve great things and it doesn\u2019t matter who you are,\" she said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/desert-1-ht-er-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
