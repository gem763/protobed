The news illustrated the persistence of foreign efforts to interfere in U.S. elections, four years after Russians took aim at the 2016 race \u2014 and some lawmakers took early aim at Zuckerberg over the issue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, the panel\u2019s Democratic chairwoman, opened the session on that topic, saying \u201cRussia and Iran are at it again for the upcoming election.\u201d She also criticized Facebook\u2019s decision not to fact-check political ads. The matter has riled Democratic presidential candidates, who have asked -- unsuccessfully -- for Facebook to remove an ad from President Trump\u2019s presidential campaign that they have said is filled with falsehoods.\n\nThe policy \u201cgives politicians a license to lie so you can earn more money off this division, I suppose,\u201d Waters said.\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged that the company in 2016 had been on its \u201cback foot in terms of preventing Russia from interfering in our elections.\u201d But he stressed Facebook\u2019s defenses against disinformation are more \u201csophisticated than any other company has at this point, and frankly, governments too.\u201d\n\nOn political ads, the Facebook chief added: \u201cThe very small percent of our business that\u2019s made up of political ads does not come anywhere close to justifying the kind of controversy\u201d the company has experienced.\n\n\u201cThere are serious concerns in light of the news of the last 24 hours,\u201d said Rep. Sylvia Garcia (Tex.), a Democrat on the panel who also has been sharply critical of Facebook\u2019s Libra plans. She said a barrage of criticism and questioning about disinformation and the 2020 election is \u201ccertainly possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost unavoidable,\u201d said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), who met privately with Zuckerberg on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s anticipating that.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2018s testimony comes amid a brutal month for Facebook. The company learned this week that it faces an antitrust investigation by Democratic and Republican attorneys general in 47 states, territories and the District of Columbia, far more than the lead state behind the probe, New York, had previously announced. Federal authorities also are scrutinizing Facebook for potential violations of competition law.\n\nBut the company\u2019s most significant political headaches are connected with the 2020 presidential election. Facebook first stirred controversy this month when it declined to remove an ad from President Trump\u2019s campaign that contained falsehoods about former vice president Joe Biden, who is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden and others, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), upbraided the tech giant for essentially profiting off a form of disinformation. But Facebook argued that it struck the right policy position, allowing users to see and interpret political speech on their own. Zuckerberg told The Washington Post in an interview that he feared an \u201cerosion of truth\u201d online but still felt that Facebook achieved the proper balance.\n\nDays later, Facebook announced that a number of Russian and Iranian accounts had sought to spread disinformation on its services, including Instagram, though Zuckerberg insisted that the company had made great strides in purging such content more swiftly since the 2016 election. \u201cElections have changed significantly since 2016,\u201d he said, \u201cand Facebook has changed, too.\u201d\n\nSome of the lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee have emerged as vocal critics of Facebook, raising the possibility that Zuckerberg could face questions Wednesday about the company\u2019s size and approach to the 2020 race.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), for example, last weekend blasted Facebook at a political rally for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), another 2020 presidential contender. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want Mark Zuckerberg making decisions over my life,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the panel.\n\nWith Libra, lawmakers led by Waters, the committee\u2019s chairwoman, have decried Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency plans. This summer, her panel grilled Dave Marcus, the Facebook executive overseeing Libra, and she led a delegation to Switzerland, where the Libra Association \u2014 a nonprofit grouping of companies that will ultimately pilot the digital currency \u2014 is to be based. She returned from the trip saying her \u201cconcerns remain with allowing a large tech company to create a privately controlled, alternative global currency.\u201d\n\nIn his testimony, Zuckerberg stressed that Facebook is \u201ccommitted to taking the time to get this right,\u201d echoing comments he made privately to lawmakers during a trip to Washington earlier this year. He plans to say that Libra is most beneficial to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and other financial services.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Zuckerberg highlighted Facebook\u2019s plan to shift some of the responsibility away from the company, telling lawmakers Facebook does not \u201cexpect to be leading those efforts going forward,\u201d according to his prepared testimony. He said the Libra Foundation \u201cwill be driving the project from now on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe this is something that needs to get built, but I get that I\u2019m not the ideal messenger right now,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I\u2019m sure people wish it were anyone but Facebook that were helping to propose this. But there\u2019s a reason we care about this. And that\u2019s because Facebook is about putting power in people\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg returned to the congressional spotlight on Wednesday, testifying at a hearing that could lay bare the broad bipartisan fears about the tech giant\u2019s preparedness entering the 2020 presidential election.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/W8QsWIbuCYdC6GiUg2kb42oyVn4=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-23-2019/t_e6ede827cd05479daed147cd8577b610_name_t_1525196000073_name_Facebook_Developer_Conference_66340_jpg_8d72f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
