Yeah. What else do you want me to say?\u201d\n\nAfter perhaps the most uninspiring loss of Petersen\u2019s tenure, Washington is at the crossroads of a season that started with the Huskies positioned as one of the Pac-12\u2019s best shots to get into the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe Huskies have two conference losses just three games into the conference slate after being overwhelmed in a 23-13 loss to Stanford on Saturday. They\u2019ve looked great in impressive wins over BYU and Southern California, but completely lost offensively in losses to California and Stanford.\n\nThe loss to Stanford dropped the Huskies from the AP Top 25 for just the second time since the start of the 2016 season. The next two weeks will be a major indicator of where Washington\u2019s season is headed. The Huskies travel to Pac-12 South-leading Arizona for a Saturday night matchup before returning home to host Pac-12 North leader Oregon on Oct. 19.\n\nMost of the concern seems to be on the offensive side.\n\nThe Huskies offense was going to go through a transition no matter what with several new starters at key positions. But the jolt the Huskies were hoping to get with Jacob Eason stepping into the starting quarterback role has only materialized in spurts.\n\nThe blame can\u2019t be isolated to one area. Eason hasn\u2019t been great in conference play. Washington\u2019s run game was abandoned for stretches against the Cardinal. Wide receivers had key drops in both losses this season.\n\nWashington is averaging just 363 yards per game in conference play and 20 points. Eason is completing just 54.3% of his passes in conference play and averaging 149.3 yards passing. Wide receiver Aaron Fuller has 18 catches in conference play; Andre Baccellia is next among wide receivers with just six.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to tighten that up, throwing and catching for sure,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cThe other thing that really stood out, obviously, on offense, was third downs. That was one area where we got beat. We got beat bad in that area. We\u2019ve been pretty good there, and that was painful.\u201d\n\nPetersen said if he could make one significant change in the Stanford game, it would have been to stay with the run game more. The Huskies had 19 carries from their three running backs and 36 pass attempts from Eason. Richard Newton averaged 6.4 yards per carry in his 10 rushes before suffering a foot injury. But Salvon Ahmed - who rushed for 119 yards vs. California and 153 vs. USC - had just six carries for 28 yards.\n\n\u201cWe should have run the ball a little bit more just looking back, because our offensive line, our backs were doing a pretty good job of getting downhill,\u201d Petersen said.\n\nIn 74 games under Petersen, the Huskies have just one victory when scoring less than 17 points. That came in last year\u2019s Pac-12 title game when Washington beat Utah 10-7, and the only touchdown was scored by the Huskies\u2019 defense. They are 3-12 when scoring less than 20.\n\nThey will undoubtedly need to score more this weekend facing Arizona, which has scored 28 or more in four of five games.\n\n\u201cDo we need to score more than 13 points? Yes. That\u2019s obvious, right?\u201d Petersen said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to win many Pac-12 games scoring (13).\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chris Petersen didn't have to delve deep when assessing what went wrong with Washington's trip to Stanford.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/washington_stanford_football_63182_c0-203-4864-3038_s1770x1032.jpg?6cb6db26da9cc5f0525843856ceb632fe1849638", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
