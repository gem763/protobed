I note that the Reserve Bank Governor [Philip Lowe] is on the record as saying he cannot foresee a scenario where unconventional monetary policy options would be required for Australia.\"\n\nANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott called for a summit to debate the use of quantitative easing but federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg dismissed that idea saying it was a \"distraction from the failure by the big banks to pass on the recent rate cuts in full.\"\n\nIn his testimony to a parliamentary economics committee in August, Dr Lowe said quantitative easing was \"unlikely\" but \"possible\".\n\n\"Given the world we're in, it is prudent to look at these things. As I said, it's unlikely, but it is possible.\"\n\n\"The world's uncertain, and there are scenarios where we might decide that this is warranted. If that's the case, it's prudent for us to have done the work in advance to see what we would do. It's really contingency planning. We're thinking about what we might do.\"\n\nA week later when asked what the lowest interest rate the central bank would get down to, RBA deputy governor Guy Debelle said between 0.5 per cent and 0.25 per cent.\n\n\"We\u2019ve done a fair bit of thinking about that, and if you look at what\u2019s happening in the US, Canada and the UK when they got down to their lows it was somewhere around about a quarter to half a per cent.\"\n\nSince that statement the Reserve Bank has cut the official interest rate by 25 basis points to a record low 0.75 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has sparked further concerns about the timing of quantitative easing.\n\nAMP Capital's Shane Oliver said the probability of using quantitative easing was rising and that once the bank hits 0.25 per cent it will start.\n\n\"Once rate cuts are exhausted at 0.25 per cent the RBA would likely turn to other unconventional monetary policy measures if needed next year including quantitative easing. This is not our base case but the probability of it occurring is rising.\n\n\"Our assessment is that unconventional monetary policy measures may help in Australia, but it will depend on the measure deployed and their impact will be limited particularly compared to overseas.\"\n\nThis week a Bank for International Settlements report chaired by RBA governor Philip Lowe broadly endorsed the efficacy of crisis-era central bank tools, such as buying financial assets and negative interest rates to protect world economies from recession.\n\nHowever, former Reserve Bank of Australia board member Warwick McKibbin warned this week that unconventional monetary policy would wreck the financial system's allocation of capital and undermine capitalism.\n\nThe European Central Bank has already promised to restart its bond buying to the tune of \u20ac20 billion ($32.6 billion) a month.\n\nWestpac's senior economist Bill Evans said the Reserve bank would probably target asset purchases first if it was to engage in unconventional monetary policy.\n\n\"Asset purchases seem to be the favourite at the moment,\" he said.", "description": "Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has moved to soften the ground for further interest rate cuts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3a7c3a76a6f8da4223d48740a6df6b3f1a2307da", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
