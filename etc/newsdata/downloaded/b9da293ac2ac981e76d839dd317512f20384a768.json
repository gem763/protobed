The yen has been weak too. Last week it hit a 2-1/2-month low.\n\nThe Bank of Japan meets next week and its Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told Reuters at the IMF meetings that it could \"certainly\" cut rates again if needed.\n\n\"If we need further easing of monetary conditions, we would certainly reduce short- to medium-term interest rates. But we don't want to reduce super-long interest rates,\" Kuroda said on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nCENTRAL FOCUS\n\nThere is plenty of central bank action in store this week too. Thursday will be Mario Draghi's last meeting in charge at the European Central Bank and comes amid divergence over its recent decision to restart bond buying.\n\nChina's yuan firmed on Monday after its central bank fixed the daily midpoint at its strongest in five weeks, and a comment from the central bank chief that the exchange rate was at the \"appropriate level\" reinforced market sentiment.\n\nPrior to market opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate at 7.0680 per dollar. It was 10 pips firmer than the previous fix of 7.0690, and the strongest since Sept.16.\n\nIn a statement posted on the International Monetary Fund website on Saturday, PBOC Governor Yi Gang said the yuan is at \"an appropriate level\" based on economic and market fundamentals.\n\n\"Depreciation since the beginning of August has been driven and determined by market forces and reflects shifts in market dynamics and volatilities in global foreign exchange markets, amid recent global economic and financial developments and escalating trade tensions,\" Yi said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Tomo Uetake in Sydney Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "description": "The dollar was crawling towards its worst month since January 2018 on Monday as intermittent waves of Brexit optimism pushed the pound to a 5-1/2 month high and kept the euro's bumper October intact.
