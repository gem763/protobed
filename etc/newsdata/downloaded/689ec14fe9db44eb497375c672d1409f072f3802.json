It\u2019s possible that the item has also sold out.\n\nJamaica\u2019s minister of culture, gender, entertainment and sport, Honorable Olivia \u2018Babsy\u2019 Grange, shared a statement on Instagram that Kanye, 42, and his team had been selling the Jamaican-branded merchandise without permission and has now banned sales of some of the items.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statement read: \u2018It has come to my attention that items of clothing printed with national symbols and emblems are being offered for sale online.\n\nKanye\u2019s merch includes seals and flags of Jamaica (Picture: Splash News)\n\nThe rapper has brought his Sunday Service to Jamaica (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I noticed Kanye West and members of his choir wearing similarly emblazoned items during their special performance in Kingston last night, but I was not aware at the time that the costumes were being sold online.\n\n\u2018We neither received a request for nor did we give permission for our national symbols and emblems to be used for a commercial manner or otherwise. I have since requested that the items be withdrawn and the vendor has agreed to do so.\u2019\n\nGrange went on to explain how several years ago, a strategy had been put in place to deal with the proper use of Jamaica\u2019s emblems and symbols. However that work was \u2018stopped at the change of administrations\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019re still waiting on Jesus Is King, Ye (Picture: WireImage)\n\nThe minister continued: \u2018I have been granted permission to reestablish the committee and to continue the work.\n\n\u2018The membership of the committee [will] include representatives of the Office of the Prime Minister, the Jamaica Intellectual Property Office, the Ministry of Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sport and others.\u2019\n\nOn Saturday, Kanye hosted a Sunday Service at Kingston\u2019s Emancipation Park along with a choir of around 120 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rapper opened the service with gospel song, Prince of Peace, and later performed Damian Marley\u2019s Welcome To Jamrock before aptly closing with Jesus Walks.\n\nIt was recently reported that Kanye lost his bid to trademark the Sunday Service name as it is already registered by someone else.\n\nA release date for Jesus Is King is yet to be announced but an IMAX experience about the album will hit cinemas from 25 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
