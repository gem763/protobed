Citing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, Weisenthal said no regulators would want to approve fiat onramps to pump money into the bitcoin ecosystem. First, the move would make fiat unattractive to investors. And second, it would increase the amount of illicit financial transactions.\n\nWeisenthal thinks bitcoin has only one critical use case: to facilitate trades that the governments and regulators \u2013 or \u201cthe MAN\u201d \u2013 do not want anyone to make. That makes the cryptocurrency an ideal tool designed to serve criminals \u2013 and criminals only. Creating new markets to inject more into bitcoin, therefore, would increase the number of financial crimes. So, one way or another, an average law enforcement agency would attempt to get rid of bitcoin once and all.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re building or launching these institutionally-grade products, how sure are you that down the road regulators won\u2019t come in and shut it all down,\u201d questioned Weisenthal. \u201cThere is so much interest in this space, but is anyone thinking this through?\u201d\n\nThe Man Will Come After Big Bitcoiners?\n\nThe statements were a part of a newsletter that showcased bitcoin as an ecosystem run by two kinds of users: speculators and transactors. Weisenthal said the bitcoin protocol works when certain people expect more massive profits out of their so-called bitcoin investments \u2013 or when they use bitcoin to conduct transactions away from the prying eyes of regulators. Both kinds of users, wrote Weisenthal, compliment each other.\n\nIn today's @Markets newsletter, I wrote about how the point of Bitcoin is do to the transactions that THE MAN doesn't want you to do (including illegal transactions). And the allowance of a Bitcoin ETFs would essentially be a big subsidy to this market https://t.co/e5TYtjIuOw pic.twitter.com/fkMbexuv8v \u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) October 17, 2019\n\nThe introduction of Wall Street-level products, meanwhile, would boost the number in both kinds: speculators and transactors. Weisenthal added:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the business of creating institutional onramps to crypto, you have to be cognizant of the risk that one day regulators wake up and ask: Wait, why did we provide a gateway to provide liquidity into [the] space whose express purpose is to let people evade The Man?\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin Community\u2019s Response\n\n\u201cThis is wildly inaccurate,\u201d replied Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets, about Weisenthal\u2019s assessment. He added:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re claiming that non-censorship is the only value prop of Bitcoin. What about the non-seizure element? What about the disinflationary monetary supply? Or the sound money element? Or pseudonymity? Please stop writing nonsense & misinformation.\u201d\n\nLarry Cermak of the Block, meanwhile, agreed with Weisenthal, differing only with one point about the \u201ctypes of bitcoin investors.\u201d", "description": "Law enforcement authorities can shut down bitcoin anytime, according to Bloomberg Digital's executive editor Joe Weisenthal.
