For comparison, most phones only manage a 60Hz refresh rate. Your TV or iPad will generally manage 120Hz.\n\nIn real life, it means that browsing menus or watching animations is smoother and more fluid. OnePlus has just emerged with its second handset of the year (one mid-cycle refresh has become standard) in the form of the OnePlus 7T.\n\nUnlike the standard OnePlus 7 \u2013 which was released alongside the Pro at a slightly more affordable price \u2013 the 7T does boast that all-important 90Hz refresh rate. The phone was officially announced at an event in London last week with the price set at \u00a3549, SIM-free. It\u2019s a shade more than the \u00a3499 the OnePlus 7 launched with, but still good value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a small, teardrop notch on the 7T as it doesn\u2019t have the 7 Pro\u2019s headline-grabbing pop-out selfie camera, but the bezels have been reduced from the OnePlus 7. This is a long phone \u2013 it\u2019s got a 6.55-inch display with a 20:9 aspect ratio. But it\u2019s also pin-sharp with a 2,400 x 1,080 resolution at 400 pixels-per-inch.\n\nAll of that translates to a nice user experience before you\u2019ve even flipped the phone over.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T follows the triple-lens camera crowd (Metro)\n\nOn the back is a triple lens camera and OnePlus\u2019s breezy Glacier Blue colour option. It reflects the light like the dew on a frosty autumn morning. Unfortunately, it also collects grubby fingerprints so you may be making use of a case before long. OnePlus does do a range of decent official cases that you can find on its website here.\n\nCamera performance is inherently subjective and there\u2019s only so much you can do by throwing in more lenses and functions and features.\n\nIn my opinion, the 7T is plenty good enough for what most people use their phone cameras for.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m not often perched on a cliff capturing sparkles of golden sunlight reflecting off the ocean. It\u2019s more likely I\u2019ll whip out a phone inside a grotty local pub to snap a copy of the wall poster showing kick-off times for England\u2019s rugby world cup matches.\n\nStill, the OnePlus 7T brings the goods.\n\nIt\u2019s got a telephoto lens with a 2x zoom 12MP camera alongside an f/2.2 lens and an ultra-wide 117-degree field-of-view 16MP camera. The main lens is a 48MP f/1.6 aperture with optical image stabilisation to stop blurring and noise from shaky hands.\n\nHere\u2019s a standard shot taken with the OnePlus 7T\u2019s camera on auto settings (Metro)\n\nHere\u2019s the same shot zoomed in using the telephoto lens (Metro)\n\nAnd the same image again, but this time it\u2019s shot using the 7T\u2019s ultra wide angle lens (Metro)\n\nYou can shoot 4K video at 60fps and also take advantage of a new Macro Mode which lets you capture a subject from as little as 2.5cm away in full quality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnePlus says you\u2019ll be able to capture \u2018intricate details that even the human eye struggles to see\u2019.\n\nOnePlus has added a Super Macro mode for the close ups. Here\u2019s a shot using it (Metro)\n\n\u2026and here\u2019s the same shot even closer (Metro)\n\nThere\u2019s also the return of Nightscape mode, which combines information from multiple frames with various exposures to create a brighter photo in low light. It\u2019s similar to Night Mode on the iPhone or Night Sight on the Pixel phones.\n\nOnePlus still hasn\u2019t bundled wireless charging into the 7T but has kept its famous \u2018Warp Charge\u2019 feature. It juices up the phone\u2019s 3,800mAh battery to 70% in half an hour. Any battery improvements that can be made are welcome because I found both on the 7 Pro and on the 7T that the battery life wasn\u2019t great.\n\nBecause of the big screens and their 90Hz refresh rate (not to mention I have the brightness all the way up and Bluetooth on all the time) I was regularly having to charge up twice a day. Not a problem if you\u2019ve got Warp Charge, but that may require you to have two separate chargers \u2013 one at home and one at the office.\n\nThere\u2019s no way I could make it through 24 hours without charging, and that\u2019s with fairly standard usage.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T comes with plenty of power under the hood (OnePlus)\n\nPerhaps part of the battery issue comes from the stellar performance of the phone. With 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, I was constantly using the phone to pull documents and videos from the web for either editing or watching.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat performance is bound to suffer over the three or four year lifespan of the phone, but that\u2019s going to be the case whatever handset you go for.\n\nAre there drawbacks to the OnePlus 7T? Yes, there are.\n\nAs I mentioned there\u2019s no wireless charging and there\u2019s also no microSD expansion and no IP waterproof certification. It\u2019s also a big phone which makes it uncomfortable for those wanting something smaller for pockets or handbags.\n\nBut you can\u2019t accuse OnePlus of not putting extras in there for its (extremely vocal) fans.\n\nThere\u2019s Zen Mode, which locks down certain parts of the phone to give you a break from the vortex of technology. There\u2019s Gaming Mode, which disables certain background features and optimises the graphics for gaming. There\u2019s Reading Mode, which turns the display monochrome for a more comfortable, e-reader-like reading experience and can be set to come on automatically when, for example, you open the Kindle app.\n\nThe blue finish looks fantastic (Metro)\n\nBest of all is the price. At just \u00a3549, the OnePlus 7T stakes a great claim as the phone to beat for those of us with pockets not-quite-deep enough for an iPhone 11 or Samsung Galaxy S10.\n\nIn my opinion, the only real competition the OnePlus 7T has for your hard-earned cash is the Google Pixel 3a. Both phones are great Android devices, but the 90Hz screen of the 7T along with its power and storage options mean it edges it over Google\u2019s offering for me.\n\nThere\u2019s not quite enough here to merit the jump from a year or two-year-old phone but if you\u2019ve got a device that\u2019s older than that and are looking for a phone that punches above its weight, you could do a lot worse than the OnePlus 7T.", "description": "OnePlus' mid-cycle refresh has a lot to like", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OnePlus-7T-390f_1570781292.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
