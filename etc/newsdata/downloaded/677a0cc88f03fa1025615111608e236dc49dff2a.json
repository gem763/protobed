Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. halted trading of shares in its oil transport unit, the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Costas Paris writes, as some oil customers canceled transports for fear of getting tangled up in the U.S. sanctions tied to Iranian crude exports. The Trump administration blacklisted several Chinese companies this week, saying they took part in illicit trade in Iranian oil. The companies include two tanker-operating units of Cosco. The action doesn\u2019t affect other Cosco operations, including its big container business. But brokers in Asia say some oil shippers, including China\u2019s Unipec, moved orders to other carriers, and some are wary of violating sanctions and losing access to the U.S. energy market. The impact on the tanker market could spread if shippers shy away from Cosco\u2019s very large crude carriers.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES\n\nApple Inc. is trying to keep one of its major suppliers running as the company rolls out its latest iPhone models. The electronics giant is looking at doubling its planned investment in financially-strapped Japan Display Inc. under a revised bailout plan for the manufacturer, the WSJ\u2019s Takashi Mochizuki reports. Japan Display says a Chinese investment fund is dropping an agreement to supply more than half of the $742 million needed to rescue the business, leaving the manufacturer of liquid crystal displays for the new iPhone 11 to look for new investors. Apple has already put $100 million into Japan Display, and the new wrinkle is a sign of the closely intertwined relationship between the supplier and buyer. Japan Display gets about 60% of its revenue from Apple. And Apple\u2019s new phones cost so much partly because there are a limited number of suppliers for the screens.\n\nA big bet that U.S. hardwood lumber companies placed on China is collapsing. Exports to China of the wood often used in furniture manufacturing have fallen 40% this year and prices are diving since Beijing placed retaliatory tariffs on the goods. The WSJ\u2019s Austen Hufford reports several companies are laying off workers and slashing output, and supply chains are resetting as other countries rush to meet Chinese demand while U.S. companies look for new markets along with government assistance tied to the lost trade. In the first seven months of 2018 the U.S. sent 54% of all of its exported hardwood lumber by volume to China, but that share has fallen to 41% this year. U.S. hardwood producers started ramping up to meet Chinese demand two decades ago. But the focus left the companies unable to quickly find new buyers as trade tensions flared.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201c We are not involved in any illicit oil movement. \u201d \u2014A Cosco Shipping executive.\n\nNumber of the Day 18.7% Year-over-year increase in loaded container imports at Georgia\u2019s Port of Savannah in August.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS\n\nFederal accident investigators called for broad changes in airline engineering principles and training in the wake of two fatal Boeing Co. 737 MAX crashes.
