I\u2019m not feeling any pressure from inside the club.\u2019\n\nThese words could easily have come from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as he continues to wrestle with the challenge of reviving Manchester United.\n\nIn fact, they were uttered by David Moyes in the aftermath of United beating Olympiacos in March 2014 to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League, a scenario the club would gladly take now.\n\nMoyes was gone just weeks later, 10 months after succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson on a six-year contract.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has overseen Manchester United's worst start to a season in 30 years\n\nHis mistake, Moyes has said many times since, was believing that his new employers \u2014 and in particular executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward \u2014 would give him anything like that amount of time.\n\n\u2018I got the job and I expected it to be a six-year plan,\u2019 he said later. \u2018We knew it was going to take time to make the necessary changes and evolve. In the end, I don\u2019t feel I was given time to succeed or fail.\n\n\u2018It could well be that gone are the days of long-term planning at United.\u2019\n\nDavid Moyes expected to be given more time than he was by United chief Ed Woodward\n\nSolskjaer would do well to heed those words as the international break brings respite from United\u2019s worst start to a league season in 30 years, with his team two points off the relegation zone.\n\nPerformances have dipped alarmingly, confidence is ebbing away and the nostalgic optimism generated by Solskjaer\u2019s early success has evaporated.\n\nIf that isn\u2019t bad enough, United\u2019s next opponents are ruthless, resurgent Liverpool.\n\nThe situation feels worse than it did under Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho.\n\nDefeat by Newcastle saw Solskjaer's side drop into the bottom half of the Premier League\n\nAnd yet United insist Solskjaer\u2019s job is secure. They have bought into a long-term rebuilding project aimed at clearing up the mess of the last six years and remain satisfied that he is the man to oversee it.\n\nClub sources maintain nothing has changed in the wake of Sunday\u2019s 1-0 defeat at Newcastle which Sportsmail expert Martin Keown said \u2018might be the beginning of the end for this manager\u2019.\n\nYou could argue that the amiable Norwegian deserves time and it still appears as though he will be given it.\n\nThe big question is, just how far is Woodward prepared to let things slide before deciding enough is enough?\n\nManchester United\u2019s 3-1 defeat at Anfield last December sealed Jose Mourinho\u2019s fate\n\nFor Moyes and Van Gaal it was failure to qualify for the Champions League. Solskjaer may not be held to the same standards, but how low can he go?\n\nHistory tells us the end at United comes swiftly and brutally.\n\nMoyes thought he had time. The proud Scotsman, devastated to learn of his fate through the media, was reduced to tears by United\u2019s decision.\n\nVan Gaal thought he had time. He wanted a two-year contract but United insisted on three. Things changed, however, when Mourinho became available \u2014 a situation with striking parallels to United\u2019s long-standing interest in unsettled Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino.\n\n\u2018Suddenly, Mourinho was out after one-and-a-half years of my contract and I knew United wanted him one day,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018They told me only after it was leaked out and it was the biggest disappointment of my life. United put my head in a noose and I was publicly placed on the gallows.\u2019\n\nLouis van Gaal's wife claimed his sacking was discussed during FA Cup final at Wembley\n\nVan Gaal claimed his wife Truus overheard members of Woodward\u2019s family discussing his sacking in a lift at Wembley before he had been officially informed after winning the FA Cup in what proved to be his last game.\n\nRecalling his final months in charge, Van Gaal said: \u2018My wife told me that the attitude of the board had changed. Women have this intuition. They smell it.\n\n\u2018I denied it, even to my wife, because between me as manager and Ed Woodward, everything was running as normal.\u2019\n\nMourinho\u2019s demise, on the other hand, was described as \u2018death by a thousand cuts\u2019 due to the sheer volume of issues engulfing his reign by the time he was axed.\n\nThe feeling is that United and Woodward have learned from the chopping and changing of recent years. The club have shown faith in Solskjaer and need to see it through this time.\n\nThe situation feels worse than it did under David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho\n\nIndeed, his former team-mate Gary Neville is among those who believe the blame lies squarely in the boardroom rather than with the managers themselves \u2014 that Solskjaer needs more time and more new signings before he can be judged.\n\n\u2018The board need to hold their nerve,\u2019 Neville told Sky Sports. \u2018They\u2019re responsible for this with poor recruitment and poor selection of managers.\n\n\u2018Manchester United are now getting the pain they deserve for poor decisions at board level and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needs to make sure that he gets the opportunity to spend the money the others have had.\u2019\n\nThe trouble is, when things go wrong at United these days, sooner or later one man pays the price \u2014 and it isn\u2019t Woodward.\n\n\n\n", "description": "His mistake, Moyes has said many times since, was believing that his new employers - and in particular executive vice- chairman Ed Woodward - would give him anything like that amount of time.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/21/19413162-0-image-a-7_1570480552567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
