Gaby Wood, literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation, said prize trustees repeatedly told the judges they couldn't have two winners, but they \"essentially staged a sit-in in the judging room\" as deliberations dragged on for five hours.\n\nMargaret Atwood, the bookies' favorite to win the Booker Prize again for \"The Testaments,\" wound up in a tie for the 2019 award with British author Bernardine Evaristo after judges refused to choose one of them.

It might have looked like science fiction back in the day . Now it looks more politically urgent than ever before.\"\n\nEvaristo, who is of Anglo-Nigerian heritage, is the first black woman to take the trophy.\n\n\"I hope that honor doesn't last too long,\" she said.\n\nShe has published seven previous books but is less known than her co-winner.\n\nFlorence said he wasn't worried Evaristo, 60, would be overlooked as people focused on Atwood. He said that \"there is something utterly magical\" about the 12 characters from many walks of life who narrate \"Girl, Woman, Other.\"\n\n\"They give a wonderful spectrum of black British women today,\" he said. \"In that sense this book is ground-breaking \u2014 and I hope encouraging and inspiring to the rest of the publishing industry.\"\n\nFounded in 1969, the prize is open to English-language authors from around the world. It has been split between two winners twice before, most recently in 1992, when Michael Ondaatje's \"The English Patient\" and Barry Unsworth's \"Sacred Hunger\" shared the trophy. The rules were changed after that to stipulate there can only be one winner each year.\n\nJudges chose the two winners from a six-book shortlist that included British-Turkish author Elif Shafak's Istanbul-set \"10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World\"; U.S.-British writer Lucy Ellmann's stream-of-consciousness novel \"Ducks, Newburyport\"; India-born British writer Salman Rushdie's modern-day Don Quixote story, \"Quichotte\"; and \"An Orchestra of Minorities,\" a saga of love and exile by Nigeria's Chigozie Obioma.\n\nThe prize, which often delivers a big boost in sales and profile to the winner, was sponsored for 18 years by investment firm Man Group and was known as the Man Booker Prize. This year it reverted to its original name, the Booker Prize, under a new sponsor: the Crankstart Foundation, founded by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Michael Moritz and his wife, writer Harriet Heyman.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/15/margaret-atwood-and-bernardine-evaristo-share-fictions-booker-prize/3982283002/", "description": "Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo split the Booker Prize on Monday, after the judges ripped up the rulebook and refused to name one winner.", "authors": ["Jill Lawless", "Associated Press", "John Sandford", "Rachel Maddow", "Delia Owens", "Stephen King", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Published A.M.
