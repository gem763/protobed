(Burhan Ozbilici/AP)\n\nThe furor over the decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria began late Sunday night with a poorly conceived White House statement about an ominous telephone conversation between President Trump and the Turkish president.\n\nThe results have been rapid and remain unpredictable \u2014 and, in the view of critics, amount to the abandonment of America\u2019s Syrian Kurdish allies to a massive Turkish military assault.\n\nAs Turkish forces hovered on the Syrian border Tuesday, U.S. officials said the attack could come within hours. On Twitter, Trump wrote that the United States had provided arms for the Kurds and warned that any \u201cunforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s vice president responded that his country would \u201cnot react to threats.\u201d\n\nThe call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan started out with good news, according to U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive communication and other developments. Trump summed up several U.S. incentives that had been discussed with Ankara in recent weeks as ways of improving a tattered bilateral relationship. They included a $100 billion trade deal, a solution to a ban on Turkey\u2019s contributions to and purchases of the U.S.-made F-35 fighter jet, and a White House visit by Erdogan.\n\n[Syrian Kurds see American betrayal and warn fight against ISIS is now in doubt]\n\nThe two also discussed a U.S.-Turkey agreement, recently implemented, to jointly patrol a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northeast Syria along the Turkish border, cleared of the Kurdish force to which Ankara objected.\n\nTo Washington, the Kurds were indispensable fighters in the war against the Islamic State.\n\nTo Turkey, they were terrorists allied with Turkish Kurds seeking autonomy through violence, and the safe-zone agreement was too little, too late. Erdogan told Trump that his troops, massed on the border for months, were ready to move. It\u2019s not clear how Trump responded to the troubling warning.\n\nThe White House statement, issued about an hour before midnight Sunday, said that \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria.\u201d U.S. forces, it said, \u201cwill not support or be involved in the operation\u201d and would withdraw from the area.\n\nThere was no mention of the Kurds.\n\n\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebel fighters head to an area near the Turkish border north of Aleppo.

Republican leaders, awakening to news accounts focused on the withdrawal announcement, denounced Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds and kowtowing to Turkey. Pentagon officials struggled with explanations, humanitarian workers warned of civilian casualties, and Kurdish commanders said they would abandon the Syrian prisons where they were holding thousands of captured Islamic State fighters and head for the front lines against Turkey.\n\nTrump defended the withdrawal with a dawn tweetstorm, saying that \u201cit is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars.\u201d\n\nNational security aides \u2014 most of whom had not seen the call announcement the night before \u2014 quickly mobilized to repair the damage, and the presidential tone changed.\n\nAt 10:38 a.m. on Monday, a new Trump tweet warned that if Turkey did anything Trump didn\u2019t like, \u201cI will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the president switched to tweeted carrots and back to sticks again in the space of 30 minutes, first reminding Turkey of the incentives package addressing a long list of accumulated Turkish grievances.\n\nU.S. sanctions and tariffs have affected Turkey over a range of issues, including its dealings with Iran and Venezuela. Erdogan has economic and political problems, some of which he blames on Washington.\n\nNATO member Turkey\u2019s resentment over what it considered insufficient U.S. and European concern about the threat it faced from the civil war in neighboring Syria led it to purchase Russia\u2019s S-400 air defense system, a violation of both U.S. law and alliance protocols. In response, the administration expelled Turkey from the F-35 program \u2014 a consortium of nations in which Turkey\u2019s defense and steel industry profited by providing aircraft parts. The United States also canceled Turkey\u2019s purchase of more than 100 of the planes.\n\n[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria angers, worries Europeans]\n\nTrump hinted broadly Tuesday that the problems could be rectified. \u201cSo many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cin fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter jet. . . . Also remember, and importantly, that Turkey is an important member in good standing of NATO. [Erdogan] is coming to the U.S. as my guest on November 13th.\u201d\n\nCovering a broad swath of ground and many audiences, Trump made his first mention of the Kurds in another tweet moments later. \u201cIn no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLikewise our relationship with Turkey, a NATO and Trading partner, has been very good.\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, however, he reverted to warning about devastation to the Turkish economy.\n\nThe piecemeal announcements appear to have added to the widespread criticism that administration policy on Turkey, as on many foreign fronts, is in disarray.\n\n\u201cThe president is doing a good job, in his own way,\u201d said a senior U.S. official familiar with the twists and turns on Turkey this week. He had done, in the call, everything that was expected of him, the official said \u2014 discussing the incentives and expressing concern about any invasion.\n\n\u201cEverything you\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re doing in kind of a Wild West way with his tweets is more or less what he put on the table in a rational manner on the Sunday\u201d call, the official said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do two things,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe want to move forward\u201d with a major package of incentives to repair the U.S.-Turkey relationship. \u201cBut we cannot have a disaster in northeast Syria.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey\u2019s Defense Ministry wrote Tuesday on Twitter that its preparations for the operation were complete.\n\nU.S. military officials said American forces in Syria, including about 50 Special Operations troops who have now been repositioned outside the safe zone, were waiting to see the extent of Turkey\u2019s offensive to assess how the overall U.S. mission there would be affected.\n\nOutside experts have cautioned that a large-scale Turkish operation, if it precipitated a security breakdown at prisons holding Islamic State militants, could prompt a larger U.S. withdrawal from Syria. The American presence, which includes about 1,000 troops in northeast Syria, is a lean force dispersed across a number of bases.\n\nAn administration official said Mazloum Kobane Abdi, the commander of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Force, sent a message to U.S. forces in Syria saying he knew that the recent decisions were not theirs and that they would always be brothers.\n\n\u201cTo say the military is very angry about this is an understatement,\u201d the official said.\n\nOfficials said they were uncertain whether Turkish forces would conduct a symbolic feint inside the border \u2014 which they said could enable the U.S. troops to return to reactivate the safe zone \u2014 or would force their way deeper into Syria.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, the Islamic State sought to take advantage of the focus on the border to the north by staging an attack shortly before 2 a.m. in the group\u2019s former capital, Raqqa, according to a statement from the SDF. Three suicide bombers attacked SDF military positions in the city and a gun battle erupted with an unknown number of militants nearby, the statement said.\n\nAs allies and regional actors try to unscramble the president\u2019s conflicting statements, Erdogan\u2019s government has remained on message, insisting that the invasion is a certainty and that its target, the SDF, is an imminent threat to Turkey\u2019s national security.\n\nSabah, a Turkish newspaper that is close to Erdogan\u2019s government, published a report Tuesday describing how the battle might unfold. It said Turkish armed forces would wait for the full withdrawal of U.S. troops before commencing any operation. Warplanes and howitzers would pound enemy positions, and then Turkish troops would enter Syria from several points along the border, east of the Euphrates River.\n\nThe military would advance as far as 18 miles into Syrian territory, the report said, without naming its source. After the operation was completed, Turkey would \u201ccontinue its humanitarian work to bring back locals in the area.\u201d\n\nFahim reported from Istanbul.
