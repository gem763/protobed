(AP) - Joaquin Niemann was an 18-year-old amateur when he arrived in West Virginia two years ago and tied for 29th in the only PGA Tour event he played outside of the U.S. Open.\n\nIn 2018, he improved to a tie for fifth at the tournament.\n\nNow he has a chance to become the first player from Chile to win on tour.\n\nNiemann shot a 2-under 68 on Saturday to take a two-stroke lead in A Military Tribute at the Greenbrier.\n\nThe 20-year-old Niemann was 15 under with a round left in the season-opening event at the Old White TPC.\n\n\u201cI just feel like I\u2019m almost a member here,\u201d Niemann said. \u201cI just like being out here. Always when you play on a course that you know already it helps a lot. I think this is the course I have played more on tour.\u201d\n\nNiemann had a bogey and three birdies, including a 4-foot putt on the par-5 17th.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really happy the way I\u2019ve been playing,\u201d Niemann said. \u201cThis course is really good for me.\u201d\n\nNo third-round leader has gone on to win the tournament.\n\nNate Lashley, Richy Werenski and Robby Shelton were tied for second at 13 under. Lashley and Werenski shot 65, and Shelton had a 70.\n\nAdam Long and Scotty Scheffler were 12 under. Long shot 70, and Scheffler had a 71.\n\nLashley\u2019s story is well known by now. In 2004 his parents and girlfriend were killed in a plane crash in Wyoming. After resuming his career in the PGA Tour\u2019s minor leagues, he won his first tour title at the inaugural Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit in June after slipping into the field as an alternate.\n\n\u201cMy mentality is I\u2019m definitely a lot more relaxed,\u201d Lashley said. \u201cI\u2019m just playing, just trying to take that as experience, the way I played in Detroit. You know, I really just kind of kept to myself that week and really just focused and tried to block everything else out. I feel like I\u2019ve done a good job of that so far.\u201d\n\nLashley made bogeys after finding the rough on the par-4 11th and the greenside bunker on the par-3 15th. He chipped in for eagle from 36 feet at No. 17.\n\nHis tee shot on the 179-yard 18th came as thunderstorms arrived in the area and play was suspended for about 50 minutes. Upon returning, Lashley three-putted from 70 feet.\n\nWerensky finished No. 126 in the FedEx Cup standings last season, one spot from qualifying for the playoffs. He got his PGA Tour card back for this season in the Korn Ferry Tour Finals.\n\nWerensky said that he didn\u2019t get discouraged after missing the playoffs. Heading into the Korn Ferry Finals, \u201cI had like a, I don\u2019t want to say an epiphany, but just like, \u2018Hey, man just chill out. Relax. I know I\u2019m good enough.\u201d\n\nShelton was tied for the lead with Niemann and Scheffler after the second round. Shelton was 2 over for the day until making birdies at the par-5 12th and par-4 14th.\n\nHe hopes to use his two wins on the Korn Ferry Tour last season to help stay calm Sunday.\n\n\u201cYou got to be super patient,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard to do, but hopefully I can manage my nerves tomorrow.\u201d\n\nKevin Chappell couldn\u2019t capitalize on the 11-under 59 he shot Friday, the 11th sub-60 round in tour history. He had a 73 on Saturday and was eight strokes behind Niemann.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joaquin Niemann was an 18-year-old amateur when he arrived in West Virginia two years ago and tied for 29th in the only PGA Tour event he played outside of the U.S. Open.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/greenbrier_golf_65528_c0-125-3001-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f004afff785dabb7c63f295a05af776e2e42481e", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
