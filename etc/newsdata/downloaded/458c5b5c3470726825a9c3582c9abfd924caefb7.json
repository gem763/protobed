There wasn\u2019t a whole lot of [fun]. He made it fun for this team.\u201d\n\nIn the age of analytics, dancing in the dugout after home runs or eating together in the clubhouse cafeteria before games doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to winning.\n\nBut Parra\u2019s exuberance \u2014 along with the outgoing personalities of fellow Venezuelans Anibal Sanchez and Asdrubal Cabrera, and the swagger of the Nationals\u2019 two young stars from the Dominican Republic, Victor Robles and Juan Soto \u2014 helped rescue the 2019 Nationals, who play Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday against either the Houston Astros or the New York Yankees.\n\n\u201cSanchy and Parra and all of our Latin guys, what they can do, they just bring an energy, just a personality that we just rallied around,\u201d Max Scherzer said as the team celebrated sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series on Tuesday night. \u201cIt just became contagious, and everybody had a hand in it. One thing led up to another, and just our clubhouse shenanigans and the way we can just have fun together.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest thing, is that this team plays for each other and has fun together.\u201d\n\nOf course it helps that some of the team\u2019s Venezuelan- and Dominican-born players are also playing out of their minds.\n\nSanchez had a no-hitter broken up after seven innings of Game 1 of the NLCS. Soto has nine hits, two home runs and seven RBIs this postseason. Robles returned from a hamstring injury that caused him to miss more than a week of the playoffs and blasted a solo home run in Game 3.\n\nConversely, Parra doesn\u2019t crack the lineup much anymore. During May and June, the 32-year-old was crucial for Washington as a stopgap in the outfield and at first base while other players dealt with injuries. Now his role is more about what he does off the field than on it \u2014 though he did pinch-hit in Game 4, ripping a single to right for his first hit of the postseason.\n\nMartinez joked that he sent Parra in to pinch-hit only \u201cto get the fans going again.\u201d\n\nParra became an unlikely phenomenon among Nationals fans when he changed his walk-up music \u2014 the track played over Nationals Park speakers when a player comes up to bat \u2014 to the popular children\u2019s song \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d His young daughter loved the song, and when Parra was swiping through music on his phone looking for something new, the earworm kept coming up.\n\nMost big leaguers, suffice to say, do not swagger up to the plate with children\u2019s music blaring in the background, but Parra sees things differently. His approach to baseball, and life, is based on a simple philosophy: Keep it upbeat.\n\n\u201cStay positive. Just be happy every day, believe in myself,\u201d Parra said. \u201cWe have a great team. Be happy every time.\u201d\n\nWhile fans grew to love \u201cParra Shark,\u201d as the craze became known, Parra turned the clubhouse culture inside out in other ways. He got the Nationals dancing to celebrate home runs. The type of dance was left up to the hitter. He pumped energetic music \u2014 usually Latin dance or electronic music \u2014 through the clubhouse speakers.\n\nMartinez recounted one point during the season when Parra was slumping at the plate. It affected his energy. Parra didn\u2019t feel he was helping the team anymore.\n\n\u201cI go, \u2018No no no no,\u2019\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re 2 for 100; your job is to bring the energy every single day. That\u2019s who you are.\u2019 I said, \u2018You play that music loud. You pump up the guys\u2019 \u2026 and he just looked at me and he goes, \u2018You\u2019re right.\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019m not doing my job.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more than Parra\u2019s job now. When the Nationals clinched a postseason berth Sept. 24, Sanchez was blowing a whistle at the front of a conga line that slithered throughout the clubhouse. When Stephen Strasburg left the mound in Game 3 of the NLCS, Parra greeted him with a hug \u2014 and Sanchez joined in behind him, no matter how awkward it made the usually stoic ace feel.\n\n\u201cThe group hug, yeah, that\u2019s GP and Sanchy,\u201d Adam Eaton said. \u201cThey\u2019re touchy-feely. It\u2019s nice. They like trying to make Stras feel as uncomfortable as possible. It\u2019s great. When Stras is uncomfortable, good things happen, so we love it.\u201d\n\nThe energy has been undeniably infectious and has rubbed off on the American-born players in several ways.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing Strasburg dancing salsa, Scherzer dancing merengue. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Johnny DiPuglia, Nationals vice president of international scouting, told NBC Sports Washington. \u201cBefore, when you would go in there and speak Spanish, people would look at you like a UFO. Now, you have to know some words of Spanish just to fit in. I think it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n\nScherzer showed off his Spanish skills after the Nationals won Game 4 of the NLDS when he and Ryan Zimmerman were asked a loaded question about having a team full of veterans.\n\n\u201cYeah, we joke about that. We\u2019re a bunch of viejos,\u201d Scherzer said, using the Spanish word for \u201cold men,\u201d though MLB\u2019s official transcript decided he said \u201cyahoos.\u201d\n\nWhatever language the players want to speak, and however they want to celebrate, something is clearly working. Entering the World Series, the Nationals have won 16 of their past 18 games dating back to the regular season.\n\nAs Anthony Rendon recently put it, \u201cWe have taken our victory party to a whole new level.\u201d\n\n\u2981 David Driver and Matthew Paras contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
