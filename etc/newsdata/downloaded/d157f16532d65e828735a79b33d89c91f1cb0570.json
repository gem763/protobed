He said Labour first needed to take no-deal Brexit off the table - and that, he suggested, means full-blown amendments to the Prime Minister's Brexit Bill.\n\nMeanwhile, er, the right-wing Tory PM threatened to go on strike.\n\nSo what on earth is going on?\n\nHere's what has happened tonight and what happens now.\n\nWhat did Boris Johnson announce?\n\n(Image: Chris J Ratcliffe)\n\nFirst, let\u2019s set the scene. This all comes after MPs voted down Boris Johnson\u2019s bid to rush his whole Brexit deal through the Commons in three days. That, in turn, forced him to accept a likely Brexit delay from the EU.\n\nBoris Johnson said he\u2019ll allow Parliament more time to scrutinise his Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Bill - which, despite losing on the timetable, passed its first hurdle in the Commons earlier this week.\n\nThat would allow MPs some time to tackle problems in the 110-page Bill, which puts the Brexit deal into law.\n\nThose problems include on workers' rights, a border down the Irish Sea and crucially a 'trapdoor' to no-deal Brexit - which could allow it by default in 2021.\n\nBut his offer of more time came at a price.\n\nThe Prime Minister said he would only agree to a new timetable if two-thirds of all MPs (434) vote in favour of holding an election on Monday night.\n\nHe wants to hold that election on December 12, which would mean dissolving Parliament after the end of the day on November 6.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nOn Friday, EU leaders are expected to decide whether to grant a Brexit extension to the UK - and for how long. In all likelihood, they\u2019re expected to approve a delay of up to three months to January 31.\n\nOn Monday MPs will vote on whether to hold an early election under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act (FTPA).\n\nIt requires a fixed threshold of two-thirds of MPs to back it - 434 votes in total. In other words, it can't pass without at least some Labour support.\n\nIf the bid for an election passes, MPs will be offered until Parliament is dissolved on November 6 to scrutinise Boris Johnson\u2019s Withdrawal Bill.\n\nThis leaves just a week and a half. Mr Johnson offered to extend Commons hours with \"Fridays, weekends, the earliest starts and the latest finishes\" as Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg vowed: \"We are willing to work 24 hours a day\".\n\nBut it's much, much less time than Labour asked for.\n\nThen there\u2019s a five week campaign leading up to an election on December 12.\n\nWill Labour back an election?\n\nIt looks like they could kill off the bid for an election - but we don't know for sure yet.\n\nOh really? So what's going on with Labour?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOK, so. A few things have happened here.\n\nFirst of all, whips instructed Labour MPs to abstain in the vote on Monday - or vote against if they want to.\n\nIn an election vote, this is basically the same thing because what counts is getting 434 MPs to vote FOR - otherwise, an election doesn't happen.\n\nYet then, a short time later, Jeremy Corbyn suggested that this decision wasn't final.\n\nInstead, the Labour leader said, there would be a decision after 27 EU leaders announce on Friday whether they'll delay Brexit.\n\nHe said: \"The principle is take No Deal off the table, the EU answer tomorrow then we can decide.\"\n\nA Labour source later said the whip was a \"holding\" decision that could change in certain circumstances. However, the source could not explain what those circumstances are. One MP dismissed this as \"absolutely not true\".\n\nJeremy Corbyn insisted: \"There's no confusion at all.\"\n\nWhy are Labour poised to kill off the election?\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLabour have always said they'll back an election once the threat of no-deal Brexit is off the table.\n\nThe key problem is, the definition of \"the threat of no-deal Brexit\" changes from one person to another.\n\nIt always used to mean once EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit until January 31 - something they're now preparing to do.\n\nBut Labour now says the definition includes the \"trapdoor to no-deal\" in 2021 that's bound up in Boris Johnson's Brexit Bill.\n\nUnder the \"trapdoor\" clause, MPs won't get the chance to demand an extension to the Brexit transition period if the government doesn't want Parliament to have a say. That could mean Britain crashing out on 31 December 2020.\n\nJeremy Corbyn said: \"No deal is a threat that Boris Johnson has been using all along, and indeed it\u2019s included in his legislation that\u2019s before Parliament at the moment, the legislation that he\u2019s paused.\n\n\"I want us to not crash out of the EU because of all the damage it will do to jobs across this country.\"\n\nAre Labour split on this?\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nYes.\n\nCorbyn-backing group Momentum swung behind an election saying \"bring it on\" - but dozens of MPs were poised to vote against an election no matter what.\n\nSome shadow cabinet ministers including Jeremy Corbyn met between Commons votes as the drama unfolded.\n\nOne source said those present were \"unanimous\" that they shouldn't \"play Johnson's game\".\n\nThey added: \u201cHe wants to bounce the Bill through with a no-deal trapdoor intact and get a general election where he hopes to be able to push that button afterwards\".\n\nBut a second source later said that was \"completely wrong\" because shadow ministers were \"far from unanimous\".\n\nAnd it was not a full meeting of shadow cabinet as several key members were not there - including Tom Watson, Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, Shami Chakrabarti and chair Ian Lavery.\n\nWill other parties back an election?\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSo far, only the DUP have said they would back the election vote.\n\nThe SNP say they won\u2019t vote for it, and would instead press for a vote of no confidence in the PM.\n\nThe Lib Dems say they want to see what the EU\u2019s offer of a delay looks like today (FRI) before committing to a poll. Leader Jo Swinson said: \"We're not in the business of bailing out Boris Johnson\".\n\nPlaid Cymru say their priority is a referendum on the terms of the deal.\n\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas warned there must not be an election until a \"trapdoor to no-deal\" in 2021 is closed in the Bill. \"I hope MPs will oppose this dangerous and cynical manoeuvre,\" she declared.\n\nSNP MP Pete Wishart accused the Prime Minister of trying to \"play games\". He said: \"We will not be pushed today by this Prime Minister. He might be hoping the electorate will fall for his con tricks but the SNP certainly will not!\"\n\nWhat happens if MPs don't back an election?\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENTARY RECORDING UNIT HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe Prime Minister's spokesman has suggested Boris Johnson will leave his Withdrawal Agreement Bill on ice if he loses the election vote - effectively going on strike.\n\nThe spokesman told The Sun: \"Nothing will come before Parliament but the bare minimum.\n\n\"We will pursue a general election every day from then onwards, and do everything we can to get it.\"\n\nMr Johnson said he would \u201ccampaign every day and at every opportunity for a general election.\u201d But after that, it\u2019s unclear.\n\nHe has other ways to trigger a general election before Christmas, outlined below, but they're all fraught with their own problems.\n\nHe could resign - admitting failure - and make way for a new leader. Or he could actually try to get his Brexit Bill through the Commons before January 31.\n\nHow is a general election called?\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nThere are two main ways to call an early general election before 2023 - and Boris Johnson is opting for the first one below.\n\nThe first is to get two-thirds of all MPs in the entire House of Commons to back one under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. This requires 434 MPs - so for example, that could be all Tory MPs and all but about 100 Labour MPs. Boris Johnson tried this twice in September and failed both times.\n\nThe second is for the government to lose a vote of no confidence. The vote can be brought by Jeremy Corbyn and won by a simple majority (half of everyone who votes). This takes longer because before an election is triggered, there's a 14-day window where smaller parties can jostle to form a caretaker government.\n\nThere's a third way if Labour is refusing to back an election. This is for the government to bring a one-line Bill repealing the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. The advantage is it only needs simple majorities to pass. But it takes longer and MPs can table amendments - such as forcing votes at age 16 or a second referendum.\n\nWhy does Boris Johnson want an election?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe PM has a majority of minus 45 so Parliament has repeatedly thwarted his plans.\n\nFrom rushing his Brexit plan through the Commons in three days, to withholding secret no-deal Brexit plans, to, er, having an election, the Prime Minister's schemes have been voted down at almost every turn.\n\nWith several polls putting the Tories more than 10 points ahead of Labour, the Prime Minister believes he can win back a Commons majority by fighting a whole election on the ticket of \"delivering Brexit\".\n\nHe renewed calls for an election as the EU prepared to delay the Brexit deadline by three months to January 31.\n\nThe PM tried to characterise the delay - which breaks his own promises to the people - as Parliament's fault saying an election is needed to break the deadlock.\n\nCan EU citizens vote in a general election?\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nNo.\n\nEU citizens living in the UK can register to vote, and can vote in the following:\n\nEuropean Parliament elections (though you have to fill out a form called UC1 to prove you're not also voting in another country).\n\n(though you have to fill out a form called UC1 to prove you're not also voting in another country). Council elections\n\nPolice and Crime Commissioners\n\nLondon mayoral and Assembly\n\nNorthern Ireland and Welsh Assemblies and Scottish Parliament\n\nBut EU citizens cannot vote in UK Parliament elections - a general election - unless they are citizens of the Republic of Ireland, Cyprus or Malta. For more information click here.\n\nWhen is the register to vote deadline?\n\nIt is always 12 working days before polling day. So if there's an election on December 12, it will be on November 26.\n\nWhat does an election mean for the Brexit deal?\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit deal has been agreed by EU leaders and stands, regardless of an election, ready to be agreed.\n\nThe Bill to implement the deal is a different kettle of fish. It's passed its first hurdle in the House of Commons - meaning it is still active and in progress until the moment Parliament is dissolved for an election.\n\nIf it's completed before that election, then it becomes the law of the land. A future government can unpick it one way or the other, to make it harder or softer, but this could be a long and difficult process.\n\nIf it gets snarled up and doesn't get Royal Assent before November 7, then it falls away - and MPs' hard work will go to nothing.\n\nA new PM would then have to come back, legally, from Square One with a new Bill when they open the new Parliament.\n\nBut it's not at Square One in a political sense because the deal is already agreed with the EU and a Bill is already written.\n\nIf the Tories win, there is nothing to stop them bringing back the same Bill word-for-word to a more Brexity House of Commons.", "description": "Boris Johnson has made his third bid for an election - and Jeremy Corbyn is poised to block it.
