We carefully review accounts to ensure our services are used in line with our acceptable use policy and take action as appropriate,\u201d a PayPal spokesperson told BBC News.\n\n\u201cWe do not allow PayPal services to be used to promote hate, violence, or other forms of intolerance that are discriminatory,\u201d the company added.\n\nThe account now says it\u2019s \u201cunable to receive money.\u201d\n\nNandini Jammi, a member of the social media activism group Sleeping Giants, said she found the account while searching on Google for examples of PayPal\u2019s \u201calarmingly common\u201d support of white supremacist groups.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tracking hate groups on PayPal for several months now,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cI was just Googling for a new example and I kind of knew all I had to do was type in KKK.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some examples of them acting in a fairly timely manner, but they\u2019re not applying [their anti-hate policy] in a consistent enough manner,\u201d she added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
