The so-called bond king said yields won't go any lower this year.\n\n\"It's not a great idea to bet on low interest rates,\" Gundlach said in an investor webcast on Tuesday. When asked if he would buy 10-year Treasury now, Gundlach said \"absolutely not.\"\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury breached below 1.5% in August, while the 30-year Treasury bond yield fell below 2% for the first time ever as the U.S.-China trade war escalated.\n\nThe Federal Reserve conducted a repurchase operation Tuesday involving $53 billion worth of various debt instruments as it seeks to control the level of its benchmark interest rate. Gundlach said the central bank will see the \"repo\" move as a \"warning sign\" and will resume expansion of its balance sheet.\n\n\"The freeze-up can only be viewed as a negative,\" Gundlach said. \"They are baby-stepping their way to doing QE.\"\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee will announce their decision on interest rates on Wednesday. Gundlach said he expects the Fed to cut rates by a quarter point.\n\nGundlach, a respected markets forecaster, oversees $130 billion of assets under management at DoubleLine, according to its website.", "description": "DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach believes the bottom for interest rates is in for 2019.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105914423-1557923997469nup_186903_1493.jpg?v=1557924050", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
