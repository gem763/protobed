The ride is supposed to have been tethered to the ground with a harness to ensure the tourists go no higher than 164 feet. On this occasion, both mother and son died after the balloon burst in the air and they plummeted to their deaths\n\nHere tethers can be seen snapping as the pair shoot off into the sky forced up by the massive power of the helium balloon. The event happened at a crowded theme park called the Majiagou scenic area, which is near the city of Yantai in East China's Shandong Province\n\nThis picture was taken just before the balloon popped and the mother and son plunged back to earth where they died. Five organisers of the park were arrested by Chinese authorities\n\nAccording to reports, the experience - offered for free as part of an \u00a38 entrance fee to the park - allows tourists to reach heights of 164 feet.\n\nThe gas balloon should have gone no higher due to the tethers anchoring to the ground. Video later showed the mother and son floating away after the balloon slipped its moorings.\n\nThe pair are last seen alive as a tiny white speck in the sky as the balloon floats into the atmosphere.\n\nThe authorities said the helium balloon later ruptured in the sky, with Ms Suo and her tot falling to their deaths.\n\nThe type of gas balloon the mother and son were on before it burst and they plummeted to the ground at that Majiagou scenic area. The balloon rides were found to unauthorised and illegal\n\nYantai police announced the arrest of five organisers on 3rd October, with tourism activity at the national park having since been suspended pending a formal inquiry.\n\nA Majiagou scenic area staff member revealed to local media that the police had found the balloon rides to be unauthorised and illegal.\n\nThe park reportedly leases part of its grounds to the company for the activity, but it is unclear whether it also faces punishment for negligence as a result of the police's findings.\n\nIt was still unclear at the time of writing just how far Ms Suo and her son fell.", "description": "A mother and her three-year-old son died in China's Shandong province, after their helium balloon ride floated up into the sky and they plummeted to the ground when it burst.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19448394-0-image-a-30_1570547250077.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
