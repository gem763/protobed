That\u2019s a combination of jobs eliminated by firms struggling with tariffs and other elements of the trade war, and jobs that would have been created but haven\u2019t because of reduced economic activity.\n\nThe firm\u2019s chief economist, Mark Zandi, told Yahoo Finance that the job toll from the trade war will hit about 450,000 by the end of the year, if there\u2019s no change in policy. By the end of 2020, the trade war will have killed 900,000 jobs, on its current course. The hardest-hit sectors are manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and retail.\n\nOther data back up the Moody\u2019s Analytics numbers. Employers have created 1.3 million jobs so far this year, down from 1.9 million during the same period in 2018. The manufacturing sector has actually contracted, with many producers struggling with higher prices caused by Trump\u2019s tariffs. Business investment is growing by the smallest amount since late 2016.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Finance.Yahoo.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
