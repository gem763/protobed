Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a 14-hour-long press conference on Thursday.\n\nZelensky started the \"marathon\" press conference from 10 am local time and took the last questions shortly after midnight.\n\nThe event was held at a food court in central Kiyv, with groups of reporters taking turn asking the newly-elected Ukrainian leader questions.\n\nAccording to Zelensky's spokesperson, Iulia Mendel, 300 domestic and foreign journalists attended the conference, asking about 500 questions.\n\nApproximately eight hours into the event, a representative for the Ukrainian National Records Agency stood up to announce the record, which was previously held by Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko. It has not yet been verified by an international body.\n\nThe former actor, elected to the highest office in his country in April, expressed surprise at the record and said that he disliked awards because he is \"modest\".\n\nZelensky said he prepared for what he knew would be a long event by having injections to strengthen his vocal cords.\n\nHe answered questions on the conflict in eastern Ukraine, relations with Russia and the telephone conversation with his American counterpart Donald Trump which had led to the Democratic party launching impeachment proceedings against the US President.", "description": "Zelensky started the \"marathon\" press conference from 10:00 am local time and took the last questions shortly after midnight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/41/58/1000x563_cmsv2_846e7551-a8da-5b2b-9023-1403b331f7a0-4224158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
