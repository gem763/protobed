Was he shoved? \u2014 the least interesting is the question of who will succeed him on the parapet .\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely to matter much. Regardless of who has advised Mr. Trump on foreign affairs \u2014 generals and corporate tycoons, seasoned pros and amateurs \u2014 all have proved powerless before a zest for chaos that would have thwarted George Marshall.\n\nEven when Mr. Trump has pursued worthy goals \u2014 trying to persuade North Korea\u2019s dictator to give up his nuclear weapons, negotiating with the Taliban so American troops can leave Afghanistan \u2014 his mercurial, impatient, crisis-driven approach has often backfired, no matter who was advising him.\n\nHis naming of Mr. Bolton as national security adviser in March 2018 was itself an instance of Trumpian chaos. Mr. Trump wanted to pursue an end to hostilities in Korea and Afghanistan and proved wary of conflict in Iran and Venezuela. Yet he chose a proponent of belligerence who disdains diplomacy, supports allies-be-damned unilateralism and thinks bombing North Korea and Iran is the best way to neutralize their nuclear threat.", "description": "No matter who advises this president, chaos will reign.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/opinion/10boltonout-illo/10boltonout-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
