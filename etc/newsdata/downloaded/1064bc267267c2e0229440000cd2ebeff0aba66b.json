Instead, they suspended Mansmann, which prompted a protest (pictured) on Monday\n\nDuring the protest, the students were seen holding signs that read, 'believe women' and 'don't write off rape'\n\nIn response to the suspensions, Mansmann and the two students were joined by about three dozen students from the high school on Monday to protest the disciplinary actions against them.\n\nShe told WMTW: 'It was in protest of these suspensions, but more importantly, in support of all the survivors.'\n\nDuring the protest, the students put forth a list of demands, including more education around what constitutes sexual assault and resources for students.\n\nThey were seen holding signs that read, 'believe women' and 'don't write off rape'.\n\nMansmann said it all began over the summer when she and other students had the opportunity to speak to the school board about the allegations.\n\n'I don't feel like the response of the school was thorough. That is why we had gone to the school board meeting last June to express our concerns,' Mansmann said.\n\nMansmann (left in June and right at the protest) said it all began over the summer when she and other students had the opportunity to speak to the school board about the allegations\n\n'I don't feel like the response of the school was thorough.

A DailyMail.com request for comment to Superintendent Donna Wolfrom was not immediately returned\n\nThe school's alleged lack of action prompted her to post the sticky notes in the bathroom.\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, Superintendent Donna Wolfrom said: 'The Cape Elizabeth Schools have never disciplined a student for advocating for their peers or their views on cultural, social and political matters.\n\n'It is important to understand, however, that when a student\u2019s speech bullies another student, we are required by law and by School Board policy to investigate and take prompt action, even if that same student has also spoken out on a matter of public concern.\n\nWolfrom said that she is unable to comment on the specific student matter recently reported in the press 'because of confidentiality laws'.\n\n'But we can say that we are confident that the matter was exhaustively investigated and that we took the action that law and policy require,' she added.\n\nSchool officials said the district responded to the concerns in June.\n\nAn amended sexual assault policy will be heard at Tuesday's school board meeting.\n\nIt's unclear who, if anyone, is being investigated for sexual assault.", "description": "Aela Mansmann (pictured), 15, who posted sticky notes in the bathroom of Cape Elizabeth High School in Maine warning others about a rapist on campus, has been suspended for bullying.", "authors": ["Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19449042-0-image-a-62_1570548252430.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
