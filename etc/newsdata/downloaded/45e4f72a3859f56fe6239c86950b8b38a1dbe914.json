Facebook/Cheerin Tan, Courtesy of Sunil Sandhu\u2019s family\n\nTwo Singaporeans \u2013 a 26-year-old postgraduate student and a 46-year-old researcher \u2013 are believed to have died in a boat fired that claimed 34 lives on Monday (September 2).\n\nAccording to The Straits Times, student Tan Wei and Sunil Singh Sandhu were both asleep below deck, along with 28 other passengers, when the fire broke out at 3.30am.\n\nOn Wednesday, Business Insider reported that 20 bodies had been recovered, while the search for the remaining victims \u2013 all presumed dead \u2013 had been suspended.\n\nThe Straits Times on Thursday night reported that all but one body had been recovered. As the bodies were badly burnt, authorities are identifying them with a DNA analysis tool usually used in war zones.\n\nBoat was on Labour Day excursion\n\nThe boat, named Conception, was carrying 39 passengers and crew at the time of the fire. It had been chartered for a three-day excursion over the Labour Day weekend in the US.\n\nThe cause of fire is not known at this point.\n\nIn another report, Business Insider quoted the sheriff of Santa Barbara as saying that the 75-foot vessel was in \u201cthe worst-case scenario\u201d as it was in the open sea in the middle of the night, when most people were sleeping.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the people were the passengers on the ship, and the sleeping compartment was on the bottom deck of the ship, so they would have been sound asleep when this fire started.\n\n\u201cSo you can imagine of all scenarios, to be in a remote location, have a fire that occurs, have limited if any fire fighting capabilities that could address that, and then to all the sudden have a fire that spread very very rapidly, you couldn\u2019t ask for a worse situation,\u201d sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\nSingaporeans were working in the US\n\nThe Straits Times said Tan Wei was a graduate from the Master of Engineering course at UC Berkeley, specialising in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, and worked as a data scientist at a tech company in Santa Barbara.\n\nThe New Paper said Sunil Sandhu had lived and worked in the US for over 20 years and only recently took up scuba diving.\n\nTan Wei\u2019s sister confirmed her death in a Facebook announcement, while Sunil Sandhu\u2019s parents confirmed the news in an interview with The New Paper.\n\nSurvivors went back to find others\n\nAccording to earlier reports, five crew members \u2013 who were above deck at the time \u2013 managed to escape the fire by jumping into a rescue dinghy and paddling to a nearby yacht. They then banged on the yacht\u2019s hull until its owners woke up.\n\nThey were then given blankets and sweaters as some of them were only wearing their underwear. One of them had a broken leg, ABC News 7 reported.\n\nTwo of the survivors paddled back to the boat to look for survivors, but were unable to find anyone, the LA Times reported.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Tan Wei and Sunil Singh Sandhu were both asleep below deck when the fire broke out at 3.30am.
