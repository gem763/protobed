(Photo: Jonathan Hession, USA Network)\n\nAny fan of \"The Bourne Identity\" film franchise knows that Treadstone is the CIA black-ops program that produced Matt Damon's amnesiac super-assassin, Jason Bourne.\n\nUSA Network's \"Treadstone,\" which premieres Tuesday, takes that nightmarish operation and all of its unexpected consequences to the small screen, charting the brainwashing program from its beginnings in the 1970s to a shocking present-day reawakening.\n\nViewers won't see Bourne (or Damon), but there are plenty of fingerprints connecting the 10-episode action thriller (Tuesdays, 10 EDT/PDT) to the five feature films \u2013 four starring Damon and one featuring Jeremy Renner as another turbocharged operative \u2013 and to the novels of Robert Ludlum, who created the iconic character.\n\n\"Treadstone as an organization did give birth to Jason Bourne,\" executive producer Ben Smith says of a story \u2013 and undercover program \u2013 that bears familiar \"Bourne\" traits of international intrigue, unceasing duplicity and plenty of hand-to-hand combat. But it takes the saga in a new direction.\n\nTorrent of television: Fall TV premiere dates 2019: When your favorite show returns, and your next one starts\n\nMatt Damon, who played the title character in 2016's \"Jason Bourne,\" helped transform Robert Ludlum's novels into a huge film franchise that is expanding into television \u2013 without the Bourne character \u2013 in USA Network's \"Treadstone.\" (Photo: Universal Pictures)\n\n\"The idea was (that) this is such a great sandbox. What else can we build in here?\" says Smith, a producer of the \"Bourne\" films.\n\nHere's where \"Treadstone\" parallels and diverges from the \"Bourne\" films and novels:\n\nPast threats, present troubles\n\n\"Treadstone\" lives in two timelines, exploring the Cold War origins of the secret, extralegal assassination program laid out in Ludlum's 1980 novel, \"The Bourne Identity,\" while dealing with its harsh repercussions today.\n\nIn 1973, J. Randolph Bentley (Jeremy Irvine), an early operative imprisoned in East Germany, struggles against competing Soviet mind-control efforts overseen by a ruthless KGB operative with the help of an ex-Nazi scientist.\n\nHe escapes, showing a resourcefulness that would make Bourne \u2013 as well as James Bond and MacGyver \u2013 proud, while struggling to figure out what happened to him. The initial plot parallels Damon's amnesiac character, who had recovered his memory by Damon's most recent appearance in 2016's \"Jason Bourne.\"\n\nFilm family: Review: Without memory problems, 'Jason Bourne' is forgettable\n\nEllen Becker (Michelle Forbes) is a CIA veteran trying to figure out why a group of highly skilled sleeper operatives have been activated in USA Network's Bourne-inspired 'Treadstone.' (Photo: Jonathan Hession, USA Network)\n\nIn the present day, the Treadstone project, shut down in the \"Bourne\" films, roars back to life, appearing to have spread beyond the CIA. \"It was bigger than we thought,\" one CIA boss says.\n\nBentley's highly trained Treadstone descendants, stationed all over the world, are waking from psychological slumber, getting involved in punishing fights and taking on dangerous assignments with skills they didn't know they had.\n\nA puzzled CIA officer (Michelle Forbes) tries to figure out why the sleeper agents, called cicadas because of their seeming hibernation, have been activated \u2013 and by whom.\n\nBourne-free\n\nSince \"Treadstone\" doesn't have the singular Bourne/Damon, it introduces a smorgasbord of undercover operatives \u2013 including a North Korean piano teacher who's a mom (Hyo-Joo Han), an oil-rig worker in Alaska (Brian J. Smith) and a waitress in India (Shruti Haasan) \u2013 who are jolted into action.\n\nA London cab driver (Tracy Ifeachor) \u2013 whose journalistic career was short-circuited after she reported on a missing Soviet-era nuclear missile \u2013 is drawn into action when the missile's whereabouts become newly relevant. She shows great skill evading North Korean killers during a Parisian car chase that pays homage to Bourne, even if she's not a Treadstone agent.\n\nCIA operative Matt Edwards (Omar Metwally) talks to investigative journalist-turned-cabbie Tar Coleman (Tracy Ifeachor) in USA Network's 'Treadstone.' (Photo: Jonathan Hession, USA Network)\n\n\"She's a taxi driver in London,\" Smith jokes, suggesting a different kind of exacting training.\n\nA worldwide perspective\n\n\"Treadstone\" continues the international outlook of the \"Bourne\" films and is set largely in visually rich European cities. Primary filming took place in Budapest, Hungary, but the series travels to Amsterdam, Paris, London, Greece, India, Africa, Taiwan, South Korea and Colombia, Smith says.\n\nExecutive producer Tim Kring created \"Heroes,\" and the far flung, ethnically diverse operatives of \"Treadstone\" may remind viewers of the 2006-10 NBC series, which followed people with superhuman abilities who popped up all over the world.\n\n\"The fact that he did create this global world within 'Heroes' was a super interesting and compelling reason for us to work together on 'Treadstone,' \" Smith says.\n\nSoYun Pak (Hyo-Joo Han) is a young mother and piano teacher with a shocking secret identity in USA Network's 'Treadstone.' (Photo: Jonathan Hession, USA Network)\n\nFight club expansion\n\n\"Treadstone\" picks up the \"Bourne\" fighting mantle in tightly edited, highly choreographed one-on-one battles.\n\nDamon's Jason Bourne was a one-man killing machine; fisticuffs here are equal opportunity as a diverse group shows off martial arts skills. In one episode, two middle-aged women gut punch age and gender stereotypes in a battle to the death.\n\n\"We took out the conventional thinking in terms of who can participate in a fight and had a lot of fun with that,\" Smith says.\n\nOil rig worker Doug McKenna (Brian J. Smith), right, is bowled over when he learns he has been part of a secret government program that creates super assassins in USA Network's 'Treadstone.' (Photo: Jonathan Hession, USA Network)\n\nBourne world forecast: Permanent gray\n\nEspionage and skullduggery, with brainwashed assassins in the middle, create the murkiest of moral environments in the \"Bourne\" films, in which Jason kills coldly but later feels guilt. There's a similar vibe in \"Treadstone,\" in which the operatives, including Patrick Fugit's conflicted math teacher Stephen Haynes, are programmed to kill.\n\n\"We don't really have good guys or bad guys. People do bad things, but according to them, their actions are completely justified,\" Smith says. \"But we also play out the consequences of a lot of these decisions.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/16/how-bourne-identity-compares-to-new-tv-spinoff-treadstone/3927613002/", "description": "\"Treadstone,\" USA Network's 10-episode action-thriller, explores the secret CIA assassin program that produced the iconic (and absent) Jason Bourne.", "authors": ["Bill Keveney", "Published P.M.
