It was exactly what a proper centre-forward should be doing.\n\n(Image: Offside via Getty Images)\n\n\"I saw him play against West Ham and Newcastle recently and there was a complete lack of movement in his game.\n\n\"But on Sunday he was full of running and energy, giving Liverpool's back four problems all match.\"\n\nRashford ended a barren run of just one goal from open play in his previous 22 appearances for club and country when he scored the first in England's 6-0 drubbing of Bulgaria last week.\n\nHis strike appeared to give him renewed confidence in front of goal, and he'll now be boosted by the return of Anthony Martial to the United first-team fold.\n\n(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)\n\nShearer added: \"Rashford is playing in a very average team right now where he has to feed off scraps, so he deserved his standing ovation at the end when he was replaced by Anthony Martial.\n\n\"It\u2019s unfair to have all that pressure on Rashford, but Martial\u2019s return from injury could now ease the burden on him for goals.\"\n\nUnited boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also hailed Rashford's 'fantastic movement' for his goal, and was full of praise for his performance.\n\nSolskjaer said: \"He has had a few games with his back to goal where we haven't given him the ball and I think that was his best game for me.\"", "description": "The Man Utd striker was on the scoresheet and provided tireless running for his team in the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Offside Via Getty Images", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661223.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
