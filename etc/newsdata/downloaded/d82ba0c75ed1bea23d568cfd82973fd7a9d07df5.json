HSBC agreed to pay $650,000 to settle the case, which also included allegations of reporting failures.\n\nThe CFTC adopted its risk-management rules in the wake of the financial crisis, alongside a host of other requirements for swaps dealers. Swaps are bets on the direction of interest rates, commodities and other assets.\n\nThe enforcement action shows the regulator underscoring the importance of postcrisis rules that otherwise haven\u2019t received much attention among the wave of changes adopted under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul, according to Aitan Goelman, a former enforcement director at the CFTC.\n\n\u201cThere is a concern that they become [viewed as] mere suggestions,\u201d said Mr. Goelman, who left the CFTC in 2017 and is now a partner in the white-collar-defense practice at Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. \u201cI think this is an illustration of the CFTC saying, \u2018No, guys. You really have to follow this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe CFTC described its settlement with HSBC as part of a continuing effort to ensure swaps dealers have strong internal controls in place.\n\n\u201cThe commission\u2019s swap-dealer risk management rules are designed to monitor and regulate systemic risk endemic to the swaps market,\u201d said James McDonald, director of the CFTC\u2019s enforcement division, in a press release announcing the case.\n\nAt issue in the HSBC case\u2014and other enforcement actions involving swaps reporting\u2014is the CFTC\u2019s ability to collect accurate data about a large financial market that was largely opaque before Dodd-Frank, attorneys said.\n\nAccording to the settlement, HSBC\u2019s U.S. division from January 2013 until November 2015 had no governing body in place to identify and manage swaps-related risks. Additionally, the bank approved risk-tolerance limits and policies for its swaps business as part of broader reviews across its business lines, rather than separately as a stand-alone unit, the agency said.\n\n\u201cWe have since improved all relevant systems and processes,\u201d HSBC spokesman Rob Sherman said in an email.\n\nThe bank didn\u2019t admit or deny the regulator\u2019s findings, according to the settlement.\n\nThe case sends a message to swaps dealers, several of which have been fined by the CFTC in recent years for faulty data reporting, said Michael Spafford, a partner in the investigations and white-collar-defense practice at Paul Hastings LLP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of having the systems in place,\u201d Mr. Spafford said. \u201cThey have to be supervised.\u201d\n\nWrite to Kristin Broughton at Kristin.Broughton@wsj.com", "description": "In a first, the swaps regulator charged a bank with violating risk-management regulations put in place after the financial crisis.", "authors": ["Kristin Broughton", "Kristin.Broughton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103935/social"}
