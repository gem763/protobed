They like to move the ball around, they are very good on transition, and George\u2019s work rate off the ball has been absolutely exceptional.\u201d\n\nFord has been in superb form this World Cup yet still found himself demoted to the bench against Australia, with Jones potentially concerned about destructive Wallabies center Semu Kerevi\u2019s ability to punch a hole through the flyhalf channel. Farrell is seen as a better defender than Ford.\n\nWith Farrell now back as inside center, Jones has reverted to the twin-playmaker option.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a different role this week to last week,\u201d Ford said, \u201cbut my job for the team doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nJonny May recovered from what England called a \u201ctwinge\u201d to his hamstring to take his place on the left wing.\n\nIn a change among the replacements, Mark Wilson came in for fellow flanker Lewis Ludlam.\n\nNo. 8 Billy Vunipola wins his 50th cap for England, the 2003 champion which is playing in the World Cup semifinals for the first time since 2007.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand is a great team - they have an impressive winning record since the last Rugby World Cup,\u201d Jones said, referring to the All Blacks\u2019 84% win ratio over the past four years. \u201cLike any good team, you have to take away time and space from them and you have to find areas you can pressure them. We believe we have identified a number of areas where we can do that.\u201d\n\nThirteen players in the England squad were part of the British and Irish Lions party that earned a 1-1 series draw against the All Blacks in 2017.\n\nEngland has only played once against New Zealand since the last World Cup, however, and the All Blacks won that match 16-15 at Twickenham last year after coming from 15-0 down.\n\n\u201cThe squad,\u201d Jones said, \u201chas approached the game well with real maturity. It has helped having players here who have been on the Lions tour and played against New Zealand. They have been involved in some of the biggest games in world rugby so this semifinal won\u2019t faze them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nEngland team: Elliot Daly, Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell (captain), Jonny May, George Ford, Ben Youngs; Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill, Tom Curry, Courtney Lawes, Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Jamie George, Mako Vunipola.
