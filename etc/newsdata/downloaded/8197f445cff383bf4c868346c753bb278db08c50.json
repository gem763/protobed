He also told his interviewer that he\u2019s not worried about a single thing connected to the Barr/Durham investigation.\n\nThe best part though is when he complains about transparency and things leaking out, considering this is the guy who gave FBI memos to his friend Daniel Richman to pass along to a New York Times reporter \u2026 so if anyone knows about leaks, it\u2019s Comey.\n\nCOMEY: \u201cI am not worried about a single thing in connection with any of the matters under investigation\u201d pic.twitter.com/LYeiFWA1ht \u2014 ALX \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\udf83 (@alx) October 26, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s interesting because a whole lot of people connected to him are starting to sound worried.\n\nShorter Comey: \u201cI\u2019m not worried because it was Obama that ordered Brennan to trick me, Clapper, McCabe, Page, Strzok et al. into using Hillary\u2019s Fusion GPS scam to hoodwink the FISA Court into allowing us to spy on the Trump campaign, dammit!\u201dhttps://t.co/yYZ4t2STPz \u2014 Adam Baldwin (@AdamBaldwin) October 26, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s not very bright. \u2014 Cory Bridgmon (@cbridgmon) October 26, 2019\n\nTranslation: \u201cI\u2019m terrified but I like to lie.\u201d \u2014 Daniel \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@bamabear82) October 26, 2019\n\nWhen you have to say you\u2019re not worried.. you\u2019re worried \u2014 Studsker (@suestud74) October 26, 2019\n\nLike every other narcissist that has ever existed. Of course no one knows what other sort of \"memos\" he wrote for himself about other senior gov't officials. \u2014 David Willis (@deadeyedave5157) October 26, 2019\n\nThis is incredible. From 0:34 to 0:46 pay attention to what he says. \u2014 R6Y1A4N (@SlimRyan45) October 26, 2019\n\nNot believing you Jimmy \u2014 Joe Arredondo (@JoeArredondo6) October 26, 2019\n\nSure, Jimmy. Let\u2019s see if that\u2019s true six months from now. \u2014 Jim (@Jimmy_da_chin) October 26, 2019\n\nBoy, the level of denial with this man is unreal. \u2014 Stan Staton (@stahawg) October 26, 2019\n\nBecause @Comey thinks he\u2019s untouchable.

Who gave the alphabet agencies that right? The American voters certainly didn\u2019t. This is everything that is wrong with the Swamp! \u2014 Samantha Em (@SamanthaEm10) October 26, 2019\n\nSomebody should tell him that his buddies Clapper and Brennan are pretty worried. \u2014 RobertHatton\ud83c\udfb8 (@TheRobertHatton) October 26, 2019\n\nPride goeth before the fall\n\nAnd a haughty spirit before ruin \u2014 ariel jones \ud83d\udd4a (@arieljones411) October 26, 2019\n\nRead his face.

It sucks but its true. \u2014 Doodles \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@DoodlesTrks) October 26, 2019\n\nIt's hard to even look at, or listen to, such a grotesque, self righteous, egotistical degenerate such as Comey. His hubris knows no bounds. This is a garbage human being. He's a tortured, depraved man. A soulless, wicked, self serving, repulsive clown. And that's me being nice. \u2014 The Forgotten (@melanie_ando) October 26, 2019\n\nMaybe he should be worried because it\u2019s fixing to get real. \u2014 Joyce B Henson \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JoyceBHenson2) October 26, 2019\n\nTranslation: he\u2019s very worried and it\u2019s all he thinks about, even in his sleep, which he gets very little of these days for obvious reasons. \u2014 Daisy \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@DaisyW3stov3r) October 26, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "James Comey says he's not worried at all about the Barr/Durham investigation.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/james-comey-testimony.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
