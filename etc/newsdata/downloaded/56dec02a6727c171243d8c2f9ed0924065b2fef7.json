USA TODAY\n\nTORONTO -- Zion Williamson\u2019s absence as the NBA season opens is a downer, no doubt about it.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans rookie forward will miss six-to-eight weeks after surgery Monday to address a torn right lateral meniscus in his knee.\n\nThe Pelicans will be cautious with Williamson and bring him back when he\u2019s 100% ready. There\u2019s no sense risking his health - or their future.\n\nOther teams have played it safe, too, with prized rookies such as Blake Griffin and Joel Embiid missing their rookie seasons to players such as Markelle Fultz, who missed 68 of 82 games his first season with a shoulder injury.\n\nLonnie Walker tore his meniscus in a preseason game a year ago and played in just 17 games for San Antonio, and Denver\u2019s Michael Porter Jr. missed his rookie season because of back issues.\n\nBottom line: it\u2019s not unusual for rookies to miss a portion \u2013 or even a significant portion \u2013 of the season.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports examines how some rookies have fared after facing a slow start because of injury:\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers star had two foot injuries that sidelined him not only for his rookie season but for his second season, too. He\u2019s turned into one of the best players in the NBA and averaged 27.5 points and 11.1 rebounds last season. He makes the Sixers a championship contender in the Eastern Conference.\n\nBlake Griffin\n\nGriffin broke his left kneecap in his final preseason game of what would have been his rookie season with the LA Clippers. He missed all of 2009-10 and returned the following season, averaging a double-double in points and rebounds (22.5/12.1). He was named Rookie of the Year. He is a six-time All-Star and five-time All-NBA performer.\n\nBen Simmons\n\nSimmons had surgery to repair a broken foot and didn\u2019t play in 2016-17. He came back the following season and won Rookie of the Year. Alongside Embiid, he\u2019s another key factor in Philadelphia\u2019s championship aspirations. He made his first All-Star Game last season.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers guard Ben Simmons (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLonnie Walker\n\nWalker, like Williamson, had a meniscus surgery and was out six-to-eight weeks to start his rookie season a year ago with the San Antonio Spurs. He spent time in the G-League and made his NBA debut on Jan. 3.\n\nGreg Oden\n\nOden is the poster child for players whose careers were derailed by injuries. He missed what would have been his rookie season with the Portland Trail Blazers after suffering a right knee injury. He played 61 games in 2008-09 before injuring his left knee. He played 21 games in 2009-10 before another injury to his left knee and then missed the next three seasons. In seven seasons, Oden played in just 105 games.\n\nJulius Randle\n\nRandle broke his leg 14 minutes into his NBA debut and missed the rest of the season. He has been reliable in the lineup since, playing in at least 73 games the next four seasons, including 82 in 2017-18. He averaged 21.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists for the New Orleans Pelicans last season and is now with the New York Knicks.\n\nBill Walton\n\nWalton had chronic foot injuries and played in 35 games his rookie season. He missed three full seasons because of foot injuries and played in 65 or more games just three times. However, Walton managed to play portions of 10 seasons, including 67 and 80 games late in his career with the Boston Celtics. He is in the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "Why playing it safe may be the best course of action for rookie forward Zion Williamson and the New Orleans Pelicans after his knee surgery.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published A.M.
