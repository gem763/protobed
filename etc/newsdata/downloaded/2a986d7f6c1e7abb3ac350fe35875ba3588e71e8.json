Instead, 5-Star struck a deal with the centre-left Democratic party (PD), shunting Salvini into opposition.\n\nHowever the initial indications from Umbria suggest the new 5-Star/PD alliance has failed its first electoral test.\n\nThe exit poll suggested Vincenzo Bianconi, leader of a civic alliance backed by 5-Star and the PD, would get 35.5% to 39.5%, while Claudio Ricci, a rightwing independent candidate, is seen at 1.5% to 4.5%.\n\nThe League chief had criss-crossed landlocked Umbria for weeks, promoting his national pledge to introduce a flat-tax rate many economists say Italy cannot afford, but which the League insists is needed to revive the sluggish economy.\n\nHis message found fertile ground in Umbria, where output slumped 15% in the decade after the 2007 financial crisis, compared with a 5% slide across Italy, according to Bank of Italy data.\n\nUmbria marks the eighth straight victory for the centre-right in regional ballots since the last national election, in March 2018.\n\nMore important tests lie ahead that could potentially undermine the new national government.\n\nIn December, the poor southern region of Calabria goes to the polls and it will be the turn on 26 January of Emilia Romagna, a northern region with more than four times the population of Umbria and which is the historic heartland of Italy\u2019s left.\n\nOpinion polls show the League, with its anti-migrant, anti-tax message, has shed little support since it lost power nationally and remains easily Italy\u2019s most popular party, with around 30% of the vote.", "description": "Donatella Tesei, backed by Matteo Salvini\u2019s League and Silvio Berlusconi, appears set to win in centre-left Italian stronghold", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fee70b54e34ff759af4913f4cac4dab07f39e437/147_0_4637_2783/master/4637.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48a51a2537d15f94a53a9e794f6692d1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
