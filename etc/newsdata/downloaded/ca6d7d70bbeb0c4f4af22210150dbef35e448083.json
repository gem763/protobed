The new developments pose a challenge for the department to chart a new way forward, he added.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Cape Town dams are 80.6% full, but the Karoo and southern Cape are still struggling to fill dams.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9197/baf6be807c814d828874683d572e67e0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-13"}
