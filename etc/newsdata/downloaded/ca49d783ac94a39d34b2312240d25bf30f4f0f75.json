(AP) - Daniel Jones and the New York Giants\u2018 run of success got a reality check from the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nAfter breathing life back into the Giants\u2018 season by engineering wins over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Washington Redskins, Jones and the Giants (2-3) took their lumps in a 28-10 loss to the Vikings on Sunday.\n\nJones was limited to 182 yards passing and threw an interception in his first loss since replacing Eli Manning as the starter three weeks ago. The offense that had averaged 28 points in the victories missed its chances. The offensive line allowed Jones to be sacked four times and hit eight other times.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the defense. A week after limiting Washington to 176 total yards, it gave up 490 yards to Minnesota.\n\nThe bottom line is the Giants didn\u2019t play well enough and they now head to New England for a game against the Super Bowl champion Patriots (5-0) on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cI think we played against four really good defenses prior to this, but I think each person that played today- number one, you can\u2019t get discouraged,\u201d coach Pat Shurmur said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for guys who get discouraged, those are the guys we\u2019re going to get out of here_the ones that get discouraged. You can\u2019t get discouraged. We didn\u2019t make enough plays. So, everybody goes back, and we\u2019ll do it quickly because we\u2019ve got a game on a short horizon here, and make our corrections and move on.\u201d\n\nThe Giants had their chances against the Vikings. Jones missed a wide-open Sterling Shepard on a deep route on the Giants\u2018 opening series, and he was too high on a third-quarter throw to Shepard in the back of the end zone with New York trailing 18-7. It settled for a field goal.\n\n\u201cThey are a good defense and they deserve credit,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLike I said, I think we created enough opportunities for ourselves to win. Maybe there wasn\u2019t as much space at times, but I think that\u2019s going to happen any game, and as long as you are creating opportunities, you need to be able to convert those. We didn\u2019t do that, I didn\u2019t do that, that\u2019s why we lost.\u201d\n\nShepard said everyone on the offense needed to step up.\n\n\u201cI mean, that was a great defense that we just faced,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we look at ourselves as a great offense. Like I said, it\u2019s a game of inches. You have to be sound in everything that you do. We have to get in the film room and figure out what we need to correct before this quick turnaround.\u201d\n\nVikings defensive end Everson Griffen was impressed with Jones (31 of 38) and his courage under pressure.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good player, so I see good things happening for him in the future,\u201d said Griffen, who had a sack and a hurry.\n\nThe Giants\u2018 211 yards made for their lowest total since gaining 170 yards in a 20-10 loss at Washington on Nov. 23, 2017. Their 64 yards rushing were their fewest since they ran for 47 in the loss to the Titans last season. The Giants finished with 147 net passing yards, their lowest total since they threw for 121 yards in a victory against Washington on Dec. 31, 2017.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Daniel Jones and the New York Giants' run of success got a reality check from the Minnesota Vikings.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Canavan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/vikings_giants_football_70547_c0-163-3881-2425_s1770x1032.jpg?452d26e519962b58944bd22cf165350d8c173266", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
