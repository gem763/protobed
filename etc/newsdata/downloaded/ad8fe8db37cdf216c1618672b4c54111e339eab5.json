REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\nEuropean stocks were on track to open lower after big gains the previous day, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures STXEc1 down 0.19%, German DAX futures FDXc1 shedding 0.25% and FTSE futures FFIc1 losing 0.39%.\n\nU.S. S&P500 futures fell 0.3% also on rising caution over U.S-China trade deal after China lambasted new legislation taking a hard line on China.\n\nU.S. and European shares had jumped on Tuesday as officials and diplomats involved in Britain\u2019s negotiations with the EU said differences between the two sides had been narrowed significantly.\n\nAs last-ditch talks continued well beyond midnight, caution set in among investors, and the British pound GBP=D3 slipped back to $1.2752, dropping 0.3%, having shot up to $1.28 on Tuesday, a level unseen since May 21.\n\nThe pound had strengthened nearly 5% over the past week as investors rushed to reprice the prospect of a last-minute Brexit deal before the end-October deadline.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier had been demanding a legal text of any agreement by midnight U.K. time. However, the talks between Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiator David Frost and the EU\u2019s executive European Commission went well past midnight in Brussels, and were set to resume on Wednesday.\n\nThe EU will determine whether a deal is fit to be put to Thursday\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit for consideration, but even then there is a question whether Britain\u2019s minority government could win approval for any deal from the country\u2019s divided parliament.\n\n\u201cWatching the UK news channels last night, the arithmetic for achieving said approval is challenging to say the least,\u201d analysts at National Australia Bank wrote in a note.\n\nMany Asian share markets still held some gains in the wake of Tuesday gains by U.S. and European equities.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4% while Japan's Nikkei .N225 jumped 1.5%, hitting 10-month highs.\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI index .KS11 climbed 0.6%, encouraged by South Korea's central bank cutting its policy interest rate for the second time in three months.\n\nStronger-than-expected earnings from major U.S. banks JPMorgan (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) also boosted equities even as the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 global growth forecast for a fifth time.\n\nIndeed, news on the U.S.-China trade front has been less encouraging.\n\nBloomberg reported, citing sources, that China will struggle to buy $50 billion of U.S. farm goods annually unless it removes retaliatory tariffs on American products, which would require reciprocal action by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nChina also said Beijing resolutely opposed new measures passed by the U.S. House of Representatives related to the Hong Kong protests and urged lawmakers to stop interfering.\n\nThe news helped to lift the safe-haven Japanese yen JPY= from a 2-1/2 month low hit on Tuesday against the dollar.\n\nThe yen stood at 108.68 per dollar, compared to Tuesday\u2019s low of 108.90.\n\nThe dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies hovered near three-week lows at 98.316. The euro EUR= was little changed at $1.1032.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude added 10 cents to $58.84 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 7 cents to $52.88 after falling the previous session over fears the unrelenting U.S.-China trade war would keep squeezing the global economy.\n\nSpot gold firmed slightly to $1,483.86 an ounce.", "description": "Shares markets lost some steam in Asian trading on Wednesday while sterling came off five-month highs as investors remained uncertain whether crunch talks in Brussels would lead to a deal to avoid a disorderly British exit from the European Union.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441327425&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F05E", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
