It\u2019s the organizations first update in five years and it asks more questions than it answers.\n\nIn short, the IRS has firmed its stance that cryptocurrency should be taxed under the same rules as any other property or capital gains. There\u2019s nothing new here in that respect.\n\nAs cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center states, there are some good things to come of this update, but there are some bad, too. It also raises some questions, which suggests the IRS still doesn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with the new guidance?\n\nThe values that taxes should be paid on have been clarified. The amount of tax to be paid on an asset is based on the amount spent to obtain it.\n\nThe main point of confusion appears to be tax obligations following hard forks and airdrops of new cryptocurrencies.\n\nRules around airdrops and hard forks\n\nAccording to the IRS, if you receive cryptocurrency through an airdrop or hard fork, whether you asked for it or not, you are obliged to pay tax on it.\n\nThe tax you owe is calculated based on the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the coin, regardless of whether it can be spent, exchanged, or transferred.\n\nWhat will likely be most annoying is that holders will be obligated to pay tax on an asset that they didn\u2019t necessarily ask for.\n\nIs the IRS is confused by airdrops?\n\nConsider when Bitcoin SV was created, some exchanges airdropped coins into user wallets as part of the transition to supporting the coin. All of a sudden, holders have to pay tax on it even though they\u2019ve done nothing to acquire the asset.\n\nAs self-proclaimed cypherpunk Jameson Lopp stated on Twitter, this doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nToday's IRS guidance is a hot mess.\n\n1. What if you have keys but no software from which to spend the asset?\n\n2. What if you never sell or transfer the asset and it drops 90% in value?\n\n3. What's the value if the asset isn't even trading at the time of fork?https://t.co/jJ5SdXU72i pic.twitter.com/SpTOIOKqg0 \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) October 9, 2019\n\nAs Coin Center points out, most of this chaos appears to result from the fact the IRS perceives a taxable event when a holder has control and \u201cdominion\u201d over a cryptocurrency, rather than when they exercise those rights.\n\nIndeed, the IRS clearly has yet more clarification to offer on these topics. I guess maybe we\u2019ll get it in another five years.\n\nBut, in the meantime, you can guarantee the IRS will go after anyone it suspects isn\u2019t paying sufficient tax. Earlier this year, it began sending letters to those it suspected of not declaring the correct amount of tax on their cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nYou can read the IRS\u2018 full guidance here.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
