The report found that only 1.8% of Europe\u2019s seas are covered by marine protected areas, with management plans. \u201cThis effectively makes them paper parks,\u201d WWF said in a statement on its report that assessed progress in the EU\u2019s 23 coastal states.\n\nThe requirement to create marine protected areas is part of the EU\u2019s efforts to meet international targets to ensure that 10% of the world\u2019s oceans are protected by 2020 \u2013 a goal campaigners believe is too weak to ensure thriving seas and oceans in the long-term.\n\nJanica Borg, lead author of the study, said it was impossible for Europe to meet the 2020 target. \u201cWithout urgent action to implement effective plans for nature conservation or restoration, with proper restrictions against extractive activities, nearly all EU MPAs will fail to support our ocean\u2019s resilience in the climate emergency\u201d she said.\n\nThe study found that 19 of 23 member states were falling behind on developing management plans while 11 had not announced any plan at all.\n\nThe patchy effort means that wildlife in the Baltic, North Sea and Mediterranean remains vulnerable to overfishing, bottom trawling, drilling for oil or gas, or noise coming from wind turbines being hammered into the seabed. Scientists revealed last year that destructive fishing is worse in wildlife zones than outside them.\n\nThe authors highlighted the problems at Dogger Bank, the large sand bank in the North sea, described as a \u201ccross-border conservation failure\u201d by the UK, Germany and Denmark. Despite a decade of talks on conservation, bottom fishing continues to scar the seabed, while sharks and corals are swept up by industrial trawlers.\n\n\u201cThere is no one issue to be singled out,\u201d Borg said. \u201cWe have really good nature laws \u2026 the problem is implementation. Shortcuts are made, derogations are allowed from some of these laws and that means what was intended to be a good way to protect European nature is falling short.\u201d\n\nThe European commission, which is responsible for upholding EU law, has painted a rosier picture of progress towards the 2020 target, reporting that 10.8% of Europe\u2019s seas had been designated as a marine protected areas by the end of 2016. But the WWF report focuses on what is happening at sea, rather than goals.\n\nThe commission concedes, however, that most marine protected areas are too small, as more than half of the sites are less than 30km squared. It has urged member states to create larger reserves in deeper waters.\n\nMarine protected areas restrict economic activities, but also contain smaller marine reserves, where all fishing and energy extraction is banned.\n\nWWF argues that short-term economic interests have been prioritised for too long. \u201cTraditionally, marine protection has been seen as a sideline activity,\u201d Borg said. \u201cIt is easy at first to put your fisheries in place, to put your shipping in place and only then to start looking at the area we have for conserving nature. But that is actually the wrong way round. Marine protection isn\u2019t a hobby \u2026 It is something we do because it is absolutely imperative for having any kind of sustainable economy in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "WWF conservationists say marine wildlife sanctuaries are failing to protect the seas", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6933b5ed0f691dcec530e2af1e9cbe335acd68/0_167_5051_3030/master/5051.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56d926d42c0d937d3cef3f184cfde5f2", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
