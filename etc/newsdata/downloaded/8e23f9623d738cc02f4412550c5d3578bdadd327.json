The resolution passed 236 to 174 \u2014 short of the two-thirds support needed for a veto-proof majority. The Senate also did not reach that threshold when it passed the measure on Wednesday.\n\nIt was the second time that Congress has tried to block the emergency funding. But since that vote in March, the Pentagon has released a list of $3.6 billion in military construction projects that were being canceled to pay for Trump\u2019s wall.\n\nThose opposed to the wall thought the new data might spur more Republicans to break with Trump to protect projects in their states, particularly those incumbents facing tough reelections. But only 11 Senate Republicans and 11 House Republicans voted to overturn the national emergency.\n\n\u201cThe taxpayers of the United States will pay for his stupid, useless wall, cutting essential things from the Coast Guard . . . cutting funds from the military who need these facilities for their troops and troop morale and for the safety and security of our troops, all for a stupid wall,\u201d Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) said on the House floor.\n\nTrump issued the emergency declaration after a standoff with Congress over wall funding resulted in a 35-day partial government shutdown. Congress can vote to overturn the declaration through a disapproval resolution, but that still requires the president\u2019s signature.\n\nRepublicans who spoke on the floor accused the Democrats of \u201cpolitical theater\u201d and advocating for open borders.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with really legislating,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).\n\n\u201cWe now want to open the borders up and have this country become what was previously a nation of laws become overrun and say that laws are no longer sanctified in this country,\u201d said Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) \u201cWe have a president who\u2019s bold, who\u2019s recognized what\u2019s not been recognized by previous presidents, that we do have an emergency.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats pushed back against the GOP contention that there is an emergency at the border. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) said, \u201cThe president is raiding actual national security priorities to build his wall.\u201d", "description": "President Trump is certain to veto the resolution, which also passed the Senate.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "Erica Werner", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On Economic Policy", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jjyRqcBZYFqplNWw5a3tuOtplyM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EDOTZIXBHUI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
