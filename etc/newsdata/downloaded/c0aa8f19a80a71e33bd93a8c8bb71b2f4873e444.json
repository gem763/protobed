Scott Mahaskey/Politico 2020 Elections Bennet: President and VP's families should not have foreign business dealings\n\nSen. Michael Bennet said Thursday he wouldn\u2019t allow his own vice president\u2019s children to make foreign business dealings like those made by Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, as he laid down a warning for Democrats seeking to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be better not to have that kind of an arrangement, and it\u2019d be better not to give speeches to Goldman Sachs,\" Bennet said in an hourlong interview in POLITICO's newsroom. \"It\u2019d be better for people just to be public servants.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Colorado Democrat, who is seeking his party's presidential nomination, also suggested that Biden will need to show that the Ukraine flap will not be a political weakness against Trump in 2020. Trump has made unsubstantiated charges that Biden interfered in a Ukrainian investigation into a company that had his son on its board of directors. Trump asked Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens in a phone call earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThis is all going to come up in the context of the underlying question, which is, who can beat Donald Trump?\u201d Bennet said. \u201cThis will all get litigated. I\u2019m confident that when it has the scrutiny it will have, the vice president will make his case.\u201d\n\nOn the allegations against Hunter Biden, Bennet said there is no merit to them \u201cbased on what I know,\u201d calling Trump's focus on it a distraction.\n\n\u201cToday, what I think it is is distracting us from where we should be focused, which is on Donald Trump calling up a foreign leader and telling him to investigate one of his political opponents,\" Bennet said. \"No matter what Hunter Biden did, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine that it\u2019s not 1 million times more benign than that.\"\n\nBut Bennet criticized Democrats who \u201con the day the complaint is being released\u201d are already concluding that the president should be impeached over his actions on Ukraine. Bennet warned that Democrats\u2019 impeachment proceedings against Trump may backfire on the party if it \u201cdoesn\u2019t reflect a commitment to due process.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

This week, the White House released a memo describing the conversation between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president in which Trump asked for an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday afternoon that the House would begin impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\nIf impeachment proceedings feels like \u201ca thoughtful process and the American people are brought along with it, as they were with the Watergate process, then I think we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be cavalier about it.\u201d\n\nBennet, who\u2019s running as a moderate alternative to more left-leaning candidates in the Democratic primary, defined what he saw as a key difference between himself and Biden\u2019s candidacy: \u201cHis view of the world is that if we just get rid of Donald Trump, we\u2019re all going to go back to normal and I just completely disagree with that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTrump, in my view, is a symptom of a lot of problems,\u201d he said.", "description": "\u201cI think it\u2019d be better not to have that kind of an arrangement, and it\u2019d be better not to give speeches to Goldman Sachs,\" Bennet said.", "authors": ["Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a1/54/5cfecedf43938e25414576b119bd/20190926msmbennet-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
