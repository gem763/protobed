It\u2019s a long way, but he\u2019s in the best position.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the current count: Federer 20, Nadal 19, Djokovic 16.\n\nIn 2019, Djokovic and Nadal won two majors apiece, drawing closer to Federer, whose most recent Slam trophy came at the 2018 Australian Open.\n\nEach has a career Grand Slam, too.\n\nFederer\u2019s tally: eight from Wimbledon, six from the Australian Open, five from the U.S. Open, one from the French Open.\n\nNadal\u2019s tally: 12 from the French Open, four from the U.S. Open, two from Wimbledon, one from the Australian Open.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s tally: seven from the Australian Open, five from Wimbledon, three from the U.S. Open, one from the French Open.\n\nThe other relevant numbers are their ages: Federer 38, Nadal 33, Djokovic 32.\n\nNadal hasn\u2019t been this close in the \u201cstandings\u201d since the \u201cscore\u201d was Federer 1, Nadal 0, after Wimbledon in 2003. By the time Nadal picked up his first major, at the 2005 French Open, he trailed 4-0.\n\nFor so many years, so many folks were prepared to proclaim Federer the \u201cGOAT\u201d - Greatest Of All-Time - based largely on his accumulation of majors and a subjective assessment of supposed aesthetics. Others would point out that Nadal\u2019s edge in their head-to-head series, which currently stands at 24-16, should give him the nod. Djokovic, meanwhile, elbowed his way into the \u201cbest ever\u201d discussion, too, because he\u2019s the only one to have won four majors in a row, leads both of the others head to head (26-22 over Federer, 28-26 over Nadal) and broke up their hold on the No. 1 ranking.\n\nWhat\u2019s most impressive, really, is how this trio has ruled the sport for about 15 years.\n\n\u201cThe three of us are doing things that never were done in the history of tennis,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cI take pride in being part of this fight.\u201d\n\nThey have won 51 of the last 59 Grand Slam titles, including the past 12, and there hasn\u2019t been a first-time male champ at a major since 2014.\n\nHere\u2019s how different things are in the women\u2019s game: Bianca Andreescu\u2019s 6-3, 7-5 win against Serena Williams on Saturday made the 19-year-old Canadian the seventh first-time major champion in the past 11 events.\n\nOr put another way: Andreescu gave the women a Grand Slam champion born in the 2000s before the men have had one who was born in the 1990s.\n\nSome took it as a sign that change was afoot when Nadal was the only member of the Big Three to get to the semifinals at the U.S. Open. Djokovic, the defending champion and No. 1 seed, stopped while way behind in his fourth-round match, citing pain in his left shoulder. Federer, dealing with a bad back, bowed out in five sets in the quarterfinals.\n\nToo old for this?\n\nTwo 23-year-olds reached the semifinals, Medvedev and Matteo Berrettini, so maybe this was the time for a younger man to hold a trophy?\n\nNo. Instead, Nadal became the first man in the professional era to win five majors after turning 30.\n\n\u201cI can say that I\u2019m sure all of us, we\u2019re fighting our best to try to make this transition. It\u2019s really tough, because these guys, they are playing good tennis. I don\u2019t know what else to say. They are just playing amazing tennis,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to beat them, even to get a set from them. Even every game, to win, is tough. We\u2019re just doing our best job to try to make it happen sometimes.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Federer vs. Nadal vs. Djokovic provides plenty to talk about.\n\nAP Sports Writer Dan Gelston contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At some point, of course, Rafael Nadal and the rest of the Big Three will stop winning Grand Slam titles, someone younger will emerge and a shift at the top of tennis will happen.
