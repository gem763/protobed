When one ticket was found, the others would be destroyed. That, and it would require some detective work to locate their whereabouts.\n\nThe first clue was four Radio 1 presenters had gone hiding across the UK. Huw Stephens was in Wales, Mollie King in England, Arielle Free in Scotland and Phil Taggart in Northern Ireland.\n\nEach was within coughing distance of a Golden Ticket, and they were all hiding in a \u201cpark or green space.\u201d\n\nThat narrowed it down, right? A quick Google suggests there\u2019s around 27,000 parks in the UK.\n\nA clue on Greg James' podcast also suggested each ticket was \"on a seat\".\n\nJoggers ran past a ticket, cars whizzed by, but by 9am, nobody was any closer to stumbling upon the ultimate festival pass.", "description": "Greg James had the country searching for a Golden Ticket, and here's what happened", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07rx1wj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
