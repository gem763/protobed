REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nMugabe, one of the last \u201cBig Men\u201d of African politics who ruled the southern African nation for 37 years until he was ousted by his own army in November 2017, died in a Singapore hospital five days ago.\n\nHe is proving as polarising in death as he was in life, as the fight over where he will be buried threatens to embarrass his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and deepen divisions in the ruling ZANU-PF party.\n\nThe former president\u2019s body arrived at Harare\u2019s Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport shortly after 1330 GMT. A military guard of honour stood at attention as the casket was removed from the aircraft, draped in the national flag and accompanied by security chiefs.\n\n\u201cThe entire nation of Zimbabwe, our people, across the board are grieved and are in mourning because the light which led us to independence is no more, but his works, his ideology will continue to guide this nation,\u201d Mnangagwa said.\n\n\u201cOn the day we shall lay him to rest, on Sunday, I appeal to you in your hundreds, in your thousands, in your millions to show your love of our great leader who has left us,\u201d he added.\n\nMugabe\u2019s wife Grace, dressed in black with a black veil, was next to Mnangagwa at the airport. Also present were Mugabe\u2019s daughter Bona and Savior Kasukuwere, a former Mugabe cabinet minister and staunch ally who has been living in self-imposed exile in South Africa since early this year.\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga, the former general who led the coup that overthrew Mugabe, was conspicuous by his absence at the airport. He has been receiving treatment in China since July for an unknown illness\n\nCrowds had gathered at the airport well before the scheduled arrival time, with some wearing T-shirts bearing Mugabe\u2019s face and others with Mnangagwa\u2019s image, while music blared from loudspeakers.\n\nA convoy of 4x4 vehicles with number plates bearing the letters \u201cRG Mugabe\u201d and the former leader\u2019s signature were also on the runway.\n\nBLUE ROOF\n\nLeo Mugabe, a nephew and family spokesman, declined to say where Mugabe would be buried.\n\nMnangagwa said the body would be taken to Mugabe\u2019s palatial home in the capital, known as Blue Roof, after a detour to a military barracks for prayers.\n\nOn Thursday, ordinary Zimbabweans and supporters are expected to pay their last respects to Mugabe at a Harare soccer stadium, where the body will lie in state before being taken to his rural home in Kutama, 85 km (50 miles) from the capital, he added.\n\nMnangagwa and his party want Mugabe buried at a national monument to heroes of the liberation war against the white minority Rhodesian regime.\n\nBut some of Mugabe\u2019s relatives have pushed back against that plan. They share Mugabe\u2019s bitterness at the way former allies including Mnangagwa conspired to topple him and want him buried in his home village.\n\nSunday\u2019s burial will take place a day after a state funeral, but officials said the burial site would only be known after consultations with the family.\n\nMugabe left behind an economy wrecked by hyperinflation and deeply entrenched corruption, and a raging political rivalry between ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC.\n\nThe MDC said in a statement on Wednesday that it had postponed its 20th anniversary rally because of Mugabe\u2019s funeral. It said: \u201cNotwithstanding our legendary differences with Mr. Mugabe, we have no reason to exhibit barbarity by hosting a national festivity during his funeral.\u201d", "description": "The body of Zimbabwe's founder Robert Mugabe arrived at the country's main airport on Wednesday, but his final resting place remained a source of mystery amid a dispute between some family members and the government.", "authors": ["Macdonald Dzirutwe", "Alexander Winning", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428722563&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1AR-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
