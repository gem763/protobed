The highway in both directions was closed for hours.\n\nA fuel tanker caught fire on I-49 in Kansas City, Missouri. Amateur video was loaded to the internet on Friday\n\nThe fire initially was small, but the danger of a larger blaze was apparent to witnesses nearby\n\nGradually, the fire began to grow as it ate through the fuel tanker\n\nFirefighters who were called to the scene tried to douse the flames, but were unsuccessful\n\nSeveral lanes of the intersection were badly damaged as a result of the fire, according to police.\n\n\u2018This might be a problem,\u2019 says the motorist as he captures the scene on amateur cell phone video.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t believe the highway hasn\u2019t shut down yet. Holy crap.\u2019\n\nThe motorist was right, as the fire kept growing bigger and more menacing.\n\n\u2018If this thing blows, I\u2019m gonna feel the heat back here for sure,\u2019 the eyewitness, who is standing a few hundred feet away, says.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re all trying to watch it, but that trigger might explode and I might be too close.\u2019\n\nMoments later, firefighters arrive on the scene and try to douse the flames, but to no avail.\n\n\u2018Water\u2019s not gonna do it,\u2019 the narrating witness says.\n\nAs time went on, the fire began to grow significantly, generating smoke that could be visible for miles\n\nWitnesses who stood a few hundred feet from the blaze said they could feel the intensity of the heat\n\nAs the fire kept growing, one eyewitness wondered: \u2018I don\u2019t know what is inside there and why it\u2019s not blowing up.\u2019\n\nWhat was once a small-scale fire started ballooning to an ever-growing ball of flames that are often seen in Hollywood action movies.\n\n\u2018Oh, dude!\u2019 the witness yells. \u2018It\u2019s hot from where I\u2019m at!\u2019\n\nAs the fire grows even larger, the witness yells: \u2018Oh my god! Ho-ly crap!\u2019\n\nAnother witness nearby asks: \u2018Why don\u2019t they put it out?\u2019\n\nThe narrator replies: \u2018I don\u2019t know. [The fire is] too hot, too fast.\u2019\n\nHe then says: \u2018Yeah, this thing is no joke!\u2019\n\nAs the fire kept growing, the eyewitness wondered: \u2018I don\u2019t know what is inside there and why it\u2019s not blowing up.\u2019\n\nMoments later, however, he would be proven correct.\n\nEventually, the fire grew to mammoth proportions, prompting fire officials to evacuate witnesses nearby\n\n\u2018I can feel it from here! I can feel the heat big time from here!\u2019 an eyewitness says\n\nIt took emergency crews an hour to get the fire under control. A massive fireball is seen above\n\nAuthorities said that the fire was caused by a driver in a Ford Focus who struck the back of the fuel tanker\n\n\u2018This is way more intense than I thought!\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Oh my god, I can feel it from here. It\u2019s burning me from here!\n\n\u2018I can feel it from here! I can feel the heat big time from here!\u2019\n\nAt this point, as the fire grows catastrophically large, emergency personnel on site tell the eyewitnesses on the side of the road to move away.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re telling us to clear out,\u2019 he says.\n\nThe eyewitness says that his car is in danger of being engulfed by the flames, though the exact location of the vehicle is unclear from watching the video.\n\n\u2018My car is right there! I can\u2019t get close to it! Holy crap!\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I might lose my car.\u2019\n\nWith the fire growing ever more dangerous, a firefighter approaches the witnesses and orders them to move away.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s my car right there. What am I doing?\u2019 the eyewitness said.\n\n\u2018Get out of here! That\u2019s what\u2019s your doing!\u2019 the firefighter tells him.", "description": "Video shows a fuel tanker engulfed by flames on I-49 in Kansas City, Missouri.
