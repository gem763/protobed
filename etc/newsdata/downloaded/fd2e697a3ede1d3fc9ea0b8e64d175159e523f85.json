MLR (Major League Rugby) is going well. There are players going oversees. I think we've got some really exciting opportunities.\"\n\nMeanwhile Namibia coach Phil Davies, who would have been up against a fellow former Wales international in Canada boss Kingsley Jones if the game had gone ahead, backed the \"logical\" cancellation given \"safety is paramount\".\n\n\"I've never seen so much rain and being from Wales we see a lot of rain, but it's been phenomenal and it was the right decision.\"\n\nReflecting on Namibia's form at the World Cup, Davies highlighted their performance against New Zealand.\n\n\"Although the scoreboard was unkind in the end (the All Blacks won 71-9), to be 10-9 with the world champions after 35 minutes was a testament to how far the players have come over the past four years.\"\n\nHe added the biggest challenge now facing Namibia was to \"grow the game\".\n\n\"There are some tremendous clubs in Namibia but to go from seven to 10 clubs in the next four-year cycle, to go from 900 players to 4,000 playing the game and also establish a quality sevens programme would be amazing.\"\n\nAlthough this game has been cancelled, Sunday's crunch match between hosts Japan and Scotland is going ahead, as are the Wales-Uruguay and Tonga-USA fixtures.", "description": "Canada captain Tyler Ardron said he was left with a \"pretty disappointing\" feeling after Typhoon Hagibis forced the cancellation of his side's final Rugby World Cup match.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7887/886ab10dec4b44a5b781074cc4c3da62.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
