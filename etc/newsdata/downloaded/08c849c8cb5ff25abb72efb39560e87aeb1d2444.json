But then the home runs stopped making sense.\n\nA long drive by Yankees slugger Aaron Judge? The Houston Astros ace can live with that. This season, though, was full of surprises. Like when spindly utility man Ehire Adrianza drove a fastball into the right field party deck in Minnesota. Or the time light-hitting Angels infielder David Fletcher nearly put one into a parking lot beyond left field during a series in Monterrey, Mexico. Routine fly balls had become wall-scraping homers, and every hitter was suddenly strong enough to reach the second deck.\n\n\u201cThe game has changed completely,\u201d Verlander said.\n\nExpect more of the same this October.\n\nHitters smashed a record 6,776 home runs in 2019, soaring past the previous high of 6,105 from two years earlier. It\u2019s a rise of over 60% from 2014, a year before a seismic home run spike attributed to tweaks in the baseballs. Major League Baseball commissioned a study in 2018 that concluded there was less drag on the ball causing all those extra homers, but Commissioner Rob Manfred has insisted MLB doesn\u2019t know why. He has also denied accusations from Verlander and other pitchers that the balls have been deliberately altered.\n\nManfred told Forbes last week he has reconvened the scientists from the 2018 study and expects to issue another report after the World Series. His goal: \u201cpredictable, consistent performance from the baseball.\u201d\n\nFirst, though, may come the juiciest postseason yet.\n\nAcross the 10 playoff rosters, only three qualified hitters connected for fewer than 15 home runs this season - St. Louis\u2019 Kolten Wong (11), Milwaukee\u2019s Lorenzo Cain (11) and Houston\u2019s Josh Reddick (14). There were 21 such hitters on postseason teams in 2014.\n\nVerlander has been critical of structural changes to the baseball since 2017, when pitchers and coaches from the Astros and Dodgers complained that World Series balls were slicker than ones used in the regular season. They moaned and groaned while the clubs combined for a Series-record 25 homers, but fans largely oohed and awed - especially during Game 5, a topsy-turvy classic featuring seven home runs.\n\nVerlander has called this year\u2019s balls a \u201cjoke.\u201d He\u2019s given up a career-most 36 homers, yet he\u2019s neck-and-neck with teammate Gerrit Cole for the AL Cy Young Award. How\u2019d he do that?\n\n\u201cI used to pitch to weak contact,\u201d he said. \u201cI no longer try to miss barrels. I try to miss bats.\u201d\n\nAfter years of seeking quick outs to keep his pitch count low, Verlander has gone whole hog on punchouts. The 36-year-old totaled 300 of them in a season for the first time and surpassed 3,000 for his career in his final start. He avoided the middle of the plate at all costs, especially with runners on base - 28 of his homers were solo shots.\n\nOf course, strikeouts have surged everywhere - the majors set a record for the 12th consecutive season with 42,823 of them in 2019. There are varied reasons for that, including stronger arms and aggressive bullpen management, but pitchers say distrust in the baseball is a factor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an adaptation in the way I pitch that correlates with the ball, I just didn\u2019t necessarily realize I was doing it because of the ball,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cYou can no longer give in to a fastball away because 99% of players in Major League Baseball now can take an away fastball and hit a homer opposite field.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s my defense to that? My defense is I have to have you swing and miss.\u201d\n\nIn the clubhouse of the NL East-champion Braves, every pitcher seems to remember at least one home run this year that looked like a pop fly off the bat.\n\n\u201c(Christian) Yelich, he went straight-center off me,\u201d starter Mike Foltynewicz said.\n\n\u201c(Pete) Alonso, on a changeup,\u201d added rotation-mate Mike Soroka.\n\n\u201cYou just know sometimes you might make your pitch and it\u2019s not going to matter,\u201d All-Star reliever Shane Greene said.\n\nThose pitchers aren\u2019t as concerned about strategizing around the homers as they are with steeling themselves against the frustration of it all. Soroka had the lowest home run rate of any qualified NL starter, and he credits that to an effective sinker and a willingness to be \u201cstubborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way guys are hitting them out now, every time the ball goes in the air you think it has a chance,\u201d Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \u201cThey experience all that on a daily basis over the course of the season. The ones that are successful are the ones who can handle that adversity.\u201d\n\nThe postseason is a different game though, and not just because of the extra scrutiny and pressure. There are 26 hitters on postseason rosters who hit at least 30 home runs this season - not including Yelich, the Brewers\u2019 NL MVP contender who will miss the postseason with a broken kneecap. Four teams bypassed the previous season record for homers, with the Twins (307) and Yankees (306) becoming the first clubs to reach 300.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certain ballparks and certain times that you have to be patient,\u201d Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cBecause you know there are going to be a few more runs scored and balls are going to leave the ballpark.\u201d\n\nStressful stuff for pitchers and managers, no doubt, but if the 2017 World Series is an indication, it could be wild fun for fans, too. This year\u2019s postseason participants combined to win 73 times in the regular season when trailing after seven innings. When no lead is safe, no game can be boring, right?\n\nMaybe. Some are concerned that this year\u2019s big fly bonanza might have been too much even for the thrill-seekers in the seats.\n\n\u201cBefore, it was like the big wreck at a NASCAR race,\u201d Greene said. \u201cYou might see one, and everybody showed up to see that one homer. Now, you\u2019re going to see six.\u201d\n\nManagers have learned to live with all that carnage. Snitker maintained the baseball won\u2019t affect his decision-making, a sentiment echoed by Astros manager AJ Hinch. Yankees skipper Aaron Boone isn\u2019t sure what to anticipate, except he\u2019s pretty sure hitters will keep finding ways to connect.\n\n\u201cThe team that ends up winning the World Series,\u201d Boone said, \u201cwill do a good job of holding offenses down and will probably hit a lot of balls in the seats when they have traffic to create some big innings off of elite pitchers.\n\n\u201cWhat it ends up looking like, I don\u2019t know how to predict that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP freelancer Chris Talbott contributed from Seattle.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Justin Verlander didn't intend to alter his pitching strategy, not after 14 seasons as a major league ace.
