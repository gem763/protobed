White House lawyers tried to hide the reconstructed call transcript \u2014 and had done so before.\n\nIn the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced \u2014 as is customary \u2014 by the White House Situation Room. This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\n\nThe whistle-blower writes that White House lawyers \u201cdirected\u201d White House officials to remove records of the July 25 call from the system where such documents are normally stored and place it instead in a system for storing highly classified information, like files related to covert actions, even though it did not meet the criteria, in order to limit the number of officials who could see it. A White House official told the whistle-blower that it was an \u201cabuse\u201d of that system to instead use it to hide politically sensitive information.\n\nAnd in an appendix to the complaint, the whistle-blower wrote that White House officials had said this was \u201cnot the first time\u201d that a presidential transcript had been treated in that way, \u201csolely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\u201d\n\nThe complaint does not name the White House lawyers. But they would certainly either work for or include the top attorney there \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s White House counsel, Pat Cippolone.\n\n3. The State Department saw Giuliani\u2019s rogue outreach to Ukraine for Trump as a threat to national security.\n\nStarting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kyiv and the President. These officials also told me: that State Department officials, including Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, had spoken with Mr. Giuliani in an attempt to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d to U.S. national security; ...\n\nThe whistle-blower recounts the struggles by the senior United States diplomats to deal with the confusion created by the president dispatching his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure Ukrainian officials to develop dirt against the Bidens, both in the run-up to the July 25 call and its aftermath. Multiple officials said that Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that any meeting or phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine\u2019s new president would depend on whether the latter was willing to \u201cplay ball\u201d on Mr. Giuliani\u2019s demands.\n\n4. Trump\u2019s push for investigations coincided with a \u201csudden change of policy with respect to U.S. assistance for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nI learned from U.S. officials that, on or around 14 May, the President instructed Vice President Pence to cancel his planned travel to Ukraine to attend President Zelenskyy \u2019 s inauguration on 20 May; Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the delegation instead. According to these officials, it was also \u201cmade clear\u201d to them that the President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenskyy \u201cchose to act\u201d in office.\n\nThis is one of two manifestations of pressure on Ukraine by the Trump administration in advance of the July 25 call. The whistle-blower cautioned that he or she did not know for certain whether this action was connected with the broader understanding that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Zelensky to \u201cplay ball\u201d on Mr. Giuliani\u2019s demands. The whistle-blower recounted the episode in a partly redacted appendix along with a discussion of Mr. Trump\u2019s blocking of the military aid package Congress appropriated to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression:\n\nOn 18 July, an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official informed Departments and Agencies that the President \u201cearlier that month\u201d had issued instructions to suspend all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. Neither OMB nor the NSC staff knew why this instruction had been issued. During interagency meetings on 23 July and 26 July, OMB officials again stated explicitly that the instruction to suspend this assistance had come directly from the President, but they still were unaware of a policy rationale. As of early August, I heard from U.S. officials that some Ukrainian officials were aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy, but I do not know how or when they learned of it.\n\nThe appearance that Mr. Trump was using foreign policy as leverage to pressure Ukraine into producing dirt on a political rival is at the heart of the calls to impeach him.", "description": "The whistle-blower\u2019s complaint and the inspector general\u2019s report have been released.
