Rather, most have payouts that are constant over time (commonly referred to as nominal)--even though nominal payouts can result in a significant decline in purchasing power for a retiree.\n\nThere are two primary ways to consider inflation risk when it comes to annuities: explicitly or implicitly.\n\nMore In Wealth Management The Tax Benefits of a Partial Roth Conversion\n\nWhy I Kicked My College Graduate Out of the House\n\nThe Problem With Bonds in a Retirement Portfolio\n\nGot a Raise? Here's How Much of It You Need to Save for Retirement\n\nWhen Income-Sharing Agreements Are--and Aren\u2019t--the Better Option for Student Loans\n\nExplicitly considering inflation means to have the payments tied directly to inflation. This how Social Security retirement benefits work today, where benefits are tied to the change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. An annuity that has payments directly linked to inflation ensures a retiree will always have some constant amount available to spend, in today\u2019s dollars, throughout retirement. Annuities linked to inflation are still relatively rare, though, with only about 0.2% of annuities quoted in 2018 including the option.\n\nAn annuity that implicitly considers inflation could have what is called a \u201cfixed\u201d COLA, where the benefit would increase by some fixed percentage each year. Two percent is the most common fixed COLA among annuities quoted today. For example, if the initial benefit payment was $1,000, a 2% fixed COLA would result in a payment of $1,020 in the second year, $1,040 in the third, $1,061 in the fourth, etc. Note the 2% increase compounds over time.\n\nFixed COLAs aren\u2019t directly tied to inflation, so it\u2019s possible the annuity benefits could differ (materially) from cumulative inflation in retirement. Only about 4% of annuities quoted in 2018 included any kind of fixed COLA.\n\nTaken together, less than 5% of immediate and deferred annuities quoted in 2018 included any type of cost of living adjustment. This is way too low. While it\u2019s definitely true that not everyone needs an annuity with a COLA, more retirees should at least be considering them during the purchase process.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t COLAs included in more annuity quotes? I think they key reason is the impact COLAs have on initial payout rates.\n\nI ran some annuity quotes on Aug. 27 for a 65-year-old female, and the initial payout rate (payout divided by premium) for a nominal immediate annuity was 28% higher than an immediate annuity that included a 2% COLA (with the highest payout rates of 6.03% and 4.70%, respectively) and 58% higher than an immediate annuity with benefits linked to inflation (payout rate = 3.82%).\n\nWhile the initial payout rate for annuities with COLA is clearly lower than the basic nominal annuity (with constant payments) that doesn\u2019t mean COLA is a bad deal for retirees. The true value will depend on things like life expectancy, realized inflation levels, risk tolerance, etc. The key is to understand the differences in the payouts and place that into the context of what the retiree is trying to accomplish.\n\nModeling and discussing the implications of inflation is a critical component of a financial plan, since inflation can have a material impact on a retiree\u2019s standard of living. For example, even a 2% inflation rate will reduce purchasing by 40% over a 25-year period. The fact that relatively few annuity quotes today provide any type of COLA is a point of concern. At a minimum, retirees need to understand the differences in payouts for different types of benefits for annuities to make the most effective decision.\n\nYou can email Mr. Blanchett at reports@wsj.com.\n\nRead the latest Wealth Management report.", "description": "An annuity with payments directly linked to inflation ensures a retiree will have some constant amount available to spend, in today\u2019s dollars, says WSJ Wealth Management Expert David Blanchett.", "authors": ["David Blanchett"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FA610_annuit_P_20190920123355.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
