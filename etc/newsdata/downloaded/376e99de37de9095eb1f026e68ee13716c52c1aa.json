And keep going. Just get up every day and keep going.\u201d\n\nWhen posed the same question, Chelsea Clinton appeared caught off guard by the unvarnished response from her mother, who was often criticized by pundits for a perceived lack of authenticity on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cOh, goodness, I think I'm so overwhelmed by my mother's answer that I'm a bit out of words,\u201d she said, before citing her own role as a mom to three children.\n\nHillary Clinton also told ABC that she had not been questioned in relation to the Trump administration\u2019s investigation into the email records of current and former State Department officials who sent messages to her private email address.\n\nThe Washington Post reported over the weekend that those correspondences have been retroactively classified and could violate security protocols.\n\n\u201cI think it's an unfortunate diversion,\u201d Hillary Clinton said of the probe. \u201cYou go and you talk to people who've been experienced diplomats for many years, and then you retroactively classify what they said 10 years ago? I think it's really a shame that they're doing that, and hopefully people will not be distracted.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/37/41/df59551a4984aff461e680ab5245/181002-hillary-clinton-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
