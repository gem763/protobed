No matter what kinds of specs, features, cameras, or design it might sport, the Huawei Mate 30 series of smartphones won't have the one crucial thing that makes an Android phone worthwhile outside of China: Android apps from the Google Play Store.\n\nAnd that's a shame, because the Mate 30 phones have all the makings of a great Android smartphone, including a beautiful design, multiple cameras, great specs, and great battery life.\n\nCheck out one of the leaked photos of the Mate 30 Pro:\n\nEvan Blass/Twitter\n\nThe Huawei Mate 30 phones will reportedly still run an open-source version of Android, according to Reuters, but not a version that gives access to the Google Play Store, where users can find and install all the apps they want.\n\nWithout access to Google's Play Store, those who buy a Mate 30 smartphone won't have access to the apps they're used to using.\n\nGmail? Nope.\n\nGoogle Maps? Gone.\n\nYouTube? Negative.\n\nFacebook? Messenger? Instagram and WhatsApp? Most likely not.\n\nSnapchat, Netflix, TikTok, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, and Amazon? Unlikely.\n\nHuawei fans in China are used to this. Android phones in China haven't had access to Google's Play Store for years and Chinese app developers have made their own hugely popular apps, like social media platform Weibo, ecommerce app TaoBao, and the \"Netflix of China,\" IQIYI.\n\nIt's unclear if Huawei's phones will still be sold outside of China, like in Europe, Canada, Australia, and anywhere else where Huawei has successfully sold its smartphones in the past. We'll have to wait until Thursday to find out. But it's truly unclear who outside of China would want a Huawei phone if it doesn't run the apps they want.", "description": "Unfortunately for Huawei fans outside of China, the Huawei Mate 30 smartphone won't be an appealing option thanks to the ongoing trade war.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7fe4442e22af2b563acc27-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
