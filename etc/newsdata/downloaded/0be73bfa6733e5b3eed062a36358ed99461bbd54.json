Commanders sent 42 officers in five trucks.\n\nIt wasn't enough. More than 30 suspected drug cartel gunmen were waiting for them Monday, some in vehicles that were apparently armored, prosecutors in Mexico's western state of Michoacan said.\n\nOfficials said the gunmen opened up on the police convoy with .50-caliber sniper rifles and AR-15 and AK-47 assault rifles at about 8:00 a.m. Recordings circulating on social media show police calling for backup.\n\nA soldier next a charred truck belonging to Michoacan state police, after it was burned during an attack in El Aguaje, Mexico, October 14, 2019.

There are wounded!\" one officer says amid cries from another officer who was hit and with sound of gunfire in the background, according to Mexico News Daily.\n\nThirteen officers were killed, some of their bodies still inside the patrol trucks when the vehicles were set afire. Nine other officers were wounded.\n\nThe attack \u2014 the worst on Mexican law enforcement in years \u2014 came in a state where violence blamed on drug gangs has jumped in recent months.\n\nAuthorities said the state police convoy was ambushed as it sought to enforce a judicial order at a home in El Aguaje, a town in the municipality of Aguililla, which is the reputed birthplace of Nemesio \"Mencho\" Oseguera, leader of the hyper-violent Jalisco New Generation cartel.\n\nA pedestrian walks past a charred truck belonging to Michoacan state police, after it was burned during an attack in El Aguaje, Mexico, October 14, 2019.

Silvano Aureoles said.\n\nImages published in Mexican media showed vehicles burning in the middle of a highway and messages apparently signed by Jalisco New Generation, one of Mexico's most powerful and rising cartels. Aureoles said their authenticity was under investigation.\n\nBanners signed by the group, also called CJNG, indicated that the attack was directed at supporters of rival gangs.\n\nThe cap of a Michoacan state police officer in the brush where charred police trucks stand on the roadside after their police officer occupants were attacked in El Aguaje, Mexico, October 14, 2019.

Two police trucks were towed away.\n\nStreets were nearly empty as people apparently decided to stay indoors after the violent events.\n\nAfter the attack, the area in western Mexico's so-called hot lands was reinforced by federal and state security forces, which set up checkpoints to hunt for the assailants.\n\nMichoacan, an important avocado-growing state, has recently has seen a spike in violence that has brought back memories of the bloodiest days of Mexico's war on drug cartels between 2006 and 2012.\n\nA charred truck belonging to Michoacan state police on the side of the road after it was burned during an attack, as state police drive past in El Aguaje, Mexico, October 14, 2019.

Later, an area roughly 45 miles north of Aguililla was the scene of fierce clashes between members of Jalisco New Generation and regional self-defense groups.\n\nIn 2013, civilian groups faced with what they said was state inaction armed themselves in Michoacan to fight the Knights Templar cartel, one of whose bases was Aguililla.\n\nThey said they took up arms to defend themselves from kidnappings, extortion and killings by cartels. But some of the self-defense or vigilante groups later became infiltrated by cartels and gangs.\n\nThe government of former President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto launched a process to disarm and legalize the vigilante groups and incorporate them into official security forces.\n\nAureoles, the governor, says the self-defense groups haven't returned and has criticized federal authorities for not attacking drug cartels in Michoacan with sufficient force and for negotiating with vigilante groups he refers to as criminals.\n\nA charred truck that belong to Michoacan state police on the roadside after it was burned during an attack in El Aguaje, Mexico, October 14, 2019.

It is home to the port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, a key entry point for precursor chemicals used to make synthetic drugs.\n\nMexico's current president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has argued the best way to fight organized crime is by eliminating corruption and attacking the root causes of poverty.\n\nHe has advocated a \"hugs not bullets\" approach in which security forces are less confrontational but also created a national militarized police force, the National Guard, and sent it to some of Mexico's most violent regions.\n\nNationwide, homicides are on pace to break the record set in 2018, according to government data through August, showing that such killings had risen 3.3% to more than 23,000.\n\n\"You can't fight fire with fire,\" Lopez Obrador said Monday, according to The New York Times. \"You can't fight violence with violence, you can't fight evil with evil \u2014 you have to fight evil by doing good.\"", "description": "The gunmen opened fire on the police convoy with .50-caliber sniper rifles and AR-15 and AK-47 assault rifles early on Monday morning.", "authors": ["Mark Stevenson", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5dace4af90935b2338cfb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
