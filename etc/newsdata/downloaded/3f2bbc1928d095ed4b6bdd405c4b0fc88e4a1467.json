He asked a judge to decide whether he should accede to House demands for his testimony or to assert \"immunity from congressional process\" as directed by Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit came as Democrats' impeachment inquiry continued at full speed with a rare Saturday session. Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe, took questions behind closed doors for more than eight hours about Trump's ouster of the ambassador of Ukraine in May and whether he had knowledge about efforts to persuade Ukraine to pursue politically motivated investigations.\n\nKupperman, who provided foreign policy advice to the president, was scheduled to testify in a similar session on Monday. In the lawsuit, Kupperman said he \"cannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches.\" Without the court's help, he said, he would have to make the decision himself \u2014 one that could \"inflict grave constitutional injury\" on either Congress or the presidency.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is rooted in a July 25 phone call Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During the call, Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to pursue investigations of Democratic political rival Joe Biden's family and Ukraine's role in the 2016 election that propelled Trump into the White House.\n\nAt the time of the call, Trump was withholding congressionally approved military aid for Ukraine. He has repeatedly said there was no quid pro quo for the Ukraine investigations he was seeking, though witness testimony has contradicted that claim.\n\nKupperman's filing says \"an erroneous judgment to abide by the President's assertion of testimonial immunity would unlawfully impede the House from carrying out one of its most important core Constitutional responsibilities\" \u2014 the power of impeachment \u2014 and subject Kupperman to \"potential criminal liability for contempt of Congress.\"\n\nOn the other hand, \"an erroneous judgment to appear and testify in obedience to the House Defendants' subpoena would unlawfully impair the President in the exercise of his core national security responsibilities ... by revealing confidential communications\" from advisers, according to the filing.\n\nHe has asked the court to expedite a decision, but unless the judge issues an opinion by Monday, Kupperman's testimony might not occur as scheduled.\n\nRejecting his arguments, the three chairmen of the House committees overseeing the inquiry told Kupperman's lawyers in a letter that the suit was without merit and appeared to be coordinated with the White House. They called the suit \"an obvious and desperate tactic by the President to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nThe chairmen also said Kupperman's defiance of the subpoena would constitute evidence in a contempt proceeding as well as additional evidence of Trump's obstruction of the inquiry. They said they planned to proceed with the Monday session as scheduled.\n\nThe lawsuit came as Democrats investigating the president won a victory in a separate case. A federal judge ordered the Justice Department on Friday to give the House secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and affirmed the legality of the Democrats impeachment inquiry. That decision could inform Kupperman's suit.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted that he's \"not concerned with the impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong.\"\n\nIn the House deposition, Reeker was expected to corroborate testimony from previous witnesses who have described the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine, according to a person familiar with Reeker's role in Ukraine policy. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss the testimony and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nLawmakers leaving the meeting with Reeker said he was backing up testimony from previous witnesses, most all of whom have detailed concerns with Trump's efforts to oust Ukrainian ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and said they were wary of Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer who was driving the push for the Ukrainian probes.", "description": "After getting a subpoena Friday, former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman quickly filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in Washington.
