Earlier this month an officer was stabbed in the neck.\n\nPolice have responded with increasing amounts of rubber bullets, tear gas and even live rounds in recent clashes.", "description": "A Hong Kong court has banned people from publishing a wide range of personal details about police officers and their families, including photos, in a bid to...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/02/wire-20204966-1572055088-26_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
