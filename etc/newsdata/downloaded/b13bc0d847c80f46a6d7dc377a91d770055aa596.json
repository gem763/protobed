Consuming both appeared to bring the biggest benefit, with the participants who had the highest yogurt and fiber consumption together showing a 33 percent reduced risk of lung cancer compared to the group who consumed no yogurt and the least amount of fiber, which the researchers said suggests a potential synergism between the two foods.\n\nThe findings also held true after taking into account all known risk factors for lung cancer such as smoking status.\u00c2\n\nThe associations between lung cancer risk and yogurt and fiber intake were also consistently found across males and females and the different ethnicities included in the study.\n\n\"Our study provides strong evidence supporting the U.S. 2015-2020 Dietary Guideline recommending a high fiber and yogurt diet,\" said senior author Xiao-Ou Shu, MD, PhD, MPH.\n\n\"This inverse association was robust, consistently seen across current, past and never smokers, as well as men, women and individuals with different backgrounds,\" she added.\n\n\n\nDietary fiber is a main source of prebiotics (indigestible compounds in food that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract) while yogurt is a good source of probiotics (live microorganisms that are thought to improve or restore the natural balance of bacteria), both of which have been linked to improved gut health and improvements in various health conditions.\n\nA diet high in fiber and yogurt has also been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal cancer.\n\n\n\n", "description": "New research has found that eating a diet which includes yogurt and is rich in fiber could help reduce the risk of lung cancer.
