Chuck Schumer (D-NY) quoted the retired Marine general when he said ISIS will become a threat again after U.S. troops withdrew from northern Syria.\n\n\"We have got to keep the pressure on ISIS so they don\u2019t recover. We may want a war over, we may even declare it over. You can pull your troops out, as President Obama learned the hard way out of Iraq, but the enemy gets a vote, we say in the military. If we don\u2019t keep pressure on, then ISIS will resurge. It\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back,\" Mattis explained during his interview on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.\n\nWhile speaking at the Al Smith Memorial Foundation dinner on Thursday, Mattis said Trump has called other successful people overrated as well.\n\n\"So I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly that sounds pretty good to me,\" Mattis said, further thanking Schumer for bringing up his concerns about ISIS during the meeting.\n\n\"And you do have to admit that between me and Meryl, at least we've had some victories,\" he added.\n\nMattis served as Trump's defense secretary until he was unable to convince Trump not to pull the U.S. military out of Syria last year. Though Mattis said he would leave the Department of Defense at the end of February in his letter of resignation, Trump replaced him with then-Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan at the beginning of 2019.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/17/2019 23:16:45PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/332/7802abb4-b126-44ef-b99b-59c0c5d8f48c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
