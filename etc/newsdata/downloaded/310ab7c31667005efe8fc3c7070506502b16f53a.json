It feels like we've been on a flight a lot shorter than that.\"\n\nQantas partnered with two Australian universities to monitor how jetlag affected the health of passengers and crew members as they crossed multiple time zones.\n\nREAD: World's longest flight will see these human guinea pigs spend 20-hours in the sky\n\nAfter boarding the flight, passengers set their watches to Sydney time and were kept awake until night fell in eastern Australia with lighting, exercise, caffeine and a spicy meal.\n\nSix hours later, they were served a high-carbohydrate meal, told to avoid screens, and the lights were dimmed to encourage them to sleep through the night.\n\nProfessor Marie Carroll, a researcher from Sydney University who conducted the experiment, told AFP that she expected the innovative approach would result in \"absolutely minimal\" jetlag.\n\n\"I expect that they will have a normal day today and a normal night's sleep tonight,\" she said, adding that she felt \"amazingly good\" considering the flight time.\n\n\"It's all an experiment to see if airlines can adjust their schedule of food, beverages, exercise and lighting to be in sync with the destination time.\"\n\nALSO WATCH: Electric planes and the world's longest-range single aisle airliner at the Paris Air Show\n\nThe four pilots on board - who rotated between flying duties - also wore devices that tracked their brain waves and alertness.\n\nThe Australian and International Pilots Association, which represents Qantas pilots, has raised concerns about whether pilots will get enough quality rest during ultra long-range flights to maintain peak performance.\n\nIt has called for a \"scientific long-term study\" into the impacts on crews.\n\nThe airline says the test journeys are just one facet of the work it is doing to ensure the flights are operated safely.\n\nQantas last year introduced the first direct service from the western Australian city of Perth to London, with the 17-hour journey one of the longest passenger flights in the world.\n\nWATCH: This will be one of the longest bridges in the world in 2024\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
