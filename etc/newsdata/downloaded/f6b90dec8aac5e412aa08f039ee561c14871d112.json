He could now have a good chance of winning. Go Nick! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2019\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in February, Sandmann\u2019s family accused the Post of making defamatory statements about him in its coverage of his highly publicized encounter with Native American activist Nathan Phillips in Washington, D.C., in January.\n\nVideo of the confrontation shows Sandmann, donning a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, appearing to stare and at times smile at Phillips as the activist banged a drum and sang at the Lincoln Memorial. Sandmann\u2019s Covington High School classmates can be seen filming the encounter.\n\nSome interpreted Sandmann\u2019s smile as a smirk meant to intimidate Phillips, who said the 16-year-old was blocking him. Sandmann has said he was simply trying to defuse the situation.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the Sandmann family accuses the Post of \u201ctargeting and bullying\u201d the teen in its articles about the incident because he\u2019s a \u201cwhite, Catholic student wearing a red \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 souvenir cap\u201d during a school field trip to the March for Life, an annual anti-abortion rally.\n\nThe family sought $250 million in damages.\n\nJudge William Bertelsman initially dismissed the lawsuit in July, ruling the 33 statements Sandmann filed the complaint over were not defamatory and were protected under the First Amendment.\n\nAfter reviewing an amended version of the lawsuit, Bertelsman ruled Monday that the case could proceed into the discovery phase, stating that \u201cjustice requires\u201d further review of three of the 33 statements the Sandmann family contends were libelous.\n\nThe statements in question involve Phillips\u2019 claim that Sandmann \u201cblocked\u201d him and \u201cwould not allow him to retreat.\u201d Sandmann\u2019s lawyers say Phillips \u201cdeliberately lied\u201d and that the Post should have done more to vet his claims.\n\nThe Post did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe Sandmann family has also sued CNN and NBC over their coverage of the incident. Both news organizations have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuits, which are pending.", "description": "A federal judge ruled that \"justice requires\" further review of a portion of the student's claims.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c6cb5ac3b000085046b7eb6.jpeg?cache=svdyzagxsb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
