Staying in that uniform sends such a terrible message. They really need to shut it down and give athletes a chance to train under someone new and fresh,\" she said.\n\nGoucher, silver medalist in the 10,000m at the world championships while training under Salazar in 2007, called for samples from Salazar's athletes to be retested.\n\n\"Every blood test should be retested. This is what needs to happen and then we can determine if there should be charges on athletes or not,\" she said.\n\n\"I know athletes there that are not doing anything wrong, but that's just the unfortunate situation about a conviction like this,\" Goucher said.\n\nSalazar was banned on Tuesday for four years for doping violations, when the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) announced the punishment for \"orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\".\n\nSalazar, a former world-class marathon runner, said he will appeal against the decision.\n\nGoucher first made claims of wrongdoing about Salazar in 2013 and subsequently testified about the matter at USADA hearings.\n\nEfforts by Reuters to contact Goucher on Sunday were not immediately successful.", "description": "Salazar whistleblower wants Nike Oregon Project shut down", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF96001_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
