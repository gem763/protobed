It was tough work out there,\" Low said at his press conference.\n\n\"We had to regroup after the red card, the team did well after the break, we did not concede and scored three goals.\n\n\"The decisive factor was that we increased the tempo in the second half and kept calm.\n\n(Image: TOMS KALNINS/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"This week was not easy, with all the injuries and everything. We stayed calm and scored, so we are pleased.\"\n\nAfter starting with Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen in the friendly 2-2 draw with Argentina last week, Manuel Neuer returned to the starting XI.\n\nAnd the Bayern Munich stopper felt that his side dealt with their numerical disadvantage well.\n\n\"We were down to 10 men after 15 minutes, which makes everything more difficult as you have to reset,\" Neuer said according to dfb.de .\n\n\"Because of that, I didn't think it was a bad performance.\n\n\"It was a matter of time when the goals would eventually come. At some point we put them away.\"", "description": "The Juventus midfielder was sent off after just 14 minutes in Tallinn", "authors": ["Press Association", "Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Martin Rose Bongarts Getty Images", "Toms Kalnins Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574500.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/11_Estonia-v-Germany-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
