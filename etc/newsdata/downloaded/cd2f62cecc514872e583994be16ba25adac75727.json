Previously, sitcom mums tended to be the calm centre in the storm of family life (Susan in My Family, Sue in Outnumbered, Clair in The Cosby Show, Jackie in Friday Night Dinner). There was nothing quite as thrillingly chaotic as Julia, played by Anna Maxwell Martin, attempting to buy black school shoes with her two kids in tow, on the last day before term starts, five minutes before the shop closes, as she does in the opening scene of Motherland season two. Nothing, in other words, that was truly honest about the experience of being a mother.\n\nTo Helen Linehan, one of the series\u2019 writers, the reason for this omission is obvious: who would want to watch a show about the stress of motherhood? \u201cFor me, all I wanted to do was just have a nice conversation about music or something and not bloody babies,\u201d she recalls of the time in her life when Motherland was first conceived, and she was a stay-at-home mother of two. \u201cBecause what everyone wants to talk about is their baby and it\u2019s the most boring subject.\u201d This is the kind of extreme boredom that can drive people to extreme behaviour, it turns out: \u201cSome of the antics that go on! Especially with PTAs. There\u2019ll be people in tears or there\u2019ll be fights and stuff and the behaviour is so bizarre that it wouldn\u2019t translate to telly, d\u2019you know what I mean? No one would believe you.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sharon Horgan. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nStill, Linehan thought there might be a sitcom in it. She and her husband, Graham Linehan (Father Ted, The IT Crowd), approached another writing team, Sharon Horgan and Holly Walsh, who had separately been working on a pilot with similar themes for US television. \u201cWe wrote a show for a US network about a mother who was struggling, fucking up, getting it wrong,\u201d explains Horgan. \u201cBy the time we came to shoot it she was 60% less of a mess. So it was 60% less funny. I think at that time there wasn\u2019t an appetite for mothers on screen who were saying this is all wrong or kicking back.\u201d\n\nThe four joined forces around their common idea. Unlike the many, less funny, family sitcoms that came before, Motherland would not be a show about how mothers relate to their offspring, or how mothers relate to fathers (both the children and the nominal co-parents are mostly off-screen). It would be about how mothers relate to each other. Maybe the day-to-day business of mothering is too boring for television, but motherhood? That\u2019s one of the most fascinating \u2013 and funny \u2013 life experiences there is.\n\nThree years on and Motherland\u2019s second series has started, with a third already commissioned. At the same time, an explosion of online parenting content \u2013 ranging from Insta-influencers to confessional \u201cslummy mummies\u201d \u2013 has helped both consolidate an audience for motherhood comedy and provide writers with a treasury of new material.\n\nMotherland is now one of several shows that present child-rearing from a woman\u2019s point of view. There are international takes, such as the Australian TV show The Letdown and Canadian series Workin\u2019 Moms; semi-autobiographical portraits of single motherhood, such as Pamela Adlon\u2019s Better Things and Frankie Shaw\u2019s SMILF; and even a sub-genre of heavily pregnant standup specials, including Ali Wong\u2019s Baby Cobra and Amy Schumer\u2019s Growing. The implicit promise of them all is that they will give it to us straight. Ali Wong on work-life balance, for instance: \u201cReal talk? I have a nanny. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the answer. Yes, it\u2019s very unlikable and unpopular to broadcast that because not everybody can afford a nanny, it\u2019s super-expensive. Both me and my husband have to hustle. We have to work very hard to not take care of our child ourselves.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alison Bell as Audrey in The Letdown. Photograph: ABC\n\nIn a relatively short time, motherhood has gone from a comedy blindspot to one of its favourite topics. For all the talk of funny women making waves, this might be the most compelling evidence yet of real progress towards equality: not only are women more numerous in creative roles, they have the power to get shows made about topics relevant to them, whether or not the menfolk are also laughing.\n\nIt is a trajectory that is also reflected in the Motherland writers\u2019 room, now that Graham, the show\u2019s sole male writer, has been replaced by writer-performer Barunka O\u2019Shaughnessy (Hunderby, Timewasters). Get four working mothers together in one room and you\u2019ll get four very different solutions to that hoary old conundrum: \u201cHow does she do it?\u201d\n\nMotherland\u2019s perspective is undeniably that of the comfortably-off London mum (it\u2019s set around Acton, west London) \u2013 but even within that specific stratum there are variations. Between the writers, they have children from toddler age to teens, experience of state and private schooling, stay-at-home parenting and various types of outsourced childcare. During the series, we\u2019re also reintroduced to super-stressed Julia who, early in season two, swaps a full-time event-planning job for working from home, but finds she\u2019s no less stressed. Alpha mum-turned-mumpreneur Amanda (Lucy Punch) might be more enviable if she wasn\u2019t so relentlessly judgmental about everyone else\u2019s choices. Single parent Liz (Diane Morgan) is a heroic source of dry wit and ingenious parenting shortcuts, but her income source remains mysterious. Then there\u2019s Kevin (Paul Ready), the stay-at-home dad who\u2019s recently taken on some work at soft-play centre Kiddiverse. \u201cIt\u2019s really great!\u201d he tells Liz during a school gate catch-up. \u201cPart-time, so I can still drop the kids, very average wage so Jill doesn\u2019t feel threatened \u2026 whole package, really!\u201d\n\nFor the second series, Motherland\u2019s horizons have been further expanded by the introduction of a new character. \u201cWhen I came, what I thought was missing was a character who\u2019s able to do everything,\u201d says O\u2019Shaughnessy. \u201cSo for me it was more about: well, who is this extraordinary character? And what can we do with her that makes her sort of slightly fallible.\u201d By this point the other writers had noticed an omission, too: people of colour. Series two introduces Meg (played by black British actor Tanya Moodie), a high-flying businesswoman who has five children. \u201cY\u2019know, that sort of Nicola Horlick template of motherhood,\u201d says O\u2019Shaughnessy. \u201cYou\u2019re always looking for a chink in their armour, because you\u2019re always comparing yourself.\u201d\n\nThe introduction of Meg goes some way to pre-empting any criticism of Motherland\u2019s narrow focus but, as O\u2019Shaughnessy acknowledges, there is a limit: \u201cI think if you want to tell a different side to motherhood you have to go to a different area and into a different class or, whatever, background, and you can cover that \u2026 There are other shows that are about the more vulnerable end of being a parent in this world but that\u2019s not our remit.\u201d\n\nIf Motherland\u2019s creators seem anxious to do their bit for inclusivity, that\u2019s understandable. You don\u2019t need to spend much time on Mumsnet to realise that the same properties that make motherhood such a bounteous topic for comedy also make it a touchy one. The \u201cmommy wars\u201d rumble on, on various fronts (breastfeeding v bottle-feeding, stay-at-home v working, sugar-free v reality etc), emotions run high and everyone is sleep-deprived. Even in the manuals and blogs designed to support parents, generalised observations can feel like personal digs. \u201cIt upsets me when we\u2019re not united in saying it\u2019s fucking hard,\u201d says Horgan. \u201cA girl at my daughter\u2019s school told her that her mum was worried I didn\u2019t spend enough time with my daughter and she just \u2018wishes\u2019 I was around more. Seriously, you take one job away from home four years ago! Anyway, now I want to give her a one-inch punch in her judge-y chops. Y\u2019know, I thought it was sort of funny. But I also thought that that kind of thing is so unhelpful. And feeding into a sort of sexist bias that puts all the responsibility on the mother, to be a certain type or project a certain image. Fuck that. Stick together and support each other. Your daughters need to see that.\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about the dads. Paul Ready, who plays Kevin, says he pushed to ensure that his character gets to \u201cwin a bit more\u201d this season. \u201cSocially, if the world is changing and we need more stay-at-home dads and there\u2019s going to be proper equality, then I think it\u2019s dangerous to have a stay-at-home dad who is just the butt of the joke,\u201d he says. Rest assured that Kevin\u2019s desperation to be part of the mum-crowd is still the butt of many jokes, and probably always will be. \u201cI think he always has to slightly lose,\u201d says Ready, \u201cor he wouldn\u2019t be Kevin any more.\u201d\n\nThe brutal reality of school-gate society is that excluding those who don\u2019t fit is an essential bonding ritual, and this is at the very core of Motherland. Indeed, excluding outsiders (all the characters are outsiders, in some sense) might be the only group-bonding method strong enough to bring together women who, as Walsh has joked, \u201chave nothing in common except the fact that you all had unprotected sex on the same weekend\u201d. That explains how the mud-flecked, military-influenced motto \u201cNo mum left behind\u201d gets taken up as series two\u2019s sometimes ironic, sometimes earnest rallying cry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of scripts lately dealing with these themes \u2013 the difficult, painful, often hilarious reality of parenting,\u201d says Lucy Punch, who plays Amanda. \u201cI think there\u2019s a trend and need in our culture right now for authenticity and honesty, not just in comedy \u2026 Those fantasy worlds that [once] existed \u2026 wouldn\u2019t feel relevant or work in the same way now.\u201d Not for Motherland, then, the mysteriously baby-free brunching of Sex and the City, or the perfectly coiffed labours of Friends. Instead, this season features those half-term holidays that end up being no kind of holiday at all, the manic #mumdrunk hedonism of a rare night out and the sweaty guilt of missing sports day.\n\nHow does Motherland transform such recognisably stressful events into an enjoyable half-hour of weeknight comedy? It\u2019s a question Linehan once asked herself: \u201cI thought: \u2018Would I want to sit down with a glass of wine and watch this? After wrangling my kids all day?\u2019\u201d Somehow it works, and Linehan has a theory: \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s just so extreme you think: \u2018Oh, thank God my life isn\u2019t like that!\u2019 When, actually, it nearly is.\u201d\n\nMotherland is on Mondays, BBC Two, 10pm", "description": "As the comedy about panicked parenting returns, its cast and writers discuss the difficulties of modern motherhood", "authors": ["Ellen E Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/306b50141aea7f0668edd0da07b08148156c288f/0_146_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9eaa17096975a4e6daf233466c57f55", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
