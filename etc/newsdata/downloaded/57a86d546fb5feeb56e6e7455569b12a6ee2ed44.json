He came and did a talk in 2017, where he spoke about his time as a manager, his philosophy, football, his ambitions.\n\n\"He spoke for over two hours in total, everyone was captivated by him. The most amazing thing about him is how humble he is.\"\n\nElson added that Klopp has continuously made donations since his visit and still holds a close relationship with the initiative.", "description": "Liverpool head coach Jurgen Klopp has been hailed after donating \u00a310 000 to the South African-based soccer initiative for children, Joy is Round.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2162/4bdedae8caba4e3aaf7188708fd18d05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
