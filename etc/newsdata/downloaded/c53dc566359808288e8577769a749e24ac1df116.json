We did get some leeway over the next three days and so we are off to Miyazaki for a short pre-season camp and then we are off to Oita.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We are Miyazaki beef consumers. We'll do a bit of light training Friday, have a good hit out Saturday, have some beef Saturday night, a few beers, and get ready for the week ahead.\n\n\"We can do a lot of different things. We are not concerned at all, we are excited, absolutely excited as it\u2019s a great opportunity. Who would have thought we would have two relatively easy games, one tough game and then two weeks to prepare for a quarter-final. So someone is smiling on us \u2013 the typhoon gods maybe?\"\n\nEngland will attempt to transport as much of their large equipment consignment to Miyazaki as possible, with the rest of the load going on to Oita to prepare for the quarter-final clash likely to be against Australia.\n\nHowever, while England are not concerned about the match cancellation, thousands of fans face World Cup heartbreak with the final weekend of pool matches heavily impacted.\n\nPlenty of fans have flown into Tokyo this week to watch England\u2019s match with France and Sunday\u2019s game between Japan and Scotland, yet now face the prospect of spending hundreds or thousands only to be told to stay indoors throughout the weekend, seeing no rugby in the process.\n\n\u201cI have just been walking around the streets and there are a lot of people with disappointed faces,\u201d Jones added. \u201cIt is difficult for them because it was going to be a special occasion and we feel for them and we are lucky to have such great supporters.\n\n\"It's not something you can control. This is the situation. I think it's a wonderful World Cup. You can't help typhoons, we would all like to think we've got the power above and beyond what's in the world at the moment, but we don't and these things happen and you just ride with it.\"", "description": "Eddie Jones believes the \u201cTyphoon Gods\u201d are looking down favourably on England\u00a0even though their final pool game against France\u00a0has been cancelled due to the threat of Typhoon Hagibis.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/07/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
