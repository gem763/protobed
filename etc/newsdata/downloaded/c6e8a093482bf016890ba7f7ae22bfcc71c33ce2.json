On the way to agreement, they put in safeguards requested by Nordic countries.\n\nThe Netherlands, Ireland and other Hansa countries reached across the currency divide to ally with noneuro countries Denmark and Sweden against France\u2019s integrationist plans.\n\nFrance was pushing for a credible cash pot to support reforms in eurozone countries and ultimately help absorb sudden economic shocks across the currency union.\n\nThe pushback leaves the eurozone budget with an expected and unofficial size of \u20ac17 billion over seven years, a far cry from French President Emmanuel Macron's initial goal of a budget equivalent to several percentage points of eurozone economic output.\n\n\n\nThe two biggest Nordic countries demanded assurance of being made whole, in case any of their EU contributions end up in eurozone programs.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that the cash pot\u2019s size will increase any time soon.\n\nFrance's plan was already facing a challenge from countries outside the eurozone over the budget instrument.\n\nThe Nordic countries were demanding \u2014 and are now set to win \u2014 some form of compensation to ensure they don\u2019t pay into programs from which they can\u2019t benefit. The outcome complicates the proposed Budgetary Instrument for Convergence and Competitiveness (BICC) while weakening its political and financial influence.\n\nThe Hague had already dialed down French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s original proposal in June. But even the scaled-back BICC raised concerns of fairness for other EU countries, Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said Thursday.\n\n\u201cI have sympathy ... for the proposal of particularly France,\u201d for a budget to strengthen the euro area, Hoekstra told journalists. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been equally sympathetic to Sweden and Denmark, who have vocalized that if they\u2019re not going to take part in it, then also they shouldn\u2019t receive a bill. Both asks to the group [of countries deciding on the budget] are just and fair.\u201d\n\nBICC \u2018n mix\n\nMinisters had gathered in Luxembourg to agree on the final nuts and bolts of the 19-nation BICC, before leaders sit down to final talks this month over the budget for all 27 EU countries. The euro instrument will be a component of the Europe-wide Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2021 to 2027.\n\nThe two biggest Nordic countries demanded assurance of being made whole, in case any of their EU contributions end up in eurozone programs.\n\n\"It was important to make it absolutely clear that Denmark and Sweden will not have to pay for this instrument,\" Denmark\u2019s finance minister, Nicolai Wammen, said Thursday morning on his way into a second day of meetings among the ministers.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how compensation would work but Eurogroup President M\u00e1rio Centeno promised the Scandinavians that it would happen.\n\nDenmark\u2019s and Sweden\u2019s ministers have their Hanseatic peers to thank for getting the deal they wanted. Eurozone countries in the group, such as Ireland and the Netherlands, agreed to support the Scandinavian calls for compensation in a closed-door meeting before the formal talks in the Eurogroup.\n\nWithout their support, their compensation claims likely would not have materialized, officials in the room told POLITICO.\n\n\u201cWe saw a huge sense of compromise among ministers so I don\u2019t think that anyone is detrimental to anything that we agree upon in the Eurogroup\u201d \u2014 Eurogroup President M\u00e1rio Centeno\n\nFrance saving face\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire put on a brave face Thursday.\n\n\u201cI just want to recall for all those full of skepticism or pessimism, two years ago when I was explaining the necessity of the eurozone budget there was no support for that idea and it was only an idea,\u201d Le Maire told reporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy about these major steps that we have reached yesterday,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cI think we are now not far from having concretely the eurozone budget that we were expecting.\u201d\n\nFrance failed to secure an intergovernmental agreement between eurozone governments that would allow them to top up the budget with the help of a financial transaction tax.\n\nMinisters instead agreed that eurozone countries could get a 70 percent refund for future projects that are backed by the budget. The amount they can spend depends on their population size and rate of economic growth.\n\nCompromise\n\nCenteno refused to blame the Nordics or Dutch for limiting the overall ambition of the budget that he brokered during the negotiations, which began in earnest last year.\n\n\u201cWe saw a huge sense of compromise among ministers so I don\u2019t think that anyone is detrimental to anything that we agree upon in the Eurogroup,\u201d he said Thursday at a press conference. \u201cThose decisions are very, very important, and very, very important decisions take a long, long time to take.\u201d\n\nLawmakers back in Brussels that oppose the eurozone budget were less diplomatic.\n\n\u201cFinance ministers have trimmed down Emmanuel Macron\u2019s megalomaniac ideas for a eurozone budget back to a realistic size,\" German conservative Markus Ferber said in a statement. \"After all, the new instrument is not meant to finance social spending of member states.\"\n\nHowever it\u2019s spent, Sweden and Denmark have also now assured they won\u2019t be financing it.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
