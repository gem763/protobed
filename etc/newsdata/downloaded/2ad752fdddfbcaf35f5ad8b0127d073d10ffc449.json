Mark Milley. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo\n\nPresident Donald Trump said yesterday that the dog had chased Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi into the tunnel where the terrorist leader then detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three children.\n\n\"Our K-9, as they call \u2014 I call it a dog, a beautiful dog, a talented dog \u2014 was injured and brought back,\" Trump said.\n\nAfter the Pentagon briefing, Trump tweeted a photo of the dog. \"We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nCommando units such as Delta Force, SEAL Team 6, and the 75th Ranger Regiment typically bring specially trained dogs on their missions, often German Shepherds or Belgian Malinois.\n\nThe dogs are outfitted with military equipment, including body armor and sometimes cameras, and are trained both to sniff out explosives and chase down fleeing terrorist fighters.\n\nThe dog that accompanied SEALs on the 2011 raid into Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden was named Cairo. Last December, a seven-year-old dog named Maiko was killed along with Army Sgt. Leandro Jasso during a Ranger raid in Afghanistan.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/62/81/3596dda74e8d9dc0f08b2025198d/20191027-baghdadi-dog-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
