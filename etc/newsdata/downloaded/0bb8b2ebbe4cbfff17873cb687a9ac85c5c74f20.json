He was subsequently accused of espionage and has been behind bars for nearly 10 months and counting.\n\nSpeaking in court during a public session Thursday from a cage reserved for criminal defendants, Mr. Whelan maintained his innocence and reiterated concerns about his ongoing detainment.\n\n\u201cRussia says it caught James Bond on a spy mission. In reality, they abducted Mr. Bean on holiday,\u201d Mr. Whelan told the court, as recorded on video by a BBC correspondent in the court.\n\n\u201cMy human rights are being violated, my life threatened, medical issues are being denied, and my property stolen,\u201d Mr. Whelan continued in the video clip. \u201cNo evidence of espionage has been provided, as it does not exist.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. State Department has similarly called on Russia to either provide evidence to support keeping Mr. Whelan imprisoned or to promptly release him from custody.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a bipartisan-sponsored resolution on Tuesday this week effectively proposing the same.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly asked the Russian government to give Paul Whelan a fair and transparent judicial process to no avail,\u201d said Rep. Haley Stevens, a Michigan Democrat and the House resolution\u2019s main sponsor. \u201cIf Russia cannot produce any evidence after keeping an American citizen detained for almost a year, they must release him immediately.\u201d\n\nMr. Whelan, a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, was employed as a security director for a Michigan-based automotive parts company at the time of his arrest. He was born in Canada to British parents before moving to Michigan as a child, and he holds Canadian, British, American and Irish citizenship.\n\nRussian investigators allege Mr. Whelan was arrested while possessing a USB drive containing classified information. Addressing reporters at a previous court hearing, Mr. Whelan said something was placed in his pocket by a Russian acquaintance moments before his arrest.\n\nMr. Whelan\u2019s trial is currently scheduled to start in 2020.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
