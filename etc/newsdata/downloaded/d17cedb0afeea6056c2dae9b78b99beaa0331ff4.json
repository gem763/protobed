With nothing. They come after me, but what they\u2019re really doing is they\u2019re coming after the Republican Party. And what they\u2019re really, really doing is they\u2019re coming after and fighting you, and we never lose.\u201d\n\nThe crowd applauded as Trump pursed his lips and surveyed the success of how the line had landed. It was a winner. It was a keeper.\n\nTrump was making himself into the voodoo doll of conservative politics: Whatever pain he felt, his supporters would feel, and they would object to it in unison.\n\nThere is no separation between the Republican Party and Donald Trump. In fact, Trump killed the old Republican Party and now he alone animates the zombie party that lurched forward after its death.\n\nThis is Trump\u2019s army. And he is warning his congressional generals, the lawmakers who protect and defend him, that there will be no defections, lest the army turn on them.\n\nAt least since August, Trump has been tweeting his stratospheric approval rating among Republicans every few days. That is less about informing than warning. This message is to Republican politicians, those who will hold his fate in their hands as the impeachment process unfolds, to stay in line and toe the line.", "description": "And an army is blindly following.", "authors": ["Charles M.
