That symbolizes the five demands of Hong Kong\u2019s latest protest movement for universal suffrage, amnesty for arrested demonstrators and other wishes.\n\nThe fate of his appeal was not immediately clear.\n\nLeung emerged as one of the figureheads of protest in Hong Kong after 2014\u2019s failed nonviolent demonstrations over Beijing\u2019s decision to restrict elections.\n\nAmong supporters who gathered outside the hearing was Kenny Lee, 23, who said Leung \u201chas inspired a lot of Hong Kong people, especially our young people.\u201d\n\nEven jailed, Leung\u2019s activism still resonates as Hong Kong is again gripped by protests that started in June and have snowballed.\n\n\u201cHe started spreading his idea a few years ago but at that time, not many people really understood him and some even criticized him,\u201d said J. Sze, a supporter in her twenties.\n\n\u201cNow, some people start to agree with his idea, maybe a little bit late,\u201d she said.\n\nLeung has been an advocate of independence for Hong Kong, which reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997. He was sentenced in June 2018 for his role in a Feb. 8-9, 2016, outbreak of violence in the city\u2019s working-class Mong Kok district.", "description": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Hundreds of masked protesters yelling \"Revolution Now!\" crammed the sidewalk in front of Hong Kong's High Court and spilled onto the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/e08b02_hong-kong-protests-94783-supporters-surround-police-bus-carrying-political-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
