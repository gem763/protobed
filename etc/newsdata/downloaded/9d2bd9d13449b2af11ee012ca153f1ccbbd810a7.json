New, exciting restaurants are popping up every other week, along with sleek bars that are enhancing the beloved pub scene.\n\nWith a decent variety of hotels on offer, it\u2019s easy to find a place that suits your needs, whether you\u2019re looking for a luxurious blowout or a budget crash pad. Be warned, though \u2013 hotels can fill up quickly, so it\u2019s worth booking at least a few months in advance.\n\nAs a hotel-obsessed travel writer who calls Dublin home, I have a hotlist of favourite spots in the city \u2013 places where you can rely on enviable interiors, a comfy bed and a big smile at check-in. Because if there\u2019s one thing that can be all but guaranteed in Dublin, it\u2019s a warm welcome.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Independent's hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust. On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nBest for history: The Shelbourne\n\nNeighbourhood: Stephen\u2019s Green\n\nThere\u2019s nowhere quite like The Shelbourne. The \u201cGrand Dame of Dublin\u201d opened in 1824, and still retains a feeling of old world luxury \u2013 the doormen are decked out in top hats, the ceilings drip with golden chandeliers and the rooms are kitted out with lust-worthy antiques. This is real special occasion territory, and it also plays a special role in Ireland\u2019s history \u2013 the Irish Constitution was drafted within these walls in 1922.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac260, B&B\n\nrenaissance-hotels.marriott.com/shelbourne-dublin-renaissance-hotel\n\nBest for luxury: The Merrion\n\nNeighbourhood: Merrion Street\n\nWhen it comes to sheer, unbridled luxury, you can\u2019t beat The Merrion. This is the place to go when you want to evoke that Lord of the Manor vibe, without ever leaving the city. The rooms are the ultimate in comfortable luxury \u2013 think plush, kitten-soft beds, corniced ceilings and marble bathrooms. Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, Ireland\u2019s only two Michelin-starred location, is right downstairs, and the pastries served in the Drawing Rooms for Afternoon Tea are artistic masterpieces.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac310, B&B\n\nthemerrion.com\n\nBest for budget: Grafton Guesthouse\n\nNeighbourhood: South Great George\u2019s Street\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Dublin can be tricky on a budget, particularly when it comes to hotels. But there are bargains to be found, without having to compromise on style. Grafton Guesthouse is something of a secret in the city. It's positioned right on the restaurant-heavy George\u2019s Street, and the rooms have a Nordic simplicity, with exposed brick walls and beams. It can be a little noisy at night, but if you\u2019re looking to join the party then you\u2019ll be in heaven.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac129, B&B\n\ngraftonguesthouse.com\n\nBest for the personal touch: Brooks Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Drury Street\n\nConsidering the reasonable enough room rates, there\u2019s a real sense of individualised attention to detail at the Brooks Hotel. There\u2019s a pillow menu on your bed, a free smartphone (with data) for you to use throughout your stay, and even a hotel book club, with a changing title each month. The residents\u2019 bar is a cosy little sanctuary, and there\u2019s a 26-seat cinema, with themed movie nights.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac190, B&B\n\nbrookshotel.ie\n\nBest for sophistication: Conrad Dublin\n\nNeighbourhood: Earlsfort Terrac\u0435\n\nStill basking in its \u20ac14 million renovation, the Conrad Dublin is one of the finest hotels in town. The rooms strike the perfect balance between style and comfort, with an emphasis on Irish heritage \u2013 think Foxford woven blankets on the beds and Irish art on the walls. Breakfast in The Coburg brasserie is a highlight, with a whole honeycomb at the buffet, cafetieres on every table and the fluffiest of pancakes cooked to order.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac299, B&B\n\nconradhotels3.hilton.com\n\nBest for cosiness: Number 31\n\nNeighbourhood: Leeson Close\n\nIf you weren\u2019t looking for Number 31, you\u2019d likely walk past it without noticing. Hidden away behind a tall garden wall, this Georgian townhouse is all about sumptuous, classic design, with original features that make architecture nerds weep with joy. There are just 21 bedrooms \u2013 opt for one in the townhouse rather than the modern mews, for their intricately carved ceilings and tall sash windows.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac215, B&B\n\nnumber31.ie\n\nBest for romance: Cliff Townhouse\n\nNeighbourhood: Stephen\u2019s Green\n\nMore of a restaurant with rooms than a hotel, the Cliff Townhouse is a gorgeous Georgian building overlooking Stephen\u2019s Green. There\u2019s a top-notch seafood restaurant downstairs, and nine classically elegant bedrooms upstairs \u2013 think velvet headboards, antique furniture and original fireplaces. After oysters in the Champagne Bar and a slap up seafood dinner, you\u2019ll be glad you only have to plod up a few stairs to your bed.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac170, B&B\n\nclifftownhouse.ie\n\nBest for partying: The Dean\n\nNeighbourhood: Harcourt Street\n\nIf you\u2019re in town for a good time, The Dean is the place for you. With a rooftop bar so buzzy it practically vibrates, and an in-house DJ in the lobby, this isn\u2019t the spot for a serene night away, but rather a crash pad for a night of partying. With their own record players and Smeg fridges, the rooms are the epitome of cool, and the Mod Pod rooms are often a steal.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac110, room only\n\nthedeandublin.ie\n\nBest for foodies: The Westbury\n\nNeighbourhood: Balfe Street\n\nIt\u2019s rare that a hotel restaurant attracts local diners, but at The Westbury, you\u2019ll always find Dubliners looking for a bite to eat. There\u2019s an opulent art deco vibe in WILDE, the light-filled restaurant dripping with greenery, and a sleeker, neighbourhood vibe in Balfes, but both offer exceptional food (and killer cocktails). Afternoon Tea in the Gallery is a practically an institution, and is excellent for people watching.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac350, B&B\n\ndoylecollection.com/hotels/the-westbury-hotel\n\nBest for business travellers: The Alex\n\nNeighbourhood: Fenian Street\n\nIf you\u2019re travelling for work, you\u2019re often lumbered with a soulless corporate hotel, with a personality as beige as the bedroom walls. Not so at The Alex, a recently renovated space that\u2019s chic, while still catering perfectly to a business traveller. There\u2019s a cool co-working space in the lobby, a coffee shop for quick caffeine fixes and a Mad Men-esque bar for those end of day cocktails.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac200, room only\n\nthealexdublin.ie\n\nBest for views: Aloft Dublin City\n\nNeighbourhood: Liberties\n\nIn the heart of the Liberties, the Aloft is a cool new hotel with light-filled rooms, sleek design and a space-age glass exterior. But really, this place is all about the view \u2013 the hotel\u2019s reception, along with a sprawling bar and little rooftop terrace, is all up on the seventh floor, giving you a panorama of the city. You can see the local cathedrals, various city landmarks, and even out to the Dublin Mountains. Dreamy.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac149\n\nmarriott.com/hotels/travel/dubal-aloft-dublin-city\n\nBest for art fiends: The Devlin\n\nNeighbourhood: Ranelagh\n\nIn the pretty district of Ranelagh, just a short tram ride from the city centre, The Devlin is the place to go if you want to see a different side of Dublin. The rooms are on the smaller side, but stylish and cleverly designed, with a handheld garment steamer and a Dyson hairdryer stored under the bed. Upstairs, the cocktail bar Layla\u2019s is great for sundowners or a boozy brunch, and there\u2019s a teeny art deco cinema in the basement, too.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac130\n\nthedevlin.ie\n\nBest for peace and quiet: The Wilder Townhouse\n\nNeighbourhood: Adelaide Road\n\nWith its gorgeous red brick exterior, plush rooms and stylishly cosy bar, The Wilder is the perfect hideaway in the city. All of the spaces are residents-only, so there\u2019s a pleasing aura of calm to the hotel, despite the fact it\u2019s only a short walk from the city centre. Each night, turndown service comes with a bedtime story of sorts, in the form of a book of Irish fairy tales or The Complete Short Stories by Oscar Wilde left on your pillow.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac160\n\nthewilder.ie", "description": "The best hotels in Dublin, from quirky boutiques to business-friendly properties, as chosen by our resident insider.", "authors": ["Nicola Brady"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/21/15/the-alex-restaurant-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
