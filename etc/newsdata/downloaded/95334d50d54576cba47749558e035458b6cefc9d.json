Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is usually pretty good with her marketing. You may not like what she has to say, but she at least has style. That's why it makes it all the more bizarre that she chose posters to advocate for her Green New Deal which as if they are right out of the Soviet Union's propaganda machine. AOC first revealed the posters on Twitter on Friday, and conservatives were quick to point out their likeness to communist flyers of old.\n\n\"Surprise!I am thrilled to announce the launch of our #GreenNewDeal art series with custom Bronx & Queens GND posters. The Bronx edition poster will be given for free as a limited release to the public at our Pelham Bay Nature Day & Backpack Giveaway in the Bronx tomorrow,\" Rep. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\n\"These posters push us to imagine our future with a Green New Deal in two of our beloved NY-14 parks: Pelham Bay & Flushing Meadows,\" she added. \"All our #GND posters are made in the US, union-printed & will be available for purchase soon, but available at organizing events now.\"\n\nThese posters push us to imagine our future with a Green New Deal in two of our beloved NY-14 parks: Pelham Bay & Flushing Meadows.\n\n\n\nAll our #GND posters are made in the US, union-printed & will be available for purchase soon, but available at organizing events now.\n\n\n\n/2 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 30, 2019\n\nTurning Point USA's Charlie Kirk pondered, \"Why does this seem like something the Soviet Union would post throughout the Red Square?\"\n\nWhy does this seem like something the Soviet Union would post throughout the Red Square? https://t.co/buxyph4kSV \u2014 Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) August 30, 2019\n\nThe Daily Wire's Harry Khachatrian stated, \"@AOC shares Soviet Union inspired propaganda posters to promote her 'Green New Deal'\"\n\n.@AOC shares Soviet Union inspired propaganda posters to promote her \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d https://t.co/fFOZPP9ycB pic.twitter.com/FWGHs95m1O \u2014 Harry Khachatrian (@Harry1T6) August 30, 2019\n\nThe Washington Examiner's Tom Rogan observed, \"These posters have a weirdly Soviet/Maoist/NoKo quality to them.\"\n\nThese posters have a weirdly Soviet/Maoist/NoKo quality to them. https://t.co/3ytSSvzEWM \u2014 Tom Rogan (@TomRtweets) August 30, 2019\n\nEven BuzzFeed's Miriam Elder noticed the similarity. \"I\u2019m not saying the Green New Deal poster that AOC just tweeted reminds me of the WWII statue in Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) but here we are\"\n\nI\u2019m not saying the Green New Deal poster that AOC just tweeted reminds me of the WWII statue in Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) but here we are pic.twitter.com/FjB14jmzXz \u2014 Miriam Elder (@MiriamElder) August 30, 2019\n\nI'm not saying AOC did this on purpose, but it probably isn't a great idea to have communism be the first thing that people think of when they look at posters for a new economic proposal which overhauls every aspect of your life and the economy.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:23:45AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/ebe9f581-d135-4da5-82b2-82233f072c4a.png"}
