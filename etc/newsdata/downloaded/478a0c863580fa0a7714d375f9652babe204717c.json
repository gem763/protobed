When your landline and cell phone were free from scam artists selling something, threatening you with arrest, wheedling to extract a credit-card number?\n\nNah, we can\u2019t either. The number of unwanted calls in the U.S. is measured in the tens of billions each year. The Federal Communications Commission, citing private analyses, says American consumers were hit with almost 4 billion robocalls a month in 2018.\n\nStill, there is cause for skeptical optimism on this front, even though the odds seemed perpetually stacked in favor of scammers who\u2019ve perfected the art of the auto-dial.\n\nIn July the U.S. House of Representatives adopted the Stop Bad Robocalls Act, which would require telecom companies to step up enforcement and give consumers more ways to insulate themselves. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., coasted through on a 429-3 vote. It\u2019s now before the Senate.\n\nA week ago a group of state attorneys general - including Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gurbir Grewal of New Jersey - announced an agreement they\u2019d reached with the 12 largest phone service providers. The companies, including Verizon, Comcast, T-Mobile and AT&T;, signed on to offer free call-blocking services to customers. They agreed to keep a closer watch on robocalls and help authorities identify and track phone scammers.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is stepping up enforcement. Working with federal, state and local investigators, the FTC recently announced charges against three firms and one individual believed to be responsible for more than 1 billion illegal spam calls.\n\nWhile this qualifies as a start, there\u2019s more to be done. Not all robocalls and phone solicitations are illegal, but the system has been gamed by those who have mastered easy-to-use technology, often operating from safe havens overseas.\n\nThe best hope rests with the industry - with government oversight to check on compliance. Several companies have taken steps to install an anti-\u201cspoofing\u201d technology called STIR/SHAKEN, which allows consumers with caller ID to know if an incoming calls is bona fide or a spammer using a local or familiar number.\n\nAnd there are call-blocking apps that can be downloaded, some for free.\n\nState and federal \u201cDo Not Call\u201d registries are still accepting numbers and trying to help, but we know from experience they don\u2019t provide anything close to a firewall. People can still report robocalls to the feds at ftc.gov/calls.\n\nWe need a unified effort - government, industry and individual - to make a dent in the extortion-by-phone business. No one is expecting total peace and quiet, but we should be able to \u201cweaponize\u201d the consumer, to help neutralize the criminal on the other end of the line. Seeing some of the worst offenders talking to themselves in prison would be rewarding, too.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2lEpyXR\n\n___\n\nKeep learning from tragedy of World War II\n\nThe Reading Eagle\n\nSept. 3\n\nThis week marks the 80th anniversary of the 1939 German invasion of Poland, the event that marked the beginning of World War II. It\u2019s an occasion that must remain strong in the world\u2019s collective memory, even as we slowly lose the people who can speak of it from firsthand experience.\n\nWithin days of the Sept. 1 invasion, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada declared war on Germany. The coming years would see more nations invaded and more countries involved in an escalating global conflict. By the time the war ended about six years later, it had claimed the lives of about 80 million people.\n\nFor Poland, however, memories of the invasion are about far more than its importance in the larger context of the war. That nation was struck with overwhelming force by the Nazi regime. To make matter worse, the Soviet Union also invaded, as dictator Josef Stalin had made a deal with Adolf Hitler to divide the country between them. Poland alone lost some 6 million citizens during the war, including some 3 million Polish Jews. And as several speakers noted during weekend commemorations of the invasion, the Nazis\u2019 goal was not just to control the country but to devastate its people and wipe out its culture.\n\nBut Sunday\u2019s ceremonies also send a heartening message to a world embroiled in conflicts that remind many of the era leading up to World War II. Though the unthinkable horrors inflicted during that war remain in living memory, the presidents of Germany and Poland were able to stand side by side and express a message of unity. There was contrition from the German side and forgiveness from the Poles.\n\n\u201cI bow my head before the Polish victims of German tyranny and I ask forgiveness,\u201d said German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. \u201cWe are deeply grateful for Poland\u2019s hand extended in a gesture of forgiveness.\u201d\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda said German leaders facing the difficult historical truth \u201chas the power to bring forgiveness and the power of building friendships.\u201d\n\nEven as we acknowledge that there are still disagreements between Poland and Germany over matters relating to the war, particularly as it concerns reparations, the fact that these former bitter enemies have become friends and allies should send a message to the rest of us in this world riven by conflicts large and small: Reconciliation is possible no matter how difficult the situation.\n\nWorld War II also teaches us that the opposite approach to reconciliation can lead to consequences far too painful to even contemplate. We pray that the world will not forget these lessons.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2kfTSrL\n\n___\n\nEducating ourselves on the deadly dangers of fentanyl\n\nLNP\n\nSept. 3\n\nTHE ISSUE\n\n\u201cAn East Hempfield Township man who was charged last year for his part in a fentanyl-laced heroin bust that involved $50,000 worth of the drug\u201d has been sentenced to six to 30 years in prison, LancasterOnline staff reported Aug. 13. Meanwhile, authorities stated that \u201ca Lancaster County Drug Task Force bust of a Manheim man resulted in the seizure of 220 bags of fentanyl,\u201d LancasterOnline reported Aug. 23. Finally, The Associated Press reported late last week that law enforcement officials in Virginia took down a multistate drug ring that was in possession of \u201cenough cheap fentanyl from China to kill 14 million people.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with a fentanyl primer, as many of us must educate ourselves on this drug and its immense dangers.\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a federal research institute: \u201cFentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. It is a prescription drug that is also made and used illegally. Like morphine, it is a medicine that is typically used to treat patients with severe pain, especially after surgery. It is also sometimes used to treat patients with chronic pain who are physically tolerant to other opioids.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called fentanyl the deadliest drug in America.\n\nFentanyl in prescription form most often comes as a shot, a patch or lozenges that are sucked like cough drops, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It\u2019s different, though, in its illegal street form. Those doses come \u201cas a powder, dropped onto blotter paper, put in eye droppers and nasal sprays, or made into pills that look like other prescription opioids.\u201d Its illegal forms can have street names such as Apache, China Girl, China White, Dance Fever, Friend, Goodfellas, Jackpot, Murder 8, and Tango & Cash.\n\nEven worse, some street dealers mix cheaper fentanyl with other drugs because it takes very little to produce a high. As the National Institute on Drug Abuse notes, \u201cThis is especially risky when people taking drugs don\u2019t realize they might contain fentanyl as a cheap but dangerous additive.\u201d\n\nIllegal forms of fentanyl are widely available in Lancaster County and southcentral Pennsylvania. The drug is shattering lives, tearing families apart and killing our neighbors.\n\nOn Friday, the official Twitter account for Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman sent out this alert: \u201cWe are receiving information from emergency responders about a spike in overdose incidents in Lancaster County over the past week or so.\u201d\n\nAnd, earlier this summer, the district attorney\u2019s office issued an advisory about blue pills that appear to be prescription medicine but are actually pressed fentanyl tablets that can be deadly. Some of the pills are blue, are stamped with \u201cM\u201d and \u201c30,\u201d and can look similar to Percocet tablets, LNP\u2019s Lindsey Blest reported.\n\nStedman\u2019s office is working aggressively to put those who sell or deliver fatal doses of fentanyl behind bars.\n\nOne of the most recent cases, reported on LancasterOnline on Friday, involved a Lancaster Township man who was sentenced to seven to 15 years in prison for providing a fentanyl-laced heroin batch that caused a Conestoga Township man to overdose and die in 2017. Prior to his sentencing, the man told the court, \u201cI lost everything I had, but nothing compared to losing a loved one.\u201d\n\nSo far this year in Lancaster County, 47 people have died of an overdose, according to data from OverdoseFreePa, a statewide online database. Of those deaths, 36 involved fentanyl.\n\nFentanyl knows no demographic barriers. On Friday, it was reported by the AP that Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs, who died July 1, had fentanyl and oxycodone in his system, along with alcohol.\n\nCertainly, this is one of the most insidious drugs we\u2019re dealing with in battling the opioid epidemic.\n\nOne thing we can do is watch for signs of fentanyl use or addiction by friends and family members.\n\nThe drug\u2019s effects, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, can include extreme happiness, drowsiness, nausea, confusion, constipation and sedation. And when someone is attempting to stop using the drug, he or she may experience muscle pain, sleeping problems, diarrhea, vomiting, cold flashes and severe cravings. \u201cThese (withdrawal) symptoms can be extremely uncomfortable and are the reason many people find it so difficult to stop taking fentanyl,\u201d the National Institute on Drug Abuse noted.\n\nHelp is available, though. For ourselves and our loved ones.\n\nPennsylvanians can call 800-662-HELP (4357) for information about treatment resources in battling drug problems. It is completely confidential. The hotline, staffed by trained professionals, is available 24/7 in both English and Spanish.\n\nWe should educate ourselves and especially our children about the great dangers of fentanyl. That knowledge could save a life.\n\nAnd we urge those who are suffering from opioid addiction or those who have a loved one dealing with an addiction to seek help immediately.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2m0SWIl\n\n___\n\nWalmart step begins journey\n\nScranton Times-Tribune\n\nSept. 4\n\nGun rights absolutists likely will scoff at Walmart\u2019s decision to end the sale of certain types of ammunition following yet another mass murder in Texas over the Labor Day weekend.\n\nBut the chain\u2019s decision is important even though the types of ammunition at issue are available elsewhere.\n\nThe key to diminishing U.S. gun violence is finally to apply some reason to the nation\u2019s anything-goes gun culture, which is a matter beyond the law itself. There are many parallels. Gradual changes in the culture, rather than any particular law, drove down U.S. smoking rates, for example.\n\nWalmart long has been a part of the gun culture. Its decision to stop selling the types of ammunition used in military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, while continuing to sell weapons and ammunition used for hunting, and to ask its customers not to carry weapons openly in Walmart stores, itself is a major statement. It emphasizes that the right to bear arms, like every right, comes with limits and responsibilities - including the responsibility to put public safety on an equal footing with the right to gun ownership.\n\nSensible people naturally look to their elected state and federal legislatures to protect public safety. But changing the culture at the grass-roots is the surest guarantee that elected politicians finally will act in the public interest.\n\nLike the Dick\u2019s sporting goods chain before it, Walmart has recognized its responsibility. Pressure on their competitors to follow suit would further the process of changing the culture from the bottom up, making it politically safe for politicians to protect public safety.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2lUcGgp\n\n___\n\nRegulate license plate readers: Police tech is ripe for due process violations\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nSept. 4\n\nMuch like facial recognition technology, automated license plate readers are becoming a popular new tool of law enforcement.\n\nAnd, like facial recognition, the use of plate readers has developed faster than the regulations governing their use, meaning there are no consistent limits on the technology and its application. That has opened the door for potential misuse that threatens both privacy and due process.\n\nDeveloped about 10 years ago, the popularity of license plate readers has been rising in the past two years. They have been deployed by the hundreds across Pennsylvania and by the thousands across the country, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital privacy nonprofit.\n\nLicense plate readers are typically mounted in police cars or on stationary objects like bridges or road signs. They use high-speed cameras to capture thousands of license plates per minute. The readers automatically run each plate through a state database, checking for violations or warrants related to the vehicle. Police officers are alerted to such matters as an unpaid fine to outstanding warrants.\n\nWhere is the due process? Historically, police need probable cause to pull over a person and to run a check on his or her plates.\n\nAuthorities can cast this broad net using the same legal rationale that is used for a DUI checkpoint: Everyone is subject to the same level of scrutiny.\n\nBut, the massive scope of this information-collecting technology pushes the practice into new and concerning circles.\n\nThen there\u2019s this question: What becomes of all that information - the photos, geolocation information and database checks? Local policies vary with communities setting their own standards for where the information is stored, who has access to it, how long it is stored and how it is used.\n\nSome communities in Pennsylvania have set their own standards for the use and storage of data collected by the readers. For example, some municipalities store data for days, others for months.\n\nHouse Bill 317, proposed recently by state Rep. Greg Rothman, R-Cumberland County would set statewide rules and regulations that would lend consistency in the use, storage and access of information collected from automatic license plate readers. Mr. Rothman proposed a similar bill last year that was passed by the House, but it died in the Senate.\n\nHB 317 moves in the right direction but not quite to where it needs to be. For example, it proposes that municipalities be allowed to store data collected by the readers for a year before it must be purged. This is too long. A better model is Allegheny County, which stores the information for just 10 days.\n\nThe threat to civil liberties is plain: Drivers are being documented and meticulously analyzed by police equipment without their knowledge or their consent, without probable cause or due process. It is done in the name of community safety, convenience and economies. But at what cost?\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2lVlId6\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Recent editorials of statewide and national interest from Pennsylvania's newspapers:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": ""}
