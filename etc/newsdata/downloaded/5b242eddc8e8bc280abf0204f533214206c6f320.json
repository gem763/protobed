The family members said they were stopped by a U.S. agent, were denied a request to return to Canada and instead were sent to a family detention center in Pennsylvania, where they are being held pending deportation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCBP officials disputed the family\u2019s version of events and said the Connors were spotted via video surveillance \u201cslowly and deliberately driving through a ditch onto Boundary Road in Lynden, Washington,\u201d between parallel roadways on the U.S. and Canadian sides. The roads are not connected by cross streets, and the only legal way to traverse between the countries is through staffed border stations throughout the region.\n\nCambria could not immediately be reached Tuesday for comment.\n\nThe CBP statement said U.S. agents also determined that two of the family members had applied for travel authorization to visit the United States and were denied. A senior CBP official said the Connors applied for visa waivers last year, and it was not immediately clear why they were rejected.\n\nAD\n\nSuch waivers are available to British passport holders and other foreign nationals from countries for which the United States has less-restrictive visa requirements.\n\nAD\n\nThe official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the case, said the family \u2014 four adults and three small children \u2014 had $16,000 in cash at the time of their arrest.\n\n\u201cAttempts were made to return the individuals to Canada, however, Canada refused to allow their return and two attempts to contact the United Kingdom consulate were unsuccessful,\u201d the CBP statement read.\n\nThe CBP official said it was not clear why Canada refused to let the family back into the country.\n\nAt that point, the official said, \u201cby law and procedure we have to turn them over to ICE,\u201d or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAD\n\nEileen Connors, 24, filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security inspector general Friday, alleging that her family, including her 3-month-old son, has spent more than a week living in \u201cfrigid\u201d and \u201cfilthy\u201d conditions at the Berks Family Residential Center in Leesport, Pa.\n\n\u201cWe will never forget, we will be traumatized for the rest of our lives by what the United States government has done to us,\u201d Connors wrote in a sworn statement. \u201cWe have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights, and lied to,\u201d she wrote, calling the ordeal \u201cundoubtedly the worst experience we have ever lived through.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Records show that the family had been previously denied U.S. travel authorization.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vfaF1TUll0Xk-NKHZQvDob2ztUo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PK7TGZHPRII6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
