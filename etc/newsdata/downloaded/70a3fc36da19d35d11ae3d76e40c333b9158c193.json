It\u2019s a good thing, then, that a job listing has just opened up for a \u2018fur butler\u2019.\n\nThe St. Regis Aspen Resort in Colorado is looking for someone to take care of its resident Bernese Mountain dog, Kitty.\n\nKitty is the hotel\u2019s mascot and he (yep, not a girl) needs some serious pampering. The job of the fur butler is to cater to his every need.\n\nAs part of the listing, the day-to-day activities include walks, airport greetings, playdates, and more.\n\nBut if you\u2019re the kind of person who prefers four-legged friends over humans then you probably won\u2019t mind answering to his beck and call too much.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, we love dogs and they love us so what better boss is there to work for?\n\nYou\u2019ll need to tend to Kitty\u2019s every beck and call (Picture: kittythebernese)\n\nThe job isn\u2019t just suited to dog lovers, as the butler will be in charge of the entire Pet Programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lucky candidate will get to look after all the pets staying at the resort.\n\nBonus points if you\u2019re a snow bunny as it is a ski resort. You might even get to do some snowboarding and sledding in your downtime.\n\nBut the main role consists of taking care of Kitty.\n\nA job description has been posted on Facebook, saying: \u2018The Fur Butler\u2019s success is rooted in a deep passion for animals, service, uncompromising standards, the ability to anticipate needs, and impeccable interpersonal skills.\n\n\u2018The Fur Butler will be expected to be comfortable and calm with pet restroom activity.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d add that you probably need strong inter-species skills too\u2019.\n\nOh, and you\u2019ll have to take lots of pics of Kitty too. Staying in a five-star hotel, chilling with some dogs \u2013 you probably don\u2019t need that reminder to take lots of pics.\n\nIf all that\u2019s got you saying \u2018yep, it\u2019s for me\u2019 then shoot over an email to kitty@stregis.com.\n\nGood luck.\n\nMORE: Get paid \u00a3770 to watch Disney movies every day for a month\n\nMORE: A dog who has to wear sunglasses to go outside is looking for her forever home\n\nMORE: Mum makes dining set look like new with paint and chair covers that cost under \u00a33 each\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The\u00a0St. Regis Aspen Resort in Colorado is looking for someone to take care of its resident Bernese Mountain dog, Kitty.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93874100_1572427102.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
