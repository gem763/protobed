From 2013, they decided to take a closer look at the greater sea snake to better understand its importance to the bay\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nChris the Merino sheep famed for his record-breaking fleece has died Read more\n\n\u201cThe study zone is in the most touristic bay in Noumea, so I often meet people when I am doing field work on sea snakes,\u201d Goiran said. \u201cWhen I was snorkelling on my own studying sea snakes, I used to meet a friend of mine called Aline that was snorkelling and taking photos on the same reef. In order to help me, she started taking photos of sea snakes and would send them to me by mail.\n\n\u201cI was very happy, so she asked her neighbour and friend Monique to help me too. Monique asked another friend, and soon there were seven grandmothers helping me.\u201d The group named themselves \u201cthe fantastic grandmothers\u201d and range in age from 60 to 75.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The \u2018fantastic grandmothers\u2019: (L-R) Genevi\u00e8ve Brian\u00e7on, Aline Gu\u00e9mas, Monique Zannier, Monique Mazi\u00e8re, Sylvie H\u00e9bert, Cathy Le Bouteiller and Marilyn Sarocchi in the Baie des citrons in Noumea.

Goiran and Shine have now published a paper in the journal Ecosphere revealing there are more than 250 greater sea snakes in the bay. Greater sea snakes have distinctive markings, allowing individuals to be easily identified from photographs.\n\n\u201cEven when I am stuck at university with teaching, I know what is going on in the study zone because the grandmas survey the zone for me and send me the photos,\u201d Goiran said.\n\n\u201cRemarkably,\u201d Shine added, \u201cthe grandmothers found a large number of lethally toxic sea snakes in a small bay that is occupied every day by hordes of local residents and cruise\u2010ship passengers \u2013 yet no bites by the species have ever been recorded at Baie des Citrons, testifying to their benevolent disposition.\u201d\n\nThey said the findings mean the role the snakes play in the functioning of the ecosystem is more important than previously thought. Scientists believe the snakes likely play a role in nutrient cycling through coral reefs, but there is little research available.\n\nWould this work have been possible without help from the citizen scientist grandmas?\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Goiran said. However it was hard to get all seven in the group going out at the same time, she said, because \u201cthere is always at least one away hiking, biking, sailing, taking yoga class or taking care of the grandkids\u201d.\n\nAustralia's birds: pretty and sweet or just a pack of bastards? | Sean Dooley Read more\n\nOne of the grandmothers, Aline Gu\u00e9mas, said she was not scared of the greater sea snakes despite their potential deadly bite. The grandmothers always keep their distance and never touch them. \u201cThat\u2019s the job of the boss,\u201d Gu\u00e9mas said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A close encounters between one of the grandmothers and the greater sea snakes in Baie des Citrons in Noumea. Photograph: Claire Goiran/UNC\n\nHer job was just to take videos and photos. Other members of the group helped with identifying the snakes and documenting their characteristics. The sea snakes could move quickly, making taking photographs difficult at times. But Gu\u00e9mas said \u201cthey are very slow in their movements when they forage for food\u201d, making those times ideal for photography.\n\nHer friend in the group, Sylvie Shebert, said she was afraid of the snakes at first but has grown to appreciate them. \u201cIt has been interesting to learn about and discover their lifestyle and to work with the group,\u201d she said. \u201cIt allows us to integrate our swimming with the scientific world by sharing the results of what we find with the researchers, such as the area where the snake is located, it\u2019s condition such as if it is pregnant or not, that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nMonique Mazi\u00e8re said \u201cthe snakes are not aggressive, just curious\u201d.\n\n\u201cOf course, we will never touch them.\u201d", "description": "Women\u2019s photography of greater sea snake, once believed to be an anomaly in the Baie des Citrons, help scientists understand the ecosystem", "authors": ["Melissa Davey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9590ba3c1f3793baaf3d52ba2fdb71a505061fb/0_478_4170_2503/master/4170.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc6b2ff9bd9c3555f55a5d393f37c539", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
