Last summer, Mr. Netanyahu declared that Arab Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up a fifth of the population, were to be second-class citizens, officially. \u201cIsrael is not a state of all its citizens,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu wrote on Instagram after passing the Nation-State law. \u201cAccording to the basic nationality law we passed, Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people \u2014 and only it.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli government has done everything in its power to reject those of us who are Arab Palestinian citizens, but our influence has only grown. We will be the cornerstone of democracy. Arab Palestinian citizens cannot change the course of Israel alone, but change is impossible without us. I have argued earlier that if the center-left parties of Israel believe that Arab Palestinian citizens have a place in this country, they must accept that we have a place in its politics.\n\nToday, those parties no longer have a choice. At least 60 percent of the Arab Palestinian citizens have voted in the recent elections and the Joint List, our coalition representing Arab and Arab-Jewish parties, has won 13 seats and become the third-largest list in the Knesset. We will decide who will be the next prime minister of Israel.", "description": "The leader of the Arab Joint List explains why it will use its power to help make Benny Gantz prime minister of Israel.", "authors": ["Ayman Odeh"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/opinion/22odeh2/22odeh2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
