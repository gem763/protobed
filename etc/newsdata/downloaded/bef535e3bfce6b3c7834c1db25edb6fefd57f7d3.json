Chelsea\u2019s never claimed to be a woman of the people, or salt of the earth, or humble or anything. For most of her adult life, she\u2019s lived her life and avoided the public spotlight.\u201d Now Chelsea Clinton is in the public spotlight and we\u2019re being instructed to think of her as extraordinary, without any good answers about what she\u2019s done, or what she would have done, without her father\u2019s name or her mother\u2019s influence.", "description": "You may recall one of my persistent gripes is the media\u2019s insistence that we treat Chelsea Clinton as if she\u2019s some sort of extraordinary achiever, when in fact she\u2019s \u201ca young woman whose adult life consists mostly of stepping through doors ...", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
