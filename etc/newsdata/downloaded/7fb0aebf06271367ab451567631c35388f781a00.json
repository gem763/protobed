He was in court for the sentencing hearing, but left along with several other people when recordings of the events were played.\n\nA police helicopter followed the stolen police car which was eventually stopped by officers\n\nHussain, pictured, was sentenced to 12 years in jail after pleading guilty to a dozen charges\n\nMr Smith said of Hussain, who attempted to shift the Range Rover back into gear after it was blocked in and surrounded by officers in Moorcroft Road, Moseley: 'He remained resistant even when a Taser device was used against him.\n\n'In fact he tried to remove the barbs of the fired Taser from his skin.'\n\nPolice body-cam footage played to the hearing showed Ghafoor being handcuffed and pinned to the ground near the Range Rover as Hussain emerged from the driver's door.\n\nHussain was then filmed struggling with officers, Mr Smith said, adding: 'He began to get out of the car and was determined to use his physical strength to resist the police officers.\n\nMubashar Hussain, left, and Ahsan Ghafoor, right were in a Range Rover when it was stopped by police. Hussain was jailed for 12 years and Ghafoor was sentenced to 28 months\n\n'Mr Hussain was described as looking in a rage and fired up. He reached the unmarked police car behind the Range Rover, despite being Tasered once more.'\n\nThe police car - which had been left with its engine running due to the swift nature of the events - began to reverse after Hussain got into the driver's seat, the court heard.\n\nMr Smith added: 'Mr Hussain then drove forward over the pelvic region of Pc Phillips before accelerating up Moorcroft Road.\n\n'The effect was immediately distressing. This was an extremely shocking and frightening incident for all of the police officers involved.'\n\nDescribing the footage shown to the court, the prosecutor continued: 'This series of recordings capture the critical events in a manner that requires no detailed commentary.'\n\nHussain reversed over PC Gareth Phillips, pictured, who suffered life-changing injuries after being struck by the BMW in Birmingham on August 12\n\nPc Phillips suffered serious injuries after Hussain ran over his pelvic area in the stolen BMW\n\nHussain tried to hide out in a dessert shop after abandoning the police car and tried to fight off chasing officers\n\nThis is CCTV footage of Hussain attempting to escape into a dessert shop in Birmingham\n\nOfficers stopped the stolen Range Rover, centre, but Hussain was able to escape and stole an unmarked BMW police car\n\nDuring the recordings, one officer could be heard urging a colleague to handcuff Hussain, moments before an 'officer down' message requesting an ambulance was relayed.\n\nHussain, of no fixed address, was arrested in the Sparkbrook area by armed police after abandoning the police car and heading into a dessert shop, where he disguised himself in an apron and then punched a chasing officer.\n\nThe banned driver has admitted causing grievous bodily harm, two counts of vehicle theft, dangerous driving, two counts of driving while disqualified, two counts of assault, assaulting an emergency worker, aggravated vehicle-taking, and two charges of having no insurance.\n\nGhafoor, 24, of Fulham Road, Sparkhill, has admitted dangerous driving, having no insurance and driving other than in accordance with a licence.\n\nSentencing Hussain, Judge Mark Wall QC said: 'You are a habitual dangerous driver. The level of your offending is increasing and not diminishing.'\n\nHussain's co-defendant, Ahsan Ghafoor, who threw a brick towards a police car, was jailed for 28 months after admitting two counts of car theft and three other offences including dangerous driving.\n\nJudge Wall told Hussain he will serve at least two-thirds of the 12-year sentence - and be required to spend an extended five-year period on licence following his eventual release.", "description": "Officers tasered Mubashar Hussain, left, who managed to escape in an unmarked police car while his accomplice Ahsan Ghafoor, right, was arrested.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/17/19749826-0-image-a-27_1571155881849.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
