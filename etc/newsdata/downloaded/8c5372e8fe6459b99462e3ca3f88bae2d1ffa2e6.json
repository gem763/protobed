Revenue dropped 10% from a year earlier to THB110.33 billion.\n\nThe company said it booked a deferred tax assets reversal of THB1.06 billion and an asset impairment of THB762 million on its offshore ceramics business. It noted the affect of the global trade war, which it said softened demand for its products and cut into margins for its chemicals business.\n\nSiam Cement said its ceramic-tiles business was flat across Southeast Asia as a whole, punctuated by weak demand in Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nWrite to Ben Otto at ben.otto@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 28, 2019 03:22 ET (07:22 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
