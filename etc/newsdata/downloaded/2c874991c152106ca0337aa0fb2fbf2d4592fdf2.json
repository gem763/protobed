That\u2019s a lie.", "language": "en", "text": "Giuliani\u2019s entire approach is built on disinformation and the manipulation of facts. Giuliani has developed a conspiracy theory in which he depicts my revelations about Manafort as an intervention in the 2016 U.S. election in favor of the Democratic Party. In his May interview on Fox, Giuliani even claimed that I was convicted of a corresponding crime.\n\nThe facts do not support this allegation. Here\u2019s the truth: The administrative court \u2014 which has long had a reputation as the most corrupt in Ukraine \u2014 ruled in December 2018 that I had acted illegally by disclosing the payments to Manafort. We appealed, and the verdict was suspended. And in the summer of this year, we won the appeal and the court\u2019s decision was completely annulled. The court concluded that all the charges against me were unfounded, and even obliged my opponents to reimburse me for $100 in legal costs.\n\nBut Giuliani continues to quote this court decision even though it never attained legal force.", "description": "", "authors": ["Serhiy Leshchenko", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Why-Is-Rudy-Giuliani-Trying-Drag-My-Countrys-President-Into-Trumps-Reelection-Campaign"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
