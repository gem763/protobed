To see a plant grow from a cutting into a fully formed plant, to see the sprouts of new leaves, to see flowers budding, and to know that it was all because of my tender care gives me a profound sense of calm. I keep buying new plants \u2014 slowly but surely, my apartment is being overtaken. Mutazione is about growing plants, and more importantly, it\u2019s about finding that feeling of calm.\n\nFor frame of reference, here are my darling plants.\n\nIn the game, high school student Kai is sent to the island of Mutazione to meet her dying grandfather. Mutazione was hit with a meteor half a century prior to the events of the game, and the remaining inhabitants mutated into humanoid but inhuman creatures. It sounds scary, but really, they\u2019re just trying to keep their little island community alive, despite the suspicion and fear from the mainland.\n\nKai\u2019s grandfather wasn\u2019t a mutant \u2014 he came to Mutazione as a scientist and then just stayed there. As Kai gets to know him, she learns a more and more about the strange island and her grandfather\u2019s past. Specifically, she learns that her grandfather was more than just a healer there. He\u2019s a Shaman, and he wants to teach her his skills, in particular the skill to create harmonious gardens, singing to them to make them grow faster.\n\nMutazione guides you through these mechanics slowly, meting out information about Kai and her family in casual dialogue and overheard conversations. The mystery is intriguing, and the island inhabitants are all engaging characters. I especially like Jell-A, the gelatinous mutant that lives in a cave. But I am 100 per cent here for growing the plants.\n\nAll the plants in Mutazione have a preferred place in the garden plot on top of your grandfather\u2019s house, and they also all have a preferred song and are associated with a type of instrument. My first garden was composed of plants that all sang the Pacific song, a sparse, warm melody no longer than something Link would play on his Ocarina.\n\nBy looking at the seeds I\u2019ve collected, I can tell there are plenty of songs I haven\u2019t heard yet. Some are Ethereal, some are Spooky, some sing a song of Wanderlust. But when you sing these songs to the plants, they harmonise, playing the tones of the instrument they\u2019re associated with. Sometimes I like to just listen to their tunes on the rooftop.\n\nI\u2019m interested in the mystery of Mutazione island and Kai\u2019s family. More than that, I\u2019m hoping that tending for plants can give Kai the peace I feel when I do it in real life. If only my own plants sang to me \u2014 I\u2019d never leave them alone.", "description": "Mutazione, an indie game from Die Gute Fabrik out Friday on Steam, Apple Arcade and PlayStation 4, does a lot of things well, but what really caught my attention was how it captured the magic of growing plants.
