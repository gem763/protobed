I can\u2019t even talk properly but it was a difficult pill to swallow. We have to support her now.\u201d\n\nBalance said they had forgiven Maditla: \u201cWherever she goes, there is still light at the end of the tunnel and we support her no matter what.\u201d\n\nMaditla has started serving her sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Maditla\u2019s Family To Still Support Her appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "Maditla\u2019s Family To Still Support Her", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/World_News_8_800x533_L_1420026210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
