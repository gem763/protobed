It wasn\u2019t that long ago that updates were rare things, but today almost every game will get updated at some point \u2014 some far more than others. While it may sound strange, there are times when I wish that biweekly updates just weren\u2019t a thing anymore. Sometimes I wish we could go back 15 or 20 years, when a released game was all we got, flaws and all. Even if that means unbalanced characters and buggy code.\n\nI was trying to get back into League of Legends when I started to think that multiplayer games, in particular, update way too much. It\u2019s gotten to the point that when you buy a new multiplayer title, you\u2019re not actually buying a finished game. You\u2019re buying a work-in-progress, that might play entirely differently a year from now.\n\nLeague is a great example of this. It\u2019s a game that I love \u2014 or at least, loved two years ago. Since I last played League regularly in 2017, it\u2019s gotten so many updates, reworks, and modifications that just jumping into a new match is a hurdle.\n\nChampions that I used to play regularly have been entirely revamped, meaning all my go-to strategies are useless. The map has been overhauled, meaning my jungling route is obsolete. And what happened to all the Runes that I spent actual money on? They\u2019re just gone?\n\nLeague isn\u2019t the only multiplayer game whose updates have transformed the game. In Overwatch, I still have trouble playing Hanzo after a 2018 update removed his Scatter Arrows and replaced them with a rapid-fire ability. And since her release, Symmetra\u2019s abilities have been overhauled multiple times, making her an entirely different character to play. The game I bought and learned how to play is no longer the one I own.\n\nScreenshot: Blizzard\n\nI feel guilty learning to play these games again after an absence, because I know I\u2019ll be dragging the rest of my team down as I relearn everything. And just reading about the changes online means nothing without seeing them in practice. And the longer I go without playing, the harder it is to get back into it. It feels like the only way to stay up to date is to play constantly \u2014 something which I can\u2019t always do.\n\nIt\u2019s true that PC games have had patches and updates for a long time. Games like NetHack have been receiving updates constantly since the late 80s. Some companies would even mail users floppy disks containing the latest bug fixes.\n\nBut for console games, things were usually set in stone. If a game was found to contain a major glitch, publishers had to take drastic measures to fix it, like Nintendo did with the infamous Berry Glitch in Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire. Things changed forever in 2003, when Epic released a patch for the Xbox version of Unreal Tournament, which could be downloaded through Xbox Live \u2014 the first such patch for a console game.\n\nThere was a worry at the time that being able to fix any game\u2019s bugs after the fact would let publishers ship unfinished games, maybe even ones rife with glitches, to be fixed later. Few people expected developers to instead start straight up rebuilding their games while people played them.\n\nYes, there will be bugs. Yes, things will be broken. But what\u2019s wrong with that?\n\nBug fixes are supposed to make games easier to play. But with games like League, Overwatch, and Fortnite constantly updating and changing, this means that just keeping track of how to play my favourite games is a challenge in and of itself.\n\nI know there\u2019s lots of value in updating games often. For the people who play every day, it keeps the games fresh and exciting. It can help developers crack down on catastrophic bugs and annoying cheaters. There\u2019s even a little offshoot economy propped up by their existence, the people on YouTube and Twitch who rack up millions of viewers by analysing each update down to the very last patch note. Updates have become so ubiquitous that even musicians are starting to embrace them.\n\nBut there are always going to be downsides. Whenever an update comes out for Apex or Overwatch, entire metas are destroyed in the blink of an eye, causing riots in the virtual streets for fans who liked the games they way they were. Often, bugs are created instead of fixed.\n\nOverwatch and League patch notes specifically call out metas, and justify updates by saying that they\u2019ll combat popular strategies. Why do developers have to destroy the strategies their players invent? It builds a cycle where players build metas, developers issue updates to change those metas, people complain that the metas don\u2019t work anymore, new metas are made, new updates break them, and on and on forever.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even mentioning the cost behind the scenes. When a game never stops being developed, developers never get a chance to rest. Employees at Epic, for example, are in a state of constant crunch, with some working 100-hour weeks just to keep pumping out updates. Fortnite will never be finished, will never stop changing, and will never stop requiring constant attention.\n\nFor all the value of updates, there is just as much value in a finished product that never updates. Yes, there will be bugs. Yes, things will be broken. But what\u2019s wrong with that? The parts that would be patched out nowadays are often the parts that make those games so amazing.\n\nTake Super Smash Bros. Melee for the GameCube. A large part of the reason it\u2019s become such a fan favourite, I would argue, is because Nintendo never got the chance to update it.\n\nThe competitive Melee community became famous for building glitches and exploits into their strategies. Wavedashing and L-Cancelling, once obscure bugs in the game\u2019s physics engine, have become staples of nearly every tournament match. I remember being seven years old, watching videos of how to pull these tricks off, set to Linkin Park\u2019s \u201cBreaking the Habit.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Nintendo\n\nThe characters are hopelessly unbalanced, but players made do. If you look at the history of Melee tier lists, you can see characters climb up and down. The meta evolved by itself, without any thumb on the scale from Nintendo. There were no patches or reworks, just fans coming up with new ways to play the same game. You can jump right back into Melee now, after years away, and you won\u2019t have to relearn anything.\n\nCompare this to Super Smash Bros. for Wii U or Ultimate, which \u2014 while definitely not the worst examples of update culture \u2014 have been subject to endless debates, memes, and complaints about which characters should be buffed or nerfed. Amazing glitches have been discovered, only to disappear with the next update. I love DLC characters as much as anyone, but I can\u2019t help but feel nostalgic for how finite past games were.\n\nMultiplayer games aren\u2019t the only ones that constant updates can hurt. Obviously, with single-player games, there\u2019s no longer the worry that I\u2019ll be letting down my team if I take the time to learn new strategies. But crunch still exists, and single-player patches are often aimed at the things that make some games so fun: bugs and exploits.\n\nJust look at speedrunning, where most of the top runners of single-player games rely on glitches and quirks to cut down their time. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time can now be beaten in under 17 minutes. Were it released today, I couldn\u2019t see Nintendo leaving all its wrong-warping and sequence-breaking glitches unpatched.\n\nI wish we could go back to a simpler time.\n\nWhen a game doesn\u2019t update, I only have to learn it once, not every other month. The game doesn\u2019t completely transform behind my back, leaving me in the dark.\n\nI know I\u2019m not the only one who feels like this. How many parents are there that can\u2019t dedicate so much time to their favourite games anymore? Or gamers without stable internet, who can only play occasionally? Some games now have entire builds dedicated specifically to people who can\u2019t play often.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think companies should just never update their games. Obviously, game-breaking glitches are bad, and getting new game modes and characters is always fun. But some games update so fast and so drastically that I can never settle down to enjoy it for all it is.\n\nMy favourite games won\u2019t stop updating, and they shouldn\u2019t. But maybe as games like Overwatch or League update, their developers can ease on the brakes a bit. Try to stick with what they\u2019ve already released, instead of replacing whole characters or mechanics. Developers don\u2019t need to release an update to match every small change in the meta \u2014 trust that players will enjoy the game enough to make do with what they have.\n\nI wonder if a multiplayer game like that could succeed anymore, or if we\u2019ve just gotten so used to the never-ending balance changes that such a game would be doomed from the start. There are so many games nowadays competing for our attention, after all, and updates keep our attention.\n\nBut sometimes, among all the arguments about what needs to be nerfed or buffed, added or removed, I wish we could go back to a simpler time \u2014 a time when we could just pick up our favourite games and play them, no homework required.\n\nWilliam Antonelli is a nonbinary writer from New York, and an Associate Editor at Business Insider.
