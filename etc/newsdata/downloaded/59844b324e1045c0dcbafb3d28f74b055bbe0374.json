Columbus defeated Toronto in overtime. Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe penalty shot was awarded after Toronto\u2019s Mitch Marner hooked Nyquist on a breakaway. Nyquist responded by scoring his second goal of the season.\n\nRiley Nash, Pierre-Luc Dubois and Alexander Wennberg also scored for Columbus. Nick Foligno had two assists. It was the seventh straight game decided by one goal for the Blue Jackets, who improved to 2-2 in overtime this season. They lost in overtime Friday and Saturday.\n\nAuston Matthews had a goal and an assist for the Maple Leafs while Kasperi Kapanen and William Nylander added a goal each. Jake Muzzin and Andreas Johnsson had two assists apiece.\n\nFlyers 6, Golden Knights 2\n\nMichael Raffl scored two goals and added one assist as host Philadelphia ended a four-game losing streak by trouncing Vegas.\n\nOskar Lindblom and Travis Konecny each scored one goal and added one assist, and Kevin Hayes and Matt Niskanen added a goal apiece for the Flyers, who scored the game\u2019s first five goals.\n\nFlyers goaltender Brian Elliott stopped 33 shots, while Golden Knights counterpart Oscar Danks struggled despite making 31 saves. Jonathan Marchessault and Reilly Smith scored the goals for Vegas, which had won four of five entering this game.\n\nBlues 3, Avalanche 1\n\nVladimir Tarasenko scored a goal and set up two others as host St. Louis handed Colorado its first regulation loss of the season.\n\nThe defeat could prove costly for the Avalanche. Top-line winger Mikko Rantanen exited the game with a left leg injury in the second period, and he needed help getting back to the Colorado dressing room.\n\nBrayden Schenn and David Perron also scored for the Blues, who snapped a four-game losing streak. Goaltender Jordan Binnington stopped 17 of 18 shots. Nathan MacKinnon scored for the Avalanche, extending his season-opening scoring streak to nine games (five goals, seven assists).\n\nStars 2, Senators 1\n\nJoe Pavelski scored a rare power-play goal, and backup goaltender Anton Khudobin was solid as Dallas earned its first home win of the season at Ottawa\u2019s expense.\n\nRadek Faksa also scored for the Stars, who outshot Ottawa 43-20 to improve to 3-7-1 and win back-to-back games for the first time this season. They were 0-2-1 at home before finally breaking though one night after several players, including stars Tyler Seguin and Ben Bishop, sustained damage to their homes from a tornado that swept through the north Dallas area.\n\nWith Bishop not in the lineup, Khudobin, who had yielded 10 goals while losing his first three starts of 2019-20, needed to make only 19 saves. He improved to 8-0-1 in his career against Ottawa.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Gustav Nyquist scored on a penalty shot at 1:57 of overtime, and the visiting Columbus Blue Jackets defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443595847&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L09J-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
