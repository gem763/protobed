Breja is suing Juul for retaliation for whistleblowing, wrongful termination, and other violations.\n\nOverall, Breja\u2019s complaint paints a dark picture of the company, which owns a lion\u2019s share of the e-cigarette market in the US. The former executive claims that Juul\u2019s senior management was motivated purely by profits and made many efforts to deceive regulators and customers, copying the despised tactics of Big Tobacco companies and trying to get customers addicted to their products.\n\nBreja accuses ex-CEO Kevin Burns of managing the company like a dictator, operating in a \u201cwin-at-all-costs, reckless fashion,\u201d and fostering a \u201cculture of silence.\u201d\n\nWhen Breja raised concerns about the company selling expired or soon-to-be expired products, Burns allegedly responded: \u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fo\u2019s, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.\u201d\n\nToxic claims\n\nPerhaps more concerning, Breja alleges that Juul sold a large amount of contaminated products out of greed. According to Breja, the company struggled to keep up with demand for mint-flavored products after Juul decided to pull other flavors from its retail stores late last year. The move was meant to dodge further public backlash for the rise in teen vaping, but it resulted in supply issues that threatened profits.\n\n\u201cYou need to have an IQ of 5 to know that when customers don\u2019t find mango they buy mint,\u201d Burns allegedly said while berating Juul\u2019s supply-chain team and its suppliers for the shortages.\n\nIn March of 2019, Breja learned that some batches of Mint eLiquid had been found to be contaminated. By that time, approximately 250,000 \u201cMint Refill Kits\u201d containing the contaminated liquids had already been shipped to retailers and were being sold to customers. The contaminated kits were equivalent to one million pods, the lawsuit notes.\n\nThe lawsuit does not indicate what the contaminate might be. But Breja\u2019s suit notes that the contamination issue arose \u201cin the wake of consumers recently having reported suffering seizures due to the use of Juul\u2019s products.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement to Ars, a Juul spokesperson responded:\n\nMr. Breja\u2019s claims are baseless. He was terminated in March 2019 because he failed to demonstrate the leadership qualities needed in his role. The allegations concerning safety issues with Juul products are equally meritless, and we already investigated the underlying manufacturing issue and determined the product met all applicable specifications. The company will vigorously defend this lawsuit.\n\nBreja\u2019s claims come at a critical time for Juul. The company is facing intense criticism for helping to light up an epidemic of youth vaping, particularly after revelations this summer that Juul directly pitched its products to teens while they were in school\n\nMoreover, the country is dealing with a rash of unexplained lung injuries that have been linked to vaping. Federal and state health investigators have not been able to determine what vaping products or contaminants could be causing the illnesses, but most cases have involved black-market products containing THC (the psychoactive component of cannabis)\u2014not nicotine products or Juul products, specifically.\n\nAs of October 22, 2019, there have been 1,604 reported cases of vaping-related injuries in 49 states, including 34 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nKevin Burns stepped down as Juul\u2019s CEO in September. He was replaced by K. C. Crosthwaite, the former chief growth officer at Altria Group Inc., formerly Philip Morris Companies, Inc., before the appointment. On Tuesday, the company confirmed plans to lay off 500 employees by the end of the year as part of a \u201cnecessary reset.\u201d", "description": "Whistleblower suit paints a dark picture of Juul's culture and management.", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1168822427-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
