I attended the 50th anniversary shareholder meeting in 2015 and have personally interviewed the Oracle of Omaha.\n\nWarren Buffett and Mark Skousen share ideas in New York in 2010.\n\nBuffett has become the third wealthiest person in the world as a result of the unbelievable success of his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, since its inception in 1965. He has clearly beaten the market for most of the time.\n\nOver the past 54 years, he has outdistanced the S&P 500 (including dividends) 37 times or 68% of the time. BKR-A\u2019s total return, from 1965 to 2018, is 2,472,627% compared to the SPY\u2019s 15,019%.\n\nDespite his 89 years of age, Buffett\u2019s skill has not diminished. In the past 14 years, Buffett\u2019s investment company has beaten the S&P 500 (including dividends) 10 times, versus only three times by the index. That\u2019s a 71% winning rate. See page 4 here.\n\nThe compounded rate of return is more than double the stock index: 20.5% a year for Berkshire vs. 9.7% for the S&P 500.\n\nBear in mind that Buffett has accomplished this remarkable feat by investing in hundreds of public and private companies.\n\nFor more than 54 years running, Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger have finetuned their competitive advantage of investing. At an early stage, Buffett adopted Munger\u2019s #1 lesson of investing: \u201cA great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price.\u201d (Quoted in \u201cThe Maxims of Wall Street,\u201d p. 36.)\n\nHas Buffett Lost His Magic Touch?\n\nBut this year may well be an exception \u2014 the S&P 500 is ahead 18%, while Berkshire Hathaway has struggled to make a profit.\n\nWhat happened? While Buffett has had some big winners, such as Apple, Coca Cola and American Express, his investment company has gone nowhere with bank stocks. Plus, it suffered a big loss investing in the Kraft Heinz Company (down almost 50% since February).\n\nBerkshire also took a hit when a major institutional pension sold most of its position in it a few months ago.\n\nBH also is sitting on a record $112 billion in cash, which has weighed down the stock price.\n\nFinally, Buffett has never been a fan of gold, so he has missed out on a major new bull market in mining stocks.\n\nBuffett Recommends Indexing!\n\nSince 2014, Buffett has been recommending that investors and even his own family members invest in a stock index fund and not count on his investment company to outperform in the future.\n\nThe reason? Berkshire is just too big. In his 2014 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett admits that \u201cBerkshire\u2019s long-term gains\u2026 cannot be dramatic and will not come close to those of the past 50 years. It is harder to double the market value of a $100 billion company than a $1 billion company.\u201d\n\nIs this the end of a remarkable success story?\n\nMaybe, but let us not count Warren Buffett out quite yet. There have been other times in the past when his investment company has done poorly compared to the stock market indexes. Such instances occurred in 1975, 1984, 1999 and 2009.\n\nI\u2019m still a shareholder.\n\nBy the way, normally I don\u2019t share personal investing stories in my column. But recently I \u201cfessed up\u201d to the biggest holding in my IRA in front of a small group in Washington, D.C. For the longest time, this investment was off-limits to regular investors, but that\u2019s all changed. In fact, it\u2019s helped me become a millionaire, and I believe it can do the same for my readers. Click here to watch my \u201cTED Talk\u201d presentation \u2014 and get the name of this investment.\n\nSpecial note : Warren Buffett is a big fan of my classic book, \u201cThe Maxims of Wall Street.\u201d He wrote me, \u201cI love your book and plan to steal some of its lines.\u201d\n\nIt is the one and only compendium of financial adages, ancient proverbs and worldly wisdom \u2014 it has sold over 25,000 copies. Alex Green calls it a \u201cclassic.\u201d\n\nCommodity guru Dennis Gartman says, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the depth of wisdom one can find in just one or two lines from your book.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMaxims\u201d book is available for only $20 for the first copy, and all additional copies are $10 each. And if you order an entire box of 32 books, you pay only $300. Plus, I pay postage and autograph each copy. It is the perfect gift for investors, clients, money managers and stockbrokers.\n\nTo order, call Harold at Ensign Publishing at 1-866-254-2057, or go to www.skousenbooks.com.\n\nC-SPAN Highlights FreedomFest Speakers and Authors\n\n\n\nThis week, C-SPAN Book TV continues to highlight sessions and interviews from this year\u2019s FreedomFest, including John Lott participating in the gun rights debate\u2026 and my session \u201cCall of the Wild West: Jack London, Rugged Individualist or Socialist?\u201d (4 p.m. EDT this Sunday). Or watch it here now.\n\nSpeaking Engagements in September\n\nI have several exciting speaking engagements this month.\n\nOn Constitution Day, Tuesday, Sept. 17, I will be returning to the Wisconsin Forum in Milwaukee to address the topic, \u201cHas the POTUS Become a PONTIFF? Power, Political Economy, and the Constitution.\u201d It includes dinner and the price is $68.50. For details, go to http://www.wisconsinforum.org/.\n\nTo purchase a ticket, contact Kristina Olkowski-Sayas at executivedirector@wisconsinforum.org.\n\nAfter my stop in Milwaukee, I\u2019ll be giving some lectures at Hillsdale College in Michigan, including one on Thursday, Sept. 19, on the topic \u201cHow Do You Get Rid of a Bad Idea (Democratic Socialism)? With a Better Idea \u2014 Democratic Capitalism!\u201d\n\nFinally, on Sept. 26-28, I\u2019ll be appearing in costume as Benjamin Franklin at the Philadelphia MoneyShow: Other speakers include Ken Fisher, Dennis Gartman, Tom Sosnoff and John Buckingham. You can obtain free admission to the MoneyShow as my guest by calling 1-800-970-4355 and by mentioning pass code: 048316\n\nGood investing, AEIOU,\n\nMark Skousen\n\nYou Blew It!\n\nBombarded by Seven Hours of Propaganda about Global Warming on CNN!\n\n\n\nBy Mark Skousen\n\nEditor, Forecasts & Strategies\n\nThe media is determined to make global warming a hot campaign issue.\n\nLast night, I watched part of the seven-hour program on CNN \u2014 yes, SEVEN hours \u2014 on the Democrats\u2019 response to the global warming hysteria.\n\nIt was long enough to see socialist Senator Bernie Sanders advocate spending $16 trillion (trillion!) of taxpayers\u2019 money on solving climate change.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris wants to ban all fossil fuel use in 11 years, which will destroy millions of jobs and raise the cost of living dramatically (alternative energy is still very expensive compared to oil & gas).\n\nOne Democratic Party candidate claimed that hurricanes now are more frequent and intense, both of which are factually incorrect.\n\nFortunately, Fox News tried to give a more balanced and fair approach. Heartland Institute geologist Gregory Wrightstone, author of \u201cInconvenient Facts: The Science That Al Gore Doesn\u2019t Want You to Know\u201d (click here to his book on Amazon), was a guest who gave a less hysterical viewpoint that climate change isn\u2019t the end of the world, not now, or in 11 years as activist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also known as AOC, and other alarmist Democrats expect.\n\nWe plan a hot debate on \u201cGlobal Warming: How Bad Is It?\u201d at FreedomFest 2020. Can\u2019t wait to find out the facts, the truth and the best policies to deal with this issue.\n\nThe post Has Warren Buffett Lost His Magic Touch? appeared first on Stock Investor.", "description": "\u201cSomeone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted .09/06/2019 8:08:41AM EST.", "authors": ["Mark Skousen", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
