Either way, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s timing seems calculated for turning out right-leaning voters in the upcoming Israeli elections. The PM pledged to impose \u201csovereignty\u201d over the entire Jordan Valley in his next term, assuming he gets one:\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel in a dramatic announcement on Tuesday that he has a commitment from the United States that, \u201cif you elect me,\u201d he will be able to instigate Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. Netanyahu had announced earlier in the day that he will make a \u201cdramatic announcement\u201d at 5 PM. It was later postponed until sometime after 6 PM. In the meantime, the White House announced that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will brief the press \u2013 alongside National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2013 at 1:30 PM (EST).\n\nNetanyahu had earlier pledged to annex the West Bank settlements in an effort to expand his appeal among conservative Israelis. This goes farther in both claimed land and strategic positioning, essentially making everything except the Palestinian cities within the West Bank part of Israel. Netanyahu stressed the need for a defensive \u201cbelt\u201d and pledged never to return to the 1948 border lines:\n\n\u201cWe are on the eve of the elections. President Trump said he will present his Deal of the Century few days after the election and it is just around the corner. This presents us with a great challenge and a great opportunity to apply Israeli sovereignty to Judea and Samaria and other areas,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u2026 \u201cThere is one place that Israeli sovereignty can be applied immediately after the elections if Israeli citizens let me in. Today I announce my intention to apply Israeli sovereignty to the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea,\u201d he declared. \u201cThis will be our defensive belt to the east. It ensures that we will never be a country a few miles wide,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nIn making the announcement, Netanyahu claimed that the US would help coordinate the application of sovereignty, although he added an odd caveat:\n\n\u201cI request a mandate to apply Jewish sovereignty to all communities and I intend to do so in coordination with the United States,\u201d he said, adding that the U.S. would present its long-awaited Israel-Palestinian peace plan a few days after the election. \u201cIf I choose, I will contain Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea. This will be the first step if I choose,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf I choose\u201d seems like a strange addition to a promise, and it suggests that this may be a bit more than an electoral tactic. It might be part of a PR strategy for the US as the Trump administration seeks to get Palestinian buy-in on its version of a peace plan. Netanyahu might be playing \u2018bad cop\u2019 with this \u201cdramatic announcement\u201d of annexing the Jordan Valley as a means to get the Palestinians looking toward Washington to head off such a change.\n\nThus far, the Palestinians are reacting exactly how one would expect, demanding international sanctions on Israel for their \u201ccrimes.\u201d The Palestinian Authority had hoped to head off such a move by incentivizing the colonization of the Jordan Valley, the Palestinian PM announced three weeks ago. That prompted the Israelis on the Jordan Valley Regional Council to demand action from the Netanyahu government to stave off a major demographic shift ahead of any peace plan that might get adopted for the West Bank:\n\nJordan Valley Regional Council head David Lahiani and the right-wing NGO Regavim have long held that they were fighting to maintain Israel\u2019s hold on Area C, including the Jordan Valley. The Palestinians are now embarking on a campaign with regard to the Jordan Valley, because they fear that US President Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan, known as the \u201cDeal of the Century,\u201d will include placing the Jordan Valley within Israel\u2019s sovereign borders. \u201cThe Palestinians are very scared of the Deal of the Century,\u201d Lahiani told The Jerusalem Post. \u2026 The PA holds that the Jordan Valley and all of Area C, which is now under Israeli military and civilian control, must be part of their future state.\n\nThat\u2019s the acute context for Netanyahu\u2019s announcement, but the \u201cif I choose\u201d qualifier might mean something else, too. It\u2019s not uncommon for Israeli politicians to make statements of purpose regarding the West Bank during elections, only to deal more in reality afterward. That was seen in Netanyahu\u2019s earlier promise to integrate the Israeli settlements into the state of Israel rather than leaving them operating under military control, but Netanyahu made a similar promise in April in the previous elections. It didn\u2019t help then:\n\nFor most of his time as Israel\u2019s leader, Netanyahu has refrained from making outright statements about annexation of the West Bank, despite pressure from those who live in the settlements, a comparatively small but politically powerful sector of society. Similar comments during the previous round of elections in April were seen by many as another empty campaign promise. The April election ended in a stalemate three months ago when Netanyahu, whose ruling Likud party won the largest share of the votes, failed to pull together a stable coalition.\n\nThat might be the same this time around, especially since Netanyahu could have taken this step earlier even without an operating Knesset majority:\n\nEugene Kontorovich, director of international law at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum, said \u201cit was far from clear if such a promise will materialize.\u201d \u201cIf the prime minister wanted to, he could take this action right now with a mere cabinet decision. It does not require Knesset legislation,\u201d Kontorovich said. \u201cSo it is unclear what the value of a mere speech is.\u201d\n\nAll eyes will now turn to the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century,\u201d as well as the elections next week. Whether Netanyahu is serious about this may well depend on how many seats he needs to form a majority coalition \u2014 and whether John Bolton\u2019s exit impacts the proposal coming from the White House. Bolton was an advocate for Israel retaining the Jordan Valley, and it remains to be seen whether others within the administration see that as essential as Bolton did.", "description": "\"In coordination with the US\"?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/netanyahu-annex.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
