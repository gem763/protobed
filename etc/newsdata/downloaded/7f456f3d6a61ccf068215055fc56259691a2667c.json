Trump\u2019s approval rating among Hispanic adults nationally stood at 25 percent in a Washington Post-ABC News poll this month, with 67 percent disapproving. That is 13 points lower than Trump\u2019s overall job approval rating of 38 percent.", "description": "", "authors": ["Beta.Washingtonpost.Com Politics In-New-Mexico-Rally-Trump-Makes-A-Direct-Appeal-To-Hispanic-Voters"], "top_image": ""}
