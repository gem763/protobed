And somebody has to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nMr. Barr also has been forthright for months about his desire to probe how and why the FBI during the Obama administration obtained permission from a secret court to monitor Trump campaign officials in 2016.\n\n\u201cI think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,\u201d Mr. Barr told Congress during a public hearing in April. \u201cI am not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it\u2019s important to look at them.\u201d\n\nAlthough Democrats and much of the media are criticizing Mr. Barr\u2019s involvement, many legal specialists say there\u2019s nothing inappropriate about the president dispatching the attorney general to find out what led to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, which found no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign to interfere in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything remotely criminal here,\u201d former Justice Department prosecutor Jim Trusty said on Fox News. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about something that you could turn into a federal offense. There\u2019s no real violation. I wish the president wouldn\u2019t specifically mention [Democratic front-runner Joseph] Biden \u2026 but sometimes he pushes that a little bit far.\u201d\n\nIn a July 25 phone call at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation of Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who had been paid $3 million by an Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president.\n\nMr. Trump also asked Ukraine\u2019s leader to work with Mr. Barr on the origins of the Russia probe, some of which centered on the FBI\u2019s digging into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s work in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s legitimate for them to look at the FISA [foreign intelligence surveillance act] process,\u201d said a veteran Washington defense lawyer with experience in such matters. \u201cBarr announced when he came in that he was going to look into the use of FISA warrants, and whether they were appropriately initiated and conducted. In some sense, this is part of that.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former Justice Department officials have said there\u2019s nothing illegal or unethical about Mr. Trump asking world leaders to cooperate with the attorney general and that Mr. Barr has the authority to speak with foreign law-enforcement officials about U.S. investigations.\n\nRon Aledo, a former CIA analyst and Homeland Security employee who has worked in several U.S. embassies, said Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call on July 25 with Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201cis exactly what any given Department of Justice attache does any given day in all U.S. embassies around the world: request the host country for information and updates on ongoing investigations.\n\n\u201cIf Trump did something illegal, then all the DOJ attaches worldwide do something illegal every single day,\u201d Mr. Aledo said. \u201cThey request criminal intelligence exchanges. If you have any evidence you want to share with me, we have a reason we want to share with you.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump sought help in the probe of the FBI investigation from Australia, but his phone call to that country\u2019s prime minister actually was preceded by an Australian offer of help on May 28. Its ambassador to the U.S., Joe Hockey, wrote to Mr. Barr to offer Australia\u2019s assistance.\n\n\u201cThe Australian government will use its best endeavors to support your efforts in this matter,\u201d Mr. Hockey wrote, referring to the president\u2019s announcement four days earlier to investigate the origins of the FBI investigation.\n\nStill, some say the involvement by Mr. Barr is casting him in a partisan light.\n\n\u201cTrump didn\u2019t designate Barr to play some neutral, objective role,\u201d said Charles Tiefer, a law professor who specializes in the legislative branch at the University of Baltimore. \u201cTrump designated Barr to bring back \u2018the goods\u2019 on the Democrats \u2014 inculpatory evidence about the Democrats.\u201d\n\nRep. Don Beyer, Virginia Democrat, said on Twitter that Mr. Barr \u201cis billing US taxpayers to fly all over the world asking foreign countries to intervene in our domestic politics by attacking US intelligence findings in order to massage the President\u2019s fragile ego.\u201d\n\nPeople for the American Way President Michael Keegan said Mr. Barr\u2019s task \u201cunfortunately looks for all the world like an attempt to discredit our intelligence community\u2019s findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttorney General Barr continues to approach his office as if he were the president\u2019s lawyer rather than the lawyer for the American people, which the attorney general should be,\u201d Mr. Keegan said. \u201cThe latest developments are just one more indicator that his Justice Department has been completely co-opted to serve Donald Trump\u2019s political agenda.\u201d\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican and a Trump ally, disagrees with that view.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to me that liberals are starting an attack against Barr to shut him down from going to Italy, Australia and the U.K. to find out if there was something wrong regarding opening up the investigation of the Trump campaign to begin with,\u201d Mr. Graham told Fox News. \u201cIf that\u2019s not a double standard, I don\u2019t know what would be.\u201d\n\nHe said the foreign governments \u201cshould be cooperating with Barr.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Barr looking into this,\u201d he said. \u201cAs matter of fact, it would be wrong if he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
