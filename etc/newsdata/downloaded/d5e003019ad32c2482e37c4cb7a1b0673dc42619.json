(Pool/Reuters)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe right-wing populist canard rests on a premise that works only if the populists never get elected. You know how it goes: Politics is corrupt, the populist \u201calone\u201d can fix it and those who oppose him are enemies of the state who thwart his ability to fix things. The kicker of course is that right-wing populists, being snake oil salesmen and anti-government nihilists, don\u2019t know how to fix much of anything, and after all the huffing and puffing, the public gets the idea the populist cult leader is an incompetent charlatan. And here I\u2019m not talking about President Trump, or rather only about Trump.\n\nThe Post reports that Prime Minister Boris Johnson, under public assault for his scheme to suspend Parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit, has now lost his majority:\n\nIn Parliament, Johnson was heckled and catcalled from almost the moment he stood to speak. He noted that Tuesday was the 80th anniversary of Britain\u2019s entrance into World War II and said \u201cThis country still stands then as now for democracy for the rule of law.\u201d He was met with jeering laughter. He insisted that Britain was making progress in talks with European Union leaders about an orderly Brexit, which drew more mocking laughter. Aided by repeated demands for \u201cOrder\u201d by House Speaker John Bercow, Johnson said his opponents\u2019 proposal to delay Brexit by another three months after Oct. 31 would \u201cForce us to beg for yet another pointless delay.\u201d\n\nAs Johnson was speaking, Conservative member of Parliament Phillip Lee dramatically crossed the isle to join the opposition, depriving Johnson of his majority.\n\nIt is widely suspected that Johnson has no real plan to avoid Brexit, thinks crashing out of the European Union won\u2019t be so bad and, in any case, there will be others to blame. He\u2019s tried the anti-democratic approach and gotten whacked on the snout.\n\nAfter a great deal of thought, I have reached the conclusion that it is no longer possible to serve my constituents\u2019 and country\u2019s best interests as a Conservative Member of Parliament. My letter to the Prime Minister: pic.twitter.com/0QreSbSdwR \u2014 Dr Phillip Lee MP (@DrPhillipLeeMP) September 3, 2019\n\nIn words that could apply to America\u2019s Republican Party, Lee explains, \u201cThe Conservative Party that attracted me to join it as a young man was a broad political church,\u201d (what we\u2019d call a \u201cbig tent\u201d) and his attachment to the party was based on \u201csound conservative principles of careful governance, responsible reform, respect for the rule of law, protecting our home union and sound stewardship of the economy.\u201d With Brexit looming before him, Lee says the party is now characterized by a single, thin reed, \u201chow recklessly one wishes to leave the European Union.\u201d He castigates a party that \u201chas increasingly become infected with the twin diseases of populism and English nationalism.\u201d\n\nThe lessons here for the United States are not hard to discern.\n\nFirst, Trump, like Johnson, is all bluster and no competence, and as problems of his own making mount, he becomes even less stable. As matters get worse, Trump hides more often (e.g., refusing to go to Poland), lies more (e.g., phantom calls from China\u2019s negotiators, an anti-historical explanation for Russia\u2019s expulsion from the Group of Seven) and lashes out more frequently.\n\nSecond, unlike Lee, the United States has, with the exception of Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), no sitting legislator with the nerve to call out his party\u2019s leader and stand up for conservative and constitutional principles. If we had a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote in the United States \u2014 wouldn\u2019t that be delightful?! \u2014 the Republican administration and party would collapse under the weight of Trump\u2019s stunning incompetence. The very little man behind the curtain no longer can sustain the illusion of sanity, let alone strength.\n\nAnd finally, the antidote to illiberal wannabe autocrats is democracy. Brits took to the streets to protest Johnson\u2019s scheme, and now in the heart of the oldest deliberative body, the model for democratic legislatures everywhere, conservatives are taking on their leader. If American conservatives would only follow their example, America\u2019s Trumpian nightmare would end sooner rather than later.\n\nRead more:\n\nHenry Olsen: Britain is on the verge of a constitutional crisis\n\nAnne Applebaum: Boris Johnson\u2019s constitutional crisis now resembles America\u2019s\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Boris Johnson\u2019s reckless path is bad for Britain\n\nHenry Olsen: Boris Johnson has thrown down the gauntlet on Brexit \u2014 and he\u2019s positioned to win\n\nRyan Bourne: Don\u2019t lump Boris Johnson together with Donald Trump\n\nJustin Amash: Our politics is in a partisan death spiral.
