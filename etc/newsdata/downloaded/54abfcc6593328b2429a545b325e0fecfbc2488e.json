The trainers feature the logo of homeless charity Nightsafe.\n\nThe proceeds from the initial launch day went towards helping young and vulnerable youngsters, with the original trainers selling for \u00a3100 a pop.\n\nThe inflated prices could be due to \u2018shill bidding\u2019 (Picture: Ebay)\n\nBut within minutes of the launch, the shoes started popping up on eBay for eye-watering amounts. Another pair was spotted with a cost of \u00a358,700, and a third was selling for \u00a336,700.\n\nBut the sky-high costs might not actually be reflective of what the general public is willing to pay for the shoes.\n\nIt might actually be down to \u2018shill bidding\u2019, which eBay describes like this: \u2018Shill bidding is when someone bids on an item to artificially increase its price, desirability, or search standing\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt basically creates an unfair advantage, or it can cause another bidder to pay more than they should.\n\neBay claims to have a number of systems in place to detect and monitor bidding patterns and practices, and if the site spots any malicious behaviour it will take steps to prevent it.\n\nThe bidding site now appears to have removed some of the listings. So if you\u2019re desperate to get your hands on these kicks, you might have to go further afield.\n\nMORE: What is the Halloween witch sex position and how does it work?\n\nMORE: This man is running 12km every day to represent the number of men dying from suicide each week\n\nMORE: Woman quits job as funeral director to become a professional mermaid earning \u00a3100 an hour\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Adidas trainers launched to raise money for a homeless charity have been spotted on eBay selling for thousands of pounds.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88174649_1570521088.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
