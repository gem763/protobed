But Russia has done its utmost to be one step ahead of its near-peer rivals, Putin assured his interviewer.\n\nWhat we did was enhance and improve [Russian] ballistic missiles significantly, and developed a new weapon that has no rivals in the world.\n\nPutin has already unveiled an array of futuristic weapons systems last year. Among the novelties were two hypersonic projectiles that caught the global audience\u2019s eyes. One was the Avangard (Vanguard), a highly-maneuverable glider fitted to a silo-launched ballistic missile.\n\nAnother enigmatic weapon was the Burevestnik (Thunderbird), which, according to Putin, has \u201cunlimited range and unlimited ability to maneuver.\u201d It is currently undergoing additional ground tests and is expected to then begin flight tests.\n\nAlso on rt.com Test launch of new Russian anti-ballistic missile caught on VIDEO\n\nLike this story?
