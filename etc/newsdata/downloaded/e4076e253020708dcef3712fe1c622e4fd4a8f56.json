Hughes said the Catholic church should firmly place itself alongside the region\u2019s indigenous people and defending their territorial rights and way of life.\n\n\u201cThe life of the [Amazon] people is intrinsically, inherently part of the territory. If the territory is injured, the people are injured,\u201d he said.\n\nStretching from the Andes in the west to Brazil\u2019s Atlantic coast, the Amazon basin ecosystem faces a host of threats.\n\n'Chaos, chaos, chaos': a journey through Bolsonaro's Amazon inferno Read more\n\nFires \u2013 many ignited deliberately \u2013 have surged across the region this year. In Brazil, whose territory includes the largest portion of the Amazon, blazes increased by 84% in August compared to the same period last year, and deforestation spiked in July to a level not seen in more than a decade.\n\nRains in September have helped efforts to control the fires, but the aggressively anti-environmental rhetoric of Jair Bolsonaro continues to emboldenland grabbers, loggers and miners to invade indigenous or protected land. Brazil\u2019s far-right president has repeatedly promised to open up indigenous territories for mining and development.\n\nThe situation is equally dire in neighbouring Bolivia, where up to 4m hectares in the Chiquitano dry forest, Amazon and the Gran Chaco ecosystems have gone up in flames in the past two months. Environmentalists blame the leftwing president Evo Morales for legalising slash-and-burn fires to open up pastureland for cattle farming and beef exports to China.\n\n\u201cThe Amazon is witness to death and resurrection right now,\u201d said Hughes in the Peruvian capital Lima, where he has lived and worked for nearly 50 years.\n\n\u201cIt is a place of beauty, a place of immense marvel, providence, abundance of life on every level. But it\u2019s also a place of death, destruction, violence, ransacking, plunder and tremendous chaos.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A fire burns out of control after spreading onto a farm along a highway in Nova Santa Helena municipality in northern Mato Grosso State, south in the Amazon basin in Brazil.

But Catholic priests have often side with indigenous people against invaders.\n\nBoth sides of that history are palpable in Puerto Maldonado, which grew from a frontier rubber settlement during the 1902 rubber boom into a sprawling city powered by a modern-day gold rush.\n\nLooming large over the city is the most ruthless of all the rubber barons: Carlos Ferm\u00edn Fitzcarrald \u2013 the inspiration for Werner Herzog\u2019s 1982 film Fitzcarraldo.\n\nHis name adorns the town\u2019s main avenue, schools and monuments; his memory is still vivid in a region where entire ethnic groups were decimated during the rubber boom.\n\nHarakmbut elders still tell how Fitzcarrald tricked thousands of tribespeople to meet on a river islet, where they were massacred.\n\nBodies clogged the river, and sickened entire villages downstream. Survivors fled into the forest, emerging only after generations of their peers had died from violence and disease.\n\n\u201cFitzcarrald is no longer here but his spirit is in every oil company; it\u2019s in the logging and the illegal mining which destroys our forests,\u201d said Patiachi.\n\nSalvation came in the figure of a Dominican missionary, Father Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez, who arrived in Madre de Dios in 1917, two decades after Fitzcarrald died. The Spanish priest helped protect the Harakmbut from rubber tappers, and came to be known as Apaktone, or \u2018old father\u2019 .\n\n\u201cWe recognise Apaktone as the one who came to prevent the total extinction of the Harakmbut,\u201d said Patiachi.\n\n\u00c1lvarez\u2019s pastoral work in the 150,000 sq km Apostolic Diocese of Madre de Dios left its mark on Dominican followers including Peruvian priest Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, one of the founders of Liberation Theology, a distinctly Latin American movement, which teaches that Catholics must revive the biblical commitment to the poor.\n\nPuerto Maldonado was also the setting for Pope Francis\u2019s 2018 encounter with indigenous leaders, where the first Latin American pontiff warned that the Amazon was facing an unprecedented threat.\n\nYet the church is rapidly losing followers as evangelical Protestant groups expand across the region. Fifty years ago nearly everybody in Latin America lived and died a Catholic; by 2014 69% of Latin Americans belonged to the church.\n\nOne of the proposals the synod will consider is a change to the Catholic church\u2019s centuries-old requirement that priests must be celibate in order to allow the ordination of married men in remote areas of the Amazon.\n\nBut organizers insist that the church is not simply fighting for its share in the market of souls. Cardinal Claudio Hummes, the president of the synod, said this week that the Amazon was facing a crisis in which ecological problems were inseparable from social issues.\n\nTo find a solution, the world must hear \u201cboth the cry of the earth and that of the poor\u201d he said.\n\nXavier Arbex, a Swiss priest who has spent close to 40 years in Madre de Dios, said what the pope is proposing is \u201csocially and politically revolutionary\u201d.\n\nBut half a lifetime defending human rights in the Amazon makes the 77-year-old cleric pessimistic the synod can impede the \u201csavage capitalism\u201d driving the destruction.\n\n\u201cThe synod will shine a light but it won\u2019t be enough to drive away the darkness,\u201d he said.\n\nSixty miles west of Puerto Maldonado, storefront evangelical churches sit amid wooden shacks and bars in La Pampa, a frontier boomtown which sprang up around a recent gold rush.\n\nSince a government crackdown earlier this year, illegal miners have pushed deeper into the jungle, and the local economy is grinding to a halt.\n\nSitting outside his roadside motorcycle repair shop, Samuel Tecse Barrios put it simply: \u201cThere\u2019s no work.\u201d\n\nTecse Barrios belongs to the Israelite Mission of the New Universal Pact, a Peruvian doomsday sect that is just one of the Catholic church\u2019s competitors in the Amazon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Samuel Tecse Barrios, 57, belongs to a Peruvian sect known as the Israelites of the New Universal Pact who believe Peru is the promised land.

With their colourful, flowing robes they look like overgrown cast members of a nativity play.\n\nIt is 36C in the shade, but Tecse Barrios, 57, does not accept that rising temperatures are driven partly by Amazon deforestation.\n\n\u201cIt is God\u2019s punishment. He told us we would destroy ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve sinned worse than in Sodom and Gomorrah. What comes next will be seven years of drought, famine, torrential rains and floods, as it says in the Old Testament.\u201d\n\nBack in Puerto Maldonado, Zully Rojas, 53, tends a grotto to the Virgin Mary in the airy home shared by the Missionary Dominican Sisters of the Rosary. It is dotted with Amazon plants and baskets of Brazil nuts on a typical Ken\u00e9 patterned blanket.\n\n\u201cSome thing we will never agree on,\u201d says Rojas of dialogue with other churches. \u201cBut caring for the forest is synonymous with life, on this we have to come to an agreement.\u201d\n\nBeneath the shrine there is a verse from Exodus 3:5: \u201cTake your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Angela Giuffrida in Rome", "description": "Indigenous tribes see the Catholic church as a key ally in the ecological fight \u2013 and an unprecedented synod is focused on how to stop the destruction", "authors": ["Dan Collyns"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b77537123150f114ac0633be0171d5b94992e00/0_361_5464_3279/master/5464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=776463a564f872e2fa3f10716e3671a2", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
