Our private discussion, in his office with the door closed, began with Andrew\u2019s remarks that because I was married, I wouldn\u2019t want to continue working as hard as I had been. That as a wife, I\u2019d be focused on my new life.\u201d\n\nResponding to Watkins\u2019 allegation on Thursday, Yang told HuffPost: \u201cAs a CEO I made decisions about hiring and firing singularly based on performance. Kimberly Watkins\u2019 facts about her break from Manhattan Prep are inaccurate. During my more than a decade as CEO, I have worked with many women, married and otherwise, and value their work and dedication as important to the success of any institution. If I were the kind of leader who would do the sort of thing described by Ms. Watkins I would never enjoy a whiff of success. Women leaders are vital to any company or organization and I have been very fortunate and grateful to have worked with many of them in my career.\u201c\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang speaks on the second night of the second 2020 Democratic U.S. presidential debate in Detroit on July 31, 2019.

The co-chair of the Commission on Gender Equity is Chirlane McCray, the wife of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is also running for president.\n\nWatkins told the audience: \u201cAndrew Yang didn\u2019t harass me\u2026 He treated me unjustly and he violated me economically.\u201d\n\nAccording to Watkins, Yang had promoted her to senior director shortly after he started at Manhattan Prep and she had \u201chit all of [her] growth targets.\u201d As an at-will employee, she could be terminated at any time, and Watkins says that she received a monthly payment for two years after she was fired. Manhattan Prep was acquired by test-prep giant Kaplan in 2009, and Yang walked away with what he described as \u201csome number in the millions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe conjured a lie when I left to save me from the embarrassment,\u201d Watkins said Thursday. \u201cAs you can imagine, recent events have reopened wounds that I have never quite recovered from.\u201d\n\n\u201cKaplan acquired Manhattan Prep in December 2009 and has no comment,\u201d a spokesman for Kaplan told HuffPost. HuffPost has not independently verified Watkin\u2019s account at this time.\n\n\u201cSince the termination was couched for me, as a \u2018freedom to move on\u2019 narrative, the deal Andrew Yang offered me was commensurate with what he believed I deserved, a monthly payment for no longer working,\u201d Watkins wrote in Gotham Gazette. \u201cSounds a lot like Yang\u2019s \u2018freedom dividend\u2019 platform doesn\u2019t it?... Rather than governing our way into a sustainable economy, Yang\u2019s plan absolves the government from overseeing companies that could render countless workers obsolete.\u201d\n\nWhen HuffPost asked if she had a response to Yang\u2019s comment on her claims, Watkins called his statement \u201cjust patently false. And I think it underscores the burden that is placed on a woman behind closed doors to prove what happened.\u201d", "description": "The 2020 presidential candidate allegedly told Kimberly Watkins she \"wouldn't want to continue working as hard.\"", "authors": ["Emma Gray"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xOnlm9v9VW19H8QG42dcmw--~B/aD0xMzI2O3c9MTk5NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d83d137230000100558308d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
