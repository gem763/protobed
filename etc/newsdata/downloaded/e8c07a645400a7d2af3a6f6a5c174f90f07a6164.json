California\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s sick.\n\n\u201cHe could have promoted it from a point of view that\u2019s non-boxing, but getting their licenses, no head guards, rounds of boxing.\n\n\u201cWhat people have to realise is, you have to put all eyes on boxing for us all to thrive.\n\n\u201cSo KSI and Logan Paul have a bigger following than me and most of the heavyweights combined.\u201d\n\nThe Independent recently learned that both Devin Haney and Billy Joe Saunders are to feature on the undercard \u2013 and Joshua believes that the matchup between the two YouTube stars will attract plenty of eyes to the sport.\n\n\u201cIf all those eyes are now going to watch me and watch my competitors and watch the sport of boxing, it\u2019s going to rise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always say I\u2019m for it, so good luck to both of them, I hope they take it seriously because they can earn some respect here.\n\n\u201cPeople look at them as a joke now, and they doubt them, but if they take it serious and they put on a good performance people might scratch their head and say, \u2018Hang on a minute, this weren\u2019t such a bad idea\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou never know, YouTubers or this sort of event might happen more often.\u201d\n\nKSI vs Logan Paul is on 9 November at Staples Centre in Los Angeles, California.", "description": "Heavyweight contender Anthony Joshua believes that the fight
