The cloud strategy includes partnering with some of the world\u2019s largest software companies including SAP and Oracle.\n\nAt the core of Microsoft\u2019s resurgence is the bundling of an increasing number of products including software for security, compliance, workflow management and collaboration.\n\nNadella says Microsoft is riding a wave of demand caused by the rise of distributed computing. He says computing will migrate to where data is being generated and the company\u2019s cloud services are designed to meet this growing demand. Artificial intelligence is only just starting to gain traction among customers.\n\nWhen Hood was asked about the macroeconomic environment and how it was shaping the Microsoft strategy, she said there were plenty of opportunities for the company to grow in areas with large, expanding and durable total addressable markets.\n\nInvestors buying Microsoft shares are paying about seven times forecast full-year revenue and 27 times forecast full-year earnings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you compare that to WiseTech it is clear investors are willing to pay much more for revenue and earnings. The comparative numbers are 18 times forecast revenue and about 160 times forecast earnings.\n\nThe other measure that puts WiseTech in front of Microsoft is revenue growth. Over the past three years WiseTech has recorded revenue growth in excess of 77 per cent in Europe and more than 32 per cent in the Asia Pacific region, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue growth over the past three years has been about 11.4 per cent in the United States and 11.3 per cent in its international operations.\n\nBut when you dig a bit deeper and compare other valuation and performance ratios, Microsoft jumps ahead of WiseTech.\n\nMicrosoft has much higher gross profit margins and much higher margins on earnings before interest and tax.\n\nLack of alternatives\n\nMicrosoft is earning 42 per cent on its equity while WiseTech earns about 10 per cent. This difference is partly explained by Microsoft\u2019s consistent purchase of its own shares. Microsoft returned $US7.9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, an increase of 28 per cent compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.\n\nIt is clear from the comparison of key statistics for Microsoft and WiseTech that investors in the Australian company are willing to pay a very high price for strong revenue growth. This may be because of the lack of alternative high-growth companies listed on the S &P ASX200.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestors in WiseTech have been willing to pay an earnings multiple that is high by local standards and extremely high by world standards.\n\nLocal investors have put WiseTech on a valuation pedestal much higher than any of its comparable local software companies and much higher than Microsoft.\n\nThe confidence in the future of WiseTech has come into question this past week but it remains one of the most expensive software companies in the world.\n\nDisclosure: The author\u2019s self-managed super fund owns shares in Microsoft.", "description": "This comparison between Microsoft and WiseTech provides some insights into what to look for when investing in technology companies.
