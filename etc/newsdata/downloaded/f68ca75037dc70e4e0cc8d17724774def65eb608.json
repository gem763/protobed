With the top two qualifying from each group, there\u2019s a chance Russia, which is eight points clear in second place, could also advance by beating Scotland on the same night.\n\nItaly holds a six-point lead in Group J after winning all six of its matches, and is guaranteed to qualify with victories over Greece and Liechtenstein over the next week.\n\nSpain enjoys the biggest lead in European qualifying - by seven points in Group F after also winning six straight games - and might just need one victory in its matches at Norway and Sweden to advance.\n\nGroup A leader England will qualify with a win at the Czech Republic on Friday.\n\nTwo teams who are still in a fight to qualify are Portugal and France - the finalists in Euro 2016.\n\nFrance, the world champion, is second in Group H on goal difference behind Turkey but would be joined on points by third-place Iceland with a loss in Reykjavik on Friday. France then hosts Turkey on Monday.\n\nPortugal, the defending European champion, is in second place in Group B and five points behind Ukraine, which it visits on Monday. A loss for Portugal in Kiev would leave third-place Serbia in with a chance of reeling in the titleholder.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some talking points ahead of the upcoming two rounds of qualifiers:\n\nNO LLORIS\n\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps will have to change his goalkeeper after Hugo Lloris was ruled out until next year because of a broken left elbow. Steve Mandanda looks to be an able deputy.\n\nThe 34-year-old Mandanda was recalled to the squad after some excellent performances for Marseille since the start of this season. Having recovered from a torn muscle, he has produced several decisive and spectacular saves to compensate for his team\u2019s defensive shortcomings.\n\nMandanda was initially recalled to be No. 2 behind Lloris but is now in line to win his 29th cap - and first since last year\u2019s World Cup, when he kept a clean sheet against Denmark.\n\nIf Deschamps prefers youth to experience, Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Alphonse Areola and Lille\u2019s Mike Maignan are the other two goalkeepers in the squad.\n\nENGLAND\u2019S MIDFIELD\n\nThere is much to like about the new-look England under Gareth Southgate, particularly the potency of a frontline containing three of Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford, and also the raft of dynamic full-back options available.\n\nOne area where Southgate has yet to strike the right balance is in midfield - the department where England was exposed in the loss to Croatia in the World Cup semifinals last year.\n\nThe current first-choice midfield appears to be Declan Rice, Jordan Henderson and Ross Barkley, but the emergence of playmakers Mason Mount and James Maddison - of Chelsea and Leicester, respectively - leaves Barkley, in particular, vulnerable for his place.\n\nGERMANY SLUMPING\n\nBefore Germany resumes its Euro 2020 qualifiers at Estonia on Sunday, there is a friendly against Argentina in Dortmund on Wednesday.\n\nThe 2014 World Cup final rematch is now a meeting of the No. 10 and No. 16 ranked teams - and it\u2019s four-time world champion Germany which is lower and falling.\n\nNow ranked outside the top 10 teams in Europe, Germany risks not being among the top seeds when the 2022 World Cup qualification groups are drawn, likely at the end of next year.\n\nA successful Euro 2020 campaign would lift Germany up, and Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s team is on course to qualify from Group C where it is in first place, tied on points with Northern Ireland and three above the Netherlands, which has a game in hand.\n\nL\u00f6w called his goalkeeper rivalry \u201cthe smallest problem at the moment,\u201d though will give Barcelona\u2019s Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen a start against Argentina and restore captain Manuel Neuer against Estonia, which lost 8-0 to Germany in June.\n\nITALY INCENTIVE\n\nThere\u2019s a nice bonus awaiting the Italians if they qualify.\n\nThey would then be sure of playing in the opening game at Euro 2020 in Rome on June 12 in Group A, which is paired with Baku in the first Europe-wide edition of the competition.\n\nRAMOS RECORD\n\nSpain captain Sergio Ramos is set to break Iker Casillas\u2019 record of most appearances for the country on Saturday.\n\nThe central defender will play his 168th game with \u201cLa Roja\u201d when Spain visits Norway.\n\nWith 125 victories, the 33-year-old Ramos has already surpassed the goalkeeper\u2019s record for most wins with the Spanish national team.\n\nHOW QUALIFYING WORKS\n\nThe top two in each of the 10 groups qualify for the 24-team Euro 2020, which is being played in 12 countries with no automatic places for hosts.\n\nThe other four qualifiers will come through four tiers of playoffs in March. Lineups for the four-team knockout brackets in each tier are shaped by Nations League standings from one year ago.\n\nThe Euro 2020 tournament draw is made Nov. 30 in Bucharest, Romania. UEFA could have to modify the draw next April, if host nations qualify via the playoffs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Most of the continent's major soccer powers are in cruise control as they close in on qualification for next year's European Championship.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/britain_soccer_champions_league_90592_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
