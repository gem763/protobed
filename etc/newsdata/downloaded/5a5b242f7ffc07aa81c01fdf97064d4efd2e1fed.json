He will now allow three counts to proceed.\n\nJudge William O. Bertelsman of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky\u2019s new ruling means Sandmann\u2019s attorneys can start to gather discovery materials. Bertelsman agreed to permit discovery on three of 33 allegedly libelous statements by the Post in its coverage pertaining to Sandmann.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nThe lawsuit against the Washington Post for defaming Sandmann was earlier dismissed by the judge because of the media company\u2019s rights to free speech.\n\nThe case drew national attention because of the confusion over the interactions between Covington High School student Sandmann and Native American activist Nathan Phillips. Video of their Jan. 19 confrontation showed Sandmann smirking as Phillips banged a drum in close proximity.\n\nPhillips later claimed to media outlets that the students stood in his way and refused him passage, and the Sandmann smirk was taken up on social media as an arrogant and privileged affront, the notion fueled by his MAGA hat.\n\nHowever, other video of the confrontation determined that the students were waiting for a bus ride and that Phillips initiated the confrontation after racial slurs from a black activist group about the Covington group\u2019s MAGA hats drew attention, causing Phillips to wade into the crowd. Sandmann claimed he didn\u2019t know what to do, so he smiled to diffuse the tensions.\n\nJudge Bertelsman originally rejected the argument that the Washington Post implied inaccurately that Sandmann had behaved in a menacing or violent way. The statements that were alleged to be defamatory were actually about the Covington students as a group, not Sandmann individually, Bertelsman said.\n\n\u201cAnd while unfortunate, it is further irrelevant that Sandmann was scorned on social media,\u201d Bertelsman wrote.\n\nHowever, three statements from the newspaper\u2019s coverage refer to activist Nathan Phillips being blocked or impeded by Sandmann.\n\n\u201cThe Court will adhere to its previous rulings as they pertain to these statements, except Statements 10, 11, and 33, to the extent that these three statements state that plaintiff \u2018blocked\u2019 Nathan Phillips and \u2018would not allow him to retreat,\u2019\u201d said the Monday ruling. Suffice to say that the Court has given this matter careful review and concludes that \u2018justice requires\u2019 that discovery be had regarding these statements and their context. The Court will then consider them anew on summary judgment.\u201d\n\nSandmann\u2019s attorneys have also filed lawsuits against other media outlets, including CNN and NBCUniversal. His classmates have also initiated lawsuits stemming from the incident, naming Elizabeth Warren, Kathy Griffin and the New York Times Maggie Haberman, among others.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
