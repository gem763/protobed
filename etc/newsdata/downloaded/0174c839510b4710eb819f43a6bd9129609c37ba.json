An impeachment would be traumatic for the country and distract Congress from solving major domestic and foreign policy problems.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi:\n\n\u201cWe are here today because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton. And until the Republicans free themselves of this hatred, our country will suffer.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden (then a U.S. senator):\n\n\u201cIt would have been wrong for Richard Nixon to have been removed from office based upon a purely partisan vote. No president should be removed from office merely because one party enjoys a commanding lead in either house of the Congress \u2026\n\n\u201cIt is our constitutional duty to give the president the benefit of the doubt on the facts \u2026\n\n\u201cBrett Kavanaugh, who was associate independent counsel in Ken Starr\u2019s office for three years, put this argument most succinctly in a recent article he published in the Georgetown Law Journal: \u2018The President is not simply another individual. He is unique. He is the embodiment of the federal government and the head of a political party. If he is to be removed, the entire government likely would suffer, [and] the military or economic consequences to the nation could be severe\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cTo remove a president is to decapitate another branch and to undermine the independence necessary for it to fulfill its constitutional role \u2026 To remove a duly-elected president clashes with democratic principles in a way that simply has no constitutional parallel \u2026\n\n\u201cFederalist 65 also sounds a warning \u2013 again, it is a warning that has been invoked over and over again \u2013 that impeachments inevitably risk being hijacked by partisan political forces \u2026\n\n\u201cGiven the essentially anti-democratic nature of impeachment and the great dangers inherent in the too-ready exercise of that power, impeachment has no place in our system of constitutional democracy except as an extreme measure \u2013 reserved for breaches of the public trust by a president who so violates his official duties, misuses his official powers or places our system of government at such risk that our constitutional government is put in immediate danger by his continuing to serve out the term to which the people of the United States elected him \u2026\n\n\u201cFor one branch to remove the head of a co-equal branch unavoidably harms our constitutional structure \u2026\n\n\u201cI cautioned that we remember Alice\u2019s plight when the Queen declared \u2018sentence first, verdict afterwards\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cThe country is not well served when either policy disagreements or personal animosities drive the process \u2026\n\n\u201cI am here today to call for bipartisanship in the impeachment process. It is a concept many will say they agree with. But actions speak louder than words.\n\n\u201cThe Framers of the Constitution knew that the greatest danger associated with impeachment was the presence of partisan factions that could dictate the outcome.\n\n\u201cIt is clear from the debates and from the commentaries on the Constitutional Convention that the Framers were concerned that anything less than bipartisanship could, and would, do great damage to our form of government. They knew that to contemplate an action as profound as undoing a popular election requires at a minimum that members of both parties find that the alleged wrong is grave enough to overturn the will of the majority of the American people.\n\n\u201cThe Framers also understood the sentiment expressed nearly 200 years later by Congresswoman Barbara Jordan during the impeachment proceedings of Richard Nixon. She said, \u2018it is reason, and not passion, which must guide our deliberations, guide our debate, and guide our decision\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cIn the case of an impeachment, fair means bipartisan \u2026 Once the election is held, our leaders hold office until the next election. It is simply antithetical to our constitutional democracy to use impeachment to overturn an election on partisan grounds. It violates the independence of the presidency and it usurps the people\u2019s voice \u2026\n\n\u201cPermit one branch of government to subjugate another to its partisan wishes, and you permit the kind of concentration of power that can lead to tyranny. So the system the Framers established is utterly incompatible with the idea that sharp partisan divisions could be sufficient to impeach \u2026\n\n\u201cImpeachment can be legitimate if and only if it emanates from a bipartisan conviction that the president has committed high crimes and misdemeanors \u2013 when people of opposing viewpoints can come together in agreement over the seriousness of the offense and the appropriateness of the sanction \u2026\n\n\u201cLook back at the Nixon impeachment. It took on legitimacy when a core of Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee were moved by the nature of President Nixon\u2019s offenses to break party ranks and vote for articles of impeachment \u2026 There was bipartisan consensus that what Nixon did was impeachable \u2026\n\n\u201cBipartisanship should not wait until the matter reaches the Senate chamber \u2026\n\n\u201cThe Constitution provides that \u2018the Senate shall have sole power to try all impeachments.\u2019 Some consider this provision to impose a duty upon the Senate to try or adjudicate all impeachments. Even if the Constitution imposes such a duty, the Senate has not understood this duty to adjudicate as necessarily requiring a formal trial. There is precedent for the Senate considering dispositive motions that would allow the Senate to render a judgment without holding a trial.\u201d\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York:\n\n\u201cBenjamin Franklin called impeachment, \u2018a substitute for assassination\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cThe effect of impeachment is to overturn the popular will of the voters as expressed in a national election. We must not overturn an election and remove a president from office except to defend our very system of government or our constitutional liberties against a dire threat. And we must not do so without an overwhelming consensus of the American people and of their representatives in Congress of the absolute necessity \u2026\n\n\u201cThere must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment substantially supported by one of our major political parties and largely opposed by the other. Such an impeachment would lack legitimacy, would produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come. And will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions \u2026 We have no right to overturn the considered judgment of the American people \u2026\n\n\u201cTo impeach the president would subject the country to the trauma of a trial in the Senate. It would paralyze the government for many months while the problems of Social Security, Medicare, and a deteriorating world economy, and all our foreign concerns fester without proper attention \u2026\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s accusers must go beyond hearsay and innuendo and beyond demands that the president prove his innocence of vague and changing charges. They must provide clear and convincing evidence of specific impeachable conduct. \u2026\n\n\u201cSome say that if we do not impeach the president, we treat him as if he is above the law. Is the president above the law? Certainly not. He is subject to the criminal law, to indictment and prosecution when he leaves office like any other citizen, whether or not he is impeached.\u201d\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York:\n\n\u201cAn impeachment inquiry which will turn into an open-ended fishing expedition \u2026 The American people are smarter. They want this politically motivated witch hunt to end \u2026 Let\u2019s stop the politics. Let\u2019s really talk about bipartisanship.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York (then a member of the House):\n\n\u201cWhether you cite The Federalist Papers or legal scholars like Justice [Joseph] Story, the president\u2019s actions, while wrong and inappropriate and possibly illegal, are clearly not impeachable\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019d support a motion of censure or a motion to rebuke, as President Ford suggested yesterday, not because it is politically expedient to do but because the president\u2019s actions cry out for punishment and because censure or rebuke, not impeachment, is the right punishment.\n\n\u201cIt is time to move forward \u2026 the world economy is in crisis and cries out for American leadership \u2026 the American people cry out for us to solve the problems facing America like health care, education and ensuring that seniors have a decent retirement.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois:\n\n\u201cIn 1798, Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison: \u2018History shows that in England, impeachment has been an engine more of passion than justice.\u2019\n\n\u201cJefferson feared that even our process for impeachment could be a formidable partisan weapon. He feared that a determined faction in Congress would use it \u2018\u2026 for getting rid of any man whom they consider as dangerous to their views, and I do not know that we could count on one-third in an emergency.\u2019\u201d\n\nSenate Finance Committee ranking Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon:\n\n\u201cThis impeachment is a deadly plant that has flowered in the toxic soil of partisanship. Given the highly contentious nature of the charges against the president, there is no question in my mind that the congressional leadership should have first established a bipartisan process for investigating the serious allegations \u2026\n\n\u201cIn my view, the House didn\u2019t even try to locate the common ground \u2026 the fact is that by the end of last year, our two major political parties were at war with each other over the allegations against the president.\n\n\u201cThis toxic partisanship is not, in my view, what public service is all about\u2026.\n\n\u201cThe framers of the Constitution tried to give us a heads-up, a warning about how the impeachment process could become unduly partisan. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 65, said that the types of crimes for which impeachment is the appropriate remedy are \u2018political.\u2019 And he added, \u2018the prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties, more or less friendly, or inimical, to the accused\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and friends, it doesn\u2019t have to be all partisan all the time. There is an alternative to slash-and-burn government \u2026 the public is tired of us being at each other\u2019s throats. They are tired of Beltway politics that places toxic partisanship over the public interest\u2026\n\n\u201cCongress has not once removed a president, not once in 211 years. The Constitution places the burden for such a grave step very high. Such a showing is not only to protect our nation from partisan prosecution, but also to impose safeguards that are necessary, given the severity of the potential punishment \u2013 a political death penalty, as House Manager Lindsey Graham said.\n\n\u201cWhen I say \u2018punishment,\u2019 I am not only referring to the punishment imposed on the president, but in particular to the destructive impact of such an action to our nation as a whole \u2026\n\n\u201cIf the evidence required to convict a president of the United States in an impeachment trial is allowed to be less than that required in a shoplifting trial, the constitutional foundation for the presidency will disintegrate before our very eyes. That is something that a few future presidents in this body ought to consider for just a moment \u2026\n\n\u201cMy friends, let the toxic partisanship end. Let it end here, and let it end now.\u201d\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington state:\n\n\u201cIf we are to remove a President for the first time in our nation\u2019s history, none of us should have any doubts.\n\n\u201cWe must also ask ourselves how it would affect the country to remove this president after such a partisan process. A conversation I had with a constituent not long ago really struck a chord with me. He said to me,\n\n\u201c\u2019I am old enough to remember President Nixon\u2019s resignation. I know how deeply it affected the psyche of an entire generation. I know it made many of us cynical of politics for a long, long time. Please don\u2019t put us all through that turmoil again.\u2019 This country would be punished and hurt by a presidential removal. This country doesn\u2019t deserve to be punished for this president\u2019s behavior \u2026\n\n\u201cIn the past year, despite the scandal that ran on the front page nearly every day, our country has prospered. Our economy is growing. Our waters and air are cleaner. Our communities are safer. Our education system is stronger. America is not poised on the brink of disaster.\u201d\n\nHouse Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California:\n\n\u201cDemocracy is threatened when a fair legal process is sacrificed to appease the passions of a few \u2026 The power to impeach a president should not be casually used to remove a president, overturn an election, simply because we don\u2019t like him or his policies.\u201d\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson-Lee of Texas:\n\n\u201cThe Framers of the Constitution never intended the availability of impeachment as a license for a fishing expedition.\u201d\n\nRep. John Lewis of Georgia:\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, we should be standing here debating the future of Social Security. We should be standing here debating health care. We should be standing here debating education for our children and how we can protect the environment.\n\n\u201cInstead, we are participating in a political charade. Republicans want to do what they could not do in an election \u2013 defeat Bill Clinton. Well, I have news for you. The American people are watching. Beware the wrath of the American people, Mr. Speaker, beware.\u201d\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York:\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to you, my colleagues, as a woman, as a mother, as a grandmother and as a lawmaker. Let us have a formal rebuke of this behavior, but then let us move forward in this House, because I want to make it very clear that we believe it is immoral not to be rebuilding our schools, not to be taking care of our children, not to be focusing on health care, and not to preserve Social Security and Medicare.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Written by Thomas McArdle\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
