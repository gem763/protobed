REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer\n\nAs Britain was activating plans for its biggest peacetime repatriation, two smaller operators, Aigle Azur and XL Airways, were before the French bankruptcy courts on Monday.\n\nShares in larger airlines rose on expectations that Thomas Cook\u2019s demise would bring them more passengers, higher fares and new airport slots. But many are wrestling with similar problems.\n\n\u201cWe expect all the airlines we cover to rally today but we caution investors not to get over-exuberant, given other challenges,\u201d said J.P. Morgan analyst David Perry - citing higher fuel prices, a strong dollar and cut-throat competition.\n\nThe list of sector bankruptcies is growing: Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia failed in 2017, followed by Primera and Cobalt last year and Germania, Flybmi and Iceland\u2019s WOW so far in 2019. Regional operator Flybe\u2019s sale to a Virgin Atlantic-led consortium has narrowly averted its collapse.\n\nLarger European carriers are not immune from the threat.\n\nThird-ranked low-cost operator Norwegian Air, which has bled cash while making inroads in the transatlantic market, won a reprieve from creditors last week, postponing repayment on $380 million in debt for up to two years.\n\nLast week\u2019s oil price spike that followed attacks on Saudi infrastructure will have a knock-on effect for kerosene prices that were already running high.\n\nBREXIT \u2018LAST STRAW\u2019\n\nThe strong dollar has further inflated prices for fuel and plane leases - two of the sector\u2019s biggest costs that are usually billed in the U.S. currency.\n\nFor British operators the problem is exacerbated by the pound\u2019s slide, amid worries over the country\u2019s impending European Union exit. At Thomas Cook, currency effects likely increased some leasing costs averaging $250,000 per jet by about a quarter once converted into sterling, industry sources said.\n\nThe venerable travel brand also suffered from deliberate price-slashing by rivals TUI and Jet2, Bernstein analyst Richard Clarke said, and a \u201cflood of cheap flights\u201d from online-only operators.\n\nBut he added: \u201cBrexit was likely the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nEuropean airline traffic has grown 1.6% so far this year, according to air traffic control body Eurocontrol, about half the rate assumed in industry capacity plans. That has made it harder to fill planes or raise fares, adding earnings pressure that can be eased by bankruptcies or mergers.\n\nThe liquidation of Thomas Cook\u2019s 1% share of the market for European flights is unlikely to bring much relief on its own.\n\nShares in easyJet, seen as one of the more likely airline beneficiaries, were nonetheless 3.2% higher at 1345 GMT, with Air France-KLM up by 1.5%, Lufthansa by 0.6% and Ryanair 0.4%.\n\nFRAGMENTED\n\nSmaller airlines are more vulnerable in part because they struggle to cover fixed costs accounting for a sizeable share of their budgets for maintenance, training and other essentials.\n\nXL Airways, which was in court to be placed under bankruptcy protection on Monday, last year transported 730,000 passengers, mainly to the West Indies and Reunion Island.\n\nIn another courtroom on the other side of Paris, bidders including IAG\u2019s Vueling and a former Air France executive were presenting offers for Aigle Azur. Between them, the two carriers employ 1,700 staff and operate 15 Airbus jets.\n\nEurope\u2019s fragmented market of small carriers reflects impediments to consolidation that prevent them merging to gain critical mass - including third-country flying rights deals that remain national - and can thwart rescues when they fail.\n\nAir France withdrew an offer for Aigle Azur last week after it became clear absorbing the carrier would require a complex deal with its own unions. EasyJet also dropped out.\n\nPhil Seymour, chief executive at UK aviation consulting firm IBA, believes the biggest single threat remains the strong dollar, \u201cagainst the euro and particularly against the pound.\u201d\n\nMultiple strains on the sector will continue to push airlines towards bankruptcy, he said. \u201cWe expect to see more.\u201d", "description": "The collapse of travel group Thomas Cook and a trio of subsidiary airlines, leaving 600,000 holidaymakers stranded, is unlikely to be the last failure among Europe's struggling second-tier carriers.", "authors": ["Laurence Frost", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432992712&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1CS", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
