Kim paid a visit to the factory last August as part of move to encourage economic development.\n\nKim, who had strongly condemned the lack of visible modernization last time, said during this visit that \"the factory was given a complete facelift and its look changed fundamentally.\"\n\nHe criticized, however, \"the insufficient quality of the construction that comes short of the needs of design and engineering,\" KCNA said, adding that he promised to send a highly skilled construction unit soon to fix the problems and complete the factory flawlessly by the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Daniel Wallis and; Sandra Maler)", "description": "North Korea said on Sunday there has been no progress in the North Korea-United States relations, and hostilities that could lead to an exchange of fire have continued, according to North Korea's state news agency KCNA.
