He was also reportedly booed during the interview, and some in the audience reportedly walked out on the event.\n\n\"Tomorrow there will be stories about how horribly Bob Woodward bombed this discussion,\" journalist J. David McSwane wrote. \u201cRepeatedly asked why Harvey Weinstein did what he did. The authors responded, multiple times: power. He accused them of dodging the question.\u201d\n\nTechnology journalist Kara Swisher described Woodward as \"Interruptive, not focused on the women who were victimized by Harvey Weinstein and weirdly obsessed with that creep, it\u2019s a exercise in how not to interview. The crowd no like.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving a really fun time listening to Bob Woodward repeatedly interrupt and badger Jodi Kantor & Megan Twohey on why Weinstein did what he did & then charging them with purposely \u201cdodging\u201d the question to repeated boos, audience outbursts, and people walking out,\u201d Anna Kain, who attended the event, also wrote.\n\nA lengthy thread of tweets from Twitter user Robyn Swirling, which was retweeted by several other women who claimed to have been in the audience, also accused Woodward of \u201caggressive and uninformed questioning.\u201d She said Woodward failed to understand rape culture and sped through a discussion about consent, \u201cShowing exactly why he was the wrong person to have any sort of public (or private) discussion about #metoo.\u201d\n\nWoodward also received pushback for asking why the two authors believed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanagh despite her lacking a clear recollection of the alleged sexual assault from her high school years. @NikkiMcR wrote: \u201cBob Woodward just asked Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey if Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s story was 'worth publishing' and i\u2019ve never been more disgusted.\u201d\n\n\"Maybe men should take a break from moderating conversations about women,\" author Jessica Valenti added.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAccording to Swirling\u2019s account, Woodward asked the two journalists 'did you find any women who made up allegations? That's very important.'\u201d\n\nOther Twitter users also took issue with the exchange.\n\n\u201cListening to NYT reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey talk about their book She Said and interviewer Bob Woodward can\u2019t talk about anything but Weinstein\u2019s sex drive.
