Why not? After all, the e-buses are more efficient, much more silent and negligibly harmful for the environment in comparison with their diesel engine counterparts. But as we have seen time and again, humans have a tendency of blemishing the natural state of affairs. So can one, knowingly or unknowingly, convert these green electric buses into a polluting mode of transport? Yes we can!\n\nThat is exactly what happened to one of the electric buses of Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML). A recent clip being viral on social media shows the electric bus being charged through a diesel generator instead of a standard electric charger. Result? Spew of smoke being released into the air to run a vehicle that apparently runs emission-free.\n\nSeriously? @PMCPune\n\nUsing a diesel generator to charge e-bus?\n\nWhy on earth someone would do that?\n\nPolluting atmosphere to charge bus battery and then using electronic bus to save atmosphere?@PuneCityTraffic@ThePuneMirror@punedaily@AnilShiroleBJP@MlaJagdishMulik pic.twitter.com/FQwvYBze9x \u2014 Himanshu Paliwal (@him_paliwal) October 9, 2019\n\nAs of now, there are some unknowns about the clip. For instance, it is not known where these electric buses are being charged through the generator. They are not at the Pune Depot as it is known to have electric chargers. Also, who is to be blamed for a practice like this? Whether it was the bus driver\u2019s decision or that of the PMPML authority\u2019s to charge the electric bus through an electric generator? Know one has taken the blame so far.\n\nThat being said, there are also facts which can be figured out from the video. The electric bus being displayed in it is a BYD-Olectra. Such buses are regularly inducted into the PMPML service. The one in question was a part of 20 BYD electric buses being delivered to PMPML in the most recent batch, as per users on Twitter.\n\nDon't Miss 205 SHARES 294 SHARES 513 SHARES 218 SHARES\n\nIn response to the viral video of a PMPML e-Bus being recharged using a Diesel Generator.\n\nE-Buses are manufactured by the company in Hyderabad, as per contract the buses are to be delivered post inspection in Pune. (1/3) \u2014 Siddharth Shirole (@SidShirole) October 13, 2019\n\nTwitterati says that the video has been filmed on-route to Pune from Hyderabad, at a location called Solapur. During the delivery of these electric buses, they had to be charged through the generator at Solapur citing the lack of charging stations at the location. It was mandatory to charge them in order to complete their Hyderabad to Pune trip. The buses have a range of 230 km as of now.\n\nThe underlying problem\n\nWe cannot blame any particular entity in such a scenario. If fingers have to be pointed nonetheless, they can be pointed towards the lack of charging infrastructure in the country. Recently a similar case was experience in Srinagar, where the electric buses were present but no charging infrastructure to charge them was in place. The e-buses, hence sat idle. If the electric buses themselves can\u2019t make it across states without having to charge through diesel generators, the range anxiety of EV owners in India is only going to worsen.\n\nThat is when one tends to realise whether inducting more EVs into the mainstream transportation is a good idea at present or not. Because if it is, then charging them through a diesel generator is certainly not the ideal way of operation.", "description": "PMPML has recently inducted a number of electric buses into its transportation fleet.
