A terrible hard time is now over, and now a very important chapter begins.\n\n\"Zen is doing well right now, but strict quarantine, monitoring, and follow-up. I hope everything will be fine here too.\"\n\nThe medication uses gene therapy, is developed in the US, and is not yet registered either in Hungary or the EU.\n\nIn a clinical trial of the drug, 36 children with SMA received the treatment before they were two and by the end of the trial, none of them needed a permanent ventilation system to breathe.\n\nHungarian authorities issued a special permit for the use of the drug in Zente\u2019s case.\n\nSMA is a group of neuromuscular disorders that result in the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting.", "description": "The drug, Zolgensma, costs \u20ac2.2m for one treatment.
