It was disclosed as part of a civil action brought by nearly 2,000 cities, towns and counties alleging nearly two dozen drug companies conspired to saturate the nation with opioids. The database is a virtual road map to the epidemic.\n\nThe Post\u2019s analysis found:\n\n\u2022 America\u2019s largest drug companies distributed 76 billion oxycodone and hydrocodone pain pills across the country between 2006 and 2012 as the nation\u2019s deadliest drug epidemic spun out of control. Just six companies distributed 75 percent of the pills during this period.\n\n\u2022 The volume of the pills handled by the companies climbed as the epidemic surged, increasing 51 percent from 8.4 billion in 2006 to 12.6 billion in 2012. The states that received the highest concentrations of pills per person per year were: West Virginia, Kentucky and South Carolina.\n\n\u2022 Opioid death rates soared in the communities that were flooded with pain pills. The national death rate from opioids was 4.6 deaths per 100,000 residents. But the counties that had the most pills distributed per person experienced more than three times that rate on average.\n\nMore on this coverage\n\nRead more on The Opioid Files\n\n\u2022 Drilling into the DEA\u2019s pain pill database\n\n\u2022 They were devastated by pain pills.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nIn early 2016, The Post began investigating how hundreds of millions of highly addictive pain pills that are sent along a tightly regulated pharmaceutical supply chain were fueling a growing, deadly epidemic.\n\n\u2022 Starting in 2006, the DEA launched an aggressive campaign to curb the rising opioid epidemic, targeting companies that distributed pills and the corrupt pharmacies and pill mills that illegally diverted the drugs to the black market. But the industry fought back.\n\n\u2022 Thirteen drug distributors should have known that hundreds of millions of pills were ending up on the black market, according to court records, DEA documents and legal settlements in administrative \u00adcases reviewed by The Post. Even when the companies were alerted to suspicious pain clinics or pharmacies, some distributors continued to send drugs.\n\n\u2022 Pharmaceutical companies have hired dozens of officials from the top levels of the DEA during the past decade. The hires came after the DEA launched an aggressive campaign to curb the rising opioid epidemic.\n\n2017\n\nIn 2017, reporters dug deeper into the issue, working with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d to explore in greater depth the pressure that had been exerted on Congress by the drug industry and its lobbyists and its impact on some key DEA investigations into large drug companies.\n\n\u2022 At the height of the deadliest drug epidemic in U.S. history, Congress effectively stripped the DEA of its most potent weapon against large drug companies. The law was the crowning achievement of a multifaceted campaign by the drug industry to weaken DEA enforcement efforts.\n\n\u2022 After two years of painstaking investigation, a DEA team was ready to move on the biggest opioid distribution case in U.S. history. Instead, top attorneys at the DEA and the Justice Department struck a deal that was far more lenient than the field agents wanted, according to interviews and internal government documents.\n\n\u2022 In 2012, distributor Cardinal Health got word that the DEA was about to take action against a Florida warehouse that supplied millions of painkillers every month. Cardinal retained Washington lawyer Jamie Gorelick, who had served as deputy U.S. attorney general from 1994 to 1997. She reached out to her old agency on the company\u2019s behalf, and the impact was immediate.\n\n2018 and 2019\n\n\n\nInmates in the women\u2019s cellblock at the Fayette County Jail in Washington Court House, Ohio, a state hit hard by the country\u2019s fentanyl crisis. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, The Post turned its focus to the synthetic painkiller fentanyl, the latest wave of the opioid crisis, which claimed the lives of about 30,000 that year. Pain pill addiction had given rise to heroin use, which in turn created a soaring demand for fentanyl, which is 50 times as powerful as heroin.\n\n\u2022 Federal officials failed to grasp how quickly fentanyl was creating another \u2014 and far more fatal \u2014 wave of the epidemic. In the span of a few years, fentanyl became the drug scourge of our time. If current trends continue, the annual death toll from fentanyl will soon approach the yearly toll from guns or traffic accidents.\n\n\u2022 The depth of the fentanyl problem continues to overwhelm the government\u2019s response, and the administration has yet to produce a comprehensive strategy that is legally required by Congress.
