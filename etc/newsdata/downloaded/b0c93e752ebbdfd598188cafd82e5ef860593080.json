That put the 10-year yield higher than the yield on the three-month Treasury, which declined slightly to 1.676%, making the spread between them roughly a basis point.\n\nIt's the first time that the spread between the two \u2014 called the yield curve \u2014 has been positive since July. This is important because an inversion of the three-month and 10-year spread has preceded every US recession since 1950.\n\nThe reason for the yield curve reversion was the market's positive reaction to news on trade between the US and China, as well as Brexit, Charlie Ripley, a senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, told Markets Insider in an interview.\n\nMarkets rallied after President Trump tweeted that \"good things are happening\" early Friday, indicating that trade negotiations between the US and China were going well into the second day in Washington. In Europe, there are also signs of progress with Brexit as the EU agreed to enter talks with Boris Johnson.\n\n\"We're seeing rates lifted on that positive news and equities are following,\" Ripley said.\n\nRead more: Nobel laureate Robert Shiller forewarned investors about the dot-com and housing bubbles. Now he tells us which irrational market behaviors have him most worried.\n\nThe boost in equities and the sell-off in treasuries spilled over into other assets as well. Gold, traditionally a safe-haven asset that investors flock to when they're worried about risk, fell further below $1,500 an ounce, a key psychological level.\n\nHaving the yield curve back in positive territory could be a good sign for the future, according to Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.\n\n\"US recession risk has primarily been driven by weakness associate with the US/China trade war, so good news in that arena should lower recession risk, and therefore the need for Fed cuts,\" she told Markets Insider in an email.\n\nSo far, the market seems to agree. The probability of a rate cut at the Fed's October meeting dropped to 66.8%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Last week, traders were forecasting the probability of a 25 to 50 basis point cut as high as 90%.\n\nBut even though the yield curve is now in the green, an inversion is still a good signal that a recession could be on the horizon, Ripley said.\n\n\"For us it brings up that it's something to keep an eye on, but we're looking at other things\" as well, he said.\n\nGoing forward, he'll keep an eye on business sentiment, which has been low, and jobless claims, an important measure of the health of the labor market.\n\nRead more: A strategist with JPMorgan's $1.7 trillion asset-management business says trade and politics will keep investors in 'purgatory' for more than a year \u2014 but thinks these 4 strategies can help them break out", "description": "The spread between three-month and 10-year US Treasury bonds turned positive on Friday for the first time since July.
