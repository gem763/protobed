How do I know? Because the Office for National Statistics says we are. Have you noticed a new happiness vibe? Can\u2019t say I have to be honest.\n\nHave you found yourself becoming progressively chucklesome over the past year? Are the occupants of the No 73 bus suddenly full of joie de vivre and bonhomie as they draw closer to work each morning?\n\nNah, \u2019fraid not. And, if you don\u2019t mind, I won\u2019t have the ONS telling me I\u2019m happy, when I\u2019m mostly not. If you must know, I\u2019m mostly anxious and low-level depressed, with an overriding sense of \u2018is this IT?\u2019 Is this REALLY IT? Is this what our kids will inherit?\n\nI worry about the longevity of our disposable planet as the world grows ever more madder and crowded.\n\nRegular journeys on the London Underground \u2013 amazing, efficient and very useful, though it is \u2013 will convince one, if one needs convincing, that the world is now entirely populated by rude, selfish people, who think nothing of jostling other human beings out of the way as they head for their squeezed-in, stand-up journey to toil at a desk.\n\nI\u2019m fearful of the consequences of the almighty, totally unnecessary Brexit wrench.\n\nAnd scared stiff of another term of Boris at the helm of this once great, now fractured, country.\n\nI\u2019m wondering how, in one of the most worrisome times since the end of the Second World War, the Office for National Statistics has come to the conclusion that during this unstable, uncertain, uncalled for period in history \u2013 characterised by its raft of lies, splits and divisions and the creation of an unnecessary, messy, huge scar on our relationship with our European allies \u2013 we are \u201cbecoming happier\u201d with our lot.\n\nDuring a time in our history in which anxiety levels have risen in line with the absurdity of events, how can these anxiety levels be down? Nearly everyone I know, including my sons and my stoic, unflappable husband, have experienced horrible, prohibitive anxiety.\n\nOne can only conclude, then, that the Office for National Statistics has been talking to robots rather than us flustered-beyond-coping, stressed-out human beings.\n\nDaily Mirror news", "description": "The Office for National Statistics says we are all becoming happier.
