A phone call the two men held in July had triggered a political crisis in Washington, and the fourth impeachment proceedings ever against a US president.\n\nAccording to the version released by the White House, when Zelenskiy asked Trump about US military support for his embattled country, Trump said: \u201cI would like you to do us a favour though\u201d and went on to suggest, repeatedly, that Zelenskiy\u2019s government launch an investigation into Trump\u2019s possible opponent in next year\u2019s presidential elections, Joe Biden.\n\nShortly before the call, Trump is reported to have ordered US military aid to Ukraine to be suspended.\n\nThe incident sounded sufficiently like a shakedown to push even a reluctant Democratic leadership into embarking on impeachment. As far as Trump was concerned, however, there was nothing wrong with the conversation which, he said again and again, was \u201cperfect\u201d.\n\nSitting alongside the US president, Zelenskiy looked very much like the high school teacher-turned-president he used to play on his longrunning political sitcom, The Servant of the People, bewildered at the absurdities unfolding before him.\n\n\u201cBetter to be on TV than on the phone,\u201d he joked, though nothing about his demeanour suggested that was true. He looked unhappy from the beginning, and when Trump turned to him and declared: \u201cI really hope you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem\u201d, Zelenskiy looked like he was going to be sick.\n\nHis \u201cproblem\u201d was that part of his country had been annexed by Putin, and Russian military intervention had turned another part into a battleground. Hours before meeting Trump, the Ukrainian leader had stood in front of the UN general assembly and held up a bullet in an effort to remind the international community of the largely forgotten conflict.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as someone else\u2019s war,\u201d Zelenskiy had said. \u201cNone of you will be able to feel safe as long as there is a war in Ukraine, a war in Europe.\u201d\n\nIn his afternoon encounter with Trump, the war was quickly forgotten once more and the Ukrainian president found that, on his debut on the global stage, he had wandered into a whodunnit in which he was prime witness.\n\nSo had his arm been twisted by Trump to investigate Joe Biden? the press wanted to know. Zelenskiy\u2019s discomfort was overwhelming. On one hand, his government\u2019s relationship with the US, its most important military backer, was at stake. On the other, his side of the July conversation made him sound like a sycophant, constantly flattering Trump and offering to take guidance from the US president in domestic Ukrainian investigations. It was unlikely to play well back home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a meeting with Donald Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cWe had a good phone call\u2026 It was normal. You read it. Nobody pushed me.\u201d\n\nThat was all Trump needed. A couple of hours later, he flourished the phrase like a get-out-of-jail card.\n\n\u201cNo push, no pressure, no nothing. It\u2019s all a big hoax,\u201d Trump said. But at his first press conference as a president formally facing impeachment, he appeared deflated and consumed with self-pity.\n\nOne by one, he listed all the countries whose leaders he had met over three days at the UN.\n\n\u201cI came early in the morning to late in the evening, meeting with different countries, all for the good of our country and the press didn\u2019t cover any of this,\u201d Trump said, reprising a favourite theme when under pressure: that none of his predecessors \u2013 presumably not even Lincoln who was shot in the head \u2013 had suffered as much.\n\n\u201cSo many leaders came up to me today and they said, sir, what you go through, no president has ever gone through,\u201d the president said.\n\nTrump seemed to be untouchable \u2013 that may have just changed Read more\n\nFor more than 20 minutes, he read through a rambling litany of his achievements, from domestic to foreign but ending up at the wall on the southern border, and allowed only a couple of questions.\n\nWhen asked whether it was appropriate for a US president to use his office to persuade a foreign leader to dig up dirt on his opponents, Trump accused his opponents of doing the same thing. It looked likely to be his strategy through the long months of impeachment that lie ahead for his presidency. His enemies had simply projected their own wrongdoing on to him, and he was the hero betrayed in the final act.\n\n\u201cIt was all planned,\u201d he concluded darkly. \u201cLike everything else it was all planned and the witch hunt continues.\u201d", "description": "Sitting down in front of cameras at the UN, Zelenskiy looked miserable and Trump rambled about his achievements", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02e6d85156772a8653fea35de43b7d85ca2e7c0e/0_132_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65652218c9da3f0862047a357890de3e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
