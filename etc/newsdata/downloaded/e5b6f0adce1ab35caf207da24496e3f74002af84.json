A defensive mix-up between defender Jan Bednarek and goalkeeper Angus Gunn saw the Southampton players collide and tumble to the ground, allowing Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson the simple task of walking the ball into the net.\n\nNathan Ake\u2019s 10th-minute header and Harry Wilson\u2019s sweeping finish in the 35th gave Bournemouth a 2-0 lead by halftime, with the visitors also having a penalty decision overturned by the video assistant referee because of an offside against Josh King.\n\nSouthampton improved after halftime and pulled a goal back through James Ward-Prowse\u2019s 53rd-minute penalty, awarded after Che Adams was brought down by Steve Cook.\n\nBournemouth resisted late pressure from Southampton before Wilson clinched the win in the fifth minute of injury time, with his fourth goal in three games.\n\nBournemouth moved onto 10 points, the same number as second-place Manchester City.\n\n\u201dIt is way too early but obviously it\u2019s great to be here,\u201d Ake said of Bournemouth\u2019s current position in the top four.\n\nIt was the first game in the sixth round of the Premier League.\n\nBournemouth had previously drawn six and lost nine of the 15 games played away against Southampton in all competitions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At the 16th attempt, Bournemouth finally earned a victory at the home of south-coast rival Southampton.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/britain_soccer_premier_league_44159_c0-100-2392-1494_s1770x1032.jpg?2dca27cba0047c721c1c7aa8b84eb64e0fa00110", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
