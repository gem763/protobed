In fact index scores rose in all the cities in the eurozone UBS evaluated.\n\nThe European Central Bank this month further lowered its main deposit rate into negative territory.\n\n\u201cThe expected economic slowdown \u2013 in particular in Germany \u2013 will test current price levels,\u201d UBS said. Germany\u2019s economy contracted in the second quarter, and many forecasters expect the same in the third quarter.\n\nAffordability issues, political uncertainty and less favorable tax treatment are putting pressure on house prices in London, UBS said, as Britain\u2019s capital city moved out of bubble risk territory.\n\nBy contrast, none of the U.S. cities \u2014 New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles \u2014 rose in the bubble index, the first time that\u2019s happened since 2011. UBS says Chicago is undervalued, but its increasing fiscal challenges have caused it to lag far behind.\n\nThe UBS index is a weighted average of price-to-income, price-to-rent, mortgage-to-GDP, construction-to-GDP and relative price-city-to-country indicators.", "description": "The UBS global real estate bubble index evaluates 24 cities annually, and what was notable about this year\u2019s edition was the rise of European property prices.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS280_munich_ZG_20190930051533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
