I\u2019ve released 21 years of my tax returns,\u201d he said. \u201cI entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government... I made no money while I was in there other than my salary.\u201d\n\nBiden is referring, of course, to Trump\u2019s refusal to release his returns, citing several reasons like he\u2019s under audit and voter\u2019s don\u2019t care.\n\nI won the 2016 Election partially based on no Tax Returns while I am under audit (which I still am), and the voters didn\u2019t care. Now the Radical Left Democrats want to again relitigate this matter. Make it a part of the 2020 Election! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2019\n\nBut, according to CNN, Sam Nunberg, a Trump adviser from 2011 to 2015, suggests the president simply doesn\u2019t want to show how little he\u2019s paid.\n\nThat\u2019s not good enough for Biden. \u201cEven Richard Nixon released his tax returns,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s the clip that quickly caught fire across Twitter:\n\n.@realDonaldTrump, you want to talk about corruption? I\u2019ve released 21 years of my tax returns \u2014 release yours or shut up. pic.twitter.com/5JFDINCSeQ \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 16, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Biden continues to fend off allegations of corruption of his own. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d he said during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, pushing back as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry over his request to have Ukraine look into Biden and his son, Hunter.", "description": "Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden delivered a Twitter ultimatum to Trump on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD735_biden_ZG_20190211135403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
