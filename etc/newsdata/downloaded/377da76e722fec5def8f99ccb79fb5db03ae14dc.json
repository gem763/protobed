She was found, to the relief of her daughter Laura Bereta (R). (Photo: Courtesy of Laura Bereta)\n\nA 62-year-old woman with dementia, who disappeared for 10 days, survived in part off a diet of creek water and possibly, minnows.\n\nOn Sept.17, Linda Field of Porter, Texas, disappeared from the home she shares with her daughter, Laura Bereta, after stealing her daughter\u2019s car before it was time to pick up her grandson from school. \u201cShe wanted to go for a little joyride,\u201d Bereta, 35, tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nWhile warming up the car, Bereta dashed inside the house, leaving Field sitting on the front porch. \u201cMom didn\u2019t want to come to school and she is allowed to stay home alone for short periods of time,\u201d says Bereta. However, while her daughter was in the house, Field snuck into the red 1999 Ford Explorer and drove off.\n\nBereta called her mother\u2019s boyfriend and her aunt, who live in nearby Cleveland and New Caney. Then she contacted the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office in Conroe, reporting that Field was missing and has dementia. While a friend picked up her son, Bereta waited at home. Meanwhile, the police searched the neighborhood and the Porter community. At 10 p.m., Field still hadn\u2019t resurfaced, so Bereta filed a missing person\u2019s report.\n\nEventually, without any leads to her mother\u2019s whereabouts, Bereta initiated a silver alert, a notification issued by The Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) for missing people with medical conditions. In June, Field was diagnosed with dementia and Bereta quit her job as custodian of a school district to care for her mom full-time.\n\n\u201cI was freaking out,\u201d Bereta tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThere was no telling where she could have gone \u2014 a few days earlier, she talked about visiting Montana, which I didn\u2019t take seriously.\u201d Comforted by the fact that her car had less than a tank of gas and her mother had no money, Bereta didn\u2019t believe her mother could travel far.\n\nDuring the first few nights of her mother\u2019s disappearance, Bereta couldn\u2019t sleep, checking social media feeds for updates and watching her driveway. The nights she could manage sleep, she tossed and turned. \u201cIt drove me nuts,\u201d she says. \u201cI finally put my phone down because I was so stressed out.\u201d\n\nField could have visited the spot where her ex-husband\u2019s ashes were sprinkled, but Bereta couldn\u2019t recall the location. And a friend swore she spotted the woman at a local Dollar Tree. Hopeful, Bereta organized a search party near the store, but she would soon call it off. On Sept. 27, the police announced that Field had been found, approximately one hour away from Porter.\n\n\n\n\n\nA press release sent to Yahoo Lifestyle from Lieutenant Scott Spencer stated, \u201cMontgomery County Sheriff\u2019s Office is happy to announce that the missing adult Linda Field, who went missing from her home in Porter, Texas on September 17, 2019, has been found. On the afternoon of September 27, 10 days after Linda went missing, her vehicle was observed by a citizen in a wooded area near the end of Donahoe Road in Cold Spring Texas. Deputies from San Jacinto County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Montgomery County Sheriff\u2019s Office along with canine handlers from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and Allegiance Mobile Health Services staff searched the area for two hours. Linda was found alive in a creek bed approximately 200-300 yards from the nearest residence. Linda was transported to the Livingston Hospital due to dehydration and fatigue, but we are thankful she was found safe.\u201d\n\nField told ABC 13, \u201cI knew I was going to be found. It was God\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nBereta\u2019s car was found with a broken bumper and side mirror, and Field was scratched up with bug bites, but otherwise healthy. However, details of her disappearance are scarce. \u201cShe has medical issues, and was severely dehydrated and weak when we found her,\u201d Spencer tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWe are just thankful that we found her, she is safe, and has been reunited with family.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by Yahoo Lifestyle about Field\u2019s survival tactics, Spencer says, \u201cI believe she told deputies she ate minnows and drank creek water.\u201d However, according to Bereta, her mother claims that she only ingested the water, not minnows.\n\n\u201cMy mother never explained what she did all day,\u201d Bereta tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cOnly that, \u2018It was a journey for God.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince she was found, Field has been nervous to go outside and worried about being alone. And Bereta says she will stick by her mother\u2019s side. But the extent of her mother\u2019s disappearance will remain a mystery. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever know the whole truth.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A Texas grandmother was found alive and well after stealing her daughter's car and disappearing for 10 days.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QgpmKOYWGvjLQX9uBo55rA--~B/aD0zNjEyO3c9MjcwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/55ff0160-e55f-11e9-acff-15e548e61bbf", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
