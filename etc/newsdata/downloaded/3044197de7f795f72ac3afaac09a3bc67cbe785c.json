So before Andreescu hoisted the hardware she earned Saturday with her 6-3, 7-5 victory over Serena Williams, she leaned toward a tournament official and asked which side was the front.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to make sure so I didn\u2019t look like an idiot,\u201d Andreescu said.\n\nChances are, she\u2019ll do fine in the future. With her game \u2013 and her guts \u2013 Canada\u2019s first Grand Slam singles champion could have many more opportunities to win major titles.\n\nJust ask Williams\u2019 coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, who referred to Andreescu as a \u201cfuture No. 1.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith her character and mindset, for sure she\u2019s going to win several Grand Slams,\u201d Mouratoglou said.\n\nWilliams has won 23 of them, one shy of the record, and with all that experience and the home-court advantage, many people considered Andreescu\u2019s victory an upset.\n\nTruth is, it\u2019s never a surprise when she wins.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t been on the short end of a completed match in six months, losing only when she had to stop playing in one match because of a shoulder injury. Andreescu is 34-4 this year with one major and two other prestigious tournament titles, a record that compared to Rafael Nadal\u2019s as he prepared to play in the men\u2019s final.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost a match since March, so my confidence is skyrocketing right now,\u201d said Andreescu, who will rise to No. 5 in the rankings. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to take anything for granted because there\u2019s going to be weeks where you\u2019re going to lose, so right now I\u2019m just on cloud nine and hopefully I can just keep the momentum going.\u201d\n\nShe couldn\u2019t even get into main draw of the U.S. Open last year after losing in qualifying. But Andreescu thought she could be headed for big things right from the start of this season, when she reached the final of her first event in New Zealand. Then she won the title in Indian Wells in March, before the shoulder injuries that forced her to miss most of the spring and summer seasons.\n\nAndreescu said she didn\u2019t have much faith in herself during those times, relying on her parents and her team to keep her spirits up.\n\n\u201cAlso, I mean, it\u2019s part of life going through situations like that,\u201d Andreescu said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always going to be butterflies and rainbows, so I just tried to embrace it as much as I could. I tried to learn different things about myself and just about how I can get better as a player and as a person, and I really believed that there were going to be good times ahead, because I think when you believe in that then all those tough times are worth it.\u201d\n\nAndreescu finally was able to return to the WTA Tour in time for her home tournament last month in Toronto, where she won the title when Williams had to stop playing in the final because of back spasms. But she had to go the distance to beat Williams on Saturday, playing through a deafening crowd during Williams\u2019 second-set comeback that Andreescu felt was even louder than the ones at the Toronto Raptors\u2019 playoff games she attended this spring on their way to the NBA title.\n\n\u201cWe The North\u201d \u2013 the Raptors\u2019 slogan \u2013 has given way to \u201cShe The North.\u201d\n\nAndreescu played \u201cmostly fearless for a big part of the match. A big, big part of the match,\u201d said Sylvain Bruneau, her coach.\n\n\u201cShe could have been a little bit intimidated for many reasons. Serena, the stadium, the world is watching.\u201d\n\nBut Andreescu wasn\u2019t, even though she was playing in only her fourth Grand Slam tournament.\n\nBruneau also was confused during another award presentation later Saturday night, when the coach of the winning player is given a replica trophy. As he posed for pictures with Andreescu, someone had to tell him to turn the trophy around because he had the wrong side facing forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not used to this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell, get used to it,\u201d Andreescu responded.", "description": "With her game and her guts, Canada's first Grand Slam singles champion could have many more opportunities to win major titles.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/R9KQC_h8sPLdj6OcM1R.6g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DdCgdV7RwpyuCaUQb30MFg--~B/aD04NDg7dz0xNTA2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/peter_king_on_nbc_sports_543/4ad0146f832dc48626aa95bb381c83ad", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
