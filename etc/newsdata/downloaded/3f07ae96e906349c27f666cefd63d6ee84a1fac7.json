Photo: Yong Teck Lim/Getty Images\n\nLeBron James is not a politician. This feels like a weird thing to have to say, even though, as I\u2019ve argued in the past, maybe someday he should become one. But he\u2019s going to be treated like one from now on. This is partly his fault, but not entirely.\n\nAfter days of avoiding any discussion of the China-NBA scandal that has now reached its second full week \u2014 to the point that even ESPN is having shows canceled because its talent liked Daryl Morey\u2019s initial tweet \u2014 LeBron finally spoke up Monday night. It is fair to say his message was \u2026 let\u2019s go with \u201cmuddled.\u201d LeBron said Morey\u2019s tweet in support of the Hong Kong protesters was \u201cmisinformed,\u201d which was almost certainly the worst possible thing he could have said in the situation. (He might have even been better off sticking to James Harden\u2019s \u201cWe apologize! We love China!\u201d) LeBron looked self-centered rather than pragmatic (worrying only about the NBA\u2019s and his own profit rather than the actual issue at hand), hectoring and condescending (as Deadspin\u2019s Chris Thompson put it, LeBron is claiming \u201cMorey is not sufficiently knowledgeable about the Qing dynasty to have feelings about Hong Kong protesters having their eyeballs shot out by cops\u201d) and generally spineless. Perhaps worst of all, he didn\u2019t do anything to discourage the increasing belief \u2014 one being lobbed at him from every rung position on the political spectrum \u2014 that he will only speak out on issues if doing so will not affect him financially. You can tell by how much cleanup he tried to do on Twitter afterward that he knew he blew it.\n\nConsidering he had a few days to figure out what he was going to say, it\u2019s surprising his statement on Morey was so sloppy and poorly considered. (Particularly because, as ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin reported, a primary reason LeBron was frustrated with Morey is because he\u2019s management, and LeBron felt any player who spoke out the way Morey did would have been fined, which Morey wasn\u2019t.) But the weird thing about all this is not that LeBron James didn\u2019t have a more coherent messaging strategy on such a hot-button issue \u2014 it\u2019s that we expected him to. LeBron has pushed his \u201cMore Than an Athlete\u201d initiative for years, and he has spoken eloquently on issues of social justice in the past, so it\u2019s reasonable to hold him to a higher standard than someone who just wants to quietly play basketball and point out inconsistencies in his approach. But it also does not make him, say, Marco Rubio. He may someday be a politician. But he is not one yet.\n\nIn many ways, this is what had LeBron so frustrated when the NBA initially stayed so quiet in the days after Morey\u2019s tweet, including the cancelation of a press conference that was supposed to involve Silver in China. As reported by The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania, when LeBron met with Silver:\n\nLeBron James spoke up in front of everyone in the room and stated he believed that Silver and the NBA needed to explain and articulate the situation first, before the players would have to, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the meeting told The Athletic. James expressed concern that without the league being able to speak to media to address all of the questions and dynamics about China and the NBA, it was unfair for solely players to bear that responsibility. \u2026 \u201cWhy are we the ones to go through the risks of speaking out in China when the league should be the first to address the matter, with our voices to follow?\u201d said one source with knowledge of the meeting and the players\u2019 thinking in regard to James\u2019 message.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this. One, that when James speaks on social issues, he\u2019s doing it out of a sense of obligation as a public-facing person and a face of the NBA; as long as he makes sure he\u2019s on the same page as the NBA, his personal beliefs, whether it\u2019s speaking out on Colin Kaepernick or calling the president a bum on Twitter (which are not official NBA positions but definitely position the NBA brand among positions the world wants to believe it holds), carry weight that Silver\u2019s wouldn\u2019t. The other, less charitable version is that LeBron wants to toe the company line before he says anything, and just wants to know what that company line is before he speaks up. (LeBron has criticized the NBA before, but on issues of basketball and union relations, not politics.) Whichever way you look at it, though, it asks LeBron James to act, essentially, like a public official, one with the same weight (or even more) than the multibillion-dollar corporation he works for. LeBron\u2019s willingness to speak his views on social justice in America certainly contrast with his lack of such willingness to speak on social justice in China. But he shares this hypocrisy with his league. It\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest that perhaps this has driven his public statements all along. When it benefits his league to speak up, he does. When it doesn\u2019t, he doesn\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s annoying \u2014 it certainly makes his calling the president a bum feel considerably less cathartic, and I\u2019m definitely gonna take the JAMES 2024 sign out of my front yard \u2014 but it\u2019s really not all that different than the rest of us. We all work for somebody, you know? The way the world works now, with this corporation taking over this corporation, and normal human workers feeling like their jobs are more precarious than ever, and the sense that any public or social-media statement you\u2019ve ever made could come back someday to ruin your life \u2026 there\u2019s all sorts of opinions that we, as regular people walking down the street, don\u2019t broadcast out of concern for our own well-being. Is this lame? Does it make us cowardly? Probably! But it\u2019s also the reality of life on this planet. Maybe LeBron loses a little bit of credibility for not speaking out on political issues in China as strongly as he does on political issues in the United States. Does this make what he has said less important? Less true? No one bothers Kawhi Leonard about his inconsistency of message, because Kawhi Leonard has never taken a political stand on anything. (Fake Facebook memes aside.) To criticize LeBron for not being stronger on China is fair. But the idea that because he stays out of that means that he should stay out of everything is bizarre \u2026 unless, of course, you just wanted him to shut up and dribble in the first place.\n\nBut LeBron has had to be the public face of his league on this as well, now taking the place as the punching bag for the NBA\u2019s cowardice on China that Adam Silver had last week. But Silver and the NBA are still the bad guys on this. They\u2019re the ones bending to China\u2019s will, the ones refusing to stand up for basic human rights in order to protect, at all costs, what makes up 15 percent of their revenue, tops. (Probably much less than that.) The NBA isn\u2019t off the hook, exactly, but we\u2019re all yelling at LeBron now rather than Silver, Houston\u2019s owner, the Nets\u2019 owner, ESPN, and all the other people who have desperately clamored for China\u2019s approval. Which is exactly what LeBron was concerned about in the first place.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
