So very happy that we\u2019re moving ahead with it,\u201d he added.\n\nPower said he felt the aeroscreen will make drivers feel so much safer that it will prolong racing careers.\n\n\u201cI can remember a couple of times in the last five years on a superspeedway, there had been a big crash \u2014 actually Scott\u2019s was one of them, and I actually went like that with my arm, not that that\u2019s going to stop anything, it\u2019s going to kill you,\u201d said the 38-year-old Australian.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s how much stuff you see flying towards your head and how lucky you really get to get through all that stuff.\n\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re on a superspeedway and there\u2019s a big crash, it\u2019s just luck really to me. It\u2019s just a matter of time until someone got caught again. So yes, having a family and all that, you probably won\u2019t think about retiring quite so soon,\u201d he said.\n\nFive-times NTT IndyCar Series champion Dixon, who tested a prototype on a simulator in July, said the aeroscreen made it a little awkward getting into the car and that drivers may want to allot more time when getting behind the wheel.\n\nBut both drivers felt the aeroscreen was seamless and New Zealander Dixon of Chip Ganassi Racing called it \u201cgood to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately it\u2019s just very quiet. I can hear my radio for a change. Normally I can\u2019t hear that. So that\u2019s kind of nice,\u201d said Dixon.\n\n\u201cBut yeah, there\u2019s actually a lot less load on the helmet, too, so visually there\u2019s been really no impairment.\u201d\n\nIndyCar has three more tests scheduled over the next five weeks and aeroscreens are to be delivered to all NTT IndyCar Series teams before the end of the year and implemented for the 2020 season.", "description": "Former Indianapolis 500 winners Scott Dixon and Will Power tested IndyCar's new cockpit protection device on Wednesday and both drivers gave the aeroscreen a thumbs up and said it was already fit for racing.", "authors": ["Frank Pingue", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
