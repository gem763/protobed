(Al Drago/Reuters)\n\nFederal judge Victor Marrero ruled on Monday that the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office could subpoena eight years of President Trump\u2019s tax returns, rejecting the president\u2019s broad defense that the Constitution effectively prohibits all criminal inquiries into sitting presidents.\n\nIn the 75-page decision, Marrero called Trump\u2019s defense \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values\u201d and denied the \u201ccategorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process.\u201d\n\nDistrict Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.\u2019s office issued a subpoena for the tax returns last week as part of an investigation into former Trump attorney Michael D. Cohen\u2019s hush-money payment to pornographer Stormy Daniels.\n\nCohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison in December 2018 for evasion and campaign-finance law violations related to the payment. While federal prosecutors have \u201ceffectively concluded\u201d their investigation into the hush-money payment, Vance\u2019s office is exploring whether the reimbursements also violated any New York laws.\n\nLast week, Justice Department lawyers asked Marrero to temporarily block the subpoena while the court examines the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s defense. According to Justice Department guidelines, federal prosecutors are barred from charging a sitting president with a crime, but the Constitution does not explicitly answer the issue, and the Supreme Court has never ruled definitively on the subject.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense team has called the actions of Vance, a Democrat, politically motivated. The subpoena is to Mazars USA, Trump\u2019s accounting firm, for federal and state tax returns for both the president and his company, dating back to 2011.\n\nThe announcement is not the first instance of controversy surrounding President Trump\u2019s tax returns. In May, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sent a letter to House Democrats rejecting a request for Trump\u2019s personal and business income tax returns. Last week, an IRS whistleblower filed a complaint over potential mismanagement by Treasury officials in the annual audit of the president and vice president\u2019s taxes.\n\nUpdate: 2:45 p.m.\n\nA federal appeals court has granted Trump a temporary stay of decision, and he will not have to turn over his tax returns to the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office.", "description": "Federal judge Victor Marrero rejected the president\u2019s broad defense that the Constitution effectively prohibits criminal inquiries into sitting presidents.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
