The lighting will be favorable when LRO passes over the site in October and once again attempts to locate and image the lander.\"\n\nIndia's first Moon mission - Chandrayaan-1 in 2008 - carried out the first and most detailed search for water on the lunar surface using radars.\n\nWhat was this mission all about?\n\nChandrayaan-2 (Moon vehicle 2) was the most complex mission ever attempted by India's space agency, Isro. \"It is the beginning of a historical journey,\" Isro chief K Sivan said after launch in July.\n\nThe lander (named Vikram, after the founder of Isro) carried within its belly a 27kg Moon rover with instruments to analyse the lunar soil.\n\nThe rover (called Pragyan - wisdom in Sanskrit) had the capacity to travel 500m from the lander in its 14-day life span, and would have sent data and images back to Earth for analysis.\n\nThe mission would have focused on the lunar surface, searching for water and minerals and measuring moonquakes, among other things.\n\nWhy would it have been significant?\n\nA soft landing on another planetary body - a feat achieved by just three other countries so far - would have been a huge technological achievement for Isro and India's space ambitions, writes science writer Pallava Bagla.\n\nHe adds that it would also have paved the way for future Indian missions to land on Mars, and opened up the possibility of India sending astronauts into space.\n\nFor the first time in India's space history, the interplanetary expedition was led by two women - project director Muthaya Vanitha and mission director Ritu Karidhal.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is India a space superpower?\n\nIt is also a matter of national pride - the satellite's lift-off in July was broadcast live on TV and Isro's official social media accounts.\n\nThe mission has also made global headlines because it's so cheap - the budget for Avengers: Endgame, for instance, was more than double at an estimated $356m. But this isn't the first time Isro has been hailed for its thrift. Its 2014 Mars mission cost $74m, a tenth of the budget for the American Maven orbiter.\n\nRead more about India's space ambitions", "description": "New pictures from a Nasa spacecraft show the targeted landing site of the Vikram rover.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C9AD/production/_108992615_mediaitem108992613.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
