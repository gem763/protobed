Following an impressive 40-25 win over the Baltimore Ravens, Mayfield wanted nothing to do with a question about Ryan.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nMayfield and Ryan have feuded throughout the week, and Mayfield was asked whether that back-and-forth with Ryan inspired the Browns to come out and have a big game. Mayfield made it clear that was not the case.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n#Browns Baker Mayfield on if Rex Ryan fueled him: \u201cAbsolutely not. Rex Ryan does not get any credit for this week\u2019s win\u201d \u2014 Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) September 29, 2019\n\nMayfield was efficient during the win. He completed 20 of 30 attempts for 342 yards and a score. He did all of that despite Odell Beckham Jr. being held in check. Beckham finished the game with just two catches for 20 yards.\n\nThe feud between Mayfield and Ryan started earlier in the week after Ryan called Mayfield \u201coverrated as hell.\u201d Mayfield responded to that by saying there is a reason Ryan isn\u2019t coaching anymore. Mayfield specifically said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t wear orange and brown, you don\u2019t matter, and Rex Ryan doesn\u2019t have any colors right now for a reason.\u201d\n\nRyan took that criticism to heart, and appeared on ESPN\u2019s pregame show wearing orange and brown.\n\nStory continues\n\nRex Ryan w/ a nod to #Browns fans this morning on ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown, wearing a brown suit + orange tie. pic.twitter.com/YP3bF7s8sm \u2014 bill hofheimer (@bhofheimer_espn) September 29, 2019\n\nWhile that was a solid way to troll by Ryan, we have to give Mayfield the win in this first fight. Mayfield may not have piled up the touchdowns Sunday, but he did more than enough to give the Browns a big win over the Ravens.\n\nPutting up 40 points alone gave Mayfield the advantage in this fight. His post-game comment made him the winner by unanimous decision.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
