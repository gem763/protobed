Suddenly I was chucked to the ground by these blokes I presumed were a gang.\n\n\u201cI was on my back with my hands over my face and took at least 10 punches to the face and body while two officers kicked my sides and stamped on my lower body.\n\n\"I was silent, in shock, but I could feel my nose and lip had popped.\n\n\u201cThen one of them turned me on to my front, at which point another stamped on my leg just above my left ankle and I knew it had broken.\n\n\u201cThe first I knew they were police was when they shoved handcuffs on me. They kept calling me by another name.\u201d\n\n(Image: Mary Browne)\n\nHe was held at a police station for 22 hours on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary before finally being released on bail.\n\nStephen says a doctor arrived two hours after he was first locked up at Uxbridge police station, but claimed he was only prescribed anti-inflammatories and was told his leg wasn\u2019t broken.\n\nTwo days later he was diagnosed with a fractured fibula.\n\nStephen, who missed his great-uncle\u2019s funeral and couldn\u2019t work for four months due to his injuries, claimed the police used unreasonable force during the incident on December 15, 2015.\n\nPolice told him in February, 2016, there would be no further action against him but he claimed they failed to apologise, so he launched a legal claim against the Met.\n\n\u201cI became very reclusive,\u201d he said. \u201cI was traumatised thinking if the police can do that and get away with it, anyone can.\u201d\n\n(Image: Mary Browne)\n\nLast June, he was diagnosed with adjustment disorder linked to the incident, after suffering depression and anxiety.\n\nThe Met said lawful force was used to carry out a lawful arrest.\n\nStephen\u2019s claim of false imprisonment was denied on the basis it was necessary to keep him in custody to verify his identity and allow effective investigation of the offence.\n\nThey settled out of court and Stephen, who lives in Waterford, Republic of Ireland, received \u00a312,000.\n\nBut he fumed: \u201cI don\u2019t think it accounts for the hell I\u2019ve endured.\u201d\n\nPolice said: \u201cThe Met confirms the civil claim has been settled out of court. We do not discuss settlement terms.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Stephen Feehan says he was taken down by plain-clothes police and punched to and kicked in a 'nightmare'", "authors": ["Amy Sharpe", "Image", "Mary Browne"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728784.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PROD-Stephen-Feehan-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
