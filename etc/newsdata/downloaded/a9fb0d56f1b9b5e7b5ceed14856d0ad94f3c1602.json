In order to have copies on hand for the book\u2019s September 10 on-sale date, booksellers were given a lengthy nondisclosure agreement to sign. Not only could they not sell the book before it officially went on sale, they couldn\u2019t read a single word in it beforehand. Critics, meanwhile, were given watermarked review copies. If anyone broke the embargo\u2014perhaps the strictest since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released over a decade ago\u2014they would be held personally liable. In an age when everything people are interested in, from albums to television shows, can be expected to leak, the book\u2019s publisher, Penguin Random House, had taken extraordinary steps to keep the book\u2019s contents under wraps.\n\nNo one, it seems, told Amazon. Over a week before the book\u2019s publication, the mega-retailer sent out a reported 800 copies of The Testaments to customers who had preordered it. Amazon shrugged it off, blaming a \u201ctechnical error\u201d and releasing a statement that should be read while imagining a corporate spokesperson barely suppressing a laugh: \u201cWe value our relationship with authors, agents, and publishers, and regret the difficulties this has caused them and our fellow booksellers.\u201d Penguin Random House followed Amazon\u2019s lead, releasing an anodyne statement that didn\u2019t even name the retailer\u2014despite being (by far) the largest publisher in the business, PRH is dwarfed by Amazon and is loathe to start a flame war with their most important account. Other booksellers, meanwhile, were apoplectic, correctly noting that they would have faced enormous consequences if they had put the book on sale early. Of course, 800 copies are a drop in the bucket to Amazon and PRH\u2014but not to independent booksellers. Some see a conspiracy at work. What better way than by leaking the most anticipated book in years is there to tell customers that Amazon\u2014and not a small business\u2014is the place to go if you want things quickly?\n\n\n\nThough Amazon is not above such stunts, it no longer needs to risk negative press to cement its brand identity. Instead, the reality is almost certainly more mundane. This wasn\u2019t a \u201ctechnical error\u201d or a vast conspiracy. It simply reflects Amazon\u2019s spectacular growth and its ever increasing market power; as the retailer has become more dominant and even less beholden to suppliers, incidental errors have increased accordingly. As it races toward one-day shipping\u2014and, it seems, adding a UPS-ish logistics company to its lengthy list of identities (retailer, tech company, film studio, etc.)\u2014the company is unleashing chaos everywhere, both on its website and on the city streets in which it operates. At the same time, Amazon now has a serious counterfeit problem and its next-day delivery program is literally killing people. Though famed for its attention to logistics, as the company increasingly dominates retail, it\u2019s choking the infrastructure and supply chains it relies on.\n\nAmazon has, over the course of its entire history, been utterly unscrupulous in pursuing growth, cheating competitors and suppliers, and flouting numerous regulations and laws in the process. But it has grown exponentially via this formula, hitting a $1 trillion market capitalization this summer. Chaos is baked into Amazon\u2019s rate of growth. To some extent, it drives it, with its CEO Jeff Bezos constantly pushing the company into new territory, often before it\u2019s prepared.
