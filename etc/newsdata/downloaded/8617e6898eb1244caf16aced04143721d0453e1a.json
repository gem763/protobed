And you're in good company: Millions of Americans fall into the category, according to a recent analysis from Construction Coverage, an industry research website.\n\nUsing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Zillow Home Price Index, the website found that close to 17 million homeowner households and 20 million renter households are considered house poor.\n\nAffluent communities aren\u2019t immune to house poverty, the analysis found. Home values have grown by 36 percent nationally, while incomes have gone up by 17 percent, and the ratio between median incomes and median home prices was the strongest predictor of house poverty.\n\nFar fewer people own homes in the areas with the highest rates of house poverty, according to the analysis.
