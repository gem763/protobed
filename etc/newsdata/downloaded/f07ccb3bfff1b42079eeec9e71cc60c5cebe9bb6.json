Tencent: Which Chinese Giant Is Worth Owning Now?", "language": "en", "text": "There's been quite a visible divergence this year between the shares of Alibaba Group Holdings (NYSE: ) and Tencent Holdings (OTC: ), China\u2019s two leading internet companies. Both have been hit by the Asian nation's economic woes, which have been squeezing consumer spending and advertising.\n\nBut Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce giant, whose stock has surged about 28% this year, is weathering this deep slowdown much better than Tencent, whose shares continue to lag, having gained just 8% so far in 2019.\n\nAlibaba's rebound follows a painful 2018 in which the stock fell 20%. Tencent lost almost a quarter of its value over the same period after China\u2019s economy hit a slow patch and the prospects of a devastating trade war with the U.S. sapped investor confidence.\n\nA deeper dive into each company's recently released earnings reports provides a more nuanced perspective regarding potential problems or bright spots for 2020.\n\nAlibaba: Earnings Momentum Remains Strong\n\nAlibaba, whose Taobao and Tmall marketplaces connect merchants with Chinese consumers, showed in its that the strength of its platform remains intact despite the slowing Chinese economy and disturbances on the macro front. Last month, it reported revenue and profit numbers that easily beat analyst estimates. Revenue soared 42%, while net income more than doubled.\n\nBABA Weekly TTM\n\nWhat insulated China's Amazon (NASDAQ: ) equivalent from the effects of the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war was a massive consumer shift to internet shopping, coupled with sales promotions across the country. Growth in its cloud computing division, which commands half the country\u2019s market share, expanded 66%.\n\nGoing forward, Alibaba has a much better chance to grow and diversify. The company has invested heavily to expand in the cloud computing business, by opening new data centers in Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia and in the domestic Chinese market.\n\nIn a recent interview with Business Week, Alibaba\u2019s new chairman Daniel Zhang said Alibaba is uniquely positioned to pull together the online and offline worlds in groceries and beyond. Indeed, dozens of his new initiatives are leading Alibaba deeper into new arenas including finance, health care, movies and music.\n\nTencent: Gaming Division Facing Regulatory Hurdles\n\nTencent, sometimes referred to as China's Facebook (NASDAQ: ), continues struggling to recover from the slowdown it experienced last year. That's because, in 2018, the Shenzhen-based internet services company's lucrative gaming business was hit by Chinese government controls. In addition, the macro environment in which it operates worsened with companies markedly slowing their spending, hurting Tencent's advertising business.\n\nTencent Weekly TTM\n\nUnfortunately, many macro factors that would support the company's recovery are still absent.\n\nThe latest evidence of this lingering weakness came when the company reported its last month. Online ad revenue grew at a worse-than-expected 16%.\n\nWhile sales of social media ads and \u201cothers\u201d jumped 28%, media ad revenue fell 7% because of unexpected delays in the airing of certain drama series.\n\nAnd though regulators are again allowing new games to be released after last year\u2019s freeze\u2014including Tencent\u2019s 2019 breakout hit, Peacekeeper Elite\u2014they\u2019re doing so at a slower pace. That hurdle is slowing the revival of the gaming business which brings in more than 40% of Tencent's total revenue.\n\n\u201cOur assumption is that the macro environment will remain difficult for the rest of the year,\u201d Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell told analysts on a conference call as cited by Bloomberg. \u201cThe situation of the heavy supply of advertising inventory will continue for the rest of the year, and potentially into the next year,\u201d he said, adding this could affect revenue from the automobile, real estate and financial services sectors.\n\nAnalysts say Tencent can still muster growth in the second half, on the back of its highly popular title, Peacekeeper Elite as well as older, durable titles such as Honour of Kings. It released 10 games in the second quarter.\n\nIn addition to its gaming division, analysts will also be zeroing in on Tencent's efforts to diversify its revenue base by bringing in more sales from its WeChat Pay service, cloud computing and wealth management.\n\nThe unit that includes these businesses saw 37% growth in the quarter. Its Licaitong wealth management platform, which competes with Alibaba-owned rival Ant Financial, accumulated 800 billion of customer assets by the end of June.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWithout doubt, Alibaba, whose stock closed yesterday at $171.55, has proven to be a better bet in 2019 for any investors who already have shares in their portfolios. The company\u2019s e-commerce strength and local exposure, in our view, will keep it insulated from a variety of macro risks that other players are facing.\n\nStill, we also like Tencent and find its current weakness, the stock closed at $42.270 yesterday, an opportunity to accumulate. The company's gaming pipeline is strong and well on track to broaden its revenue base. As well, Tencent's business model is proving to be much more durable versus many of its western peers.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Haris Anwar/Investing.com covering: USD/CNY, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Tencent Holdings Ltd ADR.
