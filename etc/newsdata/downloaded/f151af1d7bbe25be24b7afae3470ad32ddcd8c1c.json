But she didn't confront him until learning that he had also made female crew members uncomfortable with his persistent flirting. During their showdown at the cocktail party, Angie told Jess: 'You made me feel very uncomfortable at the photo shoot. I said I wanted fun, but I feel like you took it too far. 'I will never allow a man to come in and f**k with my sisterhood. Never. 'I feel like you think this is a joke, and that really annoys me. You never talk about me as a person. You always just talk about me as a piece of meat.' As Jess interrupted to apologise for 'acting inappropriately', Angie snapped: 'I really don't believe a word that you say. 'I don't trust you and I'm sorry, you're gonna have to leave.' Dumped: Jess was sent home on Thursday's episode of The Bachelorette, after Angie Kent (pictured) confronted him over his inappropriate behaviour After packing his bags and being driven away in the limousine, Jess denied any wrongdoing. 'Apparently I was a bit crude to her on the photo shoot. That's bulls**t,' he said. 'Apparently that was too sexualising. I don't know. Obviously, it's just a different of opinion. I know deep down nothing happened.' He then added: 'I'm going back to Noosa to find the love of my life in a dirty, dingy nightclub.'\n\nLater in the episode, he called Angie a 'b***h' after being told she wanted to speak to him about his inappropriate behaviour on set.\n\nHe was eventually sent packing, but told producers on the limousine ride home that his journey to finding love was far from over.\n\n'I'm going back to Noosa to find the love of my life in a dirty, dingy nightclub,' he said.\n\nAs he continues to face a backlash for his portrayal on the show, Jess told Daily Mail Australia that his one supporter is his new girlfriend, Mandy Lopez.\n\n'I wouldn't be surprised if she left me.

It's not the kind of attention you want. If I were her, I would leave me,' he added.\n\nWhen asked why an up-and-coming politician would appear on a dating show, Jess said he saw it as an opportunity to find a partner.\n\n'I'm pretty time poor so I decided to go on TV and went into the experience with an open heart,' he said.\n\n'I kind of wanted to show my good side, but the worst side of me was shown. I've never seen that side of me before.'\n\nAngie: 'Why Jess shouldn't be fired' Speaking on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Friday, Angie said that Jess shouldn't lose his job over the scandal. 'I'm not asking him to lose his job, I just stuck up for myself and other women he was making uncomfortable,' she said. 'When I heard he made other women feel uncomfortable, that's when I saw red.
