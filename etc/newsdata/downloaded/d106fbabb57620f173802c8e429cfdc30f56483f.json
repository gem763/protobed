Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican. She told MarketWatch that the original picture posted by Daily Beast reporter Sam Brodey caught her while she was looking for her boss, as House Minority Whip Steve Scalise had summoned him.\n\n\u201cYes, that is me,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cYou know, on top of all the press conferences, and making sure Mr. Jordan gets to the floor, and going viral on the internet, it\u2019s just a regular day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the attention,\u201d she added, \u201cbut at least I looked OK.\u201d\n\nThat image has been retweeted more than 1,400 times, with many readers claiming to identify with Huddleston, who appears to be staring up into space as if she has lost patience with the political chaos below her.\n\nMatt Gaetz says he\u2019s about to lead this phalanx of House Republicans into the SCIF to check out what\u2019s going on with the whole impeachment thing pic.twitter.com/iFyxqMgcsr \u2014 Sam Brodey (@sambrodey) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cThe woman in blue: \u2018Lord, beer me strength,\u2019 \u201d joked Buzzfeed News D.C. editor Sarah Mimms.\n\n\u201cShe is all of us,\u201d added a Twitter TWTR, -0.81% user under the name Jessica Johnson.\n\nThe woman in blue above them in the light is everything about this picture... pic.twitter.com/apj5bFOM4U \u2014 Jon Virtes (@JonVirtes) October 23, 2019\n\nKudos to the woman in blue finding that Instaworthy lighting. https://t.co/D1UsjtNRAW \u2014 Maggie Seymour (@maggie_mae_mour) October 23, 2019\n\nMany users mused that she appeared to be ascending to an otherworldly plane.\n\nMeanwhile that woman in blue is about to get swept up in the Rapture and no one even notices https://t.co/XSZr57o5nL \u2014 Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older (@djolder) October 23, 2019\n\nThe news here is the woman in blue getting accepted into heaven. \u2014 Jeremy Duncan (@TheJeremyDuncan) October 23, 2019\n\nBut, in fact, her boss was a part of the political demonstration, which Huddleston would not describe to MarketWatch as a protest, nor did she agree with the assessment that barging into a secured space qualified as chaos. \u201cIt was not chaotic; it was organized,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what occurred at SCIF is not about me. I\u2019m just a nobody; a Congressional staffer.\u201d\n\nRead more: Republicans barge into SCIF and sideline deposition of Pentagon\u2019s Laura Cooper\n\nHuddleston discovered she was becoming a somebody online after a friend DM\u2019d her Brodey\u2019s viral post. \u201cSam Brodey just has a way with the camera, I guess, and he made me look good,\u201d she said.\n\nThe little blue dress is something she paid $30 for at Nordstrom Rack, she reported. \u201cIt was the one that was clean,\u201d she said of why she was wearing it Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I brushed my hair this morning ... used some dry shampoo, parted it on the side. It\u2019s been so crazy.\u201d\n\nBut she made the image her banner photo on her Twitter profile because her friends were hounding her to do so. \u201cThey think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be a viral meme on the internet. I hope this all goes away soon.\u201d", "description": "The mystery woman is confirmed to be Charli Huddleston, spokeswoman for Rep.
