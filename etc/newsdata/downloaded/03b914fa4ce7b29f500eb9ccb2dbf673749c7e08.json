I've used a few clothing subscription box services, but so far, I've liked Amazon Prime Wardrobe the most.\n\nYou choose between two and eight items available via Prime Wardrobe, try them on for seven days, send back what you don't want, and just pay for the items you decide to keep.\n\nThough you need an Amazon Prime membership to access Prime Wardrobe (currently $119 or less for students and EBT/Medicaid cardholders), you can get a 30-day free trial and enjoy a long list of other benefits.\n\nI suffer from a common but made-up condition called \"shopper's eyes\" \u2014 my eyes to glaze over whenever I'm in a retail store for more than 10 minutes.\n\nThis makes shopping for clothes and shoes difficult because I lose all interest in the task at hand and my only goal is to get out. I don't have the patience to try on clothes in a cramped, uncomfortable fitting room so more often than not, I come up empty on my shopping trips.\n\nInstead, I shop online and have even tried several clothing subscription boxes, but they tend to be expensive, limited in their selection, and sent on a regular cadence that doesn't always match when I want or need the items.\n\nAmazon Prime Wardrobe fixes these problems. I love this service because you can choose the exact clothes, shoes, and accessories you want from a massive and affordable selection instead of indicating a certain style or preference and getting surprised with each box.\n\nPrime Wardrobe is free for Amazon Prime Members; choose up to eight pieces of clothes and accessories, and only pay for the items you keep\n\nPrime Wardrobe is currently only available for Amazon Prime members. If you aren't a Prime member yet, I strongly recommend giving it a try. Here are 31 reasons why.\n\nUsing Prime Wardrobe is simple.\n\nFirst, you choose up to eight pieces of clothes, shoes, jewelry, or accessories you want to try within the Prime Wardrobe service \u2014 not everything that's available to purchase via Prime is available on Prime Wardrobe. When you find an item you like, just add it to your Prime Wardrobe cart.\n\nI had eight items in my first Prime Wardrobe shipment including a blazer and shoes, and it took about six days to arrive. Amazon gives you seven days to try the items on and decide what you want to keep. During that time, they send you email reminders so you don't forget. And be sure to hold onto the packaging in which your items came \u2014 you'll use it to return the stuff you don't want to keep.\n\nI waited five days before finally putting on a fashion show for my wife and her friend. Based on my initial impressions and their feedback, I decided to keep four of the pieces. I went to my Amazon Orders page to indicate what I want to keep and return, paid for what I wanted, and sent the rest back.\n\nI accidentally threw away one of the packages I was supposed to use to return the items I didn't want. Fortunately, everything fit into one package. Like I mentioned, keep the original packaging.\n\nI prefer Prime Wardrobe over other clothing subscription boxes because I can shop online, choose exactly what I want to try on, and pay for only what I keep\n\nWhat I like most about Prime Wardrobe is that it takes the stressful retail store and fitting room experiences out of the equation.\n\nI can shop online, try on clothes in the comfort of my own home, and only pay for items if I decide to keep them. I don't have to make an assessment of how things fit in a high-pressure atmosphere with weird lighting and deceptive mirrors. And I don't have sales associates hovering over me \u2014 just my wife (and sometimes, her friend).\n\nThe service also has clothes, shoes, and accessories from a broad range of brands like Calvin Klein, Levi's Hugo Boss, Champion, Adidas, Goodthreads, Buttoned Down, and even Amazon Essentials. In my first order, I tried clothes from Wrangler, Dockers, Columbia, and Volcom.\n\nPrime Wardrobe is also ideal for people who might not know what sizes to buy. You can choose a few sizes of an item and return the ones that don't fit.\n\nOne of the big differences between Prime Wardrobe and just buying things on Amazon Prime directly is that you're not paying for things upfront. With Prime Wardrobe, you don't pay anything until you've decided you want to keep the clothes, but with regular Amazon orders, you pay for the item and then get a refund if you return it.\n\nNot everything available on Prime is on Prime Wardrobe, but there's still a massive selection of clothes, shoes, and accessories\n\nThe most frustrating part of my experience was that a lot of the items I wanted to try were not Prime Wardrobe eligible.\n\nThere's a large selection on Prime Wardrobe, so you'll likely need to filter your search. But if there's just one style or size available in something you're looking for, then it'll still come up in the results \u2014 even if you specify your size. For instance, even if I specify that I'm looking for a size 15 shoe, I'll get results that are only available in size 9.\n\nIn my first shipment, I had a blazer and a pair of shoes that weren't the best fit \u2014 the shoes were a little too big and the blazer was a little too small. There wasn't a bigger size of the blazer available when I tried to order a different size so I gave up on that, but was able to order a smaller pair of shoes, which ended up fitting perfectly. I'm hoping that as the service matures, there'll be a wider selection of items and sizes available, and a better search filter.\n\nYou'll also need a credit card on file with Amazon if you want to try Prime Wardrobe. A debit card won't do. And if you decide to keep the clothes, you're required to pay with a credit card too. I generally try to avoid using my credit card so this was annoying.\n\nI'd still recommend Prime Wardrobe to shoppers like me, but would like to see more styles and sizes available\n\nOverall, I'm a big fan of Amazon Prime Wardrobe. I plan on using it again the next time I need more options in my closet, and I'll continue to recommend it to friends and family.\n\nI was a little disappointed that more styles and sizes weren't available, but the selection still beats what's available through clothing subscription services. Plus you don't have to commit to anything or pay for items upfront.\n\nI strongly recommend trying Prime Wardrobe the next time you want to shop online.\n\nPros: You don't pay for items unless you decide to keep them, service has a wide selection of clothes and accessories, have one week to try on clothes, free shipping and returns\n\nCons: Must be a Prime member, items are not available in all sizes and styles, have to pay with a credit card", "description": "Amazon Prime Wardrobe comes free with your Amazon Prime membership and lets you try on clothes and shoes before you buy them.
