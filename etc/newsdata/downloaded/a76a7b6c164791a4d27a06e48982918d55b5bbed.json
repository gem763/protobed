Troops are consolidating their positions to prepare to fly out of the country soon.\n\nThe official says U.S. troops based in Iraq could conduct cross-border operations against the Islamic State group in Syria as they did before creating the now-abandoned partnership with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nA Turkish youth celebrates with a national flag after news about Syrian town of Tal Abyad, in Turkish border town of Akcakale, in Sanliurfa province, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019.

Other sanctions include raising steel tariffs back up to 50% and actions against three senior Turkish officials and Turkey's defense and energy ministries.\n\nThe U.S. is calling on Turkey to stop its invasion of Syria and declare a cease-fire in the assault that began after Trump announced he was moving U.S. troops out of the way.\n\nTrump is sending Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser Robert O'Brien to Ankara as soon as possible in an attempt to begin negotiations with Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nIn this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, Syrian troops deploy in the northern town of Tal Tamr, Monday, Oct 14, 2019.
