Warren has vowed to break up giant tech companies like Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.\n\nHe also said breaking up big tech companies would make election interference \u201cmore likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together\u201d and drew laughter by saying Facebook\u2019s investment on safety was bigger than Twitter\u2019s entire revenue.\n\nWITHOUT ABSOLUTE CONTROL, \u2018I WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED\u2019\n\nAsked how he balanced his financial responsibility to shareholders with his moral responsibility to society, Zuckerberg reminded employees of moments when he believes his concentrated control helped Facebook ride out difficulties such as Yahoo\u2019s 2006 bid for the company.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve been lucky about in building this company is, you know, I kind of have voting control of the company, and that\u2019s something I focused on early on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd it was important because, without that, there were several points where I would\u2019ve been fired. For sure, for sure\u2026\u201d\n\nFACEBOOK HAS A \u2018PLAN OF ATTACK\u2019 AGAINST TIKTOK\n\nZuckerberg was also questioned about Facebook\u2019s \u2018plan of attack\u2019 against TikTok, the rapidly growing video app owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, which has gained huge popularity among teenagers.\n\nHe said that Facebook was focusing its new standalone video-sharing app Lasso, but would test it first in markets where TikTok is less prominent, such as Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to first see if we can get it to work in countries where TikTok is not already big before we go and compete with TikTok in countries where they are big,\u201d he said.\n\nWHY FACEBOOK ANNOUNCED DIGITAL CURRENCY PLANS EARLY\n\nZuckerberg touched on the company\u2019s ambitious plans to establish a cryptocurrency called Libra. Announced in June, the project quickly ran into trouble with skeptical regulators around the world.\n\nZuckerberg said these responses had been part of Facebook trying \u201ca more consultative approach\u201d on big projects.\n\n\u201cSo not just show up and say, \u2018Alright, here we\u2019re launching this. Here\u2019s a product, your app got updated, now you can start buying Libras and sending them around,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nFACEBOOK DOES NOT WANT TO GET INTO BRAIN SURGERY\n\nFacebook announced last month that it had bought New York-based CTRL-labs, a start-up that is exploring ways for people to communicate with computers using brain signals.\n\nIn the transcripts from the earlier July meetings, Zuckerberg said he thought that as part of Facebook\u2019s work on artificial reality and virtual reality, there would be a small amount of \u201cdirect brain\u201d interface and that progress in this area was exciting.\n\nBut he stressed that Facebook was focused on non-invasive approaches that do not require surgery or implants.\n\n\u201cYou think Libra is hard to launch,\u201d Zuckerberg joked, imagining the headline \u201c\u2018Facebook wants to perform brain surgery.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to see the congressional hearings on that one.\u201d\n\nCONTENT MODERATOR REPORTS: \u201cA LITTLE OVERDRAMATIC\u201d\n\nOutside contractors who monitor Facebook for objectionable content have complained that their work was underpaid, stressful and sometimes traumatic. An employee asked Zuckerberg about Facebook\u2019s plan to protect these types of contractors.\n\nZuckerberg said it was an \u201cimportant issue that we\u2019re focused on\u201d but he also said some of the reports were \u201ca little overdramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin a population of 30,000 people, there\u2019s going to be a distribution of experiences that people have,\u201d he said.\n\nChief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer also stepped in to say that the company was working on technology to minimize harms for human moderators, for example, by automatically catching duplicate content.", "description": "Leaked audio of Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg addressing questions from staff in two internal July meetings was published on Tuesday by The Verge.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
