(Bastiaan Slabbers/Reuters)\n\nBefore President Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to \u201clook into\u201d Joe Biden, he had turned ridiculing the former vice president into something of a presidential pastime.\n\nHe attacked Biden at the White House and at campaign rallies. He attacked Biden on Twitter and on Instagram. He attacked Biden in France and in Japan, during news conferences and official speeches, in phone calls and interviews, on Air Force One and in the Rose Garden, during morning \u201cexecutive time\u201d and in late-night tweetstorms.\n\nThe president\u2019s fixation on Biden is now at the heart of a historic impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats, who accuse Trump of using the power and leverage of the U.S. government to pressure Ukraine into investigating his potential rival.\n\nIn a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump seemed to push for Ukraine\u2019s government to develop evidence against Biden and his son, Hunter, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House on Wednesday. Trump said during the call that he would get U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr to work with the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens, which set off a whistleblower complaint and a series of events that could culminate in an impeachment trial.\n\nThe reinvigorated impeachment push this week is already leading the president to further focus on Biden, as Trump and his supporters seek to shift attention from potential White House misconduct to whether the former vice president abused his position to help Hunter when he served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company during the Obama administration, charges that have little grounding in fact.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he was willing the release the whistleblower complaint against him so long as information was also released about Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and China.\n\n\u201c[I] also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at the United Nations without offering any evidence to back up this charge. \u201cMillions of dollars. Millions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly while he was vice president. I think they should have transparency for that.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states.\n\nCampaign aides previously had been wary of singling out any of the Democratic presidential candidates, instead opting to lump the group of more than 20 contenders together under the banner of \u201csocialism.\u201d\n\nThat began to change early this summer, as Trump\u2019s focus on Biden hardened and the president began hitting the former vice president more often and more energetically than any other candidate. Trump\u2019s attacks intensified as internal and public polling showed Biden as the president\u2019s most competitive challenger, with large leads in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile several top Democratic candidates have avoided Trump in an attempt to focus on their own visions for the country, Biden has framed his campaign as a wholesale rebuttal to Trump from the very start.\n\nBiden has also targeted areas of the country where Trump won in 2016, and has made a centerpiece of his campaign proving to Democrats that he could win back states in the Upper Midwest.\n\n\u201cFor someone who claims to be a \u2018dealmaker,\u2019 Donald Trump has certainly given Joe Biden a lot of rent-free real estate in his own head,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, listing areas where Trump has fixated on Biden, including \u201can unprecedented crisis by pressuring a foreign country to foment a universally-debunked conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nWhen Biden formally joined the race in April \u2014 launched with a criticism of Trump\u2019s response to the racist violence in Charlottesville \u2014 Trump greeted him with a tweet.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt will be nasty \u2014 you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick & demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!\u201d\n\nIn the months since, Trump has widened his attacks on Biden, criticizing him over China, trade, Iran, North Korea, his work with segregationists, his support for the 1994 crime bill and his mental acuity.\n\nThe attacks intensified after internal polling data that leaked from Trump\u2019s campaign showed Biden ahead of Trump by significant margins in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida.\n\nCampaign officials confirmed the data but said the numbers were already outdated by the time they leaked in June.\n\nTrump dismissed the polls as \u201cfake,\u201d but his focus on Biden persisted.\n\nWhite House officials have also increasingly found ways to criticize Biden, sometimes bringing up the former vice president unprompted to contrast his record to Trump\u2019s.\n\nLast week, Trump\u2019s campaign released a video that strung together clips of Biden\u2019s verbal gaffes and television pundits \u2014 as well as campaign rival Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) \u2014 questioning his age and mental abilities.\n\n\u201cYou just wonder\u2026,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said on Twitter as he posted the video clip. While some Republican strategists have warned that focusing so much on Biden this early in the campaign would only elevate him in a crowded field, Trump has followed his instincts to meddle in the Democratic primary and seek to wound the leading candidates.\n\nSome Trump aides said the president hits Biden because the former vice president is a visible force and an easy target.\n\n\u201cBiden is the front-runner and with his 40 plus years in politics, there\u2019s a lot of material,\u201d said Kelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC.\n\nBiden\u2019s penchant for gaffes and his previous failed attempts at running for president also make him a ripe target for Trump, said Bryan Lanza, an adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and transition efforts.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s an easy punching bag in presidential politics because he\u2019s a three-time loser,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a long record. He was in office when the deterioration of the middle class began.\u201d\n\nThe attempt to cast Biden as the ultimate insider within a corrupt system has continued as Trump has pushed for investigations into Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nThe president has sought to use the same playbook that he successfully employed in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, who Trump portrayed as a corrupt self-dealer who represented a broken Washington.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Parscale make the link explicit, accusing \u201cthe Bidens, the Clintons, and other career politicians\u201d of abusing their power.\n\nJust weeks after Biden officially entered the race, Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani was making attempts to contact top officials in the Ukrainian government to discuss investigating Biden. Giuliani had begun making the case publicly and to Trump that Biden had been involved in a corrupt scheme to help his son by forcing out a Ukrainian prosecutor in 2016. Trump has since sought to broadcast those charges to the wider public.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nIn the past, Biden\u2019s campaign has relished the fights with Trump, on the belief that it elevates him over the rest of the Democratic field to showcase what a general election would look like.\n\n\u201cI understand the president\u2019s been tweeting a lot about me this morning. I wonder why the hell he\u2019s doing that,\u201d Biden said during his first trip to Iowa, practically giddy. \u201cYo yo, woah woah woah. Anyway. I\u2019m going to be the object of his attention for a while, folks.\u201d\n\nBiden for much of his career has been seen as a politician with strong bipartisan relationships, the one who was asked to eulogize his Republican colleagues at their funerals, the one who attempted to see the good in his political opponents. He has come under criticism from Democrats for failing to adjust to the more combative partisan warfare.\n\nBut now the full apparatus of the Republican Party is crashing down on him, attempting to reshape his reputation in the eyes of a country that Biden\u2019s campaign believes already knows him and likes him.\n\nWhile Trump and his allies over the past few months have cast him as a bumbling and stumbling old man \u2014 calling him \u201ca dummy\u201d or \u201cthe weakest mentally\u201d \u2014 they are now trying to make Biden into a corrupt figure who can\u2019t control his own son.\n\nBiden has been less personal in his characterizations of Trump, but has pointed to him as a historically bad figure who is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to everything America has stood for.\n\nHe grew more animated this week, saying Trump was asking a foreign government to investigate him because, \u201che knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an affront to every single American and the founding values of our country,\u201d Biden said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThis is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a national security issue. It is a test of our democratic values.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s focus on Biden is now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats, who accuse Trump of using the power and leverage of the U.S. government to pressure Ukraine into investigating his potential rival.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y-OhnkRKbrYgHBUhVq7LAlf3J1g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZYHJDXG7CII6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
