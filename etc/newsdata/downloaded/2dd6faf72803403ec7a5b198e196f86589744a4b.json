He is out on a $500,000 bond and must wear a GPS monitoring device\n\nHis lawyer also said that the law as applied to the evidence tampering charge was 'unconstitutional.'\n\nHe went on to say that Fotis couldn't have tampered with the evidence because prior to his alleged actions on the night of May 24, there had been 'no investigation instituted and no proceedings, which were in the offing,' according to the Stamford Advocate.\n\nVideo evidence from the night of May 24 is said to show two people resembling Fotis and Troconis in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nThe footage also showed a man who looked like Fotis throwing out garbage bags in more than 30 trash cans along a four-mile stretch of road. The bags were later found to have contained Jennifer's blood and clothes, according to arrest warrants.\n\nThere was also said to be footage of a pickup truck belonging to a former employee of Fotis' company in New Canaan the morning that Jennifer disappeared.\n\nArrest warrants also said that the former employee later told police that Fotis had pressured him into taking out the seats in the truck, which were later found to have Jennifer's blood on them. The employee also said that Fotis had taken the truck in to be washed and detailed without telling him.\n\nFotis' girlfriend, Michelle Troconis (right), also appeared in court Friday, seeking a jury trial. She is due back in court on October 25\n\nTroconis (in court Friday) is out on a $500,000 bond and must wear a GPS monitoring device\n\nJennifer Dulos (left) and Fotis Dulos (right) were said to be in the middle of a contentious divorce and child custody case when she disappeared\n\nJennifer, a mother of five, was last seen on May 24 after dropping off her children at school\n\nFotis Dulos (right) and Michelle Troconis (left) pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution\n\nJennifer's body has not yet been located, but police suspect she suffered a serious assault in her home. FBI evidence teams are seen here searching a park near Jennifer's home\n\nThe judge said that he needed time to review Fotis' lawyer's arguments and did not make a ruling Friday morning. Instead, the judge said he would revisit the issue during Fotis' November 6 hearing.\n\nWhile Fotis was in front of him, the judge took the opportunity to remind Fotis of the gag order that had been placed on him.\n\nA gag order was imposed on him by a judge on September 12, barring him and his attorneys from speaking about Jennifer in a way that would taint a jury's opinion about her or the case.\n\nBut, on September 27, a Greek news website called Proto Thema, published a long interview with Fotis in which he made claims that Jennifer 'had 'serious psychological problems' and lived like a 'hermit.' He also claimed that he had asked for a divorce in 2016 and 2018, although there is paperwork showing that Jennifer had filed for divorce in 2017.\n\nThe judge said that Fotis' interview with Proto Thema was a violation of the gag order, gave him a warning and told him that the gag order was in effect until a court ruled otherwise.\n\nFotis' girlfriend, Troconis, also made an appearance in court Friday.\n\nShe pleaded not guilty to the tampering with evidence charge and her attorney asked for a jury trial. She is expected to return to court on October 25.\n\nBoth Fotis and Troconis are out on $500,000 bonds each, while wearing GPS monitoring devices.\n\nJennifer and Fotis were in the middle of a contentious divorce and child custody case. She was last seen the morning of May 24, when she dropped off her and Fotis' children at their school.\n\nPolice who went to her New Canaan home after she was reported missing found blood spatter in the garage. Jennifer's body has not yet been located, but police suspect she suffered a serious assault in her home.\n\nThe estranged couple's children are currently being taken care of by Jennifer's mother, who is seeking custody of them.\n\nAnyone with information on Jennifer's disappearance can call the New Canaan Police Tip Line at (203) 594-3544.", "description": "Fotis Dulos (right) and girlfriend, Michelle Troconis (left were in a Connecticut court Friday for hearings about related to the disappearance of Fotis' wife, Jennifer Dulos (inset with Fotis).", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Maxine Shen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/06/19324362-0-image-a-81_1570253798048.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
