Beneath a sweltering sun, she goes from one car to the next, peering intently at the backseat passengers as she asks for spare change. She approaches a black car with a family of five inside.\n\nAs the father reaches for change, Gulnaz quickly scans the faces of the three children in the back. To buy time, she makes small talk, but the man passes her a few rupees and hastily rolls up the car window.\n\n\u201cThey think we\u2019re freaks,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201cThat we steal children because we can\u2019t have our own. But here we are, doing the exact opposite.\u201d Gulnaz pulls out a crumpled photo from her purse and sighs; the missing child she has spent all afternoon searching for \u2013 13-year-old Asma Razzak \u2013 is nowhere to be found.\n\nGulnaz is one of Pakistan\u2019s estimated 500,000 transgender people, who are largely shunned and driven to the dangerous margins of Karachi life. Many end up working in vulnerable industries such as the sex trade.\n\nGulnaz is also on the frontline of Pakistan\u2019s battle to overcome an epidemic of child disappearances linked to slavery, exploitation and murder.\n\nAccording to NGO Sahil, in a survey of 85 national and regional newspapers, 1,064 child abduction cases were reported, of which 79% were girls and 21% boys. This is part of a wider story of children going missing across Pakistan; exploited, abused, sold into forced marriage or slavery. In its latest report, Sahil found the main reasons for abduction were trafficking, begging, sex work and bonded labour in brick kilns.\n\nFor years this issue has been largely ignored, but in recent weeks the desperate tale of Pakistan\u2019s missing children has become a national scandal. The discovery of four children\u2019s bodies in shallow graves and on rubbish dumps in the Kasur district of Punjab, south of Lahore, in September sparked demonstrations over police inaction. Cars were burned and the local police station was pelted with stones. The prime minister, Imran Khan, stepped in, promising that the police would be held to account, and unveiling an app to track children from the moment they vanish.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Activists hold a vigil for Zainab Ansari, seven, who was raped and murdered in Kasur, Punjab, in 2018.

In January 2018 seven-year-old Zainab Ansari went missing while walking the short distance from her house to Qur\u2019an school.\n\nFour days later, after her family tracked down CCTV footage, reportedly with little help from the police, her body was found on a rubbish dump. She had been raped and strangled. Her disappearance was the latest in a long line of local children to go missing. Imran Ali, 24, was convicted of Zainab\u2019s killing, and police investigators also matched his DNA with seven other girls\u2019 bodies.\n\nIn Karachi, a low-tech revolution, led by society\u2019s outcasts, is leading where police have failed.\n\nGulnaz is part of a team put together by human rights activist Muhammad Ali. In 2007, Ali founded Roshni Helpline, Pakistan\u2019s first hotline for missing children, which uses a complex system of volunteer informants. This includes transgender sex workers, neighbours, blacksmiths, street vendors and all those aware of who is coming and going through the underground routes of trafficking. Together, they claim to have helped locate more than 5,000 of Karachi\u2019s missing children and reunited them with their families.\n\nLiving on the margins gives Gulnaz a strong empathy with the families who are losing children. \u201cThey usually belong to poorer families, so the police don\u2019t take their cases seriously,\u201d she says. \u201cSecurity is a luxury not everyone here can afford.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Muhammad Ali, founder of Roshni Helpline, in his office. Photograph: Mohammad Ali Addarsh/The Guardian\n\nSitting on a swivel chair behind a mahogany desk stacked with case files of missing children, Ali says the reasons for abductions vary.\n\n\u201cNewborns until the age of three are mainly kidnapped for false adoption while children between three and 10 are more vulnerable to sexual exploitation, [forced begging] and ransom. From 10 onwards, we also find runaway cases due to domestic abuse or the threat of child marriage.\u201d\n\nThe walls of his small office are plastered with cut-out clippings of missing children \u2013 small, black-and-white printed faces stare back, frozen in time. Mursaleen Khizer, six, missing since 26 August 2017. Aisha Zafar, 12, missing since 1 September 2018. Tahir Khan, 16, missing since 6 March 2019 \u2013 the list is long. Missing children ads are as regular as crossword puzzles in Urdu newspapers.\n\n\u201cThe idea to involve transgender [people] came because they have good connections in the city,\u201d says Ali. It was the ability of the khawaja sira \u2013 as trans people are commonly known \u2013 to move through the margins of society, dangerous places that traditional authorities have no access to, that led him to approach them. \u201cIt seemed obvious,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would be able to help us.\u201d\n\nTypically cast out by their families, Pakistan\u2019s transgender community knows all too well what estrangement feels like. \u201cWe\u2019ve also been abandoned,\u201d Gulnaz laments. \u201cWe understand the pain of separation so reuniting these children with their families makes us feel good for a while.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zubaida Shaheen holds up a photo of her daughter, Mursaleen Khizer, six, who has been missing for two years. Photograph: Mohammad Ali Addarsh/The Guardian\n\nGulnaz moved to Karachi at the age of 15 after being disowned by her family. \u201cI came here to find a job, but found only one difficulty after another.\u201d To survive, she juggles her time between begging and dancing. \u201cI take work wherever I can find it,\u201d she explains.\n\nOn a warm afternoon, Ali and his team gather around for their weekly meeting. Shehla Khan*, 40, has been working with Roshni for the past four years and manages a group of 50 other transgender volunteers. Today they are being briefed by the case management team on children who have recently gone missing in the area. The volunteers listen intently as they are equipped with photos and information about each child.\n\nAli\u2019s team carefully maps out an area where a child has gone missing. Colour-coded drawing pins determine key entryways and exits to ensure they are carefully watched. Volunteers are told to scout vulnerable areas such as Mobina Town, Gulshan-e-Iqbal and Jamshed Town, where they must remain particularly vigilant.\n\nOnce ostracised, now Pakistani transgender people are running for parliament Read more\n\n\u201cI was recently tipped off on the whereabouts of a kidnapped girl, who was being exploited at an unknown house,\u201d says Khan. \u201cI immediately informed Roshni, who, together with the police, were able to track down the location. After carrying out a raid, they not only found the girl but three others who were being kept in the basement.\u201d\n\nShehla is also a guru, a guardian of younger transgender women, many of whom come to her after being abandoned by their families. Shunned by mainstream society, Pakistan\u2019s transgender community is often subjected to violence and hostility. In the past three years, 58 have been murdered in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province alone.\n\nAli\u2019s persistence has taken his fight all the way to Pakistan\u2019s supreme court, where he is now pushing for a law that would ensure the police act promptly when a child goes missing. \u201cEven 24 hours is too long to wait,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has to be the moment a child goes missing.\u201d\n\nLater that evening Gulnaz is back on the road. Asma Razzak has yet to be found, and Gulnaz isn\u2019t giving up. The call to prayer rings out from a minaret and worshippers start to descend on a nearby mosque. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to get overlooked in this big city. But one glance is all it takes,\u201d Gulnaz says determinedly. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the right place at the right time, a glance can save someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n*Names changed to protect identities", "description": "On Karachi\u2019s streets, a team is leading the way where police have failed in investigating disappearances", "authors": ["Thaslima Begum In Karachi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec46214725f53e007ec47b909b55b9dd6aba846/0_389_5494_3296/master/5494.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=887c4f82f595a45fd9cf52d7a49681e0", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
