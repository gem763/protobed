The Dealmaster is back with another round of deals to share. Today's list is headlined by a nice price on Microsoft's Xbox One wireless controller, which is down to $40 at various retailers, including Walmart, Best Buy, and Amazon. While this is not the lowest price we've seen\u2014and while we can't say it won't drop a few bucks further by Black Friday\u2014it's still $20 off the gamepad's MSRP and $10-15 off its usual going rate online.\n\nOne reason we highlight this deal is the recent launch of Apple's iOS 13 update , which added support for the Xbox One pad as well as Sony's DualShock 4 controller over Bluetooth (alongside a raft of new worthwhile games via the Apple Arcade service). Besides that, the usual notes still apply here: the Xbox One controller requires AA batteries whereas the DualShock 4 has a rechargeable battery that tends to degrade over time; the Xbox One pad is a bit easier to set up for PC games outside of Steam; whether the asymmetrical joysticks and trigger feel on Microsoft's pad is better is largely a matter of personal preference, and so on. Regardless, if you need a spare pad for using beyond an Xbox, this is a solid deal.\n\nIf you're good on controllers, though, we have plenty more discounts on USB-C PD wall chargers, microSD cards, Amazon devices, AMD Ryzen processors, Bluetooth headphones, and much more.
