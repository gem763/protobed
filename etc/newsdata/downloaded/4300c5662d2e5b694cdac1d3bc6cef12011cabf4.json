Since this form of funding does not need to be repaid, it is the ideal place to start.\n\nNext on the list should be federal student loans as they often come with low interest rates and consumer-focused protections like forbearance options and access to income-driven repayment plans.\n\nIf there are still cost gaps left to fill after the aforementioned options have been exhausted, a student should then finally turn to the private student loan market. In recent years, the private student loan industry has taken off as more young adults scramble to come up with extra money to pay for their college degrees.\n\nOf the $1.52 trillion in outstanding student loan debt held by this country, $102 billion of it, or 7.5%, derives from private student loans. There are now over 100 different private student loan lenders, while an estimated 1.4 million students use private loans each year.\n\nUsing LendEDU's exclusive data featuring close to 200,000 users that have gone through the company's private student loan portal, I took a deep dive into the private student loan industry to see how it has changed since 2016.\n\nData shows variable interest rates have remained lower than fixed interest rates\n\nWhen taking on a private student loan, borrowers usually have two options when it comes to the type of interest rate: variable or fixed.\n\nVariable rates are seen as riskier since the interest rate has the potential to skyrocket over the term of the loan if a seismic shift occurs in the economy. With fixed rates, on the other hand, borrowers know what rate they will be paying throughout the life of their loan.\n\nLendEDU's data revealed that borrowers have been rewarded over the last few years if they opted for the bolder of the two interest choices.\n\nIn each year of data that this study analyzed, with the exception of 2019 which is not yet fully mature and subject to change, the variable rate on a private student loan was always lower than the fixed interest rate. In one year, 2017, the average variable rate was 2.10% lower than the average fixed rate.\n\nFor prospective private student loan borrowers, this data could prove to be quite valuable if they are able to save a good chunk of change by selecting a variable rate rather than fixed. Of course, this trend could be reversed within a year's time, but it appears to be holding quite steady since 2016 and should remain firm if the current low-interest lending environment persists.\n\nHaving a cosigner makes a world of difference\n\nAnother trend that came from this private student loan data was the wide disparity between those who applied for private student loans and those who get approved.\n\nTake, for instance, this chart on applied versus approved credit scores:\n\nOr, this one on applied versus approved incomes:\n\nAs it is clearly depicted, private student lenders are looking for borrowers that fall into the top echelon of personal finance, even if the typical private loan applicant is nowhere close to that level.\n\nThis trend makes a whole lot more sense when it is tied together with some data the LendEDU study published in regards to approval rates.\n\nIt's clear that private student loan lenders are looking for borrowers with a financially secure and creditworthy cosigner \u2014 whether that be a parent, guardian, or someone else.\n\nFor example, the cosigner approval rate in 2017 was 43% compared to the no-cosigner approval rate of 7.61% from the same year. Even in 2019, the cosigner approval rate is already more than 25 percentage points higher than the no-cosigner approval rate.\n\nThis explains the canyon-sized gap between those who apply and those who are approved for private student loans. Students' chances of being approved are significantly boosted by cosigners with substantial income and good credit scores, making them safe investments for lenders.\n\nFresh high school graduates applying for private loans without a cosigner rarely have enough income or credit history to encourage a lender into taking a calculated risk.\n\nWith the private student loan market likely to only further gain market share in the future, potential applicants can hopefully learn two main things from LendEDU's data: taking on a variable rate as opposed to a fixed is worth a strong consideration and applying with a cosigner will make a world of difference.", "description": "When getting approved for a loan, having a financially secure cosigner made a big difference, according to LendEDU's exclusive data.", "authors": ["Mike Brown"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d5c56dfcd97843185016e64?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
