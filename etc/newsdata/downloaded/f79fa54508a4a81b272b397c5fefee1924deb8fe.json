The 65-year-old has been on the run since March when authorities in South Carolina secured fraud indictments against him.\n\nCourt filings say the company provided cash advances to veterans and others that would then be repaid by their pensions. Traders weren't told the advances had interest rates that could top 240%. The upfront money came from investors who were promised up to 8% back on their investments.\n\nAn April letter to investors says about 25 states are investigating or have taken action against Kohn's company.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
