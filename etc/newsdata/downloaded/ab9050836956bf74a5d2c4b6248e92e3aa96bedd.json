The House Judiciary Committee has also launched an investigation into competition in the digital marketplace, which has focused heavily on the dominant players \u2014 Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.\n\nThe government investigators are also likely to look into Facebook's acquisition of popular messaging app WhatsApp and its digital advertising business practices.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday offered some of his first public comments on his company's controversial decision to buy Instagram amid intensifying scrutiny over Facebook's power and market dominance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/instagram_110118istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
