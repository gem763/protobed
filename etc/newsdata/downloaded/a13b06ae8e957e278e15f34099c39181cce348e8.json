Stalkerware, however, is generally used by individuals to spy on those close to them.\n\n\u201cThese openly-sold consumer surveillance programs are often used for spying on colleagues, family members or partners, and are in great demand,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cFor a relatively modest fee, sometimes as little as $7 per month, these apps stay hidden while keeping their operators informed about the device activity, such as its owner\u2019s location, browser history, text messages, social media chats, and more. Some of them can even make video and voice recordings.\u201d\n\nIn all, Kaspersky found 518,223 cases where the presence of stalkerware on users\u2019 devices was registered or an attempt was made to install spyware without the consent of the victims involved.\n\nStalkerware needs a vector to infiltrate a target\u2019s mobile device defenses. Most often, this is done by manually installing the app on the smartphone or tablet. Other times, it\u2019s remotely administered via spear phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links, which when clicked, download the app surreptitiously without user\u2019s knowledge.\n\nCredit: Kaspersky The rise of stalkerware in 2019\n\nOnce installed, they were found to masquerade as parental control apps designed to monitor childrens\u2019 whereabouts, or as anti-theft apps that operate stealthily to evade detection and deletion.\n\nTheTruthSpy, for example, markets itself as \u201cthe best Catch Cheating Spouse App available today,\u201d with features to track location, manage calls, monitor internet browsing activities, and spy on instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Viber, and Snapchat. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s completely undetectable.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that although WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), the security feature is of no use when the endpoint itself is compromised with surveillance software.\n\n\u201cIt may take time to discover the role of stalkers on the cyberthreat landscape, but more incidents are now accounted for,\u201d Kaspersky said. \u201cThose with bad intentions may use it to monitor employee emails, track children\u2019s movements and even spy on what a partner is up to. Such uses may lead to harassment, surveillance without consent, stalking and even domestic violence.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time stalker apps have been found on Android. Earlier this July, researchers from cybersecurity form Avast detected eight such apps on the Google Play Store that allowed people to keep tabs on employees, romantic partners, or kids, prompting Google to take them down.\n\nSpyware and stalkerware are intentionally designed to make them hard to find and hard to remove. To protect yourself against such threats, it\u2019s essential that you run a malware scan, and physically secure your device with a strong password. If all else fails, a drastic step would be to reset your phone back to factory settings.\n\nRead next: Facebook faces EU grilling over Libra 'cryptocurrency' after losing PayPal backing", "description": "Stalkware apps have increased a whopping 373 percent during the first eight months of 2019 when compared to the same period the year before.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fstalkerware.png&signature=a6c3773433943e8d1c00eee88017dfbc", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
