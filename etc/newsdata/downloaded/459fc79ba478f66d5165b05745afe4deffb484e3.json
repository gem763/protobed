(AP) - Kyle Palmieri and Myles Wood scored in the second period, and the New Jersey Devils held off the New York Rangers 5-2 Thursday night to earn their first win of the season.\n\nBlake Coleman, Nikita Gusev and P.K. Subban also scored and Matt Tennyson had two assists for the Devils, who came in 0-4-2. Mackenzie Blackwood finished with 29 saves.\n\nTony DeAngelo and Jesper Fast had goals for the Rangers, who had played just three games in the first 14 days of the season. Alexandar Georgiev stopped 33 shots.\n\nThis was the first matchup between New Jersey\u2019s Jack Hughes and New York\u2019s Kaapo Kakko, who were selected with the first two picks in this year\u2019s draft. Hughes, centering the top line against the Rangers in place of Nico Hischier, came in without a point in six games, while Kakko had a goal in three games.\n\nThe Rangers finished 0 for 6 on the power play, while New Jersey was 1 for 6.\n\nWith the Devils leading 3-1 after two periods, Ryan Strome sent a pass in front to Fast from the left corner, and Fast poked it into the open net for his first at 2:22 of the third.\n\nHall nearly restored New Jersey\u2019s two-goal lead at 7:08, but it was waved off because the officials said Hall pushed it in with his hand. Devils coach John Hynes challenged and the call stood, resulting in a delay-of-game penalty.\n\nMoments after a Devils power play expired, Gusev intercepted Artemi Panarin\u2019s pass intended for Fast coming out of the penalty box, skated in and beat Georgiev for his third with 7:39 remaining.\n\nSubban added an empty-netter in the final minute for his first goal since joining the Devils in an offseason trade.\n\nGeorgiev had a great pad save on Wayne Simmonds in front less than 20 seconds into the second period to preserve a 1-1 tie\n\nWith the Rangers\u2018 Brady Skjei off for interference, Palmieri got the puck off the faceoff, brought the puck into the right circle, pulled it back to get around defenseman Marc Staal and as Georgiev went down to cut off his angle, Palmieri fired it top shelf for his third at 2:18. It was New Jersey\u2019s first power-play goal of the season after they failed on their first 20 chances, including two in the first period\n\nNearly seven minutes into the period, New Jersey\u2019s Taylor Hall left his feet and, leading with his elbow, delivered a hard hit high on defenseman Adam Fox, who was down on the ice behind the Rangers\u2018 net for several minutes. Hall received a double-minor for elbowing and roughing. Skjei, who went after Hall after the hit, was given a minor for roughing.\n\nWood put New Jersey up 3-1 as he deflected Tennyson\u2019s shot from the right point past Georgiev from in front with 7:35 left. Hughes got an assist on the play, earning his first NHL point.\n\nPavel Zacha had a chance to extend the lead on a breakaway with New Jersey on a power play with 4:20 remaining in the middle period, but his backhand try was stopped by Georgiev.\n\nThe Rangers got on the scoreboard first for the fourth time in four games this season on DeAngelo\u2019s backhander off a rebound.\n\nColeman tied it with 7:02 remaining in the first as he brought the puck up the right side and fired a shot from the right circle that hit Georgiev\u2019s mask, rolled down his body and went between his legs and in.\n\nNOTES: New Jersey executive vice president and assistant GM Jim Fitzgerald made his debut behind the bench as an assistant coach. \u2026 Hischier was out with an upper-body injury and is day to day. \u2026 The Devils also scratched D Connor Carrick and C Jesper Boqvist. \u2026 New Jersey improved to 7-1-1 in the last nine meetings at home against the Rangers. \u2026 The teams play three more times this season: Nov. 30 at Prudential Center, and Jan. 9 and March 7 at Madison Square Garden. \u2026 The Rangers scratched LW Brendan Lemieux. \u2026 The Rangers lost in regulation against the Devils for just the sixth time in the last 24 meetings, falling to 14-6-4.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRangers: At Washington on Friday night to complete their first back-to-back of the season.\n\nDevils: Host Vancouver on Saturday before a stretch of two games in 12 days.\n\n___\n\nFollow Vin Cherwoo at https://twitter.com/VinCherwooAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyle Palmieri and Myles Wood scored in the second period, and the New Jersey Devils held off the New York Rangers 5-2 Thursday night to earn their first win of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vin A.
