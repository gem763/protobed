It also suggested the government attach more importance to problems such as the shortage of teachers and the relatively low salaries of kindergarten instructors.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a question-and-answer session for Carrie Lam to answer lawmakers' queries about the address was suspended twice, and at least 10 opposition lawmakers were dispelled from the venue for improper behavior.\n\nDuring the session, LegCo chairman Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen stressed repeatedly that many citizens look forward to learning more details of the address and lawmakers should take the chance to raise questions for their voters instead of causing disruptions.", "description": "Social groups in Hong Kong said that this year's policy address by the special administrative region's chief executive has answered calls to remedy the problem of increasingly unaffordable housing and solve the deadlock in acquiring more land for public housing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/18/5da9165ca310cf3e97a1d293.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
