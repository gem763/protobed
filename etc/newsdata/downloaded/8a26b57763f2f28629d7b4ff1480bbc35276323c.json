Doing a rep range of 12-15 and working at about 75 per cent of your max RPM.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Nothing too strenuous, just keep the blood flowing. I\u2019ve taken out the big compound lifts: no deadlifts, no squatting.\u2019\n\nKelvin then heads to rehearsals with partner Oti Mabuse at 10am \u2013 and dances until 10pm.\n\nOuch.\n\nKelvin repeats the gym routine from Monday to Thursday, and rehearses with Oti from 10am to 8pm on Wednesday and 10am to 6pm on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking about his diet, he said: \u2018I probably eat about 300-350g of carbs a day. About 160g of protein, about 60-80g of fat, which I think is about 2,500-3,000 calories.\n\n\u2018Carbs get a bad press, but they\u2019re pretty important. I\u2019ve stayed pretty lean, I\u2019m about five kilos lighter than I was a couple of months ago. Which is fine, I think \u2013 it helps with the dancing.\u2019\n\nWell, he\u2019s doing something right \u2013 Kelvin is one of the firm favourites to lift the Glitterball trophy after consistently impressing the judges and even achieving the first 10s of the series with his week three Charleston.\n\nThe dad-of-two will this week take on a cha cha cha set to Aston Merrygold\u2019s Get Stupid in the hopes that his high scores will continue.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
