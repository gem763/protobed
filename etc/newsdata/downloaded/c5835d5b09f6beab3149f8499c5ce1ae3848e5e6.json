This is an account that is set up alongside your health insurance, and you can choose to have pretax dollars from your paycheck routed into it. Those funds can then be used to pay for certain qualifying medical expenses.\n\nWhat are the benefits of an FSA?\n\nThe biggest benefit of a flexible spending account (FSA) is that it can reduce how much you pay in taxes. You don\u2019t pay taxes on the money that is deposited into this account out of your paycheck. If you know you\u2019ll spend all of the money on qualifying expenses within the time period required, you can cover medical costs you\u2019d already have to pay for while lowering your tax burden.\n\nSome people also like FSAs because they lighten the burden of health care costs throughout the year. If you put money from every paycheck into the FSA savings account, then it may be easier for you to pay for prescriptions, copays and deductibles later.\n\nHow does a FSA debit card work?\n\nFlexible spending account options may be offered alongside your employer-sponsored health plans. They are also sometimes an option when you purchase insurance in the health care marketplace. However, you must choose to enroll in the FSA plan\u2014it\u2019s not an automatic part of your coverage, even when it\u2019s available.\n\nOnce you enroll, you can decide how much of your pretax income you would like to contribute to the account. The IRS limits you to contributing $2,650 a year to this account. Someone who is married can contribute up to the same amount into their spouse\u2019s FSA.\n\nAlso read: The U.S. can slash health-care costs 75% with 2 fundamental changes \u2014 and without \u2018Medicare for All\u2019\n\nOnce you fund your FSA, you can use the account to pay for eligible medical expenses or buy eligible qualifying products. One way of doing so is by using your FSA card just as you would use any debit or credit card at check out.\n\nRemember to only use your FSA on eligible expenses, and keep your receipts and another backup. If you\u2019re ever audited, the IRS may ask you to prove that you used your FSA money for approved spending.\n\nWhat items are eligible for FSA?\n\nFSA funds are typically used to cover medical and health-related expenses. Some things you can use your FSA to cover include:\n\nPayments to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers that are part of your copay or deductible\n\nAny medication that is backed by a doctor\u2019s prescription, including over-the-counter meds\n\nInsulin, even without a prescription\n\nNecessary medical equipment such as crutches or walkers\n\nDiagnostic devices such as glucose monitors or blood pressure cuffs\n\nSupplies such as bandages\n\nVision care, including eyeglasses or contact lenses\n\nCan I use my FSA card online?\n\nYes, you can use your FSA card for online spending, as long as it\u2019s one of the eligible expenses listed above. That might include making a payment on a bill to your doctor\u2019s office via an online portal or buying prescribed medical supplies via an online vendor.\n\nCan I get cash off my FSA card?\n\nIn rare cases when you need to pay for qualifying expenses but the provider or store doesn\u2019t take your FSA card, you can use your card to withdraw cash to make the payment. However, you must keep all the documentation proving that the amount you withdrew was used for eligible expenses. If you\u2019re ever questioned by the FSA provider or the IRS about the withdrawal and you don\u2019t have the supporting documentation, you may be required to payback those funds.\n\nAre there any downsides to an FSA card and account?\n\nThe biggest disadvantage of an FSA account is that the funds are use-it-or-lose-it\u2014even though it\u2019s your money. FSA providers let you know what the deadline is for using all of your contributions from the year. They typically range from January through March of the following year.\n\nSee: Here\u2019s one health-insurance choice that can save you money now and make you even more later\n\nBecause you can\u2019t simply withdraw the unused funds or spend them on something else instead, make sure that you estimate your medical expenses using as much information as you can. And when in doubt, estimate slightly lower so you aren\u2019t left with a loss at the end of each year.\n\nIs an FSA the same thing as an HSA?\n\nAn FSA and a health savings account (HSA) are slightly different. HSAs are only available to individuals with high deductible plans. Because of this, the contribution limits are higher. HSA balances also roll over to be used for the next year, unlike FSA balances.\n\nSee: How to make the most of your HSA \u2014 for now, and the future\n\nDoes your FSA card impact your credit?\n\n\u201cWhile FSA cards look and behave like credit or debit cards where they\u2019re accepted,\u201d says credit scoring expert Barry Paperno, \u201clike debit cards, they don\u2019t appear on your credit report or get included in your credit scores. That\u2019s primarily because they\u2019re not truly credit accounts where a lender is making a loan to you. Rather, the FSA consists of money you have transferred, or will be transferring, from your paycheck.\u201d", "description": "The biggest benefit of a\u00a0flexible spending account is that it can reduce your taxes.
