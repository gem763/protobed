By the time I had finished my first pint they had run out.\n\n'We are a civilised crowd us real ale drinkers so we didn't kick off but some people walked out in disappointment. I will certainly not be coming again.'\n\nLynne Rimell was one of the disappointed customers who found that by 8.15pm the beer had run out\n\nA total of 4,000 pints of beer and cider were consumed at the event, which ran on last Friday and Saturday\n\nSteve Jones said: 'The event was seriously badly organised. Surely if there's a run on stock they should have a back up plan to get more in.\n\n'In all the years of beer festivals I've never known anything like it.'\n\nThe West Dorset branch of CAMRA blamed the national organisation, saying they had to adhere to strict guidelines over the amount of beer and cider they could order.\n\nA CAMRA poster advertising the Weymouth festival\n\nThey claim they were provided with 10 fewer barrels than the previous year.\n\nDavid Harris, the beer festival organiser, blamed the CAMRA headquarters, said: 'We have run the beer festival since 2005 but this was the first year we have had to get guidance from head office over how much beer we could order.\n\n'We gave them a number of 840 people we expected over the two days and wanted 58 firkins which would have given us 4,000 pints of ale.\n\n'We felt that amount of beer would have allowed for any margin of growth in numbers of people.\n\n'But we were told we could only order 52 firkins in total.'\n\nCatherine Tonry, National Festival Organiser for CAMRA, said: 'CAMRA operates a policy in that each local festival applies for beer festival funding based on the number of visitors they expect through the door.\n\n'The Weymouth branch's beer order was based on previous attendee numbers - obviously, the festival was much more popular this year than ever before.\n\n'It's great to see the people of Weymouth enjoying the range of brews available at a CAMRA fest, and we're confident that the success will encourage the branch to order more beer for next year.'", "description": "Tickets for Weymouth Octoberfest in Dorset cost \u00a311.50 each and drinkers were promised a choice of 50 real ales.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19392096-0-image-a-8_1570445995746.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
