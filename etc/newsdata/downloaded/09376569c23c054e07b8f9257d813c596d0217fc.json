Further details about the company's decision were not provided.\n\nHelmet manufacturer Xenith ended its partnership with Brown last week, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nDrew Rosenhaus, Brown's agent, said during an appearance on ESPN's SportsCenter (via Frank Schwab of Yahoo Sports) on Sept. 11 that his client denies the allegations.\n\n\"Antonio will be cleared,\" Rosenhaus said. \"These allegations in the lawsuit are false. They are not true. They are absolutely untrue.\"\n\nHe added: \"In no way do we condone any type of illegal conduct, misbehavior. None of this happened here. This is a money grab. I'll repeat this: This is a money grab. In my opinion, this is a money grab.\"\n\nA second woman alleged Brown behaved inappropriately toward her while she was painting a mural in his home in 2017. She detailed an encounter with the then-Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver to Robert Klemko of Sports Illustrated:\n\n\"I was about 40 percent done on the second day, and I'm on my knees painting the bottom, and he walks up to me butt-ass naked, with a hand cloth covering his [penis] and starts having a conversation with me. Unfortunately, I've been tried [by men] a lot of times, so I just kept my cool and kept painting. After that, it all ended abruptly.\"\n\nBrown's attorney, Darren Heitner, provided a statement to TMZ Sports: \"Antonio Brown has reviewed the sexual misconduct allegations made by an unnamed artist included in a recently published Sports Illustrated article and denies that he ever engaged in such activities. There will be no further comment at this time.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Miami native was traded from the Steelers to the Oakland Raiders in March. He was released by the Raiders in early September after fractures quickly developed in his relationships with general manager Mike Mayock and head coach Jon Gruden.\n\nHe signed with the Patriots following his release from Oakland and made his team debut Sunday, catching four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown in a win over the Miami Dolphins.\n\nThe NFL is investigating the allegations against him.", "description": "A  Nike  spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that  New England Patriots  wide receiver  Antonio Brown  no longer has an endorsement deal with the company...", "authors": ["Tim Daniels"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/828/978/hi-res-32890ab60595524140d05ea5184cc3e8_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
