That continuity is key,\u201d Silverwood told a news conference on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe step up will bring a lot more responsibility. Not a lot will change. I\u2019ll have to step back a little bit, but I want (the players) to know I\u2019m available.\n\n\u201cI think (there\u2019s a good) relationship between myself and the two captains, and I\u2019ve got a strong relationship with all the players and backroom staff,\u201d he added referring to test skipper Joe Root and limited overs captain Eoin Morgan.\n\nEngland have struggled for consistency in tests in recent years, slipping to fourth in the world rankings, but have enjoyed sustained success in one-day cricket, winning their first 50-over World Cup this year on home soil.\n\nSilverwood said his top priority will be to lay the foundations for a test squad as England prepare for the upcoming tours to New Zealand and South Africa.\n\n\u201cJob number one would be helping Joe,\u201d said Silverwood.\n\n\u201cPutting a lot of support around Joe and making sure that the test team starts moving forward and keeps moving forward so that in two years\u2019 time when we go back to Australia we can make a real impact out there.\n\n\u201cTo move the test team forward we\u2019re going to have to look at batting for long periods of time and continue to build the bowling attack, as well as being consistent in winning away from home.\u201d\n\nEngland director of cricket Ashley Giles said Silverwood\u2019s character as well as an exceptional county record - which includes guiding Essex to the County Championship title in 2017 - made him the leading candidate for the job.\n\nSilverwood edged out several experienced candidates, including the likes of former India and South Africa coach Gary Kirsten, for the England job.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a winner and he can only prove that where he\u2019s been able to prove it,\u201d Giles added. \u201cYou can only be tested within the environments you\u2019ve worked and he couldn\u2019t have worked in a more pressurised environment.\u201d", "description": "England's new head coach Chris Silverwood believes his strong relationship with the players and continuity in the backroom structure will reap dividends in a bid to make the national team successful across all formats.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439324813&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991MC", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
