And even though economic conditions have brightened somewhat, Mr. Powell said the Fed isn't considering raising rates anytime soon without inflation moving significantly higher, assuring investors of a continuation of the current accommodative environment for stocks and other risky assets.\n\nInvestors responded favorably. Even ahead of the announcement, most investors weren't betting on another interest-rate cut in December. Those expectations stayed relatively stable following the decision, according to CME Group's Fed-fund futures data.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve just put a big stake in the ground on the future rate path. Markets believe that, irrespective of easing trade issues, there is a gigantic pause on future rate increases,\" said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, a Richmond, Va.-based money manager.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.3%, or 9.88 points, to 3046.77, topping its previous record set on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 115.27 points, or 0.4%, to 27186.69, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 27.12 points, or 0.3%, to 8303.98. The Dow and Nasdaq remain off 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively, from their July records.\n\nThe Fed has been a major contributor to the stock market's gains this year. The S&P 500 is up nearly 22%, with much of that support coming from the Fed after it abandoned efforts to tighten monetary policy and kicked off a new phase of interest-rate cuts.\n\nA weakening global economy, faltering manufacturing activity and signs growth in the U.S. has been slowing down--all exacerbated by an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China--factored into the Fed's reasoning for a fresh round of rate cuts.\n\nNow, those pressures appear to be somewhat easing, but not enough to justify tightening fiscal policy just yet. Trade tensions have somewhat improved between the U.S. and China, the U.K. has inched closer toward achieving a split from the European Union and the U.S. economy remains solid despite some pockets of weakness, said Mr. Powell.\n\n\"There's plenty of risk left, but I have to say the risks seem to have subsided,\" Mr. Powell said.\n\nBut stocks remain susceptible to further bouts of volatility, analysts warned.\n\nKey economic data is due later this week, with the October's jobs report and a survey of manufacturing activity set to be released Friday. There is also the possibility that the U.S. and China fail to solidify their trade truce, while the U.K.'s divorce from the European Union remains far from certain.\n\n\"Trade policy will continue to be the main factor for investor sentiment and earnings will continue to move stocks,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. \"But Fed policy will now be moved to the backburner.\"\n\nBeyond the stock market's broader move, corporate earnings drove most of the bigger swings in individual stocks.\n\nShares of General Electric jumped $1.04, or 11%, to $10.11 after the company raised its cash-flow outlook for the year.\n\nGarmin's stock added $8.44, or 9.6%, to $96.35 after the maker of fitness watches and navigation devices topped Wall Street forecasts and provided upbeat guidance.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Yum Brands fell $6.38, or 5.8%, to $103.34 after the restaurant chain marked down the value of its investment in online food delivery app GrubHub. Shares of Molson Coors Brewing also fell, shedding $1.69, or 3.1%, to $53 after the maker of Coors Light and Miller Lite disclosed plans to cut hundreds of jobs.\n\nSome of the biggest publicly traded companies reported results after the closing bell, including Facebook and Apple.\n\nShares of Facebook jumped 1.5% in after-hours trading after the social-networking company exceeded analysts' expectations. Apple's stock also jumped more than 1% late Wednesday after topping forecasts.\n\nElsewhere, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up less than 0.1%. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.5%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 0.6%.\n\nWill Horner contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 17:22 ET (21:22 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
