Courtesy Laurian Ghinitoiu\n\nThe museum is made up of three distinct galleries with sweeping views over the river and sculpture park.\n\nThe double-curve of the museum's exterior is created via straight aluminum panels arranged, as BIG describes it, \"like a stack of books\" -- each panel is shifted ever so slightly forward.\n\nThis oxymoron is at the heart of the Twist's aesthetic appeal: straight panels creating a curved effect.\n\nPhotographs of the building have an eerie, otherworldly feel -- this manmade bridge-museum-hybrid seemingly rising inconspicuously out of its natural surroundings.\n\nThe unusual curve design catches the attention.

It's been a staple of the Norwegian cultural scene for the past two decades, spotlighting work by prolific Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama and Icelandic environmentalist Olafur Eliasson, to name just two.", "description": "A striking bridge meets an intriguing modern art museum meets the splendor of the Norwegian natural landscape in the Twist -- the latest project from BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group, located about an hour's drive from Oslo", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191022110100-04-big-kis-the-twist-image-by-laurian-ghinitoiu-copy-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
