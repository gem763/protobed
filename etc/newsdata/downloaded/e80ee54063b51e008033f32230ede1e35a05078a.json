Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race Democratic lawmakers, 2020 candidates pay tribute to Conyers 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE wants to forgive all debt for all students. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike Tlaib endorses Sanders at Detroit campaign rally MORE wants to concentrate on lower income borrowers. And former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden: Trump 'an idiot' for saying Russian interference a 'hoax' Biden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE wants to fix the unduly complicated loan forgiveness program for teachers.\n\nThe problem they\u2019re trying to address is undeniable. Student debt has grown to $1.6 trillion, up from about $90 billion two decades ago, with two thirds of 2018 graduates owing money. While the default rate is down slightly, a quarter of those receiving federal direct loans were delinquent or in default at the end of 2018, a recent analysis found.\n\nThis burden has hit hard in the millennial generation, contributing to a 9 percentage point drop in homeownership among young adults in a decade, according to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Lifting this financial burden, the thinking goes, would stimulate the economy by allowing young borrowers to improve credit ratings and buy homes.\n\nAt the same time, forgiving this debt is problematic. First, it\u2019s expensive. Sanders\u2019 plan to forgive loans from public sources and buy up private loans would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion over 10 years. Warren\u2019s more limited plan would still cost $640 billion.\n\nThen there\u2019s the equity issue. Even when focusing on families making less than $250,000, Warren\u2019s plan would give two thirds of the benefits to the top 40 percent of earners, according to a Brookings Institution analysis.\n\nAnd is universal debt forgiveness fair to the students who chose their college or their major with student loans in mind? Or to those who made career choices enabling them to pay off their loans? What about the students who go to college after this payout: Would they also have future loans wiped clean? Even if \u201cfree college\u201d becomes a reality, it won\u2019t cover tuition at private institutions or graduate schools.\n\nRather than erase student loans without any strings, it makes more sense to leverage this debt to address other societal problems. Legislation now in Congress offers a novel approach. The bill introduced in June by Rep. Marcy Kaptur Marcia (Marcy) Carolyn KapturGOP lawmakers express concerns about Giuliani's work in Ukraine On The Money: Trump to meet China's vice premier during trade talks | Appeals court says Deutsche Bank doesn't have Trump's tax returns | House Appropriations Chair Nita Lowey to retire DeLauro enters race to succeed Lowey as Appropriations chief MORE (D-Ohio) would launch a pilot program allowing some borrowers to convert their student debt into mortgage debt. They\u2019d still owe the money, but they\u2019d be paying it toward a home, building equity in their future.\n\nThe proposal has some limitations. The borrowers would have to be \u201ccreditworthy federal student debt holders,\u201d meaning they would have to have federal loans, earn good credit ratings, have a job, and be up to date on payments. That would rule out many of the 44.7 million student borrowers, but would still leave millions of potential homeowners.\n\nThe homes would be those on the federal foreclosure rolls or in land banks. Currently, there are 16.8 million vacant homes nationwide, including large inventories held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Selling these homes at a discount to student loan holders could help neighborhoods recover both in terms of property values and economic activity. The borrowers would have to stay in the house for at least three years, to prevent flipping.\n\nRather than offer blanket loan forgiveness, this bill provides a way to turn that debt burden into a benefit for the borrower and the community. Kaptur and her team have discussed the idea with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Elizabeth (Betsy) Dee DeVosDeVos earns Education Dept. 0,000 fine after preliminary injunction violation Trump Education Department official to run for Senate, call for student debt forgiveness: report The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - GOP snags mic with impeachment protest MORE and say she would be open to her department helping to identify qualified borrowers. Congress could easily build the measure into the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act introduced this month or attached to an appropriations bill.\n\nSome presidential candidates are offering other ideas linking debt forgiveness to public needs. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar Amy Jean Klobuchar2020 Democrats commend US forces on ISIS leader's death Watch live: 2020 Democrats speak at criminal justice forum 100 days to Iowa: Uncertainty reigns over fluid race MORE would forgive loans for students going into \u201cin-demand\u201d professions. Like Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker Cory Anthony BookerWatch live: 2020 Democrats speak at criminal justice forum Most oppose reparations for slavery: poll The Hill's Campaign Report: DNC toughens December debate criteria MORE and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke would focus loan forgiveness on teachers.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisDemocratic lawmakers, 2020 candidates pay tribute to Conyers 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike Harris reverses course, attends South Carolina justice forum MORE has proposed wiping out debt for Pell grant recipients who start businesses in Opportunity Zones, economically-distressed communities where investors creating jobs can receive tax credits.\n\nThis is the kind of thinking that makes sense\u2014economically and politically\u2014to provide relief to what has become a generation of debtors. That said, there needs to be a more holistic solution to making higher education more affordable for students going forward, whether by making public institutions free or increasing the size of Pell grants\u2014or a combination of the approaches.\n\nPhyllis W.
