But because Buttigieg is a smart guy \u2014 a Rhodes scholar, even \u2014 I assumed that his religious politics at least included some kind of intelligent-sounding explanation for his position on abortion, his support for his party\u2019s absolutely-no-restrictions line.\n\nButtigieg offered such an explanation on the radio early this month. I want to quote it in full, because right and left have been arguing over what he meant.\n\nNow, right now, [Republicans] hold everybody in line with this one kind of piece of doctrine about abortion, right, which is obviously a tough issue for a lot of people to think through morally. Then again, you know, there\u2019s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath, and so even that is something that we can interpret differently. \u2026 No matter where you think about the kind of cosmic question of where life begins, most Americans can get on board with the idea of, alright, I might draw the line here, you might draw the line there, but the most important thing is the person who should be drawing the line is the woman making the decision.\n\nThe immediate conservative interpretation of this quote was that Buttigieg was justifying pro-choice maximalism with Scripture, by citing the same Bible he quotes to condemn the G.O.P. on other issues to claim that human life begins with a baby\u2019s first breath outside the womb. The progressive response was that no, he was saying instead that (to quote the noted theologian Wiggum of Springfield) the Bible says a lot of things, nothing it says on abortion is definitive, and so even a polity influenced by Christian piety should leave both believers and nonbelievers alone to decide the fetal personhood question themselves.\n\nThe progressive interpretation is probably the more accurate description of what was going through Buttigieg\u2019s mind when he was answering the question. But the conservative claim that he believes that personhood is mystically imparted via the inhalation of oxygen is the more accurate description of his actual legal position, and the emerging orthodoxy of his party.", "description": "How the party of science decided that personhood begins at birth.", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/opinion/17douthatWeb/17douthatWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
