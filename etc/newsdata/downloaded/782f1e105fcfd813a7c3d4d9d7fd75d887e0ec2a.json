NO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cWe must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s call memo shows Trump sought a \u201cfavor\u201d from Zelensky. Democrats say it was a demand to investigate Biden \u2014 the president\u2019s potential 2020 election rival \u2014 and a Ukrainian firm that hired Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Premeditated strategy\u2019 \u2013\n\nHill meanwhile appeared before congressional investigators despite the White House declaration last week that it would not cooperate with the probe.\n\nHer lawyer Lee Wolosky said Hill had \u201creceived a congressional subpoena\u201d to testify, suggesting top Democrats had feared the White House might seek an 11th-hour block to her testimony, as they did with previous witnesses.\n\nHouse Democrat Jamie Raskin said he believes Hill could shed light on what he described as \u201ca very powerful shadow foreign policy being operated out of Ukraine by the president\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u201d that bypassed normal channels in order to apply coercive pressure on Kiev.\n\n\u201cI think that she would have a comprehensive overview of that whole situation,\u201d Raskin told MSNBC.\n\nRaskin said testimony from various witnesses also appears to confirm a \u201cdeliberate, premeditated strategy by the president\u201d to condition some $390 million in military assistance to Ukraine on that country investigating the Bidens.\n\nTestifying on Thursday will be US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who shortly before Trump\u2019s Ukraine call participated in several text messages with other US diplomats who expressed concern that Trump was seeking a quid pro quo for the military aid.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Sondland intends to tell Congress that his text to a fellow diplomat denying such a trade-off was relayed directly to him by Trump.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US lawmakers returning from a two-week break braced for an impeachment brawl in Washington, as a former White House aide", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/2b0c1e_fiona-hill-special-assistant-us-president-donald-trump-on-russian-affairs-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
