Here are a few post-fight musings \u2026\n\n* * * * *\n\n1. Inhaler-gate\n\nGallery Greg Hardy vs. Ben Sosoli at UFC on ESPN 6: Best photos view 10 images\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to even beginning with this whole inhaler controversy that turned Greg Hardy\u2019s (4-1 MMA, 2-1 UFC) unanimous decision win over Ben Sosoli (7-2 MMA, 0-0 UFC) into a no contest. Never in all my years covering combat sports have I seen a fight ask to use an inhaler mid-fight, let alone actually receive approval to do it.\n\nThe crux of this issue seems to come down to this: Hardy believed disclosing the inhaler to the commission pre-fight in Boston as well as on his U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) paperwork allowed him use of the inhaler at all times. He apparently didn\u2019t have knowledge that in-competition use is illegal, and the commission member who gave him approval in the footage was misinformed, as well.\n\nHardy\u2019s chief corner, Din Thomas, probably should have recognized using an inhaler between rounds was a violation of the rules. However, it\u2019s understandable that in the midst of the chaos of a fight, he didn\u2019t fully comprehend what was going on. Still, though, he should\u2019ve had a better understanding of the moment, as there\u2019s a reason this has never happened to anyone else.\n\nThe entire thing was just bizarre, and it\u2019s magnified by the fact it happened to Hardy, who is a lightning rod for controversy as it is. It didn\u2019t much seem like he needed it, anyway, because he was way ahead in the fight with Sosoli.\n\nHardy did the illegal action, though, and while it may not always be the case with him, he suffered the consequences this time.", "description": "Thoughts and analysis to come out of UFC on ESPN 6, which took place Friday in Boston.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/greg-hardy-ben-sosoli-ufc-boston-3.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
