The highly social birds will also remember that person if they come near their nests again, according to researchers from the University of Exeter. In the study, a person unknown to the wild jackdaws approached their nest. At the same time scientists played a recording of a warning call (threatening) or \u201ccontact calls\u201d (non-threatening). The next time jackdaws saw this same person, the birds that had previously heard the warning call were defensive and returned to their nests more than twice as quickly on average.

Is it too difficult to contemplate that the same may be true for brain death? A recent experiment suggests this idea is not just a wild imagining.\u201d\n\nKoch is referring to a series of surprising experiments in which scientists managed to restore some function in the brains of pigs that had been dead for hours. The research, which was published this April in the journal Nature, sparked intense ethical and scientific debate. It seems to point to death as a process, not an event, and raises the possibility that one day, scientists will be able to completely revive a dead brain.\n\nIf you think the research sounds Frankenstein-like, you're not alone. Even the scientists who conducted the experiments grappled with the ethical conundrum it presented, and had a plan B in which they'd stop the experiment immediately if the brains presented evidence of consciousness. Luckily for them, they didn't - but that could change one day as research progresses.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "If you're reading this, you know what living looks like - movement, neurological activity, thought, action.
