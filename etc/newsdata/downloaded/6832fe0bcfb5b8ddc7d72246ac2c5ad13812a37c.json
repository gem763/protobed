But not all suppliers offer the discount.\u2019\n\nWarm Home Discount: Millions are eligible for the rebate, but need to take action to secure it\n\nThe vast majority of energy companies are signed up to the scheme, but dozens of smaller suppliers are not \u2013 affecting around 100,000 customers. People in this category should switch suppliers to a cheaper deal with a company that offers the discount.\n\nThey need to apply to the new supplier to get it. A full list of those participating can be found online at gov.uk/the-warm-home-discount-scheme/energy-suppliers.\n\nAutomatic deductions from bills are awarded to a \u2018core group\u2019 of customers \u2013 those receiving the \u2018guarantee credit\u2019 element of Pension Credit. This benefit tops up income to a minimum level for people of State pension age.\n\nOthers fall into the \u2018broader group\u2019 and need to apply directly. For example, people on low incomes, in receipt of certain means-tested benefits such as income support or child tax credits, and who are looking after young children.\n\nDiscounts for this group may be limited so customers are advised to contact their suppliers at the earliest opportunity. If you are in the core group but do not receive a letter about the discount by December 6 call the helpline \u2013 which opens tomorrow \u2013 0800 731 0214.", "description": "A vital scheme launches tomorrow that helps elderly people meet the cost of energy bills every winter, known as the Warm Home Discount.", "authors": ["Laura Shannon For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
