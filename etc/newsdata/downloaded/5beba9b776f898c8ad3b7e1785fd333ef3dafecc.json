The House Intelligence Committee, chaired by California Democrat Adam Schiff, is running the meetings, but the investigation also includes the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as well as the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nThe depositions are run by committee staff. Members of Congress from these three committees are invited to attend and observe, but only staff are asking the questions.\n\nRep.

A parliamentarian who interprets congressional rules was consulted and concurred that Gaetz could not attend.\n\nGaetz later complained on Twitter about the movement of the impeachment inquiry out of the Judiciary Committee, chaired by New York Democrat Jerry Nadler.\n\n\u201cJudiciary Chairman [Nadler] claimed to have begun the impeachment inquiry weeks ago,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow, his own Judiciary members aren\u2019t even allowed to participate in it.\u201d\n\nNadler\u2019s Judiciary Committee was indeed the hub of hearings aimed at Trump, especially as special counsel Robert Mueller conducted his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and then later obstructed justice.\n\nBut as Congress returned to Washington in September after the August recess, the center of gravity was already shifting away from Nadler and toward the three other committees. Yahoo News reported this \u201cshift to Schiff\u201d on Sept. 24.\n\nOn Sept. 9, the Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees together sent letters to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about their concerns that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had \u201cacted outside legitimate law enforcement and diplomatic channels to coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically motivated investigations under the guise of anticorruption activity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz addresses the media on Capitol Hill on Monday.

But the whistleblower also spoke with staff at Schiff\u2019s Intelligence Committee before filing his complaint, so it\u2019s possible that staff at Oversight and Foreign Affairs sent their Sept. 9 letters with that information in mind.\n\nThe letters came from Oversight and Foreign Affairs because Oversight has jurisdiction for the executive branch and Foreign Affairs has jurisdiction over the State Department. The intelligence community has jurisdiction over itself, and since the whistleblower is a member of the intelligence community, it was a straightforward process for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to make Schiff the new point person.", "description": "When Republican congressman Matt Gaetz tried to attend an impeachment inquiry deposition Monday morning in the U.S. Capitol, he ran smack into the often arcane and confusing rules of Congress.
