The global benchmark rose nearly 1% on Thursday and is heading for a weekly gain of more than 3%.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was down 26 cents, or 0.5%, at $55.97. The U.S. benchmark rose 0.5% in the previous session and is on track for a weekly gain of 4.1%.\n\nThe strong weekly rise in oil prices was underpinned by a surprise decline in U.S. inventories of crude and optimism about more efforts to support prices by OPEC and its allies.\n\nYet, on the whole, economic growth and oil demand concerns continue to be a key driver of prices.\n\nEconomists in a Reuters poll said a steeper decline in global economic growth remains more likely than a synchronised recovery, even as multiple central banks dole out rounds of monetary easing.\n\nAnother Reuters poll of economists found the recent truce in the U.S.-China trade war is not an economic turning point and has done nothing to reduce the risk that the United States could slip into recession in the next two years.\n\n\u201cThe recent slowdown in U.S. data has resurrected talk of U.S. growth \u2018catching down\u2019 to the rest of the world,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets in a note to clients.\n\nThere was also more bad news for European powerhouse Germany, with a survey showing employment in the nation\u2019s private sector fell for the first time in six years in October, suggesting that a third-quarter slowdown could stretch into the closing months of the year.\n\nThursday\u2019s oil price rally was driven by data showing U.S. inventories dropped by 1.7 million barrels last week, shattering analysts\u2019 expectations for an increase of 2.2 million barrels.
