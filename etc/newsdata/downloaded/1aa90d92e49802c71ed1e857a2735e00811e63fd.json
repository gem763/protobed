But prices are also falling for American exporters such as farmers.\n\nThe import price index fell by 0.5% last month, the government said Friday. Over the past year import prices have dropped 2%.\n\nIf fuel is excluded, import prices were unchanged in August.\n\nRead: For the first time in 11 years, 80% of Americans in their prime are working\n\nWhat happened: The cost of imported oil sank almost 5% in August. Prices also declined for food and feeds as well as industrial supplies.\n\nThe cost of most other imports were little changed.\n\nThe cost of imports from China have slipped 1.5% over the past year as the country tries to cope with stiff U.S. tariffs. Yet the decrease is not enough to prevent Americans from paying more for electronics, appliances and other products that largely come from China once the tariffs are applied at U.S. ports.\n\nU.S. export prices, meanwhile, fell by 0.6% last month.\n\nFarm crops saw a 2.5% decline, reflecting lower demand from foreign customers amid the festering trade war with China and a slowing global economy.\n\nBig picture: The U.S. isn\u2019t importing much inflation from abroad, but it\u2019s a different story at home.\n\nAfter a prolonged bout of surprising low inflation, domestic prices appear to be rising. Both wholesale and consumer inflation increased in August, with one key measure of prices matching an 11-year high.\n\nRead: Inflation\u2019s slow burn getting a little hotter, CPI shows\n\nInflation is still quite low, however, and doesn\u2019t appear to be a big threat to the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve is more worried about the damage caused by the trade war with China. That\u2019s why it\u2019s expected to cut already low U.S. interest rates next week.\n\nRead: U.S. consumers are far from spent and that\u2019s a lifesaver for a wobbly economy\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201cBasically, don\u2019t look for imports (pre-tariff) to add to inflation,\u201d wrote Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. \u201c On the export side, the trade-war battered farm sector saw its export prices fall sharply once again.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.18% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.04% were mixed in Friday trades. Stocks have been rising in anticipation of the Fed cutting interest rates. Talk of a potential truce of sorts in the U.S.-China trade war has also helped.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +5.97% rose to 1.83%, extending a recent upturn. The yield had fallen below 1.5% just a few weeks ago.", "description": "The cost of imported goods fell sharply in August owing to a decline in petroleum prices, indicating the U.S. is facing little price pressures from abroad.", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GM471_import_ZG_20180713082425.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
