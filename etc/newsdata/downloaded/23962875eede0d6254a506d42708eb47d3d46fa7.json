Students Must Submit Speeches, Swear Oath to School", "language": "en", "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nAnyone who delivers a speech at an event hosted by the school district in Appleton, Wisconsin must submit the speech in advance and then swear under oath they will not deviate from the script. And that includes students.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to speak at a school event is a privilege, not a right,\u201d the Appleton Area School District wrote in a statement. \u201cThese guidelines do not restrict or regulate individual speech or expression. However, individual speech and expression may still be subject to other restrictions or limitations that are imposed by law or that the District may lawfully enforce through other policies, rules or practices.\u201d\n\nThe new regulations were implemented after a Christian school board member invoked the name of Jesus Christ during a graduation ceremony last June.\n\nRev. Alvin Dupree told students to \u201cnever succumb to the pressure of being politically correct,\u201d the Post Crescent reported. He also changed the district\u2019s prepared statement of \u201cbest wishes\u201d to \u201cGod bless.\u201d\n\nThe new guidelines require all speakers, including students, to submit their entire speech in writing two weeks in advance of delivery.\n\nFirst Liberty Institute, one of the nation\u2019s leading religious liberty law firms, told Starnes Media they stand ready to assist any students who become targets of hostility because of their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cStudents who earn the right to address their peers are free to reference their faith as a part of those remarks,\u201d First Liberty Institute attorney Jeremy Dys told Starnes Media. \u201cAny school district that requires students to submit their speeches for pre-approval must be careful they do not force students to secularize their private remarks to satisfy government censors.\u201d\n\nSpeakers are also not permitted to wear \u201cjewelry, clothing or accessories that reasonably could be understood to communicate a message to the audience when the speech is given.\u201d\n\nDoes that mean students will be banned from delivering a speech if they are wearing a cross necklace or a t-shirt that references the Almighty?\n\nBut the swearing of an oath is perhaps the most disturbing part of Appleton\u2019s crackdown on free speech.\n\n\u201cSpeakers that submit proposed speeches shall be required to certify that they will deliver the speech as written, except for minor and immaterial variances from the text of their proposal,\u201d the district wrote. \u201cCertification shall be in writing and shall be sworn under oath.\u201d\n\nI wonder if they are going to make folks swear that oath on a copy of the Holy Bible or a copy of Saul Alinsky\u2019s \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d?\n\nThe oath must be signed by student and adult speakers and must be witnessed and sealed by a Notary.\n\nThe oath states, among other things, \u201cthat I am affirming the statements to be true and correct under penalty of law.\u201d\n\nFirst Liberty\u2019s Dys blasted the school district\u2019s draconian speech oath.\n\n\u201cThe only oath these school officials should require of anyone is that they uphold the First Amendment to the US Constitution,\u201d he told Starnes Media.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, an organization that targets and bullies Christians, praised the school district\u2019s crackdown on free speech.\n\n\u201cWe think the district did the right thing,\u201d FFRF attorney Ryan Jayne told the newspaper. \u201cWe expect there won\u2019t be any problems with (Rev.) Dupree speaking at district events in the future, because under these guidelines we don\u2019t expect that he\u2019ll be allowed to speak.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the point the school district is trying to make. Their new policies and procedures are meant to silence people of faith \u2013 specifically Christians.\n\nAs I wrote in my new book, \u201cCulture Jihad: How to Stop the Left From Killing a Nation,\u201d many of our public schools have been turned into indoctrination centers for leftwing propaganda. Every freedom-loving American should be appalled by the actions of the Appleton Area School District.\n\nHeaven forbid the day comes when an American teenager or a pastor is dragged off the stage by security forces simply for uttering the name of Jesus Christ at a graduation ceremony.\n\nTodd Starnes is president of Starnes Media Group and host of \u201cTodd Starnes News & Commentary,\u201d a daily radio commentary heard nationally on hundreds of radio stations.
