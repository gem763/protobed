'Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation, and committed impeachable acts.'\n\nTrump slapped back, 'So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice! '\n\nBiden was quick to counterpunch. He thanked Trump for watching his address and called on his political opponent to go public with decades of sheltered taxes.\n\n'Thanks for watching. Stop stonewalling the Congress. Honor your oath. Respect the Constitution. And speaking of taxpayers, I\u2019ve released 21 years of my tax returns. You?' he tweeted.\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden went head to head on impeachment on Wednesday, with the latter claiming the sitting president had committed criminal acts and the former calling his wannabee replace 'pathetic'\n\nTrump appeared to be watching Biden's speech in real time - just after the Democratic presidential candidate finished an hour of remarks he took a slap at him\n\nBiden had berated Trump at a Rochester, New Hampshire, event for imploring Ukraine and China to investigate he and his son Hunter for alleged corruption.\n\nThe former vice president said it was 'wrong' and 'un-American' and characterized it as attempted election interference.\n\n'As Americans, it offends every bone in our body. The ballot box is sacred ground in America,' he said. 'It's not complicated, it's called democracy. We believe Americans should decide American elections, period.'\n\nTrump, he said, not not agree, apparently. 'But Donald Trump will do anything to get reelected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy.\n\n'It's stunning, and it's dangerous, because it directly threatens our democracy,' he said. 'No president in American history has ever dared to engage in such unimaginable behavior.'\n\nBiden said that Trump has already indicted and convicted himself of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n'To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,' he added, calling it obvious. 'Impeachment isn't only about what the president has done, it's about the threat the president poses, if allowed to remain in office.'\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate proceeded to cast Trump as a storybook-villain who lures innocent civilians into illegal schemes.\n\n'He is seeing no limit to his power, regardless of what the Constitution says. He believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs. He is even willing to hold Congress and congressionally-appropriated aid to a foreign nation hostage to his personal political demands.\n\n'He believes if he does something, it\u2019s legal, period. And perhaps most importantly, he believes there is nothing we can do about it. He believes that he can and will get away with anything he does,' Biden said.\n\nThe presidential candidate said to loud applause that Trump is 'shooting holes in the Constitution,' and he cannot be allowed to get way with it..\n\n'This is a president who has decided that this nation doesn\u2019t have the tools or the power or the political will to stop him from doing whatever he wants. Trump isn\u2019t just testing us. He is laughing at us.'\n\nShouting, angrily, Graham said, 'He has no sense of decency. He doesn\u2019t care about the law. He believes that people \u2014 and nations \u2014 that follow the rules are anything other than suckers, or fools or losers. We have to prove him wrong.'\n\n'He'll stop at nothing to same himself,' Biden asserted.\n\nAfter he'd dressed Trump down for a solid twenty minutes, Biden said that none of the president's attacks are true, therefore he plans to stay focused on voters' problems.\n\nThe president responded with a tweet calling him 'Sleepy Joe Biden!' and television ad his campaign is running that accuses him of corruption.\n\nTrump had spent his Wednesday morning rage-tweeting about House Democrats' impeachment investigation, which he insists is a 'scam' meant to sink his reelection bid.\n\nHis public schedule otherwise empty, the president appeared to be reviewing and responding to coverage of his White House's announcement it would not be complying with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked the anonymous whistle-blower who brought conduct Democrats say could be criminal to light.\n\nIn defiance of federal laws intended to protect such a person's identity, he claimed that 'he or she should be exposed and questioned properly' in one of his first tweets of the day.\n\n'The so-called Whistleblower, before knowing I was going to release the exact Transcript, stated that my call with the Ukrainian President was \u201ccrazy, frightening, and completely lacking in substance related to national security.\u201d This is a very big Lie. Read the Transcript! he said in his latest attempt to undermine the impeachment probe's star witness.\n\nTrump claimed that Pelosi and her caucus are 'Con Artists, only looking to hurt the Republican Party and President' before demanding that she apologize and 'stop this ridiculous impeachment!'\n\n'Their total focus is 2020, nothing more, and nothing less,' he charged. 'The good news is that WE WILL WIN!!!!\n\nThe White House told Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Donald Trump and his staff would not be participating in her impeachment inquiry\n\nTrump paired up with his son, Don Jr., to attack his congressional critics.\n\nThe younger Donald Trump remained in New York to help run his father's business. Even before impeachment inquiry launched, though, he had been devoting his Twitter feed to defending his president father.\n\nAfter the whistle-blower was revealed to have had 'some type of professional relationship with one of the Democratic candidates,' the president's son erupted.\n\n'It\u2019s good that this partisan hit job is coming to light but based on the bulls*** of the last 3 years did anyone really not see this coming from moment one???' he said in a tweet the president, who's begun publicly cursing at his accusers, shared with his following.\n\nThe president went on to assault the House Intelligence Committee chairman, over an admission that his committee was contacted by the whistle-blower before the unidentified intelligence operative lodged a formal complaint.\n\n'Adam Schiff is a disgrace to our Country!' he said of the California Democrat he believes is lying to further the investigation.\n\nSchiff says has not had personal contact with the whistle-blower. All arrangements have been made through staff or through the whistle-blower's attorneys. Trump alleges that Schiff's conduct is treasonous and he ought to be removed from office.\n\nThe White House told Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday that Donald Trump and his staff would not be participating in her 'illegitimate' impeachment inquiry because it amounted to an illegal attempt to overturn the 2016 election.\n\n'Put simply, you seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen,' White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to the speaker and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engle, who are overseeing the inquiry.\n\nThe scathing, eight-page missive, was tantamount to a declaration of political war.\n\nIn the letter, Cipollone argued the president and his administration 'reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process' and would not cooperate with subpoena requests.\n\n'Your unprecedented actions have left the President with no choice,' he wrote. 'In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.'\n\nCipollone danced around the issue of a full House vote on an impeachment inquiry, stopping short of directly calling for one, because the GOP would likely lose in the Democratic-controlled chamber and some Republican lawmakers would be uneasy about being put in the politically tough spot of having to go on the record.\n\nHe also hinted the administration would become more cooperative if Democrats dropped the formal impeachment inquiry and returned to 'regular order.'\n\n'If the Committees wish to return to the regular order of oversight requests, we stand ready to engage in that process as we have in the past, in a manner consistent with well-established bipartisan constitutional protections and a respect for the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution,' he wrote.\n\nBut Pelosi outlined her stance in a letter to fellow Democrats before she received the White House missive, making it clear the impeachment inquiry will go forward.\n\nShe also charged the president with obstruction of justice - a charge Democrats see as an impeachable offense - and said the Constitution gives the lawmakers the authority to continue their investigation.\n\n'As President Trump is obstructing justice, abusing power and diminishing the office of the presidency, we have a responsibility to strengthen the institution in which we serve. This is essential if we are to honor the separation of powers which is the genius of the Constitution,' the speaker wrote earlier Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe White House pushed back on the Democrats' obstruction argument.\n\n'That's a political argument, not a legal argument,' a senior administration official said on a call with reporters.\n\nThe White House letter reads more like a political argument than a legal one. It's filled with provocative, fiery language, and hurls insults at some of the key Democratic players in the impeachment process.\n\nCipollone outlines a series of demands from the White House, including presenting evidence, calling witnesses, having White House counsel at all hearings, and letting them cross-examine the witnesses.\n\nHe also requests, on behalf of Republican lawmakers, the power to subpoena witnesses.\n\nThat power belongs to the majority party in Congress. Democrats, for example, could not use it when Republicans controlled the chamber.\n\nCipollone also argues \u2018your inquiry is constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process\u2019 because the full House did not vote on proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\n\nHowever, he stops short of blatantly calling for such a vote.\n\nBut senior administration officials did not tell reporters which or all of their demands would need to be met to ensure the president's and his staff's cooperation with Democrats.\n\nCipollone does not have much of a legal leg to stand on in his requests. Article I on the Constitution gives the House of Representatives 'the sole Power of Impeachment.'\n\nHis letter also echoes some of the political attacks President Trump has made in his own defense, particularly in its attacks on Schiff.\n\nCipollone attacked Schiff for his opening statement at a hearing last month that mocked the president's phone conversation with the president of the Ukraine, a move Trump has railed against and argued Schiff should be arrested for treason for doing.\n\nHe also cited a report that the whistle-blower who first drew attention to the contents of the president's call reached out to staff on the Intelligence committee on how to proceed.\n\nAnd he threw out some political red meat in his chewing out of the Democrats.\n\n'The effort to impeach President Trump \u2014 without regard to any evidence of his actions in office \u2014 is a naked political strategy that began the day he was inaugurated, and perhaps even before,' Cipollone wrote.\n\nThe letter from the White House counsel echoed President Trump's political attacks on Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone included political red meat in his scathing letter to Democrats on impeachment\n\nThe administration vowed last week to send Pelosi a letter arguing the president can ignore Democrats' demands for witnesses and documentation in their impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi argues the blessing of the full House isn't necessary for Democrats to proceed in their inquiry.\n\nThere 'is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,' she told House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy in a letter last week after he urged her to hold a vote in the full House.\n\nGiven that Pelosi's party holds the majority in the chamber, such a measure would be expected to pass.\n\nBut Republicans could be concerned about support slipping among their own lawmakers.\n\nPelosi has made such an argument.\n\n'There's some Republicans that are very nervous about our bringing that vote to the floor,' she said a press conference on Capitol Hill last week.\n\nPolls indicate support among Americans - and slowly among Republicans - is building for the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll out Tuesday showed 28 per cent of Republicans support the inquiry, a new high.\n\nAnd some GOP lawmakers, like Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada, have indicated an openness to the inquiry, saying Congress should follow the facts in the case. Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan said there are 'legitimate questions' about Trump's request of the Ukrainian president in their July 25 phone call.\n\nA vote now on an impeachment inquiry could lock in GOP lawmakers to the president's side before further cracks in support show up.\n\nAnd it would force them on the record at a time many of them have remained silent about the president's predicament.\n\nThere is talk that, privately, not all Republicans are on the president's side.\n\nFormer Arizona Senator Jeff Flake claimed 'at least 35' Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump - if they could do it on a secret ballot.\n\n'I heard someone say if there were a private vote there would be 30 Republican votes,' he told the Texas Tribune Festival last month. 'That's not true. There would be at least 35.'\n\nThe president does have his public supporters though. McCarthy and Republican lawmaker Jim Jordan have been vocal and public in their backing the president.\n\n'You have a speaker of the House that said we need to strike while the iron is hot and the chairman of the committee who is so bias against this president,' Jordan complained on Tuesday in the Capitol of Pelosi and Schiff.\n\nThe resistance movement by the Trump administration has already started when the president directed Gordon Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, not to testify before lawmakers on Tuesday.\n\nA series of text messages released by the House Intelligence Committee last week place Sondland at the center of talks involving the Ukrainians, U.S. diplomats, and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe White House has played hardball with Democrats, forbidding EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland from testifying before lawmakers\n\nLawmakers wanted to speak to him about the texts and about additional texts and emails they claim are in his possession.\n\nHouse Democrats, in response, vowed to subpoena Sondland.\n\nIf the Trump administration directs him to ignore the subpoena, the matter is likely to end up in the courts.", "description": "Donald Trump and Joe Biden went head-to-head on impeachment Wednesday, Biden said Trump committed criminal acts.
