REUTERS/Darren Ornitz\n\nThe New York Times on Monday reported Trump had asked Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for help investigating the origins of what became Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s efforts to aid Trump in the 2016 national elections.\n\nA spokesperson for Morrison on Tuesday said the prime minister had agreed to help, drawing criticism from Australia\u2019s opposition Labor party.\n\nBut Payne said cooperating with Australia\u2019s closest ally was prudent.\n\n\u201cWe are working in Australia\u2019s interests and we are working with our closest and most important ally,\u201d Payne told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\n\u201cWe should assist them as we can, we should ensure that assistance is appropriate and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nTrump is under mounting pressure amid an impeachment investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives into reports that he sought to influence foreign governments to go after his political adversaries.\n\nThe Democratic-led House began the inquiry last week after a whistleblower raised concerns that Trump tried to leverage nearly $400 million in proposed aid for Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nThe Mueller report was triggered in part by former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer.\n\nDowner was allegedly told in 2016 by George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign aide, that Russia had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nDowner reported the details of the conversation, which Papadopoulos denies, to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.", "description": "Australia's offer to help U.S. President Donald Trump investigate a report into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was in the national interest, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436059402&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF91003", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
