After racing out to a 5-0 lead in the deciding set, Gauff dropped two late games to Ostapenko before closing out the match.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "American teenager Coco Gauff won her first WTA title by beating Jelena Ostapenko 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 to capture the Upper Austria Ladies on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/upper_austria_ladies_tennis_54924_c0-100-4530-2742_s1200x700.jpg?1adf6a8da46ad0afead743f94bacb3d3845db21d", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
