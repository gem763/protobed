Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching,\u201d Father Robert Morey told local media on Monday, confirming he had refused the Democratic presidential hopeful the sacrament during Sunday Mass at Saint Anthony\u2019s Catholic Church in Florence.\n\nI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers.\n\nAlso on rt.com Hillary Clinton thinks \u2018God put her on earth\u2019 to be president, former Bill Clinton adviser says\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign office didn\u2019t comment on the snub, nor would it confirm their boss was at Father Morey\u2019s mass, insisting that, if he was, he\u2019d been there in a \u201cprivate capacity.\u201d Instead, it directed the conversation to the candidate\u2019s appearance at a Baptist church in nearby Hartsville later that day \u2013 where, presumably, he\u2019d received a warmer welcome.\n\nNotably, Biden is Catholic, so one could argue that the priest giving him a cold shoulder couldn\u2019t have been a pleasant experience.\n\nThe former Delaware senator\u2019s position on abortion has vacillated significantly over the years, depending on who he\u2019s talking to. While he stated in 2012 that he does not personally support abortion, he claimed he didn\u2019t want to impose his beliefs on others, and has more recently said he supports codifying the rights granted by the Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the US in 1973.\n\nIn June, his campaign revealed that he supported the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the mother\u2019s life. But just a few days later \u2013 perhaps realizing he was the sole candidate in the crowded Democratic field who backed the amendment, which is also supported by Trump \u2013 he disavowed it.\n\nAlso on rt.com Anti-Trump MSNBC host gets destroyed on Twitter for implying \u2018lock him up!\u2019 is a bit much\n\nRather than iron out his positions on thorny issues, Biden has lately focused much of his energy on a less controversial subject \u2013 attacking President Donald Trump. Since Sunday\u2019s snub, he has called Trump \u201can idiot\u201d for not believing in yet-to-be-proven Russian election interference. \u201cEverybody knows\u201d it exists, Biden pleaded with 60 Minutes, in an interview that aired on Sunday.\n\nBiden has also accused the incumbent president of having \u201cno idea\u201d about the struggles of the working class and vowed to \u201cmake Donald Trump a one-term president.\u201d\n\nThe former VP maintains a lead in polls among voters in South Carolina, an early primary state, though he has slipped to third place in New Hampshire.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
