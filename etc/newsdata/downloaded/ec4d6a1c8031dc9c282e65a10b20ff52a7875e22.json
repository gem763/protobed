Despite snatching a second term from the jaws of defeat, the Conservatives have inched ahead as the most popular party in Canada among voters, at 34.4 per cent \u2013 1.4 per cent more than the Liberals.\n\nSo we should not be too sanguine about the fact that the far-right People's Party of Canada thankfully failed to win any seats at all. Although the right is on the back foot, if Trudeau fails to deliver on the lifeline he has been granted by a disgruntled electorate, Canada\u2019s liberal parties will become unelectable, handing the reins of power over to Andrew Scheer (or worse) in four years.\n\nTo avoid this outcome, Trudeau has to fix the ineffectiveness and double standards in his administration. There is an urgent lesson here for progressive parties around the world, and it is this: winning the election is just the beginning \u2013 the bigger challenge is reforming democracy itself.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis year saw voter turnout dip to 66 per cent, below the record-breaking turnout that propelled Trudeau to power. This growing disillusionment among Canadians is less about any particular party or person, and more about the economic landscape.\n\nSince 1980, incomes have more than doubled for the top 1 per cent, but shrank for the bottom half, making them reliant on state handouts just to stay afloat.\n\nLast year, there were just 10,840 \u201cultra-wealthy\u201d people in Canada \u2013 defined as those with $30 million or more in assets. This is up by 14 per cent from the previous year. Their collective wealth is worth a colossal $1.2 trillion dollars \u2013 that\u2019s equivalent to 70 per cent of Canada\u2019s entire GDP. While the rich are getting richer, ordinary Canadians as a whole saw their net worth in the same period shrink by 0.2 per cent.\n\nTime and again, Trudeau has promised to ensure that the ultra-rich are taxed effectively, with the money spent appropriately on improving the lives of most Canadians. But it just isn\u2019t happening, in no small measure because Canadian civil servants are among the most highly paid in the world, yet operate with little accountability or transparency.\n\nInstead, corporate executives still benefit from a 50 per cent lower tax rate by channelling their wealth through stock options, and Trudeau has backed billions in corporate tax breaks at the expense of the taxpayer.\n\nHe fired his female indigenous Attorney General and another outstanding minister, reportedly for trying to speak out about his aims to cut a deal with a company facing corruption charges. And while paying lip-service to climate action, he exempted up to 80 per cent of the worst Canadian polluters from his flagship carbon tax.\n\nMeanwhile, his social programmes are geared toward generating big profits for private finance, rather than delivering key services like childcare and affordable housing. His proposed plan to fix Canada\u2019s healthcare system looks like hot air, ignoring as it does the highest state-paid physicians in the world. And the most vulnerable people in Canada are consistently overlooked by Trudeau\u2019s government \u2013 when the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled that First Nation people should be compensated for the government\u2019s gross discrimination against indigenous children and families, Trudeau\u2019s response was to fight it.\n\nIt would be a mistake to assume that such problems are somehow unique to Trudeau. Far from it \u2013 they have been worsening decade by decade under both Conservative and Liberal administrations. The difference is that by promising something different, but choosing not to deliver it, the Liberals are forcing voters to look elsewhere for answers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Those who sell authoritarian fantasies of a return to the \u201cgood old days\u201d will inevitably find more traction within the ruins of Liberal collapse.\n\nSo unless Trudeau fixes the fundamental flaws at the heart of Canadian democracy \u2014 which thus far he has shown little interest in \u2014 we are witnessing the beginning of the end of Canada\u2019s liberal honeymoon. The lessons for progressives around the world are palpable.\n\nDr. Saqib Qureshi is a senior business strategist and expert on democratic policy development who has advised governments in Canada, London, Washington DC and Dubai.
