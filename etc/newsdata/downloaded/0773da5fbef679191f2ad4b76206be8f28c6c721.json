USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Given another chance to close out a championship for his team, Justin Verlander came up short once again in the World Series.\n\nAfter surrendering a fifth-inning lead by giving up a pair of solo homers to Adam Eaton and Juan Soto in the Washington Nationals\u2019 7-2 Game 6 victory, Verlander is now 0-6 in with a 5.68 ERA in seven career World Series starts.\n\nOnly one pitcher, Whitey Ford with eight, has lost more World Series decisions than Verlander. And Ford had 10 Fall Classic victories to his credit.\n\nVerlander, who led the American League with 21 wins, lost Game 6 of the World Series for the second time in three years. His Astros teammates, most notably Charlie Morton, bailed him out in beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 7 of the 2017 Series.\n\n\"I thought we didn't talk about record anymore,\" Verlander joked after the game. \"Hey, there's been some good games mixed in with some not-so-good ones. I can't point a finger to anything in particular. I'm going out there and trying my best. Just wasn't able to come away with a win.\"\n\nJustin Verlander looks down after a solo home run by Nationals right fielder Adam Eaton.

The Tampa Bay Rays beat him in Game 4 of the ALDS and he lost to the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the ALCS with the Astros leading 3-1 and the chance to put away the series.\n\nDating back to 2017, Verlander has now lost four straight series-clinching playoff games, the longest streak in major league history.\n\nSERIES TIED: Strasburg's stellar outing sets up dramatic Game 7\n\nYOU'RE OUT: Controversial call gets manager ejected in Game 6\n\nVerlander came into Game 6 of the World Series against the Nationals with the chance to secure Houston's second title in three years, but Washington fought back to even the series, forcing a dramatic Game 7.\n\nFor the third straight postseason start, Verlander allowed a run in the first-inning. Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon drove in Trea Turner to give Washington an early lead. Verlander has surrendered eight home runs this postseason. That ties Clayton Kershaw in 2017 for the most homers allowed in any single postseason, leaving a vexing hole in his resume.\n\nVerlander, 36, has a World Series ring, MVP and Cy Young Award to his credit, along with three no-hitters.\n\nYet, a personal \"W\" in the World Series has eluded him.\n\n\"Hopefully I get another opportunity,\" he said.\n\nMaybe out of the bullpen in Game 7 on Wednesday?\n\n\"It's a Game 7 \u2013 all hands on deck,\" Verlander said. \"If (manager A.J. Hinch) asks, I'm sure I'll figure out a way.\"", "description": "Houston's veteran ace picked up his sixth loss in seven career World Series starts as Astros drop Game 6 vs. Nationals.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
