U.S. Army / Sgt. Trey Harvey\n\nTrump intended to hold separate meetings with President Ghani and the Taliban at Camp David, after which the US president would have the prime opportunity to showcase the new relationship, according to The Times.\n\nOther issues were raised in the days leading up to the Taliban's trip. Afghan officials reportedly said they objected to releasing thousands of Taliban prisoners, which the US had agreed to.\n\nOn Thursday, the potential trip was nixed after Trump was informed of a suicide car bomb in Afghanistan which killed US Army Sgt. 1st Class Elis Angel Barreto Ortiz Ortiz, as well as a Romanian soldier and at least 10 civilians. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nTrump and his aides came to an agreement that the Camp David trip \u2014 which would have been held three days before the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks \u2014 could not be conducted after the car bomb attack, The Times said.\n\n\"This is off; we can't do this,\" Trump said to officials, according to the article.\n\nAfghan officials reportedly seemed unaware of the change because the White House did not make a formal announcement.\n\nTrump would later announce the cancellation of the trip on his Twitter account: \"Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, [the Taliban] admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people.\"\n\n\"I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations,\" Trump added. \"What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\"\n\nNews of the potential trip, which was first revealed through Trump's tweet, was widely condemned by lawmakers. Democrats and Republicans in Congress denounced the plan, particularly in light of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\"As we head into the anniversary of 9/11, I do not ever want to see those terrorists step foot in United States soil. Period,\" Republican Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida, a former US Army special forces soldier, said on Sunday.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on several television networks on Sunday to defend the plan and explain the rationale for the criticized trip.\n\n\"In the end, if you're going to negotiate peace, you often have to deal with some pretty bad actors,\" Pompeo said on ABC News's \"This Week.\"\n\n\"And I know the history, too, at Camp David. Indeed, President Trump reflected on that, we all considered as we were debating how to try and get to the right ultimate outcome.\"\n\n\"It was a place where we thought we could convince all the leaders of Afghanistan, President Ghani and his team, as well as the Taliban, we could convince them to begin to head in the direction that would create better conditions,\" Pompeo added. \"It's why the president was willing to go down that direction.\"", "description": "The Taliban's trip was reportedly embraced by Trump, but some National Security Council officials were not privy to the fluid developments.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d75b2682e22af5502628ef3-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
