He's easy to approach and easy to talk to. I think you need a manager like that.\n\n\"You can't think it's easy and you're just going to get there with your talent, because you need to work hard as well. I've seen a lot of people with talent but not everyone makes it because of the attitude and the drive.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBrewster also fondly recalls being a part of the squad that won Liverpool's sixth European Cup in Madrid in June, and says he hopes he can build on his appearance against MK Dons.\n\n\"No doubt making my debut away at MK Dons was amazing, I hope it's the first of many,\" Brewster added. \"The support of the fans was amazing, but being in Madrid was different.\"", "description": "The 19-year-old striker made his senior debut for the Reds in the Carabao Cup in September but has yet to feature in the Premier League", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Andrew Powell", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20731261.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Milton-Keynes-Dons-v-Liverpool-FC-Carabao-Cup-Third-Round.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
