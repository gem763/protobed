It\u2019s a deranged poem read by Audrey Lindemann, a University of Notre Dame undergraduate, who published a version of it recently in the Notre Dame campus newspaper. In the print version, she also denounces Sycamore Trust and Young Americans For Freedom.\n\nHere is the text of the audio on the clip:\n\nYour homophobic\n\ndiscourse soiled my\n\nair supply your ivory\n\ntower theology\n\nslit my loved ones\u2019\n\nthroats I\u2019m trying\n\nto go to class without\n\ndead friends in my\n\nbackpack just trying\n\nto touch my girl\u2019s shoulder\n\nin the grass you want\n\nto un-affirm me to\n\n\u201clobotomize me with a\n\ncrowbar\u201d well the murdered\n\ntrans angels (18 this year yet)\n\nleak brimstone into your\n\npraying mouths\n\nStudents for Child Oriented Policy\n\nIrish Rover\n\n(you say my piece had violent undertones that it drew hostile attention you say \u201cexpressing a Catholic viewpoint should not be equated to committing a heinous crime\u201d you contrasted your \u201creasoned opinion\u201d with my \u201cintellectual chaos\u201d that you are \u201ctargeted\u201d and I must respectfully say that the blood on your names did not come from you or the hate groups you\u2019ve been inviting to speak on campus. It was ours and my loved ones. Your reasoned opinions seep into churches, into culture, they diffuse like venomous gas from every outlet, this is the very nature of discourse. Your articles have directly affirmed violent lurkers online who would have us lobotomized with crow bars, thrown back into the closet, expelled from the school. Catholic writers feel like targets? Queer people have, since the beginning of time, flown around on wings made of bullseyes, a trans woman wakes up in a dorm of hundreds of men, a trans boy is kicked out of his home as a teenager and haunts the streets like a ghost a black trans woman is shot through the stomach with a gun a black trans woman is burned beyond recognition with only teeth left scattered in the sand and this has everything to do everything to do with the discoursal irresponsibility of privileged \u201cscholars\u201d like you. I respect your academic freedom I just ask that next time you type out an article from behind your thousand dollar mac book you taste a little iron in your mouth and maybe it\u2019s the blood of Dana Martin or Ashanti Cameron and maybe you feel dust in between your fingers and its the ashes of Bee Love Slater)\n\nthis is not scholarship it\u2019s a pained snarl\n\nfrom inside the dark wet belly of chaos\n\nand it\u2019s clawing at your cowardly pontification\n\nyou are nothing but a bullet\n\nat the gay massacre\n\nyou beat us in alleys you\n\nwatched us die of AIDS\n\nand yet I\u2019m here, laying\n\nwaste to your reproductive\n\nfuturism your procreative shackles\n\nI\u2019m here in class\n\nwith my gender on my\n\nsleeve and centuries of dead\n\nqueers in my old navy\n\nbackpack if you want me gone\n\ncome to my dorm room,\n\nyou are going to need\n\na backbone and better\n\nwords you are going to\n\nneed a much bigger\n\ncrowbar.\n\nI\u2019d say that Miss Lindemann has a Rich Inner Life\u2122. But if I were on Notre Dame\u2019s campus, and had been targeted by her with such malicious invective, and my image had been subject to a beating with a crowbar, I would be worried.\n\nCertainly Bill Dempsey, the head of Sycamore Trust, is concerned. Sycamore Trust is a group of ND alumni who seek \u201cCatholic renewal\u201d at the university. He wrote to Father John Jenkins, the school\u2019s president, today:\n\nDear Father Jenkins, The malignant poster recently displayed on campus and the venomous video that is posted on vimeo (http://tinyurl.com/y3tns4xe) surely must be major violations of the University\u2019s Standards of Conduct. In addition, they seem plainly to violate Indiana\u2019s \u201cintimidation law,\u201d which makes it a crime to incite violence or to take action intended to expose a person \u201cto hatred, contempt, disgrace, or ridicule.\u201d See Indiana Code Title 35. Criminal Law and Procedure \u00a7 35-45-2-1. The students\u2019 malicious and culpable intention is vividly evidenced on the poster by the perpetrators\u2019 circling in fake blood the names of student, faculty and alumni authors of Irish Rover and Observer \u201chomophobic\u201d articles upholding Church teaching, and on the video by one perpetrator repeatedly bashing the photos on the poster with a crowbar while another holds up a copy of The Irish Rover. In addition, the video leader assailed students associated with The Irish Rover and SCOP collectively, and in her Observer screed this morning she included students associated with Young Americans for Freedom and alumni associated with our organization, Sycamore Trust: \u201cleak brimstone into your\n\npraying mouths\n\nYoung Americans for Freedom\n\nChild Oriented Policy\n\nSycamore Trust\n\nIrish Rover\u201d This is beyond vile. It is provocative and dangerous. Rod Dreher is evidently the first to pick this up, but he certainly won\u2019t be the last. See \u201cAnti-Catholic Hate at Notre Dame\u201d http://tinyurl.com/yxnt8q87 . His conclusion: \u201cWhoever put this sign up slandered others at Notre Dame, attacked free speech, and is clearly trying to incite violence against them with that kind of incendiary rhetoric and symbolism. A line has been crossed. What is the university going to do about it?\u201d Since we are included as targets, we believe we have standing to ask precisely that question. We respectfully ask what you intend to do about it so that we can come to an informed judgment as to what we should do about it. As an immediate step, we strongly urge you to require the incendiary video be taken down. The longer it spews hatred, the more the risk of another Virginia Tech. Very truly, Bill Dempsey Chairman\n\nSycamore Trust\n\nAt about the 1:50 mark, a student in the background begins to beat with a crowbar the poster bearing images of Lindemann\u2019s opponents on campus. Here\u2019s a still:\n\nThis is spiritually dark stuff. \u201cLeak brimstone in your praying mouths\u201d?\n\nAt the University of Notre Dame.\n\nIf these were white supremacists threatening people of color with this kind of invective, Father Jenkins would know exactly what to do.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-4.19.40-PM-e1569964819584.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
