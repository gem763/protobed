But come up with something cool in economics and you might be memorialised with a law or a rule or a \u201ccurve\u201d.\n\nIntroducing the latest \u2013 the Sahm Rule. The architect of this rule, Federal Reserve economist and consumer section chief Claudia Sahm, came up with it to flag the onset of a recession faster than the current process that formally dates business cycles.\n\nIt also aims to be more dependable than some of the financial market metrics known to throw off false signals.\n\nIn a paper released earlier this year, Sahm said the unemployment rate can cut through all that. It is a widely used and easily understood statistic that captures why recessions matter. It also turns out that when the three-month average unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above the low of the previous year, the economy has just or is about to enter a period of contraction.\n\nIt has happened every time since the 1970s, Sahm noted when recommending her rule be used as a way to automatically trigger stimulus payments to households to help offset the sting of rising joblessness.\n\nThis could potentially shorten the recession as countries would not have to wait for politicians to sort through the data and vote on a stimulus package.\n\nA variety of such measures, totalling $420 billion (R6.4 trillion), were used to fight the most recent recession. Sahm\u2019s aim was to create a programme that would get the money rolling quickly, and keep it rolling until the economy stabilised.\n\nThe unemployment rule would identify a recession \u201cnearly immediately and long before it has been officially recognised\u201d, Sahm said at a seminar sponsored by the Washington Centre for Equitable Growth on proposals for fighting the next downturn.\n\nThe most recent recession, for example, began in December 2007, but the panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research, who date booms and busts, did not officially pinpoint that until a full year later.\n\nBy contrast, the Sahm Rule hit 0.53 in February 2008 and, under Sahm\u2019s proposal, benefits would have started to flow. It peaked at four and did not fall below 0.5 until June of 2010.\n\nWhile developed as part of a specific proposal for a new \u201cautomatic stabiliser\u201d, the Sahm Rule now appears destined for broader use.\n\nThe St Louis Federal Reserve last week added the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator to its massive Federal Reserve Economic Data (Fred) system, a popular and publicly accessible tool that offers everything from the number of jobs in Alabama to inflation in the UK since the early 1200s.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t even think to put \u2018series in Fred\u2019 on my bucket list \u2026 excellent,\u201d Sahm, a 2007 University of Michigan PhD graduate, said on Twitter alongside a photo of herself in a Fred T-shirt.\n\nNO RED FLAGS YET\n\nSahm\u2019s recession indicator is currently well below the level of concern, at just 0.07 percentage points. On average, it has been slightly negative since unemployment peaked and began falling in mid-2010, following the end of the deep 2007 to 2009 recession.\n\nBut it enters the Federal Reserve\u2019s lexicon at a time when debate is focused on the possible onset of a recession and under conditions that may test the rule\u2019s robustness.\n\nThe current unemployment rate of 3.7% is considered unnaturally low by many Federal Reserve officials. In fact, policymakers expect it to rise about half a percentage point without an actual contraction of GDP.\n\nThat rise is expected over several years, but, depending on how fast it happens, the Sahm Rule could be breached by a phase of sluggish growth \u2013 not the sort of downturn that she feels would warrant annual payments of several hundred dollars per individual until unemployment fell.\n\nUnlike the predictable return of comets or the stable characteristics of a species, economic \u201crules\u201d may be better characterised as guidelines that can shift over time.\n\nStanford University Professor John Taylor\u2019s Taylor Rule for setting interest rates described the Federal Reserve\u2019s behaviour well for a time, but is not considered so useful when central bank interest rates hit zero, as many have in recent years. Milton Friedman\u2019s Friedman Rule for growth in the money supply lost relevance when inflation and money dynamics changed. Even AW Phillips\u2019 famed Phillips Curve has lost favour as a practical measure of the trade-off between inflation and unemployment.\n\nWhether or not Sahm\u2019s rule works as advertised in the future, at least she is in good company. \u2013 Reuters", "description": "Astronomers get to name comets and biologists get to name species.
