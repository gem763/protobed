(Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney of Wisconsin slammed fellow Republicans on Tuesday for questioning the patriotism of witnesses for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\n\u201cQuestioning the patriotism, questioning the dedication to country of people like [National Security Council Adviser Lieutenant Colonel Alexander] Vindman\u2026and others who have testified\u201d is \u201cshameful,\u201d Cheney said during a news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation \u2026 It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process.\u201d\n\nVindman testified today that he believed Trump endangered national security by pressuring the President of Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden during a July 25 phone call. Vindman reported the conversation to the NSC\u2019s top lawyer as soon as it was finished.\n\nThe Lieutenant Colonel immigrated with his family at the age of three from Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, to the U.S. He is a decorated veteran who was wounded in combat during the Iraq War.\n\nCheney\u2019s comments appeared to rebut accusations made against Vindman on a Monday night Fox News panel.\n\n\u201cHere we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually, they spoke in English,\u201d host Laura Ingraham commented. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d\n\nPanelist John Yoo, who served as the deputy assistant U.S. attorney general for the Department of Justice\u2019s office of legal counsel under President George W. Bush, said he found Vindman\u2019s contacts with Ukrainian diplomats \u201castounding.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage,\u201d Yoo added.\n\nFormer Republican congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin suggested during a CNN interview on Tuesday that Vindman might have been moved to speak out against Trump\u2019s withholding of aid due to his affinity for his country of birth.\n\n\u201cHe has an affinity, probably, for his homeland,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cIt seems very clear that he is concerned for Ukrainian defense. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned for American policy, but his main mission was to make sure that the Ukraine [sic] got those weapons.\u201d\n\nSenator Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) expressed his shock at the comments against Vindman on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s despicable,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cThis is not normal. There\u2019s nothing normal about this.\u201d", "description": "Representative Liz Cheney slammed fellow Republicans on Tuesday for questioning the patriotism of witnesses for House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
