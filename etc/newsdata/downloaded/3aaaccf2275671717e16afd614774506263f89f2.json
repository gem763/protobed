It\u2019s a good week if I make $300.\u201d\n\nTip cuts, a mystifying new algorithmic pay system, and longer driving distances mean Carrico is working fewer hours for Instacart and making less money per hour, she said. And she\u2019s not alone. From Nov. 3 to 5, Instacart workers nationwide are going on strike to protest what they say are worsening working conditions. It comes on the heels of strikes by rideshare app drivers and unionization efforts by workers for food delivery apps across the world.\n\nThese gig workers don\u2019t have centralized factory floors where they can organize. Many can\u2019t even unionize in the U.S. because their companies classify them as contractors, not employees. But through a rolling series of strikes, these workers are determined to make the gig economy work for them.\n\nIt\u2019s an ad hoc labor movement, led by workers without formal unions. Sometimes that means trial-and-error protests as workers test their collective bargaining power. The upcoming Instacart strike will be at least the fourth time its workers have protested changes to the platform.\n\n\u201cSometimes we get what we want and sometimes we don\u2019t,\u201d Sarah Clarke, an Instacart shopper based in Silicon Valley, California said. \u201cThe first strike we ever did, for example, is when they completely removed tips. We did a strike and they were like, \u2018Fine, we\u2019ll add the tips back.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstacart works by letting customers order their groceries online or through an app. The company then matches the order with a nearby Instacart worker (called \u201cshoppers\u201d) who goes to the store, picks out groceries, and delivers them to the customer. But the company has continuously tinkered with its payment model since its 2012 founding. Where it used to pay workers 40 cents for each item on the grocery list, plus a delivery fee, now it computes payment by an algorithm, which some workers claim is deliberately opaque.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason for it,\u201d Sandra Wiggins, another Portland-based Instacart worker said. \u201cInstacart claims there\u2019s an algorithm that\u2019s used and it\u2019s a learning algorithm that takes into account all kinds of different factors including things like distance, time of day, the market, the items being shopped and whether they\u2019re difficult in some way\u2014because some items are more difficult than others, for example, picking out produce. There\u2019s a huge list of things that goes into how they compute a batch payment offer. Again, it doesn\u2019t really add up to something logical. It looks very arbitrary.\u201d\n\nWiggins, who typically shops with Instacart for about eight hours a week, said she\u2019d seen the upper range of her pay drop from about $250 a week to $160 since Instacart rolled out the algorithmic pay model. But strikes aren\u2019t always successful. When workers organized against the new pay structure, they won few victories.\n\n\u201cThe last one we had was when they totally fucked up our pay and switched everything around and got rid of the item commission and the batch incentive,\u201d Clarke said, referring to the per-item payment structure and a base delivery fee. \u201cWe gave them a list of I think seven reasons we were striking, and we pretty much didn\u2019t get any of them. This time we\u2019re going back to the basics of only asking for one thing.\u201d\n\nWhen Instacart workers go on strike in November, they\u2019ll be demanding the return of a 10-percent tip recommendation on the app. Previously, the app automatically suggested a 10-percent tip. Now it automatically recommends a 5-percent tip, with a $2 minimum\u2014and some Instacart workers say they\u2019re not even receiving that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen defaults come in at like $1.98 and I know darn well nobody is going in and typing $1.98 for a tip,\u201d Carrico said. \u201cPeople can be jerks but people aren\u2019t that cruel. So I don\u2019t think the default of 5 percent or $2 is consistent.\u201d\n\n\u201c From a material standpoint, we\u2019re scraping by on a fraction of what we used to make. \u201d \u2014 Vanessa Bain, Instacart worker\n\nVanessa Bain, a Silicon Valley-based Instacart worker who has seen her pay drop over nearly four years, said the new tipping recommendations have \u201cstarted conditioning their customers to tip less and less\u2026 From a material standpoint, we\u2019re scraping by on a fraction of what we used to make.\u201d\n\nAsked about the upcoming strike, Instacart said the company \u201ctake[s] the feedback of the shopper community very seriously and remain committed to listening to and using that feedback to improve their experience.\u201d\n\nInstacart\u2019s strike won\u2019t look quite like the ongoing strike of teachers in Chicago, or the recent strike by General Motors employees across the country.\n\nSince Instacart shoppers lack a centralized workplace, they plan to jam the Instacart app, Vice first reported. Depending on the risk workers are willing to take on, participating workers will either turn off their apps, cancel orders, or accept orders and then let them time out. Between the lack of shoppers on the platform, and the mass cancellations, Instacart workers hope to throw the app into disarray and pressure Instacart into restoring their old tipping policy.\n\nErik Loomis an associate professor of history at the University of Rhode Island, said the strategy might work, precisely because Instacart doesn\u2019t employee any full-time workers to replace the strikers.\n\n\u201cBecause these workers personally control so much of this Instacart system, by cancelling orders they can actually raise a lot of havoc, if they have a decent number of people,\u201d said Loomis, who studies American labor movements. \u201cGiving a company that kind of bad publicity very well may lead to a solution to this problem.\u201d\n\n\u201c Because these workers personally control so much of this Instacart system, by cancelling orders, they can actually raise a lot of havoc, if they have a decent number of people. \u201d \u2014 Professor Erik Loomis\n\nThe General Motors and Chicago teachers strikes were backed by unions, which many gig workers can\u2019t join because their companies do not classify them as full employees.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re organizing contractors, there\u2019s a fine line you\u2019re walking between what could be considered a violation of antitrust law and organizing,\u201d Bain said. \u201cI think it highlights our need for enhanced and greater workplace protection because these jobs really need to be organized. These platforms have engaged in what feels like perpetual warfare against their workers.\u201d\n\nThe lack of employee status can make protesting difficult, but not impossible, Loomis said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the only method of collective power,\u201d he said of traditional union-backed strikes. \u201cThere are, one might argue, some advantages to being outside that system of power because it frees you up. The things that restrict you under a traditional union election don\u2019t apply here.\u201d\n\nCertain demonstrations like sympathy strikes, for example, can land union workers in legal trouble, while non-unionized workers have more flexibility to protest.\n\nThe lack of a centralized workplace, like a school or a factory, has also forced app-based workers to innovate. Much of Instacart\u2019s upcoming strike has been organized through a Facebook group for Instacart workers across the country. Those strike plans then spread outward to smaller groups for Instacart workers in a specific region.\n\nBut not all Instacart workers are in the groups, which limits the organizing efforts. \u201cI think the count is 70,000 shoppers in the country (that\u2019s an old count) but there\u2019s only about 14,000 of us in the national group, so there are a lot that don\u2019t even know about this,\u201d Carrico said.\n\nTo spread information, strike participants are encouraged to follow the \u201cfive-person rule\u201d: tell five other Instacart shoppers about the upcoming protest. Carrico said she\u2019s taken to carrying flyers about the demonstration for other workers when she goes to the store.\n\nDrivers for Lyft and Uber have also relied on Facebook while coordinating strikes this year said Brian Dolber, an organizer with Rideshare Drivers United. The group helped organize a strike in April, and a particularly high-profile strike of Uber drivers the day before Uber\u2019s entry on the stock market this May.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is pioneered a hybrid digital and IRL approach to organizing,\u201d Dolber said \u201cBecause there is no real central location where drivers interact, we\u2019re working with an app developer.\u201d The group uses Facebook to reach out to drivers and direct them to its app where, in an inversion of how Uber and Lyft typically operate, drivers can strategize ways to stop work.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been an enormously helpful approach in bringing together an organization and having people interact in real life through meetings and ultimately organizing the strikes we built in the spring,\u201d Dolber said.\n\nA successful campaign will be a numbers game.\n\n\u201cIf everyone actually tells five people, then we know we\u2019re gold,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe know it\u2019ll work.\u201d\n\nCarrico estimated that approximately 75 percent of Instacart shoppers in her local Facebook group support the strike, \u201cbut there\u2019s enough people blowing back. And some of their concerns are valid. I understand the \u2018We want Instacart to pay more. This shouldn\u2019t be shoved off on customers,\u2019\u201d she said\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a valid argument, but the reality of our service industry culture is that employers\u2014or whoever it is that contracts us\u2014pays low and tipping is expected,\u201d she continued \u201cUntil we change that, fighting for it is kind of like swimming against the tide.\u201d\n\nBut Instacart workers won\u2019t know just how far their movement has spread until Nov. 3, when their colleagues across the country either put down the app or keep shopping.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna say 30,000 shoppers, if we\u2019re getting the word out properly,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cAnd most shoppers are not on the platform full-time, so it\u2019s a very hard number to pin down.\u201d\n\nShe paused.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you Instacart has it figured out.\u201d", "description": "Tip cuts and a mysterious new pay system have pushed Instacart \u201cshoppers\u201d to organize a strike through Facebook groups.", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571783155/191022-weill-gig-economy-tease_bgpydk", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
