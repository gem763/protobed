He is now devastated, sad. We spoke yesterday and Sunday night and this morning.\n\n\u201cHe trained normally with the group but he is devastated. He is sad about that situation.\n\n\u201cHis commitment is great every time. He wants to help. His behaviour was perfect in training, with the group and club. Really he knows he was wrong.\n\n\u201cHe feels inside, very deep. It\u2019s normal as a human. Every player needs the supporters\u2019 support.\n\n\"We are going through a difficult moment and it is our work and job to play under that pressure.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"The supporters are the most important.\n\n\"He is down and the most important is to look after him and his family and recover our best Granit Xhaka.\n\n\"After that wrong situation on Sunday, I have one challenge for myself and every player - when the supporters aren't happy, we need to show a better performance and result for them.\n\n\"If we do that, they will support us collectively and individually.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nShould he have apologised?\n\n\"Yes. I think when we make an individual mistake, we need to make an apology.\n\n\"That is what I prefer to do and what we suggested for him to do?\"\n\nShould we expect an apology?\n\n\"What is the most important, is that he is devastated. We need our family, our friends, our supporters to support and love us.\n\n\"He is not feeling that with the supporters.\n\n\"We are speaking with him, be close with your family and us, and we will try to be closer with our supporters.\n\n\"Little by little, it is a step we are taking in this moment.\"\n\n(Image: WILL OLIVER/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nIs he the right man to be captain?\n\n\"I explained why I selected him as that.\n\n\"He has those values, he has experience, he is captain of his national team has the conditions to be the captain.\n\n\"I decided that because the players respected that.\n\n\"He was wrong on Sunday and it wasn't the right response of a captain.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nWill he stay as captain?\n\n\"Step by step, first we will recover him, as a human and a player.\n\n\"Then we will speak about how we can improve and forward with him and the team.\n\n\u201cAt the moment I'm not speaking and I don't want to think about that.\"", "description": "Granit Xhaka reacted angrily when fans cheered his substitution during the draw with Crystal Palace on Sundaya", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Visionhaus", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Reuters", "Will Oliver Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750189.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
