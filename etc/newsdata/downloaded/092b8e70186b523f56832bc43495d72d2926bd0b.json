Tesco attributed most of the decline to subdued market growth in the UK and Ireland, especially in recent months, and to an unfavourable comparison with a year ago when sales were boosted by hot weather, the World Cup and the Royal Wedding.\n\nHowever, profits still rose strongly.\n\n\u201cThis is largely due to cost-cutting,\u201d said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a big blow for Tesco to lose Lewis ... It\u2019s hard to underestimate the impact Lewis has had on Tesco, as he turned the supertanker around after a run of poor results and an accounting scandal.\n\n\u201cKen Murphy has solid pedigree, coming from Walgreens Boots Alliance, a retailer that understands cost-cutting. He\u2019ll need to employ these skills at Tesco where he\u2019ll have to contend with tougher organic comparisons post the Lewis era. Moreover, the battle with the discounters is only just starting.\u201d\n\nLow-price supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are rapidly attracting new shoppers throughout the UK, threatening Tesco\u2019s dominance of the grocery market.\n\nTesco's shares fell when the market opened an hour after the announcement but later reversed losses, trading 1.7 per cent higher on the day by 9:15am.", "description": "The chief executive of Tesco, Dave Lewis, will step down next year in an unexpected decision he described as \u201cpersonal\u201d.
