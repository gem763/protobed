The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a conflict monitor based in Britain, put the toll at eight.\n\nTurkey's long-planned move to root out US-allied Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria could open a dangerous new front in Syria's eight-year-old war, pitting two US allies against each other and raising the spectre of sectarian bloodletting. Even before it began, it had set off fierce debates in Washington, with members of Congress accusing Trump of betraying the militia that fought beside the United States to defeat the Islamic State.\n\nThere were also concerns that the militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces, would shift its forces to the north to fight Turkey, creating a power vacuum elsewhere that could benefit President Bashar Assad of Syria, his Russian and Iranian allies, or the Islamic State.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, usually a staunch Trump ally, accused him of having \"shamelessly abandoned\" America's Kurdish allies, a move that \"ensures the re-emergence of ISIS,\" an alternative name for the Islamic State group.\n\nTrump has insisted that \"in no way have we abandoned the Kurds\", and Wednesday said he firmly opposed the operation.\n\n\"The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Turkey,\" he added, \"has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2014 and we will hold them to this commitment.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed back against the idea that Trump had given Turkey a green light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS forces pulled back from the border after \"it became very clear that there were American soldiers that were going to be at risk\", he said in an interview on PBS News Hour.\n\n\"The president,\" Pompeo added, \"made a decision to put them in a place where they were out of harm's way.\"\n\nThe United States withdrew 50 to 100 troops from the border area in advance of the operation, and US military officials said that the US was not providing assistance to either side. However, the United States was providing intelligence to Turkey until Monday that may have helped it target Kurdish forces.\n\nTurkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the operation was intended to \"prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border\". Turkey considers the militia a terrorist organisation linked to a Kurdish guerrilla movement.\n\nErdogan did not say how far into Syria that Turkish forces would go, but he has previously called for a Turkish-controlled buffer zone 30 kilometres deep into Syria and extending for hundreds of miles along the border.\n\n\"Turkey has no ambition in north-eastern Syria except to neutralise a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local population from the yoke of armed thugs,\" a government spokesman, Fahrettin Altun, wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post.\n\nThe attacks on Wednesday were broad, with strikes hitting in or near at least five towns along a stretch of more than 240 kilometres of the Syrian-Turkish border.\n\n\"There is a state of fear and terror among the people here, and the women and children are leaving the town,\" said Akrem Saleh, a local journalist reached by phone in Ras al Ain. Many men were staying home because they feared that Syrian rebels who accompanied the Turks would loot their homes if they were found empty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces warned of a \"possible humanitarian catastrophe\" because of the Turkish incursion.\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration that governs the area issued a call for \"general mobilisation\" to fight the Turks.\n\n\"We call upon our people, of all ethnic groups, to move toward areas close to the border with Turkey to carry out acts of resistance during this sensitive historical time,\" it said.\n\nMichael Maldonado, 31, a former Marine lance corporal from California who was among a handful of American volunteers fighting with the Kurds, said it did not matter to him that Turkey was a NATO ally.\n\n\"Ally or not, we are going to fight,\" he said in a phone interview from his position less than 30 kilometres from the Turkish border in eastern Syria. \"We see a strong country coming to massacre people who are just trying to live their lives, and we are going to try stop this. We feel we have no choice.\"\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Turkey launched a ground and air assault against a Syrian militia that has been a crucial US ally in the fight against the Islamic State, days after Donald Trump agreed to let the operation proceed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1477%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_107/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8887e1c03d74e9133642a70ad4a0321c79c7952b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
