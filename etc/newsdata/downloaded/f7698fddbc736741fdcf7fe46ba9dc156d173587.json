Poland is yet to decide on the way it will distribute frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Anna Koper; Editing by Deepa Babington)", "description": "Three of Poland's biggest private telecom firms have agreed to consider developing 5G networks with two state entities, one of the groups said on Monday, signaling the government may have some control over the future network.
