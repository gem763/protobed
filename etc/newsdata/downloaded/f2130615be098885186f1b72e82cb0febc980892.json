But I'm f**ked too.\" I didn't want to f**king phone the kid and tell him there's no hope.\n\n'You don't want me on that phone call! \"Hey, I know you're only 24 right now, but it can only get worse\" It is going to get f**king worse.\n\n'I'd take that phone call now. Yeah, but at that particular time, you don't want me on that phone call.'\n\nStressful: Zayn, now 26, left 1D in 2015 because of a desire to be a 'normal 22-year-old', a year before the group went on indefinite hiatus\n\nRobbie said has now found his 'purpose' in life after feeling like everything was about to 'fall apart'.\n\n'When I was hideously depressed and couldn't imagine getting on stage in front of a stadium full of people and thinking it was my job that was making me feel this way.' he said.\n\n'It was all about purpose. I retired \u2013 didn't tell anyone for three years, because I knew I was full of s**t \u2013 and in those three years I had no purpose and everything just started to fall apart.\n\n'My mind, my body, my groin, my knee, my back, f**king everything.\n\nBust-up: Robbie, who famously left Take That in 1995, said when Zayn reached out for tips on coping, he was unable to help because of his own troubles\n\nThrowback: Robbie's drug-taking marred his departure from Take That (Clockwise from top left, original members Jason Orange, Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen and Robbie)\n\n'And now I'm a 45-year-old man with three kids that has an amazing job. And that is purpose and I like it.'\n\nRobbie quit Take That five years after the band first found fame, and has been open about his history of drug use and alcohol abuse.\n\nCandid: Robbie made the comments in the new issue of GQ Hype\n\nThe group, made up of Robbie, Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen and Jason Orange, split shortly afterwards before reforming in 2006.\n\nRobbie briefly returned in 2010 to record album Progress.\n\nZayn rose to fame in One Direction alongside Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Nial Horan following their appearance on The X Factor in 2010.\n\nThe group garnered millions of fans across the world and four of their five albums reached number one in the charts.\n\nZayn's departure from the band came because of his desire to be a 'normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight'.\n\nAnd in 2018, the star said had not seen any of his former band mates in a 'long time' and that 'relationships had broken apart' by the time he left.\n\nHe told British Vogue: 'I ain't spoke to any of them for a long time, to be honest with you. That's just the way it is.\n\nMeteoric: Zayn rose to fame in One Direction alongside Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Harry Styles (from left to right)\n\n'There's things that happen and things that were said after I left. Snide things. Small things that I would never have expected...\n\n'People take it different ways - especially when there are five different personalities. The relationships had broken apart.'\n\nElsewhere in his candid interview with GQ Hype, Robbie discussed his feud with Liam Gallagher, which goes back two decades.\n\nQuizzed whether the Britpop star was on 'The List' of his enemies, Robbie exclaimed: 'Yeah, Liam's on The List. Yeah. And it's a long f**king list, you know?\n\n'When you go to a certain place for recovering alcoholics you have to write down a list of resentments. Mine was like f**king War And Peace...'\n\nLiam, 46, and started off as firm friends, having partied with the Oasis star's brother Noel at Glastonbury in 1995.\n\nSad: In 2018, the star said had not seen any of his former band mates in a 'long time' and that 'relationships had broken apart' by the time he left\n\nRobbie then famously fell out with the brothers, after Noel, 50, described him as 'that fat dancer from Take That.'\n\nAnd the bad blood continued in 2000, when Robbie challenged Liam to a televised boxing match during the Brit Awards.\n\nFast-forward to July 2011, and Robbie was clearly not over their long-running feud, suggesting Liam could go 'lick his a***' at one of his concerts at London's Wembley Stadium.\n\nIn recent times, the pair have been known to take jibes at each other on social media and on stage.\n\nRevealing he'd still like to take part in a professional boxing match against Liam, the charts stalwart told GQ: 'I think last time in the noughties Liam wanted to go down to an abandoned railway track or something.\n\n'I don't want to do that. It's got to be f**king whistles and bells if it happens... Liam and I would be a wonderful thing.'\n\nHe fancies his chances against the former Oasis star nowadays, admitting he's in the best physical shape of his life.\n\n'I'm in good nick. I've been boxing and sparring. So let's just say I'd be more than happy to get in the ring with him', he said.\n\n'More than happy. Let\u2019s be having you. And obviously I'd win. Not on points, no. He'd go down in the third round I reckon.\n\n'And we\u2019d have to get a proper licence as we don\u2019t want to be wearing any head protection. Knock out. Third round. Nighty night. Yep.'\n\nSee the full interview available online now via GQ HYPE.", "description": "Robbie Williams has revealed he could not give advice to a struggling Zayn Malik following his departure from One Direction because he was 'f**k** too'.", "authors": ["Harry Howard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/12/20278050-0-image-a-8_1572265397918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
