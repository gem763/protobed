The largest domestic streaming-TV platform Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is expected to release earnings on Nov. 6. As consumers have been moving from traditional pay-TV services to streaming services, ROKU stock has become a clear winner. On Sept. 9, Roku shares hit an all-time high at $175.66. And year-to-date, the stock is up over an eye-popping 342%.\n\nIs Roku Stock a Buy Prior to Quarterly Earnings?

Now, Roku stock is hovering around $130.\n\nI would not bet against Roku shares longer-term as management is successfully increasing the customer base. Yet I\u2019m willing to wait for the release of earnings before buying into the stock. Here is why.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStreaming TV Wars and Roku Stock\n\nIn 2007, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) became the first company to stream video online, marking the start of a series of disruptions in the TV industry. A decade plus on, investors are now beginning to wonder if the streaming video market has become rather crowded. Roku has been a pioneer in streaming video gadgets. The company started as a hardware manufacturer, in its early days building boxes to enable viewers to watch streaming content on their TVs.\n\nTherefore it has had the first mover\u2019s advantage in the streaming device market. At present, Roku and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) control about 70% of the U.S. streaming device market. Roku is ahead of Amazon domestically; however the latter has made considerable headway globally, where Roku is still lagging. Europe seems to be the next phase of international growth for both companies.\n\nIn addition to Amazon\u2019s Fire TV, ROKU is facing increasing competition from tech rivals such as Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromecast and Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple TV. Indeed, the September decline in Roku stock price was exacerbated when Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) said it was going to give away free streaming boxes \u2014 Xfinity Flex \u2014 to internet subscribers.\n\nComcast customers will be able to access streaming services and manage other connected devices through their televisions. Thus Roku may likely be adversely affected as some users may decide to use Comcast\u2019s free streaming box.\n\nMeanwhile, as the streaming wars heat up, could ROKU stock may become a takeover candidate?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow ROKU Stock Makes Money\n\nCurrently, ROKU stock\u2019s revenue is fueled by two segments: Player, which represents sales of its digital media boxes; and, Platform, which includes advertising sales, licensing and other non-hardware revenue sources.\n\nInitially, Roku\u2019s player segment accounted for about 75%, while its platform segment, which generates revenue mainly through advertising and content partnerships, provided the other 25%.\n\nHowever, these ratios have been changing rapidly. The platform segment accounts for the bulk of the company\u2019s sales. Management monetizes the platform by offering subscription-based as well as ad-supported streaming services for viewers.\n\nRoku takes a share of subscriptions and ads from third-party streaming services that are available on its platform. The expanding platform business means that the advertising business is growing. As management changed Roku\u2019s business model, the share price has been rocketing up.\n\nIn other words, once Roku\u2019s hardware makes it to viewers\u2019 homes, then both subscription services and advertising revenue through the platform create the real growth for the stock. The way Roku delivers personalized ads to TV audiences can in some ways be compared to the way Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) delivers ads over social media.\n\nFor example, Roku sells display ads that it shows on its home screen and on its screen saver. The company also offers ads within the videos it streams from particular channels available through the player. Advertising is now the biggest component of Roku\u2019s platform segment.", "description": "Buying a stock during earnings season can be unpredictable and somewhat tricky for the average investor.
