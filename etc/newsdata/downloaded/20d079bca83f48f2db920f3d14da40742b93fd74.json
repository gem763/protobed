Heavy rain across England, Wales and Northern Ireland will push northwards throughout the day.\n\n'We have not got any weather warnings out [for Sunday], but the rain could cause [road] surface spray, so that could lead to some difficult driving conditions.'\n\nMr Wilson said the wet weather will push north throughout the day into southern Scotland.\n\nIt will be followed by drier weather moving up from the South and South West from the mid-afternoon, Mr Wilson said.\n\nSouth-east England is forecast to see the warmest temperatures at 18C, while the north of England will see the coolest temperatures - between 11C and 12C.\n\nMr Wilson said the rain will 'ease' overnight on Sunday and will be followed by fog patches across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nDespite more wet weather on Monday, Mr Wilson said there is an 'improving picture' for Tuesday, with temperatures reaching up to 16C.\n\nHe said while there will be some rain in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, it will be 'drier' for the rest of the UK.", "description": "The Met Office has issued a severe yellow rain warning that will last from midday to midnight tomorrow and stretch from Salcombe in Devon right up to Leeds.
