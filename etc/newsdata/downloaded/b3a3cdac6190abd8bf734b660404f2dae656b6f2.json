Politico founder John Harris laments the loss of seriousness in American politics, driven mainly by click-hungry media and grandstanding politicians. Thanks to a rush to impeachment talk even before establishing initial facts on Ukraine-Gate, Harris argues, what should be \u201cnews of unquestionable gravity\u201d has now just become yet another kind of \u201cfodder for the ideological and cultural wars.\u201d\n\nAsterisks mine, of course:\n\nIt is too early to tell what will come of House Democrats\u2019 decision to launch an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, but not too early to conclude that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has failed to revive the concept of solemnity in American politics. That was the obvious intent Tuesday, when she stood in front of a bank of flags, invoking the Founding Fathers and Constitutional Convention of 1787, as she announced the impeachment inquiry. But the reaction, underway even before she started speaking, made clear that for much of the country, it was just another day in what Rahm Emanuel, when he was Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff, called the metropolis of \u201cF***nutsville.\u201d The news may be important, it may be swerving wildly in surprising ways, but never these days is it something that commands reverent attention.\n\nWell, why might that be? It might be because Democrats, and House Democrats in particular, have been demanding impeachment since even before Donald Trump took office. At a certain point, the cry of \u201cwolf!\u201d loses its \u201cunquestionable gravity\u201d when wielded as a talking point for any hint of unhappiness and as a demand for attention.\n\nAmy Walter writes at the Cook Report that all of this will likely be filtered through the lens of petty partisanship, no matter how Democrats frame it. That\u2019s the problem with constantly politicizing everything, and perhaps with making Trump their central focus rather than wider problems of corruption and dysfunction:\n\nThere are very few constants in life, but one thing we can count on these days is the consistency of Trump\u2019s approval ratings; they are the most stable in modern history. At his lowest point, the president has never dipped below 35 percent, but even on his best days, his approval ratings haven\u2019t broken 46 percent. From fights about inauguration size to stories of a soaring stock market to the outrage over Charlottesville and the release of the Mueller report, Trump\u2019s approval ratings have remained incredibly stable. So, why should we think that an impeachment inquiry \u2014 and possible impeachment \u2014 will upset this balance? \u2026 There are other Democrats, however, who fear that this is making things harder for their party in 2020. I bumped into a Democratic pollster the other day who lamented the decision by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to move forward with an inquiry. Why put the focus on the dysfunction that is Washington, this person said, instead of keeping it solely on Trump? Or as one GOP consultant \u2014 one who has been consistently pessimistic about Trump\u2019s chances in 2020 \u2014 told me: \u201cIf they [Democrats] would just shut the f-up, they\u2019d win everything\u201d in 2020. What people dislike about Trump, said this GOPer, is the tweeting and the chaos. But, voters also hate watching Washington get paralyzed by partisan warfare.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason for such a filter getting applied. As our friend and former colleague Noah Rothman pointed out yesterday at NBC News, we\u2019ve been living in F***nutsville regarding Donald Trump since Election Night 2016. Even if Ukraine-Gate might be the most serious of the allegations surrounding Trump, Democrats\u2019 impeachment obsession had long ago faded into ideological \u201cfodder\u201d:\n\nThese more cautious Democratic lawmakers have endured nearly two years of scorn from their more passionate colleagues over their reluctance to pursue the impeachment of this president. They are owed an apology. Trump\u2019s political allies are now doing whatever they can to frame this inquiry as an illegitimate expression of unhinged partisanship, and they do not lack for supporting evidence. For that, impeachment-crazed Democrats have no one to blame but themselves. \u2026 In 2017, nearly 60 House Democrats voted in favor of impeaching the president for bringing \u201cdisrepute, contempt, ridicule and disgrace on the presidency.\u201d The articles of impeachment ranged from the president\u2019s offensive remarks on the violent clash between white supremacists and counterdemonstrators in Charlottesville to his objection to NFL players kneeling for the national anthem. That same year, Rep. Brad Sherman introduced an absurd impeachment resolution alleging that Trump\u2019s decision to fire his FBI director violated the Constitution. Rep. Al Green has sponsored a series of impeachment articles, among them the claim that Trump calling Rep. Frederica Wilson \u201cwacky\u201d and his foul-mouthed assessment of equatorial nations were gross misuses of presidential authority. A total of 95 Democrats voted to impeach the president for calling illegal migrants and asylum-seekers \u201cinvaders\u201d and saying that four freshman Democrats of color should \u201cgo back\u201d to other countries. And of course, for progressive firebrands and partisan liberal pundits, the Mueller report\u2019s findings that Trump did not conspire with a foreign power and had tried but failed to intervene in the investigation into the events of 2016 constituted the gravest of constitutional crimes. \u2026 But Democrats\u2019 trigger-happy record will be an obstacle to convincing voters who are not already convinced of Trump\u2019s unfitness. What\u2019s more, it will affirm the preconception among some Republicans that these new charges against the president are frivolous and myopic as all the others. The compelling illogic of negative partisanship will do the rest of the work, and Republican lawmakers whose electoral fortunes are tethered to Trump\u2019s will stand with their voters in defense of the president. In the absence of some unambiguous smoking gun, that is unlikely to change, no matter what impeachment proceedings uncover.\n\nHarris\u2019 lament about erosion of confidence in institutions is a serious concern, but unfortunately this isn\u2019t going to make things any better:\n\nThe deeper change is that most Americans no longer respect the institutions of Washington, and many believe at some fundamental level they are not on the level. The Gallup polling organization has been measuring this trend for decades. Back in the 1970s, when my mother and most Americans no matter their partisan affiliation were shocked by Nixon\u2019s lawbreaking, the presidency, Congress and the media all commanded majority or near-majority support when people were asked whether they had high \u201cconfidence\u201d in the institutions. These days, none of these institutions is even close to majority support, and only 11 percent of people say they have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in Congress.\n\nAfter watching their actions for the past week, or for the past two-plus years, can anyone argue that confidence should be higher? Anyone? Mueller? Mueller?\n\nHarris unfortunately and lamentably has this correct. We are roughly the same age, so I have the same experience of watching the Watergate hearings as a child and being impressed by the process \u2014 and of becoming bitterly amused by its accelerated degradation for cheap political payoffs. Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi, and especially the media might be able to force us to live in F***nutsville, but they can\u2019t make us like it, or respect them for it.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s consider the question of just when we made the post-Watergate move to F***nutsville. It wasn\u2019t in 2016; Trump\u2019s election was a reaction to partisanship and the loss of institutional confidence, not the cause of it. It wasn\u2019t in 2013 when Harry Reid dropped the nuclear bomb. We were clearly already there by 2004 when Rathergate happened, too. It also wasn\u2019t in 2002, when Reid and Chuck Schumer decided to make the judiciary a target for total partisan warfare. It wasn\u2019t even in 1998 during the Bill Clinton impeachment, mentioned by Harris specifically, although we had clearly moved into the new digs by that point. It wasn\u2019t even so much in 1987 with Democrats\u2019 revenge on Robert Bork for Watergate, undermining the same institution that worked in Watergate, although perhaps I\u2019d credit that with the official starting point.\n\nThe seeds were sown in 1973\u2019s Roe decision, which took abortion out of reasoned public debate for completely political reasons \u2014 and the reason why Congress has demolished its own credibility in attempts to prevent it from ever getting a second look. Roe has poisoned American politics for nearly 50 years as both sides fight on every front except the legitimate one pre-empted by the pinnacle of judicial activism. The decision might just as well have been titled Welcome to F***nutsville.", "description": "\"If they would just shut the f-up, they'd win everything.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nadler-schiff.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
