On Saturday, park officials found the body of a 3-year-old elephant calf drowned on the waterfall\u2019s first tier.\n\nThey later found five more elephants drowned below the waterfall.\n\nPark officials were using a drone Monday to monitor two elephants who survived the Saturday incident when they discovered the bodies of five more elephants downstream. They believe the elephants belonged to the same herd.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the elephants were trying to help the baby,\u201d park Director Kanchit Srinoppawan told The New York Times. \u201cThey are forest animals that live in a group, and when one member is facing problems or needs help, they will come to help.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the death of all these elephants happened at the same time because they wanted to save the little one.\u201d\n\nRescuers are attempting to use nets to remove the bodies to prevent them from polluting the water.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Park rangers discovered the bodies of five more elephants that apparently died after trying to save a baby elephant that slipped over", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
