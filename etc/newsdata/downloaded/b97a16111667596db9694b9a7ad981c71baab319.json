I will be setting out our plan to shape the economy for the future and triggering the start of our infrastructure revolution.\n\n\u2018This is the right and responsible thing to do \u2013 we must get on with governing.\u2019\n\nBut the Government may not have enough support in Parliament to pass any such Budget, since it does not have a majority. The event is likely to come ahead of a general election, which is widely expected this winter.\n\nWhat time is the Queen's speech today and who writes it?\n\nThe Shadow Chancellor, Labour\u2019s John McDonnell, tweeted: \u2018Tories announced budget in November. More of an electioneering stunt than a budget to rebuild our stalling economy and reset the direction of our country\u2019.\n\nA Queen\u2019s Speech is being held today, ahead of a crunch summit of EU leaders later in the week, when the Government hopes a Brexit deal can be thrashed out.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
