I\u2019ll take it. It\u2019s bragging rights for sure and I don\u2019t take it lightly. But, of course, I could rattle off a long list of great films from this century \u2026 that isn\u2019t hard to do.\n\nIs there a competition in you to care about such things?\n\nI suppose if it was second-best film of the century my first question would have been, \u201cWhat\u2019s No 1?\u201d It\u2019s very possible by the end of this year it could slip off the list entirely.\n\nIs it the same film you would make today? Do you rewatch it?\n\nI haven\u2019t seen it in a number of years, but last I saw it I was very proud and satisfied. It was the first time I\u2019d seen it where I had forgotten exactly what was going to happen next \u2013 and that was a wonderful experience. Having made something, it\u2019s very hard to get back to that sense of discovery. Everything really seems to fit together about it \u2013 the performances, the music, the landscape and the story, all the strands within the larger film, especially the theme of father and son \u2013 all work in unison. It\u2019s also very robust, which I like. I know, as I think we all do, that what makes it really great is Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\nWhich moment or line makes you laugh most?\n\nEverything Daniel does makes me giggle with pleasure and joy. His inventiveness, his devilishness, the joy he has in making such a maniacal portrait of a man unhinged. He has a great chemistry with Paul Dano.\n\nDo you place more faith in capitalism or religion?\n\nWell \u2026 I\u2019m kind of equal opportunity confused and rooting for the best sides of both.\n\nDo you get sick of the milkshake memes?\n\nNah. Too much is never enough.\n\n\n\nDo you think the film feels like a yet more urgent prophecy today? Of bleeding the Earth dry, of allowing greed to triumph over human relations?\n\nUnfortunately, this story doesn\u2019t seem to be going out of style any time soon. It would be nice to see it as science fiction one day. Or an account of how truly insane we all once were.\n\nDonald Trump recently declined to quote any Bible verse he likes. Are there any the film refers to you think may speak to him specifically? Might The Art of the Deal make for an alternative title to There Will Be Blood?\n\nI like all the quotes in the Bible, Old and New Testament, and y\u2019know, it\u2019s very private, I\u2019m not gonna get into it \u2026 [WEARY FACE EMOJI] I can\u2019t quote the Bible from off the top of my head, I have to go rummage around like everyone else. Or, as Plainview says: \u201cI like all religions. I like them all. I don\u2019t belong to one church in particular.\u201d", "description": "The director explains why he won\u2019t quibble with his film being named best of the century \u2013 but what makes it really great is Daniel Day-Lewis", "authors": ["Catherine Shoard"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffd3a2238582df850cdcaf39cf587ad32abc2423/0_1214_5478_3287/master/5478.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fef3b244eee3f5f2c573b7b02ae90698", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
