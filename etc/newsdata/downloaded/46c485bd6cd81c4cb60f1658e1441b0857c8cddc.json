The organization filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on Tuesday naming the city, county, and all 11 members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, accusing the board of blacklisting anyone linked to the NRA, discriminating against the organization on the basis of its \u201cpolitical speech.\u201d The suit notes that courts in Los Angeles and New York have ruled in favor of the organization on similar First Amendment grounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the NRA would rather run to court than do something about the epidemic of gun violence in our country,\u201d John Cot\u00e9, spokesperson for San Francisco\u2019s City Attorney, said in a statement responding to the lawsuit. \u201cThe American people would be better served if the NRA stopped trying to get weapons of war into our communities and instead actually did something about gun safety. Common-sense safety measures like universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and restricting high-capacity magazines would be a good start.\u201d\n\nAt various points in the suit, the NRA\u2019s lawyers accuse the board of using \u201cMcCarthyist elements\u201d to pass a resolution it alternately classifies as \u201ca frivolous insult,\u201d \u201ca nonfrivolous Constitutional threat,\u201d \u201can undisguised political vendetta,\u201d and \u201cthe establishment of an implicit censorship regime.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also lists, 11 times, the address and specific room where the supervisors work. That\u2019s typical practice in a lawsuit like this one, but it stands out somewhat chillingly among all the paranoid language of the lawsuit in this case because the address is inside San Francisco City Hall where, in 1978, San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were shot to death by a disgruntled ex-colleague.\n\nThe NRA is seeking an injunction to stop the resolution from going into effect. Absent an injunction, the lawyers say, \u201cthe NRA, its members and supporters will suffer irrevocable loss and irreparable harm if the members and supporters are unable to obtain government contracts because of their constitutionally-protected rights, or if the NRA is deprived of vendor, contractor, member or donor relationships when persons intimidated by the resolution sever their NRA ties.\u201d\n\nThe NRA, which is going through some financial difficulties at the moment, is also demanding the Supes cover its legal fees in this matter.\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
