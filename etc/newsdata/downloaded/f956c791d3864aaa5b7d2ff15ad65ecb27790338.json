We\u2019re just living peacefully,\u201d said Waqar Haider, an interpreter who works with ethnic minorities.\n\nIn the statement issued by the government, Lam said Hong Kong\u2019s Muslim community called the city home and had always co-existed peacefully with other communities.\n\nChief Imam Muhammad Arshad said Lam\u2019s apology was \u201caccepted\u201d and that the Islamic community hoped to continue living in Hong Kong in peace.\n\nPolice said in a statement the mosque had been accidentally sprayed and that they \u201crespect religious freedom and will strive to protect all places of worship.\u201d\n\nHong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam (C) exits the Kowloon Mosque, or Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre, in Tsim Sha Tsui district in Hong Kong, China October 21, 2019.

The protesters also apologised,\u201d said Mohammed Assan, 32, who worships at the mosque.\n\n\u201cThe police do their work and the protesters have a right to protest. Everybody needs freedom. They demand to live with freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cSUSPECTED BOMBS\u201d FOUND\n\nAfter two weeks of relative calm, Sunday\u2019s large turnout of tens of thousands of protesters reflected strong support for the anti-government movement despite police branding the march illegal.\n\nFamilies and the elderly took to the streets in what began as a peaceful march, many wearing masks or carrying umbrellas to shield their faces in defiance of an anti-mask law that authorities invoked this month to try to quell the unrest.\n\nA more radical faction of mainly young protesters later clashed with riot police.\n\nAcross the Kowloon peninsula protesters torched stores and metro stations. Hundreds of shops were trashed, with mainland China banks and shops with links to the mainland targeted.\n\n\u201cMost alarmingly, there were four instances where suspected bombs were found yesterday,\u201d police said n Monday.\n\nPolice said more than 100 petrol bombs were thrown by protesters, 260 tear gas canisters fired by police and 130 rubber bullets. Hospital authorities said 27 people were injuries, three are in a serious condition.\n\nSince the protests escalated in June, over 2,600 people have been arrested, many under 18 years of age, while two people have been shot and many more injured.\n\nMany people in Hong Kong are angry at what they see as mainland China\u2019s attempts to limit the freedoms the city enjoys under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle enshrined in its handover from Britain in 1997.\n\nThe protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power. Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to split China.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nProtesters are demanding universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, amnesty for those charged over previous demonstrations, and an end to the government\u2019s labelling of the protesters as rioters.\n\nSunday\u2019s unrest followed an annual policy speech last week in which Beijing-backed Lam sought to ease tensions with measures to resolve a chronic housing shortage.\n\nShe also has promised to withdraw a China extradition bill that ignited the unrest and engage in a dialogue with the public, but has so far resisted other protester demands.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam apologised to the city's Muslim community on Monday after police fired a water cannon at a major mosque during operations on Sunday night to quell violent pro-democracy protests in the Asian financial hub.", "authors": ["Sarah Wu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443258183&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0DV", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
