However, the biggest U.K.-focused stocks all made rapid gains, with Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) rising nearly 9%, Royal Bank of Scotland (LON: ) rising 6.5% and housebuilder stocks Barratt and Persimmon (LON: ) rising 6.9% and 9.2% respectively.\n\nEasyJet (LON: ), another company whose business model was at acute risk from a disorderly Brexit, rose 6.1% and even the staid insurance groups Aviva (LON: ) and Legal & General (LON: ) rose 5% and 3.5% respectively.\n\nThe move suggests a greater confidence in a deal being avoided than official comments on Friday might have warranted. EU Council President Donald Tusk, at least, was still hedging his bets\n\nTusk added in a statement that \u201cUnfortunately, we are still in a situation in which the UK has not come forward with a workable, realistic proposal,\u201d and said that a deal at next week\u2019s summit meeting would be impossible if no such proposal was received by the end of the day.\n\nThere was plenty of non-Brexit news going on elsewhere: SAP (DE: ) shares rose 9% after the company announced a strong rise in cloud-based revenues in the third quarter, hours after saying Bill McDermott would step down as CEO after a decade in the job. That comes only a couple of months after activist investor Elliott Management took a stake on the company.\n\nIn France, meanwhile, advertising group Publicis (PA: ) fell 14% after cutting its profit guidance for the year again, while Renault (PA: ) shares rose 3.3% on reports that the board has voted to oust Thierry Bollore as CEO in an effort to get its alliance with Nissan back on track. Nissan too appointed a new CEO earlier this week.", "description": "StockBeat: European Stocks Fly on Trade, Brexit Hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEEAC0LE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
