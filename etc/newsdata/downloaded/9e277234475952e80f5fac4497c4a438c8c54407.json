(AP) \u2014 Only one person remained missing Wednesday after searchers recovered 33 bodies from the charred underwater wreckage of a dive boat that caught fire off the Southern California coast and sank on Labor Day.\n\nAmong the victims were an engineer for Apple who went on the trip with his wife and daughter to celebrate the teen\u2019s 17th birthday, a special effects designer for Disney, a nature photographer, a nurse and a physics teacher from Northern California who was with his 26-year-old daughter.\n\nFive crew members, including the captain, managed to escape the Conception after Monday\u2019s pre-dawn fire that engulfed the boat as the victims slept below decks near the island of Santa Cruz during a three-day scuba diving excursion. The vessel eventually sank and overturned, making the recovery of bodies challenging.\n\nThe only crewmember to die was 26-year-old Allie Kurtz, who quit her corporate job at Paramount Pictures to work on dive boats and had recently been promoted to deckhand on the Conception.\n\nShe was sleeping with the other divers below deck when flames moved quickly through the 75-foot (23-meter) vessel, blocking a narrow stairway and an escape hatch leading to the upper decks.\n\nDNA will be needed to identify the victims. Authorities will use the same rapid analysis tool that identified victims of the deadly wildfire that devastated the Northern California town of Paradise last year, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\nApple engineer Steve Salika and his wife, Diana Adamic, went on the trip with their daughter Tia Salika to celebrate the teen\u2019s 17th birthday, company senior vice president Deirdre O\u2019Brien told The Mercury News newspaper. Apple colleague, Dan Garcia, joined them.\n\nTia was a student at Pacific Collegiate Charter School, a high-performing school serving grades 7 to 12 in Santa Cruz. Also with her was a fellow student Berenice Felipe, according to a letter sent to the school community obtained by NBC News.\n\nO\u2019Brien said in a statement that Salika\u2019s \u201cenergy and enthusiasm touched so many people across our company \u201d during his 30-year career there, and that Garcia \u201cwas as passionate about his job at Apple as he was about his love of diving. Both leave many friends behind and will be deeply missed.\u201d\n\nAnother diver aboard was visual effects designer Charles McIlvain, who was known for his work on films such as \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cGreen Lantern.\u201d\n\nHis wife, Jasmine Lord, said in a family statement that he was with their close friend Marybeth Guiney, who was also the couple\u2019s neighbor in Santa Monica.\n\nBoth lived their lives to the fullest, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cHis laugh was the greatest and his smile could light up the dark,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cHe embraced life with exceptional joy, openness and humor, and all who knew him felt that warmth.\u201d\n\nMcIlvain worked as a visual effects designer for Walt Disney Imagineering and a pipeline engineer and technical animation supervisor at Sony Pictures Imageworks. He also worked for Netflix.\n\nAnother passenger was Lisa Fiedler, a 52-year-old hairdresser and photographer from the community of Mill Valley north of San Francisco, her mother, Nancy Fiedler, told San Francisco\u2019s ABC affiliate, KGO television.\n\n\u201cEverybody loved her,\u201d her mother said.\n\nEducation platform Brilliant, based in San Francisco, confirmed two employees were on the boat over the holiday weekend. Carrie McLaughlin was a senior software engineer, and Kristian Takvam was vice president of engineering, the company said.\n\n\u201cThe loss of Carrie and Kristian is deeply heartbreaking for all of us at Brilliant,\u201d chief executive Sue Khim said. \u201cCarrie and Kristian were incredible friends and colleagues who brought immense passion, talent, leadership, and warmth, and they will be missed dearly. Our hearts are with their families and friends.\u201d\n\nSusana Rosas of Stockton, California, posted that her three daughters \u2014 Evan, Nicole and Angela Quitasol \u2014 were with their father, Michael Quitasol, and stepmother, Fernisa Sison. Evan Quitasol was a nurse in Stockton, where her father and Sison had worked, and her sister Angela was a Stockton science middle school teacher while Nicole worked at a restaurant in Coronado, near San Diego.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s devastated,\u201d said Dominic Selga, Sison\u2019s ex-husband.\n\nThe fire started shortly after 3 a.m. Monday as the boat sat anchored in Platt\u2019s Harbor off Santa Cruz Island, among the rugged, wind-swept isles that form Channel Islands National Park.\n\nScott Chan, a physics teacher at American High School in Fremont, was there too with his 26-year-old daughter Kendra, said Brian Killgore, a spokesman for the Fremont Unified School District.\n\n\u201cHis students knew him to be an innovative and inspiring teacher who developed a passion for physics among his students,\u201d the district said in a statement.\n\nOther divers who died were an Arizona couple, Patricia Beitzinger and Neal Baltz, according to ABC affiliate KNXV-TV in Phoenix. \u201cThey went to heaven doing something they loved together,\u201d Neal\u2019s father, John Baltz, told the television station.\n\nKristy Finstad, a marine biologist and co-owner of Worldwide Diving Adventures in Santa Cruz, was leading the scuba tour and had done hundreds of dives in the Channel Islands, according to her company\u2019s website.\n\n___\n\nWatson reported from San Diego.
