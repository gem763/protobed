But the last is harder to account for. We attempted to track down and piece together the mystery of the seemingly missing moon lander.\n\nNearly every expert we talked to wasn\u2019t certain where it had gone, but w e finally got a convincing answer from a space artist and historian.\n\nHe thinks the lander was scrapped and its aerospace-grade metal possibly reused in jet fighters.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nFollowing is the transcript of the video.\n\nNarrator: NASA has released photos, videos, and audio recordings of its Apollo missions.\n\nAudio clip: We copy you down, Eagle.\n\nNarrator: So there\u2019s little left about these missions that we don\u2019t already know, except for one mystery that\u2019s been hiding in plain sight for decades. One of NASA Apollo lunar modules may be missing. That\u2019s right, missing. And not even NASA seems to know where it is.\n\nAudio clip: Engine\u2019s on five, four, three, two, all engine\u2019s running. We have a liftoff.\n\nMosher: Where is Lunar Module 14? What state was it in? Does anybody have it? Does anybody know where it\u2019s at?\n\nNarrator: From 1962 to 1970, NASA commissioned Grumman Aircraft to build 15 space-worthy lunar modules for its Apollo program. Each one was was labelled Lunar Modules 1 through 15 and cost around $US150 million to make, or about $US1.1 billion today.\n\nAudio clip: Charlie Brown was selected by the astronauts as the codename for the Apollo 10 command module and his friend Snoopy was the call sign for the lunar module.\n\nMosher: NASA launched 10 of these lunar landers into space. Six of them landed on the surface of the moon and brought the astronauts back. Other four were used for practices and dry runs, future missions. And there were five that were left on the ground.\n\nNarrator: Three of those five that never went to space, Lunar Modules-2, 9, and 13, are in museums, which leaves us with LM-14 and 15.\n\nMosher: Lunar Module 15 was another lunar lander that was being build for Apollo 20, which of course never happened. They turned it into scrap metal. So that leaves us with one lunar lander, LM-14. On the Smithsonian\u2019s website, there\u2019s a page listing the lunar landers and all of their fates. Lunar Module 15 is listed as scrapped but if you go up one row and you look at Lunar Module 14, it says not used. What that means, we don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s what started this adventure in the first place.\n\nNarrator: To be clear, it is not easy to hide one of these landers. Once complete, they\u2019re the size of a small house and weigh about 35,000 pounds.\n\nMosher: Now when we started into Lunar Module 14, things are a little weird. The documents that we have access to said incomplete or not used. It didn\u2019t say anything about it being scrapped. It didn\u2019t say it was in any institution or museum. And so we started digging into this.\n\nNarrator: NASA and the Smithsonian didn\u2019t have evidence to its whereabouts, the Cradle of Aviation Museum didn\u2019t know, and even historians at Northrop Grumman, the original manufacturers of the lunar modules, were stumped.\n\nMosher: But one of the experts that we talked to said, \u201chey, I think it\u2019s at the Franklin Institute \u201cin Philadelphia\u201d. We looked into that and it was not it. It was an early prototype from the Apollo program, a lunar module that was never supposed to fly into space.\n\nNarrator: And then we got a lead, sort of.\n\nMosher: There was a document from March, 1978 that is a disposition, or a list, of everything in the Apollo program. What it was, what its code number was, and where it\u2019s located. And that document is missing page number nine, which is the page that describes where Lunar Module 14 would be located or what happened to it, if anything.\n\nNarrator: Yeah, it sounds exactly like some sort of Hollywood spy thriller, but this actually happened. Nobody could find this document. Even one of NASA\u2019s historians looked for us and couldn\u2019t locate it. And the same went for the National Archives. We finally got some clue as to what happened to it from University of Houston\u2019s Space Archive.\n\nMosher: Hi, this is Dave Mosher with Business Insider. Is this Jean?\n\nJean: Hi, yes it is. Hi, Dave.\n\nMosher: Hi. So I heard you found page nine of that document. Can you read it to me, tell me what is says?\n\nJean: Next to LM-14, it says mission cancelled.\n\nMosher: Mission cancelled. And then is there anything else that it says?\n\nJean: The next column says remarks. It says deleted from program.\n\nMosher: Deleted from program. It doesn\u2019t say where it went or what happened to it?\n\nJean: No, it does not.\n\nMosher: OK.\n\nNarrator: So we were at a dead end. And to be fair, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time a moon lander has been lost to history. In 1969, the lunar lander for Apollo 10 was ejected into space as part of a dry run for Apollo 11.\n\nAudio clip: Ground contact was maintained with the ascent stage until its batteries were depleted, some 12 hours later.\n\nNarrator: NASA didn\u2019t track the lander at the time, so it was missing, floating somewhere in space for decades. Until, in 2019, a group of enthusiasts from the UK said they were pretty sure where it was floating in space. So if those guys could find a lost lunar module in the vast expanse of space, why does nobody know where a moon lander on Earth has gone?\n\nAudio clip: OK, this has got to be the greatest site ever.\n\nNarrator: So we had pretty much given up on uncovering the truth. That was until we got ahold of Paul Fjeld a few weeks later. He\u2019s obsessed with these lunar landers.\n\nMosher: In fact, he worked with Cradle of Aviation Museum to retrofit LM-13 into an Apollo-style landing site within the museum.\n\nNarrator: So here\u2019s what he had to say about our grand missing lunar lander mystery.\n\nFjeld: 14 actually never really got built. I\u2019m not gonna bet my son\u2019s life, but I\u2019ll bet a lot of money that there\u2019s not a scrap of LM-14 left.\n\nNarrator: Of course, that would explain why there\u2019s no photos of it.\n\nMosher: The really revealing thing that Paul showed us was this progress chart from Grumman Of the lunar landers that were under construction right before NASA cancelled the entire program and it shows that LM-14 was about 1-5% complete based of Fjeld\u2019s analysis. So the farthest that technicians at Grumman got was basically cutting out all of these pieces of metal and starting to assemble them, weld them together, before NASA cancelled the program. We also spoke to two other space flight history experts and they also think that LM-14 was scrapped, but they\u2019re not entirely certain of that.\n\nFjeld: I\u2019m gonna say they would have said, \u201clook, we got a bunch of F-14s \u201cthat are just starting to come off the line here. \u201cThis is what\u2019s the future for Grumman. \u201cWe need all the metal that we can get. \u201cThis is some lovely 2024 aluminium, \u201c7075 structural aluminium. \u201cCan we use that on F-14s?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nNarrator: So LM-14\u2019s frankensteined pieces maybe did fly, in a way. And perhaps they\u2019re in an aviation museum right now, as part of a jet.\n\nAudio clip: In this strange, metallic bird rides the ancient and endless dream of all mankind.\n\nNarrator: But we may never know for sure.\n\nFjeld: I can\u2019t guarantee that some guy didn\u2019t just drive it off the lot and it\u2019s now sitting in his basement or up in an attic that his grandkids have no idea what the hell it is.
