(Submitted by Kevin Finlayson)\n\nThe public was reintroduced to the Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra (MWSO) in 2012 through It Wasn't Teatime, a radio documentary by the CBC's David Gutnick.\n\nThat documentary drew on research by a graduate student named Maria Noriega Rachwal, who later wrote a book about the orchestra called From Kitchen To Carnegie Hall.\n\nBlake's co-producer, Joanne Robertson, came upon the book last year and knew this was a topic worth pursuing.\n\nDavid Gutnick's documentary on Ethel Stark and the Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra 26:07\n\nEthel Stark put the orchestra together in 1940, the same year Quebec women got the vote. The women played their first concert at the chalet atop Mount Royal six months after their first rehearsal.\n\nIn addition to defying the sexist notion that only men could play in orchestras, the MWSO crossed linguistic, racial and class divides.\n\nIt featured women of colour, both anglophones and francophones, from Jewish, Protestant and Catholic backgrounds.\n\nStark, a Jew, made sure of that.\n\n\"There are speeches that Ethel Stark wrote where she says, 'I want this orchestra to be for women of all backgrounds and creeds,'\" Blake said. \"I think she had that in mind because she ran into prejudice throughout her musical career.\"\n\nEthel Stark, the founder of the Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra, conducting the CBC Symphony Orchestra.

People just kind of walk through on their way to work.\"\n\nGiven that commuters and others will walk past at any time within the looping projection, Blake subdivided the five-and-a-half-minute project into sections that are meant to work well enough on their own.\n\n\"There's a pretty good chance that you're going to arrive maybe in the middle of the piece, not necessarily at the beginning,\" she said.\n\nShe also had to be careful about the audio she used, since orchestral music can be quite dramatic.\n\n\"I don't want to give anyone a heart attack on their way to work.\"\n\nThe five-and-a-half minute project features audio of some of the orchestra members and archival audio from the orchestra's performances. (John MacFarlane/CBC)\n\nThe MWSO played its last note in 1965, having made great strides, including becoming the first Canadian symphony orchestra to perform at Carnegie Hall in New York. Ultimately, the women had grown tired of never being paid professional wages.\n\nTimes had also changed by then, and other orchestras were finally allowing female musicians into their ranks.\n\nThe MWSO were trailblazers in the struggle for gender equality, and Montreal's premiere performance space for classical music seems a fitting locale for the video installation.\n\n\"When this story came my way, I thought: 'Oh, this could be the perfect venue for that subject,'\" Blake said. \"Hopefully it sparks your interest to stay to the end and maybe stick around and wait for it to play again from the beginning.\"\n\nThe Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra rehearses on Jan. 9, 1942.
