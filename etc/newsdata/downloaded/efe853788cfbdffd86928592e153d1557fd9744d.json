Twitter 7/8 Yoga The plank became an internet sensation Twitter 8/8 Making history Trudeau's gender-balanced cabinet was the first of its kind AP\n\nMr Trudeau, 47, eldest son of the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau, and who was first elected premier in 2015, has been on the back foot since the first images emerged this week. They showed him with his face in dark make-up at a party at a school where he was teaching in 2001, aged 29.\n\nThe school yearbook picture, obtained by Time magazine, show him wearing a turban for an Arabian Nights-themed fancy dress party at the West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver.\n\nThe prime minister, who launched his re-election campaign just a week ago, said he should have known better. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off at myself, I\u2019m disappointed in myself,\u201d Mr Trudeau told reporters.\n\nBut on Thursday, the problem appeared to get worse for Mr Trudeau, as other images of him in blackface emerged. Asked how many incidents there may have been, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out I had not remembered.\u201d\n\nHe said he had already shared \u201cthe moments I recollected\u201d, adding: \u201cBut I recognise that it is something absolutely unacceptable to do. And I appreciate calling it makeup, but it was blackface, and that is just not right.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Earlier this year, Virginia governor Ralph Northam faced repeated calls to stand down after a racist picture surfaced from his 1984 medical school yearbook. He did not do so.\n\nThe episode is deeply embarrassing for Mr Trudeau and disappointing for his supporters. Despite his privileged background, he has long pitched himself as champion of the marginalised, and has promoted a number of women and ethnic minorities to his cabinet.\n\nTo his admirers in the US, he has been the opposite of Donald Trump.\n\nPolls show Mr Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party being pressed hard ahead of election day on 21 October. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has said Mr Trudeau was \u201cnot fit to govern this country\u201d.\n\nAsked on Thursday if he intended to stand aside as leader of the party, Mr Trudeau said he had spent much of the day speaking to colleagues and community leaders.\n\n\u201cI will continue to do the work that is necessary to keep us moving forward in the right way,\u201d he said. \u201cCanadians have an important choice to make on October 21 and I trust Canadians to make that right choice.\u201d\n\nGreg Fergus, a Liberal member of parliament who is black, said there was a lot of confusion and hurt in the black community but noted that the prime minister had apologised.\n\nHe pointed out that it was Mr Trudeau who put Viola Desmond, a black woman who refused to leave the whites-only section of a Canadian movie theatre in 1944, on Canada\u2019s $10 bill.\n\nMr Fergus added: \u201cI think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for diversity.\u201d\n\nMitzie Hunter, a Liberal who is running to lead the party in Ontario provincial politics and is black, tweeted: \u201cI know it is not representative of the man he is. This is a teachable moment for all of us. I accept his apology and I hope Canadians do too.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Canadian prime minister Justin\u00a0Trudeau has declined to say how many times he may have worn blackface, as the mounting scandal threatened his re-election campaign.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/15/trudeau-blackface.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
