(Fred Ernst/Associated Press)\n\nThe woman, a graduate of McGill University's education program, said she didn't hear back from either the Lester B. Pearson School Boards or the Commission scolaire de Montr\u00e9al.\n\n\"Now, I am depressed and anxious, and I feel like a second-class citizen in my own province,\" she said in the document.\n\nAnother woman, who wears a hijab and has worked for years as a preschool and primary school teacher, said she tried to secure a position with the Commission Scolaire Marie-Victorin, in Montreal's South Shore, at the end of last year in order to qualify for the grandfather clause.\n\nAt the beginning of September, she was told she no longer had a job if she didn't remove her hijab. Now, she works as a school monitor at another school, with a lower salary.\n\n\"I had to find a job, but I cannot take off my hijab,\" she said in her affidavit.\n\nThere are four criteria for a judge to grant an injunction: a law must raise serious constitutional questions, cause irreparable harm, its suspension must not be overly inconvenient and the matter must be urgent.\n\nIn his July decision, Yergeau found the plaintiffs had only satisfied the first condition.\n\nThe civil rights groups contend in last week's court filing that the judge erred in saying the other criteria weren't satisfied.\n\nThey argue, furthermore, that there is no longer any question that the impact of the law is \"hypothetical.\"", "description": "Civil rights groups fighting Quebec's religious symbols law have filed new evidence which, they say, demonstrates\u00a0without a doubt it has \"caused and continues to cause irreparable harm.\"", "authors": ["Benjamin Shingler Covers Politics", "Immigration", "Social Issues For Cbc Montreal.
