In progressive spaces and within the LGBTQ community, pronoun introductions are common and largely seen as an inclusive step towards a more nuanced understanding of gender. But the practice has also been mocked and criticized, and has quickly become part of America\u2019s culture wars.\n\nThe National Center for Lesbian Rights was quick to call out Cuomo\u2019s joke:\n\nNational Center for Lesbian Rights (@NCLRights) Dear @ChrisCuomo, people\u2019s pronouns are not a punchline. In a year where LGBTQ Americans are finally being recognized on the national Presidential stage, making jokes about gender pronouns is beneath your dignity. Please do better in the future. #EqualityTownHall\n\nAs was Charlotte Clymer of the Human Rights Campaign:\n\nCharlotte Clymer\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@cmclymer) Tell that to a trans or non-binary person who gets the shit beat out of them for referring to themselves with the correct pronouns in front of some fucking clown who can't accept it.\n\n\n\nY'all need to realize things like this have real world consequences for some of us. https://t.co/NwiKwcJrl0\n\nCuomo issued an apology following the event, saying he was \u201can ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality\u201d.\n\nChristopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall.\n\nAngelica Ross, a trans rights advocate and trans actor who stars in Pose, said Cuomo\u2019s apology was not enough, and showed he did not understand the importance of pronouns.\n\nAngelica Ross (@angelicaross) What you should do @ChrisCuomo is not just apologize but admit what\u2019s behind this is YOUR ignorance. You just showed you don\u2019t understand the importance of pronouns, so how do you confidently crown yourself an ally? Learn from black & brown trans women @CNN #EqualityTownHall https://t.co/kVXm2s7u8t\n\nThe town hall featured the biggest names in the Democratic 2020 presidential race to become the nominee to take on Donald Trump at the next election, and comes in the same week as the supreme court heard three discrimination cases involving LGBTQ individuals \u2013 the first supreme court case involving the civil rights of transgender people.\n\nElizabeth Warren's deadpan quip in LGBT debate wins plaudits Read more\n\nAmong the standout moments of the evening was an emotional interruption from Blossom C Brown, a black trans woman who was not scheduled to ask a question, but took the mic and expressed her anger at the erasure of black trans people from the evening.\n\n\u201cBlack trans women are dying,\u201d she said. \u201cOur lives matter. I am an extraordinary black trans woman, and I deserve to be here.\u201d\n\nBlossom interrupted 2020 candidate and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has been asked about what he would do to tackle violence against black trans women. O\u2019Rourke responded, \u201cI\u2019m going to listen to trans women of color. They will be the guide.\u201d\n\nAt least 19 trans people have been killed this year, according to the Human Rights Campaign, four of whom were killed in Texas. Last year, there were at least 26 deaths, with most of those people being black trans women.\n\nMary Emily O'Hara (@MaryEmilyOHara) Blossom C. Brown, a black trans woman, interrupts Beto to say \"not one black trans woman has taken the mic tonight, no black trans man has taken the mic...that's how anti-blackness works. That's how erasure works.\" #EqualityTownHall\n\nCharlotte Clymer\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@cmclymer) And by the way, Blossom Brown had a great point: have we heard enough from Black trans and non-binary people tonight? The community impacted most by violence and discrimination? I think not. She's right.#EqualityTownHall\n\nPete Buttigieg, the South Bend mayor and 2020 Democratic candidate, the first openly LGBTQ person to run for president, was asked about the ban on gay men donating blood. He responded:\n\n\u201cMy blood is not welcome in this country. It\u2019s not based on science, it\u2019s based on prejudice.\u201d\n\nHe said he would direct the FDA to make rules that conform with science.\n\nButtigieg also talked about how people living with HIV can be undetectable, which means untransmittable, giving a rare national platform to the slogan \u201cU equals U\u201d.\n\nThe CNN host Anderson Cooper also asked Buttigieg, who has frequently spoken about his faith on the campaign trail: \u201cDo you believe God made you gay?\u201d\n\nHe responded: \u201cThe decision was made way above my pay grade.\u201d", "description": "After Kamala Harris introduced herself with \u2018My pronouns are she, her and hers,\u2019 Cuomo responded \u2018Mine too\u2019 at an LGBTQ town hall", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bacedf63b634ca4543b4973084f0a615da7b66f1/0_169_5117_3072/master/5117.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c38ec93140253045700f265da6f85eeb", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
