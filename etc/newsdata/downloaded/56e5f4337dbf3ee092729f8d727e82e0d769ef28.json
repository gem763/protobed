The five-part \u201cstory time\u201d account was certainly unflattering: Regalbuto made it clear to her viewers that she felt duped and used by Riff Raff.\n\nBut the comments that streamed in revealed that many of those watching had zeroed in on a more disturbing aspect of the relationship: Regalbuto was just 17 and still in high school when she says that she first hooked up with the hip-hop star, who was almost twice her age.\n\nIt was not the first time the 37-year-old EDM, trap and hip-hop star had been accused of pursuing girls under the age of 18. At least one other woman has accused Riff Raff of making unwanted advances on her as a teenager, and two others have accused him of rape. But Regalbuto\u2019s videos brought the issue to the surface once again.\n\n\u201cI mainly posted my one video just to get things off my chest\u2026 but it blew up overnight,\u201d Regalbuto told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear other girls saying the same story, it\u2019s sad but it\u2019s also relieving, because it\u2019s good to feel that you\u2019re not alone in a situation like this,\u201d she added.\n\nIn a statement, Riff Raff\u2019s lawyer said he \u201ccategorically denies these baseless allegations of a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old.\u201d The artist, whose real name is Horst Simco, has previously denied all other allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nRegalbuto says she barely knew who Riff Raff was the day he approached her at the Warped Tour in 2015. In fact, she says, she was trying to sneak a peek of her favorite band, Sleeping with Sirens, when she noticed the rapper sizing her up. He eventually sent her his number through Twitter, and the two wound up spending the rest of the day on his bus.", "description": "Photo Illustration by the Daily Beast / Photos Getty / Courtesy Alyssa RegalbutoOnce a celebrated Vine star\u2014\u201ca kind of human meme,\u201d as Rolling Stone once put it\u2014Houston rapper Riff Raff was trending on a different video app this week.\u00a0In jumpy, 60-second videos on TikTok, college student Alyssa Regalbuto", "authors": ["Emily.Shugerman Thedailybeast.Com", "Emily Shugerman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9OlkDXhtqwsrhHY7E.EkVA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/0eb58b7e2660eab18f9d072110c5e599", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
