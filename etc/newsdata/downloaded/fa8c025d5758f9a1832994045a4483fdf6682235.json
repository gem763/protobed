Below is a lightly edited excerpt of the conversation.\n\nNilay Patel: I thought the most interesting part of the entire thing is when you were alone with him during his \u201cThink Week\u201d and he\u2019s alone in the house and he\u2019s reading books, and over time you see the Diet Coke cans pile up. I\u2019ve never seen the richest man in the world open a can of Diet Coke. Most people don\u2019t have that experience. It\u2019s just very human and he\u2019s literally alone. What was it like to go into that space with him?\n\nDavis Guggenheim: Well, so interesting... I\u2019ll pull the curtain a little bit when I\u2019m making documentaries.\n\nYou say, okay, well here we are. We\u2019re doing a time lapse of you working, right? And we\u2019re going to start you reading at the late afternoon and then we\u2019re going to have you reading and working till night so that we get a sense of time passing. I\u2019ve done this in different projects. It\u2019s often usually like the person says \u201cWhat you want me to read?\u201d or like \u201cWhat page does it need to be on?\u201d And for Bill it was just like \u201cOh, I get to read.\u201d\n\nI know the book, it\u2019s Tara Westover\u2019s book Educated, which he just picked up that day. It was on his list and he read for like an hour and 45 minutes. And we\u2019re all moving around, moving lights, we\u2019re moving camera positions, we\u2019re all whispering, but I\u2019m telling you... that guy just read as if we weren\u2019t there, and drinking Diet Cokes at will.\n\nSo it\u2019s kind of astounding his focus. Us having cameras and lights was really uninteresting to him. It was more like \u201cOh, I get a quiet moment to read? I\u2019ll take my quiet moment to read.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s many shots of him using a computer. Was it like \u201cBill, just use Excel for a while and we\u2019re going to take some beautiful b-roll of you\u201d? How would you set that up with Bill Gates?\n\nIn this case you just say, \u201cHey Bill, we want to film you at your desk working\u201d and then he just does whatever he wants to do.\n\nThe one thing I did tell him to do \u2014 this is the end of the day and I knew he played online bridge \u2014 and so I was like, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you play online bridge now?\u201d\n\nHe went and played online bridge for 45 minutes. But again, once I said to do it, he could care less that we were there. He was trying to win the bridge game.\n\nWhat\u2019s the thing that surprised you most about Gates?\n\nHe\u2019s very emotional.\n\nThat actually is hugely surprising.\n\nThe first three or four interviews, I did not always see emotion. Melinda [Gates] talks about it. When they\u2019re all watching a movie, the kids notice that he\u2019s the first to cry. He cries a lot and I think he presents... because his intellect is so powerful and he believes so much in sort of rational thinking and optimization of things, that he always leads with that.\n\nThis is me speaking for what I think he thinks, which is I think he truly believes that emotions shouldn\u2019t cloud your decisions. And too often businesses and nonprofits and foundations, their decision-making is clouded by emotion. Certainly, it happens to me all the time. He wants to be analytical. He doesn\u2019t share that side of him. And that\u2019s a shame. And I think the series starts to reveal that about him. I think you see someone who is very driven by wanting to do good in the world. Driven by a sense of deep, deep unfairness that children on the other side of the world are dying for things that his children have.\n\nThere\u2019s a scene where he\u2019s going through the stats of how many kids have polio and how many people he can save. And you say something like \u201cWell, that\u2019s not very inspiring.\u201d He\u2019s like \u201cYeah, so what?\u201d And it occurs to me that he\u2019s the person who needs to be inspired, like he\u2019s got the money and the power. He\u2019s got to get affected. And it sounds like you\u2019re saying he is actually deeply affected.\n\nHe is deeply affected or else why wouldn\u2019t he just be like buying art or, you know, huge toys like other billionaires do? I mean, I actually don\u2019t know why he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m only guessing why he doesn\u2019t display his emotion more. You know, people think of him as sort of like an analytical guy who doesn\u2019t have emotions. I think he\u2019s deeply emotional. He just doesn\u2019t show it.\n\nInside Bill\u2019s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates is now available on Netflix.", "description": "The Verge chats with filmmaker Davis Guggenheim on his new documentary, Inside Bill\u2019s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates on Netflix.", "authors": ["Andrew Marino", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iEyKLmPly2bfwjkkakS1yt7SLQM=/0x324:4500x2680/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19211240/Gates_Unit_00220_RC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
