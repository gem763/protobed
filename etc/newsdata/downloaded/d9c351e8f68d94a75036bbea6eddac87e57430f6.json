Although he frequently bemoaned the decline of literary standards, he was as well placed as a contemporary critic could hope to be. He appeared on best-seller lists with such works as \u201cThe Western Canon\u201d and \u201cThe Book of J,\u201d was a guest on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and other programs and was a National Book Award finalist and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. A readers\u2019 poll commissioned by the Modern Library ranked \u201cThe Western Canon\u201d at No. 58 on a list of the 20th century\u2019s best nonfiction English-language books.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis greatest legacy could well outlive his own name: the title of his breakthrough book, \u201cThe Anxiety of Influence.\u201d Dr. Bloom argued that creativity was not a grateful bow to the past, but a Freudian wrestle in which artists denied and distorted their literary ancestors while producing work that revealed an unmistakable debt.\n\nHe was referring to poetry in his 1973 book, but \u201canxiety of influence\u201d has come to mean how artists of any kind respond to their inspirations. His theory has been endlessly debated, parodied and challenged, including by Dr. Bloom.\n\nThe book\u2019s title has entered the culture in ways Dr. Bloom likely never imagined or desired, such as a New York Times headline that read \u201cJay-Z Confronts the Anxiety of Being Influential\u201d or a Canadian rock band called \u201cAnxiety of Influence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDr. Bloom openly acknowledged his own heroes, among them Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson and the 19th-century critic Walter Pater. He honored no boundaries between the life of the mind and life itself and absorbed the printed word to the point of fashioning himself after a favorite literary character, Shakespeare\u2019s betrayed but life-affirming Falstaff.\n\nDr. Bloom\u2019s affinity began at age 12, when Falstaff rescued him from \u201cdebilitating self-consciousness,\u201d and he more than lived up to his hero\u2019s oversize aura in person. For decades he ranged about the Yale campus, with untamed hair and an anguished, theatrical voice, given to soliloquies over the plight of modern times.\n\nNews of his death received a mixed response from former Yale students. Some praised his extraordinary erudition and ability to recite verse from memory, while others noted allegations of sexual harassment. In 2004, the author Naomi Wolf wrote that Dr. Bloom made unwanted advances while she was attending Yale. He denied the allegations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHarold Bloom, the youngest of five children, was born July 11, 1930, in New York\u2019s East Bronx. His parents were Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Russia, neither of whom ever learned to read English.\n\nDr. Bloom\u2019s literary journey began with Yiddish poetry, but he soon discovered the works of Hart Crane, T.S. Eliot, William Blake and other poets. He would allege that as a young man he could absorb 1,000 pages at a time.\n\n\u201cThe sense of freedom they conferred,\u201d he wrote of his favorite books, \u201cliberated me into a primal exuberance.\u201d\n\nHe graduated in 1951 from Cornell University, where he studied under the celebrated critic M.H. Abrams, then was a Fulbright Scholar at Pembroke College at the University of Cambridge. After earning his doctorate from Yale in 1955, he joined the university\u2019s English faculty. He married Jeanne Gould in 1958 and had two sons.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the 1950s, Dr. Bloom opposed the rigid classicism of Eliot, but in the following decades, he condemned Afrocentrism, feminism, Marxism and other movements he placed in the \u201cSchool of Resentment.\u201d A proud elitist, he disliked the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books and slam poetry and was angered by Stephen King\u2019s receiving an honorary National Book Award. He dismissed as \u201cpure political correctness\u201d the awarding of the Nobel Prize for literature to Doris Lessing, author of the feminist classic \u201cThe Golden Notebook.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am your true Marxist critic,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cfollowing Groucho rather than Karl, and take as my motto Groucho\u2019s grand admonition, \u2018Whatever it is, I\u2019m against it.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Western Canon,\u201d published in 1994, Dr. Bloom named the 26 crucial writers in Western literature, from Dante to Samuel Beckett, and declared Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo among the contemporary greats. Shakespeare reigned at the canon\u2019s center, the inventor of our modern, self-conscious selves, a patriarch so mighty that Freud, Tolstoy and other latter-day masters nearly drove themselves mad rejecting him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFreud is essentially prosified Shakespeare,\u201d Dr. Bloom observed.\n\nDr. Bloom faced harsh criticism from detractors he called \u201clemmings.\u201d Observers noted that \u201cThe Western Canon\u201d featured a good number of Yale-affiliated poets on its list of important living American authors. Dr. Bloom was mocked as out of touch and accused of recycling a small number of themes. \u201cBloom had an idea; now the idea has him,\u201d British critic Christopher Ricks once observed.\n\nDr. Bloom did not restrict his praise to white men. In \u201cThe Book of J\u201d (1990), he stated that some parts of the Bible were written by a woman. (He often praised the God of the Old Testament as one of the greatest fictional characters.) He also admired Virginia Woolf, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Emily Dickinson; among the hundreds of critical editions of books he edited were works on Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and Amy Tan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDr. Bloom wrote one novel, \u201cThe Flight to Lucifer,\u201d but was no more effective than most critics attempting fiction, and he later disowned the book. In \u201cThe Anatomy of Influence,\u201d a summation released in 2011, Dr. Bloom called himself an Epicurean who acknowledged no higher power other than art and who lived for \u201cmoments raised in quality by aesthetic appreciation.\u201d\n\nHis resistance to popular culture was emphatic, but not absolute. He was fond of the rock group The Band and fascinated by the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart and other televangelists. He even confessed to watching MTV, telling the Paris Review in 1990 that \u201cwhat is going on there, not just in the lyrics but in its whole ambience, is the real vision of what the country needs and desires. It\u2019s the image of reality that it sees, and it\u2019s quite weird and wonderful.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "A champion of the Western canon, he faced criticism for dismissing women and Third World writers.", "authors": ["Hillel Italie"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=128", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
