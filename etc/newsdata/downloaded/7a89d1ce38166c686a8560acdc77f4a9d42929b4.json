There's a pool with a grass island in the middle of it, a door from the Playboy Mansion, a table based on the streets of Baghdad, and MJ-branded golf flags.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at the house, and why it's struggling to find a buyer. Most images are from footage provided by Concierge Auctions.\n\nTony Manfred contributed to this post.", "description": "The house was originally listed for $29 million and has every bell and whistle you can think of.
