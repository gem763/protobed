Vieira is said to have played a key part in Lauer's sexual misconduct allegations surfacing\n\nIt was her allegation that led to him being fired.\n\nVieira had a role in encouraging Nevils to report the alleged abuse.\n\nShe urged Nevils to report the incident to NBC executives following the Harvey Weinstein saga.\n\nLauer has angrily denied her allegation that he anally raped her, saying that the pair had consensual anal sex and that it led to an affair.\n\nIn Farrow's new book, Nevils said she met Vieira for drinks one night during the Olympics and that Lauer joined them.\n\nNevils said she had six shots of vodka and wound up going to Lauer's room.\n\nShe said that Lauer pushed her onto a bed and asked if she liked anal sex.\n\nNevils said she declined several times, but then Lauer 'just did it'.\n\nShe described the encounter as 'excruciatingly painful'.\n\n'It was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,' Nevils told Farrow. 'It was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn't want to have anal sex.'\n\nIn his letter, Lauer admitted to his extramarital affair with Nevils. He said on that night in Sochi that they consensually performed a variety of sexual acts.\n\n'She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner,' he wrote. 'At no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent. She seemed to know exactly what she wanted to do.'\n\nLauer and Vieira, who worked together from 2006 until 2011, had a close relationship during their time on the show but that changed when the allegations came to light\n\nHe claimed they had an affair that lasted after they returned to the United States. Nevils described the sex as 'transactional' and that she feared the effect Lauer could have on her career.\n\nIn one case, she told Farrow that she had asked Lauer for help recording a goodbye video for a friend leaving NBC. He allegedly told her he'd do it in his office, and then demanded oral sex.\n\nNevils said she felt she had to do something to protect other women at NBC News, leading to her filing the complaint against Lauer in November 2017.\n\n'Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time,' NBC News said in a statement last week. 'That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.'\n\nNBC said then that Lauer had been fired for 'inappropriate sexual conduct'.\n\nThe specific rape allegation did not become public until details emerged from Farrow's new book.\n\nNevils grew disenchanted with NBC, feeling bosses there weren't doing enough to protect her anonymity internally and mischaracterizing the relationship with Lauer as an affair.\n\nAfter some rough times, including being hospitalized for post-traumatic stress and alcohol abuse, she left NBC with a seven-figure settlement.\n\nNBC Chairman Andrew Lack, in a memo sent to network staff last week, said the network hadn't known of Lauer's behavior with Nevils until the day before he was fired.\n\nNevils agreed to be named and spoke on the record to share more details of the alleged rape in Ronan Farrow's new book 'Catch and Kill'\n\nAn internal investigation uncovered no claims or settlements associated with allegations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer before he was fired, Lack said.\n\nBut Farrow indicated that Lauer's behavior was an open secret at NBC. He quoted Lauer's former co-anchor Ann Curry - who left Today on bad terms with Lauer - saying she had told NBC executives that Lauer 'had a problem with women' and they had to keep an eye on him.\n\nFarrow said he'd learned of seven claims of sexual misconduct raised by women who worked with Lauer.\n\n'Several said they had told colleagues, and believed the network knew about the problem,' he wrote.\n\nHe quoted a former production assistant, Addie Collins, who told him Lauer aggressively pursued her in 2000 and 'ordered' her to perform sexual favors.\n\n'She'd consented, but it had made her feel sick, afraid for her job, afraid of retaliation,' Farrow wrote.\n\nLauer said that he had never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex.\n\nIn his letter, he said he ended his relationship with Nevils 'poorly', but that 'being upset or having second thoughts does not give anyone the right to make false accusations years later'.\n\nLauer acknowledged other extramarital encounters and criticized the women involved for having 'abandoned shared responsibility' for the affairs to shield themselves from blame behind false allegations.\n\n'They have avoided having to look at a boyfriend, a husband or a child in the eye and say, 'I cheated,'' Lauer said. 'And I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.'", "description": "Disgraced NBC anchor Matt Lauer and his former co-host Meredith\u00a0Vieira haven't spoken since he was abruptly fired from the Today show for sexual misconduct.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/03/19673778-0-image-a-55_1571019631106.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
