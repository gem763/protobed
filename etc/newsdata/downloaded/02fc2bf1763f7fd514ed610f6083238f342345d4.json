I adore him for the person that he is.\n\n'Whenever people confuse him for my father, we just laugh it off.'\n\nIn October 2015, Terri and Kirk, a retired military corporal, both attended a Comic-Con event in Swansea and became friends on Facebook the following day.\n\nTerri said: 'We didn't meet that day, but the next day, Kirk added me on Facebook.\n\n'I had no idea who he was because his photo was him in a Deadpool costume, so I couldn't see his face.\n\n'He told me he'd seen me at the Comic-Con event and we got chatting.\n\n'I then realised he lived one street away.'\n\nThe following day, Terri arranged to meet Kirk at a nearby shop, despite not knowing what he looked like, and found him to be 'incredibly charming and lovely'.\n\nTerri said: 'When I saw him for the first time, I could tell straight away that he was older.\n\n'He had a wrinkled smile and slightly greying hair but he was incredibly charming and lovely.\n\n'He told me he was 49, 27 years my senior, but I didn't care at all.\n\nTerri said that her partner's age did not matter to her as she adorned him for the person that he was\n\nFollowing a Comic-Con event in Swansea in October 2015, which Terri and Kirk had both attended, the pair became friends on Facebook\n\n'I discovered Kirk was a single dad to his son, and I told him I was a single mum to my daughter. We had so much in common.'\n\nFollowing their initial meeting, Terri and Kirk would meet with his son Mason, 11, and her daughter Olivia, seven, for play dates at their local park and four months later the pair became a couple.\n\nTerri continued: 'Soon I took on the role of stepmum to his son straight away.\n\n'Kirk also became a wonderful stepdad to Olivia.'\n\nTwo months later Terri broke the news of her new relationship to her mother, Beverly Foster, 44, who also works as a carer, and stepfather, Michael Foster, 47.\n\nShe said: 'Kirk was older than them both. They weren't happy at first and mum said Kirk was too old for me.\n\nTerri decided to arrange a meeting with Kirk at a nearby shop after the pair began interacting on social media\n\n'But once they met him, they saw how much I cared for him they were happy that I'd found love, and they really hit it off with Kirk.'\n\nThe following month, Kirk introduced Terri to his family, who accepted their love straight away.\n\nBut despite gaining the support of their families, Terri and Kirk faced an array of comments from strangers mocking their age-gap relationship.\n\nThe couple also recalled an awkward encounter at their GP clinic in September 2016, which saw Terri's doctor mistaking Kirk for her father.\n\nTerri said: 'I said Kirk was my partner and the doctor had the most confused look on his face.\n\n'It was actually quite funny seeing it register on his face.\n\nTerri said that it was sad that people continued to judge her and Kirk for their age-gap relationship\n\n'Kirk didn't mind, we just laughed.\n\n'After that, whenever Kirk and I went to the shops or for a walk with the kids, people gave us dirty looks.\n\n'It bothered me at first, but now I shrug it off.\n\n'Whenever I went out with the kids, lots of people assumed I was Mason's biological mum.\n\n'They all thought I'd had him at 14. I had to explain that I'm his step mum.\n\n'It's funny how strangers jump to conclusions.'\n\nDespite cruel taunts and judgement from strangers, the couple are happier than ever, with Terri adding that she had found her 'soul mate'.\n\nThe mother-of-one said that it didn't matter what the age difference was between her and her partner as 'love is love'\n\nTerri added: 'We are a perfect little family.\n\n'It's very sad that people out there judge others for being in an age gap relationship.\n\n'Whether it's a two-year difference or a 20-year difference, love is love.\n\n'It's doesn't matter how old Kirk is, I know he's my soul mate. And I don't care what anyone else thinks.'", "description": "Terri Foster-Guy, 26, and her partner Kirk Campbell, 53, both from South Wales, revealed that they often receive dirty looks from people in the street due to their age-gap relationship.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/09/19874328-0-image-a-4_1571386321443.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
