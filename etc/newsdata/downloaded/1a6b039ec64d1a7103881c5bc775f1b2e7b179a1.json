Americans For Prosperity wants to protect you from the grasping egos of Attorney Generals. It believes, you see, that \"consumers will be worse off if antitrust laws are used to advance a political agenda by threatening or breaking up successful companies.\"\n\nAnd there you were thinking that Facebook owning Instagram and WhatsApp was a bit much.\n\nThere you were thinking that if there were a lot more smaller tech companies, as opposed to a mere few monopolist types, there'd be more competition. Don't be silly.\n\nAlways playing politics, those attorneys general, you know. Unlike corporations like Google, Facebook, and the Koch Corporation, which strictly adhere to the pursuit of capital gains.\n\nUnless, that is, those pesky politicians get in the way. Then these corporations are forced to hire politically astute lobbyist bouncers to restore the natural order.\n\nLet's be honest, fairness doesn't seem such a popular concept these days. Yet in the Wall Street Journal, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton -- whose main interest is Google -- insisted he had no interest in threatening Google's size.\n\nInstead, this was a little bucolic exploration. Paxton said: \"The British pastor Charles Spurgeon once wrote that 'a village is a hive of glass, where nothing unobserved can pass.' We are simply asking Google to pull back the curtains and let us see if the village gates are truly open.\"\n\nIn Agatha Christie novels, when they pull back the curtains, there are always troubling skeletons to be found.\n\nPlease, I'm not here to state rights and wrongs, even if large companies rarely seem to enjoy actually competing fairly. Why, here's an article entitled: \"Explainer: Advertising executives point to five ways Google stifles business.\"\n\nI prefer to focus on the amusing image of Facebook and Google, supposed repositories of all things liberal, now holding hands and skipping down village pathways with the repository of singularly conservative thought, the Koch family.\n\nYou see, we can all work together.
