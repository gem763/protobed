The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, set to be branded Ervebo, is developed by developed by US drugmaker Merck and Co. It's been more than 97 per cent effective, according to a preliminary estimate published by WHO. Data release by WHO in April 2019 \u2014 the first to be released on how the vaccine is working in the outbreak \u2014 suggest a 'very impressive' performance. Only 71 out of 90,000 at-risk people who were vaccinated went on to develop Ebola. During the same time period, 880 cases occurred among at-risk individuals who had not received a jab. A total of 56 of those people developed symptoms fewer than 10 days after being vaccinated, suggesting the vaccine had not yet had time to fully protect them. It is believed it takes about 10 days for immune protection to develop after vaccination. It was created by scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, which is part of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).\n\n'This vaccine has already saved many lives in the current Ebola outbreak, and the decision by European regulator will help it to eventually save many more,' the WHO's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.\n\nThe Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,157 people since the middle of last year.\n\nIt is the second largest Ebola outbreak in history, after a 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300.\n\nThe Merck vaccine, which the company has now brand-named Ervebo, is likely to get a full marketing licence from the European Commission within a few weeks.\n\nUntil now it has been called the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, and began being administered when the outbreak began last August.\n\nIt was chosen because, in 2015, it was proven to be safe and effective in a study of more than 16,000 people in Africa, Europe and the US.\n\nThe jab protects against the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus - the one that most commonly causes outbreaks.\n\nA 'ring vaccination' approach traces people who may have been in contact with someone newly infected with Ebola.\n\nMerck said in a statement its priority now was to get regulatory approval of its Ervebo manufacturing site in Germany so that licensed supply of the vaccine 'can be used to support global public health preparedness.'\n\nThe vaccine, made by Merck, has already saved many lives in the current Ebola outbreak\n\nIn trials, the Merck-vaccine has been proven to be 97 per cent effective at protecting against the rapidly spreading virus, which is fatal in half of cases\n\nA second experimental second Ebola vaccine will be administered from the beginning of the month. Pictured, a health worker checks the temperature of a citizen at a crossing point\n\nThe shot is also being reviewed under a fast-track system by regulators in the United States, with a decision expected in the first quarter of next year.\n\nLast month, the World Health Organization (WHO) came under fire for restricting supplies of the shot to a fraction of the population.\n\nThe aid group Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym, MSF, slammed there had been 'largely insufficient' vaccination rates.\n\nA second experimental second Ebola vaccine, developed by drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, is planned to be introduced in the Congo.\n\nThe J&J vaccine had been rejected by DRC's former health minister Oly Ilunga, who cited the risks of introducing a new product in communities where mistrust of Ebola responders is already high.\n\nThe new Ad26-ZEBOV-GP vaccine will arrive in the eastern city of Goma, in North Kivu province, on October 18 and be used from the beginning of November.\n\nEbola virus causes haemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects.\n\nThere are currently no licensed treatments for the deadly infection, but scientists said in August they were a step closer to being able to cure it.\n\nTwo experimental drugs showed survival rates of as much as 90 per cent in a clinical trial in Congo.", "description": "The so-called\u00a0Merck vaccine was approved his afternoon and is likely to\u00a0get a full marketing licence from the European Commission within a few weeks.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/15/18823508-0-The_World_Health_Oganization_has_come_under_fire_for_restricting-a-7_1571409267829.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
