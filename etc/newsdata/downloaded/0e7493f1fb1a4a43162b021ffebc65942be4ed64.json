Yet a year later, the Constitutional Court authorized him to stand.\n\nBoth the TSE and Constitutional Court are made up of members appointed by Congress, where MAS has a majority.\n\nOne-time union leader Morales, his country's first ever indigenous president, was hugely popular until his referendum defeat.\n\nHe won the 2009 and 2014 elections with more than 60 percent of the vote.\n\nBut his popularity has waned amid allegations of corruption and authoritarianism.\n\nMorales points to a decade of economic stability and considerable industrialization as his achievements, while insisting he has brought \"dignity\" to Bolivia's indigenous population, the largest in Latin America.", "description": "Bolivia saw fresh clashes between rival groups, road blocks and demonstrations on Friday following the controversial reelection of President Evo Morales in a disputed vote that triggered riots and allegations of fraud from the opposition.
