If Kurdish forces did not retreat, Syrian border guards and Russian military police would have to fall back. \u201cAnd remaining Kurdish formations would then fall under the weight of the Turkish army,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a swipe at Washington, which has called into question how the deal will be guaranteed, Peskov said the United States had been the closest ally of the Kurdish fighters but had now betrayed them.\n\n\u201cNow they (the Americans) prefer to leave the Kurds at the border and almost force them to fight the Turks,\u201d he said in remarks to Russian news agencies.\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF were Washington\u2019s main allies in the fight to dismantle Islamic State\u2019s self-declared caliphate in Syria. Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out was criticized by U.S. lawmakers, including fellow Republicans, as a betrayal.\n\nIn a further sign of growing ties between Ankara and Moscow, which have alarmed the U.S. administration, the head of Russia\u2019s defence sales agency was quoted by the Interfax news agency on Wednesday as saying Moscow could deliver more S-400 missile defence systems to Turkey.\n\nTurkey, a NATO member, has already been frozen out of a programme to buy and help produce F-35 jets and faces possible U.S. sanctions for buying the S-400 systems, which Washington says are incompatible with NATO\u2019s defences and threaten the F-35 if operated near the stealth fighter.\n\nOvernight, Turkey\u2019s defence ministry said that the United States had told Ankara the YPG had completed its withdrawal from the area of Turkey\u2019s military offensive.\n\nThere was no need to initiate another operation outside the current area of operation at this stage, the ministry said, effectively ending a military offensive that began two weeks ago and drew global criticism.\n\nTURKEY REVIEWS MILITARY PLANS\n\nWhile Tuesday\u2019s deal in Sochi addresses Turkey\u2019s call for the YPG to be pushed back from the border, it also means Ankara will have to deepen its security coordination with Damascus after years of hostility between Erdogan and Assad.\n\nForeign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday that Turkey has no direct contact with Assad\u2019s government, but \u201cthere could be contact at the intelligence level, this is natural\u201d.\n\nThree Turkish officials told Reuters this week Ankara was already holding covert contacts with Damascus to avert direct conflict in northeast Syria.\n\nAnkara may also have to moderate its own military ambitions in the region. Turkish security sources said Ankara was re-evaluating a plan to set up 12 observation posts in northeastern Syria in the wake of the deal.\n\nTurkish soldiers on an infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) drive near the Turkish-Syrian border in Ceylanpinar, Turkey, October 22, 2019.
