Yes, launching a show on Quibi is bound to be an exciting adventure, hopefully as exciting as the logline for Sophie Turner\u2019s first post-Game of Thrones TV project, Survive. According to Variety, Turner stars as Jane, one of two survivors (get it? from the title?) of a plane crash, in a series based on the titular 2012 novel by Alex Morel.\n\nA plane crash is never great, but on the plus side, the other survivor is Corey Hawkins, of Straight Outta Compton, 24: Legacy and BlacKkKlansman fame. On the minus side again, the pair didn\u2019t crash-land somewhere convenient, like Cleveland or Sacramento, but instead find themselves stranded on a snow-covered mountain, from which they must \u201cembark on a harrowing journey out of the wilderness, battling brutal conditions and personal traumas.\u201d Mountain lions and avalanches are bad enough, but personal traumas too? Can\u2019t those wait until they find a ski resort or something? Hardly seems fair.", "description": "In her first post-Game of Thrones role, Sophie Turner and Corey Hawkins will star in Quibi\u2019s Survive, about two people who survive a plane crash.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/16-Sophie-Turner.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
