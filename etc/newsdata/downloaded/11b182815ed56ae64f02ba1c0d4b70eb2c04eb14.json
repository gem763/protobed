It affects my wife, my mum and dad, my brother, family, friends. It affects everyone.\n\n'It's a brutal disease with a horrible prognosis. That's the message we need to get across to people to help move forward.'\n\nStephen Darby, 31, was told he had the incurable neurological condition just months after getting married to England women's captain Steph Houghton (with him right) in 2018\n\nSpeaking at the launch of his charity, which he founded with fellow MND patient and Afghanistan veteran Chris Rimmer (with him at Bradford v Liverpool match in July), he detailed his progressive symptoms\n\nDarby today said that the disease has had an impact on everyone, including his wife. They are pictured on their wedding day above\n\nSpeaking at the launch of his charity, which he founded with fellow MND patient and Afghanistan veteran Chris Rimmer, he detailed his progressive symptoms.\n\nHe said: 'Physically, I've got hand weakness and my arms are weak at the moment.\n\n'But I'd say a year after being diagnosed I'm not doing too bad.\n\n'Life expectancy is normally two to five years for anyone with MND. A third of those people die within a year, that's obviously quite tough.'\n\nDarby's condition saw him retire from football at 29. His friend and fellow charity founder Chris Rimmer medically retired from the Army at 32 in 2015.\n\nThe couple are pictured together at Bradford City v Liverpool in Bradford in July this year\n\nChoking back tears, Darby said the launch of his charitable foundation was an 'emotional day'.\n\nHe hopes it will raise much-need funds and awareness to help manage and even cure the condition.\n\nDespite battling the aggressive disease, the 31-year-old was there every step of the way when his wife was fighting for World Cup glory in France this summer.\n\nHe was on the sidelines cheering her on when they were beaten by the USA in the semi-final.\n\nHoughton has hinted she may give up her career if her husband's condition worsens.\n\nShe said in a previous interview: 'He's my priority. If anything were to change in the near future, my job is to be the best wife I can and look after him.'\n\nDarby was treated for another condition for a year before doctors started testing for MND.\n\nEighteen months in he was finally given the devastating news.\n\nDescribing his symptoms on the charity's website he writes: Over the course of the last 2 and a half years, symptoms have been progressing slowly. I\n\n'I have weakness in both hands and twitching in my arms, legs, chest and tongue.'\n\nHe added: 'Starting the foundation was a way of turning something so devastating into something positive.\n\n'To have a positive impact on MND and to help those individuals and families living through it to support them.'\n\nThe ex-Bradford City and Bolton Wanderers star (pictured with wife Steph right) says the 'brutal disease' and its 'terrible prognosis' of two to five years is having a devastating effect on his family", "description": "Stephen Darby, 31, was told he had the incurable neurological condition just months after getting married to England women's captain Steph Houghton in 2018.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/20/20255084-0-image-a-5_1572209114128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
