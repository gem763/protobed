(AP) - Tua Tagovailoa threw for a career-high 444 yards and tied his personal best with five touchdowns to help No. 2 Alabama open Southeastern Conference play with a 47-23 victory over South Carolina on Saturday.\n\nCoach Nick Saban improved to 12-1 at Alabama in SEC openers and wiped away some bad memories of his last visit to Williams-Brice Stadium nine years ago.\n\nTagovailoa and his receivers quickly got the Crimson Tide (3-0, 1-0) rolling with first-quarter TD passes of 24 yards to Najee Harris and 81 yards to Henry Ruggs III. Whenever the Gamecocks (1-2, 0-1) drew within range, Tagovailoa came right back to restore Alabama\u2019s edge.\n\nHarris added a 42-yard catch-and-run score where he broke two tackles and leaped over defensive back R.J. Roderick on the way to the end zone. DeVonta Smith caught Tagovailoa\u2019s last TD pass, also for 42 yards.\n\nFor Alabama to reach its goals, Saban said the Tide will have run the ball more effectively. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we\u2019re a great passing team,\u201d he said. \u201cI also think from a team standpoint, we need to be able to run the ball well.\u201d\n\nThe Crimson Tide finished with 76 yards rushing against 495 passing.\n\nSaban reminded his players, about all who were in middle or elementary school in 2010, of the Tides\u2019 previous game here when the top-ranked Tide were soundly beaten 35-21.\n\nAnd the Gamecocks tried anything they could to pull off another miracle, but little worked - especially with Tagovailoa in complete control.\n\nParker White\u2019s fake field goal run to the end zone was called back because of holding. Alabama snuffed out a fake punt to stop the Gamecocks well short of a first down. And when South Carolina drove to Alabama\u2019s 1 on the final play of the half, freshman Ryan Hilinski\u2019s pass to the back of the end zone was off target.\n\nTagovailoa\u2019s passing yards were the third most in school history. He bettered his previous mark of 387 yards against Texas A&M; and tied his personal best for touchdowns set against Auburn, both of those coming in 2018.\n\nSmith and Ruggs both surpassed 100 yards receiving. Smith had 136 yards on eight catches, including two TDs. Ruggs had six catches for 122 yards.\n\nSouth Carolina coach Will Muschamp said his team\u2019s errors near the goal line - Hilinski threw high on one fourth-and-goal and threw an interception into the end zone - cost them the chance to keep things closer.\n\n\u201cI thought we made some nice drives today, but we didn\u2019t get what we wanted and that\u2019s to win the game,\u201d he said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nAlabama: The Crimson Tide played a game sure to please Saban: Good enough to win by double-digits but with enough mistakes on defense for him to drill into players before next week. Alabama allowed a 300-yard passer and a 100-yard rusher, both benchmarks Saban will likely hone in going forward.\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks showed some pluck in the face of the defending national champions. Freshman quarterback Ryan Hilinski threw for 324 yards and two touchdowns in his second career game with expected starter in injured Jake Bentley lost for the season.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nAlabama\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t perfect, but it should certainly keep the Tide at No. 2 without major upheaval in the rankings.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAlabama returns home to another daytime kickoff when it plays Southern Miss on Saturday.\n\nSouth Carolina plays its first SEC road game when it faces Missouri on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tua Tagovailoa threw for a career-high 444 yards and tied his personal best with five touchdowns to help No. 2 Alabama open Southeastern Conference play with a 47-23 victory over South Carolina on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pete Iacobelli"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/aptopix_south_carolina_alabama_football_90151_c0-160-3832-2394_s1770x1032.jpg?d30ed4d3b695839271bfe068bdcb2c1406fb5e37", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
