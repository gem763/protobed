(May 16) AP, AP\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he bears responsibility for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi because \u201cIt happened under my watch.\u201d in an excerpted interview from an upcoming documentary series.\n\n\"It happened under my watch,\" the Saudi leader told PBS FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith on the sidelines of an electric car race near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \u201cI get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch.\u201d\n\nHe insisted, though, that he had no involvement or knowledge in the killing.\n\n\"We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees,\" he replied, when asked how the murder could have happened without his knowledge.\n\nWhen pressed further, and asked how the killers could have used Saudi planes to fly between Saudi Arabia and Turkey to commit the murder, Prince Mohammed said, \"I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they\u2019re responsible, they have the authority to do that.\"\n\nKhashoggi's brutal murder last October inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul prompted an international outcry and calls from some American lawmakers to alter American foreign policy on Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi was a columnist for the Washington Post and a U.S. resident.\n\nSaudi officials had previously denied any involvement or knowledge in the killing, which reportedly involved Khashoggi's dismemberment. His body has never been found.\n\nMore: Why grisly UN report on Khashoggi murder will not change Trump policy toward Saudi Arabia\n\nMore: What the UN wants next in the investigation of Jamal Khashoggi's murder\n\nMore: Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee says 'nothing has been done' about his killing\n\nLater reports linked the killers to the Saudi Arabian government, in particular, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\n\nThe U.S. sanctioned 17 Saudi nationals for their alleged roles in the killing, but President Donald Trump vetoed a push by lawmakers to bar some weapons sales to Saudi Arabia in response to the killing.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/09/26/mbs-jamal-khashoggis-murder-happened-under-my-watch/3772626002/", "description": "\u201cI get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch,\u201d Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in an excerpted interview, though he denied direct knowledge.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Published A.M.
