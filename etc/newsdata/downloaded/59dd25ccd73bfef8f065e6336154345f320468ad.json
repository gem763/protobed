He signed a multiyear deal with the mixed-martial-arts firm, made his debut in 2019, and already has two dominant first-round-submission wins under his belt.\n\nOn Friday, at the Bellator 231 event in Uncasville, Connecticut, the self-described \"corn-fed\" fighter competes for the third time.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 275-pound 37-year-old is expected to beat his opponent, Anthony Garrett. Speaking with Business Insider this week, Hager said also expected to win and even believes his background in professional wrestling will be a huge asset on fight night.\n\nHager's arrival has been met with resistance, though, perhaps because of the high-profile failure of CM Punk \u2014 a WWE guy who tried to compete in UFC but lost twice.\n\nHager finds the backlash amusing. \"It doesn't piss me off at all, I think it's laughable because if I didn't have that decade at the WWE doing sports entertainment, I wouldn't be here in this position with Bellator,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nHager as Jack Swagger, working with the WWE superstar John Cena.

And as a professional fighter, as a professional wrestler, that is something we are all battling for. We want to make our brand a name brand and a household name. And that essentially gives us more leverage and helps us provide for our families.\n\n\"So when people say silly things like that, it really is in one ear and out the other because they wish they had my background and my exposure.\n\n\"And, honestly, that's why I didn't shy away from it,\" Hager said. \"In my first fight, I acknowledged it. I'm a professional wrestler, this is who I am, who you know me as. But guess what, I've also been wrestling since I was 5 years old \u2014 real wrestling \u2014 amateur wrestling, Olympic wrestling.\n\n\"I grew up in one of the most prolific high-school-wrestling programs in the country, and MMA fighters are more successful when they have that amateur-wrestling background.\"\n\nHager's high-school team was like the New England Patriots of wrestling\n\nHager's background at the Perry High School in Oklahoma is impressive. The MMA and wrestling reporter Dave Meltzer at MMA Fighting earlier this year described Hager as a \"freak athlete\" and someone \"practically born on the mat.\" It is perhaps no surprise he ended up at a school that was small but dominant.\n\nSo dominant was Hager's high school that it was like the New England Patriots or Real Madrid of wrestling. And, just like the Pats and Los Blancos, they became hated, jeered, and booed because they were serial, unapologetic winners.\n\n\"We were. We really were,\" Hager said, agreeing with the Patriots comparison. \"We're a small school but hold the most state championships [56] of all schools in America. I graduated with 97 people, but there's high schools that have thousands and thousands in their graduating classes, so just a little perspective on how competitive we were.\"\n\nHager and his wrestling squad had such a reputation and were so hated that it still makes him smile to this day. \"Out of the 14 weights, we would put 13 in the finals,\" he said. \"When you're in an amateur-wrestling match, and they're booing \u2026 it still puts a smile on my face.\"\n\nHager still hears the boos. After his last victory, an arm-triangle choke over T.J. Jones in May, the crowd turned on him because he appeared to hold onto the submission even after Jones tapped. Hager hit back at the fans when he got on the mic to cut his post-fight promo, challenging fans to boo all they want.\n\n\"It's all good business,\" he said. \"It was real emotion coming out there, coming from the fans. It's kind of like us colliding. They don't have a microphone, so I could say it louder, which always wins.\n\n\"The best time to cut a promo is after a fight. You have all that adrenaline, all that machismo coming out. Everybody wants to think I was just playing, turning heel or whatever, it was just real emotion. And they really needed to shut up.\"\n\nHager's extraordinary self-belief is rooted in being a winner\n\nHager and Anthony Garrett. Bellator MMA\n\nMeltzer said Hager in MMA was similar to Brock Lesnar, the former WWE superstar who competed in UFC and won the heavyweight championship.\n\nHager even has an amateur-wrestling victory over Cain Velasquez, another accomplished UFC champion who, incidentally, crossed over into professional wrestling and features on WWE's upcoming Saudi Arabia show, \"Crown Jewel,\" competing against Lesnar in a singles match for the WWE Championship.\n\n\"Cain and I wrestled two times, we split 1-1,\" Hager said. \"The first time we wrestled, it went into six or seven overtimes. It was like a 23 minute amateur-wrestling match. Just, like, longer than you can imagine any amateur-wrestling match.\n\n\"A normal amateur match is seven minutes,\" he said. \"And this one went 23. Everybody knows the gas tank Cain has, and I ended up taking him down in overtime, so he got tired with me, and I'll definitely hold that as a badge of honor because his gas tank is so impressive. You see what he does in the cage, never quits, has that look on his face, nonstop. It was a great battle.\n\n\"It was definitely one of the things I keep my eye on, see these guys go in there and do very well in the cage. At first, I wondered, 'Oh, he had a boxing background growing up,' or, 'Oh, he did jiujitsu,' but a lot of the times I saw guys make the transition.\n\n\"Ryan Bader is a great example of that. He was the 197-pounder in Arizona State when Cain was there. You see how he fought in UFC, signed in Bellator, almost like a different fighter. He's so comfortable; he's knocking out legends. It's exciting to see what amateur wrestlers can do.\n\n\"The main thing that made me want to get into it was the opportunity. I knew I could compete. I'd watch heavyweight athletes and knew I was as good an athlete as these guys. I could compete with these guys. And, oh man, with my amateur-wrestling background, what a huge opportunity would that be to crossover and capitalize on.\"\n\nAgainst Garrett on Friday's Bellator 231 show, Hager said it was \"corn-fed guys looking to collide,\" adding, \"He's going to want to try to get me up against the cage, bull me around a little bit, and we've been training for that specifically.\"\n\nAfter Friday, he wants another fight in 2019, more fights in 2020, and is targeting the Bellator heavyweight championship \u2014 a title Bader holds.\n\n\"It's an incredible time right now,\" Hager said. \"My team have been planning this since I left the WWE three years ago, and really, the ball is in our corner. We can do what we want. We're undefeated. The sky is limit.\n\n\"I think anybody who steps in the cage has this innate quality where they want to be the best, go after the championship, and have their hand held. So of course I've got my eye on that. From the beginning, make no mistakes, I'm a prizefighter and doing this for the money. Money first. And then championships.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nIreland's next top boxer has a rare shot at retribution after losing at the Olympics because of a 'fixed' fight: 'It's personal for my career, my legacy'\n\nAn Irish boxer is challenging Conor McGregor to 'stay sober' long enough so they can end their war of words and fight for a world title\n\nThe real Tyson Fury is quiet, shy, and introverted, according to an Irish boxer who knows him well\n\nConor McGregor is linked with comeback bouts against 4 fighters only weeks after being considered an 'irrelevant' has-been\n\nA second successive loss could finish Carl Frampton, but he fights to be called Ireland's greatest boxer: 'It's make or break'", "description": "Jake Hager wants to keep on winning in Bellator until he is in a position where he can fight Ryan Bader for the heavyweight title.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db2347fdee01938e3705816?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
