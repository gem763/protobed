Democrats are gathering evidence of alleged misconduct by the president and planning hearings in hopes of deciding by the end of the year whether to recommend his impeachment to the full House of Representatives.\n\nLast month, the committee subpoenaed testimony from Trump's former campaign chairman Corey Lewandowski and two White House aides. The three men were cited in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report as witnesses to actions by which Democrats say Trump sought to obstruct the probe.\n\nMueller also documented the role of pardons in alleged efforts by Trump to dissuade his former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former lawyer Michael Cohen from cooperating with federal investigators.\n\nIn addition to possible obstruction and pardon dangling, the House committee is investigating alleged hush payments made before the 2016 presidential election to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump and the president's business dealings that could violate constitutional restrictions against officials receiving profits from foreign and domestic governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Eric Beech and David Morgan; Editing by Leslie Adler, Tom Brown and Sonya Hepinstall)", "description": "The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Wednesday subpoenaed the Department of Homeland Security for documents that could shed light on President Donald Trump's alleged offer of pardons to officials implementing U.S. immigration policy.
