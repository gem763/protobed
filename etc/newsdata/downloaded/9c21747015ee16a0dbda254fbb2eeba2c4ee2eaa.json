Labour warned the proposals put the Good Friday Agreement in jeopardy, while the SNP and Lib Dems claimed they were \u201cdesigned to fail\u201d and push the country towards a no-deal exit.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Mr Johnson was hit by fresh claims over his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, with a former aide alleging the PM asked for his friend to be included in a trade trip to Israel while he was mayor of London.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the Belfast High Court ruled that the country's abortion restrictions breached the UK's human rights law.
