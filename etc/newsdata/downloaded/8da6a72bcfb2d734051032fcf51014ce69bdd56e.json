What she can\u2019t do is take part in, or create custom floral arrangements celebrating sacred events that violate her religious beliefs,\u201d said Kristen Waggoner, an attorney with ADF.\n\nThe legal battle began when Ms. Stutzman refused to provide flowers for one of her longtime customers after learning it was for a same-sex wedding ceremony. The couple, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, sued Ms. Stutzman as did the state of Washington.\n\nThe ACLU and a spokesperson for the state of Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Times.\n\nIn her petition to the Supreme Court, Ms. Stutzman argues Washington\u2019s Attorney General Bob Ferguson has been hostile towards Christians, saying he took her to court but refused to bring any action against a gay coffee-shop owner, who allegedly removed a group of Christians from his store after disagreeing with their religious views.\n\nMs. Stutzman\u2019s case is not the only one pending in courts across the country that is testing the limits between LGBT rights and the First Amendment\u2019s protection of free speech and religious liberty.\n\nWedding calligraphers in Phoenix had to go to court over concerns they would be forced to create signs celebrating same-sex weddings in conflict with their faith since they provide wedding signs with scripture, celebrating the union of a man and a woman.\n\nAnd a film studio in Minnesota has been fighting a legal battle to enter the wedding business in a way that conforms to their Christian view of marriage.\n\n\u201cReligious people should be free to live out their beliefs about marriage,\u201d Ms. Stutzman\u2019s attorneys argue in her appeal to the high court.\n\n\u201cOnly this court can resolve the numerous First Amendment conflicts these issues have created,\u201d the petition reads.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
