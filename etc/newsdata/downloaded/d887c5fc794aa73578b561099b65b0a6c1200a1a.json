The purchases, coupled with continued repo operations, are meant to quell liquidity pressures, and \"do not represent a change\" to the Fed's monetary policy position, the bank said in a statement.\n\nRead more: Why a $60 billion investing firm thinks unloved value stocks represent the best market opportunity in 20 years\n\nThe Fed president also responded to claims that President Trump has influenced policy through tweets and spoken criticism. Trump has repeatedly pressured the Fed to lower interest rates, a move that's reinforced the central bank's nonpartisan status.\n\n\"The louder the politics gets turned up, the more we hug data and analysis,\" Kashkari told Axios.\n\nHe added that he \"will likely be in favor\" of voting for a rate cut during the Federal Open Market Committee meeting slated for October 29.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nEarnings season kick off this week.
