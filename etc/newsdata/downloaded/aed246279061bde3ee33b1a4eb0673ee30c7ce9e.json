On Monday defence minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva called the situation \"exaggerated\" and denied the fires were out of control.\n\nIt's estimated that nearly 50,000 Amazon blazes have ignited this month alone, 89 per cent more than in August 2018 on a scale not seen since 2010.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

in the months since.\n\nPreliminary data from Brazil\u2019s National Space Research Institute suggested huge recorded rises in deforestation in July (278 per cent) and August (118 per cent).\n\n\"What came down in July and August will burn in September and October,\" he said. \"The worst of the fire is yet to come.\"\n\nMr Azevedo called the inferno \"no accident\", saying the ignition was nearly always a human action.\n\n\"It is part of the dynamics of deforestation in tropical regions,\" he wrote in Portuguese. \"First, they pull down the big trees; then [divert] the river to clear the lower vegetation; and after a few weeks of drying, a fire is set to finish the job.\"\n\nBBC Brazil analysis analysis suggested the number of environmental fines handed out since Mr Bolsonaro took office had fallen to a ten-year low, dropping 29.4 per cent from the previous year.\n\nMr Azevedo, who is now coordinator of deforestation tracking network MapBiomas, urged serious action to stop further devastation.\n\nHe urged a moratorium on the use of fire continue until the end of the dry season, with a large-scale communication campaign to discourage its use in agriculture.\n\nIn conservation units and indigenous territories particularly, law enforcement should come down hard on illegal logging and mining, he said, seizing tools and machinery and destroying them if necessary.\n\nSuch measures would be a sharp about-turn for Mr Bolsonaro's government.\n\nHe campaigned last year on a platform to hugely expand development in the Amazon, often dubbed the \"lungs of the Earth\", championing deforestation to make way for soy bean and cattle farms.\n\nCritics warn that such projects not only threaten the extinction of thousands of creatures - 10 per cent of the world's known species reside in the jungle - but the existence of centuries-old indigenous peoples.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s integrate these citizens and bring value to all Brazilians,\u201d he tweeted the day after his inauguration.\n\nOn Wednesday, accused Germany and France of trying to \"buy\" Brazil's sovereignty, rejecting the G7's offer of \u00a320m in emergency funds.\n\nBut he confirmed that Latin America's Amazon countries would meet in September to discuss both protecting and developing the rainforest region.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "The Brazilian government's
