Greed, and greed alone.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nThere\u2019s a common thread that stretches forward from Donald Trump\u2019s financial scandals of the 1980s to his damning phone call with the president of Ukraine.\n\nIt\u2019s the self-dealing.\n\nWherever he was, whatever his title, the president has used the powers at his disposal to enrich or otherwise benefit himself, regardless of what law, fiduciary duty or oath of office bound him to do.\n\nTrump ran his campaign in 2016 on a single premise: greed. (Okay, two premises: greed and racism.) He boasted to his fans about his (inflated) wealth and gilded lifestyle, both products of clever deployments of his avarice. It was a trait he promised, paradoxically, that he\u2019d apply more altruistically once elected.\n\n\u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve been greedy, greedy, greedy,\u201d he said at a January 2016 rally. \u201cI\u2019ve grabbed all the money I could get. I\u2019m so greedy. But now I want to be greedy for the United States. I want to grab all that money. I\u2019m going to be greedy for the United States.\u201d\n\nHis track record suggested that would be unlikely, perhaps impossible \u2014 in part because his life has always been about blurring lines between personal gain and professional or legal responsibilities.\n\nThis was the case when the Trump family set up a shell company called All County Building Supply & Maintenance in the early 1990s, to pretend to purchase boilers, cleaning supplies and other building equipment from (real) vendors. This middleman, which existed only on paper, then \u201cresold\u201d everything at an inflated price to the Trump Organization. The purpose of the shell company was to allow Trump\u2019s father, Fred, to transfer huge cash gifts to his children as though they were ordinary business transactions. This helped the Trump family evade a 55 percent estate tax, as the New York Times reported last year.\n\nIt was also the case from the 1980s through the past presidential campaign, as Trump siphoned funds from his charity for his personal benefit. He used Trump Foundation money to settle legal disputes involving his for-profit companies, to renovate a fountain outside one of his hotels and to buy enormous portraits of himself, as my Post colleague David A. Fahrenthold documented.\n\nIt was likewise the case when his once-publicly-traded company, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, inflated financial results in a way that the Securities and Exchange Commission said served to mislead investors. And also when his private company allegedly provided false sales figures for real estate developments in Mexico, Panama, Toronto and New York.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSuch cases repeatedly showed that Trump had no problem draining money from bondholders, investors or tax coffers if he thought he could get away with it. They also illustrated exactly how he might govern as president: in his own interest.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters shrugged off his refusal to divest from his business interests, arguing that it didn\u2019t matter if he continued to make money while president so long as he still did right by the country. But we knew at some point he\u2019d have to decide between a policy that benefited the country and one that benefited himself.\n\nAnd we knew which choice he\u2019d make.\n\nSo it was no surprise that his administration abruptly canceled the planned relocation of the FBI headquarters, which might have allowed the existing site to be redeveloped into a hotel that would compete with the nearby Trump International Hotel.\n\nOr that foreign leaders and business executives have patronized this and other Trump properties around the world, in a transparent attempt to influence U.S. policy on aid, arms deals and merger approvals. In fact, during their now-infamous July 25 call, the Ukrainian president made sure to note a recent stay at a Trump property in New York.\n\nIt\u2019s likewise shocking, but not altogether surprising, that military personnel have had unnecessary layovers at Trump\u2019s Scottish resort. Or that Vice President Pence stayed at the president\u2019s Irish resort while attending meetings 180 miles away. Or that the Secret Service has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at a single Trump hotel \u2014 in Washington.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of stuff that worried those who wrung their hands about his shady, self-dealing, private-sector past.\n\nMoreover, given Trump\u2019s rampant small-time grifting in public, it seemed impossible to imagine he wouldn\u2019t go after bigger fish in private \u2014 including, say, extorting a foreign power into smearing a political rival.\n\nTrump maintains that his call with the Ukrainian president was \u201cperfect.\u201d And, hey, maybe he genuinely believes this. Indeed, the best defense you can give for Trump\u2019s actions is that after all these years he has become incapable of telling the difference between his own interests and anyone else\u2019s \u2014 and by extension, what it means to be \u201cgreedy\u201d for himself vs. \u201cgreedy\u201d for the United States.\n\nPerhaps for Trump, as for France\u2019s Louis XIV, \u201cl\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi.\u201d", "description": "Wherever he was, whatever his title, the president has used the powers at his disposal to enrich or otherwise benefit himself.", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Columnist Covering Economics", "Public Policy", "Politics", "September At Pm", "Catherine Rampell Is An Opinion Columnist At The Washington Post.
