Photograph: William Collins\n\nHe also says a second referendum may be necessary to break the deadlock and criticises Johnson\u2019s move to prorogue Parliament and strip 21 Tory MPs of the whip for rebelling.\n\nSpeaking from his London home, Cameron told Andrew Billen: \u201cI think about this every day. Every single day I think about it, the referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next.\u201d\n\nAsked if he found sleeping hard, he said: \u201cI worry about it a lot. I worry about it a lot.\u201d\n\nHe said he had been under political pressure to hold a referendum in 2016 because there had been a series of treaties and the \u201cissue was not going to go away\u201d, adding he thought about it more than any other decision he made in government.\n\nHe reserves his most stinging criticism for his former Tory colleagues Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who were instrumental in the Vote Leave campaign. He said the pair had left him feeling like he was \u201cin a quagmire\u201d. In the book he calls Gove \u201cmendacious\u201d and says the pair behaved \u201cappallingly\u201d.\n\nIn the interview, Cameron said Gove\u2019s threat of Turkey joining the EU was \u201cridiculous\u201d and accused him of creating a false narrative.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment when I think it was Penny Mordaunt said on a Sunday morning show: \u2018We have no power to stop Turkey joining the EU\u2019.
