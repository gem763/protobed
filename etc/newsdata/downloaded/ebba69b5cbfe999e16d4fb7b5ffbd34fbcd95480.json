(And if you're not sure how to submit a story to us, here's a handy guide.)\n\nIf you join, and hone your skills, you could meet stars and inspiring people, participate in workshops like dim sum making or flight simulation, get up close and personal with professional journalists, write on a regular basis and get your stories published.\n\nHow to join\n\nTo register, click HERE\n\nFees\n\nThere are none.\n\nHow it works\n\nWe know you're busy, which is why we don't ask our Junior Reporters for any committment. All you need to do is go to the sign up page and fill in a few basic details. That will put you on our club list, and then you will start to get emails from us. We have workshops and press-previews galore, and if you see one you fancy, sign up. Places are limited, though, and so you might have to gain some experience on some of the less exciting stuff before you get to interview VIPs. Not to worry, we regularly hold workshops to teach you the skills you'll need.\n\nFrom the basics, how to write a news story, to the more pressured \"live reporting\" you will be able to upskill as you go. Be warned, though, if you are accepted on to an assignment, and you flake (i.e. don't pitch up and let us know only at the last minute) you might find that next time you will have to do a few more basic assignments again.\n\nWho can join?\n\nAnyone, anywhere in the world as long as you are older than 11 and younger than 21. However, if you are not in Hong Kong, you will not be able to take advantage of all the learning we facilitate.\n\nWhy there is an age limit\n\nWe're sorry if you are too young to join us now, really we are. But there are a whole lot of reasons we have to limit both ends of the age range.\n\nWhich skills are we looking for?\n\nWriters, photographers, filmakers and video editors, reviewers, illustrators, teamplayers, group gatherers, and all creative people. You don't even have to be good at English. In fact, learning to work with news is a great way to polish your English, and meet new friends along the way.\n\nHow do I know if my application has been successful?\n\nWe usually deal with new applications once a week, so don\u2019t expect an answer straight away. Once we\u2019ve taken care of your application, you will receive a welcome email with more details about the club and we will be asked to fill in some forms to sort out copyright issues. It is very important that you complete those forms and send them to us before you start submitting articles and participating in YP workshops.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t received an answer after two weeks, kindly send a reminder to the Reporters Club email at reporters.club@scmp.com\n\nWhat happens after I apply?\n\nOnce your application has been confirmed and you have sent back the forms, you can submit your story ideas by sending an email to reporters.club@scmp.com. Take a look to see how to pitch an idea and other ways to contribute to the newspaper.\n\nJunior reporters can also meet up to discuss their ideas with the YP team. To check when the next editorial meeting is, head over to our events calendar. Reporters are invited to the meeting by email.\n\nDuring the meeting, you will need to pitch story ideas, so come prepared, with at least three ideas. If we pick your idea, you will then need to organise interviews and sometimes photos for your story. The YP team will give you a deadline according to your school work. It will either be published in the print edition of Young Post or on yp.scmp.com.\n\nSometimes, just like in a real newsroom, we will assign you stories. If you\u2019re not able to come to the editorial meeting, check your inbox.\n\nWorkshops\n\nYoung Post usually organises upskill workshops for its junior reporters on public holidays and during school breaks. To check what\u2019s next and sign up, visit the events calendar.\n\nThe Junior Reporters Club certificate programme\n\nCertificates of achievement will be awarded to junior reporters who have significantly contributed to Young Post.\n\nThere are three levels of awards: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. The certificates will be mailed to junior reporters once they have written a certain number of articles and features.\n\nBronze Silver Gold JR Club Reports 5 10 15 Column contributions (Top 10, Talking Points, etc) 5 10 15 Cover stories or features 1 3 5 News articles 1 3 5\n\nJunior Reporters Club Reports\n\nJunior reporters can write a short report about an event organised by Junior Reporters Club. Check out the Junior reporters section for some examples.\n\nColumn contributions\n\nJunior reporters can contribute to weekly columns in Young Post, such as Top 10 and Talking Points.\n\nCover stories or features\n\nIf you have a story idea which you think will be interesting for Hong Kong students, then you can pitch your idea in editorial meetings or to the junior reporters\u2019 manager. Your pitch must answer the 5 Ws and 1 H (who, what, when, where, why, how) and explain why you think it\u2019ll be interesting to Hong Kong students.\n\nNews articles\n\nAs (junior) reporters, you should be on the look-out to report on anything newsworthy happening at your school or around you. You must include in your article what happened, when it happened, where it happened, who was involved, and try to answer why and how it happened. Check out our news section for some examples.\n\n\n\nTips\n\nYou have an idea, but you're not sure it's a good one? You're having some difficulties with your assignment?
