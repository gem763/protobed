Some cancellations had already been announced, but many were \u201cfresh\u201d. According to the Civil Aviation Authority, if less than two weeks\u2019 notice is given of a cancelled flight, the airline must pay cash compensation.\n\nA spokesperson for British Airways said: \u201cWe are very sorry for the disruption Balpa's industrial action has caused our customers.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything we can to get back to normal and to get our customers to their destinations.\u201d\n\nBesides the loss of pay for striking pilots, staff travel privileges have been withdrawn by BA.\n\nThe general secretary of the pilots\u2019 union, Brian Strutton, said: \u201cSurely any reasonable employer would listen to such a clear message, stop threatening and bullying, and start working towards finding a solution?\u201d\n\nWith no sign of an imminent agreement, Balpa is continuing with its plan another stoppage later this month.\n\nThe airline is expected to start sending out cancellation notifications today or tomorrow for the 27 September walk-out.\n\nAffected passengers are entitled to a flight on another airline on the same day as originally planned, if a seat is available.\n\nTravellers can alternatively choose a full refund or a flight on British Airways on a different day.", "description": "The most damaging strike in British Airways\u2019 history ended at midnight, but disruption continues \u2013 with more than 50 fresh flight cancellations to and from London Heathrow.
