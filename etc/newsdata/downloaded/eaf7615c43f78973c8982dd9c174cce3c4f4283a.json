REUTERS/Sertac Kayar/File Photo\n\nAnkara says it plans to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d to resettle millions of refugees currently living on Turkish soil. This would then serve as a buffer against what Turkey sees as its main security threat in Syria - Kurdish YPG fighters who Ankara says are linked to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nTurkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran all have large Kurdish minorities seeking varying degrees of autonomy from central governments after decades of repression.\n\nThis is an overview of their status.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Kurdish ethnic minority, mainly Sunni Muslims, speaks a language related to Farsi and lives mostly in a mountainous region straddling the borders of Armenia, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey.\n\nKurdish nationalism stirred in the 1890s when the Ottoman Empire was on its last legs. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres, which imposed a settlement and colonial carve-up of Turkey after World War One, promised them independence.\n\nThree years later, Turkish leader Kemal Ataturk tore up that accord. The Treaty of Lausanne, ratified in 1924, divided the Kurds among the new nations of the Middle East.\n\nSYRIA\n\nBefore Syria\u2019s popular uprising erupted in 2011, Kurds formed 8-10 percent of the population.\n\nThe Baathist state, championing Arab nationalism, had deprived thousands of Kurds of citizenship rights, banned their language and clamped down on Kurdish political activity.\n\nDuring the war, President Bashar al-Assad focused on crushing mainly Sunni Arab rebels with the help of Russia and Iran, turning a blind eye as Kurdish fighters carved out self-rule across the north and east.\n\nKurdish forces have emerged among the biggest winners, controlling about a quarter of the country \u2014 territory rich in oil, water and farmland. It is the biggest chunk of Syria not in state hands, now with its own forces and bureaucracy.\n\nAssad has said he will recover the northeast, but the two sides have kept some channels open.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG militia\u2019s power grew after joining forces with U.S. troops to seize territory from Islamic State. While the U.S. deployment has provided a security umbrella that helped Kurdish influence expand, Washington opposes the autonomy plans.\n\nSyrian Kurdish leaders say they do not seek partition but rather regional autonomy as part of Syria. Faced with the threat of a Turkish attack, the Kurdish-led authority in northern Syria has declared a state of \u201cgeneral mobilization\u201d across north and east Syria.\n\nTURKEY\n\nKurds form about 20 percent of the population.\n\nThe Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) took up arms against the state in 1984, waging an insurgency for autonomy in Turkey\u2019s largely Kurdish southeast. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.\n\nPKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured in 1999, tried and sentenced to death. That was later reduced to life in prison after Turkey abolished the death penalty.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has removed restrictions on using the Kurdish language. The government held talks with Ocalan, who is in jail on an island near Istanbul, in 2012, but they broke down and the conflict has revived.\n\nThe United States, the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist organization.\n\nTurkey\u2019s military has often struck targets in Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region near the PKK\u2019s stronghold in the Qandil mountains.\n\nErdogan has said he will crush Syria\u2019s YPG, which Ankara sees as a branch of the PKK, and has sent troops into northern Syria to mount offensives rolling back the Kurdish fighters.\n\nIRAQ\n\nKurds form 15-20 percent of the population, mainly inhabiting the three northern provinces of Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nLate President Saddam Hussein\u2019s rule targeted Iraqi Kurds in the late 1980s when chemical gas was used, villages were razed and thousands of Kurds were forced into camps.\n\nTheir region has been semi-autonomous since 1991, has its own regional government and armed forces, but still relies on the Baghdad central government for its budget.\n\nWhen Islamic State militants swept through much of northern Iraq in 2014, Kurdish fighters exploited the collapse of central authority to take control of Kirkuk, the oil city they regard as their ancient regional capital, as well as other territory disputed by Baghdad and the Kurdish north.\n\nIraqi government forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, with U.S. backing, defeated Islamic State which had captured swathes of northern Iraq.\n\nIraq\u2019s Kurds held a referendum on independence in September 2017, which backfired and triggered a regional crisis in the face of opposition from Baghdad and regional powers.\n\nThe vote prompted military and economic retaliation from Baghdad, which retook the territory seized by Kurdish forces since 2014. Ties have since improved, but tensions remain over oil exports and revenue-sharing.\n\nIRAN\n\nKurds form about 10 percent of the population.\n\nIn 2011, Iran pledged to step up military action against the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan, a PKK offshoot that has sought greater autonomy for Kurds in Iran.\n\nRights groups say Kurds, along with other religious and ethnic minorities, face discrimination under the ruling clerical establishment.\n\nThe elite Revolutionary Guards have put down unrest in the Kurdish community for decades, and the country\u2019s judiciary has sentenced many activists to long jail terms or death. Iran\u2019s military has demanded Iraqi authorities hand over separatist Kurdish dissidents stationed there and close their bases.", "description": "Turkish forces are poised to advance into northeast Syria after U.S. troops began vacating the area, in an abrupt policy shift by President Donald Trump widely criticised in Washington as a betrayal of America's Kurdish militia allies.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438810525&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980YH", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
