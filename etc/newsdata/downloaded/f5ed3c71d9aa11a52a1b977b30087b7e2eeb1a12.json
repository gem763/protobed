Five votes will presumably frame the court\u2019s ruling in a trio of crucial employment-discrimination cases that were argued before the justices on Tuesday. All three cases focus on the scope of protections provided by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars workplace discrimination \u201cbecause of \u2026 sex\u201d. Does such a bar prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation? That is the question raised by the first two cases, Bostock v Clayton and Altitude Express v Zarda, while the third, Harris Funeral Homes v EEOC, asks whether Title VII\u2019s bar also covers discrimination against transgender people.\n\nIn its landmark ruling in Obergefell v Hodges (2015), the court recognized a right to gay marriage, but that was a different supreme court. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who long served as the swing vote in a closely divided court, wrote the majority opinion in Obergefell. Kennedy has since been replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, and whatever else one might think of the court\u2019s junior-most justice, he will undeniably move the court firmly to the right. Indeed, this supreme court is the most conservative that the US has seen since the early years of FDR\u2019s presidency, when a hidebound supreme court aggressively struck down New Deal laws designed to alleviate the economic suffering of millions.\n\nThat same hidebound spirit was put richly on display yesterday when Justice Samuel Alito observed during arguments that were the court to extend Title VII protections to gay people, it would be \u201cacting exactly like a legislature\u201d. Such a move, Alito fretted, would \u201cchange the meaning of what Congress understood sex to be\u201d. The argument is less wrong than it is tiresome. Scanning the intent of a Congress is a notoriously unreliable guide to statutory interpretation and one that conservatives generally abjure. Should Congress object to the court\u2019s extending the Civil Right Act\u2019s protections to LGBTQ people, it could always act to curtail the court\u2019s reading.\n\nMore to the point, Alito\u2019s observation is less an explanation than a rhetorical ploy. Every law student solemnly learns that interpreting the law is the province of the courts while making law is the precinct of legislature \u2013 only then to learn that the distinction is utterly unstable and largely incoherent. Conservative jurists call results they like \u2013 for example, that the second amendment protects a personal right to gun ownership \u2013 interpretations. Results they don\u2019t like \u2013 extending basic workplace rights to gay and transgender persons \u2013 are acts of lawmaking, a usurpation of proper judicial function.\n\nGranted: it is not a foregone conclusion that the court\u2019s conservative bloc will refuse to extend the protections of the Civil Rights Act to LGBTQ people. Hopeful was Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s observation that sex, the operative term in Title VII, appeared to be a \u201ccontributing cause\u201d in the firing of transgender petitioners. Less encouraging was his observation that an extension of protections might cause \u201cmassive social upheaval\u201d \u2013 with the understanding that triggering such upheaval should be left to Congress and not the court.\n\nSo safe money counts five votes refusing to extend workplace protections to millions of LGBTQ people. That Gorsuch appears to be the swing vote here is all the more regrettable. Justice Gorsuch, of course, is not to blame for his position on the court. That falls to Mitch McConnell, who cynically stole a seat that rightfully belonged to Merrick Garland. McConnell\u2019s constitutional coup d\u2019\u00e9tat will leave all the decisions of this five-person bloc smacking of illegitimacy. Particularly those with Gorsuch\u2019s stamp.", "description": "The most conservative court in the US in decades will decide whether to extend workplace protections to LGBTQ peopleDemonstrators in favour of LGBT rights rally outside the US supreme court on 8 October 2019, as the court holds oral arguments in three cases dealing with workplace discrimination based", "authors": ["Lawrence Douglas"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7GPLL0Glv.pr2Hm9rCgvkA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/e7b2c8d941cef9a2029421eb96bfdb08", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
