Starbucks isn\u2019t the only shop carrying the drink \u2015 many local coffeehouses do their own versions too. From the end of August until well after Thanksgiving, coffee drinkers are awash in pumpkin spice.\n\nBut if you\u2019re just a bit tired of those flavors and ready to try other coffee and tea drinks, we have some great ideas. Don\u2019t worry \u2015 these drinks will still make you want to wrap yourself in a knit sweater and cuddle up in front of a warm fire.\n\nWe spoke to baristas and coffee roasters around the country about their favorite fall drinks, and these are the beverages you could be ordering instead of a PSL. (For those who don\u2019t live near one of these shops, we\u2019ve included the ingredients, so you can ask your local barista to make the drinks for you.)\n\nMaple Blondie\n\nMain ingredients: espresso, white chocolate, brown sugar, maple spice, milk.\n\nDespite the location of coffee and bagel shop Spill the Beans in the always warm San Diego, lead barista Connor Nerat still knows how to make a mean fall drink. \u201cWhen I think of fall, fresh baked goods and spices come to mind, which is where the inspiration for our seasonal menu items come from,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cThe combination of white chocolate, brown sugar, maple spice, milk and espresso evoke the warm and cozy feeling associated with the change of season from summer to fall.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that the name \u201cmaple blondie\u201d evokes a dessert, as Nerat recommended pairing the drink with a breakfast-time pastry: a warm, flaky croissant.\n\nSpill The Beans A maple blondie from Spill the Beans in San Diego.\n\nHot Butterbeer Latte\n\nMain ingredients: espresso, steamed whole milk, caramel syrup, cinnamon syrup, English toffee syrup.\n\nWe\u2019re not J.K.\u2019ing \u2015 this play on a drink from Harry Potter sounds delicious. Mike Ross, who worked as a barista before starting coffee equipment company Majesty Coffee, noted that butterbeer lattes are perfect if you need to take a break from gourd-based tastes. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of warm fall flavors: caramel, toffee and cinnamon,\u201d he said.\n\nRoss added that it\u2019s typically made with steamed whole milk, but oat milk works just fine. And if the multiple syrups in this drink aren\u2019t enough sugar, he recommended adding salted caramel and whipped cream.\n\nOrange Cardamom Latte\n\nMain ingredients: espresso, steamed milk, orange syrup, ground cardamom.\n\nBlueprint Coffee, a roaster and coffee shop in St. Louis, previously served up this citrusy drink. \u201cThe orange cardamom latte had a pretty significant cult following and is very simple to make,\u201d said barista and coffee lead Alex Werth.\n\nTo prepare it, Blueprint would mix orange cardamom syrup with a double shot of espresso and steamed milk. But since your local shop likely doesn\u2019t have that fancy syrup, Werth said that a half-ounce of orange syrup and a dash of ground cardamom mixed into the espresso should do the trick.\n\nBananas Foster Coffee\n\nMain ingredients: espresso, milk, caramel, vanilla, cinnamon, banana, spiced rum (optional), banana liqueur (optional).\n\nThe dessert-inspired latte served at PJ\u2019s Coffee locations can be ordered hot or iced, with flavors of banana and brown sugar. Seeing as how PJ\u2019s has its roots in booze-friendly New Orleans, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that roastmaster Felton Jones also gives an option for the drink to be spiked with rum and banana liqueur. But if you won\u2019t be near a PJ\u2019s anytime soon, simply order a latte with a pump of caramel, vanilla, cinnamon and banana syrups to achieve a similar flavor.\n\nBomboBar A dirty chai at BomboBar in Chicago.\n\nCaramel Chai Latte Or Dirty Chai\n\nMain ingredients: chai with caramel or espresso and other ingredients.\n\nHere are two fun plays on chai to get you in the mood for fall. Melissa Raef, retail director at Denver\u2019s Novo Coffee, said the roaster\u2019s housemade chai is a year-round hit, but demand spikes in the fall. \u201cWhile not all chais are the same, ours tastes awesome with caramel as a sort of nod to a caramel apple,\u201d Raef said. Simply ask your barista for a pump of caramel syrup and you\u2019re on your way.\n\nNoelle Fagerlund of the Bay Area\u2019s Highwire Coffee speaks highly of dirty chai, which is simply a shot of espresso mixed into a chai latte. \u201cThe chai tea provides a bold, spicy base, typically featuring a mix of black tea, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, ginger and pepper, which offers the warmth we\u2019re looking for in the crisp fall months,\u201d she said.\n\nEvan Shay at Chicago\u2019s coffee and doughnut emporium BomboBar also enjoys the delights of dirty chai. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorites to drink in the fall, not only because it\u2019ll warm you up, but making it dirty with an espresso shot provides a strong caffeine kick to wake you up on a chilly day,\u201d Shay said. If anyone would know how to warm up on a cold day, it would be a Chicagoan.\n\nHoney Coffee\n\nMain ingredients: espresso, milk, local honey.\n\nA pump or two of flavored syrup is all a barista needs to add flavor to coffee. But Austin Ferarri, co-owner of Cincinnati\u2019s Mom \u2019n \u2019Em Coffee, recommends a fall drink that uses a natural sweetener.\n\n\u201cWe take a few grams of Carriage House Farm honey and mix it with a full shot of our espresso blend and milk,\u201d Ferarri said. \u201cThe drink is on the sweeter side, but the honey characteristic really shines through. It adds a soothing thickness to the drink that could be good to combat fall colds.\u201d\n\nNitro In The Clouds\n\nMain ingredients: nitro cold brew coffee, lemon, orange, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger.\n\nCalifornia roaster Klatch Coffee, which has six locations in the state, offers a fun fall play on a nitro coffee. \u201cFall is an interesting season in Southern California,\u201d explained Holly Perry, a barista and the company\u2019s director of retail. \u201cWhile we get the occasional cool and cloudy day, we more often have what feels like endless days of summer sun.\u201d That calls for some citrus sweetness atop the nitro cold brew coffee to remind your tastebuds of the seasons changing.\n\nIf you can\u2019t make it to a Klatch location, head to your local shop and order a nitro cold brew with cream (regular or whipped), vanilla sweetener and a tiny bit of orange or cinnamon syrup.\n\nKlatch Coffee Nitro in the Clouds at Klatch Coffee in California.\n\nSpiced Latte\n\nMain ingredients: espresso, steamed milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, sugar.\n\nIf you love pumpkin spice but aren\u2019t too wild about pumpkin, the spiced latte from NYC\u2019s Birch Coffee should hit the spot. \u201cThe spiced latte is a festive drink that celebrates the transition from the cold brews of summer to colder temperatures,\u201d said Paul Schlader, co-founder and head roaster. \u201cThe ingredients include a mix of familiar fall spices like nutmeg and cinnamon.\u201d", "description": "Butterbeer lattes, maple blondies and honey coffee are here, and they're ready to bust your PSL habit.", "authors": ["On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d82601e2400002e2a7db4c6.jpeg?cache=qdpq9wFMrE&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
