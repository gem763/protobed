The \u201cmooning pumpkin man\u201d was supposed to \u201cmake people laugh and have a little fun,\u201d O\u2019Neill told CBS46, but the HOA apparently doesn\u2019t find it funny at all.\n\nThe HOA reached out to O\u2019Neill, claiming others in the neighborhood had made complaints about it being offensive, especially those with young children, the news outlet reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nO\u2019Neill censored the pumpkin man with a sign that read \u201ccensored by GBHOA\u201d referring to the Grogan\u2019s Bluff Home Owner\u2019s Association. The censoring reportedly did not go over well with the association, either.\n\nThe outlet reports that O\u2019Neill has been putting up the decoration since 2008, and only received complaints about it this year.\n\nMany on social media, however, did not find the mooning pumpkin man offensive and hit out at HOA\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cI would have told HOA to kiss my pumpkins,\u201d one person commented.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cHOAs are the WORST!\u201d another wrote.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing wrong with that, I've seen other post like that on facebook.
