This is evidenced by fresh attacks elsewhere on the rail network as soon as hot spots are successfully controlled.\u201d", "description": "Cape Regional Courts were busy last week, producing no less than 11 convictions for transgressors of the Criminal Matters Amendment Act.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
