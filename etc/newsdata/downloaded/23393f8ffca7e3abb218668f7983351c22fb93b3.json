The rocks were placed there to bar homeless individuals from setting up tents in a two-block alley.\n\nDavid Smith-Tan, who lives in Clinton Park, told local news station KTVU that he and his neighbors \"chipped in a few hundred dollars\" to have the 300-pound boulders delivered. The neighborhood, he said, is frequently occupied by people who use drugs and \"shoot up and stay overnight.\"\n\nThe move incited an intense local controversy, however. On Monday, the San Francisco's public works department started removing the boulders after Clinton Park residents were reportedly harassed in person and online. Residents said they received death threats and were yelled at on the street.\n\nSan Francisco's homelessness crisis continues to escalate\n\nSan Francisco has nearly 10,000 homeless residents, a number that's risen by 30% since 2017. Around 42% of these people struggle with drug or alcohol abuse.\n\n\"It got to the point where everybody was just done,\" an anonymous resident of Clinton Park told local news station KGO, referring to the decision to erect boulders. \"People had knives and guns and people were out fighting, carrying on and waking up people in the neighborhood.\"\n\nAnother anonymous resident of the area told the San Francisco Chronicle that neighbors had called the police hundreds of times before the boulders went up in September.\n\nBut some locals saw the set-up as hostile toward homeless residents. Shortly after the boulders arrived, people tried to clear the pathway by pushing the rocks onto the street, which created a traffic hazard. The city's public works department lifted the boulders back onto the sidewalk via crane.\n\nThe tug-of-war continued for days, with the city returning to the street at least three times in one week. Danielle Baskin, a San Francisco resident who calls herself an \"anti-rock agitator\" on Twitter, tried to have the boulders removed by placing them on Craigslist, but her listings were taken down. She called the move \"barbaric\" on Twitter and said the boulders made \"walking more difficult for everyone.\"\n\nIn the meantime, residents told the city they were being harassed by activists.\n\n\"I met with residents yesterday and they are feeling intimidated and frightened,\" Rafael Mandelman, the city supervisor for Clinton Park, told the Chronicle. \"They didn't like having drug dealing and violence outside their doors before, and they don't like masked vigilantes coming in and protesting and removing rocks.\"\n\nResidents are divided over whether homeless camps should be allowed to stay\n\nGiant rocks to deter tents aren't a new fixture for San Francisco: In 2017, the city placed boulders under a highway to block homeless encampments near Potrero Hill, a residential neighborhood. At the time, city officials said it was a \"humane\" way to discourage people from camping out, the Chronicle reported.\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nIn previous years, various groups in San Francisco have tried to deter homeless residents in other ways. In 2015, the San Francisco Roman Catholic Archdiocese installed sprinklers outside a cathedral that sprayed homeless residents who tried to camp out in their doorways. In the 1990s, the city removed benches from a plaza near City Hall to prevent people from sleeping on them. Other benches throughout the city feature rails and spikes to prevent homeless people from lying down \u2014 a common design tactic in crowded urban areas.\n\nNot all neighbors in Clinton Park supported the boulder plan, though. An anonymous resident told Curbed that the installment \"sets a bad precedent,\" while another, Pablo Soriano, said the decision \"comes from a negative place.\"\n\n\"Needles and human feces have always been an issue, but I don't think this is the best solution,\" Soriano said. \"Maybe instead of putting the time and effort of putting ugly rocks on the sidewalk, my neighbors could donate to foundations and try to get City Hall to fund more shelters, counseling, and methadone clinics.\"\n\nThe debate over how to address San Francisco's homelessness crisis took the national stage in September, when President Trump accused homeless people of ruining the city's highways, streets, and buildings. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein responded by saying homelessness can't be solved by simply sweeping people off the street.\n\nAlthough the boulders in Clinton Park are in the process of being removed, public works department officials have said they're still open to other ways to block homeless encampments.\n\n\"We will support whatever the residents want to do,\" San Francisco public works director Mohammed Nuru told the Chronicle on Monday.", "description": "San Francisco residents placed boulders in an alley to prevent homeless encampments.
