Indeed, in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, decided just a few weeks before the travel ban case, the Supreme Court overturned a decision from a state civil rights commission in a case regarding a baker who declined to prepare a cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony for religious reasons. Although the commission had originally concluded the baker had violated state antidiscrimination law, the Court found that two of the group\u2019s seven members had made biased statements against the baker\u2019s religion\u2014meaning that his case hadn\u2019t been afforded the neutral treatment demanded by the First Amendment\u2019s free exercise clause\u2014and invalidated the commission\u2019s decision. The Court reached that decision even though the commission would quite likely have ruled against the baker regardless of the prejudices of the two members (the other five commissioners also supported the ruling). All five of the justices who voted with the majority in the travel-ban case were part of the 7\u20132 majority in Masterpiece Cakeshop.\n\nRead: How the Supreme Court used \u2018protecting families\u2019 to justify the travel ban\n\nWhy the difference between the two cases? As Chief Justice John Roberts explained in his majority opinion in the travel ban ruling, the answer is that courts defer to the government far more in immigration cases than practically any other area in which constitutional rights are at stake. As he put it, judicial \u201cinquiry into matters of entry and national security is highly constrained.\u201d\n\nThe travel ban is far from the only case in which immigration restrictions have been held to a lower constitutional standard compared with almost any other exercise of government power. In August, the Israeli government was rightly criticized for barring entry to two American members of Congress unless they agreed not to promote the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement during their visit. But few recalled that the U.S. also has a long history of banning foreigners with political views that the government disapproves of. Concerns that European immigrants had dangerous political views were a major motivation behind the highly restrictive 1924 Immigration Act, and were also used to justify barring many Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Even today, the law forbids entry to anyone who has been a \u201cmember of or affiliated with the Communist or any other totalitarian party.\u201d Meanwhile, the government cannot discriminate against U.S. citizens who share those same views, including by denying them government services available to others.\n\nSimilar constitutional double standards pervade many other aspects of immigration policy. Courts have ruled that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment provides for paid counsel in most cases where the state threatens indigent individuals with severe deprivations of liberty. But indigent migrants targeted for detention and deportation are not entitled to free legal representation, and often have to navigate a complex legal system without assistance. This leads to such horrific absurdities as toddlers \u201crepresenting\u201d themselves in deportation proceedings. You don\u2019t have to be a lawyer to recognize that this does not comport with the due process of law required by the Fifth Amendment.", "description": "Immigration restrictions have been held to a far lower constitutional standard compared with almost any other exercise of government power.", "authors": ["Ilya Somin", "Professor Of Law At George Mason University"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19169648537425/facebook.jpg?1570051353"}
