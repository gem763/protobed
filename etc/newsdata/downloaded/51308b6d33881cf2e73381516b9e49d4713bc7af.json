(Jim Havard via Flickr)\n\nClouds were stubborn for a good chunk of the day, but we ended up needing only a few hours of sun to get temperatures to pop. As you may have heard, it was the 60th day at or above 90 degrees this year. That puts 2019 in third place on its own. We\u2019re hoping the top mark of 67 is safe, but in a year like this, I\u2019ll wait to say that for sure! The good news is that it will be more fall-like tomorrow.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Once we get rid of the few sprinkles across the region, skies will tend to break. With time, cooler and drier air will filter in behind the cold front. Lows range from the mid-50s to low 60s. Winds are from the northwest, around 5 to 10 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Friday): It\u2019s a bright and sunny day from start to finish. Humidity returns to the low side as highs rise to near 80 or a bit past there. Winds are from the northwest early but flip back to the south with time.\n\nSee David Streit\u2019s forecast through the beginning of next week.
