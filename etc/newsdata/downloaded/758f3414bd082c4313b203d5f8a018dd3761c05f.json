Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) called the plan \u201ccruel and punitive\u201d in a tweet, before launching into one of her plans for school lunch debt. Her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted that he wants to get rid of all school lunch debt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is cruel and punitive. Every kid needs and deserves a nutritious meal in order to learn at school. My plan will push to cancel student breakfast and lunch debt and increase funding to school meals programs so all students can get a nutritious meal. https://t.co/cAdQkw6qKt \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 21, 2019\n\n\"School lunch debt\" is not a phrase that should exist.@Ilhan and I want to eliminate all of it. https://t.co/icVLKvjhIF \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) October 20, 2019\n\nSen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey native, also joined the Twitter bandwagon and said that he would \u201cfight for universal free lunch and relieve all school lunch debt.\u201d\n\nNo child should go hungry at school\u2014period. As president, I will fight for universal free school lunch and relieve all school lunch debt. https://t.co/ozYTUtGojL \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) October 22, 2019\n\nFiguring out how to get rid of school lunch debt in a noncontroversial way has been difficult for the Cherry Hill Public Schools district.\n\nThe school district cleared $25,000 in school lunch debt in 2017, but it is already back up to $16,500, according to the Courier-Post.\n\nIn August, school board members proposed only offering tuna fish sandwiches to students who owed between $10 and $20 in debt, reported WTHR. Students who owed more than $20 would have been denied meals altogether under that plan.\n\nAD\n\nOpponents of the previous plan have said it was an example of lunch shaming, the Courier-Post reported.\n\nA local businessman offered to get rid of the debt in September, but the school board has been against donations that would clear the debt because it could deter identifying families who do need help covering the cost of lunches, according to the Courier-Post.\n\nAD\n\nSchool districts are allowed to withhold school lunches from students who have not settled their lunch debt after a period of time and notices, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe Cherry Hill Public Schools district had not been enforcing that policy, but that changed when new debt emerged and notices went unanswered, according to WTHR.\n\nAD\n\nSchool lunch debt is common, according to the School Nutrition Association, which released a report this year stating that 75 percent of school districts have student lunch debt. The report said student lunch debt is most common in districts with a low prevalence of free or reduced lunch.\n\nAbout 20 percent of students in the Cherry Hill Public Schools district are considered economically disadvantaged, according to NBC News\u2019s review of New Jersey\u2019s Department of Education information.\n\nCherry Hill Public Schools Superintendent Joseph Meloche told the Courier-Post last week that all children in his district are fed.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A New Jersey school district is trying to get rid of its school lunch debt by withholding school activities from students.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GOlvfH4Uhm6SoP-U2T1MB0yTq80=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5327GNGFAEI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
