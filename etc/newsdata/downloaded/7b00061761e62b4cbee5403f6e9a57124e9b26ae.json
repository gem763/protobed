He is like any teenage boy and embarrasses easily so he just didn't visit the house.\n\n\"He still saw his mum but wouldn't stay overnight because he just couldn't stand the mess.\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Junior also needed to get to school and Katie not driving meant it was more difficult to get around.\"\n\nAt the weekend, Katie cheered on eldest son Harvey, 17, as he performed at Autism's Got Talent.\n\nAnd he was joined by all of her other children, except for Junior.\n\nPrincess, 12, Jett, five, and Bunny, four, were there to support their big brother.\n\nOn an episode of Katie's reality show, My Crazy Life, Junior was once seen telling his mum off for being inappropriate.\n\nWhile Katie and her then-husband Kieran Hayler were clearing out two massive containers full of old stuff, Junior wasn't keen on some of the things he heard.\n\nAs Kieran announced the container was full of \"plastic\" that would \"have to go in the skip\", Katie rubbed her body up and down, saying: \"Plastic but fantastic\", and Kieran squeezed her boobs.\n\nJunior wasn't happy.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHe told his mum: \"Do any parents do that in front of their children?\"\n\nKatie asked: \"Junior, what's weird?\"\n\nAnd he sarcastically responded: \"Oh, yeah, it's just normal for Kieran to go up to you and then just squeeze your boobs and go honk honk honk!\"\n\n\"Well, everyone squeezes my boobs,\" she said in her defence.\n\nPrincess did exactly that to prove the point, but she too has felt embarrassed by her famous mum.\n\nThe youngster once hit out at her mum for \"dressing like a teenager\".\n\nAt the launch of her children's clothing ranges, Princess told Katie: \"You wear clothes, not for your age. You wear clothes for teenagers. You wear a short top, pink slippers.\"\n\nAnd Katie said: \"They don\u2019t even like me getting out the car when I pick them up from school.\n\n\"They get embarrassed of me even pulling up in a pink car, embarrassed when I get out.\n\n\"Junior says to me, 'My friends at school say that I\u2019m not normal' and I say, 'That\u2019s what people say about me. None of us are normal'.\"\n\nKatie also recently gave a tour of her messy home, which has bird poo on the floor and stacks of underwear and clothes lying around everywhere.\n\n(Image: Youtube)\n\n(Image: Youtube)\n\nThere was also graffiti on the walls and no furniture as the property undergoes renovation by a team of builders.\n\nIn a video, Katie admitted sorting through the clutter gave her a \"headache\".\n\nKatie announced in the YouTube clip that she was planning to flog all her old clothes on eBay and that she has nine garages \"full of c**p\".\n\n\"It's exhausting to know where to start, which room which pile,\" Katie said.\n\n\"I don't need these clothes and I'm always saying what can I wear? Where do I start?\n\n\"It just gives me a headache to be honest.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted Katie and Peter's representatives for comment.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
