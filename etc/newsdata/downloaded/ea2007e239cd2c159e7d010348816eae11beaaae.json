(Picture: Backgrid)\n\nAs the weather continues to get cooler across the UK, Christine McGuiness is not bothered by it in the slightest, as she made another bold choice fashion statement while out in Cheshire.\n\nThe Real Housewives star looked the part as she headed out to the KP Aesthetics treatment centre in the village of Hale, rocking a black jumper and glittery miniskirt embroidered with white buttons, which she paired with black boots and black knee-high socks, while carrying a white handbag.\n\nAnd she clearly was not feeling the cold weather at all, as she did not wear a coat and chose to sport a huge pair of sunglasses instead.\n\nShe does realise it\u2019s October, doesn\u2019t she?\n\nIn fact, Christine previously ventured out earlier in the week wearing just a vest with a plaid mini-skirt, again rounding off her look with sunglasses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs she in a parallel world to the rest of us where Cheshire experiences warmer weather in October? Is she immune to winter? We may never know \u2013 but we have to give her props for braving the weather in such a daring choice of clothing for this time of year.\n\nThe star is known for taking a risk with fashion, as she also recently donned a sparkly blue see-through dress at Manchester Fashion Festival earlier in the month.\n\nAnd in August, she transformed herself into a Barbie doll for a Real Housewives Of Cheshire fancy dress party, wearing a pink PVC dress with a harness across the chest.\n\nChristine wore black jumper paired with a sparkly skirt (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nShe was not afraid to sport a pair of sunglasses either (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nThe star was visiting the KP Aesthetics centre in the Cheshire village of Hale (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nChristine, who is married to TV personality Paddy McGuiness, recently admitted that she fears for her husband\u2019s life when he is busy presenting Top Gear.\n\n\u2018I do worry about him,\u2019 she told The Mirror. \u2018When he got it [the job] my first thought was, \u201cOh my god, I really hope he\u2019s sensible\u201d, because obviously I want him to be careful. I tell him not to go too fast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s pretty good at driving. We\u2019ve usually got the kids with us. He\u2019s very sensible, but when he\u2019s on the show he goes back to being a boy in a car.\u2019\n\nChristine and Paddy have been married since 2011, and they have three children together: six-year-old twins Penelope and Leo and three-year-old Felicity.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
