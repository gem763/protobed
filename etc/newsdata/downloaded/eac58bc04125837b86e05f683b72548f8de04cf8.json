(Tom Brenner for The Washington Post)\n\nSince Democrats began an impeachment inquiry, President Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee chairman, by accusing him of treason and demanding that he be removed from office.\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump repeated those claims on Twitter \u2014 and this time, suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is also guilty of \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason,\u201d while insisting that both Democratic leaders should be impeached.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi knew all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 & lawyer,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n....This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u201cColluded\u201d with them, must all be immediately Impeached! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nThe tweets came on a typical Sunday evening for the president, who sent a flurry of missives alternately bashing and praising cable news interviews about the deepening political crisis that\u2019s threatening his presidency and paralyzing many inside the Republican Party, as The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Philip Rucker reported.\n\n[\u2018Out on a limb\u2019: Inside the Republican reckoning over Trump\u2019s possible impeachment]\n\nAmid the inquiry into Trump\u2019s request that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, the president has increasingly accused his perceived enemies \u2014 from Democratic leaders to the anonymous whistleblower who sparked the probe \u2014 of treason.\n\nSchiff, who is leading the Democratic inquiry, has come in for particularly withering criticism. Trump has slammed Schiff for falsely stating that his committee hadn\u2019t spoken to the whistleblower and for paraphrasing the president\u2019s conversation with Zelensky during a hearing.\n\nOn Sunday, the president aimed his ire at Pelosi as well, whom he has complained is short-circuiting the impeachment process by starting an inquiry without a full House vote.\n\n[Trump uses vulgarity, calls for Romney\u2019s impeachment after senator criticizes president\u2019s China, Ukraine appeals]\n\n\u201cI guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u2018Colluded\u2019 with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nHouse and Senate members cannot be impeached; rather, both bodies can expel members with a two-thirds vote \u2014 a process that doesn\u2019t involve the president. That didn\u2019t stop Trump from also demanding on Saturday that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) be impeached.\n\nLast week, Pelosi said that Trump is \u201cscared\u201d of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cCongress must not back down from our duty to defend the Constitution as @realDonaldTrump ignores the Founders\u2019 warnings about foreign interference at every turn. #TruthExposed,\u201d she tweeted on Friday.\n\nPelosi hasn\u2019t committed to holding a full House vote on the impeachment inquiry. On Friday, Trump conceded that Democrats likely have enough votes to impeach him.", "description": "The tweets came on a typical Sunday evening for the president, who sent a flurry of tweets alternately bashing and praising cable news interviews about the deepening political crisis that\u2019s threatening his presidency.", "authors": ["Tim Elfrink", "Editor Of The Morning Mix", "October At Am", "Tim Elfrink Joined The Washington Post In He'S The Editor Of Morning Mix."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CMtVvaj9ot0BWL8i3zLKB4HI7R0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GXHMRSHG64I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
