Don't let travel document problems ground your next vacation", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The United Arab Emirates is now home to the world\u2019s most powerful passport, according to the Passport Index. Time\n\nIf you think your international travel documents for your next trip abroad are ship-shape, you might want to talk to Chrysoula Chrysogelou.\n\nChrysogelou, a hotel manager from Greece, was flying from Athens to Chicago recently when a Lufthansa agent told her \u2013 wrongly, as it turned out \u2013 that her permit from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s visa waiver program (ESTA) was invalid.\n\nBecause it was going to expire before she returned home, she had to pay $522 for an earlier flight. She hoped Lufthansa might refund the money once it realized its error, but it refused.\n\nTravel document requirements can be complicated, but as Chrysogelou found out the hard way, they've become even trickier lately.\n\nPassengers say that on top of having to obtain the proper visas for their destinations, they also now must meet an airline's requirements, which can be even stricter. And even when airline staffers know the rules, those rules can be unevenly enforced.\n\nSo, unfortunately, it's on you to make sure you dot every \"i\" and cross every \"t\" before you board your plane to Europe this summer.\n\nThese days, you may have to jump through extra hoops at your airline's check-in desk before you even make it to passport control. (Photo: PHILIPPE HUGUEN, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nVisa waivers may not be enough\n\nIf you're traveling internationally, you might need a visa, which is an endorsement on your passport indicating that you may enter a country. Americans don't need visas to enter 116 countries \u2013 including 26 in Europe \u2013 for short-term tourism, business or layovers on the way to a non-treaty country. However, some popular destinations such as China and Brazil do require U.S. citizens to obtain visas.\n\nIn Chrysogelou's case, she qualified for a visa waiver for her trip to the United States. And while the waiver was valid when she began her trip, the German-based Lufthansa imposes an additional requirement: Passengers must have valid documents for the \"entire duration\" of their stay. (After I asked Lufthansa about her case, it rescheduled her flights to her original dates.)\n\nIn other words, you need to know how long you can remain in your destination country without a visa. If your trip exceeds that period \u2013 typically 90 days for U.S. passport holders visiting European countries on business or leisure trips \u2013 you need to obtain a visa through the embassy of the country where you will spend the bulk of your visit.\n\nTo be on the safe side, the State Department also recommends that you make sure your passport is valid for six months past the date of your trip.\n\nPaperwork confusion is common among airline staffers\n\nChrysogelou isn't the only traveler with a tale of woe involving travel documentation and misinformed airline agents.\n\nAtif Shabbirdin, a building manager from Boxhill, England, says his wife, who resides in Spain, ran into trouble when she tried to fly EasyJet from Malaga, Spain, to London.\n\n\"An EasyJet representative wrongfully stated that because she had a Moroccan passport, she needed a visa to join me in the U.K.,\" he says. \"Prior to her travel, we had checked with the Border Control telephone helpline and were told there were no visa requirements.\"\n\nShabbirdin's wife showed the agent her European Union-issued Spanish residence card, but it didn't help.\n\n\"EasyJet would not budge until my advocacy team showed it chapter and verse of the entry requirements,\" he recalls. \"It then apologized and refunded the unused airline ticket. The airline also covered her expenses and the ticket she had to purchase.\"\n\nThere's also the case of Anita Tolani, an attorney from Bethesda, Maryland, whose Bahamas vacation was imperiled when American Airlines wouldn't let a member of her family board their flight from Washington, D.C., to Nassau.\n\n\u201cThe gate agent would not allow my daughter to travel because her passport expired in February,\u201d she says. \u201cThe agent insisted that the passport had to be valid for six months after the Dec. 20 date of return.\u201d (As noted above, that is a recommendation from the State Department, not a hard-and-fast requirement, as the airline employee insisted.)\n\nThe State Department information page regarding travel to the Bahamas is clear: U.S. passports, it says, \u201cmust be valid at time of entry.\u201d American has a separate policy requiring all passports to be valid for at least six months past the date of travel.\n\nI reached out to American about Tolani's case, and it issued two ticket vouchers, plus two more $200 vouchers for her \u201ctrouble.\u201d\n\nKnow the rules \u2013 all of them\n\nExperienced travelers know that they need to know the rules before they travel. Get them from a reliable source \u2013 namely, a government agency. Then bookmark the relevant document on your smartphone and, to be extra safe, bring a printout, too.\n\n\"The only sure way to know if you have the right visa is to visit the official government website for the destination country and check the requirements for your passport,\" says Eric Wychopen, a frequent traveler and blogger based in Maastricht, Netherlands. \"Going by the experience of other travelers or even relying on third-party visa providers is not a guarantee that your entry documentation is in order.\"\n\nBottom line: Even if you think you have the right documents for your summer trip, you may also bump up against airline policies that might ground you. Check with your airline, cruise line or travel agent if you have any doubts.\n\nWhere to find reliable information about travel documents\n\nTo ensure you can make your international trip smoothly, you'll want to consult these sources. Make printouts of the appropriate pages and take them with you.\n\nCheck official sources\n\nThe State Department lists the most current passport and visa requirements for U.S. citizens.\n\nYou may also want to check with the embassy of the country you're visiting. For example, if you're headed to France, you can find out about its travel document requirements through its embassy in Washington.\n\nConsult Timatic\n\nThe most reliable non-government source of travel documents information is Timatic, which you can access through the International Air Transport Association's Travel Centre.\n\nTom Harriman, an attorney based in Washington, D.C., says Timatic information carries a lot of weight with airlines when there's a question about your travel documents. \"You hand the gate agent the Timatic printout,\" he says. \"Game, set, match!\"\n\nReview your airline's website\n\nRemember, the airline's requirements can differ from the official government requirements.\n\nFor example, as Tolani found out, if you want to board an international flight on American Airlines, your passport must be valid \"for at least six months\" after the date you enter a foreign country \u2013 even if the State Department's information page says otherwise.\n\nFor help getting started, do a Google search for \"international travel documents\" or \"required travel documents\" and the name of your airline.\n\nChristopher Elliott is a consumer advocate.
