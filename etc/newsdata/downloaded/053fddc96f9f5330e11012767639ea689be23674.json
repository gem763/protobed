Security forces had launched another assault on Anchar, the only major pocket of resistance in Kashmir.\n\n\u201cOthers have only heard the word doomsday, we have lived a doomsday,\u201d said Fazi, a grandmother who lives in Anchar, a suburb of Kashmir\u2019s main city, Srinagar, situated on the banks of a lake of the same name.\n\nTeargas and pellets were fired into a park near to the shrine where crowds were attending prayers, she said. Residents rushed to the frontline on Anchar\u2019s outskirts, barely 500 metres away, to push back against security forces. She said the assault, on 30 August, lasted five hours.\n\n\u201cIt was like rain. There were pellets everywhere, smoke everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no weapons. We have only God\u2019s name and God will do justice with us.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is now more than five weeks since the Indian government revoked the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir and placed the state under strict lockdown. Many Kashmiris fear that their way of life in India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state is at risk. A heavy troop presence, a communication blackout and widespread detentions have mostly prevented large protests.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People run during clashes in Anchar last month.

Residents, mostly creative artisans who weave pashmina shawls, have used JCBs to dig trenches around the neighbourhood. Tin sheets, waste containers, mesh wires and logs have been placed as barricades. At night, teams keep watch to spot if security forces are approaching.\n\nIt is thought to be the first time in recent decades that civilians in Kashmir have prevented Indian paramilitaries and local police from entering an area. Entire families join in with the efforts. \u201cWhen we throw a stone, our women are always there to give us a stone,\u201d said one man.\n\n\u201cWe do it for three reasons,\u201d said Mohammad Subhan, in his early 50s, who was among those who took part in the night watch. \u201cOne, so the youth are not detained. Two, so our homes are not ransacked. Three, so the honour of our daughters and women is not violated.\u201d\n\nSubhan\u2019s wife and four daughters were at the shrine of Jenab Sahab when the assault began. Like many women, Saima, 22, the eldest daughter, ran to help those defending Anchar.\n\n\u201cIt is the women who do all the logistics work: they gather the stones, they bring us the water, they bring us salt,\u201d said one man. \u201cIt would be impossible to fight without their support.\u201d Saltwater is used to counter the effect of teargas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Women shout slogans during a protest in Anchar.

A metal pellet pierced Maysara\u2019s eye. She was smuggled to her aunt\u2019s home elsewhere in Srinagar and underwent treatment in hospital.\n\nQurat was wounded in the head. Saima was hit on the neck and arms. \u201cFirst I felt like hot sand was thrown on me and then I felt my neck is burning,\u201d said Saima.\n\nShe was treated at the shrine late in the evening by doctors who had been smuggled into the neighbourhood. They administered painkillers and injections to prevent infections.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how [Maysara] is, whether she is still admitted or she has been discharged,\u201d said Subhan. The communications blackout means people have no idea if their relatives are safe.\n\nFazi\u2019s 22-year-old grandson, Bilal, was blinded in his right eye by a pellet. \u201cThe bleeding was not stopping, so we sent him to the hospital but doctors said they cannot save his eye,\u201d said Bilal\u2019s father, Mohammad Ramzan. \u201cThe doctors recommended that we should take him to a specialised eye hospital outside Kashmir.\u201d\n\nHe was smuggled out of the city. Ramzan has no idea where his son is or if he is safe.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Welcome Taliban\u2019 graffiti in Anchar.

Some landlines have since been restored but these remain unreliable. Few in Kashmir know about the scale of events in Anchar, and few in Anchar dare to leave their neighbourhood.\n\nElsewhere in Srinagar, markets remain shut \u2013 an act of defiance on the part of workers, who refuse to comply with the Delhi government\u2019s claim that everything in the region is returning to normal. Public transport also remains shut.\n\nThe revocation of Kashmir\u2019s special status stripped the region of its constitution and flag. Rules that prevented outsiders from buying land in the territory also disappeared.\n\nIn Anchar, posters of fighters are pasted across shuttered shops. \u201cDon\u2019t call them militants,\u201d a young man said. \u201cThey are mujahideen, they fight for our cause.\u201d Many believe these fighters are their only source of hope in the wake of Delhi\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Indian government has said its actions will rid the state of terrorism and bring development. It maintains that the situation remains calm.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey say things are normal. What normalcy is this?\u201d said Subhan. \u201cThey have shut our main mosques. Jamia Masjid is locked. If this is just the beginning, what will they do afterwards?\u201d\n\nHe said he would continue to take part in the night watch. \u201cAnchar is fighting for all of Kashmir,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A student\u2019s pellet wounds. Photograph: Supplied/The Guardian\n\nAt night-time, groups of youths are stationed along routes into the city. \u201cWhen the alarm is raised, everyone comes to defend this place,\u201d a college student said at his home where he was recovering from pellet injuries.\n\n\n\nMore than 100 pellets were lodged in his body, neck and head, he said. \u201cIt was very painful. When I was hit it was like a hundred needles had pricked me.\u201d\n\nKhatija, his mother, said her heart trembled every night as she feared another raid. \u201cGod should now have mercy on us,\u201d she said.\n\nKhatija\u2019s elder son, a 24-year-old shawl weaver who regularly attends the night guard, said people came out of their houses \u201clike bees\u201d when the alarm of an incoming raid was raised. \u201cWe are like one family here, like a folded hand,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described Anchar\u2019s resistance as a \u201cfight for existence\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are fighting for haqq [truth], we are fighting for azadi [freedom].\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThey want to erase us, they want to erase our history. We will not let that happen.\u201d", "description": "Civilians in the Srinagar suburb of Anchar say they are engaged in a fight for existence", "authors": ["Azhar Farooq In Srinagar"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53070676a7ab0aadb2314588827c77e76932c572/170_12_4598_2760/master/4598.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34345547e1891d849c8294f5404a32a5", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
