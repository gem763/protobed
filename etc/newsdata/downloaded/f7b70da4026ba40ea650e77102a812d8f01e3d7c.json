Tomorrow, I\u2019ll join tribal leaders, elected officials, and other Minnesotans calling to #ChangeTheMascot. pic.twitter.com/zlKhGrh4m3 \u2014 Rep. Betty McCollum (@BettyMcCollum04) October 23, 2019\n\nUse of Native American terminology and imagery has remained controversial in the sports world. While Redskins owner Daniel Snyder has repeatedly said he will not change his team\u2019s name, many teams at the college, high school and other levels have done so in recent years.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians phased out Chief Wahoo, a logo featuring a caricature of a grinning Native American, after the 2018 season. Before a playoff game earlier this month, the Atlanta Braves discontinued handing fans foam tomahawks after a player for a rival team, a member of the Cherokee Nation, complained that he found it \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring the 2014 protest outside of Minneapolis\u2019s TCF Bank Stadium, where the Vikings played that season, McCollum told demonstrators, \u201cHere in Minnesota, we have 11 proud tribal nations, but only 150 years ago, their ancestors, men and women, elders and children, were hunted and murdered for profit. This was a government-funded policy of genocide. The pain of this brutal and shameful history is still with us.\u201d\n\nEstimates of attendees at that protest ranged from 3,500 to 5,000. Melanie Benjamin, chief executive of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, recently said in a statement that \u201cnothing has changed \u2014 the Washington NFL team still unapologetically uses the worst Native American racial epithet.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, 50 United States senators signed letters to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, urging his league to \u201cformally support and push for a name change for the Washington football team.\u201d Redskins President Bruce Allen responded by sending a letter to then-Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid in which he said, \u201cOur use of \u2018Redskins\u2019 as the name of our football team for more than 81 years has always been respectful of and shown reverence toward the proud legacy and traditions of Native Americans.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a 2013 letter to fans, Snyder asserted, \u201cI\u2019ve listened carefully to the commentary and perspectives on all sides, and I respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name. But I hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means, not only for all of us in the extended Washington Redskins family, but among Native Americans too.\u201d\n\nA few months before, Snyder had taken a more strident approach, telling USA Today, \u201cWe\u2019ll never change the name. It\u2019s that simple. NEVER \u2014 you can use caps.\u201d\n\nGonna be a scene Thursday evening outside US Bank Stadium where thousands are expected to protest the Redskins name before a national TV kickoff on @FOX9. Native American groups & supporters have held similar demonstrations in #Mpls when Washington has come to town over the years pic.twitter.com/A6haBk7V9k \u2014 Paul Blume (@PaulBlume_FOX9) October 23, 2019\n\nLast year, Goodell indicated that he would continue to not make an overt push for Snyder to change the name, saying that the owner \u201chas really worked in the Native American community to understand better their perspective.\u201d Goodell also pointed to a 2016 Washington Post poll in which nine of 10 respondents who self-identified as Native American said they were not offended by the Redskins\u2019 name.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSnyder celebrated that poll at the time, saying in a statement, \u201cWe are gratified by this overwhelming support from the Native American community, and the team will proudly carry the Redskins name.\u201d\n\nSome Native American activists, however, took issue with the poll\u2019s findings, including Suzan Shown Harjo, who has worked for decades to encourage sports teams to adopt different mascots.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept self-identification. People say they\u2019re native, and they are not native, for all sorts of reasons,\u201d she said in 2016. \u201cThose of us who are leaders in Indian Country \u2026 know who we are representing. We also know if we are representing a minority view. And this is not the case here.\"\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the 21st century, we should rightly condemn the use of racial slurs that disparage African Americans, Latinos, Asians, anyone,\u201d McCollum said Wednesday, stating that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that \u201cRedskin\u201d is \u201ca slur.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are millions of Native Americans in this country whose ancestors endured forced removal from their lands, suppression of their culture and state-sponsored campaigns of ethnic cleansing,\u201d she added. \u201cThe NFL\u2019s racist mascot mocks this painful history.\u201d\n\nIn addition to McCollum, speakers at the protest are expected to include Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, as well as other state and local politicians and activist Winona LaDuke.\n\nAD\n\nAnother speaker will be D.C. Council Member David Grosso (I-At Large), according to the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media, which is among the organizations hosting the event. In 2013, a Grosso-introduced resolution that was approved by the council called on the Redskins to change their \u201cracist and derogatory\u201d name to one \u201cthat is not offensive to Native Americans or any other ethnic group.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor decades, the Washington NFL team has profited off their name and mascot,\u201d David Glass, the president of NCARSM, said in a recent statement, \u201cwith no regard for its painful connection to the displacement, violence and trauma experienced by indigenous peoples for generations.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "\"We will be calling on the NFL to end its racist exploitation of Native Americans and do one thing: change the mascot,\" Rep.
