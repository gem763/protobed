It appears random, is certainly brutal and of course extremely frightening for anyone who witnessed it.\n\n\"We have arrested the man, a male in his 40s, on suspicion of terrorism because of the nature and circumstances of this attack.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe added that investigators did not believe anyone else to be involved in the attack.\n\nGreater Manchester Police initially stated five people had been injured, but later amended the figure to four.\n\nA 19-year-old woman and another woman for whom no age was given were both taken to hospital with stab injuries and their condition was described as stable by the force.\n\nA man in his 50s was also hospitalised with stab wounds, while a woman in her 40s was treated by paramedics at the scene but was not stabbed.", "description": "A knifeman who stabbed three people at the shopping centre has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism", "authors": ["Danya Bazaraa", "Image", "Pa", "John Greenhalgh Via Reuters", "Jdworsley Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561853.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Stabbing-at-Manchester-Arndale-Centre.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
