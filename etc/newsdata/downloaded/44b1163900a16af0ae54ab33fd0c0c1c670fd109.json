There were about five or six homes burning and firefighters were trying to save the houses near to those that were on fire. The heat from the fire was so intense that the firefighter could only stand near the burning building for 10-15 seconds before having to move away\" - Justin Sullivan Getty 2/8 \"This was only one of several large-scale forest fires in Brandenburg state in Germany last year, following droughts which left the forests in the region extremely dry. The year set a new record for fires that burned over 400 hectares. As a photojournalist covering the region for over 15 years, I now have to assume either drought or floods will very likely be a part of the news we will be covering every summer\" - Sean Gallup Getty 3/8 \"This photograph was taken at a sunflower field at Goersdorf near Golssen in Germany. The farmers in the region are really despairing. In the years before many faced floods, in 2018 it was scorching heat. Many grow crops that are meant to feed their cows, so when the crops fail they need to buy feed. With the price of milk so low many are fearing for their economic survival if weather cycles like this continue\" - Sean Gallup Getty 4/8 \"On the third day of the Camp Fire the flames had moved away from the town and were burning in the nearby hills. I captured this photo in Big Bend, as the story was shifting away from the fire itself and focusing on trying to locate missing persons and recover remains of those who had perished\" - Justin Sullivan Getty 5/8 \"You can see the Belchatow power plant and the rising steam and smoke from over 20km away. I went there the day before the start of the United Nations\u2019 climate conference in Katowice, which took place in a region where coal has a long history and coal mining is woven into local tradition. Poland has made some strides with renewables, such as with wind turbines that now dot portions of the western Polish countryside. However, given how heavily Poland still relies on coal, it is unlikely that Belchatow will close anytime soon.

But there is a change to a more northerly airflow and that could bring other changes with it - quite noticeably we could start to see wintery showers in some of the uplands of northern Britain - probably parts of Dumfries and Galloway, and the peak district perhaps\u201d.\n\nHe added that there would be \u201cjust a touch of wintriness\u201d and they were \"\"not necessarily suggesting that there's going to be heavy snowfall but it could be the first snow that people see at least falling, even if it doesn't settle for too long\u201d.", "description": "Parts of the UK are facing the possibility of up to a month's rainfall in 24 hours, forecasters have warned\u00a0as new \"danger to life\" warnings were issued.\u00a0 Gale force winds will also batter some regions and thre first snow of the year might hit higher ground,\u00a0the\u00a0Met Office\u00a0said,\u00a0 Heavy rain is set to stretch across the west of the country \u2013 with the drenching continuing in", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/09/rain-m4-uk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
