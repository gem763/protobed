For me, now he has retired, it makes the job a lot easier.\n\n\u201cYou knew if Bolt was competing, the stadium would always be full.\n\n\u201cSometimes in championships they would struggle to fill it out, if Bolt is running, if you are in that final, then you know it will be full.\n\n\u201cThat was a nice feeling. In terms of competing against him, I felt honoured and privileged to have done that.\n\n\u201cFor me, as an athlete, he was another person I would try to beat.\u201d\n\nBut Gemili, who is also running in the 200m, will ignore any controversy surrounding 100m favourite Christian Coleman.\n\nThe American, the fastest man in the world this year, can run after initially being charged in August with missing three drugs tests, which he denied.\n\nHe was facing a one-year ban but USADA withdrew the charge after guidance from the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nGemili said: \u201cI try not to focus on it. It doesn\u2019t affect what I do at all. He has run super-fast this year. His situation is his situation.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say maybe, humility goes a long way in track-and-field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clean slate. When you are running, it doesn\u2019t matter how fast you run, and he is just another competitor for me.\n\n\u201cHe has been allowed to compete, which as an athlete, we have no real say in anything. We just turn up.\u201d\n\nTeam-mate and European champion Hughes is fifth favourite for the title behind Coleman, defending champion Justin Gatlin, Andre De Grasse and Yohan Blake.\n\nHughes, who is also out to defend the 4x100m relay title with Gemili, said: \u201cThey\u2019re beatable. They\u2019ve had days where they\u2019ve been beaten so why not?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking to go there and give it my very best. I\u2019m looking to represent the country, myself and my brand.\n\n\u201cThat is to go out there and give it my best performance \u2013 not let those guys get into my head \u2013 and focus on myself and my execution.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Lake is in the high jump qualification, Holly Bradshaw competes in the pole vault and Tish Jones and Charlotte Purdue run the women\u2019s marathon at midnight local time with temperatures around 33 degrees.\n\nPA", "description": "Great Britain\u2019s Adam Gemili insists the race for the 100m world title is wide open without Usain Bolt.
