The prevailing pullback has thus far been underpinned by first support matching the breakout point (2,989).\n\nDelving deeper, the top of the gap (2,960) is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 2,950.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13% remains the strongest big three U.S. benchmark.\n\nTactically, an inflection point matches the July gap (27,088) \u2014 an area also detailed on the daily chart \u2014 and is followed by the former range top (26,900).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.40% is also acting well technically.\n\nHere again, the prevailing pullback from the September peak has been underpinned by the breakout point (8,134).\n\nSeparately, recall that last week\u2019s close (8,176) matched the April peak (8,176), a headline inflection point also illustrated below.\n\nWidening the view to six months adds perspective.\n\nOn this wider view, the Nasdaq is digesting the early-September breakout.\n\nTactically, the 50-day moving average, currently 8,060, closely matches the July gap (8,059) and the top of the September gap (8,061). A posture atop this area signals a bullish intermediate-term bias.\n\nLooking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has snapped an eight-session winning streak, its longest stretch in over one year.\n\nThe September peak registered about 92 points under its all-time high.\n\nTactically, an inflection point matches the July gap (27,088) and is followed by support (26,900) better illustrated on the hourly chart.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 has thus far topped about seven points under its record peak (3,028).\n\nBroadly speaking, the 50-day moving average, currently 2,950.6, is closely followed by the former range top (2,943). A posture atop this area signals a bullish intermediate-term bias.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nCollectively, the major U.S. benchmarks\u2019 bigger-picture backdrop remains bullish.\n\nThough each index has topped slightly under record territory, the prevailing pullback from the September peak has been orderly \u2014 at least so far.\n\nMoving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has knifed atop the 50-day moving average, rising to next resistance (158.00).\n\nThe initial breakout was fueled by a volume spike, while recent selling pressure near resistance has been driven by decreased volume. Constructive price action.\n\nThe small-cap benchmark has not closed atop the 158 mark since early May.\n\nSimilarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400\u2019s backdrop strengthened with last week\u2019s spike atop the 50-day moving average.\n\nTactically, the MDY\u2019s 11-month range top spans from about 362.00 to 362.90, and the pending retest will likely add color. An eventual breakout would resolve a double bottom defined by the May and August lows.\n\nLooking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 remains incrementally stronger than the small- and mid-caps.\n\nThe SPY briefly tagged a fractional record high (302.46) last week, though it has yet to surpass its record close (302.01), established July 26.\n\nPlacing a finer point on the S&P 500, its September price action remains bullish.\n\nTo start, the prevailing pullback from the September peak has been flat, underpinned by first support (2,989).\n\nAlso recall that last week\u2019s low (2,957) closely matched the top of the gap (2,960) punctuating a successful test of what was then first support.\n\nDelving deeper, a more important floor matches the breakout point (2,943). The S&P\u2019s intermediate-term bias remains bullish barring a violation.\n\nConversely, the September peak (3,020.74) has registered slightly under the S&P\u2019s record close (3,025.86) and absolute record peak (3,027.98).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the prevailing pullback from the September peak has thus far registered as flat, fueled by decreased volume, and has been underpinned by well-defined support.\n\nBeyond technical levels, the September backdrop has been punctuated by healthy U.S. sector rotation, as well as tandem global-market breakouts, most recently detailed last week. Collectively, the S&P 500\u2019s intermediate- to longer-term technical bias remains bullish.\n\nAlso see: Charting a bullish technical tilt, S&P 500 sustains September breakout.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Watch List\n\nThe charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names \u2014 sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library.\n\nDrilling down further, the United States Oil Fund USO, -4.21% \u2014 profiled last week \u2014 has confirmed a September trend shift. The fund tracks the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light, sweet crude oil.\n\nAs illustrated, the shares gapped sharply higher in Monday\u2019s action, notching a 12.2% single-day gain after a weekend attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oil facilities erased about one half of the country\u2019s daily production. (Also about 5% of global daily production.)\n\nThe shares are lower early Tuesday, pressured amid reports that production may be restored within just two to three weeks.\n\nNonetheless, the strong-volume spike places the shares at nearly four-month highs, and resolves a bullish island reversal defined by the May and September gaps. Gap support spans from 12.37 to 12.45.\n\nDelving deeper, trendline support closely matches the major moving averages \u2014 the 11.70 area \u2014 and a late-year rally attempt is intact barring a violation.\n\nMoving to U.S. sectors, the SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ETF \u2014 profiled Friday \u2014 has also taken flight.\n\nIn the process, the group has gapped atop its breakdown point (24.65), confirming the early-September trend shift. The prevailing upturn originates from trendline support closely tracking the 50-day moving average.\n\nLooking elsewhere, the 10-year Treasury note yield TNX, -1.58% has turned higher, rising amid a September risk-on trade.\n\nIn the process, the yield has registered consecutive closes atop the 50-day moving average, a level that formerly defined the downtrend. The breakout raises the flag to a potential intermediate-term trend shift to the extent the upturn is sustained.\n\nOn further strength, major overhead matches the 2017 low (2.03) and the July close (2.02) established immediately before the August downdraft.\n\nConversely, gap support (1.79) matches the 50-day moving average, also currently 1.79. The pending retest from above will likely add color.\n\nMoving to specific names, Hess Corp. HES, -3.54% is a large-cap oil and gas name coming to life. (Yield = 1.4%.)\n\nTechnically, the shares have gapped atop trendline resistance, knifing to 11-month highs.\n\nThough near-term extended, the strong-volume spike is longer-term bullish and the shares are attractive on a pullback. Tactically, the top of the gap (66.28) is followed by the deeper breakout point (64.80).\n\nWestlake Chemical Corp. WLK, -4.92% is a large-cap specialty chemicals producer. (Yield = 1.5%.)\n\nAs illustrated, the shares have extended a trendline breakout, rising to close atop the 200-day moving average for the first time since August 2018. The upturn signals a potential primary trend shift.\n\nTactically, trendline support closely matches the 50-day moving average, currently 63.90, and the recovery attempt is intact barring a violation.\n\nInitially profiled June 26, SunPower Corp. SPWR, +12.06% has returned 27.4% and remains well positioned.\n\nThe shares started August with a breakout, gapping to three-year highs after the company\u2019s second-quarter results.\n\nThe ensuing pullback has filled the gap, also placing the shares at an attractive entry near the breakout point (12.50) and 24% under the August peak.\n\nStill well positioned\n\nThe table below includes names recently profiled in The Technical Indicator that remain well positioned.
