Her answer has enraged the Chinese public.\n\nThe French fashion house immediately said the employee's comment was 'erroneous' and represented her own opinion.\n\nFrench luxury brand Dior has condemned its employees for giving 'erroneous' expression after they were asked by a university student why a map of China they showed didn't include Taiwan\n\nOne of the most popular high-end fashion labels in the country, Dior is represented by a number of Chinese celebrities, including Eurasia actress known as Angelababy (pictured). She is seen attending the Christian Dior Womenswear Spring/Summer 2020 show in Paris\n\nThe incident occurred two months after Dior was caught listing Taiwan as a city in Japan on its website.\n\n'Dior is China's friend', the company said in a statement in Chinese, adding it 'strictly safeguards the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity'.\n\n'[We] cherish the feelings of the Chinese people', added the firm which is part of French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.\n\nThe statement was published on Chinese social media platforms, including Weibo and WeChat, but did not appear on Dior's social media accounts in the West.\n\nDior is the latest company to bow to China over a perceived insult to national sovereignty.\n\nVersace, Valentino, Coach, Calvin Klein and Givenchy \u2013 among others \u2013 had already said sorry to Beijing for listing Hong Kong and Taiwan as separate countries.\n\n'Dior always respects and maintains the principle of One China,' the company said in a statement. Dior's China spokesperson Angelababy is seen posing for a picture with Karlie Kloss (left) as she attends the Dior Champs-Elysees Flagship Inauguration on September 25\n\nThe scandal broke after a student posted an anonymous video to the Chinese social media app Weibo, purporting to show a presentation Wednesday at Zhejiang Gongshang University, in eastern China.\n\nIn the video, a presenter from Dior displays a map without the island of Taiwan marked, which quickly drew criticism online and prompted Dior to deny that it represented the brand's position.\n\nA female student can be heard asking the presenter: 'I would like to ask why the map does not have China's Taiwan?'\n\nMembers of the audience applaud her question by clapping.\n\n'I think\u2026 it's perhaps because Taiwan is too small and the picture is too small, therefore it's not shown. In fact, it is on the map,' says the female Dior employee.\n\nThe student continues to challenge the presenter by questioning why the map shows Hainan Island, which covers less land mass than Taiwan.\n\nA student posted an anonymous video to the Chinese social media app Weibo, purporting to show a presentation featuring the controversial map at Zhejiang Gongshang University\n\nIn the video, a female student asks a female presenter why the map doesn't show Taiwan\n\n'Thank you for raising the question. How do we usually call Hong Kong and Taiwan? By putting China in front of them,' the presenter tries to salvage the situation.\n\n'We say Chinese mainland, Chinese Taiwan and Chinese Hong Kong and together the three parts form Great China\u2026'\n\nShe adds: 'At the moment, Taiwan and Hong Kong are not supervised by us because we manage mainland China.'\n\nThe student replies: 'I think if you are introducing China, Taiwan must be included in the map.'\n\n'Taiwan and Hong Kong fall under the Asia Pacific region. Hong Kong is a very important part for our business, therefore it is [managed] by a separate region that is Asia Pacific,' the presenter answers.\n\nThe student keeps pressing, asking how the presenter feels about Dior listing Taiwan as a Japanese city on its website.\n\n'I am not too sure how Taiwan was presented on the official website, but I believe the LVMH group is very professional in the field and will not do anything that goes against the Chinese law,' the presenter says.\n\nThe hashtag 'Dior statement' has gathered more than 290 million views and 15,000 comments on Twitter-like Weibo as of writing. Many web users have called for a boycott against the label\n\nMany Chinese stars have involved in the brand's campaigns.

It's represented by a number of Chinese celebrities, including Eurasian actress Yang Ying, known by her stage name Angelababy.\n\nChina reacts strongly to any brand that appears to insult its territorial sovereignty.\n\nThe hashtag 'Dior statement' has gathered more than 290 million views and 15,000 comments on Twitter-like Weibo as of writing.\n\nVersace's brand ambassador, actress Yang Mi (left), said she would stop collaborating with the Italian fashion house after it listed Hong Kong as a separate country on its T-shirts (right)\n\nSupermodel Liu Wen (left, seen in 2017) said 'the integrity of Chinese sovereignty and territory shall not be violated at any time' after Coach failed to list Hong Kong under China (right)\n\n'Haven't we talked about this many times this year?
