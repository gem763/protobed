Britain\u2019s ruling Conservative government has failed to deliver it. The Labour opposition can\u2019t agree on whether it wants it or not. Parliament is deadlocked.\n\nThe political vacuum has been happily filled by a familiar face who played a major role in bringing about the EU referendum in 2016, and the outcome.\n\nNigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party has been surging ahead in opinion polls in the run-up to the European Parliament elections. This is despite the fact that the party is only weeks old and has no detailed policies.\n\nIt\u2019s thought a successful result for the new party could push Britain\u2019s ruling Conservative government to pursue a harder Brexit. The UK is now due to leave the EU on October 31.\n\nFarage\u2019s objectives go beyond getting the UK out of the EU. The veteran Eurosceptic now says he also wants \u201cto change politics for good.\u201d\n\nWhat explains the Brexit Party\u2019s appeal?\n\nREUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nThe European vote has given Nigel Farage a perfect opportunity to tap into widespread public anger at the Brexit delay and the parliamentary paralysis. Nearly three years after the referendum, these are the elections the UK was not expected to fight.\n\nAmid the political turmoil, public opinion has polarised still further. Just as pro-EU supporters have been emboldened in their opposition to Brexit, anti-EU and English nationalist sentiment has hardened too.\n\nFarage has successfully established clear blue water between his new movement and the UK Independence Party he once led. Since he left, UKIP has had several leaders and has openly flirted with the far-right.\n\nIn contrast, Brexit Party enthusiasts highlight the diversity of its candidates, who include people from a variety of ethnic, social and political backgrounds.\n\nBut there is little doubt that for many people, much of its appeal is down to the charisma of its leader and his message.\n\nDespite the anger and frustration, Brexit Party events have been rather joyous, festive occasions. Halls and stadiums have been packed. People attending have said they feel \u201clet down\u201d by the two main parties, \u201csick\u201d of being misrepresented by \u201cremainers\u201d, and that the failure to implement the Brexit vote is \u201cthreatening democracy\u201d.\n\nBoth the main parties are feeling the heat, suffering badly in recent local elections. A survey of Conservative Party members found 60 percent were planning to vote for Brexit Party candidates at the European ballot. The Labour opposition\u2019s ambiguous stance on Brexit has dented its appeal to voters on both sides of the divide.\n\nMany at the rallies, but by no means all, are middle-aged or older \u2013 while the Brexit Party is forecast to do well in more affluent districts as well as working-class areas, particularly in England.\n\nIt attracts support from both the right and left. Audiences in traditional Labour strongholds have warmly applauded Ann Widdecombe, a Brexit Party convert who made her career on the right of the Conservative Party.\n\nREAD: Support for new Brexit Party surges amid voter backlash\n\nREAD: Brexit Guide: where are we now?\n\nWhat is the Brexit Party\u2019s plan?\n\nAnti-Brexit protester stands next to Brexit Party campaign placards. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nWhere in the past political parties have been pilloried for vagueness, Nigel Farage has made a virtue of his lack of a detailed programme. The Brexit Party has no manifesto, he says, because \u201cmanifesto equals lie\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will talk about all those things after the 23 May,\u201d he said recently. \u201cRight now\u2026 we are fighting and campaigning to make sure that we can be a free, independent, self-governing, democratic nation.\u201d\n\nThe European Union is no longer even his main theme. In a Brexit Party election broadcast, the EU isn\u2019t even mentioned until towards the end. Instead, candidates describe how they feel \u201cbetrayed\u201d and \u201chumiliated\u201d by politicians, leaving democracy \u201cunder threat\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur task and our mission is to change politics for good, to change all aspects of politics in this country,\u201d Farage told the campaign launch. So far there are few details of what that means.\n\nPolls suggest that many who voted to leave the EU have been increasingly lured by a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit \u2013 a departure without any agreement on the withdrawal terms or future relations.\n\nIts advocates have increasingly pushed for a clear break from the EU to trade on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can deliver the democratic will of the people is to leave on WTO terms,\u201d Farage told the BBC. \u201cOnce we do that, the European Union will be banging our door down to have a sensible, tariff-free deal.\u201d\n\nThe UK could leave the EU and then negotiate new arrangements afterwards, he said in a recent TV interview.\n\nFarage\u2019s claim that he argued for a no deal Brexit before the EU referendum is disputed.\n\nWhat would \u2018leaving on WTO terms\u2019 mean?\n\nPro-Brexit economists and politicians argue that as most global trade is done on WTO terms, the UK could open up to the world while still maintaining access to EU markets.\n\nThe counter-argument \u2013 expressed by many other economists, business groups and politicians \u2013 is that a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit would be an act of reckless folly, causing immediate disruption and damaging the economy.\n\nThey contest Farage\u2019s claim that the EU would quickly strike a free-trade deal with the UK. The British government says the EU would treat the UK as \u201ca third country\u201d.\n\nThe EU is the UK\u2019s largest trading partner. By quitting the single market and customs union, Britain would be free to implement its own trade policy.\n\nBut in the absence of a deal with the EU it would also face new barriers such as tariffs and regulations. Dozens of EU trade agreements with non-EU countries would no longer apply to the UK.\n\nAnalysts and British economic sectors reliant on close, smooth arrangements with Europe have warned that being forced to adapt to new rules overnight brings dangers. Among those sounding alarm bells are manufacturing industries \u2013 including the car, food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals \u2013 as well as the health service, tourism, and financial services. There have also been warnings over farming and fishing \u2013 despite strong support for Brexit from within these two sectors.\n\nAnn Widdecombe \u2013 a Brexit Party candidate for southwest England \u2013 dismissed fears that Devon farmers may be put out of business as \u201cproject fear mark two\u201d.\n\nNigel Farage has argued that the UK could slash tariffs on imports, helping poorer people by making food and clothes cheaper. Such claims have also been disputed by commentators and economists.\n\nThe Brexit Party leader also rejects fears that a no-deal Brexit would lead to extra delays at borders, saying tariffs could be logged online and on mobile phones. \u201cBusiness finds a way through every different situation,\u201d The Guardian quoted him as saying.\n\nA UK-EU free trade deal would render the Irish border \u201ca non-issue\u201d, Farage has claimed, because there would be no excise duties to collect and any future differences in specification could be easily dealt with.\n\nHe also believes a hard border should not be necessary because Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic already manage without one, despite different currencies and tax rates.\n\nMany trade experts and Brexit analysts reject the repeated denials among some Brexiteers that the Irish border problem is real, as well as their suggested solutions.\n\nREAD:No-deal Brexit: what would 'WTO terms' mean for UK-EU trade?\n\nREAD: No-deal Brexit: everything you need to know?\n\nWhat about areas other than trade?\n\nIf the UK left the EU with no deal on the terms, existing legal arrangements would abruptly cease to apply. It would affect many aspects of everyday life \u2013 from travel between the UK and the EU, to security, crime and terrorism.\n\nThe government\u2019s most senior civil servant has warned that a no deal Brexit would lead to a recession and price rises, and harm Britain's security apparatus and legal system.\n\nNigel Farage argues that a no deal Brexit would allow the UK to \u201cmake its own laws, have its own courts and control its own borders\u201d.\n\nHe has repeatedly argued for EU nationals who moved to the UK before Brexit to be able to stay \u2013 but he has criticised the British government\u2019s plans for citizens' rights in the event of no deal.\n\nEU countries and the UK have both moved to secure the rights of citizens on both sides of the English Channel in such a scenario, but campaigners have warned they will be watered down.\n\nREAD: What would a no-deal Brexit mean for citizens\u2019 rights \u2013 EU and UK expats?\n\nREAD: How would a no-deal Brexit affect travel and consumers?\n\nIs 'Faragism' becoming like 'Trumpism'?\n\nREUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s always a few years ahead of us,\u201d Nigel Farage said recently.\n\nHe has long praised Donald Trump, while the US president has suggested that his British admirer should be the UK\u2019s ambassador to the US.\n\nThe Brexit Party leader has not expressed the same level of hostility to mainstream media \u2013 although one commentator saw similarities with Trump in Farage\u2019s recent interview with the BBC, which he described as \u201cthe enemy\u201d.\n\nInterviewer Andrew Marr revisited Farage\u2019s past comments on health service privatisation, climate change, gun control, immigration, and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Guardian has also highlighted past interviews with a far-right US talk show.\n\nLike Trump, he has long accused elites of looking after their own interests and betraying the people. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said recently that far from draining the swamp of politics, Farage and his associates were \u201cthe people who created the swamp\u201d.\n\nThe Brexit Party does not openly advocate Trump-like tactics. Election candidate Alexandra Phillips has called for a positive response to \u201cremainers\u2019 slurs and smears\u201d by highlighting the \u201cmany moral arguments for Brexit\u201d.\n\nAfter the 2016 EU referendum, Nigel Farage left frontline politics. Now back with a mission to complete an unfinished job, he has vowed to harden his stance.\n\n\u201cI did say if I ever had to come back into the political spectrum, there\u2019d be no more Mr Nice Guy,\u201d he said at his new party\u2019s campaign launch. \u201cAnd I mean it. I\u2019m angry about what\u2019s happened.\u201d", "description": "Opinion polls give Nigel Farage's Brexit Party a clear lead in the runup to the European elections, with many voters angry at the UK's failure to leave the EU.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/89/47/68/1000x563_cmsv2_8d2696f7-8bb4-5b32-a9da-f423d5c7295a-3894768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-17"}
