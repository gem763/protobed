Schiff and demanded his recusal from the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThey are now fact witnesses in the same investigation that they are now running,\u201d said Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas. \u201cNowhere else in the United States can you be both a fact witness and prosecutor of any kind, much less an investigation to remove the president from office.\u201d\n\nMr. Schiff, California Democrat, acknowledged this week his office had been in contact with the whistleblower before the complaint was filed over President Trump\u2019s conversation with leader of Ukraine.\n\nMr. Ratcliffe said Mr. Schiff needs to be removed from helming the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cIt is entirely inappropriate and Chairman Schiff should disqualify himself from running this investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Schiff said last month his team had not spoken to the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,\u201d he told MSNBC in September. \u201cWe would like to, but I\u2019m sure the whistleblower has concerns that has not been advised as the law requires by the inspector general or the director of national intelligence just as to how we is to communicate with Congress.\u201d\n\nBut media reports surfaced this week contradict that account. The New York Times and others reported the whistleblower had reached out to a House Intelligence Committee aide before filing the compliant.\n\nThe committee then directed the whistleblower to report it to Mr. Atkinson, which is standard protocol for reporting intelligence community concerns.\n\nDuring his testimony Friday, Mr. Atkinson was unable to shed any light on contacts between the whistleblower and Democrats, according to Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe inspector general for the intelligence community can provide no information about the contacts between the HPSI majority and the whistleblower prior to his involvement,\u201d Mr. Ratcliffe said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
