But when the tests were repeated in the coolness of the lab - at around 10C - the ants moved far slower 5.7 cm per second, compared to the 85 recorded in the wild.\n\nAmong the small handful of creatures with a faster relative speed than the Saharan silver ant is the Australian tiger beetles -171body lengths per second - and California coastal mites - 377body lengths per second.\n\nDue to the heat and the threat from predators, Saharan silver ants tend to spend no more than 10 minutes a day outside the safety of their nests.\n\nThe new research is published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.", "description": "The world\u2019s fastest ant has been discovered, a desert-living creature which \u201cgallops\u201d over the scorching sand faster, relative to its body size, than a cheetah.", "authors": ["Henry Bodkin", "Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/science/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213186088-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwTNivb3VbRPkF_b-vPIpgck.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
