But he also made plain that there were no circumstances in which he would ask Brussels to delay our departure from the EU.\n\nAnd that means only one thing. Calling an election if, in his view, he needs to. When would he need to do that? Soon.\n\nIn No 10's judgement, if MPs, including many of his former colleagues, defeat him this week and succeed in their move to make leaving the EU without a deal illegal, their best move is to call an election, and call one quickly, as soon as 14 October.\n\nThe move is to focus the minds of Tory MPs tempted to vote against the government's position.\n\nDowning Street's upping the ante still further - if they are part of efforts to outlaw no deal, then they will be part of forcing a general election, and stand by to watch Boris Johnson's backers point the finger at them.\n\nBut those rebels are confident of their numbers. And few of them so far seem likely to be moved by Downing Street's threats. No 10 knows therefore, they are likely to lose.\n\nProtest he might, but Boris Johnson is dangling the threat of this election knowing full well that it is one he is more likely than not to have to follow through. He would, of course, have to persuade Parliament to back an election, and Downing Street is ready to put a motion down to that precise effect.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn may well be suspicious of the PM's motives, but has always said that he'd back a poll.\n\nSo a leader who is yet to take his first Prime Minister's Questions at the despatch box may ask almost immediately for all of our judgements on whether he deserves to lead.\n\nBrexit is again rewiring our politics - its eventual shape unknown.", "description": "Boris Johnson insists he does not want to call an early poll but he may be forced to do so.", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D992/production/_108589655_mediaitem108589394.jpg"}
