This year's Financial Review Rich List, which continues a tradition of measuring the wealth of the nation's richest people that began at BRW in 1983, is topped by paper manufacturing and recycling tycoon Anthony Pratt.\n\nPratt was also in first place in the 2009 edition, with a $4.3 billion fortune, meaning Pratt and Packer are the only people in the Rich List's 34-year history to top the list eight years apart.\n\nPratt's wealth reaches a record $12.6 billion this year, at a time when a seemingly never-ending property boom and a resurgence in commodity prices has made many of this year's 200 rich listers wealthier than ever.\n\nAustralia's richest man Anthony Pratt's company has launched a major lawsuit against almost 70 workers in his packaging giant empire over claims of unlawful industrial action. Nic Walker\n\nTotal wealth on the list is $233.1 billion, meaning the average wealth of each rich lister is $1.16 billion, the first time average wealth has been more than $1 billion. There are also more billionaires than in any previous year \u2013 60 to be exact, up from 53 a year ago.\n\nRich List editor John Stensholt", "description": "Explore the 34th edition of the BRW Rich 200 list, featuring the wealthiest Australians and how they earned their fortune.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_800%2C$height_450/t_crop_fill/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/24f3ba6333335cf84fd4a86732dc571129f83c34", "published_at": "2017-05-25"}
