Will it be the last one?", "language": "en", "text": "The console will also have a solid-state drive, which promises faster load times and read speeds for data, a new CPU that should help consoles keep pace with higher-end PC rigs and 8K resolutions.\n\nAD\n\nThe console will compete with Microsoft\u2019s yet-to-be-officially-named console, still dubbed Project Scarlett, as well as Nintendo\u2019s Switch handheld-hybrid machine.\n\nAD\n\nBoth behemoths will arrive before the holidays next year in what many industry observers surmise might be the last generation of consoles, thanks to the promise of an all-digital future of streaming games.\n\nSony also gave details about the PlayStation 5 controller in a blog post Tuesday morning. The controller will feature what the company calls \u201cadaptive triggers,\u201d which can be programmed for tactile resistance, replicating the sensation of pulling the string on a bow.\n\nGone will be the \u201crumble\u201d vibration technology, fully replaced by haptic feedback, the broad spectrum of vibration types you would find in more recent iPhones. Haptic technology was introduced with PlayStation 3\u2032s controllers.\n\nAD\n\nThe Wired reporter tried a prototype of the controller, playing through the virtual reality game \u201cAstro Bot Rescue Mission.\" The game features many surface types for the Astro Bot to run over, and the reporter said the controller\u2019s vibrations gave \u201cdistinct\u2014and surprisingly immersive\u2014tactile experiences,\u201d like mud feeling slow and soggy.\n\nAD\n\nFor the last six years, Sony held the pole position for video game consoles. PlayStation 4 sold 100 million consoles worldwide by June, making it the fastest to reach that milestone. The Xbox One has sold roughly half that amount, while the Nintendo Switch has sold more than 36 million at a speed similar to the PlayStation 4.\n\nBoth consoles come at the same time bets are being made on an all-digital, cloud-only gaming future, with Google Stadia looming on the horizon. Microsoft itself is testing its upcoming xCloud service for Xbox One-level gaming on your Android phone in select markets.\n\nAD\n\nMany gaming executives are predicting this to be the last generation of consoles. Ubisoft chief executive Yves Guillemot told Variety last year that an all-streaming future will make gaming more accessible to players. Executives at large software publishers like Square Enix and Take-Two Interactive Software also expressed doubts about how much excitement another generation of consoles can offer.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since graphical technology has excited people, and this appears to be an opportunity to once again amaze the gaming audience. Even PC gamers have a lot to look forward to for the next generation. Because of the popularity of consoles, developers often used aging PlayStation 4 hardware as the basis for their games, holding back performance on products that could be made for higher-end PCs.\n\nPC World says because the PlayStation 5 will feature technology even PC gamers can\u2019t own yet, and that the next console generation should \u201csurely rise all boats.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "With Sony's official announcement, the great video game console war will continue for yet another generation.", "authors": ["Gene Park"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yEod9ckUTHHOa5gHmbLAvqEULho=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HWW7NRHETUI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
