The seven-game winning streak is their longest since winning eight straight during the 1984-85 seasons. SMU (3-0 American) remains in first place in the West Division.\n\nTemple (5-2, 2-1) scored on a 1-yard runs by Ra\u2019Mahn Davis and Anthony Russo and a 25-yard pass from Russo to Branden Mack. The Owls are one game behind first-place Cincinnati in the East.\n\nBuechele, in his first year at SMU after playing the previous three years at Texas, was 30 for 53 passing. He also threw touchdown passes of 10 yards each to James Proche and Kylen Granson and 5 yards to Xavier Jones. Buechele\u2019s previous yardage high was 375 as a Longhorn in 2017.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTemple: Facing an undefeated opponent on the road, the Owls made too many mistakes early. That began on their first offensive play, when Isaiah Wright dropped a wide-open pass that would have been a 23-yard gain into SMU territory.\n\nSMU: The Mustangs went into Saturday ranked 99th in FBS pass defense allowing 259.3 yards per game but held Temple to 204 while continuing to be strong against the run (69 yards).\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTemple: The Owls will try for their ninth straight home win next Saturday against UCF.\n\nSMU: The Mustangs will visit Houston on Thursday night having lost six straight road games to the Cougars.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/College football and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Shane Buechele set career highs with six touchdown passes and 457 passing yards as No. 19 SMU improved to 7-0 with a 45-21 win over Temple on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/temple_smu_football_96720_c0-206-3002-1957_s1200x700.jpg?7e34d55d40441ae4ecb73b031afb60f2c18ae2c2", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
