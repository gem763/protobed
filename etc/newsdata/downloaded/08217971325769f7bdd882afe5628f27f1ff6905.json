I can see myself driving this black beauty, it really stands out.\n\nGALLERY | Isuzu D-Max X-Rider Black\n\n\"I am happy to see it back in our product portfolio and I know our customers will be happy to see it in our showrooms.\"\n\nAll black everything\n\nThe bakkie is coated in an exclusive Black Meet Kettle body colour which also includes its eye-catching 18-inch black alloy wheels and additional matt black accessories like the roof rails, side steps and a sports bar.\n\n\n\nIt will be available for a limited period in South Africa at all Isuzu dealerships across the country.\n\nImage: Quickpic\n\n\"It\u2019s bold, stylish and in your face. The X-Rider Black is for people who want to stand out in the urban jungle. It brings all the familiar Isuzu attributes of rugged reliability but will not look out of place parked in an upmarket urban-setting,\" says Dominic Rimmer, IMSA Executive Technical Services.\n\n\n\nThere are no changes under the bonnet as it still makes use of the popular 2.5-litre, 4-cylinder, turbo-diesel powerplant, found in the previously known KB models, that produces 100kW and 320Nm while fuel economy is rated at 7.7 l/100km. All of this is mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox.\n\nThe dark horse\n\nOn the outside, the X-Rider Black comes with integrated LED daytime running lights and front fog lights. Other features include a front bumper guard and projector headlights.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Quickpic\n\nThe dark theme is carried through to the interior as well with black leather seats featuring red stitching with the 'X-Rider' logo embroidered on the headrest. The red stitching is also used for the leather-trimmed steering wheel.\n\n\n\nAll models come standard with an 8-inch AX2 touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth for audio streaming and handsfree calling.\n\nImage: Quickpic\n\nIt also features a host of safety items including Electronic Brake-Force Distribution (EBD), Brake-Assist System (BAS), Electronic Stability Control (ESC) with Traction Control, Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), driver and passenger airbags, and Side-Impact Protection Bars.\n\nFor those looking to purchase one of those limited edition mean machines, it is priced at R462 000.\n\n\n\nIt comes standard with a 5-year or 120 000km bumper-to-bumper warranty, 5-year or unlimited km anti-corrosion warranty and a 5-year or 90 000km service plan.\n\n", "description": "The Isuzu D-Max, formerly known as the KB, has become a popular choice for many and has now added a new model to the range with the introduction of a limited edition X-Rider Black.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2814/de7d51649e85480cb61cb58c7d217ca3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
