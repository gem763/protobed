Power 2019 North America Airport Satisfaction Study ranked passenger satisfaction with North American airports on a 1,000-point scale in the mega, large and medium size categories.\n\nIn the 'mega' category, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport ranks highest in passenger satisfaction with a score of 786.\n\nMinneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport/Wold (779) ranks second among the megas, while Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (777) and Orlando International Airport (777) rank third in a tie.\n\nMajor construction is seen underway outside LaGuardia, which was ranked the worst in a new study of passenger satisfaction at North American airports\n\nThis J.D. Power chart shows the 2019 passenger satisfaction scores for 'mega' sized airports\n\nAmong large airports, Oregon's Portland International Airport ranks highest with a score of 833. Dallas Love Field (826) ranks second and Tampa International Airport (822) ranks third.\n\nIn the medium category, Indianapolis International Airport ranks highest with a score of 833. Jacksonville International Airport (831) ranks second and Buffalo Niagara International Airport (829) ranks third.\n\nAcross all categories, LaGuardia ranks the worst, with a score of 662. Newark was second worst at 695, and Honolulu International was third at 719.\n\nThe study's authors said that major construction projects and the disruption they cause had a significant impact on passenger satisfaction this year.\n\nThis J.D. Power chart shows the 2019 passenger satisfaction scores for large sized airports\n\n'With major terminal construction projects now underway in Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, Atlanta and many other airports, it is becoming impossible for travelers not to experience some form of disruption,' said Michael Taylor, Travel Intelligence Lead at J.D. Power, in a statement.\n\n'While these projects are absolutely necessary to address surging demand, they are currently causing passenger delays and confusion,' he added.\n\n'This translates into a rushed passenger experience and less money spent on food, beverage and retail\u2014and it's slowing the progress of the airport satisfaction we've seen in the past several years.'\n\nA long line of travelers waits to board a flight at Newark International Airport last year. Newark ranked second-worst overall in a new passenger satisfaction survey\n\nThis J.D. Power chart shows the 2019 passenger satisfaction scores for medium sized airports\n\nThe overall customer satisfaction score this year for North American airports was 762, up just one point from 2018.\n\nThe study noted that the experience of getting through airport security\u2014a perennial drag on airport satisfaction scores\u2014has improved five points.\n\nThe authors attribute this to improved TSA processing and more widespread adoption of biometric screening technologies that move passengers through security faster.", "description": "The J.D.
