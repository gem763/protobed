Photo: Rio Viera-Newton\n\nAlexis Page has worked in the beauty industry for nearly 15 years. She started off as a product developer at M.A.C.; helped launch Glossier (out of Emily Weiss\u2019s apartment); worked alongside the matriarch of runway makeup, Pat McGrath; and, most recently, developed Ohii, Urban Outfitter\u2019s affordable in-house skin-care and makeup line. Every single person in the beauty industry knows Alexis: She\u2019s just that good. And I\u2019m not just saying that because she\u2019s my friend.\n\nIt probably won\u2019t surprise you to hear that Alexis also happens to have the world\u2019s best beauty recommendations. She knows the ins and outs of beauty production \u2014 from what it takes to make a good SPF to how to create a longwear lipstick \u2014 like the back of her hand. So when she says a formula is special, I trust her implicitly.\n\nLast week, we sat on the floor of her East Village apartment, poking around boxes filled with old product testers and Pat McGrath lipstick archives as we chatted about her favorite French pharmacy finds, why she loves a natural retinol, and her affection for taupe-colored eye shadows.\n\nFirst of all, what\u2019s your skin type? And what\u2019s important to you in a skin-care product?\n\nI used to have really severe acne in college, and went on Accutane, which really worked. I don\u2019t really break out now, but in my mind, I still have terrible skin. I have some residual acne scarring, which can get kind of red and ruddy \u2014 so making sure my skin is calm and my texture is consistent are the two most important things to me. I\u2019m really into vitamin C for brightening up my complexion and making sure my skin tone is even. I especially love the Paula\u2019s Choice vitamin C serum \u2014 it\u2019s 15 percent vitamin C.\n\nAny other brightening products you\u2019re into?\n\nI actually am obsessed with the Ohii vitamin C Mask. I put it on dry skin, wait for five minutes, then get in the shower and wash it off. It\u2019s my favorite pre-event or pre-going-out mask because it makes my face look glowy right away.\n\nohii Before + After Vitamin C Mask $16 (was $24, now 33% off) $16 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nI see you have some Summer Fridays in your cupboard. What are some of your other favorite masks?\n\nI use the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask as a sleeping mask if my skin feels sad, or I\u2019ve used too many acids, or if I\u2019ve happened to spend too much time in the sun, it\u2019s very reparative. I also like the Cosrx\u2019s Honey Sleep Mask \u2014 it feels kind of sticky but it\u2019s deeply hydrating. Also, this is crazy because this brand kind of came and went \u2014 but I love the original GlamGlow Supermud mask. [Editor\u2019s note: Buzz Bissinger is also a superfan of the Supermud mask.] I don\u2019t like any of their other products, but this one is what I reach for when I want to look in the mirror and literally watch dirt or gunk come out of my nose pores and chin.\n\nDo you have a cleanser you like?\n\nI\u2019m a serious product junkie, and I\u2019ll sometimes try a different cleanser every day. But I do find myself coming back to a couple of classics. The Biologique VIP O2 is one of my favorites \u2014 it just feels great on my skin. People sometimes say it\u2019s the same as Cetaphil, which I hate \u2014 they\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s much, much better.\n\nI know you\u2019re a big-time drugstore skin-care person. Any good cleanser finds there?\n\nWhen I was little, I spent a lot of time with my grandma and she was obsessed with beauty. We\u2019d watch a beauty pageant every time we were together. And we used to go to this place that\u2019s kind of in between a CVS and a Target and she\u2019d buy me beauty products that I\u2019d bring home and put on my shelf, just to look at. So yes, I\u2019m a drugstore person and I have some drugstore favorites: Aveeno\u2019s Positively Radiant Micellar Gel Cleanser, and the La Roche Posay Physiological Cleansing Milk. Both are such great, lightweight, hydrating, neutral formulas and they\u2019re amazing for removing makeup.\n\nSo what about toners and exfoliants for evening out textural issues? I notice you have the Ordinary\u2019s AHA/BHA peel. Do you like that?\n\nI like it fine. I think the Ordinary is great for people who want to try out new types of products \u2014 everything is so cheap, so it\u2019s a good way to figure out what ingredients work well for you without breaking the bank. But I find their packaging is incredibly confusing, and their products are all such high concentration, which I think is a little dangerous \u2014 if you\u2019re a product rookie, you could easily overdo it with their vitamin C, for instance, and really irritate your skin. Personally, I use the Dr. Dennis Gross Peel Pads for keeping my skin smooth \u2014 they\u2019re incredibly convenient, and quite strong. I use them every other day, which my sensitive skin handles fine.\n\nDr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel $150 at Dermstore Buy\n\nOh yeah, I love those for traveling. What about creams? You mentioned your skin is super dry these days. What do you use to make sure you don\u2019t wake up with cracked, flaky skin?\n\nAnother drugstore love, actually: L\u2019Oreal\u2019s Cica Cream. It has a really nice low-level retinol in it which helps with fine lines and wrinkles and makes sure my skin tone looks nice and even.\n\nUnscented L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Cicacream Anti-Wrinkle + Skin Barrier Repair $10 at Target Buy\n\nI\u2019m seeing it also has Centella in it, which is one of my favorite K-beauty ingredients for calming the skin.\n\nYeah, on top of the retinol magic, it\u2019s also really calming and soothing. While we\u2019re on the topic of retinol, I love, love Ole Henriksen\u2019s retinol cream. In the past six months, this has probably been my number one product find. It has bachuki oil, a natural retinol alternative, that I\u2019ve found has worked really great for plumping and evening out my skin. And since it\u2019s a natural retinol, rather than a synthetic one, you can use it every day and it won\u2019t make your skin flake or peel like a regular retinol. Also, it has a major brightening effect.\n\nSurely with all this retinol you must have a really solid SPF in your skin-care routine.\n\nYes. My everyday sunscreen is actually from Solid and Striped; I helped them develop it. It\u2019s insanely lightweight \u2014 it has a serum-y texture to it. It\u2019s also vegan, reef-safe, and leaves no white cast.\n\nWait, I actually adore this sunscreen. I have a go-to K-beauty sunscreen (my Purito Centella), but when it runs out, my backup is the S&S one. Another thing the world needs to know about you is that you\u2019re a deodorant aficionado.\n\nCorrect. Basically every post I wrote for Into the Gloss was about deodorant. I want my deodorants to ensure I\u2019m not stinky, but I also really hate when they\u2019re overwhelmingly fragranced. If I have an important meeting or event I use Biotherm Deodorant, because it\u2019s an antiperspirant, so it helps me stop sweating. But on the day-to-day I wear Ohii\u2019s deodorant\u2014 it\u2019s not going to stop you from sweating, but you\u2019ll never smell with it on, either.\n\nAnything for the body that you love?\n\nMy favorite body product right now is this Necessaire exfoliant. It\u2019s super-gentle on the skin, and totally scentless and nonsticky. Plus, I can put it on before bed and it doesn\u2019t cling to my sheets. One of my number one products of all time, though, is this French cream called Biafine Emulsion \u2014 it\u2019s truly one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Basically, while I was still at M.A.C. one hundred years ago, I had a terrible sunburn and my colleague told me I needed to order it, which I did, and it immediately transformed my scathing, hot, red burn into a golden tan. Now I use it on scars, scrapes, bug bites \u2014 anything and everything, really, it\u2019s like a weird magical potion. It\u2019s something a lot of French people keep in their first-aid kits.\n\nIs there a product out there you love so much you wish you\u2019d created it?\n\nThe Beautyblender. It\u2019s so genius. I\u2019ve tried every single Beautyblender dupe, and in my opinion they\u2019re never half as good as the original.\n\nAgreed! Let\u2019s get into makeup. What are your go-tos?\n\nMy favorite brow gel of all time is this one from Milani, which I think is being discontinued so stock up on it while you can. The brush size is just right, and it keeps my brows in place all day long. Another brow thing I\u2019m obsessed with is this NYX brow pencil. It\u2019s exactly the same as the Tom Ford in texture and effect but it\u2019s insanely cheap, under $10.\n\nNYX Professional Makeup Fill & Fluff Eyebrow Pomade Pencil $8 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nDo you have a blush or bronzer that you love?\n\nI\u2019m completely and totally obsessed with the D-Bronzi bronzer from Drunk Elephant. It\u2019s the best. It\u2019s super sheer and blendable and looks just like a natural tan. I use my fingers and tap it onto the hollows of my cheeks and then basically all over. And for blush, I really like this Josie Maran blush oil \u2014 it\u2019s so buildable.\n\nYour skin always looks perfect. What are you using for foundation and concealer?\n\nI weirdly love Kim\u2019s KKW Beauty Concealer. I like how full coverage yet blendable it is; it stays put all day and doesn\u2019t crease or move around. I\u2019m also very obsessed with the M.A.C.\u2019s Face and Body foundation which creates this beautiful light-coverage wash of color. The formula is really similar to Glossier\u2019s Skin Tint, but the M.A.C. one has this polymer that kind of molds to your face and lifts it up. Some products feel kind of granular, almost cakey, on your skin \u2014 this doesn\u2019t.\n\nDo you have a go-to lip?\n\nI love all of Pat\u2019s lipsticks, but I\u2019m very into mauve-y shades lately, so I\u2019ve been wearing her shade Lavish. The color is so special and the packaging is, as always with her, amazing. Speaking of lipsticks, I also weirdly love this MUJI lipstick I got in Japan a while ago. It\u2019s super-moisturizing and it\u2019s a very pretty rose color.\n\nPat Mcgrath LuxeTrance Lipstick in Lavish $40 at Sephora Buy\n\nEye stuff?\n\nThe best eye shadow of all time is this single eye shadow from Pat in the shade Statuesque. It\u2019s this gorgeous, natural taupe color, with these very subtle blue-lavender-y undertones that just add face-changing dimension to your eyes.\n\nPat Mcgrath Eyedols Eyeshadow in Statuesque $25 at Sephora Buy\n\nLast question: How do you store all of this?\n\nThere are no dishes in my kitchen cabinets. Seriously. It\u2019s just all beauty products.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
