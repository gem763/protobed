You wouldn't buy a house having only one week's notice of what the terms look like. You'd want a survey, you'd want to send in the experts, you'd want to know what the structure was and we think that's important now.\n\n\"We want to see the government's economic impacts and then we'll make a proper judgement.\"\n\n'Inferior' deal\n\nMr Wright also expressed reservations about the impact of the deal on Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Many of my members already think that the changes in Northern Ireland will make it too expensive for them to do business between Great Britain and Northern Ireland under the terms that may come,\" he said.\n\n\"And the political declaration has all sorts in it which is aspirational, but we need to know what we're going to look at in terms of trade deals and in terms of regulatory alignment and we're worried on both those counts.\"\n\nThe chief executive of manufacturers' organisation Make UK, Stephen Phipson, said Mr Johnson's deal was \"inferior in many respects to the deal we had with Theresa May's withdrawal agreement\".\n\n\"This problem of uncertainty is really quite critical now,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"We're seeing about 70% of manufacturers in the country not investing at the moment and critically, those European customers not coming to us for new orders.\"\n\nPound v Dollar\n\nThe comments from business leaders came as the pound slipped on the first day of currency trading since MPs backed a move to delay approval of the Brexit deal.\n\nOn Friday, sterling had been trading close to its highest level for five months against both the dollar and the euro.\n\nCurrency analysts say they expect the next strong movement in the pound to be when the Brexit deal is voted on in Parliament.\n\nHowever, after Saturday's vote, many believe a no-deal Brexit is now less likely. US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which issues regular updates to its clients, now thinks there is a 5% chance of a no-deal Brexit, down from 10% previously.", "description": "Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of Barclays' UK operations, says business leaders want to see certainty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FF0A/production/_109309256_iancheshire_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
