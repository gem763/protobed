To mark the month, we\u2019re sharing stories of breast cancer journeys.\n\nA pay it forward chain that began with two nurses in an Indianapolis neo-natal intensive care unit has allowed a mother of three battling breast cancer to feed her 10-month-old daughter breast milk.\n\nThe chain started when Katie Hanover, 29, a NICU nurse at Community Hospital North, gave birth last November nearly five weeks early.\n\nHanover\u2019s daughter, Maggie, spent six days in the same NICU where she works.\n\nPHOTO: Katie Hanover, 29, holds her then-newborn daughter, Maggie. (Community Hospital North) More\n\nHanover\u2019s coworker, Abby Black, who had her daughter Vivian just one month earlier, volunteered to donate her breast milk to Hanover.\n\n\"Just working in the NICU I\u2019ve been educated on the importance and value of human breast milk,\" Black said. \"It was something I had more than enough of, so it was an easy decision to make.\"\n\nPHOTO: Abby Black holds her daughter, Vivian. (Community Hospital North ) More\n\nOnce Hanover was able to breastfeed Maggie herself, she had a big enough supply that she too started donating her breast milk.\n\nWhen a lactation consultant at the hospital told Hanover about Kata Carter, a mother who was facing breast cancer, Hanover jumped at the chance to donate her breast milk to Carter.\n\n\"I knew that feeling and knew I wanted to pay it forward,\" she said. \"I was like, 'Absolutely. In a heartbeat.'\"\n\nPHOTO: Katie Hanover, 29, poses with her daughter, Maggie. (Community Hospital North) More\n\nCarter, 34, also of Indianapolis, was diagnosed in March with stage 3B inflammatory breast cancer, a rare subtype of the disease. She noticed a lump in one breast while breastfeeding her youngest daughter, Rosie, then just 3 months old.\n\n(MORE: How one mom is changing a town's law on breastfeeding in public)\n\n\"It was pure shock,\" she said of the diagnosis. \"I had run through what seemed like every scenario of what [the lump] could have been in my mind and cancer was not one of them.\"\n\nCarter said she was breastfeeding Rosie in her doctor\u2019s office when she received the cancer diagnosis. She had to stop breastfeeding almost immediately and began the first of six rounds of chemotherapy just a week later.\n\nPHOTO: Kata Carter reads a book to her three children.
