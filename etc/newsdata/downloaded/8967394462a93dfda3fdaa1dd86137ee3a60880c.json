Porgy and Bess. Photo: The English National Opera\n\nClassical music is a deadly misnomer because the art it describes is anything but marmoreal or sedate. You can hopscotch through a New York concert season from continent to continent and century to century, alighting in a different universe every night. But even if you just stick to 19th century Europe, the range of experiences is vast. Here\u2019s a tiny selection.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Great\n\nSeptember\n\n\u201cHoles in the Sky\u201d (National Sawdust; 9/13)\n\nPianist Lara Downes celebrates Clara Schumann\u2019s bicentennial by playing her works alongside music by generations of women in a range of styles, from Meredith Monk to Joni Mitchell and Paola Prestini.\n\nNew York Philharmonic (David Geffen Hall; 9/18\u20139/21)\n\nPolitics may have soured many on nostalgia for small-town America, but why not reclaim it with Samuel Barber\u2019s sepia-and-sunshine Knoxville: Summer of 1915, sung by the luminous Kelli O\u2019Hara? To round out the program, Jaap van Zweden conducts Prokofiev\u2019s Romeo and Juliet and a new overture from Philip Glass.\n\nPorgy and Bess (Metropolitan Opera; opens 9/23)\n\nGershwin\u2019s classic, which hasn\u2019t been seen at the Met in almost three decades, returns. Once a vehicle for black singers who were shut out of other parts, this time around it\u2019s being sung by operatic veterans.\n\n\u201cThe Angel\u2019s Share\u201d (Green-Wood Cemetery; 9/24\u20139/27)\n\nIf autumn puts you in the mood for a little meditation on mortality and transcendence, you could do worse than hear pianists Adam Tendler and Jenny Lin play movements of Liszt\u2019s Poetic and Religious Harmonies within earshot of some long-deceased New Yorkers. This kicks off a series of catacombs concerts, each with a whiskey prelude.\n\nOctober\n\nDaniil Trifonov\n\nThe super-pianist sometimes sounds as if he has 20 fingers and an extra hip flask full of soul. This fall, he gives a Carnegie Hall recital (10/16), plays Scriabin\u2019s mountainous piano concerto with the New York Philharmonic (11/27\u201330; 12/3), and joins the Philharmonic\u2019s string quartet to perform his own work at the 92nd Street Y (12/1).\n\nLes Arts Florissants (The Cloisters; 10/20)\n\nThe special-ops unit of early-music ensembles performs the exquisitely unsettling madrigals of Carlo Gesualdo, who got away with double murder thanks to his status as a prince. Best consumed in a venue with stone statues and churchy reverberations.\n\n\u201cJourney to the East\u201d (Alice Tully Hall; 10/24)\n\nMigration, eclecticism, and cultural exchange are not just contemporary phenomena; the early-music sage Jordi Savall uses music to retrace the travels of the 16th-century Jesuit St. Francis Xavier, who sailed from Lisbon to Japan and heard the sounds of many cultures along the way.\n\nDichterliebe (Gerald Lynch Theater; 10/29\u201310/30)\n\nVoices don\u2019t get more limpid than Ian Bostridge\u2019s tenor, and his rendition of Schumann\u2019s song cycle is poignantly crystalline. He sings it alongside a companion piece by Brad Mehldau (Zankel Hall; 10/24). A few days later, soprano Julia Bullock sings the same cycle in a staged version called Zauberland (\u201cMagic Land\u201d), directed by the ever-polarizing Katie Mitchell.\n\nDecember\n\nWozzeck (Metropolitan Opera; opens 12/27)\n\nThe artist and director William Kentridge can sometimes festoon stage works with so many images and ideas that he makes it hard to focus. But that overload should work for an opera about a man fighting his way through society\u2019s cacophony of instructions for how to live.\n\n*This article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
