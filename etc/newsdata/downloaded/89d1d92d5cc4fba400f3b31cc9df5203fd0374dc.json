Porsche said it is looking into the possibilities of future long-term cooperation.\n\nDetlev von Platen, Porsche executive board member for sales and marketing, said that Porsche \u201cis looking to enhance its scope as a sports car manufacturer by becoming a leading brand for premium mobility\u201d and that in the longer term \u201cthis could mean moving into the third dimension of travel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis would be a fully electric aircraft that takes off and lands vertically,\u201d a Porsche spokesperson said. \u201cWe are currently planning on a 2-seater with different flight modes: from manual to autonomous.\u201d The company will only present a product when it has been fully developed, and at the moment a \u201cfirst flight of a full-scale prototype is planned for 2020.\u201d\n\nPart of the cooperation with Boeing will involve researching the future market potential of airborne transport. A team of experts from both companies, with bases in the US, Germany, and Switzerland will explore the technical and business development aspects of urban air mobility.\n\nPorsche Consulting predicts that the urban air-transport market will start to really gather speed from 2025 onwards.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration builds on our efforts to develop a safe and efficient new mobility ecosystem and provides an opportunity to investigate the development of a premium urban air mobility vehicle with a leading automotive brand,\u201d said Steve Nordlund, vice president and general manager of Boeing NeXt.\n\nDaimler invested \u20ac25 million ($27.5m) into Germany-based flying taxi firm Volocopter in 2017. Volocopter, which is planning to launch its air taxi in Singapore on 22 October, is competing with the likes of Airbus and German startup Lilium. Techcrunch reported today that Lilium, whose backers include Tencent, may soon look to raise up to $500m in the race to be first in the skies.", "description": "German automaker and US-based Boeing forms urban air mobility partnership.", "authors": ["Jill Petzinger", "Germany Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hI31B0svtA75p0GMZA7ZTA--~B/aD0xNzU3O3c9MzEyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/5ea09fc0-eb65-11e9-bd9d-2427e639342f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
