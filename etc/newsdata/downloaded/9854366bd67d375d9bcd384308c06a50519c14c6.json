In 1995, 51% had a negative opinion and 42% had a positive opinion of the group.\n\nThe 1995 survey was conducted shortly after the organization sent out a widely criticized fundraising letter. The letter, citing the 1994 assault weapons ban, referred to federal agents as \u201cjack-booted thugs\u201d who were trying to take guns away from citizens. The reference prompted former President George H.W. Bush to discontinue his membership in the NRA in protest.", "description": "", "authors": ["News.Gallup.Com Poll Americans-Views-Nra-Become-Less-Positive.Aspx"], "top_image": ""}
