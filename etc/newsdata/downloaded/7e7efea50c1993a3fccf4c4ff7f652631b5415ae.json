However, the MSAC outlaws extra items into the cage without proper approval \u2013 which is also where Hardy got dinged.\n\nAbe Kawa, Hardy\u2019s manager, did not comment on whether the inhaler was approved.\n\nCONOR MCGREGOR, FRANKIE EDGAR CALL ON DANA WHITE TO MAKE UFC FIGHT HAPPEN\n\nUFC President Dana White criticized Hardy\u2019s coach Din Thomas for bringing the item, despite telling Yahoo Sports that the inhaler was approved by the MSAC.\n\nHardy issued a statement through UFC on the issue.\n\n\u201cI was in the ring, me and my coach asked the commission if it would be OK to use my inhaler and they said 'yes,' so I took it,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cI'm still [a] new guy in this sport, I did what I do in every situation \u2014 I asked permission, I got permission and I did what I was told.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nHardy moves to 5-1-1 in the UFC.
