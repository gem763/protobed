I\u2019m not going to change my position,\u201d Sanders said when asked about criticism she has faced in public places from the president\u2019s detractors. \u201cIt would be very odd to go from doing what I was doing, to all of a sudden doing something different,\u201d she added. \u201cI loved my experience. I loved working for the president. I think he has been able to do some tremendous things for the country, and I look forward to watching him do it for six more years.\u201d\n\nMessage sent \u2026 and message received:\n\nGreat interview of Sarah Sanders by @foxandfriends. She is a terrific person with a great future! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t expect any lawsuits involving Huckabee Sanders\u2019 non-disclosure agreement. (Madeleine Westerhout should take notes.)\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Huckabee Sanders is sincere in her outlook. She\u2019s not leaving out of disillusionment, nor push out like John Kelly or James Mattis. She has no reason to offer a \u201cseason of silence\u201d because she\u2019s still a true believer. Nothing wrong with that, of course, although it may be a novelty among former Trump administration officials. These days, publicly sticking with Trump support might even qualify as a Profile In Courage. (On other news networks, anyway.)\n\nHowever, Kilmeade touches on another reason that Huckabee Sanders wants to maintain a sunny outlook on the Trump White House. Kilmeade awkwardly asks her about her gubernatorial ambitions in Arkansas before quickly retreating, realizing that a direct answer would make it her first and last appearance as a Fox News contributor. Trump himself floated the idea when Huckabee Sanders announced her departure, and she\u2019s been reportedly discussing the idea seriously. Trump won Arkansas by 27 points in 2016, and Republicans swept the House races in 2018 in the middle of a moderate Democratic wave. Asa Hutchinson won his gubernatorial re-election bid that same year by almost 34 points.\n\nIt\u2019ll be three more years before Huckabee Sanders will get a shot at the office, when Hutchinson runs into term limits and will have to leave the seat open. If she wants to run for that seat, she won\u2019t improve her chances at it by becoming a Trump critic, especially one who betrays her \u201cconfidante\u201d to benefit herself. Expect plenty more sessions on the Fox & Friends couch like this debut \u2026 which is apparently what Fox wants, too.", "description": "\"I'm not going to change my position.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/huckabee-sanders-fox.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
