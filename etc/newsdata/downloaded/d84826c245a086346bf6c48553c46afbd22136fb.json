Wakatabe, a well-known reflationist, is seen as one of the board members pushing for more action.\n\nThe BOJ has indicated greater willingness to ramp up its easing measures amid a global slowdown and moves by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to bolster stimulus. Still, the BOJ is wary of the side effects on commercial banks and markets of its massive easing program, which is far larger in scale than the stimulus of any other major central bank.\n\nSo action in October is not a done deal. Incoming economic data and developments in financial markets before the end of policy meeting on Oct. 31 will be closely assessed by the bank to see if it really has to move.\n\n\u201cWhenever crisis hits, what we need is policy coordination,\" Wakatabe said. \u201cFiscal policy authorities and monetary policy authorities should cooperate to tackle the crisis situation.\u201d\n\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda has laid out four possible options for boosting stimulus -- cutting negative interest rates, lowering long term rates, expanding asset purchases and quickening the expansion of the monetary base.\n\nWakatabe, a former economics professor, has supported every decision by the board since taking the position in March last year.", "description": "BOJ's Wakatabe Wants to Get Out of Negative Rates as Soon as Can", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picd5380ec7d2626be45ad6b0bf55bd4da5.jpg"}
