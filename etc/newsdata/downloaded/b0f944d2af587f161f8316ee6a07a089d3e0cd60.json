The first third of the novel is apparently written from the perspective of Elio\u2019s now-divorced father, Sami, whose lust for life is reignited by a new, younger love. Elio moves to Paris and subsequently has a \u201cconsequential affair\u201d, while Oliver, a college professor in New England, thinks about returning to Europe. In the final part of the novel, Elio and Oliver reunite once more.\n\nSpeaking with Vogue, Aciman discussed the evolved, yet forever-intricate relationship between Elio and Oliver.\n\n\u201cThey are clearly more mature now and know how fragile life can be. They have both had other relationships, they know that they have to be careful and that a separation, should it occur again, would be devastating.\u201d\n\nAciman also discussed the importance of the sequel. \u201cFind Me gave me a sense of closure and finality. Of course, life is full of surprises and no road is without bumps or wrong turns. But I think this ends the tale of Elio and Oliver.\u201d\n\nHere's the cover of my forthcoming novel, FIND ME, where you'll rediscover Elio and Oliver.
