Earlier on Saturday, fights broke out between a group of pro-government demonstrators in blue T-shirts and residents in Fortress Hill after a Lennon wall had been torn down.\n\nVideos showed groups of men using Chinese flags to beat mostly younger men. In one scene, a group chased and kicked a young man until a passerby shielded him with his body.\n\nHundreds of anti-government protesters in masks and all-black outfits were also marching in Tin Shui Wai, a neighbourhood in Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories, defying a police ban on the planned event. Bus lines to the area were shut, as riot police faced off against protesters who were building barricades on the streets.\n\nSaturday marks the 15th consecutive weekend of mass protests in Hong Kong, where demonstrations against the government have deeply divided society. The protests, triggered by an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China, has turned into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has said that she will permanently withdraw the bill, but protesters have vowed to continue until all their demands are met. On Friday, thousands of protesters marked the mid-autumn festival by forming human chains across the city. Hundreds hiked to several peaks where they shined lanterns and torches.\n\nMore than 100 secondary school students gathered in central Hong Kong, where they sang Glory to Hong Kong, a song that has become the unofficial anthem of the protests, and stuck signs and posted messages along a wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m showing up to support the younger generation,\u201d said Cheng, 21, a university student attending the rally of secondary students. \u201cJust because one demand was fulfilled doesn\u2019t mean we should back down. We should keep fighting for all five of the demands.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are a lot less people showing up to these kinds of protests and gathering, and I hope Hong Kong people will still remember what happened within these three months.\u201d\n\nDuring the past week, demonstrators have gathered in malls across the city to sing the anthem, in a departure from previous weeks of violent street battles with police.\n\nObservers believe authorities are eager to stop the protests before 1 October, when China celebrates its national day, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nMany protesters believe it is a key date to apply more pressure on the government. One group has raised more than HK$8m (\u00a3820,000) to place adverts in the main newspapers on that day.", "description": "Pro-democracy demonstrators clash with Beijing supporters as riot police subdue protesters", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b51e01276290d780323927e688672a5e8372f0/0_308_4601_2760/master/4601.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75d44de8c75bfbda75cf39b3afff4e9f", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
