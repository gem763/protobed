Their bet on Waste Connections panned out, with the stock gaining 23% this year. It has also led to massive gains for the fund's investors in 2019.\n\nThe four-star rated fund is up 34.9% this year and is outperforming 97% of the funds in its category, according to Morningstar. The fund \u2014 which has $2.6 billion in assets \u2014 has also been on fire relative to the S&P 500, which is up 18.7% in 2019.\n\n\"The way we manage the portfolio and the way we think about things is we like balance and sales,\" said Warner, one of the fund's co-managers. \"We're growth managers but we like a balanced portfolio so we can do well in different market environments.\"\n\nConnor Young, an analyst at Morningstar, said that while the fund is a top performer, it has been vulnerable to big pullbacks in the market given its tilt towards high-growth companies. The fund, Young noted, posted a 20% loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 amid a sharp market downturn.\n\n\"But at their core, these are talented and experienced managers who \u2026 continue to carry out a proven approach that has delivered strong long-term results at this fund,\" Young said.", "description": "Waste Connections has the largest weight in the Wells Fargo Asset Management Discovery fund.
