'He wanted that, he was happy in the dressing room after the game and we hope this is the first of many.'\n\nSummer signing Eden Hazard celebrates his first Real Madrid goal on the stroke of half-time\n\nKarim Benzema celebrates his goal with team-mate Eden Hazard after just two minutes\n\nGareth Bale assisted Benzema's opener with classy, outside of the foot cross on Saturday\n\nAlvaro Odriozola impressed for Los Blancos at right back with attacking runs down the wing\n\nDani Carvajal missed a one-on-one chance after a superb first-half Real Madrid move\n\nMATCH FACTS Real Madrid: Areola, Carvajal, Ramos, Varane, Odriozola, Casemiro, Valverde, Kroos (Modric 34), Bale (Rodriguez 83), Benzema, Hazard (Isco 69). Subs not used: Militao, Jovic, Altube, Silva de Goes. Granada: Rui Silva, Victor Diaz, Duarte, German, Neva, Herrera, Azeez (Vadillo 51), Montoro (Gonalons 6), Machis, Soldado (Fernandez 64). Subs not used: Martinez, Koybasi, Escandell, Ramos.\n\nThe first to congratulate Hazard after his goal was Gareth Bale, he knows the importance of making a good start at the Bernabeu, he knows how difficult it has been for Hazard.\n\nBale also played his part in the win. He reminded Zidane why he probably should have been involved in midweek against Brugge with a velvet assist for Karim Benzema's opener.\n\nBenzema's goal came after just two minutes. Bale and Alvaro Odriozola charged down the right together. The young full back wanted Bale to run ahead of him but Bale signalled for Odriozola to go long and play the ball back to him.\n\nThe Real Madrid faithful were in full voice as Zinedine Zidane's side got another three points\n\nLuka Modric scored the goal of the game with his 25-yard screamer on the hour mark\n\nWhen he did Bale crossed with the outside of his left foot and Benzema did the rest \u2013 he loves scoring against Granada at the Bernabeu, this was his seventh in six games.\n\nFede Valverde should have made it two but his effort was easily saved by Rui Silva. Benzema then could have done better when Hazard sent him through with a neat pass around the corner.\n\nHazard then passed his own personal corner \u2013 a first goal in the league for Madrid running on to Valverde's clever prod through the middle and lobbing the advancing Rui Silva.\n\nThe win has lifted some pressure off the Real Madrid manager after Champions League worry\n\nReal Madrid's Sergio Ramos (L) in action against Granada's Antonio Puerta (R) at the Bernabeu\n\nIt looked all over when Luka Modric postage stamped a spectacular third for Real Madrid but Granada were not the team of September and a side who came into this fixure with a chance to go top without having some substance and they were gifted a path back into the match when clumsy Areola kicked Carlos Fernandez instead of the ball as he tried to play out from the back.\n\nIt was a reminder that Courtois is probably still the best goalkeeper at Real Madrid at the moment. Areola chose the right way and stretched well but could not stop Machis scoring from the spot.\n\n'He made a mistake, but he put in a big performance,' Zidane said defending his second keeper four days after defending his first choice.\n\nDarwin Machis scored from the penalty spot for Granada's first goal of the match\n\nWhen impressive defender Domingos Duarte turned the second in from a corner it looked as if Granada's 1,000 travelling fans might have a point to celebrate but Zidane played another card from his pack of expensive substitutes and he got the goal that finally killed off Granada.\n\nIt was a fine move from one end of the pitch to the other with Odriozola and Benzema involved. Odriozola was clever with his pass and James was just as clever with a controlled finish beyond Rui Silva.\n\nHe ripped his shirt off as if it was the winner. He is still frustrated by a lack of minutes and may yet be a good signing for someone in January. It was not the winner. The whistle went almost immediately and Madrid would have won without the fourth but Granada had pushed them all the way.\n\n'You have suffer and sweat in all games. But I will always be positive, the players too, although we know we must improve, and we will,' promised Zidane.", "description": "'We need to see Eden like this, playing well, and scoring goals,' said Zidane.
