It is 12 weeks this Saturday. I am in prime physical condition. I have agreed the date with the company,\" McGregor said, adding that he knows his opponent's name but won't reveal it. \"If I was to give you people the name, which I would love to do, I know the UFC would flip it because they are a crafty company.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old McGregor hasn't fought since losing by submission to Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018. He was banned for six months and fined $50,000 for his part in a post-fight brawl.\n\nMcGregor said he is targeting two more fights, including a rematch with Nurmagomedov in Moscow. He also aimed a string of insults at the Russian fighter.\n\nAfter the Jan. 18 fight, McGregor said he would then like to fight the winner of the Nov. 3 bout between Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal, followed by either Nurmagomedov or Tony Ferguson.\n\n\"I'm going to go through the entire roster like a chain saw through butter,\" he said.\n\nMcGregor's return comes as he faces more legal issues. He is facing an assault charge in Ireland over an incident in which he appeared to punch a man in a bar.\n\nHe said he is planning to abstain from alcohol and late nights in the run-up to his next fight.\n\n\"I am focused here,\" McGregor said. \"I am structured now.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
