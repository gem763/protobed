It will also continue to produce its signature 1911s and revolvers.\n\nThe AR-15, and AR-15-style rifles, have been used in a number of mass shootings in recent years. While it's not clear if Colt was the specific manufacturer in the cases, the shooter in the Poway synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh killed 11 people with an AR-15.\n\nNikolas Cruz, who confessed to killing 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, 2018, used an AR-15-style gun.\n\nTwenty-six people were killed with the same type of rifle in a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in February 2017.\n\nDozens of rifles, including AR-15s, were found in the hotel room where Stephen Paddock allegedly killed the most people in a shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas in October 2017.\n\nGeorge Frey/Getty Images\n\nColt's Manufacturing Company opened in 1836 in Hartford, Connecticut, and is legendary for its Civil War-era revolvers, such as the Colt Walker, the Peacemaker and M1911.\n\nThe suspension of production already caught the eye of 2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, who recently called for a buy back of all assault-style weapons and said weapons of war had no place in the hands of civilians. O'Rourke mocked a photo posted on Twitter by the NRA saying he was increasing sales of AR-15s with a link to a story about Colt stopping production.\n\nSeveral stores have stopped selling assault rifles in recent years in the wake of shootings, including Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
