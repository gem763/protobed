While they are a slightly more visual format than sending off an email, and can be a useful way to convey information, sometimes they're just a little bit lacking when it comes to holding people's attention.\n\nFor those looking to make their slides more interactive or interesting, embedding a YouTube video can do the trick (provided, of course, that it makes sense within the larger context of the presentation).\n\nAnd luckily for those who use Google's suite of products, this is a feature that's built into Google Slides, making it an easy and quick way to spice up those boring slideshows.\n\nHere's what you'll need to know to do it.\n\nHow to embed a YouTube Video in Google Slides\n\nBefore getting started, you'll want to grab a copy of the YouTube video URL you want to use.\n\nAnd keep in mind that slideshows with multiple slides work a little differently \u2014 after completing step one, you'll have to select the proper slide in the left sidebar to ensure the video is uploaded onto the proper one.\n\nWith that in mind, here's how to embed a YouTube video onto your slide:\n\n1. Go to slides.google.com and either create a new slideshow or go into the one whereyou want to embed the YouTube video.\n\n2.

In order to avoid warping the video by making it too wide or narrow, for example, stick to using the corner boxes when resizing.\n\nTo reposition it, click and drag the video to any part of the slide. You should see the cursor turn into a four-sided arrow when you hover over the video.\n\nAs you drag the video to its new position, red guide lines will appear on the slide to help you center it perfectly within the slide.\n\nRelated coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech:", "description": "It's easy to embed a YouTube video in Google Slides to make for a better presentation.
