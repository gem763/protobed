If you did, chances are it still felt tricky to know exactly what was in your food: how do you decide between a can of soup that has \u201creduced sodium\u201d and one that\u2019s labelled \u201clow sodium\u201d \u2013 and what\u2019s the difference?\n\nIndeed, our latest research shows that many shoppers find food labels confusing and this is actually leading to a lot of people not really understanding what they\u2019re eating.\n\nSo while most people are aware a healthy diet involves eating a variety of nutrients in differing quantities, it\u2019s less well known what these nutrients should be, and how much a person should be consuming.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nResearch from 2018 shows that half of all the food bought by families in the UK is now \u201cultra-processed\u201d. So rather than fresh home-cooked meals, a lot of us are eating food made in factories with industrial ingredients and additives \u2013 that bear little resemblance to food in its natural state.\n\nEmpowering people to make good decisions at mealtimes starts with shoppers knowing what\u2019s in the food they\u2019re buying.\n\nAnd food labels play a role in this \u2013 but manufacturers need to present this information in clear and easy to understand formats to be useful \u2013 as most people don\u2019t have hours to mull over the ingredients of a ready meal.\n\nIn the UK, the Food Standards Agency regulates the use of food wording and claims \u2013 such as \u201chigh in fibre\u201d or \u201clow in salt\u201d. For a cereal to be classed as high in fibre, for example, it needs to have about 30 per cent of the recommended daily fibre intake.\n\nFood manufacturers and supermarkets have made attempts to simplify complex nutritional information. But as our research shows, many people still find food labels confusing \u2013 and tend to overestimate how much fibre a \u201chigh fibre\u201d food actually provides. People in our study also overestimated how much fat a label like \u201clow fat\u201d might refer to \u2013 though to a lesser extent.\n\nLack of consistency\n\nThis confusion around what labels mean may stem from the fact that categorisation guidelines differ from nutrient to nutrient \u2013 demonstrating the complexities of nutrition science.\n\nSome guidance is available on how label categories should be understood, but the rules are complicated and hard to remember. Combine this with the multitude of choices that confront shoppers in supermarkets, and it\u2019s easy to see why so many people struggle to fully grasp what the labels are saying.\n\nAnother issue is that there isn\u2019t a consistent system for food labelling in the UK. Shoppers have to compare across words and numbers to make a food choice \u2013 how do you quickly choose between a \u201clow fat\u201d cereal and one with \u201c5 per cent of your recommended daily allowance of fat\u201d? Comparing different nutrients on the same box is also a problem.\n\nHealthy eating is not just about reducing consumption, but also getting sufficient nutrition. It\u2019s already known that most people in the UK do not get enough fibre in their diet \u2013 and believing foods offer more fibre than they do could be a contributing factor.\n\nAnd although overestimating quantities of fat may seem like a good thing if it reduces consumption, research shows that a \u201clow fat\u201d label can, for some people, seem like a licence to eat more. Ultimately, there are many ways food labels can lead shoppers astray.\n\nFood for thought\n\nStandardising the way nutrition is communicated across all packaged foods would help. And mandating a \u201ctraffic light\u201d format on all products would eliminate the need to compare one item with words and another with numbers.\n\nThe other challenge is what numbers should be attached to words like \u201clow\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d. The current traffic light labelling system counts how many grams of nutrients are in the food, but claims like \u201chigh protein\u201d, counts the percentage of protein. A better system would be to translate words into a food\u2019s percentage contribution to their recommended daily allowance (RDA). This could help to reduce confusion since RDA percentages are consistent for different nutrients, and people understand the percentage of RDA more easily than absolute amounts.\n\nEffective legislation for food labels is a challenge because it needs to balance the complexity of nutrition science with the psychology of communicating information. Current guidelines have made great strides in simplifying and distilling this information. And the next step is to harness the psychology of how people interpret information \u2013 so that what\u2019s on food packets actually make sense to shoppers in the supermarket.\n\nDawn Liu\u200b is a lecturer in the department of psychology at the University of Essex.
