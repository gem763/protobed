I think at my age you can\u2019t really be demanding where you want to bat for England in that top order.\n\n\u201cBut Rory is good fun. He\u2019s a pretty relaxed guy \u2013 not a lot fazes him. I\u2019m pretty chilled as well so it seems to work quite well.\u201d\n\nThree half centuries in the final three Tests of the Ashes provided evidence of the huge strides taken by Denly since his debut against the West Indies at the turn of the year.\n\nA hundred in his final innings of a series would have capped off his summer perfectly.\n\n\u201cI was gutted (to be dismissed for 94),\u201d says Denly. \u201cLooking back now I\u2019m very proud to have got England in a position to win that match and having worked very hard for every single one of those runs.\n\n\u201cLooking back, though, to miss out on scoring your first international hundred in an Ashes series I\u2019m disappointed. That would have been dream come true stuff.\n\n\u201cI had a bit of luck, Tim Paine and Mitch Marsh didn\u2019t review an LBW when I was on 50 odd and I was dropped on nought as well. I would probably have taken 94 had you asked me before hand.\n\n\u201cIt was an incredible series to be a part of. To be involved in such a compelling series was pretty cool. It ebbed and flowed and we had our opportunities in most games to win the Test match but unfortunately we got ourselves and then weren\u2019t able to capitalise on those positions.\n\n\u201cMore often than not it was one man \u2013 Mr Steve Smith \u2013 who managed to drag the momentum back for the Australians. We just couldn\u2019t find a way of getting him out. I go back to the first game at Edgbaston. We were in such a good position \u2013 bowling first and getting them 112 for 8. We were flying and then (Peter) Siddle came in and blocked up an end and Steve Smith just continued on his merry way on a wicket that was spinning and deteriorating after day one.\n\n\u201cThat proved to be a match winning innings In the first Test match of the summer it\u2019s always important to get your noses ahead. It was pretty tough going from then on in.\u201d\n\nSmith eventually finishing the series with a monumental 774 runs from just seven innings \u2013 a tally that ultimately proved the difference between the two teams. Denly, meanwhile, scored 312 runs at an average of 31. Given the struggles of batsmen on both sides, it was a more than respectable tally.\n\nAnd one that more than made up for missing the cut for England\u2019s World Cup squad, a decision he believes set him up perfectly for what was to follow.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change the way my summer has gone,\u201d he says. \u201cThe World Cup was incredible for English cricket. But not being involved gave me a great opportunity to go back and score some red ball runs for Kent and put myself in a great place for the Ashes series.\n\n\u201cEvery English and Australian cricketer dreams of being a part of that growing up.\u201d\n\nAfter his late entry to Test cricket, Denly is determined to ensure that a summer to remember is a springboard to long-term success.", "description": "This time last year Joe Denly was preparing for a winter on the modern Twenty20 merry-go-round.
