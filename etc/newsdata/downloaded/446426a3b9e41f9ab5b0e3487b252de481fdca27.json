(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nPrompted partly by the success in luring Amazon, 10 Northern Virginia jurisdictions have formed an alliance to market themselves as a region to attract other companies, especially those in the high-tech arena.\n\nInstead of trying to poach businesses from each other, or promote themselves at their neighbors\u2019 expense, they will compete mainly as a group against other major metropolitan areas such as Boston and Silicon Valley to lure companies from outside the Washington area.\n\nThe new Northern Virginia Economic Development Alliance, or NOVA EDA, was to be formally announced Monday morning. It will include Fairfax, Arlington, Loudoun, Prince William and Fauquier counties, and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas and Manassas Park.\n\nOfficials said the collaboration will strengthen Northern Virginia\u2019s appeal to potential investors at a time when the area has attracted international interest because of Amazon\u2019s high-profile decision to build its second headquarters, with 25,000 high-paying jobs, in Arlington\u2019s Crystal City.\n\n[Here\u2019s how Virginia officials found out Arlington won half of Amazon HQ2.]\n\nAlthough a memorandum of understanding signed by the 10 jurisdictions still allows them to act individually \u2014 and potentially compete as in the past \u2014 officials said they see numerous benefits in cooperating.\n\n\u201cLook at how successful this region has been in its own fractured way,\u201d said Christopher Bruno, economic development director for Fairfax City. \u201cImagine how successful it can be now that we\u2019re all pulling in the same direction.\u201d\n\nThe move also appeared likely to add to Northern Virginia\u2019s economic advantages over the District and the Maryland suburbs. Even before the Amazon decision in November, Northern Virginia accounted for well over half of the new jobs created in the Washington metropolitan area. That\u2019s due to a mix of factors, including a lower corporate tax rate, weaker labor unions and better access to airports.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether the initiative would help or set back efforts by organizations such as the 2030 Group and Greater Washington Partnership to forge a regional identity that bridges the Potomac to unite Northern Virginia with the District and suburban Maryland.\n\nThe new alliance\u2019s members will be the top economic development officers of each jurisdiction. They will develop and market a regional brand, and unite for trips to business conferences and visits with corporate decision-makers.\n\nThe alliance also will deal with the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, the state authority tasked with luring businesses to the commonwealth. The partnership has been urging the Northern Virginia jurisdictions to form a regional group similar to 16 others in the state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always at the same site selection shows and marketing to the same people,\u201d said Christina Winn, executive director of the Prince William County Department of Economic Development. \u201cIf we\u2019re doing that with one collective voice, that is going to be heard loud and clear.\u201d\n\n[Maryland\u2019s Amazon loss prompts questions about its competitiveness.]\n\nThe 14-month effort to land Amazon HQ2 led directly to creation of the alliance. Four Northern Virginia jurisdictions \u2014 Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun counties and the city of Alexandria \u2014 combined on a bid offering four separate sites.\n\nIt quickly became clear that the online retail giant welcomed the regional approach. That was partly because the company was evaluating not just individual jurisdictions but entire metropolitan regions regarding workforce, transportation and lifestyle.\n\n(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\u201cAmazon has point-blank said one of the strongest pieces of our proposal was our collaboration,\u201d said Stephanie Landrum, president of the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership.\n\nShe said it will be easier to market Alexandria as part of a larger region.\n\n\u201cIn the past, I would pitch to a company and say, \u2018You can open your office here and have a beautiful townhouse in Old Town.\u2019 Now I can say, \u2018You can open your office in Old Town, and your employees can have a cool horse farm in Fauquier,\u2019 \u201d Landrum said.\n\n\u201cFor the first 10 years of my career, we pitched Northern Virginia as a suburb of D.C.,\u201d she continued. \u201cOver the last two years, Northern Virginia is really emerging as its own identifiable brand. Obviously, Amazon really helped us do that.\u201d\n\nVictor Hoskins, president of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, said the change was necessary to compete effectively against national rivals.\n\n\u201cIf you go in and all of your little jurisdictions are fighting for attention, and Silicon Valley is competing as one valley, and Boston-Cambridge is competing as one market, you look like you\u2019re very tiny,\u201d Hoskins said. \u201cWe have to take advantage of the entire [regional] workforce, the entire portfolio of housing, the entire transportation system.\u201d\n\nHoskins recently moved to the Fairfax job from the top job in Arlington, where he was in charge during the Amazon effort. Winn, now at Prince William, also recently changed jobs after playing a leading role in Arlington on the Amazon project.\n\n[After helping Arlington land Amazon, Victor Hoskins to become Fairfax County\u2019s economic development chief.]\n\nIn the past, many political leaders have resisted regional cooperation because they wanted hometown wins for their own jurisdictions that they could trumpet to voters during campaigns. But minds changed after collaboration worked with the Amazon bid and in winning dedicated funding for Metro.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like a political door opened for us,\u201d Hoskins said. \u201cThe electeds said, \u2018Hey, we should be doing this. This is how we should work.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA long-term question for the Washington region is whether the Northern Virginia agreement could eventually be expanded to include the District and suburban Maryland.\n\nDespite progress toward regionwide cooperation, there\u2019s a long history of competition among the two states and the District.\n\nHoskins portrayed the Northern Virginia alliance as a first step toward a broader project.\n\n\u201cEventually, we\u2019ll all come together as one region,\u201d Hoskins said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re trending. But right now, it\u2019s pretty cool to have us 10 working together in Northern Virginia.\u201d", "description": "Amazon HQ2 success prompts 10 jurisdictions to set aside past competition and work together to sell the region.", "authors": ["Robert Mccartney", "Senior Regional Correspondent Covering Government", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YGgkq_Ne_pfmpaxY9n-nUWXnOEE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ENOOUSENMYI6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
