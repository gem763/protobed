That means Joe Root will not play in Yorkshire, something he described as a 'little bit strange'.\n\nThe England captain will instead play for Nottinghamshire-based Trent Rockets.\n\nJonny Bairstow and Rory Burns will play for Cardiff-based Welsh Fire and the Lord's team London Spirit respectively.\n\nEngland all-rounder Chris Woakes insisted the kits were 'quirky' and fitted the competition\n\nEach team has now picked three players - one contracted player and two 'local icons'. The main draft takes place on October 20.\n\nChris Woakes, who will play for Birmingham Phoenix, sounded confident that The Hundred would be popular, but conceded that players' reputations were at stake.\n\nOn the kit, he said: 'The quirkiness of the kit kind of goes with the tournament I suppose.'\n\nThe women's franchises each picked two centrally contracted players, with England captain Heather Knight drafted to London Spirit. All-rounder Nat Sciver will play for Trent Rockets.", "description": "The governing body's attempts to appeal to a new audience were made clear by their choice of an east London warehouse as the venue to launch their controversial format.", "authors": ["Laura Lambert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/00/19276608-0-image-a-18_1570145163371.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
