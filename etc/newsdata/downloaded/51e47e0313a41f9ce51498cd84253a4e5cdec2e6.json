In order to steal it, thieves slide under the car and use high-powered cutting tools to detach the box from the pipes around it.\n\nAlthough there are 10,000 different types of converters, the cars that are most often targeted are hybrid vehicles.\n\nSince hybrid cars have two power sources - electric and petrol or diesel - the catalytic converter is used less frequently to process pollutants. The metals are less likely to corrode, meaning they are worth more and thus attractive to thieves.\n\nPrecious metals must be used because the converters have to work efficiently enough to meet emissions standards.\n\nWhat can we do about it?\n\nThe police has advised that vehicle owners consider taking the following safety measures:\n\nMark catalytic converters with a serial number to make it distinctive\n\nPlace a protective covering over the catalytic converter\n\nInstall CCTV and alarms\n\nPark vehicles so as to prevent access underneath\n\nCarmaker Toyota is very concerned about the thefts, and says it is \"doing all [it] can\" to support its customers who have been victims of crime.\n\nBesides consulting with the police and offering customers safety tips, Toyota has developed \"Catloc\", a device which makes it harder for thieves to detach the catalytic converter from the bottom of the car.\n\n\"Although 'cat theft' is not new, or limited to Toyota products, it has always been comparatively rare; however, the recent rise in the value of such parts for recycling has meant that police forces have seen a very significant rise in these offences in the last few months,\" said a Toyota spokesman.\n\nToyota does not make money when replacing stolen catalytic converters in cars, and it is also bearing the cost to discount the Catloc device for its customers, while it researches more anti-theft technologies, the BBC understands.\n\nHonda has a different take on the matter - it says that Honda Accord and Jazz models from 2008 onwards come with a tray under the car to make it harder for thieves to get at the catalytic converter.\n\nAnd in car models from 2015 onwards, the catalytic converter has been placed within the engine bay, so a thief would need to disassemble the car to get at it.\n\nCracking down on scrap metal yards\n\nDafydd Dylan, commercial manager of the catalytic converters division at FJ Church and Sons, told the BBC that his firm is constantly receiving calls from members of the public asking how much they could get if they were to sell catalytic converters from car models such as Totoya Prius, Honda Accord and Honda Jazz.\n\n\"We do what we can to discourage it - we don't purchase any units from these models unless they come from a reputable dealer,\" he said.\n\nHe added that there were also ways to tell if suppliers were trying to sell stolen goods: \"When we get a packet, usually there will be a range of low-end and high-end catalytic converters in it.\n\n\"We have refused to work with some suppliers for certain packets containing a disproportionate amount of high-grade scrap converters.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Toyota says it is trying to support its customers while consulting with the police to improve anti-theft measures\n\nHowever, although it has been illegal to pay cash for scrap metal since 2013, he says there are some dealers who will pay cash for catalytic converters, which tempts the thieves.\n\n\"The police needs to start to put people in jail for paying cash for scrap metal - as soon as they do that, the trade would slow down and stop,\" he said.\n\nThe British Metals Recycling Association agrees: \"It is unlikely that any stolen catalytic converters will enter a BMRA member yard due to 'know your customer' checks.\n\n\"However, there will be yards that operate illegally, willingly take stolen material and pay cash for it. There will also be no record of the transaction. This is due to the lack of enforcement of the Scrap Metals Dealers Act 2013 and its complementary legislation in Scotland, The Air Weapons Licensing Act 2015.\"", "description": "The Met Police says catalytic converter thefts almost doubled due to precious metal prices rising.", "authors": ["Mary-Ann Russon", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/142D8/production/_108884628_catalytic-converter1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
