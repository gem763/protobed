However, it brought with it a level of risk in politics, where it can influence votes and in turn people's lives.\n\n\"Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimisation of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes.\n\n\"All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"These challenges will affect ALL internet communication, not just political ads. Best to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings. Trying to fix both means fixing neither well, and harms our credibility.\"\n\nThe Twitter boss said the platform considered banning just ads for candidates. However, ads related to issues would have been a way around that.\n\nThe new policy, which will come into effect on November 22, will include excemptions for issues like registering to vote.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t about free expression,\"Dorsey said.\n\n\"This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address,\" Mr Dorsey tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Bloomberg\n\nHis comments come amid building pressure con Facebook over political advertising. Earlier this week, The New York Times reported an open letter from Facebook employees urging Zuckerberg and his executive team to rethink the platform's policy on political advertising.\n\nThe Facebook chief executive has come under fire for his stance of not policing claims made in political advertising.\n\n\"We are proud to work here,\" the letter started.\n\n\"Facebook stands for people expressing their voice. Creating a place where we can debate, share different opinions, and express our views is what makes our app and technologies meaningful for people all over the world.\"\n\nThe letter said free speech was not the same as paid speech.\n\n\"Misinformation affects us all. Our current policies on fact-checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for,\" it said.\n\n\"We strongly object to this policy as it stands. It doesn\u2019t protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponise our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\"", "description": "Jack Dorsey has banned all paid political advertising on the social media platform, attributing the move to the credibility risks that comes with the spread of fake news, doctored videos known as deep fakes and intrusive micro-targeting of users.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0499%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_951%2C$y_81/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/80ca4991e6219b14582fc0d0739f54dd35cdcd8c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
