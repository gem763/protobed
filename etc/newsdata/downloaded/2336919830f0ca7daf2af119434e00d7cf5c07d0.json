It was established in Mesopotamia around 4,300 years ago after its ruler, Sargon of Akkad, united a series of independent city states. Akkadian influence spanned along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers from what is now southern Iraq, through to Syria and Turkey. The Akkad empire during the reign of Nar\u00e2m-S\u00een (2254-2218 BC) The north-south extent of the empire meant that it covered regions with different climates, ranging from fertile lands in the north which were highly dependent on rainfall (one of Asia's 'bread baskets'), to the irrigation-fed alluvial plains to the south.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Geologists led from Japan's Hokkaido University reconstructed what the climate would have been like at the heart of the Akkadian Empire: the city of Tell Leilan, in modern-day Syria.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/11/20321440-0-image-a-2_1572347719797.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
