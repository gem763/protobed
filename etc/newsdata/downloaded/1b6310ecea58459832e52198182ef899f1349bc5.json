I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI carried out the policy of the United States in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Biden called for the firing of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, who was seen by the Obama administration, western governments and organizations like the International Monetary Fund as not aggressively investigating corruption. Trump and his allies have alleged without evidence that Biden intervened to support his son\u2019s business interests.\n\nCooper notably framed the Hunter Biden question by stating outright that Trump has \u201cfalsely accused\u201d Biden\u2019s son of \u201cdoing something wrong while serving on a company board if Ukraine\u201d and noted \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.\u201d\n\nSome prominent Republicans, including the president\u2019s son, blasted Cooper\u2019s handling of the question about the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cAnderson Cooper is the DNC\u2019s MVP so far for the night covering for #QuidProJoe even when Hunter Biden said they talked about it,\u201d tweeted Donald Trump Jr. \u201cWould be nice if they called out the BS once in a while.\u201d\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee suggested Cooper \u201cloved Biden\u201d and \u201chated\u201d Trump. \u201cWhat a joke,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham said in mocking Cooper\u2019s question.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Hunter Biden acknowledged exercising \u201cpoor judgment\" in joining foreign companies while his father was in office, yet rejected the claims of his accusers.\n\n\"I regret not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea, which has again been completely debunked by everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Washington Examiner\u2019s Tim Carney wrote that accusations from Trump \u201care based on conspiracy theories,\u201d but argued that Hunter Biden accepting $50,000 a month from Ukraine\u2019s Burisma Holdings while his father was vice president is \u201ccorrupt.\u201d He suggested Cooper \u201cask the other candidates, particularly the ones talking about inequality, if they agree with his assessment that Hunter did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nCooper didn\u2019t dwell on the Hunter Biden angle \u2014 and neither did Joe Biden\u2019s rivals.\n\nThe next candidate called on, Sen. Bernie Sanders, shifted the focus to issues he\u2019s concerned about, such as the millions of uninsured Americans and climate change. Later, Sen. Cory Booker revisited the Hunter Biden question in suggesting it was a reminder of problematic 2016 election coverage.\n\n\u201cWe are literally using Donald Trump's lies and the second issue we cover is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive,\u201d said Booker. \u201cThe only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing we are distracting from his malfeasance and selling out of his office. I'm having deja vu all over again.\n\nPhilippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, tweeted that Booker was \u201c10000% right\u201d and that Cooper\u2019s \u201cquestion to Joe Biden about ethics charges is exactly why trump makes shit up out of thin air.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media is so worried about being called liberal they go overboard proving they\u2019re not,\u201d Reines continued. \u201cIn doing so, they are not being journalists.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bf/97/05b7f3f842c68f1a87642b6301af/20191015-anderson-cooper-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
