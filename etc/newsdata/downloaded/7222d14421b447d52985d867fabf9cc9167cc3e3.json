That was up from 70% in a survey in 2018, and 63% in a 2017 survey.\n\nThe most common attacks were phishing and social engineering scams, cited by 57% of companies. These are invasions that target unsuspecting computer, smartphone and tablet users with realistic-looking emails; if a user clicks on a link or attachment in the email, malicious software is downloaded onto the device. Forty-four percent of companies reported an attack that came via a website.\n\nWhile businesses of all sizes are victims of cyberattacks, the smaller the companies, the more vulnerable they can be. They don\u2019t have large information technology staffs and many don\u2019t have expensive, sophisticated software designed to monitor their systems and defend against attacks.\n\nLack of personnel and not enough money were the top two challenges keeping companies from having a fully effective information technology program. Seventy-seven percent of companies said they didn\u2019t have enough staffers, up from 72% a year ago. And 55% said money was a problem, down from 58% a year ago, but still a reflection that a considerable number of companies struggle to meet their cybersecurity needs.\n\nCompanies are most concerned about protecting their customer records; 62% cited it as a priority. That was followed by intellectual property, cited by 48%, customer credit and debit card information, cited by 43% and financial information, cited by 30%.\n\nSmall and mid-sized company owners have embraced mobile devices as a way to run their businesses. But they recognize that the convenience and efficiency these devices off come at a price; half said the devices have diminished the cybersecurity of their companies.", "description": "Small businesses struggle to devote resources to protect their technology from attacks.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HE799_cyber__ZG_20190228110952.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
