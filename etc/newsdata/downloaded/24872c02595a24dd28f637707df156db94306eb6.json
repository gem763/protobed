In 2016, she told Vogue that she had given up Marlboro cigarettes, cut back on her alcohol intake and changed up her diet. She did it to protect her voice and build up stamina for her tour and, as a result, \u201clost a bit of weight,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I fit into normal, off-the-shelf clothes.\u201d\n\nThis past May, one month after officially separating from Konecki, with whom she shares a son, she wrote in a birthday post that, after a really trying 30th year, she was putting an emphasis on self-love and care. She wrote that 31 was \u201cgoing to be a big ol\u2019 year and I\u2019m going to spend it all on myself.\u201d\n\nThat self-care has been doing the body good. A month later, Adele got people talking about her stunning new look \u2014 and further weight loss \u2014 after posting a series of photos of herself at a Spice Girls concert.\n\nSoon after, there was a report that she had taken up pilates, using a reformer machine.
