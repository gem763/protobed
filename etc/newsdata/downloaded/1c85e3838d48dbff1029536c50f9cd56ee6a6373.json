Michael Corbett\n\nThe fiord is hugely tidal, falling nearly two metres in just a couple of hours, as it has begun to do as we push off again. And as the tide falls, the bears suddenly emerge. We are passing between two islands. Someone has just thought to ask if the bears can swim out this far, when the vertical garden of brush on one side begins to stir, and a great fat mother sow and her cub suddenly break cover, huge on the tiny island like cockatoos on a stump.\n\nInstantly we stop about 60 metres or so away, watching them as they devour the hill. \u201cShe\u2019s probably taken refuge from a boar bear,\u201d says our guide, Jack, a young Englishman who now lives in Anchorage. \u201cIt\u2019s the mating season. She could have taken off and found this island to protect her cub.\u201d That theory is borne out as we finally move on, and suddenly spot another huge sow on a slightly larger island nearby, pacing the water\u2019s edge.\n\nAt first it seems she might be fishing, until the greenery behind her begins to move, and she suddenly takes off, cantering \u2013 at a surprising clip given her size \u2013 the length of the island, before launching herself into the water as the island runs out. As she paddles away, only her great handsome head is visible.\n\nGeographic Harbor has the highest concentration of brown bears in the world. Margot Sib\n\nNow it\u2019s the boar\u2019s turn to pace the shore as he watches her emerge on an island a few hundred metres away and disappear into the green. At which point he decides to follow suit and take a swim, right in the middle of our Zodiacs.\n\nFor more than an hour, these shy creatures frolic around the foreshore, playing out this bedroom farce in full view. It is, in every sense, the money shot; the one we could neither have expected nor imagined, and the polar opposite, pardon the pun, of the lolling, fish-swatting shots for which Katmai is famous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe moment encapsulates everything about our 15-day cruise along Alaska\u2019s 2000-kilometre Aleutian archipelago, the chain of volcanic islands between Russia and the United States that separate the Bering Sea from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAt a time when more and more ships are reaching more and more places, the Aleutians are an exercise is remoteness.\n\nAlaska\u2019s Aleutians are a relatively new cruise destination. Ponant, the French line that started in Brittany 30 years ago and is in the midst of a major global expansion, particularly in Australia (now its second-biggest market) has only recently begun sailing to the region.\n\nYou can see the allure. At a time when more and more ships are reaching more and more places, the Aleutians are an exercise is remoteness. We board in Petropavlovsk-Kamtchatsky in Russia\u2019s far east \u2013 4000 kilometres, or a day\u2019s flight, from Moscow. Even the few hours we spend in transit are pure Russian performance art: from the immigration shack, with its busted venetian blinds and pale, dour officers, to the startlingly new, curiously moving Trinity Cathedral, with its gold onion domes, ancient, freshly painted icons and gut-wrenching, piped choir.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church of the Holy Ascension in Dutch Harbor.\n\nIn the eight days that have since elapsed we have crossed worlds, eras \u2013 sometimes, it seems, dimensions \u2013 from the lush, dark, windswept islands of Attu, Kiska, Davidof and Adak to the pristine town of Dutch Harbor, with its clapboard, shoreline church, bald eagles arguing noisily on its onion domes and perched on every second street light.\n\nWe hike for four hours across Adak, on a sprung floor of peat, the deserted landscape a luminous, lowering mix of the Scottish Highlands and New Zealand\u2019s Milford Sound. Attu and Kiska hold a similar resemblance and both have remnants of World War II (during which they were occupied by the Japanese), including gun turrets and bunkers.\n\nLater in the trip, on the island of Atka, we see a B-24 Liberator bomber that crash-landed there in 1942 and now rots elegantly in a field of green, as silvery and riveted as a Marc Newson piece.\n\n\"A luminous mix of the Scottish Highlands and Milford Sound\": hiking inland on Adak Island. Michael Corbett\n\nIt typifies the tenor of the Aleutians: haunted. After Geographic Harbor, we visit Unga Island and the ruined wooden village that was home to more than 300 people a century ago. It\u2019s an entirely other-worldly experience to walk along the green slopes, above small black coves, past bone-coloured buildings that have collapsed into drifts of palings, like piano keys. Then there\u2019s the wooden church on its buckled knees, spire still aloft, a tiny Arctic fox among the boards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is most striking about these ghostscapes, however, is the contrast with the life that otherwise teems at every turn. The area, the captain tells us on day one, is one of the richest in the world for birdlife; the flocks of terns and albatross around the ship and the tufted owls, puffins and colonies of kittywakes onshore are testament to this.\n\nThat\u2019s because it is also one of the greatest places on earth for sea life. The cold, nutrient-rich currents that flow across the Aleutian shelf are the marine equivalent of Geographic Harbor\u2019s bear larder. The ship too \u2013 as befits a French line \u2013 is the equivalent for its 200-odd passengers, particularly the silver-service restaurant from which you can watch the sea go by while dining on beautifully balanced four-course meals, with a particular emphasis on French classics.\n\nThe spire still stands on Unga Island\u2019s ruined church.\n\nBut Le Sol\u00e9al isn\u2019t just French, it\u2019s Breton, and one of the four original luxury expedition ships Ponant built before its recent expansion. And, as befits a company founded by sailors in a maritime realm, the company takes its seafaring \u2013 or navigation as it is constantly referred to \u2013 very seriously. It is the principle on which the ship operates; we might suddenly jettison the itinerary to chase a blue whale or duck into an inlet because the weather\u2019s good. The bridge remains open throughout, the captain and expedition crew constantly alerting passengers to birds, dolphins, sea lions and every kind of whale.\n\nAnd the sightings are constant. As we arrive in Geographic Harbor, we see a sow and her cub on a beach in the distance snacking on a whale carcass. A few nights earlier, the captain\u2019s party is postponed just before it\u2019s due to start after whales are spotted. Everyone emerges on deck in their finery, to find orca, humpback and sperm whales lolling around the ship, flocks of albatross and gulls circling their heads like blowflies.\n\nThe orcas\u2019 great sprays of water sound like a giant snorkel being cleared as they graze alongside their traditional enemies, the humpbacks. Even the crew, which includes a number of whale experts, are stunned by the concentration of not only individuals, but species, in one place and so close to the ship, as if we are just another, slightly larger blue whale.\n\nThe whales of Geographic Harbor put on a show.\n\nFor more than an hour, in the never-ending evening that is Alaska in summer, we watch these bathing beauties revolve around us, like sirens of the sea. Only when our eyes are so gorged that every wave has become another back about to break the surface do we finally go in, straightening our evening gear and chatting in an excited hum of French, English, German and Mandarin, to where the champagne has been cooling its heels for hours.\n\nThe writer was a guest of Ponant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a glance\n\nCruise Ponant\u2019s Magnificent Volcanoes of the Aleutian Islands 12-night cruise sails in July 2020. Fares start from $16,030 per person.\n\nGetting there From Australia, fly to Seoul then connect with the Ponant charter flight to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in Kamchatka Krai, Russia (inclusive in the cruise ticket price).\n\nA striking artwork by Marie-Andr\u00e9e C\u00f4t\u00e9 features in Le Sol\u00e9al\u2019s lobby.\n\nRead There are a number of good books on the remarkable World War II campaign in the Aleutians, from Brian Garfield\u2019s classic The Thousand-Mile War to Mark Obmascik\u2019s The Storm on Our Shores. Moby-Dick is recommended given you\u2019ll find you\u2019ll turn into Captain Ahab on this trip, then anything by Solzhenitsyn, Dostoevsky or Kafka to limber up for immigration at Petropavlovsk\u2011Kamtchatsky.\n\nMust pack The Aleutians are beautiful but damp and windy. Heavy weather gear is provided onboard, including gumboots and Arctic-standard raincoats, but bring plenty of sheddable layers, plus a lightweight wind/shower-proof jacket with a hood. As Le Sol\u00e9al is a French ship, you may feel most comfortable wearing smart casual in the evenings, especially in the silver-service restaurant.\n\nThe 68-page bumper Grand Journeys issue of Sophisticated Traveller is out on Friday, October 18 inside The Australian Financial Review.
