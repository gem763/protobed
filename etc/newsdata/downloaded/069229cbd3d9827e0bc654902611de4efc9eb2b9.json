Despite deep threats of impeachment over in the US, the S&P 500 index is still up over 18%, the Dow Jones 15.3% and the Nasdaq 20.56%,\u201d wrote Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets U.K., in a Tuesday research note.\n\nElsewhere, President Xi Jinping presided over a military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Xi said \u201cthere is no force that can shake the foundation of this great nation,\u201d in a speech commemorating Chinese Communist Party\u2019s rule.\n\nMeanwhile, a Hong Kong protester was reportedly shot in the chest with a live round, representing a possible major escalation in the conflict between China and the semiautonomous nation on Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, markets continue to pay attention developments related to President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry after the Wall Street Journal reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listened in on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a disclosure that ties the State Department more closely to the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nLooking ahead, a number of other Fed speakers are on deck Tuesday, including Fed Gov. Richard Clarida at 8:50 a.m. Eastern Time in Washington, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman are due to speak after 9 a.m. in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nOn the data front, closely followed reports on manufacturing are due, with the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s Manufacturing index coming at 10 a.m. and the purchasing managers\u2019 manufacturing index, or PMIs due at 9:45 a.m. A report on construction spending also will be released at 10 a.m.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +3.80% rose to 1.734%, compared with a Monday afternoon close at 1.675%.\n\nIn commodities markets, West Texas Intermediate crude-oil for November delivery CLX19, +1.26% gained 55 cents, or 1%, to $54.63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a day after a 3.3% drop for the commodity.\n\nGold for December delivery GCZ19, +0.14% picked up $2.50, or 0.2%, to reach $1,475.90 an ounce after finishing Monday\u2019s session at a two-month low.\n\nIn Asia, Chinese benchmarks were closed in observance of its 70th anniversary.
