The campaign has entered a final phase in which the leaders call for strategic voting.\n\nC\u2019EST MARDI \u2014 Welcome to POLITICO Pro Canada\u2019s morning newsletter. Alex is in Ottawa later this week to chat with party insiders about the campaign; reach out to say hello.

It found that 62 percent agreed with a statement saying immigrants \u201cstrengthen\u201d Canada through their hard work and talent and make society more diverse and interesting. However, 38 percent agreed with the statement that said immigrants are a \u201cburden on our country\u201d because they take jobs, housing and health care and are too different from people who live in Canada now.\n\n\u2014 The partisan gap was stark. While respondents showed no major differences between age group and region, one factor did reveal a major difference of opinion: whether a respondent supported a party on the left (Liberals, NDP, Greens) or a party on the right (Conservatives, People\u2019s Party). The pro-immigration statement got majority support from Liberal supporters (75 percent), NDP supporters (76 percent), the Greens (66 percent) and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (56 percent), only 46 percent of Conservatives agreed with the pro-immigration statement while 54 percent of Conservative respondents agreed with the statement calling immigrants a burden.\n\nThe deepest anti-immigrant sentiment came from supporters the new People\u2019s Party, which is hoping to make inroads in its first election and calling for a reduction in immigration levels. Just 23 percent of supporters of the People\u2019s Party sided with the pro-immigration statement, while 77 percent sided with the anti-immigration statement.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has not played to the anti-immigration right in this election. He\u2019s repeatedly expressed support for immigration and, in his party platform, even included a tribute to his mother\u2019s work with refugees.\n\nSPIN CYCLE ON USMCA \u2014 Donald Trump and his new North American trade deal came up repeatedly on the campaign trail Monday. It\u2019s all been prompted by the recent rise of the NDP, and that party\u2019s apparent willingness to consider supporting the Liberals in a coalition arrangement. Some NDPers are on the record as saying they want to reopen the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to obtain better conditions for workers. Our take: This debate is dripping in spin. The next Canadian Parliament will almost certainly have the same crushing majority in favor of ratifying USMCA as the last, where Liberals and Conservatives voted as a bloc in early procedural votes. Let\u2019s untangle it.\n\nThe NDP is now trying to downplay USMCA as a make-or-break issue that would determine whether it backs a Liberal government. It\u2019s not on the NDP\u2019s new list of six priorities for the next Parliament. A party spokeswoman told Alex the NDP does not actually want to reopen negotiations, but delay ratifying until U.S. House Democrats get better labor enforcement provisions. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told a news conference Monday: \u201cIf you vote New Democrat, we\u2019re going to work with those in the [United] States, the Democrats in the States, to make sure that this agreement does create a level playing field for Canadian workers.\u201d He accused Trudeau of a \u201cnonsensical\u201d rush to ratify.\n\n\u2014 Trudeau tries the Trump card. The Liberal leader appeared to suggest Monday that NDP wavering might plunge Canada back into trade negotiations with Trump \u2014 something few Canadians are keen on. At a campaign stop near the U.S. border in Windsor, Ont., Trudeau motioned across the river at Detroit and said Canada\u2019s economy is deeply connected to America\u2019s. He said auto workers in that region \u201care very worried that Jagmeet Singh wants to reopen NAFTA.\u201d Trudeau mentioned Trump several times: \u201cWe need to continue to have a strong government with a clear focus on standing up for Canadians. Standing up to Donald Trump. Standing up to the forces of populism and chaos around the world.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The reality. Both the Liberals and NDP have a nearly identical position on USMCA: Wait for Nancy Pelosi. Trudeau\u2019s team has repeatedly stated it\u2019s awaiting developments in the U.S. Congress before ratifying. Trudeau, who has met with the U.S. House speaker to discuss USMCA, spoke with her by phone just before the campaign launch. And, contrary to Singh\u2019s protestions, Trudeau hasn\u2019t actually rushed to ratify anything. He allowed some procedural votes on the agreement this spring, then let the implementation bill sit unpassed.\n\nThe latest in Washington: With Democrats and the White House negotiating amendments to the deal, U.S. labor groups are urging their Democratic allies to take their time. Democrats still have concerns. And the U.S. House has only a few dozen sitting days left this year, before primary campaigns heat up and the politics of passing USMCA get trickier.\n\nHORSE-RACE SNAPSHOT \u2014 Trudeau\u2019s Liberals are in severe political peril with the campaign in its final week. An aggregate of recent polling data shows Trudeau's party, which has been running neck-and-neck for weeks with Scheer's Conservatives, now trailing by two percentage points. \"I'd say the Liberals are the underdogs now,\" said David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data. \"The prospect of a Liberal government has declined a lot in a week.\"\n\n\u2014 Strategic voting: One of Trudeau\u2019s challenges now, Coletto said, is convincing progressives he might actually lose. Coletto's own polling illustrates that supporters of every progressive party still believe Trudeau's Liberals are likelier to win, meaning left-leaning voters see little risk in backing another party. Trudeau is now warning NDP supporters they could be in for a nasty surprise, like the last time the NDP gained seats in Parliament \u2014 Conservatives won and pulled Canada out of the Kyoto climate accord.\n\nSingh, meanwhile, is telling progressives they could get a sweeter scenario by backing him: a center-left Liberal government pushed to the left, as it needs NDP votes to stay in power. Singh appeared to backpedal from that message Monday, as the Conservatives tried casting that scenario as a nightmare.\n\nIn a message aimed at moderate voters, Scheer on Monday urged centrist Canadians to back him, and give him clear majority control of Parliament. Otherwise, he warned, a Liberal-NDP coalition will drive up spending and taxes.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau will pay any price to stay in power \u2014 and he\u2019ll use your money to pay for it,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cOnly a Conservative majority government can prevent a government with Justin Trudeau as the spokesman \u2014 but the NDP calling the shots.\u201d\n\n\u2014 An Ontario divisional court panel found that Premier Doug Ford broke the law in scraping the province\u2019s cap-and-trade system. Despite the ruling, supporters acknowledge the system is unlikely to come back. Globe and Mail.\n\n\u2014 Canadian unemployment is at a four-decade low, with the country adding 54,000 jobs in September, according to Statistics Canada. Liberals grasped onto the jobs numbers amid the run-up to the election and a murky economic outlook. Canadian Press.\n\n\u2014 The Chinese government voiced their stern disapproval to Ottawa over former Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s recent visit to Taiwan. Harper said his trip was personal in nature, helping to promote a book and consulting business. Globe and Mail.\n\n\u2014 WeChat is allowing Canadian election ads on its platform without setting up a digital ad registry, pitting the Chinese social media giant against federal election law. Conservative ads ran last week claiming a Liberal government would legalize \u201chard drugs.\u201d CBC News.\n\nC\u2019est tranquille.\n\nDid we miss an event?
