But Wexner had contracted with the office, and a person told her \u201cwe work for Wexner,\u201d when she tried to report the crime, Farmer told the Washington Post.\n\nShe also alleged that she was discouraged from leaving the house without the permission of Abigail Wexler, Leslie Wexler\u2019s wife. She was later picked up by her father at the Washington home.\n\nFarmer filed an affidavit detailing the allegations earlier this year as part of a lawsuit by another alleged victim of Epstein\u2019s.\n\nFarmer said Epstein also inappropriately touched her sister, Annie who was 16 at the time of the alleged attack on her sister, according to The Washington Post. It was not immediately clear whether Maria was under 16 at the time she was allegedly attacked.\n\nShe said she did not tell anyone about it at the time because she thought of Epstein as her sister\u2019s boss.\n\nA security officer who was involved with the Wexner family\u2019s security at the time denied the allegation about the security team, telling The Washington Post \u201cI don\u2019t even remember what happened, and I can tell you, if that had happened, I would have remembered it.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Franklin County sheriff\u2019s office told the Washington Post it had no record of Farmer's 1996 call. But, according to the office's retention policy, it does not retain records of a call like Farmer's for more than two years, the Washington Post reported.\n\nWexner accused Epstein of \u201cmisappropriating vast sums of money from me and my family\u201d earlier this year. Representatives of Wexner\u2019s L Brands have denied connections between the two men, the Washington Post reported.\n\nMaxwell could not be located for comment by The Washington Post.\n\nIf you are a sexual assault survivor you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or reach it online at hotline.rainn.org/online.", "description": "A woman allegedly attacked by Jeffrey Epstein said she holds Victoria\u2019s Secret billionaire Leslie Wexner \u201cresponsible for what happened to me\u201d because she was staying on a property monitored by Wexner and his wife and guarded by his security team,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/epstein_protest_07102019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
