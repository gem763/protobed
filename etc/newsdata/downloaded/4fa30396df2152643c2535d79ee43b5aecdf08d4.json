Would Kamala Harris get her mojo back after a summer slump? Would anything jolt the solidifying pecking order of Biden, Warren, and Bernie Sanders in the top tier \u2014 and then everyone else struggling far below?\n\nThe fallout from Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate \u2014 the first time all the top contenders met face-to-face on the same stage \u2014 probably won\u2019t be apparent right away. But the nearly three-hour marathon debate hosted by ABC and Univision produced plenty of grist to chew over.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhich is what six of POLITICO\u2019s 2020 campaign reporters just did. We asked them to share their takeaways.\n\n\n\nWhat surprised you?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: Joe Biden opened the night as the clear aggressor, helping him get out ahead of anticipated criticism from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over health care. Nobody landed a glove on him. But what surprised me most was how much Warren, who is nipping at Biden\u2019s heels and polling a lot higher than Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, skated and then kind of faded into the background.\n\nLaura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: Juli\u00e1n Castro went there on Biden\u2019s age, questioning whether the front-runner could remember what he\u2019d said moments before on health care. It was a risk and didn\u2019t seem to land. But Castro as an aggressor, I think, works for him. Democrats can play nice but only for so long as they get closer to Iowa.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3263/1155968404_6085827928001_6085823265001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nNatasha Korecki: Castro laying into Joe Biden repeatedly and at one point seeming to question Biden\u2019s mental awareness was one of the more tense exchanges of the night. When Castro asked Biden \u201care you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d it came across as over the top and a bit mean-spirited. While Castro\u2019s gone on the attack plenty in debates, that comment was uncharacteristic of him.\n\nHolly Otterbein: I was most surprised that Beto O\u2019Rourke, who had been left for dead in the primary, pulled off a good performance tonight. His answer about gun confiscation was especially passionate. But will that make any difference in polling? I don\u2019t know. It could perhaps help him fundraise, which he needs to do to stay in the race over the long haul \u2014 not at all a guarantee.\n\nDavid Siders: I think the prospect of a forceful contrast between Biden and Warren was over-hyped. But I was surprised that Warren was such a small factor in the debate. More moderate Democrats appear to have calculated that Sanders was the safer target on the left.\n\nAlex Thompson: I was surprised that there were fewer clashes between the candidates than in the past two debates. The candidates had more room to focus on their own messages rather than on opponents\u2019. But without the drama of conflict and a nearly three-hour run time, were as many people paying attention and will it change the dynamic of the race?\n\n\n\n\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/25/a1/ce1dee70451ab229deac77900923/compilation.png\"\n\nWho had the worst night? Who had the best?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: Castro swung at Biden\u2014and mostly missed. He accused the former vice president of forgetting what he said two minutes before. The problem? Castro was wrong, and Biden was right. It\u2019s one thing to take on the front-runner over his advanced age and be right. But the fact-checks and post-scripts will show Castro blew it. Warren didn\u2019t mix it up with Biden, or anyone else. After appearing in two JV debates, she didn\u2019t prove tonight that she could go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump. Biden survived the night, though he seemed to get weaker as it went on. Beto O\u2019Rourke had some surprisingly strong moments.\n\nLaura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar did not have any moment that made them stand out. And when you\u2019re one of the second-tier candidates you need to find moments to shine. Beto O\u2019Rourke had multiple strong, cutting answers, and set a sharp contrast, which he\u2019s failed to do in the past \u2014 making this a great night for him. Joe Biden\u2019s performance, though rambling, was the best he\u2019s given out of the three debates. He was more energized.\n\nNatasha Korecki: I wouldn\u2019t say Biden had the best performance but it\u2019s the highest energy debate he\u2019s had to date. He was again the punching bag but handled the punches more deftly than he has in the past and even went on the offensive a bit with Sanders and Warren. O\u2019Rourke had probably the most powerful response of the night with his \u201cHell, yes we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-57.\u201d I don\u2019t know that anyone really bombed, but Sanders looked a bit haggard and his voice was raspy to the point that it was distracting for the early part of the night, though he improved as the debate wore on.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2561/1155968404_6085821670001_6085821761001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nHolly Otterbein: It was far from perfect, but tonight was Biden\u2019s best debate this year. Even more critically, Biden kept Warren from walking offstage with the \u201cWarren crushes Biden\u201d storyline that some anticipated. Going into the debates, I said I was looking to see if Sanders took the fight to Biden after not memorably challenging him in the first debate. Sanders contrasted himself with him a tad more strongly on issues like trade and the Iraq war, but he still wasn\u2019t all that aggressive.\n\nDavid Siders: If debates are, in part, expectations games, Warren had the worst night and O\u2019Rourke had the best. I doubt it will damage her, but Warren was getting her first shot at Biden and largely passed. I don\u2019t know if the debate will help O\u2019Rourke climb back into the top tier of contenders. But after two mediocre performances, he turned in an even, resonant debate. \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47\u201d was one of the most well-received lines of the night.\n\nAlex Thompson: Biden walked onstage the dominant front=runner and he almost certainly walked offstage the dominant front-runner. I think he had the best night. I don't necessarily think anyone had a bad night but relative to the other candidates, Buttigieg had the worst. After his meteoric rise last spring, his campaign message and vision has been a bit ambiguous and he did little to further define it tonight.\n\n\n\nDid you learn anything new?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: Unfortunately, not particularly. Klobuchar and Buttigieg, the Midwestern candidates, still appear risk-verse and unwilling to confront anyone. Harris showed another side of herself, but came off better in the first debate when she took the fight to Biden like she says she would Trump. Warren is still refusing to acknowledge middle-class tax increases as part of Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan she supports.\n\nLaura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: Nothing significant. But what struck me was the lack of direct attacks. There was no moment similar to the first debate when Harris targeted Biden on segregation. Biden lightly jabbed Warren over how she\u2019d pay for Medicare for All.\n\nNatasha Korecki: Biden has still somehow not come up with a good answer for deportations under the Obama administration, even though he\u2019s had plenty of time to mull over his answer. It once again became a moment on the debate stage.\n\nHolly Otterbein: Sanders tried on a different electability argument. He often points out on the campaign trail that he beats Trump in head-to-head polls. Tonight he noted that he won elections in Vermont despite facing long odds (and losing) in his early days as a politician.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/84/d6/2efcd018488697909c78e429de12/healthcare-rebuttal.png\"\n\nDavid Siders: Everyone on stage knows electability is the issue dominating the minds of Democratic voters, but the candidates are still searching for ways to make a salient case. It\u2019s easy in a campaign ad \u2014 put up a polling chart. It\u2019s harder when answering questions about issues in a debate.\n\nAlex Thompson: We learned that the health care debate isn\u2019t going anywhere. We are going to keep hearing about Medicare for All, Medicare for America, Medicare for All Who Want It, and the various other proposals. There are clear dividing lines \u2014 raising taxes, true universal coverage, out of pocket costs, and eliminating private insurance \u2014 between the candidates and health care is consistently one of the most important issues with voters. There wasn\u2019t much middle ground found tonight and so the debate will continue.\n\n\n\nHow did the moderators do?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: No big issues with the moderators, other than the uneven distribution of difficult questions. The health care portion of the debate seems always to be a setup for the progressives to fight the moderates \u2014 a formula that other networks have used this cycle \u2014 but one that\u2019s getting old.\n\nLaura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: The moderators did an effective job of asking direct questions that clearly challenged the candidates and at times made them uncomfortable. One criticism ABC received on Twitter from a number of reporters of color was the apparent decision to have the moderators of color ask all the questions about race and immigration.\n\nNatasha Korecki: The moderators kept the debate on track. At times it felt like the first true debate of the Democratic primary. But it went too long and the answers grew more meandering and less focused.\n\nHolly Otterbein: They were fine. I thought it was striking that the moderators often framed questions about health care in a fairly moderate way, whereas their questions about other issues such as criminal justice and immigration tilted pretty liberal.\n\nDavid Siders: This was a well-moderated debate. It was free-flowing, with challenging questions. And the mics worked. Running for nearly three hours, however, is another question \u2014 one just about everyone in Houston was complaining about.\n\nAlex Thompson: I thought they were good but not great. The final question about facing adversity was a bit lame and allowed some of the candidates to just revert to talking points they frequently use on the trail. It was a wasted chance to elicit some new information from the candidates.\n\n\n\nWho had the most cringe-worthy moment?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: Biden somehow weaving record players into his answer on K-12 education, and Klobuchar trying to break up a confrontation by quoting Abraham Lincon\u2019s \u201cHouse divided\u201d line. Booker translating \u201cno\u201d into Spanish, got some chuckles.\n\nLaura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: Klobuchar had a lot of awkward moments from \u201cHouse divided\u201d to \u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d\n\nNatasha Korecki: Harris comparing Trump to the \u201creally small dude\u201d behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/3c/04/c54344d143aca2f92f3db8181af0/kamala-wizardoz.png\"\n\nHolly Otterbein: Everyone\u2019s jokes were really, really bad.\n\nDavid Siders: Klobuchar saying, \u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d\n\nAlex Thompson: It wasn\u2019t cringe-worthy in the moment but it quickly became clear after checking the transcript that Castro\u2019s implication that Biden was slipping mentally backfired. Castro had forgotten or misheard what Biden said and not the other way around.\n\n\n\nHow will this change the trajectory of the race?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: Overall, Biden didn\u2019t do anything that should cost him before the next debate in October. O'Rourke may raise enough money to keep his campaign running.\n\nLaura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez: Debates rarely fundamentally change a race but Biden\u2019s ability to fend off the attacks were thrown his way may have other moderate candidates doubting their chances. Meanwhile, Warren, Sanders and Harris didn\u2019t do anything risky and gave solid answers when pressed by moderators.\n\nNatasha Korecki: It didn\u2019t do what some had predicted, which is give Elizabeth Warren a clear opening to move past Biden as a frontrunner. To anyone who thought this was Warren\u2019s chance to leave Biden in the dust, it didn't happen.\n\nHolly Otterbein: Biden\u2019s performance helps him stay the front-runner another day. And though he had a so-so performance, it\u2019s good for Sanders that the debate didn\u2019t turn into a one-on-one Biden vs. Warren showdown.\n\nDavid Siders: Biden\u2019s newly aggressive posture in this debate had the effect of bringing him down to earth, in a way \u2014 the frontrunner, but an equal who could hit and be hit. But he is still dictating the terms of the contest, and if Warren or any other Democrat is going to topple him, they are going to have to find another way.\n\nAlex Thompson: Fundraising and media attention will continue to shrink for candidates outside the top five to six. That will increase desperation and they will be facing the grim prospect of going into debt or dropping out.", "description": "Six POLITICO reporters covering the presidential primary offer their insights and takeaways from the marathon showdown.", "authors": ["Politico Staff"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c4/f6/7135581746f486bc4510d73247a3/20190912-sanders-biden-warren-podium-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
