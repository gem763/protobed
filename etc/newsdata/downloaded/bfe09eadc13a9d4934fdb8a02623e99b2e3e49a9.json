Daniel Munoz\n\nThe government underwriting for early works for QNI comes ahead of the final regulatory determination of the project by the Australian Energy Regulator.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the $51 million each government was offering would ensure the security of electricity in NSW.\n\n\u201cThis is about putting downward pressure on wholesale prices to make sure businesses and households have access to reliable and affordable power,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\n\u201cIndustry needs certainty. They need to know their electricity won\u2019t cut out, and their power bill won\u2019t suddenly double.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are underwriting this interconnector. It\u2019s a practical step to make sure it happens, and it happens quickly.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTransgrid was privatised by the NSW government in 2015.\n\nThe existing main interconnector between NSW and Queensland, known as the QNI, is close to full capacity and is mostly one-way traffic heading south, with up to 1000 megawatts being shifted to NSW some days to help with high demand.\n\nQueensland has a comparatively younger fleet of coal-fired power stations, which can help with any potential shortfall in NSW, as well as existing gas fields.\n\nTransGrid had said an expanded interconnector between NSW and Queensland would be cheaper than building new generation to replace AGL Energy's Liddell coal-fired power plant.\n\nNSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the NSW government was committed to providing reliable and affordable electricity to the people of NSW.\n\n\u201cThe QNI upgrade will ease cost of living pressures for people across NSW, providing reliable and affordable power to households and businesses,\u201d Ms Berejiklian said.\n\nThe governments said their liability would only be for any early work costs not approved by the Australian Energy Regulator as part of its regulatory assessment.\n\nThe NSW-Queensland transmission interconnector was declared a high-priority project under the Australian Energy Market Operator\u2019s Integrated System Plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe regulator also recommended an upgrade to the VNI between Victoria and NSW.\n\nThe government opted not to underwrite VNI.\n\n\"This was not required as the regulatory assessment process found a lower cost engineering option for VNI which will deliver upgrades for an additional 170 MW of capacity from the existing Snowy Mountain hydroelectric scheme by September 2021,\" the government said.\n\nA government source said the announced QNI support will allow TransGrid to deploy capital to invest in the NSW-Victoria interconnector, amid concerns the southern state is facing energy reliability risks during peak demand periods in hot weather.", "description": "The move aims to shore up energy security and reliability as concerns mount about potential power shortages this summer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_21/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/707046e0b92ae94f8882c35e5fdf5caafcf83806", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
