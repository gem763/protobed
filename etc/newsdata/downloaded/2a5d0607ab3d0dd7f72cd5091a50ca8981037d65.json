I just didn\u2019t think it was worth it.\u201d The billionaire CEO declined to specify who he meant by \u201ceveryone,\u201d but the fight over hoverboard patents is not new, and it revolves around just a few players.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was worth it.\u201d\n\nShane Chen \u2014 founder of a company called Inventist \u2014 is listed as the inventor on the patent associated with the most popular style of hoverboard. One of the keys to Chen\u2019s patent is that it covers the split in the middle of a hoverboard, which allows the two opposite sides to twist as the rider applies pressure in order to change speed and direction.\n\nChen used this innovation to make and sell a hoverboard called Hovertrax. When a wave of hoverboard knockoffs from China started to flood the market in the United States in 2015, Chen used his patent to keep as many competitors at bay as possible. It wasn\u2019t enough to keep all of them back, but it was a strong enough foothold that toy company Razor eventually decided to buy the rights to the Hovertrax. The company then took up the bulk of Chen\u2019s legal battles.\n\nRazor didn\u2019t get the rights to the patent easily, though. Cuban tried to strike a deal with Chen in 2015 when hoverboards were still hot (though not explosively hot \u2014 yet), but eventually relented because of the swelling legal drama. He told BuzzFeed at the time he\u2019d decided instead to create a new hoverboard that \u201crespects necessary IP and introduces our own.\u201d\n\nTwo years after making that promise, a small company called Radical Transport \u2014 backed by Cuban \u2014 came out of stealth promising an evolved take on the idea of a hoverboard that didn\u2019t twist in the middle. Instead, it used sensors to measure the flex in the board and translated those inputs into movement.\n\nThe board also featured bigger wheels, a wider base, premium materials, and a cut-out handle for carrying it around. It was supposed to have swappable decks with different styles and colors, and a smart, fully featured mobile app, too. Where other hoverboard companies had pushed to drive down the price, sometimes by sacrificing safety, Radical Transport decided to go high-end \u2014 a strategy that was reflected in the $1,300 price tag.\n\nRadical Transport launched the Moov, as it was called, on Kickstarter last summer. The company, which consisted of just three people, raised $75,038 and promised the Moov would ship by the 2017 holiday season. (Asked last year why he chose to use Kickstarter, Cuban responded: \u201cWhy not?\u201d) On August 22nd, Radical Transport announced it had struck a deal with a third-party company to handle assembly and shipment. At that point, it still looked like the Moov was on track.\n\nOne week later, though, an inventor named Daniel Wood was granted a patent for a very similar idea. Wood is currently employed by Future Motion, which makes the OneWheel \u2014 a self-balancing vehicle that operates like a single-wheeled skateboard \u2014 and was also involved in the development of other self-balancing rideables like the Hovetrax and Solowheel, he told The Verge. Wood also developed a self-balancing unicycle with his own company, Focus Designs, nearly a decade ago, and even appeared on Shark Tank to pitch the idea.\n\nRadical Transport was not the only company that thought of a way around Shane Chen\u2019s patent\n\nWood told The Verge that he spent years developing his no-pivot version of the hoverboard after having experienced a fallout with Chen, and that he \u201ctried several times to make a deal with Cuban\u201d before and after his patent was granted, though to no avail.\n\nWood\u2019s patent might not have been a roadblock for Radical Transport, according to EJ Williams, the former vice president of engineering. Instead, Williams said in a message, this was just a case of unfortunate timing. \u201cSince [the hoverboard\u2019s] popularity happened overnight, everyone filed patents around the same time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut since you can\u2019t see or find a patent that is pending... then you don\u2019t know what the other people are pursuing as patents until a year or so after they \u2018drew their line in the sand\u2019 and claimed a certain technology as theirs.\u201d\n\nCuban, meanwhile, said Radical Transport does have the right IP needed to make and sell the Moov, but that he doesn\u2019t see the company \u201cactivating it\u201d any time soon. He just \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be the one who fought all the battles,\u201d he said.\n\nWhatever the case, Radical Transport announced in late November that it was \u201cin the process of evaluating a partnership\u201d that would allow the company \u201cto make an even better Moov than originally designed,\u201d but didn\u2019t say anything after that. Radical Transport\u2019s three employees \u2014 Williams included \u2014 have all left the company for new ventures, according to LinkedIn. Its social media channels have been dormant for months, and the company\u2019s domain name has been taken over by a scam effort purporting to be Time Warner Cable, a cable television service that no longer exists.", "description": "Texas-based Radical Transport announced the Moov hoverboard last spring, but the product has been shelved for months.
