The man who tweeted the video, Elad Nehorai, wrote it was because police waiting outside were pointing their guns at a man seen sitting with his hands up.\n\nOnce the doors open, two officers enter and push the man to the ground. Those officers are surrounding by more than eight additional officers, and as Nehorai exits the subway car and continues filming from the platform, even more officers can be seen trying to block those recording the scene on their phones.\n\nThe NYPD confirmed to Insider that the officers were responding to an alert for a male with a gun on Friday, but that the \"investigation determined that report to be unfounded.\" The man was placed under arrest for theft of service, in this case subway fare evasion.\n\nAfter it was discovered that the man had been arrested for fare evasion, Nehorai followed up with a tweet saying \"Even when I was in the train and fully aware he might have a gun, the only scary thing about the experience was the police response. That they arrested him despite being wrong about the weapon alone is egregious.\"\n\nIn June, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced what has already proved to be a controversial policy to stem fare evasion, which Cuomo says loses the transportation system $240 million a year. At least 500 uniformed officers are currently being placed on bus routes and in subway stations to seek out offenders.\n\nHowever, Cuomo already previously stated that the policy was not intended to lead to more arrests; rather, he wanted to deter people from evading the subway fare, a move that has been criticized for disproportionately targeting low-income individuals.\n\nIn addition to the increased law enforcement presence, the city also implemented signage warning New Yorkers to pay the $2.75 subway fare or risk a $100 fine. The signs also asked that people not hold the gates open for fare evaders. Subway activists have in turn put up signs of their own asking for people to \"swipe it forward\" and help those who can't afford the fare.", "description": "The video filmed by a fellow passenger shows a horrified crowd and the man with his hands up, waiting for officers to board the subway car.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db5d808695b584f704c5e82?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
