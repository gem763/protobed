For me, that\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d\n\nKimmel saved his most vicious attack for Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara, wife of his son Eric, after she praised his recent decision to pull U.S. troops out of Kurdish-controlled northern Syria in a Fox News interview, suggesting that most Americans would have to use Google just to find out who the Kurdish people are.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d also have to google, \u2018Who is the heartless imbecile with lip injections on my TV right now?\u2019\u201d Kimmel added. \u201cThe Kurds, Lara, are our allies, and if they get slaughtered ISIS moves in. They\u2019re really scraping the bottom of the Trump-family barrel on the news.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Left-wing late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel unloaded on President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump, describing her as a \"heartless imbecile with lip injections.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/kimmeldefendshunter1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
