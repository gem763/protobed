It was normalized.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday, Damiano and another plaintiff described how they had no avenue to report their abuse to authorities.\n\n\"He abused all of us in our early childhood... That's a scar and trauma that stays with you,\" 59-year-old Marlene Hodge said, according to the Journal News. \"We were little girls... We didn't know how to take care of something that needed [to be told].\"\n\nMany students feared speaking out to parents or family members due to difficulties in communication, the Times reported, resulting in the abuse going unreported for decades.\n\nAttorneys for the school, referred to colloquially as Fanwood, did not respond to requests for comment from the Times and the school itself did immediately return The Hill's request for more information.", "description": "A dozen former students of a New York school for deaf children filed a lawsuit Wednesday arguing that they were abused by the male overseer of a female dormitory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/policelinetape11032017getty_0_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
