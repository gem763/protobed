Both women appeared to be fighting tears.\n\nIt was an arresting moment, one that felt raw and brave enough to cut through the daily onslaught of #MeToo revelations in the fall of 2017. But, as genuine as Guthrie and Kotb might\u2019ve been, the announcement also functioned as a savvy attempt to reinstill trust in a news organization that had apparently failed to protect its staff from chilling abuses of power. That uncomfortable mix of real emotion and calculated crisis PR is a subject of fascination for The Morning Show, which enlists Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in the flagship offering from Apple TV+.\n\nThe most polished of a handful of series debuting with the Nov. 1 launch of Apple\u2019s streaming service, the drama follows the cutthroat cast and crew of a Today-like show. The project, based on media reporter Brian Stelter\u2019s 2013 nonfiction book Top of the Morning, was greenlighted before the Lauer bombshell dropped. But its creative team (which includes executive producers Aniston and Witherspoon) made drastic changes in response to #MeToo, hiring a female showrunner, Friday Night Lights vet Kerry Ehrin, and shifting the story\u2019s focus to a sexual-misconduct scandal involving a male anchor (Carell\u2019s Mitch Kessler). In the premiere, Aniston, who plays Mitch\u2019s longtime co-host Alex Levy, gives a monologue clearly inspired by Guthrie\u2019s. What Alex\u2019s viewers don\u2019t know is that her performance is, in large part, a woman\u2019s desperate ploy to save her job\u2014and that her feelings about Mitch are actually quite complicated.\n\nAs she jockeys for an advantage in contract negotiations with suits who see her as an over-the-hill ice queen, a new face appears at the office: local-news reporter Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon, in an impressive 180-degree pivot from her officious Big Little Lies character), a smart, blunt libertarian with a quick temper and a working-class mom and brother who rely on her support. Bradley\u2019s politics and personality have cost her plenty of jobs\u2014making her both an unlikely Morning Show hire and an ideal foil for Alex, whose poised veneer conceals years of simmering rage.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It goes all-in on prestige-TV signifiers, investing in a dream supporting cast (Mark Duplass, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Billy Crudup, N\u00e9stor Carbonell, Bel Powley) and music from Oscar nominee Carter Burwell. If it takes a while to get a feel for most characters, Alex and Bradley come off as logical extensions of Aniston\u2019s girls\u2019-girl relatability and Witherspoon\u2019s intensity.\n\nYet the show doesn\u2019t have the same depth or experimental spirit as the top tier of TV in 2019. Rather, it resembles a more muted Shonda Rhimes serial or a less smug Aaron Sorkin joint\u2014it\u2019s pithy and easy to watch but rarely as thought-provoking as you\u2019d hope, given the topic. Mitch\u2019s murky, sub-Lauer sins and Carell\u2019s operatic tears hint at moral ambiguity without confronting it, and Ehrin adds little (in the three episodes sent to critics) to the #MeToo discourse. The Morning Show could make a great core program for Apple TV+, if only its scripts had the courage of its lead characters.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The new streaming service's flagship show casts Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell as TV journalists post-#MeToo.", "authors": ["Judy Berman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/the_morning_show_ja_rw.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
