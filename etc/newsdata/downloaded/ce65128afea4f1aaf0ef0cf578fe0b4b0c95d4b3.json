He confirmed far-right and anti-Semitic motives\u201d for the attack, said the spokesperson, according to Germany\u2019s Deutsche Welle broadcaster.\n\nProsecutors said the suspect unsuccessfully tried to enter a synagogue in the east German city of Halle on Wednesday while armed with four guns and several explosive devices. He eventually abandoned the effort and shot and killed two people and injured several others nearby, according to the authorities.\n\nThe suspect was arrested shortly after the rampage started and has been charged with two counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.\n\n\u201cIt would be nonsensical to deny it, and he didn\u2019t do that,\u201d the suspect\u2019s defense lawyer, Hans-Dieter Weber told Germany\u2019s public broadcaster, S\u00fcdwestrundfunk. \u201cIn his view of the world, he blames others for his own misery and that\u2019s what ultimately triggered his action.\u201d\n\nThe incident was broadcast live on the internet by the suspect for 35 minutes using Twitch, a livestreaming service owned by Amazon, and a recording was automatically uploaded to the platform afterward and subsequently shared on other sites and services. It has accordingly sparked comparisons to another rampage this past March when dozens of people were murdered at two mosques in New Zealand by a lone gunman who livestreamed the massacre.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
