Tulsi Gabbard's (D-HI) latest tweet attacking President Trump may win her the prize for most oblivious 2020 candidate. See below.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump\n\n\n\nTrump awaits instructions from his Saudi masters. Having our country act as Saudi Arabia's bitch is not \"America First.\" https://t.co/kJOCpqwaQS \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) September 16, 2019\n\nWhile Gabbard's message had the potential to be a real zinger (not), it instead reminded us that she has a history of extending her hand to dictators like Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard met with Assad in 2017 despite his being exposed as a war criminal whose government orchestrated cruel chemical gas attacks on his own people in the midst of the Syrian civl war. Gabbard answered critics by noting she's willing to meet with anyone, even \"brutal dictators,\" if that meeting has the potential to save American lives.\n\nAs such, her line of attack on Trump got a good chuckle out of Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL). He was \"impressed\" by both her hypocrisy and her tough guy rhetoric.\n\nOh you\u2019re tough! Used a naughty word! Did your master Assad/Putin write that? https://t.co/8GsBTxqWQn \u2014 Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) September 16, 2019\n\n\"Tulsi Gabbard Assad\" is one of the top Google searches associated with her name. Not a good look.\n\nHer 2020 opponents have addressed the Assad scandal too. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), for instance, clapped back at Gabbard as an Assad \"apologist\" after Gabbard criticized her criminal justice record.", "description": ".09/16/2019 19:10:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/137/f1c61773-57dd-4e5a-96c7-3045358f05e5.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
