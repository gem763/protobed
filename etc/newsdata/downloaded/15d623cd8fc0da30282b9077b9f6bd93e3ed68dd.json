Surely there should be a priority when a child is the victim of a crime like this? They should take things more seriously.\n\n\"We understand they're stretched sometimes, but we asked for help and we got nothing.\"\n\nWhile the force acts \"promptly\" on reports of corruption within its ranks, \"it needs to proactively root out corruption and identify those people at risk of it, to try and prevent it from happening\", the report said.\n\nFurther criticism included crime prevention not being treated as a \"priority\" and the force not having a good enough understanding of local concerns.\n\nGetty Images Cleveland Police in numbers 1,198Police officers 566,200 Population\n\n67,307 Crimes recorded\n\n450complaint allegations per 1,000 employees in 2017-18 Source: IOPC/Home Office\n\nAlmost 450 assessments for people judged to be at high and medium levels of risk were not progressed with some having waited three months, and children were put in danger of domestic abuse after the force failed to class them as vulnerable.\n\nInspectors said their findings were \"so worrying\" they had chosen to publish the report sooner than originally planned.\n\n'Systemic failings'\n\nPhil Gormley, Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, told the BBC: \"The most critical issue is getting stable, competent and capable leadership into Cleveland Police. The workforce needs clarity and leadership.\n\n\"What we are seeing is a force that has individual, collective and systemic failings.\"\n\nRecent years have seen the force engulfed by controversy. It has admitted misusing anti-terror legislation to spy on journalists and there have been numerous scandals centring on officers' behaviour including an inspector who targeted junior colleagues for sex.\n\nIn April, the force's assistant chief constable Adrian Roberts was arrested and suspended on suspicion of gross misconduct.\n\nThe allegations against him have not been made public.\n\nBBC How can somebody who gets paid \u00a380,000 a year to oversee the running of the force, dare to come out and say it's not his responsibility? How dare he do that.\"\n\nThe force, which covers areas including Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough, has had five chief constables in seven years.\n\nMike Veale resigned from the post in January over allegations he behaved inappropriately towards colleagues.\n\nMr Lewis, who was appointed his successor in April, said the report was \"entirely accurate\" and \"must act as a line in the sand\".\n\n\"This must be the basis from which we improve. It is a wake-up call for the organisation and we are now being honest about where our requirements for improvement lie.\n\n\"It is a fundamental requirement of a police service to protect the people it serves.\n\n\"Our staff have not been well served by the senior leadership of this force.\"\n\nAnalysis by June Kelly, Home Affairs correspondent\n\nCleveland has now achieved official infamy - the first force in the country to be declared as failing by the police inspectorate.\n\nIn recent years local people could be forgiven for wondering who was in charge.\n\nIn 2012 the then Chief Constable Sean Price was sacked for gross misconduct. In the years since, four other chiefs have gone through the revolving doors at police HQ.\n\nIn April, Richard Lewis was appointed. He now has a new top team as he faces the mammoth task of turning the force around. He insists it should not be scrapped and merged with a neighbouring force.\n\nIf there is no improvement the Home Secretary has the power to step in and decide Cleveland's future.\n\nNeighbourhood policing teams were being re-established, Mr Lewis said, while \"every stage of the reporting, investigating and safeguarding process is under review\".\n\nBarry Coppinger, who has been Cleveland's Police and Crime Commissioner since 2012, again rejected calls for his resignation.\n\nHe described the force's performance as \"unacceptable\" and said he had sought assurance from Mr Lewis that \"immediate changes are being made to resolve the most serious issues\".\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
