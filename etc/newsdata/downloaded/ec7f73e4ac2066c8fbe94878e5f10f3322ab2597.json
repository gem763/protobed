One has grown into the shape of a smiley face. On the other side of the laboratory, something important is happening with vials, pipettes and foil-covered bottles containing what looks a lot like urine.\n\nThe aim is to produce a chewing gum that accurately predicts the female fertility cycle. \u201cWe need to see if the active ingredient survives in chewing gum, then we\u2019ll add flavours,\u201d says one of the researchers, Anett St\u00e8ger.\n\nA team of 13 students from the University of Copenhagen is on a mission to create a product to help women improve their chances of getting pregnant. Biotechnology and molecular bioscience students have been working together to create a \u201csmart chewing gum\u201d that will change colour to show where women are in their menstrual cycles.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside? Show Hide Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

The project, nicknamed \u201cOvulaid\u201d, was started as a Danish entry into iGEM, the world championship in synthetic biology, which starts in Boston at the end of October.\n\nThe researchers are an international bunch, with scientists from Nepal, India, Germany and Hungary as well as Denmark. Seven are women.\n\n\u201cThe competition can get quite intense,\u201d says St\u00e8ger, who is Hungarian. \u201cWe\u2019re working 40 hours a week on this, on top of our normal studies \u2013 so the drop-out rate is usually high. But we\u2019ve only had one person leave. It\u2019s a project we\u2019re all really passionate about.\u201d\n\nA fellow team-member, Hitesh Gelli Praveenkumar from India, first came up with the idea of a diagnostic gum when the group began brainstorming in February, before Benedicte Smith-Sivertsen, a Dane, suggested it could help women conceive.\n\n\u201cMy sister was going through fertility treatment at the time,\u201d says Smith-Sivertsen, \u201cand I was surprised by how hard it was \u2013 all these huge syringes and peeing on sticks every day. I just thought, why hasn\u2019t anyone made this easier?\u201d\n\nMost over the counter ovulation tests currently monitor LH levels, with higher end and more expensive ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen. \u201cBut we thought, what about a chewing gum that could do all of that, as well as measuring progesterone (which helps the uterus prepare for pregnancy) at a fraction of the cost?\u201d says St\u00e8ger.\n\nThere is clearly some work to be done. A prototype tastes a bit like wax.\n\nThe researchers are working on a smartphone app to accompany the chewing gum for easy interpretation of the colour results and the gum is biodegradable.\n\n\u201cThe plan is that the gum will be very discreet in terms of packaging, available in supermarkets in a variety of flavours, and much, much cheaper than existing ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen that you pee on,\u201d says St\u00e8ger.\n\nThe hope is that Ovulaid will also have a developing world application. \u201cWe\u2019ve conducted research with gynaecology clinics in rural India, where many hospitals don\u2019t have the resources for regular fertility testing,\u201d says Gelli, \u201cso there\u2019s a real excitement about the gum.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve also looked into the impact it could have on areas such as Africa, where infertility is taboo. However, the market that may prove trickiest is Europe because the gum will contain a genetically-modified biosensor, and GM is tightly controlled in the EU.\n\nAs part of the project, the team surveyed 1,500 women, 90% of whom said they still would like to use the product despite the fact that it contains GM elements. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had hundreds of women getting in touch telling us they love the idea,\u201d adds St\u00e8ger.\n\nDr Shabana Bora, a fertility specialist at the Lister Fertility Clinic in London not involved in the project, expressed cautious optimism about the work, saying \u201csince many existing ovulation tests create a lot of plastic waste, a biodegradable gum could help be a more eco-friendly, cost-effective alternative.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
