But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.\"\n\nHillary & her gang of rich, powerful elite are going after me to send a msg to YOU: \u201cShut up, toe the line, or be destroyed.\u201d But we, the people, will NOT be silenced. Join me in taking our Democratic Party back & leading a govt of, by & for the people! https://t.co/TOcAOPrxye pic.twitter.com/TahfE2XOek \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 20, 2019\n\nGabbard addressed the \u201ccompletely despicable\u201d accusations against her at last week\u2019s Democratic debate, calling out CNN and The New York Times for saying she\u2019s a \u201cRussian asset and an Assad apologist.\u201d\n\nClinton then advanced the conspiracy in a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe, arguing that an unnamed female Democratic candidate for president was being groomed to become a third-party candidate.\n\n\"I'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians,\" Hillary Clinton to @davidplouffe https://t.co/DKH7BLTWs8 \u2014 Ken Thomas (@KThomasDC) October 18, 2019\n\n\"She's the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far, and - that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she is also a Russian asset \u2014 yeah, she's a Russian asset! I mean totally!\" Clinton said, referring to Gabbard.\n\nA top aide to Clinton then doubled down.\n\n\"If the nesting doll fits,\" Nick Merrill told a CNN reporter. \"This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality. If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.\"\n\nGabbard's video was not the only time since Clinton's latest comments that she has responded. The presidential candidate tweeted a biting response on Friday and has made media appearances denouncing the smears as well.\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.
