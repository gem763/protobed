Sylvia Garcia (D., Texas), who introduced the bill.\n\nThe PCAOB was established by Congress to oversee the audits of public companies. The SEC has oversight authority over the PCAOB.\n\nA spokeswoman for the PCAOB declined to comment on the proposed legislation.\n\nThe proposed PCAOB whistleblower program would have a similar structure to the one at the SEC. A tipster, or joint tipsters, who have original information on potential violations of rules related to how public companies prepare and issue audit reports and the responsibilities of the auditors could receive a monetary reward for their information.\n\nThe original information would need to be unknown to the PCAOB from any other source and could come from a tipster\u2019s independent knowledge or analysis, according to the bill.\n\nUnder the proposed rules, a tipster is entitled to between 10% and 30% of the monetary penalties when their tips result in a disciplinary proceeding by PCAOB and when the monetary penalties are more than $250,000, according to the bill. The new whistleblower program would also provide anti-retaliation protection and confidentiality protection for the tipsters that come forward.\n\nThe SEC whistleblower program had a record-breaking year in 2018. The agency has awarded roughly $387 million to 66 individuals since its creation in 2011, according to the SEC.\n\nThe PCAOB has an existing tip line to which the public could report potential violations of law or PCAOB rules, including through self reporting. But the proposed whistleblower program would provide the necessary incentives and strengthen the protection for tipsters in the audit industry to come forward, said Matthew Stock, the head of the whistleblower rewards practice at Zuckerman Law in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWith the new proposed law, there\u2019s a lot more incentives and protection in place to go to the PCAOB,\u201d said Mr. Stock.\n\nWrite to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com", "description": "PCAOB Whistleblower Protection Act of 2019 proposes to establish a whistleblower program at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that will be similar to the whistleblower program at the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "authors": ["Mengqi Sun", "Mengqi.Sun Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109521/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
