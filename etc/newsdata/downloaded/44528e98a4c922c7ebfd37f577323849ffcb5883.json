One might wonder if this appearance on Tucker Carlson\u2019s White Power Hour was actually an audition to be 2020\u2019s Jill Stein, because nothing says spoiler quite like a Democrat going on Tucker Carlson to complain about the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe DNC made a lot of mistakes in 2016, when its unfair handling of the race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders led to the resignation of chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Yet since then they\u2019ve tried extremely hard to reform and show transparency when it comes to the debate criteria. Of course no one is obligated to agree with the DNC or the benchmarks it sets. But while DNC chair Tom Perez might be annoying, he has been completely and utterly transparent about the 2020 primary\u2019s debate criteria.\n\nThis time around there is no mystery. There is no fix \u2013 or any credible allegations of one. Three months ago, in May, Perez announced that for the September debates a candidate could qualify by both polling more than 2 per cent and by having more than 130,000 unique donors. On 1 August \u2013 just 28 days ago \u2013 the New York Times ran the following statement: \u201cCandidates will need to have 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2 percent support in four polls. They have until Aug. 28 to reach those benchmarks.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how Gabbard has had trouble understanding these extremely clear benchmarks? Or, even worse, how she can possibly accuse the DNC of lacking \u201ctransparency\u201d over its criteria? These benchmarks aren\u2019t creative: they aren\u2019t poetic, but they are very clear.\n\nEven notorious liberal-DNC-loving-hippy-magazine The National Review thinks the two percent threshold is reasonable: \u201cThe threshold is 2 percent, people. If consistently getting 2 percent or more of members of your party to make you their first choice is too difficult\u2026 Well, the presidency doesn\u2019t have many easy days.\u201d The only president who polled at less than two percent in modern history was Jimmy Carter \u2013 and we all know how that ended. Still, try telling these facts to Gabbard\u2019s campaign which is citing what they describe as \u201cseveral irregularities in the selection and timing of the DNC sponsored polls.\u201d It\u2019s easy to smell where this is going. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but it feels like Gabbard is setting herself up to be \u201cDoctor\u201d Jill Stein 2.0.\n\nTulsi wasn\u2019t the only sore loser in the bunch: Bullock complained about \u201carbitrary D.N.C. debate rules\u201d and Marianne Williamson\u2019s campaign complained about polling cutoffs too. (A 13 August poll had Williamson at zero per cent, but, you know, \u201cdark forces\u201d and \u201clove energy\u201d and all that.) Quite rightly, the DNC quickly defended itself. Representative Adrienne Watson said: \"The September threshold is inclusive, transparent and low.\u201d\n\nThough there is some bad news too. The qualification rules are exactly the same for the following debate, which means there will be more time for campaigns to qualify. This means that in October we could theoretically see a stage with Tulsi and Marianne, Tom Steyer and Bill Deblahblahblah, Joe Sestak and John Delaney. Please, God, if you\u2019re up there, just make it stop.\n\nIf that happens, you\u2019re going to see a lot of extremely traumatized Democrats. For now, we can enjoy our nearly empty ten candidate debate stage but there is a chance \u2013 albeit a small one \u2013 that October will see another monster two-night soul crusher featuring Russian asset Tulsi and voodoo-witch anti-vaxxer Marianne.\n\nUltimately, losing extreme, low-polling voices from both sides as the race progresses is a good thing. I say good riddance to Tulsi and so-long to Marianne. Because if we\u2019ve learnt anything from Gabbard\u2019s second debate performance or from Bill De Blasio yelling over everyone else on the stage, it\u2019s that no one is more dangerous to a front runner than an angry low-poller with nothing to lose.", "description": "\"I think the bigger problem is that the whole process really lacks transparency,\" said presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard on Wednesday\u2019s episode of Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight.
