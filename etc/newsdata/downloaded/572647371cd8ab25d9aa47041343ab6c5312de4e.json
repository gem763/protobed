Go After His Cabinet.", "language": "en", "text": "Read: Impeachment is the song of the summer\n\nHere\u2019s the most relevant part for our time. Clymer\u2019s impeachment hearings launched on March 1, 1876. The next morning, Grant asked for and got Belknap\u2019s resignation. That very afternoon\u2014after learning of the resignation\u2014the committee impeached him anyway and referred the matter for a Senate trial.\n\nThis made perfect sense, partly because of history and partly through the interplay of two constitutional provisions. As Bowman documents, the English Parliament created impeachment in the 13th century. \u201cIt was invented as a means of asserting parliamentary power against the Crown,\u201d Bowman told me in an interview. Verbal criticism of the king himself involved some risk of disembowelment or similar unpleasantness, and was probably useless anyway. Impeachment of a minister \u201cstruck back at what Parliament perceived as executive tyranny or the invasion of Parliament\u2019s privilege,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Framers knew this history\u2014and they knew that English parliamentary tradition allowed impeachment of officials after they left office. (In the most famous case, Warren Hastings, the governor-general of India, was impeached in 1785 and acquitted nine years after he left office.)\n\nNow for the constitutional provisions. Article II, Section 4, states that the president, vice president, and \u201call civil officers of the United States\u201d can be impeached for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d English impeachment could lead to penalties up to and including beheading; the Framers thought that was a bit much. Thus, Article I, Section 3, limits the punishment for impeachment and conviction to \u201cremoval from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\u201d Belknap was no longer secretary of war, but congressional Democrats argued that he remained at least theoretically eligible to serve in elected or appointed office\u2014unless he was impeached by the House and removed by the Senate.\n\nGarrett Epps: What pleases Trump has the force of law\n\nAt his Senate trial, Belknap didn\u2019t even deny his crime; instead, he argued that his resignation barred a trial. The senators voted to proceed, and then voted 35\u201325 to convict him\u2014a majority, but less than the required two-thirds. Belknap was then indicted by the Department of Justice, but Grant intervened to halt the prosecution. Belknap went back to Keokuk, Iowa, and died in 1890.\n\nWhy would Congress have bothered with this mummery? Grant\u2019s foes were not terribly worried about a Belknap comeback\u2014but, Bowman told me, the Democrats would take any chance \u201cto move against Grant\u2019s corruption.\u201d The proceedings amassed a 1,200-page record, distributed at government expense, laying out the corrupt payments in detail.\n\nNow back to Acosta. I asked Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and the author of The Federal Impeachment Process: A Constitutional and Historical Analysis and this year\u2019s Impeachment: What Everyone Needs to Know, whether Acosta\u2019s conduct in the Epstein case might constitute an impeachable offense. Gerhardt replied that conduct before one takes office has, in the past, served as grounds for impeachment. He cited the 2010 case of Thomas Porteous, a federal district judge who was charged with\u2014among other offenses\u2014taking kickbacks as a state-court judge before his federal appointment. Not only was Porteous convicted and removed\u2014he was also disqualified from future office (making him one of only three people ever given that additional penalty). Bowman agreed; since the Porteous case, he said, \u201cthe precedent is now clear\u201d that conduct before taking office can be grounds for impeachment.", "description": "The story of William Belknap provides a way forward for Democrats.", "authors": ["Garrett Epps", "Professor Of Constitutional Law At The University Of Baltimore"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/AP_17183602323238/facebook.jpg?1563227939", "published_at": "2019-07-16"}
