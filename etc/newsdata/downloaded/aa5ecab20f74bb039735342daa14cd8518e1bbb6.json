I've got to be able to train a couple of days out and then face fast bowling to make sure my reaction time is in place.\"\n\nA dark reminder\n\nThe sight of an Australian batsmen lying prone on the ground having been struck by a cricket ball brought back some troubling memories for Australian cricket.\n\nIn 2014, Australian batsman Phillip Hughes died aged 25, two days after being hit in the head by a ball when batting in a domestic match.\n\nFollowing Hughes' tragic death, changes were made to further protect batsmen, with stem guards designed and made optional for players to wear on their helmets.\n\nSpectators pay tribute to former cricketer Phillip Hughes.\n\nAfter initially not feeling comfortable playing with the guards on his helmet, Smith believes he may have to rethink his stance on them following this recent episode.\n\n\"I think I, along with a few other players in the team, find it a little bit different, uncomfortable compared to what we're used to,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel a little bit claustrophobic when it's on. I feel like I'm enclosed and not overly comfortable.\n\n\"It's certainly something I need to probably have a look at and perhaps try in the nets and see if I can find a way to get comfortable with it.\"\n\nThe correct decision\n\nResearch carried out by Cricket Australia shows that delayed concussion -- where symptoms don't develop until several hours after the initial blow -- occur in approximately 30% of cases.\n\nIn the second Test at Lord's, three players were hit on the head and Smith was the only player to suffer a concussion.\n\nSmith lays on the pitch after being hit in the head by Jofra Archer.\n\nAnd given only around 20% of head impacts in cricket result in a concussion , Alex Kountouris, Cricket Australia's manager of sports medicine, believes removing a player from the game every time they were struck in the head would be unnecessary.\n\n\"The reality is only about one in five or six head impacts end up in concussion,\" Kountouris said at a press conference in Australia on Monday\n\n\"If we pulled out every player who had a head impact, we'd be pulling out 80% of players who don't have a concussion and taking them out of the game. So that would be an overreaction.\n\n\"If you look at that game, there were three other head impacts and only Steve had a concussion.\n\n\"He didn't have a concussion at the time (he was hit) so he was allowed to play. If we took him out of the game, we would have been leaving him out of the game for no reason other than what we saw on the field.\"\n\nFollowing protocols\n\nKountouris also said he was \"100%\" satisfied by Dr. Saw's treatment of Smith.\n\n\"At the end of the day, our doctor pulled him out of day five of the Test match, which was a pretty critical part of the game,\" he said.\n\n\"Our doctor is an expert in his field, he's trained to pick up even the minor signs of concussion.\n\n\"(He) was brilliant. Everything he did was according to the protocol, he was very thorough, and we know he's very thorough. We're 100% happy with what happened over there.\"\n\nAustralian lead the series 1-0.", "description": "Australian batsman Steve Smith has been ruled out of the third Ashes Test after failing to recover from the concussion he suffered on Lord's on Saturday.", "authors": ["Ben Morse", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190819110801-steve-smith-australia-hit-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
