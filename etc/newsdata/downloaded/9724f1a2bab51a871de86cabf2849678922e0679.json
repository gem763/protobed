(Chris Seward/AP)\n\nPresident Trump and his Republican allies won a battle of political heft and symbolism in a North Carolina special election on Tuesday, maintaining their hold on a House seat after a last-minute visit by Trump, a campaign message that stoked fear over socialism, and the continued erosion of Democratic strength in rural counties.\n\nBut even as they reveled, the victory also reaffirmed a continued political realignment across the country that holds peril for Republicans, who have strengthened their hold on rural areas at the expense of once Republican-friendly suburbs, where growing opposition to President Trump helped deliver control of the House to Democrats in 2018.\n\nThe results were mixed for Democrats as well. In addition to losing the seat, they faced the reckoning about their continued difficulty in rural areas, and the taint on their candidate from high-profile Democrats in Washington.\n\nBut the close nature of Republican State Sen. Dan Bishop\u2019s two-point win over Democratic businessman Dan McCready gave Democrats reason for optimism despite the loss. Less than three years ago, Trump had been able to carry Bishop\u2019s district, which stretches from Charlotte to Fayetteville along the state\u2019s southern border, by nearly 12 points.\n\n\u201cClearly the political wind is still in the face of Republicans in many ways, particularly in the suburbs,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a longtime adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u201cBut it\u2019s also impossible to ignore the continued shift of rural Democrats firmly into the Republican camp.\u201d\n\nA similar 10-point shift from 2016 toward Democrats in 2020 would all but ensure Democrats keep control of the House, jeopardize several Republican-held Senate seats and potentially undermine Trump\u2019s reelection hopes in states he won in 2016, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and even North Carolina. There are 35 GOP House seats with less Republican-leaning electorates than the North Carolina district, according to the Cook Political Report.\n\nDemocrats in the state said they hoped Republicans take the wrong lessons from the result and further embrace a president who is repolarizing the electorate.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a huge strategic win for Democrats on that level \u2014 the fact that Trump is going to say: \u2018See guys, look, stick with me and you can win,\u2019\u201d said Morgan Jackson, a North Carolina-based consultant who worked with McCready.\n\n\u201cBy doing that, you\u2019ve got suburbs and exurbs, much less urban areas in your district, that are going to underperform by five, by 10, by 15 points from just where he was a few years ago. It\u2019s a really dangerous marriage for a lot of the Republicans running for Congress.\u201d\n\nDespite the shrunken margin, Trump allies rejected the idea Wednesday that the election result revealed any weakness for the party or the president\u2019s reelection odds. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale boasted in a call with reporters that he believes Democratic states such as New Mexico are within reach. He dismissed concerns of suburban flight from the GOP.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like we have a problem,\u201d Parscale said. \u201cThe president is clearly in the driver seat to win reelection.\u201d\n\nRepublicans spent the day publicly crediting Trump\u2019s visit Monday, and his private strategic guidance, with pushing Bishop over the line. At the Monday rally in Fayetteville, Bishop appeared onstage with nearly the same uniform as Trump: a dark blue suit and red tie.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand that Trump totally dominated the news in the week leading up to Election Day,\u201d said Scott Reed, a senior political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which ran a large digital and text-message effort for Bishop targeting business owners in the suburban parts of the district. \u201cMcCready couldn\u2019t get arrested in the last 48 hours.\u201d\n\nBut there were other factors that contributed to Bishop\u2019s victory that few Republicans will be able to replicate elsewhere, including GOP overperformance relative to 2018 in areas of Robeson County populated by members of the Lumbee Tribe of Native Americans. Bishop did extensive outreach to that socially conservative community, trumpeting his efforts as a state lawmaker to increase grants to the tribe.\n\n\u201cHe really understood the importance of that vote,\u201d said state Rep. Charles Graham, a Democrat who represents western Robeson County and is the only Lumbee member of the general assembly. \u201cI think he did a great job promoting his accomplishments.\u201d\n\nBeyond that area, the results revealed the same geographic trends that have come to define politics in the Trump era. Partisanship is deeper, base turnout is more important and moderate, better-educated swing voters are moving toward the Democrats. McCready won the Charlotte suburbs of Mecklenburg County by a 12-point margin, beating his nine- point margin in 2018.\n\nIn the last race in the district, Republican Mark Harris beat McCready in 2018 by less than 1,000 votes, but the results were later tossed out and a new election ordered after evidence emerged of absentee ballot tampering by Harris campaign staff.\n\nDemocratic enthusiasm allowed McCready, a retired Marine captain, to raise more than three times as much money as Bishop directly for Tuesday\u2019s election. Under federal law, candidates receive lower broadcast advertising rates in the weeks before an election than outside groups spending on the same election. As a result, McCready and his allies were able to reach more people with their advertising than Republicans, despite similar overall spending on both sides.\n\nNonpartisan observers said Republicans should be cautious about seeing the result as a good sign.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump shouldn\u2019t get credit for bringing a bucket to put out a fire that he started,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, a nonpartisan election forecaster for Inside Elections. \u201cIf everything stays the same and it is November of 2020, I don\u2019t think President Trump wins that district by 12 points like he did in 2016.\u201d\n\nOne difference from the 2018 election was Bishop\u2019s ability to tar McCready, a Democratic moderate, by raising the records of other recently elected Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who have tried to push the party to the left in recent months. In one of his ads, Bishop surrounded himself with inflatable clowns bearing the faces of McCready, Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, among other Democrats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go to Congress and fight these clowns for you,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican leaders in Congress said Wednesday that they believed the North Carolina message showed a path for winning back some of the suburban vote while maintaining the rural advantage.\n\n\u201cThey do not want socialism. They do not want to see their private health insurance taken away. They do not want to see illegal immigrants given free health care. They do not want to see the economy destroyed by the Green New Deal,\u201d said House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). \u201cI think that those voters are absolutely going to be in a position where they understand the choice, and I feel really good about us being able to make sure they come back to us.\u201d\n\nSeveral Bishop voters in Pineville, N.C., a Charlottesville suburb, explained their vote by pointing to the recent Democratic debates and more liberal policy proposals.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats aren\u2019t even left anymore; it\u2019s the socialist Democratic Party now, not the Democratic socialist party,\u201d said Keith Simms, 55, a conservative Republican. \u201cI think they\u2019ve put the socialism part first.\u201d\n\nOthers cited their affinity with Trump. Umarin Davis, a 45-year-old cafe worker, said she voted Republican because she believes Trump has improved the lives of working class Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working class, and in society I don\u2019t feel we are really appreciated as much as the middle class, or the one percent,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were going around the wheel everyday and didn\u2019t know where we were going until Trump showed us the light. He showed us there is some improvement if we come together. \u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Josh Dawsey and Laura Hughes in Pineville, N.C.", "description": "The victory in a special election confirmed trends in the Trump era: Republicans dominate in rural areas while Democrats increase their hold in the suburbs.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sJddyStKxZ-JnFSZRGUb0QDn0VA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMDYL2GU4MI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
