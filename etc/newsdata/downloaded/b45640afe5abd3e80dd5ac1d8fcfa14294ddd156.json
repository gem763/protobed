Trump launched a trade war that has hurt Americans \u2013 one analysis found that the trade war has killed 300,000 US jobs \u2013 and is feeding concerns of a global recession, while failing to change China\u2019s behavior. Trump is so mad at his own inability to secure a deal that he frequently tweets out new tariff threats or pauses because he can\u2019t stick with a strategy, a habit which will likely continue \u2013 and continue to undermine the American economy \u2013 until Trump decides it\u2019s time to declare victory, at which point it won\u2019t matter to him whether anything substantive has been achieved.\n\nIran posed serious threats already, but Trump found a way to add yet another one by ending the nuclear deal that had verifiably stopped Iran\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear weapons program. Now, Iran is ramping up its nuclear capabilities, and growing tensions and the recent attack in Saudi Arabia have once again raised the changes of conflict. Trump\u2019s sporadic interest in diplomacy is positive (though when starting from the precipice of war, just about anything else is a positive step), but after withdrawing from the deal and alienating allies in the process, Trump has squandered any credibility or leverage to give diplomacy a chance.\n\nTrump continues to treat one of the world\u2019s most dangerous regimes \u2013 that of Vladimir Putin in Russia \u2013 as a friend, regularly undermining US interests with Russia, from his recent decision to withhold security assistance from Ukraine, to his refusal to safeguard the 2020 election from foreign interference, to the recent revelation that the CIA extracted an intelligence source from Russia in 2017 because Trump\u2019s cavalier handling of classified secrets put the asset in danger.\n\nEven when Trump\u2019s instincts might seem right \u2013 talk to North Korea, get out of Afghanistan \u2013 he can\u2019t deliver, and makes perilous situations even more dangerous.\n\nAfter almost launching an unnecessary war with North Korea, Trump reversed course and sped into a summit with Kim Jong-un instead. Diplomacy is the only way to effectively deal with North Korea, but instead of real diplomacy led by seasoned US diplomats, Trump insists on making his personal relationship the hinge on which this diplomacy depends. And so far, three photo ops with Kim have failed to deliver any meaningful results for America. Meanwhile, North Korea continues to advance its nuclear and missile programs, and Trump cares so little that he has barely seemed to notice North Korea\u2019s 10 missile tests since May.\n\nOn Afghanistan, Trump has continually claimed that he wants to end the war, but increased the US troop presence in Afghanistan instead. And while his team was working on a peace deal with the Taliban \u2013 no matter how imperfect, it could be the first step that leads to a deal between the Afghan government and the Taliban to end the conflict \u2013 Trump found a way to botch whatever small chance he had at success. Regardless of what really transpired behind the scenes of the now-cancelled (and ill-conceived) summit with the Taliban at Camp David, Trump threw the baby out with the bath water by ending the talks altogether. After almost a year of negotiations with the Taliban, Trump threw a tantrum and now says that the talks are \u201cdead\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans continue to die in Afghanistan.\n\nThe reasons for these disastrous policies are manifold. But the thread connecting them all is Trump\u2019s need to filter everything through his own ego. Trump met with Kim because no sitting president had done it before, and now Trump can\u2019t admit that it\u2019s not working. Trump ended the talks with the Taliban because his idea of a summit at Camp David didn\u2019t work out \u2013 and so if he couldn\u2019t personally bring peace to Afghanistan, he wasn\u2019t going to let anyone else do it. Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal because it was a crowning achievement of Barack Obama, and Trump\u2019s rise to prominence rested on Trump\u2019s promotion of the fiction that everything Obama did was awful. And on Russia, the Trump campaign\u2019s collusion to win the 2016 election places Trump squarely in Putin\u2019s pocket, and therefore Trump cannot change course.\n\nIf all this wasn\u2019t concerning enough, a whistleblower in the intelligence community was reportedly so concerned by a promise Trump made to a foreign leader that it was reported to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general. Trump literally cannot even be trusted to have a normal conversation with a foreign leader without potentially compromising national security.\n\nJohn Bolton is gone, and that\u2019s good. And with this president, a simple shift in the wind could trigger yet another course correction on Afghanistan, or North Korea, or anything else. But what doesn\u2019t change any time soon is the toddler who leads the most powerful country in the world. And when he fixates on a national security problem, you can be sure it will get worse, and the American people will pay the costs.", "description": "A toddler leads the most powerful country in the world.
