A headline jobs growth of 145K is expected, with wages seen rising by 0.3% month-over-month. But due to several soft pre-NFP leading indicators released throughout this week, you can almost sense that the market is bracing itself for disappointment. Read our NFP preview. If our fears are realised then the probability of a 25bps at the October 30 FOMC meeting may rise near the 100% level, which would could see the greenback break further support levels.\n\nAmong commodities, was continuing to shine brightly in due, among other things, to higher demand for haven assets. Also supporting the precious metal is a falling US dollar and rising bond prices (or put another way, falling yields \u2013 this is boosting the appeal of noninterest-bearing assets like gold and silver).

But now that some of these factors have been priced in, oil prices may fall less sharply going forward or at best start to form a base.\n\nCash Indices % Change\n\nStocks were struggling again in Europe after yesterday\u2019s .

Will opportunistic investors step in, hoping that the upcoming US-China trade talks will result in a breakthrough? Or will investors use this opportunity to close out their positions that were previously in deeper losses? We reckon that if the employment report is a poor one, then stocks may fall into the close \u2013 for the markets have responded negatively (for a change) to bad data so far in the week, suggesting investors feel that monetary policy alone is no longer enough to support stocks at these extremely elevated levels.\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nDisclaimer: The information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.
