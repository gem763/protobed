(AP Photo)\n\n\n\nWith his program already under investigation for its connection to Adidas and alleged payouts to recruits, among other things, Bill Self came under further fire Friday night when Kansas basketball\u2019s 35th-annual Late Night in the Phog season kickoff event featured some inappropriate performances.\n\nNot only was Snoop Dogg wearing Adidas gear \u2013\u2013 the brand was actually the reason the school landed him to headline the event in the first place \u2014 but he was shooting money in the air while surrounded by pole dancers at the ostensibly family-friendly event.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n.\n\nIt\u2019s actually happening. Snoop Dogg is actually at Allen Fieldhouse #kubball pic.twitter.com/V76w7PyOLa \u2014 580 Sports Talk (@580Sportstalk) October 5, 2019\n\nImagine explaining this night to your children.

Puts head down immediately. He left the court not long after, saying afterward he \"wasn't feeling well.\" https://t.co/9ts5dR3z5O \u2014 Jesse Newell (@jessenewell) October 5, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was quite the confluence of events for the Jayhawks, who are certainly looking to steer clear of any more controversy. Instead, they managed to not only have pole dancers at a school-sponsored event, but highlight their own scandal, as well as potentially throw shade at the NCAA for its current battle over whether to allow players to earn money by using cash as a performance prop.\n\nAll in a good night\u2019s work.\n\nShortly after, Self hopped on the radio to try to clear things up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a direction anyone at our school would want that to go at all. It was not the right way to provide entertainment,\u201d he said on 810 WHB.\n\nNo word, however, as to how the giant poles got into the arena without anyone at the school\u2019s knowledge.\n\nLate Friday night, Kansas athletic director Jeff Long took responsibility for the event and \u201cnot understanding what acrobatic performers are in today's entertainment world.\u201d\n\nStatement from KU AD Jeff Long regarding tonight's Snoop Dogg performance at Late Night in the Phog... #KUbball pic.twitter.com/4eHbU4YsQQ \u2014 Matt Tait (@mctait) October 5, 2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "With his program already under fire, Bill Self had to address Snoop Dogg's questionable performance", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oPuCbrpWz7XfHfCrAm7bmw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTAuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FWSAVjVSjiXapCgILK.akQ--~B/aD0yMTk2O3c9MzMwNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/640f20b0-e725-11e9-a6ab-5458a0e4f053", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
