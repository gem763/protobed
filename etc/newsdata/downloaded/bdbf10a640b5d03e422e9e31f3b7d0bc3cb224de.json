They also have played Notre Dame.\n\nMichigan entered Saturday\u2019s game with more insight than most programs have of Army\u2019s triple option thanks to assistant coach Shaun Nua. The Wolverines\u2019 first-year defensive line coach spent 2012 through \u201917 in the same capacity at Navy, helping the Midshipmen beat their rival in four of six meetings.\n\nComplete college football scoreboard\n\n\u201cI never liked Army,\u201d Nua said.\n\nThe Wolverines limited Army to 200 rushing yards. Last season, the Black Knights averaged 312.5 rushing yards, ranking second in major college football, on the way to finishing 11-2 for the most victories in program history.\n\nThe Black Knights, a three-touchdown underdog had a chance to win in regulation, but freshman place-kicker Cole Talley missed a 50-yard attempt wide right as time expired. It was his first kick in a college game.\n\nStill, Army has a favorable schedule the rest of the season in its bid to reach 12 victories.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t face another Power Five opponent, although the Black Knights do have plenty of traveling in front of them. On Nov. 2, they play Air Force in Colorado Springs, Col., in the first leg of the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s Trophy.\n\nThen on Nov. 30 in its final game before playing the Midshipmen in Philadelphia, Army goes to Hawaii for a kickoff at 12:30 a.m. East Coast time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to play in games like this,\u201d Monken said of facing Michigan. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we need to play games like that every single week, but to play a game like that each year is really important to this program. It certainly is to the guys that play here.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMaryland shreds Syracuse, setting program record for points vs. ranked foe\n\nSouth Carolina QB Ryan Hilinski has late brother as \u2018angel\u2019 on the field\n\nCincinnati player carted off field after suffering convulsions following collapse", "description": "The Black Knights forced overtime against a Power Five opponent for a second straight season before falling, 24-21.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CNDDVOWRWMI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
