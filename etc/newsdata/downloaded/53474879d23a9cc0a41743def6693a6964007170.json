Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nThe events that carried the Labour Party to this abysmal point were predictably abysmal. All afternoon the Labour delegates argued about whether to adopt \u201cComposite 13\u201d or \u201cComposite 14\u201d, or both.\n\nIn short, the first one would have forced the Labour Party to explicitly back Remain, the second allows it to keep its options open.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, a Brexiteer of three decades standing, prefers 14. And so, in seeking to defeat 13, his supporters managed to turn it into a de facto confidence vote on Corbyn\u2019s leadership, which he did not lose.\n\nIt means that Labour will fight the imminent election on a platform of what can only really be described as a Bully\u2019s Special Prize Brexit. You may decide to gamble on voting for them, but only if they win do you get to find out what\u2019s behind the screen.\n\nCould be Leave, could be Remain, could be neither. Could be a car, could be a speedboat, could be designer leisurewear for all the family.\n\nJust vote here and you\u2019ll find out later.\n\nThe mental contortions that took the party to this point were incredible. Up the various delegates came to the conference platform to make their case, principally to genuflect at the altar of Saint Jeremy.\n\nOne, from the Tottenham branch, jabbed his finger into the lectern and said: \u201cJeremy was right on Iraq, he was right on austerity, and he is right on our strategy and tactics on Brexit.\u201d\n\nIt was the most denuded example of what was, in essence, a theological debate on Corbal infallibility. This, ostensibly, was party democracy in action, but it never rose beyond the claim that, \u201cIf Jeremy says it, it must be right.\u201d\n\nDemocracy indeed, but of a decidedly North Korean kind.\n\nNot since Carl Lewis and Mike Powell battled it out on that famous night in Tokyo, in 1991, have more incredible leaps been witnessed.\n\nGary Ostrolenk, from Camberwell & Peckham, took the view that, because the 2016 referendum had actually been a referendum on austerity and neoliberalism, if the party backed Remain now, it would actually be in favour of those things. All you can do, when faced with such towering logic, is stand and applaud.\n\nA woman called Vanessa Stilwell, there ostensibly to offer a view on Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, saw fit to declare that: \u201cJeremy Corbyn is the most anti-racist leader this party has ever had!\u201d\n\nThey went wild. Labour\u2019s most anti-racist leader? Down in the lower reaches of the Freeview channels, there are precious few list shows that have not yet been made. The Labour Party\u2019s most anti-racist leaders would be compelling viewing.\n\nOn what basis Jeremy Corbyn edges out, say, Michael Foot, Keir Hardie, Neil Kinnock, Clement Attlee and the rest is not immediately clear, not least as none of them have been accused of active complicity in racism, but evidently Ms Stilwell will have some thoughts to offer. And good on her.\n\nRicher and more textured farce was to come. When the delegates in the conference hall eventually came to vote, on composite 13, a decision that was predicted to split the hall fairly evenly, they did so via a show of hands.\n\nTo everyone present, it looked fairly evenly split. Up on the platform, Wendy Nichols, the trade union official who was chairing the occasion, was sitting next to Jennie Formby, Labour\u2019s General Secretary and key Corbyn ally. The words she uttered next were as historic as things ever get. She looked out at the room. She paused. She couldn\u2019t seem to make up her mind.\n\n\u201cI thought it was one way,\u201d she said. \u201cJennie said something else. That was lost.\u201d\n\nThere were gasps and cheers in equal measure. Ms Nichols, the actual chair of the event, thought that the motion had carried, that Remain had won, but was saying, openly, that she had been overruled.\n\nThere was the option, at this point, to have an actual \u201ccard vote\u201d \u2013 to count up the votes properly, if the show of hands is inconclusive. But that was rejected too. Half the hall, and I do mean half, exactly half, began chanting \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d\n\nOver the coming days, weeks and months, when Corbyn has no choice but to avoid giving an honest answer as to his own views on Brexit, he will, as a matter of certainty, defer to the position that it is not his choice to make, that \u201cthe Labour party is a democratic party\u201d and it will be up to the party to decide.\n\nThis, this, is the democracy he has in mind. I thought it was one way. Jennie said something else.\n\nThey are words that should go on the party\u2019s tombstone, perhaps in just a few weeks.", "description": "Perhaps the only way to make sense of all the shouting and screaming and chanting and voting as the Labour Party moved to formalise its most recent position on Brexit, is to close our eyes and transport ourselves to your front door in a few weeks time.
