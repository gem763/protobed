It wasn\u2019t aimed at him, it was nothing at all.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shut the pub for one swear word taking all the money from the till and safe, and left the pub landlady and landlord jobless and homeless.\n\n\"It\u2019s not like it was closed after a brawl.\u201d\n\n(Image: Dave Evitts / SWNS)\n\nAnother local said: \u201cThe man was telling his wife a dirty joke and said the F-word. It wasn\u2019t aggressive. They were both laughing and joking.\n\n\u201cNo one can quite believe the pub\u2019s been shut. It\u2019s a bit daft really because a pub\u2019s where you go to let off steam and enjoy a bit of banter with other people.\n\n\"A ban on swearing is a bit much.\u201d\n\n(Image: Dave Evitts / SWNS)\n\nOther locals expressed their anger on Facebook, blasting the brewery for closing the pub.\n\nJeanette Burton wrote: \u201cIt leaves two great managers job less homeless with no excuse, disgusting.\u201d\n\nShelley Mitchell posted: \u201cI am not a pub person but live close to the Fox And Goose pub and over the last few months I have seen how much work has gone to clean up and open it up.\u201d\n\nLocals have set up a GoFundMe page to help out the landlord and his wife following the pub being closed.", "description": "The Samuel Smith's pub was only opened seven weeks ago but now its landlord says it's closed for business", "authors": ["Mark Cardwell", "Image", "Dave Evitts", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551233.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_SWEAR_PUB_001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
