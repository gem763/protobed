Putting too much stock in a small sample size might cause you to make a decision that hurts you in the long run. That said, it doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be taking stock of what\u2019s happened in the immediate past. It can be useful when it comes to weekly or especially daily lineup decisions, waiver wire considerations, tracking who might be coming into more playing time, etc.\n\nThe Rotoworld Player Rater is a handy tool that\u2019s among the extensive offerings in Season Pass . Each week, I\u2019ll be using the Player Rater to look at the hottest hitters, position by position, over the last week, and providing commentary.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n*The following data is based on 5x5 Roto scoring and covers games played from September 16-22.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass .

Over his last eight contests, Vazquez has gone 10-for-27 with three long balls and 10 RBI while also chipping in a stolen base. He was even used up in the No. 2 spot in the Red Sox\u2019 lineup a couple times last week. After entering 2019 with 10 career home runs, Vazquez has smacked 22 dingers this season \u2026 Yadier Molina had a big game-tying home run off of Craig Kimbrel on Saturday as part of the Cardinals\u2019 shocking four-game sweep of the Cubs at Wrigley Field. He\u2019s batted fifth in each of his last two games. Molina has started 36 of 40 games since returning from the injured list last month \u2026 Yan Gomes has had to carry a heavier workload lately with Kurt Suzuki (elbow) banged up. He\u2019s taken advantage of the extra playing time with his best month at the plate so far this season, posting an .804 OPS with four home runs \u2026\n\nFirst Base\n\nPete Alonso entered last week hitless over his previous six games. However, he took advantage of six contests at Coors Field and Great American Ball Park, belting three over the boards while putting up a 1.271 OPS. The three dingers pushed Alonso\u2019s total for the season to a league-high 50, and with a double on Sunday he became the first rookie ever to hit 50 homers and 30 doubles. The first baseman needs two long balls this week to tie and three to break Aaron Judge\u2019s rookie home run record of 52 \u2026 Mitch Moreland had his first multi-homer game of the season on Friday and followed it up with another bomb on Sunday. It\u2019s been an injury-shortened season for the 34-year-old, but Moreland\u2019s recent surge has his OPS up to .820, which would be his highest mark since his rookie season when he played in only 47 games \u2026 Eric Thames had been scuffling at the plate with just a .486 OPS across his previous 12 tilts before breaking out of the funk with his first two-homer game of the season on Sunday. Thames has put up a .935 OPS and hit 14 of his 23 home runs at Miller Park this season. He has posted just a .766 OPS on the road \u2026\n\nSecond Base\n\nGarrett Hampson is going to be considered a fantasy bust this season no matter how he closes out his year. However, it\u2019s good to see him gain some late-season momentum with a .421/.463/.711 batting line, three home runs and five stolen bases across his last 10 contests. He\u2019s started games at three different positions during that stretch and batted leadoff on Saturday and second on Sunday for the Rockies. Hampson looks like a fine pick-up for the final week of the season, particularly if you\u2019re light on speed \u2026 Since taking over as the Mariners\u2019 leadoff hitter, Shed Long has put up a blistering .396/.431/.708 batting line with three bombs and eight RBI over 11 games. The 24-year-old looks like a good bet to open next season as a regular for the M\u2019s at this point, whether it be at second base or in the outfield (or both). One downer for Long\u2019s fantasy outlook is that he hasn\u2019t run nearly as much this year, having gone just 4-for-10 in stolen base attempts between the majors and minors \u2026 Starlin Castro had seemed like a shoo-in to be traded before the deadline, but he was hitting so poorly at the time that there was no interest. Of course, since the beginning of August he\u2019s put up a .964 OPS with 13 dingers, 40 RBI and 35 runs scored over 49 games. The upside is capped because he doesn\u2019t run and is in a terrible lineup, but Castro can still help fantasy owners in the final week while he\u2019s red-hot \u2026\n\nThird Base\n\nMiguel Sano can pile up power numbers with the best of them when he\u2019s in a groove at the plate, and it\u2019s been that way lately with six long balls and a whopping 16 RBI across his previous nine tilts. He\u2019s up to 33 home runs on the season over just 424 plate appearances. Only Jorge Soler and teammate Nelson Cruz have gone deep more times since the All-Star break among American Leaguers than Sano, who has 20 bombs since the Midsummer Classic \u2026 Tommy Edman has slid over to second base and up to the No. 2 spot in the Cardinals\u2019 lineup with Kolten Wong (hamstring) going down. The rookie is sporting a robust .417/.488/.833 batting line with three home runs, five RBI, 10 runs scored and three steals across his last 10 contests. Edman\u2019s .820 OPS is the highest mark on a team that clinched a spot in the postseason on Sunday \u2026 Mike Trout (foot) is almost surely still going to win AL MVP even after missing most of September, but Alex Bregman is doing his best to make it a conversation. The infielder has homered four times over his last seven games and is now batting an utterly ridiculous .373/.480/.745 with 13 dingers, 45 RBI and 40 runs scored across 45 games since the start of August. The only bummer with Bregman is that, just like pretty much all of the Astros, he\u2019s stopped running. Bregman has attempted only six steals in 2019 after reaching double digits in swipes each of the previous two seasons \u2026\n\nShortstop\n\nAs if the Dodgers weren\u2019t already dangerous enough, it\u2019s looking like Corey Seager is finally getting his bat going at just the right time. The shortstop has tallied six straight multi-hit games and is batting .300/.329/.614 with six long balls, 21 RBI and 13 runs scored across 18 tilts this month. He had gone deep only five times over the previous three months combined \u2026 I was among those worried about how not being allowed to dive head-first was going to affect Adalberto Mondesi\u2019s (shoulder) stolen base total upon his return. It turns out that he can still swipe plenty of bags feet-first, as the speedster stole 12 bases over his first 20 games this month. Unfortunately, he re-injured his left shoulder Sunday on a dive at shortstop, which will knock him out of commission for the final week \u2026 Speaking of stolen bases, Trea Turner is up to 34 on the season now after pilfering a couple bags last week. Turner undoubtedly would be on his way to leading the National League in steals again this season had he not missed over six weeks of action earlier this year with a fractured finger \u2026\n\nOutfield\n\nOscar Mercado really struggled in August as some of the shine started to come off of his sparkling rookie campaign. However, he\u2019s since rebounded with his best month yet, batting .325/.393/.584 with four dingers, 16 RBI, 15 runs scored and three stolen bases over 20 games so far in September. Between the majors and minors, Mercado has now belted 18 home runs and stolen 29 bases this season \u2026 It\u2019s difficult for a 30-homer season from a 22-year-old rookie to be overlooked, but it kind of feels that way this year with Eloy Jimenez. The talented young outfielder is closing out his rookie campaign with his best month, as he has posted a 1.160 OPS with eight long balls and 23 RBI over 20 September games so far. The consistency hasn\u2019t been there, but Jimenez has certainly flashed his immense upside this season \u2026 Sam Hilliard entered last week in an ugly 1-for-23 drought at the dish, but he snapped out of that funk in a major way with nine hits \u2013 including four home runs \u2013 over 15 at-bats covering five games. Hilliard earned a promotion by popping 35 home runs and stealing 22 bases at Triple-A Albuquerque, but while he\u2019s slugged six more bombs in the majors he has yet to attempt a stolen base \u2026 Cody Bellinger is likely the NL MVP front-runner after Christian Yelich (kneecap) went down, and he strengthened his case last week with a 1.018 OPS, two home runs and two stolen bases. Along with reaching 40 home runs for the first time, Bellinger has also tied a career high with 14 steals. It remains incredibly impressive that the 24-year-old has put up these numbers while also slashing his strikeout rate to 16.5 percent and upping his walk rate to 14.5 percent \u2026", "description": "Ryan Boyer highlights and analyzes the hottest hitters using Rotoworld's Season Pass Player Rater.
