We saw that during the civil rights movement, during tension after the world wars, and we always look back and regret it when we pull back on freedom of expression, and I worry that we\u2019re at a moment today where we may do the same.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook CEO also criticized what he said was a \u201csocial trend today where I see more people across the spectrum trying to label different speech as dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes they don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nHowever, Perino did not ask Zuckerberg about the multiple high-profile conservatives who are still banned from the platform for being allegedly \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook CEO was also not asked about his platform\u2019s list of potential \u201chate agents,\u201d which it uses to monitor high-profile political figures for potential banning, or its \u201cdeboosting\u201d technology, which company whistleblowers say has been used to suppress the content of mainstream conservatives.\n\nShe did, however, raise Elizabeth Warren\u2019s allegation that Facebook is willing to take money for ads from politicians even if the platform knows \u201cthat the information a politician is putting forward is false.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think that in a democracy, it\u2019s important for people to see for themselves what politicians are saying,\u201d responded Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we want private companies censoring politicians and the news.\u201d\n\nBut Facebook has already banned at least two conservative politicians from its platform in the past year.\n\n\u201cI generally believe as a principle that people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe and who they want to vote for,\u201d continued Zuckerberg.\n\nAt the same time, the Facebook CEO said there are \u201cspecific things \u2026 about the internet that we need to address.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people choose to use their voice to organize violence\u2026 people can spread misinformation faster than they were able to before, people can form new types of communities that have the potential to lead to polarization, you can livestream events now, which helps us be present with each other and capture moments we [couldn\u2019t] before, but it also helps people stream things like terrible acts of violence.\u201d\n\nFor each of these things the internet platforms and Facebook especially, we have a responsibility to make sure that we address these harms and make sure that we can address these risks,\u201d said Zuckerberg.\n\nResponding to a question about billionaires, and Bernie Sanders\u2019 argument that they shouldn\u2019t exist, Zuckerberg, himself a billionaire, agreed that \u201cin some cosmic sense \u2026 nobody deserves to have billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook CEO also addressed concerns about privacy, calling it the company\u2019s \u201ctop priority\u201d and \u201cthe most critical thing that we\u2019re working on,\u201d citing an agreement with the FTC to build a \u201cmuch more rigorous privacy program\u201d at Facebook.\n\nThe balance I\u2019m trying to get right is working through some of these big social issues around speech and content and privacy and data portability,\u201d said Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that we continue to defend people\u2019s ability to have a voice and stand up for free expression.\u201d\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
