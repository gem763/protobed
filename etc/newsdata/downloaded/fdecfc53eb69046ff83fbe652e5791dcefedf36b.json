President Cyril Ramaphosa is seeking emergency measures to curb violence.\n\nHarry and Meghan, holding hands, arrived at the non-governmental organisation to the sound of drum beats and ululating as women and children shouted out in excitement.\n\nThe couple greeted and chatted to women and children, with Meghan giving hugs to some, and danced to music.\n\n\u201cMeghan and I are truly inspired by your resilience, your spirit, your sense of community and your belief in a better future for everyone here,\u201d Harry said to applause.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to come together as a community, and we applaud those of you who are leading the way for South Africa\u2019s ongoing transformation,\u201d Harry told the crowd, which he greeted in the Xhosa language.\n\nMeghan, who addressed the people after Harry, said advocating for the rights of women and girls was a cause very close to her heart.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, wave as they visit District Six, on the first day of their African tour in Cape Town, South Africa, September 23, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\n\u201cThe work that\u2019s being done here is to keep women and children safer, which is needed now more than ever,\u201d Meghan said.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that for me, I am here with you as a mother, as a wife, as a woman, as a woman of colour and as your sister,\u201d she said to cheers.\n\nSINGING AND DANCING\n\nSpeaking at the Nyanga Methodist Church, whose windows are protected by heavy bars against burglars, Theodora Lutuli of The Justice Desk said before Harry and Meghan\u2019s arrival that the organisation was having a huge impact in the community by making children aware of their rights.\n\n\u201cThey will tell you this is my body, it belongs to me... That is what they are being taught and we are saying if it starts from there, then we are guaranteed a better future,\u201d said Lutuli, the organisation\u2019s community liaison officer.\n\nAhead of the royal couple\u2019s arrival, a small crowd of around 100 gathered outside the church, singing and dancing to the beat of a marimba band, while a throng of local and international media jostled for positions.\n\nChildren, some of nursery age, wore white Justice Desk T-shirts bearing the words \u201cI\u2019m not too young to be heard\u201d.\n\nHarry and Meghan later visited the District 6 museum that honours thousands of families forcibly removed during the apartheid era after the area, adjacent to the Cape Town business district, was declared whites-only area in 1966 and bulldozers moved in to demolish homes.\n\nThey met former residents of District 6 and toured the small double-story museum.\n\nLarge crowds waited behind metal barricades, straining to catch a glimpse of the royals, many with mobile phones. As they left, people scrambled to take pictures, with some shouting \u201cHarry, Meghan, we love you\u201d and others hanging out of building windows to catch a glimpse of the couple.\n\nHarry, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson and sixth in line to the throne, has been visiting southern Africa for two decades for holidays and conservation work.\n\nSlideshow (31 Images)\n\nHe will travel on alone for a working visit to Botswana, where the couple went shortly after they began dating in July 2016 and returned in 2017 for a romantic getaway to celebrate Meghan\u2019s 36th birthday.\n\nHarry then heads to Angola, visiting the landmine clearance project that featured in some of the most famous photographs of his late mother, Princess Diana.\n\nHe ends the solo section of his tour in Malawi, where he will meet President Peter Mutharika, before rejoining Meghan and Archie in South Africa for another township visit, this time near Johannesburg.", "description": "Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan started their tour of South Africa on Monday in a township known as the country's \"murder capital\".", "authors": ["Wendell Roelf", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433009464&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1HE", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
