Far from subordinating the economy to a moral vision, this is a libertarian\u2019s wet dream of unconstrained profit-seeking.\n\nAnother dimension to the religious right\u2019s more aggressive agenda is an emphasis on local communities (often low-density rural areas where farming remains an important aspect of daily life) as the proper locus of the yearning for moral regeneration. Yet these hopes for the future revitalization of moral standards and limits are projected onto an administration in which the Secretary of Agriculture recently warned that family farms don\u2019t have much of a future, because \u201cin America the big get bigger and the small go out.\u201d Once again, a radicalized conservative critique of liberalism sits side-by-side with a radicalized form of economic libertarianism.\n\nNowhere are such tensions more apparent than in foreign policy, where a sizable number of Republicans pine for a revival of realism and restraint (fewer wars and fewer obligations for American soldiers to police the world), whereas many others appear to favor bombing more people than ever as a way of throwing our weight around, showing the world who\u2019s boss, and bullying other nations (allies and enemies alike) into doing our bidding in purely transactional terms. These two visions of America\u2019s role in the world stand in stark contrast with one another, and the haphazard, incontinent character of the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy is the result.", "description": "", "authors": ["Damon Linker", "Theweek.Com Articles Antiestablishment-Right-Mess-Contradictions"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
