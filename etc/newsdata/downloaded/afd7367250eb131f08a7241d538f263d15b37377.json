Let's all remember what we have done together as a club over the past decade rather than what's not to be in the coming years. We have some amazing young men at the club and it's in safe hands. I will stay close and help grow the club continually in any way I can. To my teammates and coaches along the way, I'd like to thank you all for being supportive and great men. I've learnt so much in my ten years here. From the young boys all the way through to 'the fossil' John Sutton. I value each friendship created and they'll last a lifetime. To Russell \u2014 for making all this happen initially \u2014 I'll be forever indebted to you. Your passion is infectious. To the Board of Directors, and all of our wonderful men and women in the office making everything possible, thank you. My family have been by my side the whole way, on and off the field. I love you all so much. Maybe I'll come and watch a game in The Burrow next year. You truly are the heartbeat of the club. I'm sure you'll agree with me, the spirit of South Sydney is alive and will live long after me. It will always be a huge part of my heart. Just like it is yours.
