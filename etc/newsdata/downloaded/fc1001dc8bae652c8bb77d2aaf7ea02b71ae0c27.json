Adjusted net income was $3.02 billion, ahead of a FactSet-compiled consensus that forecasted adjusted net income at $2.79 billion.\n\nTotal's hydrocarbon production jumped 8% to 3.04 million barrels of oil equivalent a day compared with 2.80 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the year-earlier period. Production was boosted by a number of projects, including the Yamal's liquefied natural gas project in Russia and Ichthys in Australia, the company said.\n\nThe company says it expects its full-year production to grow by 9%.\n\nTotal reported a strong performance in its integrated gas, renewables and power business, where production rose 45% to 539,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day compared with 371,000 daily barrels of oil equivalent the same period a year earlier.\n\n\"The environment remains volatile, with uncertainty about hydrocarbon demand growth related to the outlook for global economic growth and in a context of geopolitical instability,\" the company said.\n\nSales in the third quarter were down to $48.59 billion compared with $54.72 billion the previous year, Total said.\n\nDuring the quarter, Total closed the acquisition of Anadarko's 26.5% stake in Mozambique's liquefied natural gas project for $3.9 billion.\n\nThe company declared 2019 interim dividend at EUR0.68 a share, a 6% increase compared to the previous year.\n\nWrite to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 04:38 ET (08:38 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
