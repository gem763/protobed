The plant was cutting hundreds of workers as orders from the U.S. apparel giant stalled, amid a swirling economic crisis that has plunged the country into recession for most of the last year.\n\nThe Nike factory in Misiones province, one of Argentina's poorest, is proving to be the tip of the iceberg. Around Argentina, nearly 16,000 textile and shoe factory workers have lost their jobs in the last year, according to government data, including nearly a quarter of all shoe sector workers.\n\nAnd the outlook is darkening: the peso currency has tumbled, interest rates are above 60% and annual inflation nearly 54%.\n\nIn this lush jungle town with dusty red-dirt roads, laid-off workers, union delegates and locals Reuters spoke with on a recent trip had one person to blame: President Mauricio Macri, who was defeated outright in a general election on Sunday.\n\nMacri, who came to power in late 2015 as a business-friendly candidate to industry cheers, moved to cut trade barriers, helping bolster overseas ties and increase competition for domestic suppliers. That compounded an unexpectedly sharp economic downturn since last year that has hammered consumer spending inside the country.\n\nAt the Nike plant in Eldorado that meant the factory was up against a wave of cheaper imports even as local manufacturing costs got higher. As costs rose, importing finished products became a more attractive option, industry experts said.\n\n\"It's just another job the government is getting rid of,\" Aquino said of his first thought upon learning that the owner of the Misiones plant, Brazil's Dass Group, was cutting workers last December.\n\nAquino spoke to Reuters on the porch of the modest brick house where he lives with his wife and two children. He said his home was possible thanks to the previous government of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, vice-president on the winning ticket on Sunday.\n\n\"I worked seven and a half years for the company. With my earnings, I could eat and support my family,\" said Aquino, who said he has since taken on an informal job as a driver to make ends meet. \"I can't let my children be in need.\"\n\nNike declined to comment on the reason for cutting back on its orders at the Misiones plant, but said in a statement it \"continues to evaluate our sourcing strategy based on seasonal needs and the local marketplace.\"\n\nRepresentatives from Dass Group, the Brazilian company that runs the factory, and the shoe workers' union, UTICRA, both blamed the job cuts on a steep 70% drop in shoe orders from Nike, which accounts for nearly all the factory's work.\n\nThe dynamics in Eldorado are a key reason Argentina's left-leaning Peronists have toppled market-friendly conservative Macri, whose popularity was hit as industries from carmakers to vinters in the country have reeled from falling sales.\n\n\"Production is down because of what is happening in the country, a drastic fall in consumption. It's a reality that is affecting us all,\" said Dario Vera, the factory's delegate for shoe workers' union UTICRA.\n\nHe said the sector had taken a turn for the worse in recent years under Macri's more open-door policies, such as slashing red tape that required importers to seek authorization from the national revenue service. Vera pointed to another factory closure in Chivilcoy near Buenos Aires last December after Nike-rival Adidas AG <ADSGn.DE> cut back orders.\n\nThe union, he said, was now supporting Fernandez, who has pledged to support domestic industry and revive local consumption, and could roll back some of Macri's free-trade policies to appease powerful worker unions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHIGH PRICE TO PAY\n\nThe malaise in Misiones, a province sandwiched between Brazil and Paraguay, reflects a wider struggle for Argentina's clothing and textile sectors, which have been hit by a 14.6% drop in retail sales in the first seven months of 2019, according to government data based on shopping mall purchases.\n\nAround the country, the textile and shoe sectors employ 107,000 people, the latest labor ministry data show, down around 13% over the last year. The shoe segment is down 23%.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Rumors of layoffs started spreading among workers at a factory here in northeastern Argentina making Nike Inc  shoes the night before Cristian Fredy Aquino's scheduled shift.
