Erdogan Is Bluffing", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to \u201copen the gates\u201d to Europe for Syrian refugees temporarily housed in Turkey unless the European Union stops its harsh criticism of his military operation against the Kurds of northern Syria. The threat is not new, though, and Erdogan is no more likely than before to make good on it. Instead, he\u2019ll likely push the refugees in the opposite direction.\n\nIn March 2016, Turkey signed a readmission agreement with the EU allowing the Europeans to send any undocumented immigrants arriving from Turkey back to that country. In return, the EU offered 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in aid immediately, and another 3 billion euros by the end of 2018. The deal was a key element in the chaotic but ultimately effective European effort to reduce the influx of asylum seekers from war-torn Syria and other Middle Eastern and African countries.\n\nIn the years since the deal was signed, the EU only returned some 2% of asylum seekers arriving on the Greek islands from Turkey. To avoid being sent back, the refugees began applying for asylum on the islands without waiting to reach their intended destinations such as Germany. Greece has been chronically unable to handle the application backlog, and the islands are now home to miserable, overflowing refugee camps holding more than 30,000 people.\n\nThe deal\u2019s value, however, wasn\u2019t so much in the actual readmissions but in Turkey\u2019s willingness to house an enormous number of refugees, providing them with decent enough conditions that they don\u2019t set sail for Greece. There are almost 3.7 million Syrian refugees in Turkey now. Erdogan claims Turkey has spent $40 billion to support them, far more than the $7 billion in aid he reckons the country has received from the rest of the world.\n\nErdogan started threatening to open the gates for the refugees months after the readmission deal was signed. Even in 2016, he felt the EU aid, used for things such as refugee children\u2019s schooling, wasn\u2019t coming fast enough. More recently, the threats have become more frequent as the Syrians \u2013 provided only temporary protection rather than a full refugee status \u2013 have grown increasingly unpopular in economically pressed Turkey. In July, Turkey even announced a suspension of the readmission deal in response to (rather weak) EU sanctions for Turkey\u2019s gas drilling in disputed waters near Cyprus. It doesn\u2019t really matter what the current pretext for opening the gates is; Erdogan must get rid of at least some Syrians.\n\nErdogan\u2019s most recent plan is to move up to 2 million of the refugees to a specially created \u201csafe zone\u201d along the Turkish border in Syria. That requires pushing the Kurds of the Syrian Democratic Forces 30 kilometers (18 miles) away from the border. The two goals of the current Turkish military push, condemned by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and by European governments, are to increase border security by pushing back the hostile Kurds and to get the Syrians off Turkish land.\n\nThe plan, of course, is unpopular with human rights defenders and with European governments: One doesn\u2019t resolve one humanitarian disaster by creating another. But harsh action against a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally is tough, and at this point, European condemnation doesn\u2019t amount to more than noise.\n\nSo, probably, do Erdogan\u2019s threats, though. He can bus refugees to the Syrian border, as he\u2019s already done with those who failed to register with the government, and he can stick them in areas captured by Turkish troops in Syria. But he cannot put them on ships and send them to Greece. Such open action on the part of his government would likely put an end, at least temporarily, to Turkey\u2019s customs union with the EU, exacerbating its economic problems \u2013 and Europe likely would push back the ships, anyway.\n\n\u201cOpening the gates\u201d mainly means not preventing refugees from leaving for Europe voluntarily or human traffickers from setting up shop on Turkey\u2019s Mediterranean coast. However, Turkey hasn\u2019t been doing much to stop migrant crossings lately: More monthly arrivals have been registered on the Aegean Sea islands since summer than at any time in the last two years.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0threatened\u00a0to \u201copen the gates\u201d to Europe for Syrian refugees temporarily housed in Turkey unless the European Union\u00a0stops its harsh criticism of his military operation against the Kurds of northern Syria.
