Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nNo one joins a startup to do something ordinary. But if you want to do something extraordinary, you'll need a sh-tload of money to get it all done.\n\nThat doesn't happen overnight. It happens in stages \u2014 sometimes long, mostly boring, often very scary stages. The problem is that we usually see, hear, and read about startups as overnight successes: Some kid genius has a great idea, drops out of college, works on it for a couple months, and then raises a few million dollars at a $1 billion valuation.\n\nThis is the trap: Like the lure of the lottery but with pitch decks and spreadsheets instead of Powerball tickets.\n\nBefore you try to raise money, you need to establish that what you want to build will generate revenue. And remember: Raising money is not the same as generating revenue.\n\nHere's what I usually advise to avoid this trap: You might estimate that you need a few million dollars to take a serious run at your dream company. Break that number into small pieces, and raise just enough to get to that first revenue-generating piece. As a guide, think about how much of your own funds you can scrape together to put into your company. Multiply that by 10 and go raise that.\n\nBut even before that, figure out how you'll get to your first dollar of revenue, and then build your deck, financial model, and pitch on repeating that process over and over. Because this is what almost all successful entrepreneurs do anyway \u2014 they just take bigger strides. It's also the reason investors love repeat entrepreneurs, because those entrepreneurs can say, \"Remember that time I made all that money? I'm going to do it again but a little different.\"\n\nUnless you have already built a track record, you can't say that to investors \u2014 and believe me, it's not that simple even when you do have a couple exits under your belt. The more definitive your proof that revenue will be coming in, the better the chances you can raise (and not waste) investor funds.", "description": "Joe Procopio, a multi-exit, multi-failure entrepreneur, has worked with many startups.
