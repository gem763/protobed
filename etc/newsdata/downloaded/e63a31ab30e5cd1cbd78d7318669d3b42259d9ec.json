Jerry Brown is warning that the dark scenario may be \u201conly the beginning\u201d for Americans across the country \u2014 unless officials in Washington seriously tackle the issue of climate change.\n\n\u201cI said it was the new normal a few years ago,\u2019\u2019 Brown said in an exclusive interview with POLITICO. \u201cThis is serious .... but this is only the beginning. This is only a taste of the horror and the terror that will occur in decades.\u2019\u2019\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAnd it will occur in various spots: in America, in Africa, in Canada,\u2019\u2019 said Brown, who will travel to Washington this week to speak on climate change issues. \u201cIt\u2019s unpredictable, other than the fact that it will get worse in present trajectory. Washington, under Trump, is doing very little \u2014 and even the Congress has been unable to mobilize under Washington.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real threat, but it has to be managed. This is the world we live in. And it will get more dangerous.\u201d\n\nNorthern California grappled again this weekend with widespread power outages that affected as many as 2 million Californians, a preemptive effort by Pacific Gas & Electric to avoid sparking another massive wildfire after its wires started the state's deadliest conflagration last year.\n\nThe shut-offs, which began in the middle of last week and persist Monday, may not have been enough. One of the biggest fires of the year has engulfed popular wine areas in Sonoma County and forced mass evacuations from vineyards to the coast. The Kincade Fire began last Wednesday near where PG&E says it suffered a wire failure around the same time.\n\nBrown, the former four-term governor of California, last month inaugurated a UC Berkeley think tank specifically focused on tackling the climate crisis in partnership with China. His California-China Climate Institute aims to encourage partnerships between policymakers, academics and researchers in California and Tsinghua University.\n\nBrown and his wife Anne Gust Brown live on his family\u2019s ranch in Colusa, about 60 miles north of Sacramento and 120 miles from San Francisco. While much of rural Northern California had its power shut off this past week, the Browns aren't sitting in the dark, and don\u2019t expect to be affected by the outages \u2014 in part because they prepared for just this moment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re off the grid. We have solar collectors and lithium-ion batteries, so we\u2019re set,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe have a well. We collect rainwater and put it into the underground cistern.\u201d\n\nBut he says he is concerned for millions of Californians who aren\u2019t so lucky. Such widespread outages are \u201cdangerous\u201d for California, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t notify many people\u2019\u2019 when power is out, compounding the threat to residents in many communities. On the other hand, \u201cexperts say not turning off the power is dangerous,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cSo you\u2019re damned if you do, and you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHis advice to state residents facing down outages: \u201cGet ready\u2026.of course the state government and local governments, with the Office of Emergency Services, are doing a lot,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cBut they have to do more. People have to be mobilized; it\u2019s not just the government. Whether it\u2019s prescribed burnings or making your house more secure, knowing what your point of exit is, this is serious. \u201c\n\nAsked whether such events are the result of climate change or PG&E\u2019s mismanagement \u2014 as Gov. Gavin Newsom has said recently, Brown said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always had climate cycles \u2014 and sometimes very long droughts, but what we know is that climate change will exacerbate and make this more likely, more often.\u201d\n\nCalifornia officials \u201chave to be worried about PG&E, because if they go under \u2014 then what?,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cAnd we need a centralized authority to manage the stuff. \u201c He said some solutions that would control the problem, like undergrounding of wires, \u201care going to cost money, it\u2019s going to take leadership \u2014 and it\u2019s not business as usual.\u201d\n\nPG&E said this month it would take a decade for the utility ensure that its wires are fireproof, until which residents may be forced to face continued blackouts during dry, windy conditions such as those experienced this month.\n\nNewsom said Sunday at a Petaluma evacuation center, \"There is a plan to get out of this. This is not the new normal. This is not a 10-year process to deal with this. That will not be the case... They will be held to account to do something radically different.\n\nPG&E shareholders, bondholders and hedge funds are jockeying over control of the company as it tries to emerge from bankruptcy after sparking last year's Camp Fire, which virtually destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people.\n\nAnother option: Cities such as San Francisco and San Jose are contemplating taking over the utility. But Brown said that may not be an easy solution.\n\n\u201cIf you take over PG&E, your gas prices will turn into taxes \u2014 and politicians are very sensitive to that,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cIt\u2019s complex...you have to look at it from a non-ideological point; anybody who is rushing to take over the power business may not understand the full difficulty of what the 'new normal' actually is.\u201d\n\nAngela Hart contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a real threat, but it has to be managed.
