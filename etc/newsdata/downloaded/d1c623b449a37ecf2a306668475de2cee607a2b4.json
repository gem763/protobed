REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\n(Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s rand was slightly firmer against the U.S. dollar on Monday after \u201cproductive\u201d Sino-U.S. trade negotiations helped forge a cautious, risk-on mood.\n\n* The rand traded at 14.9150 versus the greenback, as of 0513 GMT, 0.13% stronger compared with its overnight close.\n\n* While a deal still looked elusive following talks between the United States and China last week, both sides later published positive statements and the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office described the talks as \u201cproductive\u201d.\n\n* However Peregrine Treasury Solutions said in a note that while the rand was firmer than a session\u2019s low reached overnight, it was still starting the week on the \u201cbackfoot\u201d as investors waited for more clarity over the U.S.-China talks. Shares across Asia also slipped on Monday.\n\n* \u201cThere is very little support for the currency between [its current] level and R15.00 and a range of R14.86 to R14.98 is on the cards for Monday,\u201d Peregrine\u2019s note said.\n\n* Government bonds strengthened, with the yield on benchmark 2026 instrument dipping 1.5 basis points to 8.280%.", "description": "South Africa's rand was slightly firmer against the U.S. dollar on Monday after \"productive\" Sino-U.S. trade negotiations helped forge a cautious, risk-on mood.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432868169&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0FE-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
