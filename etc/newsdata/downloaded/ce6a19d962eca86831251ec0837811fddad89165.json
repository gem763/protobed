It\u2019s the NFL. This isn\u2019t pee-wee football.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots have outscored opponents 76-3 so far, and Brady has played every snap. Gase also applauded that (clearly he\u2019s buttering up Bill Belichick), but said he thinks repetitions in a game matter, regardless of score.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s how I look at this,\u201d Gase said. \u201cIt\u2019s the second week of the season. The way that our league is structured now, those in-game reps are really valuable. Everything that you do in a game, especially at the beginning of the year, it\u2019s going to help you get better for the mid-part to the end of the season.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what we get to do at practice per week and training camp, how (little) contact that you have, the spring and all those types of things. These in-game reps whether you\u2019re up, down, whatever it is \u2014 they\u2019re all important. So, if you get in this situation, you want to keep playing. Because those are going to be valuable four or five weeks down the road. I mean, there really is value to that.\u201d\n\nSo even if Luke Falk isn\u2019t able to lead his team to a win (or even to a cover of a 23-point spread), Gase can at least take comfort knowing he is providing value.
