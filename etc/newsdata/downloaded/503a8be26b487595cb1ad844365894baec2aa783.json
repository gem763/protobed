The Trump Sons Have Plenty Too", "language": "en", "text": "Both sons have operated and promoted the Trump family business overseas during their father\u2019s presidency, even as he retains ownership. And while the Trump and Biden father-son relationships differ in many ways, the business dealings have set up a simple parallel.\n\n\u201cThey are criticizing the vice president\u2019s son for doing exactly what they are doing themselves,\u201d said Martin Ford, a member of the Aberdeenshire Council in Scotland, which voted last month to approve a proposal by the Trumps to build a 500-unit housing development. \u201cThey are conducting international business here in Scotland.\u201d\n\nEric Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, said there was a distinction between his father\u2019s career in business, with his recent turn to politics, and Mr. Biden\u2019s decades in public office.\n\n\u201cWhen my father became president, our family stopped doing international business deals,\u201d he said, a reference to a pledge by the Trump Organization not to begin new overseas projects during the Trump presidency. Hunter Biden, he said, did the opposite when his father became vice president.\n\nThe Trump business activities in India, Indonesia and Scotland were considered in compliance with the pledge, according to the company\u2019s ethics rules, because they were building on deals already in the works.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s campaign declined to comment on Friday. But in a tweet, the former vice president once again suggested that the attacks on his son were part of a political smear campaign. \u201cLet me make something clear to President Trump: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how dirty the attacks get.\u201d", "description": "The Trumps have criticized Hunter Biden for doing business overseas while his father was vice president.
