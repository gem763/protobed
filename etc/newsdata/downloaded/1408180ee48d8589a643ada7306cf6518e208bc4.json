fire, Syria\u2019s Kurds may turn to Damascus", "language": "en", "text": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 A US withdrawal from Syria\u2019s northern border this week has exposed Washington\u2019s Kurdish partners to a Turkish assault, creating conditions for a rapprochement with Damascus that both sides need badly, analysts said.\n\nThe main US partner in the years-long battle against the Islamic State group, Kurdish forces were left to fend for themselves after allied US forces pulled back on Monday.\n\nWhat the Kurds resent as a US betrayal paved the way for a Turkish operation that has seen Ankara bombard positions since Wednesday and send forces across the border.\n\nWith little leverage left in the game, Syria\u2019s Kurds \u2014 viewed by Ankara as \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2014 may have to thaw ties with President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Russian-backed regime.\n\n\u201cThe absence of US forces could cause them to turn to Damascus for assistance,\u201d Syria expert Samuel Ramani told AFP.\n\nMarginalised for decades, Syria\u2019s minority Kurds carved out a de facto autonomous region across some 30 percent of the nation\u2019s territory after the devastating war broke out in 2011.\n\nAfter the Islamic State group swept across the region in 2014, the Kurd-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) mounted a fierce defence of their heartland and became the US-led coalition\u2019s main partner on the ground.\n\nMiddle East analyst Jean-Pierre Filiu argued that the leadership of Turkey\u2019s outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) \u2014 of which the SDF is an offshoot \u2014 was paying a price for two misjudgements.\n\n\u201cIt believed its political project could take root in Syria without clearly antagonising the Assad regime, and it thought it could build a lasting alliance with the United States thanks to the anti-jihadist fight,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the short term, according to Alexey Malashenko of the Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute, the Kurds should expect no help from Damascus to fight off Turkey.\n\n\u201cAssad cannot give it to them for fear of harming relations between Moscow and Ankara,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kurds have already opened talks with Damascus on a long-term rapprochement but negotiations have stalled over outstanding issues, including the form of government in Kurdish regions and the future of forces stationed there.\n\n\u2013 \u2018A bitter pill\u2019 \u2013\n\nDamascus, which has accused the Kurds of treason over their alliance with Washington, rejects their self-rule and wants central government institutions restored in Kurdish-held areas, especially in the oil-rich east.\n\nIn comments published Tuesday, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad said Damascus was ready to welcome the Kurds back into the fold but stressed the government would not relinquish control over \u201ca single pinch of dirt\u201d in the war-torn country.\n\nWaddah Abed Rabbo, editor-in-chief of the pro- government Al-Watan newspaper, said the Kurds would have to disband their fighting force as part of a rapprochement.\n\n\u201cThey have to hand over all their heavy weapons to the Syrian army\u2026 and return to the military\u2019s ranks so they can fight Turkey\u2019s incursion together,\u201d he wrote in an editorial.\n\nExperts say these demands may be hard for the SDF to accept.\n\n\u201cThe SDF does not want to reconcile with Assad on terms placed down by Damascus, which would amount to surrendering their autonomy,\u201d said Nicholas Heras, an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n\u201cTurning to Assad might work to keep Turkey at bay, but it would be a bitter pill for the leadership of the SDF to swallow.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Resources and reconciliation \u2013\n\nDespite this, Turkey\u2019s invasion has bolstered calls for deeper engagement from both the Kurds themselves as well as the regime and its Russian backers.\n\nMoscow on Thursday said it would \u201cpush to get contacts going between Damascus and Kurdish organisations\u201d to calm the situation on Syria\u2019s northern border.\n\nFor its part, the Kurdish administration has said it \u201clooks forward to Russia playing the role\u2026 of a backer and guarantor\u201d in talks with Assad\u2019s regime.\n\nIn a statement carried by state news agency SANA on Wednesday, Syria\u2019s foreign ministry said it was ready to \u201cembrace\u201d Syria\u2019s Kurds if they chose to \u201creturn to their senses\u201d.\n\nAfter successive Russia-backed victories against rebels and jihadists since 2015, Assad\u2019s regime controls some 60 percent of the country.\n\nBut resource-rich areas in eastern Syria, essential for the regime\u2019s supply of oil, water and wheat, remain under Kurdish control.\n\n\u201cOn a strategic level, Russia and the Syrian regime stand to benefit the most from (Turkey\u2019s) operation,\u201d said the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of forcing the Kurds to move to a deal that allows President Bashar al-Assad to reassert control over the resource-rich east are immense,\u201d it said.\n\nAs Washington prepares its exit, the Eurasia group predicts the \u201cKurds will rebalance and allow Assad\u2019s forces to incrementally expand in the east\u201d.\n\nFaced with Turkish fire and difficult demands by Damascus, the Kurds are seemingly stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\n\u201cAny solution will likely not be on the Kurds\u2019 own terms, because they don\u2019t have leverage\u201d Ramani said.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 A US withdrawal from Syria\u2019s northern border this week has exposed Washington\u2019s Kurdish partners to a Turkish assault,",
