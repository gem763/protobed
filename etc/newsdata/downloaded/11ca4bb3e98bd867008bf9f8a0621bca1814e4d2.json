A psychologist prescribed the drug after diagnosing him with autism spectrum disorder. In late 1993, the drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating schizophrenia and episodes of bipolar mania in adults.\n\nAlso on rt.com Johnson & Johnson gets $572mn slap on wrist for causing opioid crisis in Oklahoma\n\nFour years ago, a jury awarded Murray $1.75 million after finding that J&J was negligent in failing to warn consumers of the risks. A state appeals court upheld the verdict last year, but reduced it to $680,000.\n\n\u201cThis jury, as have other juries in other litigations, once again imposed punitive damages on a corporation that valued profits over safety and profits over patients,\u201d Murray\u2019s lawyers, Tom Kline and Jason Itkin, said. \u201cJohnson & Johnson and [subsidiary] Janssen chose billions over children,\u201d they said.\n\nJ&J said the award was \u201cgrossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award in this case, and the company is confident it will be overturned.\u201d It added that the jury in the case had not been allowed to hear evidence of Risperdal\u2019s benefits.\n\nPlaintiffs claim that Johnson & Johnson failed to warn of the risk of gynecomastia (the development of enlarged breasts in males) associated with Risperdal, which they say J&J marketed for unapproved use with children.\n\nAlso on rt.com Companies people love to hate: World\u2019s most despised corporations\n\nPlaintiffs in the mass tort litigation had been barred from seeking punitive damages since 2014, when a state court judge ruled that the law of New Jersey (which prohibits punitive damages and is J&J\u2019s home state) should be applied globally to the cases.\n\nIn 2018, a Pennsylvania Superior Court ruling cleared the way for punitive damages awards, holding that the law of each plaintiff\u2019s state should instead apply.\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section", "description": "Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay man $8 BILLION over drug causing him to grow breasts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d9d986120302769506c62b0.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
