He\u2019s having a scan as a precaution,\u201d England scrum coach Neal Hatley told a news conference on Monday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s walking around with a smile on his face - but it\u2019s nearly lunchtime so he\u2019s happy.\u201d\n\nWith England already safely through, and preparing for a game where defeat would be anything but a disaster, coach Eddie Jones is unlikely to take the slightest risk on Vunipola - the one player in the squad where there is no real direct cover.\n\nMark Wilson would be the likely replacement and, though he has had an excellent year and is a fearsome tackler, he does not possess the ball-carrying skills of Vunipola.\n\n\u201cWe plan for all eventualities and we have played a lot of rugby without the Vunipolas,\u201d Hatley said, with reference to Billy\u2019s brother, Mako, who has barely played since injuring his hamstring badly in May.\n\n\u201cBilly is an important figure for us, but other people pick up the slack - we\u2019ve got like Ellis Genge, Mako Vunipola, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes and Kyle Sinckler.\u201d\n\nHooker Jamie George has also developed into a dangerous open-field runner and said Jones had talked to the team about the changing situation at halftime against Argentina.\n\n\u201cEddie made us aware of it, giving us a bit more responsibility to carry the ball more,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe French pack are massive so it\u2019s a different challenge \u2013 maybe similar to Tonga in terms of pure weight - and we are aware of that threat.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s only other injury worry concerns prop Joe Marler but initial concerns that he had damaged a hamstring proved unfounded. \u201cHe has done training this morning and he has played a lot of rugby for us and it\u2019s a position we have good strength in, and we will see how he pulls up to make sure we put out the strongest team possible,\u201d Hatley said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of (pain) referral in his back and we will see how he is tomorrow.\u201d\n\nJones will name his team on Thursday for Saturday\u2019s match and it would surprise nobody if he kept his cards close to his chest about both injured players until the team sheet is published.", "description": "England are awaiting the outcome of tests on Billy Vunipola's injured ankle ahead of their final World Cup pool clash with France on Saturday but are comfortable that others can step into the ball-carrying void should the number eight not make it.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437941137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF96079", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
