Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\nThompson will be nine months removed from a torn left anterior cruciate ligament in April, at which point the Warriors aren\u2019t comfortable risking re-injury by playing the All-Star guard before he\u2019s 100 percent healthy. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019s going to play this year,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSo we have to understand that.\u201d\n\nThompson had surgery July 2 and said he is targeting a return after the NBA All-Star break in February. Kerr knows where Thompson stands having suffered the same injury while in college.\n\n\u201cYou have to look at it realistically,\u201d Kerr told NBC. \u201cI had an ACL (tear) in college, and I missed a whole season. Generally, an ACL for a basketball player is a full-year recovery, and if it\u2019s a full year for Klay, that puts them out for the season.\u201d\n\n\u2014Detroit Pistons forward Blake Griffin will miss the start of the season because of hamstring and knee soreness that will be re-evaluated in the first week of November, the team announced.\n\nGriffin earned his sixth All-Star nod last season, when he averaged a career-high 24.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 75 games, his most in a season since making 80 appearances for the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2013-14 season.\n\nGriffin, 30, is entering his second full season with the Pistons after being traded from the Clippers in late January 2018. The oft-injured big man has career averages of 21.9 points, 9.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists in 604 games.\n\n\u2014Zion Williamson\u2019s weight did not cause his knee injury, New Orleans Pelicans vice president of basketball operations David Griffin said.\n\nWilliamson will be sidelined up to eight weeks with a torn meniscus in his knee. The 6-foot-7, 280-pounder could return as soon as six weeks, the team said Monday.\n\n\u201cThe notion that this happened because Zion is in poor condition is asinine,\u201d Griffin said before the Pelicans opened the season at Toronto. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in poor condition when he went 12 of 13 last week. That\u2019s not what it is. He\u2019s just a very unique body type and certainly from a physics perspective.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Jordan isn\u2019t ready to put Steph Curry in the Hall of Fame, though the two-time NBA Most Valuable Player and three-time NBA champion has averaged 23.5 points, 6.6 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nJordan, a five-time MVP who won six titles with the Chicago Bulls, appeared on \u201cToday\u201d and refused to walk back comments in 2013 that he would be unbeatable in a pickup game and offered a list of players he felt would help him be impossible to beat. He said Hakeem Olajuwon, Magic Johnson, Scottie Pippen and James Worthy were the only names on that list.\n\n\u201cSo, Steph Curry shouldn\u2019t be offended when he watches this,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI hope not. He\u2019s still a great player. Not a Hall of Famer yet though. He\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\u2014Kyle Kuzma could return to the Los Angeles Lakers soon despite missing Tuesday night\u2019s season opener against the Clippers with a stress reaction in his left foot.\n\nKuzma was cleared for noncontact practice last week and is officially day-to-day, Lakers coach Frank Vogel said in ruling Kuzma out for the first game of the regular season.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just talking about ramping up his activity, and we\u2019re not going to look past two days from now,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to increase his workload and activities this week, and we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Klay Thompson is unlikely to play this season, Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr told NBC Sports Bay Area.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443933629&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M026-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
