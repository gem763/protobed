(Information subscribers will get access as well.)\n\nApparently the app was inspired by the Briefing section of The Information website, which offers quick summaries (often drawn from reporting by other publications) of major tech news.\n\nTicker, meanwhile, will include a section called Today with summaries of the day\u2019s tech headlines \u2014 similar to Briefing, but written for a consumer audience. It will also include a calendar highlighting upcoming IPOs, conferences and other events that readers might want to know about. (Not included: The Information\u2019s full articles and original reporting.)\n\n\u201cMore and more, we\u2019ve been hearing from readers who don\u2019t have a business reason to follow tech but are finding it more and more central to their lives,\u201d Lessin said in a statement. \u201cWe are launching Ticker for them \u2014 giving them access to the best summaries of the most significant news, written by our team at The Information.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to launch Ticker later this fall. In the meantime, you can sign up here.", "description": "Since it was founded by journalist Jessica Lessin in 2013, The Information has stood out in the tech news landscape for its focus on an ad-free, subscription-driven business model (a focus that seems increasingly prescient).
