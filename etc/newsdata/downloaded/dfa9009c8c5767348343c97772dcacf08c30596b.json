Ms Elbaz was arrested by the FBI in 2017 and charged with fraud, ahead of being indicted on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the court judgement said.\n\n\"The conduct that formed the basis of those charges bears similarities to the conduct of AGM Markets, OT Markets and Ozifin,\" ASIC submitted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatching a KAB\n\niSignthis was also quizzed about its relationship with Tradologic, \"which material available on the internet\" suggested had engaged in \"unlawful activity\".\n\niSignthis replied that the relationship extended to being a sales referral partner and platform partner for its Know Your Customer service, and that it undertook a \"simplified\" due diligence process. It said it did not earn revenue from this partnership.\n\nSeparately, iSignthis expanded on a previous explanation for its banking relationship with KAB, or K\u00f8benhavns Andelskasse, which was a Danish co-op bank shut down by regulators and subsequently investigated for breach of anti-money laundering laws.\n\niSignthis was \"not in a position to attract interest from larger banking entities as its revenues were modest at that stage\" and \"KAB was prepared to move swiftly in order to secure the company\u2019s business\".\n\nThe company only became aware of the issues at KAB to a limited extent on September 16, 2018, iSignthis said, in response to a question about why it only disclosed supply chain issues to the market on September 26, 2018.\n\niSignthis confirmed it has no details of the 26 suspicious activity alerts which The Australian Financial Review reported were triggered by payments in and out of the KAB bank account of iSignthis in June and July of 2018.\n\n\"Even if they did exist, [iSignthis] has not received any notice from any government agency regarding the matter,\" the company said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing of the KAB transactions coincided with the escalating revenue hurdles linked to the issue of performance shares.\n\nThe latest disclosures also reveal the shifting composition of industries using the customer authentication, payment and settlement services provided by iSignthis.\n\nIn the December half of 2018, iSignthis' revenue was sourced exclusively from so-called 'regulated' industries such as financial services and currency and derivative trading.\n\nHowever, only 31 per cent of its customers were in the finance and trading industry in the September 2019 quarter, with the majority of its revenues now sourced from servicing e-commerce, travel, consulting and online gaming.\n\nManagement confidence\n\niSignthis has achieved a $1 billion valuation on account of its rapid revenue growth. The company's management and its largest instutitional shareholder, LHC Capital, have expressed confidence in the business model and its ability to satisfy regulators.\n\nLast week, company management presented to clients of Goldman Sachs' technology conference and said neither management nor the board were concerned by any of the regulatory queries so far received.", "description": "iSignthis may have facilitated up to a hundred million dollars of transactions on behalf of banned trading firm OT Capital in the space of a month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6637%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_104%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78f8715d138badeedaad57ab640a475ee415602b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
