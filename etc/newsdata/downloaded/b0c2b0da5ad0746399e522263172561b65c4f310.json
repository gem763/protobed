According to MacRumors, Kuo expects the successor to Apple\u2018s popular budget device will arrive in Q1 2020, or approximately four years after the original model. It will also arrive at a genuinely midrange price of $399, placing it in direct competition with the likes of Google Pixel 3a.\n\nKuo believes the SE2 will come with the same A13 CPU as the iPhone 11, 3 GB of RAM, and 64GB or 128GB of storage. As with the original SE at the time, the device appears to sport surprisingly powerful internals that basically match the company\u2019s flagships for performance. Apple instead seems to plan to cut costs with things like the display and cameras instead.\n\nAs much as some iPhone owners would like for Apple to retain the tiny iPhone 5 shape of the iPhone SE, it appears the SE2 will instead look a lot like the iPhone 8, bezels and all. This is corroborated by a Bloomberg report from September.\n\nStill, if the pricing pans out, it could be an excellent affordable option for iOS fans who don\u2019t care too much about having the fanciest display or triple cameras.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F04%2FiPhoneSE10TNW.jpg&signature=249abc1bbc85ca929eaca1b9f610ef7b", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
