Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) subtly reminisced her days as a registered Republican. She answered a question about a \u201csurprise\u201d friendship that impacted her and her beliefs by talking about her relationship with \u201cdeeply principled Republican\u201d Charles Fried \u2014 who served as Solicitor General from 1985-1989 \u2014 and her three brothers, two of whom are Republicans.\n\nCandidates at the Ohio Democrat debate on Tuesday were asked, \u201cWhat friendship have you had that would surprise us, and what impact has it had on you and your beliefs?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-seven years ago, when I was under consideration for a job,\u201d Warren began, mentioning Fried, whom she described as \u201ca deeply principled Republican.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was,\u201d Warren said.\n\nNotably, Warren was a registered Republican 27 years ago. She did not change her party affiliation to Democrat until 1996.\n\n\u201cBut he also was willing to listen to my work about what\u2019s happening to America\u2019s middle class, and Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure that I got the job,\u201d Warren continued before pivoting to her Republican brothers.\n\n\u201cYou know, I grew up out in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we\u2019re divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together,\u201d the presidential hopeful said.\n\nShe continued:\n\nWe want to see all of our children get a good start in life. We don\u2019t want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by health care. We\u2019re willing to get out there for the things we believe in. Look, people across this country \u2014 whether they\u2019re Democrats, independents, or Republicans \u2014 they know what\u2019s broken. They know that we have an America that\u2019s working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind. People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say, \u201cNo more. We want an America that works for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201c2020 is our moment in history. It\u2019s a deep honor to be here to be in this fight. I know what\u2019s broken. I know how to fix it, and we are building a grassroots movement to get it done that includes everyone,\u201d she concluded.", "description": "Sen.
