Maybe you need extra support for your back? Maybe you suffer from sleep issues? You might be pregnant\u2026 A full body pillow can do the trick and allow you to get better sleep at night, feel rested when you wake up and have more energy through out the day.\n\nIn this review we take a closer look at the\u2026\n\nSnuggle-Pedic\u2019s Memory Foam Full Body Pillow \u2013 Bamboo Memory Foam with Kool Flow Cover\n\n\n\nModel: Snuggle medic memory foam body pillow\n\nLength: 54\u201d just as long as my 7 year old daughter\n\n3 Key Features:\n\nVery comfortable memory foam body pillow\n\nMade of eco friendly foam, in the US\n\nKool flow cover\n\nGuarantee: Yes, 90 day sleep trial\n\nPersonally I\u2019ve been looking at the full body pillows for a while, I knew I wanted one to support my back while I sleep but couldn\u2019t decide which one was the best option. Sitting in front of the computer all day really wares on the back.\n\nWhen I got the offer from snuggle pedic to try their memory foam body pillow, I got excited. But must say I was a little skeptical, a memory foam body pillow, would that really work? Since I do the body pillow reviews here, they were nice to send me one so I could try it out.\n\nWhen I first received the box it was pretty small. How could they even fit a full body pillow in there? Turns out all the air was sucked out from it and it was rolled up in plastic. An environmental friendly way to ship it.\n\nWhen I got the plastic off, the pillow \u201cgrew\u201d and got surprisingly big. It was pretty heavy too.\n\nMy first impression was that the body pillow is very soft, the kool-flow cover has a nice feel to it. The memory foam gives a very comfortable feel when you push down on it or put your head on it.\n\nFirst impression was good, but the questions are\u2026\n\nWhat are the Benefits of the Body Pillow? Is the Body Pillow Comfortable to Sleep With? What Is the Pillow Made Of? Will the Body Pillow Hold Up? What Can the Body Pillow Help With? Pros and Cons The Company Behind the Product? Warranty\n\nNow I\u2019ve been using the Snuggle pedic body pillow for about a week, and this is my experience\u2026\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of the Memory Foam Body Pillow?\n\nBetter sleep \u2013 The memory foam, really adds a great feature to this body pillow, that alone made for better sleep. It is firm but very comfortable and it shapes after your body.\n\nI\u2019m a side sleeper, so I put the pillow under my head, tuck it between my knees and I still have plenty of pillow left\u2026 I\u2019m not very tall, but even if you are you will have plenty of pillow since it\u2019s about 54\u201d long. With this body pillow I sleep like a baby.\n\nEase pain \u2013 I must say it took a couple of days but my back does feel a lot better. The support from the pillow has made a big difference. I feel like my spine is lined up in a straight line much better then with just sleeping with a pillow under my head and another one between my knees. I see that others have gotten relief from neck, hip, leg and knee pain as well.\n\nPillow mountain\u2026 gone\u2026 \u2013 Before I used to have a mountain of pillows in the bed, to my husband\u2019s delight that is no longer the case. I\u2019m happy with just one pillow now. Although that\u2019s a big full body pillow, it\u2019s a lot easier to keep track of.\n\nFamily time \u2013 not sure about you but me and the kids enjoy cuddling up watching movies together, this is the perfect family pillow, all three of us can use it at the same time when we tuck it behind our backs. Husband still wants his space.\n\nClick Here for Best Price of the Snuggle Pedic Body Pillow!\n\nIs the Snuggle Pedic Body Pillow Comfortable to Sleep With?\n\nThis pillow is very comfortable to sleep with. The memory foam keeps the pillow firm and I have not (yet at least) experienced that it has gone flat. I saw a tip though if the pillow does go flat you can put it in the dryer, so that it regains it\u2019s firmness.\n\nWhat Is the Pillow Made of?\n\nIt\u2019s made out of Biogreen memory foam and CertiPur-U.S. certified foam. This is a proprietary mix of foams and that makes the pillow keep it\u2019s form.\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe cover is a kool flow bamboo cover made out of visose of bamboo, polyester and percenta lycra. The kool flow is for cool sleep. Right now it\u2019s spring and I must say that the pillow keeps cool. I will give you an update when summer is here and it\u2019s hot outside, that\u2019s when the kool flow will get a \u201creal\u201d test.\n\nThe cover is very soft and comfortable. All though the pillow is washable, you can\u2019t take the cover off. It doesn\u2019t come with an extra cover but this is something that you can purchase with the pillow.\n\nGetting a separate pillowcase for your snuggle medic body pillow will help keep it clean. You can get one here.\n\nIf you purchase the body pillow and the body pillowcase at the same time you will receive an additional 25% off the pillow case.\n\nWill the Memory Foam Body Pillow Hold Up, Hold It\u2019s Firmness?\n\nI have only used the body pillow for about a week, but so far it keeps its firmness. Since it\u2019s so long, and I tuck it between my knees I have to fluff it in the middle ones in a while.\n\nIf it does loose it\u2019s firmness, you can put it in the dryer. It will help if the pillow starts getting lumpy or saggy as well.\n\nWhat Can the Snuggle Pedic Body Pillow Help With?\n\nHere are a few things that a body pillow can help with:\n\nBack pain\n\nSciatica\n\nHip pain\n\nJoint pain\n\nLeg pain\n\nPregnancy aches\n\nBetter sleep\n\nClick Here for Best Price of the Snuggle Pedic Body Pillow!\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nVery comfortable\n\nCan help ease back pain and other pain issues\n\nWill help with spine alignment\n\nStays cool\n\nAllergy friendly\n\nWashable\n\nMade in the US\n\nCons\n\nDoes not come with an extra cover (you can now purchase one though)\n\nIt\u2019s big and take up some room in your bed\n\nWhat About the Company Behind the Product?\n\nThe company behind the Snuggle Pedic memory foam pillow is Relief Mart, a US based company out of CA. They are a BBB, A+ accredited business.\n\nIf you have any questions you can reach them at tel: 18006671969\n\nWarranty\n\nWhat Happens if I Don\u2019t Like the Pillow?\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the snuggle pedic body pillow you have a 90 day sleep trial guarantee, you can return it and get your money back. Even better they will customize the pillow for you\u2026\n\nThis is the response I got from Rick, from Relief Mart:\n\nSince we actually make the pillows with all U.S.A. made materials in our Southern California plant, if someone does not like the firmness, overall feel or support, they can not only return the pillow within the 90-day period, but we will actually customize the pillow to suit their exact requirements at no cost whatsoever (we even pay the shipping back and forth)!\n\nGuarantee does not get better than that!\n\nWhat Happens if the Body Pillow Break?\n\nIf it would break or you have any issues with it down the road, you have a 20 year limited warranty.
