(AP) - Veteran center Jonas Valanciunas chuckled at the idea the revamped Memphis Grizzlies are in a rebuilding process that could take a couple of seasons.\n\n\u201cWe can make it in one year,\u201d Valanciunas said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be successful, it\u2019s on us now to work, give everything on the court, off the court as well. Everybody talking about rebuilding and this and that, we just got to do it ourselves. We just got to play hard, do everything that we need to do, and we can go. Goal is to be good now.\u201d\n\nThat may be a tall order for a team anchored by a pair of 20-year-olds in Jaren Jackson Jr. and Ja Morant and a first-year head coach.\n\nThis is a nearly a completely different roster after the Grizzlies shredded the final ties to their past during the offseason, demoting their last general manager to scout duties and firing coach J.B. Bickerstaff hours after last season ended. Zach Kleiman, the executive vice president of basketball operations, revised the roster in a flurry of deals, including seven trades with the biggest sending Mike Conley to Utah.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing to win,\u201d Kleiman said.\n\nThey also benefited from draft lottery luck rarely seen since this franchise relocated to Memphis. The Grizzlies went from possibly sending their first-round pick to Boston to fulfill a 2015 deal for Jeff Green to their highest selection in a decade at No. 2.\n\nMemphis selected the Murray State point guard in Morant to replace Conley and pair with Jackson, the fourth overall selection a year ago. The Grizzlies also have a new coach in Taylor Jenkins.\n\n\u201cA lot of first time people around here,\u201d Jackson said of his second NBA coach. \u201cSo that kind of energy is infectious \u2026 He\u2019s straightforward. What you see is what you get. And he\u2019s a very excited person. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know about the revamped Grizzlies who open the season Oct. 23 at Miami:\n\nNEW COACH, NEW STYLE\n\nJenkins is the Grizzlies\u2019 fourth head coach since Memphis reached the 2013 Western Conference finals, and he coached the team without either Jackson or Morant to the Summer League title. Jenkins was Mike Budenholzer\u2019s assistant in Milwaukee and for five seasons in Atlanta. The Grizzlies insist they are committed to Jenkins, and he wants Memphis to play a motion-style offense with pace and space, clearing everyone to take 3s.\n\n\u201cI really hope the fans are excited about it even though we\u2019ve got a lot of new players,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThe new style play will be something that they can really latch on to, and every night whether they\u2019re coming to games and watching at home they\u2019re excited by what they see.\u201d\n\nGRIZZLIES\u2019 NEW DUO\n\nFor years the Grizzlies\u2019 key players were center Marc Gasol and Conley. Now their future solidly is in the hands of Jackson and Morant, a couple of talented 20-year-olds. Grizzlies guard Dillon Brook said Morant and Jackson have so much potential, and he\u2019s already been impressed by the rookie.\n\n\u201cHe looks amazing,\u201d Brooks said of Morant. \u201cHe looks like Derrick Rose. Whatever you guys are saying in the media is exactly what he looks like. He\u2019s going to be a great player to watch.\u201d\n\nJenkins has Jackson, Morant and Valanciunas as sure starters. The coach also wants Morant playing fast and aggressive, not looking over his shoulder worried that Jenkins thinks he\u2019s making too many mistakes.\n\n\u201cI want him to go full bore, and at the end of the day he\u2019ll figure out what kind of player he is going to be with his long career ahead of him,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nVETERAN HELP\n\nValanciunas isn\u2019t the only veteran on this roster. The Grizzlies also brought in guard Tyus Jones, Jae Crowder, center Miles Plumlee and Solomon Hill. Kyle Anderson also is back from shoulder surgery that ended last season after 40 starts for Memphis.\n\nINJURED\n\nValanaciunas is recovering from a sore foot from training camp but is expected to be ready for the opener. Forward De\u2019Anthony Melton could be out up to two months recovering from a stress reaction in his back in an injury announced late last month.\n\nWHITHER IGUODALA\n\nYes, the Grizzlies and Andre Iguodala agreed that the veteran should stay away. He remains on the roster until the Grizzlies either receive an offer they can live with or are forced to make a roster move.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Veteran center Jonas Valanciunas chuckled at the idea the revamped Memphis Grizzlies are in a rebuilding process that could take a couple of seasons.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Teresa M.
