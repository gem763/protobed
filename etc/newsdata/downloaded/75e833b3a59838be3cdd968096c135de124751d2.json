USA TODAY\n\nWhen Fox News' anchor Shepard Smith announced his resignation from the conservative-leaning network, many shocked viewers had a big question on their minds: Who's going to replace him?\n\nAccording to Variety, a slew of familiar Fox faces will fill Smith's 3 p.m. ET/PT block until the network nails down a permanent path forward. The report was confirmed to USA TODAY by a Fox spokesperson familiar with the situation.\n\nThe rotating cast of anchors will include Bret Baier, Chris Wallace, Brit Hume, Shannon Bream, Martha MacCallum, Bill Hemmer and John Roberts. Trace Gallagher anchored the show Monday afternoon.\n\nFox News Media president and executive editor Jay Wallace told Variety the network likely will fill Smith's former time slot next year with a news hour led by a different anchor. Wallace added the network is open to hiring an established Fox staffer or someone outside the company for the job.\n\n\u201cThis is going to remain a solid news hour, with our best news stars\" he said. \u201cJournalism is a huge part of the mandate here.\u201d\n\nFox News host Shepard Smith photographed on Jan. 30, 2017.

These are sharp people. Why do you want to parade this in front of everyone?
