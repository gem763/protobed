Smith House Intelligence Committee members call on Giuliani to testify\n\nA Democrat and a Republican on the House Intelligence Committee reiterated Sunday that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should testify before Congress, days after he refused to comply with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn interviews with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said that Giuliani was key to understanding pressure the Trump administration placed on the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family, while Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) said testimony from the former New York mayor would be helpful.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI would say at the very center of this whole ugly episode of the use of military aid and the White House meeting in an effort to get an investigation into Joe Biden and to get Ukraine to interfere in our election is Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Himes said. \u201cRudy Giuilani has refused to appear before the committee, but he is at the very core of this question.\u201d\n\nHurd agreed: \u201cI \u2026 want to know who did Rudy Giuliani actually talk to. I think having Mayor Giuliani come and testify is important.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyer also got some harsh words from retiring GOP Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida, who said recently he would be open to impeachment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy having an amateur diplomat \u2014 quasi diplomat out there \u2014 disrupt the work of our paid professionals,\u201d Rooney told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nHimes added that the investigation could still continue without Giuliani and said that Speaker Nancy Pelosi would like to wrap up the impeachment inquiry by the end of the year.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to tie Trump to Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Although Hunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president, there is no evidence that either of them did anything improper.\n\nLast week, former and current administration officials voiced concern about Giuliani\u2019s pressure campaign. And Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, is expected to testify Tuesday before congressional investigators. Rooney told CNN that Taylor\u2019s interview would be key.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard so far is quite troubling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite troubling that we had a diplomatic outreach of civilians delegating our paid public servant diplomat.\u201d\n\nGordon Sondland, President Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, told House investigators last week that he did not agree with the president\u2019s directive to contact the former New York mayor to discuss Ukraine. He added that Giuliani sought to tie a White House visit with Ukraine\u2019s new president with requests that the Ukrainian government investigate the Biden family.\n\nTrump\u2019s former top Russia adviser, Fiona Hill, also testified last week that she raised concerns about Giuliani with White House officials, including then-White House national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nAdministration officials did not directly criticize Giuliani\u2019s work on Sunday.\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton never complained to me about it, no one at NSC ever complained to me about anything that was going on,\u201d Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo also declined to criticize Giuliani\u2019s efforts to dig up dirt on Biden, stating on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos\u201d that \u201cprivate citizens often are part of executing American foreign policy.\u201d\n\nPompeo acknowledged that Giuliani provided him with a dossier of information related to the Ukraine, but said that he never reviewed the information. Pompeo further defended the administration\u2019s handling of the removal of Maria Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine after Trump allies accused her of being disloyal. Yovanovitch told Congress she was removed over \u201cunfounded and false claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe still works at the State Department, she\u2019s a foreign service officer in good standing,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cYou know this, George. Ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the president, and when a president loses confidence in an ambassador, it\u2019s not in that ambassador, the State Department or America\u2019s best interest for them to continue to stay in their post.\u201d\n\nMike McKinley, a former adviser to Pompeo, told congressional investigators that he resigned over Trump\u2019s attacks on Yovanovitch, and reportedly urged Pompeo to issue a statement about Yovanovitch. But Pompeo said Sunday he received no such request.\n\n\u201cNot once \u2026 did Ambassador McKinley say something to me during that entire time period,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nRepublicans also reiterated their criticism of the way Democrats are conducting the impeachment inquiry. Pompeo said it was \u201cdeeply unfair\u201d that State Department lawyers were not allowed for officials\u2019 closed-door testimony, while Hurd said that Republicans on the committee were not getting enough information after the depositions and that minority staff were not given the same level of access to the meetings as Democratic staff.\n\n\u201cMy concern is with the information the committee has access to after these depositions are done,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cThe evidence that is given in those meetings has not been made fully available to Republicans.\u201d\n\nHurd further said that if there was evidence of a quid pro quo between the White House and Ukraine, he wanted to know what it was for.\n\n\u201cWas it for the investigation of the previous election? Or was it to get dirt \u2026 for 2020?\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard yet. We haven\u2019t heard from any Ukrainian official that felt like there was this arrangement.\u201d\n\nBut Himes said that Republicans were focusing on the impeachment process to avoid discussing Trump\u2019s actions. He added that eventually the information in closed-door hearings would become public.\n\n\u201cAn investigation doesn\u2019t happen in the light of day, but I will tell you that there will be open hearings,\u201d Himes said. \u201cThis will all ultimately be all out there for the American people to see.\u201d\n\nThis report first appeared on politico.com on Oct. 20, 2019.", "description": "A Democrat and a Republican said the president's personal lawyer, who has refused to cooperate in the inquiry, should appear before the panel.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0e/6b/83119de344b999643a7e5d500ec3/former-mayor-of-new-york-city-rudy-giuliani.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
