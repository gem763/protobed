Single-stream recycling can often give consumers the impression that their one yellow bin will solve their problems, but that\u2019s far from the case.\n\nSingle-stream contamination remains a glaring issue\n\nAccording to Tori Carle, a Waste Reduction Supervisor in Greensboro, North Carolina, single-stream recycling can be less transparent, in part due to the containers themselves. Carle said that carts used in single-stream recycling are often concealed with a lid; recycling collectors are prevented from seeing what\u2019s inside and manually separating non-recyclables from recyclables.\n\nAs Five Thirty Eight writes, in a single-sorting system, a recycling truck may also compact and smash materials together. If you put a non-recyclable in your bin, scanners at your local materials recovery facility might have difficulty sorting these items out.\n\nAnd when you combine things in one bin as part of a single-stream system, soiled items might impact other recyclables; a wet tin can might soak paper and render it non-recyclable, as Mother Jones writes. (Let\u2019s emphasise one point, however: Throwing non-recyclables in a recycling bin within a dual-stream recycling system is still bad; it\u2019s that single-stream already has existing contamination issues.)\n\nPhoto: Spencer Platt, Getty Images\n\nWhen in doubt, throw it out\n\nWhat can you do to avoid this altogether? Simple \u2014 do an online search for your suburb\u2019s recycling program\u2019s rules and look for any recent headlines; recycling programs are changing rapidly in response to China\u2019s ban and fluctuating demand for recyclables. \u201cResidents should seek out recycling information when they are confused or when in doubt, throw it out,\u201d Carle said.\n\nThere are a few universal rules you should keep in mind, however. You probably can\u2019t recycle any heavily soiled items, for instance. As Mother Jones writes, items like plastic bags and electronics usually can\u2019t be recycled as part of your council program, either, and might require you to visit a drop-off location.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still having trouble, find a local Facebook group in your area devoted to sustainability; they can likely steer you in the right direction so you can make the best possible decision for the environment.", "description": "If you\u2019ve ever stood in front of your recycling bin \u2014 unsure if the trash in your hands is recyclable \u2014 and threw it in anyway, this article is for you....", "authors": ["Spandas Lui", "Tooran Alizadeh", "Edward Helderop", "Tony Grubesic"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/xjhvfui3o7drv5jyzqhu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
