During that lengthy period it progressed so far as you believed almost to fruition.\n\n\u2018You are an ordained priest in the Catholic church.\n\n\u2018I do not impose a more severe sentence for that reason but it goes without saying, although I do say it, that your words and actions and intentions seem to me to be wholly inconsistent with the teachings of the Catholic church and you have done nothing but a great disservice to the church.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the sentencing, Detective Constable Louise Murphy praised the work of the task force which brought the predatory priest to justice.\n\nShe said: \u2018Through his online communications it was clear to see that he was sexually attracted to young children and would do whatever he could in order to fulfil his own sexual gratification.\n\n\u2018I would like to take this opportunity to thank the undercover law enforcement officers who have been instrumental in building the case against Jolley.\n\n\u2018This case shows how well agencies can work together in order to protect the most vulnerable people in society. It also sends a clear message that anyone who commits such offences are not above the law and they will be brought to justice, regardless of who they are and what they do.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
