It\u2019s set on a collision course with Tokyo and the wider Kanto region, which is set to experience record-breaking rain and winds. The storm made landfall on Saturday evening, having been downgraded beforehand to \u201cstrong,\u201d the JMA\u2019s level for typhoons just above a severe tropical storm.\n\nMore than five million evacuation advisories have so far been ordered up and down Honshu\u2019s south coast, with residents taking shelter in crisis centres amid rising flood levels and violent winds which have left one man dead.\n\nIn the Greater Tokyo Area, wards have been issuing evacuation instructions \u2014 the strongest form of advisory used in Japan. More than 432,000 residents in the Edogawa Ward were told on Saturday afternoon to move to emergency shelters, with 214,000 houses in the area susceptible to flooding. Evacuations have also been ordered in Kawasaki, one of the city\u2019s main districts.\n\nRoughly 57,000 houses have been left without electricity in and around Tokyo, while buildings in the Kansai region, home to cities such as Osaka and Kyoto, have been damaged by floodwaters.\n\nThe first fatality of the storm was reported on Saturday morning. According to NHK, Japan\u2019s national broadcaster, a man from Ichihara, a city in Chiba Prefecture, was killed when his vehicle was flipped over. The man was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\nFears have been raised that the storm, which is generating gusts of up to 145mph, could match the fury of the 1958 Kanogawa Typhoon, one of the deadliest on record, which killed more than 1,200 people when it hit Japan\u2019s Shizuoka Prefecture.\n\nWith the worst-hit areas of Honshu set to be deluged by close to three feet of rain in a 24-hour period, the JMA has issued emergency warnings of flooding, mudslides and storm surges as high as 42 feet along the coast. Tokyo is predicted to see two feet of downpour.", "description": "A magnitude 5.7 earthquake has jolted the main island of Japan as Typhoon Hagibis, one of the strongest storms to hit\u00a0in decades, continues to reap\u00a0devastation throughout the central region of the country.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/12/11/typhoon-hagibis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
