The service sector has been strong,\" he said. \"Our labor market is in quite a strong position.\"\n\nTrump on Friday renewed his attacks on Powell, whom the president promoted to Fed chairman last year, denouncing both 2018's interest rate increases and the pace of cutting so far this year.\n\n\"Where did I find this guy Jerome?\" Trump asked on Twitter.\n\nBut in Zurich Powell reiterated that he and his Fed colleagues ignore such comments when they set monetary policy.\n\nCongress created the Fed to operate as an independent body.\n\nPowell also rejected the suggestion that the Fed could seek to oppose Trump's reelection by temporarily undermining the economy.\n\nWilliam Dudley, a top former Fed official, caused a considerable stir last month by publicly suggesting the Fed should do just that.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Powell said. \"Political factors play absolutely no role in our discussions.\"\n\nHe also reiterated the Fed's cautious position on Facebook's proposal to introduce a new digital currency, saying the approval process would not be a \"sprint.\"\n\nGiven Facebook's global penetration, \"it could be systematically important right away,\" he said.\n\n\"And because of that it would have to be held to the highest regulatory expectations.\"", "description": "The US central bank is ready to step in to preserve the American economy's expansion amid mounting risks, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday.
