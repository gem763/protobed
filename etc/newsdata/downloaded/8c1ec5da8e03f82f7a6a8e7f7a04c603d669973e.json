Knight Frank reported a house on Mount Nicholson, at The Peak, sold for HK$538.9 million (US$68.8 million), or HK$85,188 per square foot, and another on Tai Tam Road sold for a district record of HK$99,335 per square foot.\n\nThe prices show the fundamentals are still in place, says David Ji, director and head of research and consultancy for Knight Frank in Greater China.\n\n\u201cHong Kong\u2019s real estate market is not easily replaced, because other cities can\u2019t quite match the gap between supply and demand, even with ongoing protests,\u201d Ji says. Although the unrest has caused a nominal drop in prices, people who have been looking at the market for a long time may perceive the softness as a signal to buy, he says.\n\nOverall, Hong Kong\u2019s real estate market is stable and may actually rise a small amount for 2019, Ji adds. That\u2019s because residential real estate prices rose in the first half by an average of 8% to 9%, which should offset an estimated home price decline of 5% to 6% by the end of the year.\n\nAllan Lee, managing director of Hong Kong-based real estate investment fund Pamfleet, echoed the sentiment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s business as usual,\u201d Lee says. \u201c It\u2019ll take time to wind down, but it\u2019s not as bad as people read and see.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, he has the following advice for investors.\n\nConsider Investing in Retail or Office Properties\n\nThe residential sector gets the most attention in the city because a lack of supply has pushed prices higher, but there are opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThe market for retail properties, for ins tance, isn\u2019t all doom-and-gloom, despite government data showing a 23% year-over-year drop in retail sales in August. Although retail rents have been severely impacted (Prada, for example, is closing its prime location in Causeway Bay when its lease expires next year), Colliers reported that three new shopping malls have opened recently, injecting new life into the market, and that Hong Kong should remain a top shopping destination despite near-term market turbulences.\n\nRetail activity is down from a high point, Lee says, \u201cBut it went a bit crazy in the past. If you compare it to the rest of the world, it isn\u2019t down. It\u2019s suffering, but retail goes through cycles.\u201d\n\nLee, however, suggests exercising more caution with smaller retail transactions, where competition is higher against cash-rich local investors who can quickly execute transactions.\n\nThe strongest sector today is office real estate, particularly in the city\u2019s financial center, as Hong Kong\u2019s central business district (CBD) is still one of the most expensive places in the world to do business due to a shortfall of Grade A office space. According to a Knight Frank report on the office market in 2020, the government has unveiled plans to increase long-term supply with a second CBD, but the specific timeline is still unclear, and the supply-demand imbalance continues.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens between Hong Kong and China, there will always be that demand\u201d for office buildings. \u201cHong Kong is a financial market. It\u2019s a service provider economy, not a country that produces or makes anything. The CBD is small, and it\u2019s really the only place in China with a free-flow of capital.\u201d\n\nSearch for Value-Add Opportunities\n\nBecause the most active players in Hong Kong\u2019s real-estate market tend to be local investors and institutions, the months-long protests have put a stop to most activity in the city. But that doesn\u2019t mean prices have changed. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing many price adjustments. Nobody is willing to lower prices because of what\u2019s happening,\u201d Lee says.\n\nSo the best bets are investments that add value to older properties. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s real estate market is mature,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are a lot of old buildings and it\u2019s very densely populated, so if you can find something you can renovate and upgrade, it may be a good value.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t Speculate\n\n\u201cHong Kong is not really a core market like London or Tokyo\u2014it\u2019s very volatile and highly liquid,\u201d Lee says. That\u2019s because real estate investors in the city always have made most of their profit from capital appreciation.\n\n\u201cInvestors tend to want quick ins and quick outs,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThat\u2019s been driving Hong Kong\u2019s recent real estate value[s], rather than long-term growth.\u201d With the protests, the situation is changing on a daily basis, making it an especially dangerous time to speculate\u2014and a likely reason why many local investors have adopted a wait-and-see approach.\n\nUltimately, there may be some changes to the norm going forward, but Lee says China is not putting too heavy a hand on Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIf China\u2019s going to be here for [the] next 10 to 20 years, so is Hong Kong,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s merely a question of how long the protests will last, because Hong Kong is part of China.\u201d", "description": "Home prices remain high, but investors can find opportunities in office and retail properties", "authors": ["Jennifer Wang"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-121639/social", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
