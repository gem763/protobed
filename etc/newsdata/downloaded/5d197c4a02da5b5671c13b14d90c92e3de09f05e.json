There have been a few studies before, but they have generally been on historical archaeological material rather than prehistoric material,\" co-author Dr Sophy Charlton, from the department of archaeology at the University of York, told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright University of York Image caption Dr Charlton, shown here sampling the plaque from ancient teeth, says raw milk might have been processed into cheese or some other dairy product\n\nLactose intolerance arises from the inability to digest the lactose sugar contained in milk beyond infancy. This means that consuming milk-based foods can cause uncomfortable symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea. However, many modern Europeans possess a genetic mutation which allows for the continued consumption of milk into adulthood.\n\nThis mutation affects a section of DNA controlling the activity of the gene for lactase - an enzyme that breaks down lactose sugar. However, previous studies of the genetics of Neolithic Europeans show that they lacked this mutation.\n\nDr Charlton said it was possible these Stone Age people were limiting themselves to small amounts of milk. \"If you are lactose intolerant and you consume very, very small amounts of milk, then it doesn't make you too ill. You can just about cope with that,\" she explained.\n\nBut Dr Charlton added: \"The alternative option, which I think is perhaps slightly more plausible, is that they were processing the milk in such a way that it's removing a degree of the lactose. So if you process it into a cheese, or a fermented milk product, or a yoghurt, then it does decrease the lactose content so you could more easily digest it.\n\n\"That idea fits quite well with other archaeological evidence for the period in which we find dairy fats inside lots of Neolithic pottery, both in the UK and the rest of Europe.\"\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The Neolithic saw the introduction of domesticated animals, such as sheep, cows and goats\n\nIn addition, some of the milk residues found in these pots appear to have been heated, which would be required for processing raw milk into cheese or some other product.\n\nThe human remains tested in the study come from three Neolithic sites: Hambledon Hill in Dorset, Hazleton North in Gloucestershire, and Banbury Lane in Northamptonshire.\n\nMore than one quarter of the pottery fragments at Hambledon Hill had milk lipids on them, suggesting that dairy foods were very important to the people living at that site. Other Neolithic sites show evidence of animal herds that are consistent with those used for dairying.\n\nGenetic studies of ancient populations from across Eurasia show that lactase persistence only became common very recently, despite the consumption of milk products in the Neolithic. The mutation had started to appear by the Bronze Age, but even at this time, it was only present in 5-10% of Europeans.\n\nThe Neolithic age in Britain lasted from about 6,000 to 4,400 years ago and saw the introduction of farming, including the use of domesticated animals such as cows, sheep, pigs and goats.\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "description": "Scientists discover the earliest direct evidence of milk consumption by humans.", "authors": ["Paul Rincon", "Science Editor", "Bbc News Website"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/23F4/production/_108740290_mediaitem108740289.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
