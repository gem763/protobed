The property for sale has a competitive price tag of \u00a3270,000\n\nThe swimming pool is surrounded by attractive decking and plants\n\nThere is plenty of space on the driveway for the vehicles of friends and family\n\nOutside, there is a large driveway, with enough space for three or four vehicles, and planning permission for an extension.\n\nThe garage comes with an up and over door, as well as lighting and plumbing. It also has a hydraulic ramp, which is perfect for the avid mechanic, according to Connells estate agents, which is handling the sale of the property.\n\nIt explains: 'The garden is very private and not overlooked and benefits from having the sun there all day.'\n\nThe swimming pool measures seven metres by four metres and is self-cleaning.\n\nThere is a spacious living room at the front of the house - complete with jukebox\n\nThere is a basic dining room at the back of the property, that doesn't give away the real star of the show\n\nA Zoopla spokesman said: 'As this property goes to show, private pools are no longer the preserve of the super rich.\n\n'As we head further into summer, this home will be sure to attract a lot of interest.\n\n'While we might not always enjoy the same amount of sunshine as the Med, this pool's retractable cover will ensure it can be enjoyed all year round.\n\n'And for those tempted to transform their own garden into a tropical paradise, the cost of building a pool can start at around \u00a325,000.'\n\nThe kitchen has white wall and base units with blue wall tiles, perhaps to go with the pool theme", "description": "At first glance, this property looks like a regular three-bedroom end of terrace, but there is a surprise leisure suite beyond the front door.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/11/16/15923750-0-image-a-28_1562857645294.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-12"}
