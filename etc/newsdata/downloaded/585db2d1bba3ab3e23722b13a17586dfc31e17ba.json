The matches go down as scoreless draws, eliminating the Italians and leaving them furious.\n\nItaly needed to beat New Zealand for the first time, and with a bonus point, to qualify from Pool B and while that was highly unlikely, Parisse argued they at least deserved a shot.\n\n\u201cIf New Zealand needed four or five points against us, it would not have been cancelled,\u201d he fumed.\n\nWhitelock claimed the All Blacks wanted to play but \u201cwe don\u2019t make those decisions -\u2013 it\u2019s come from higher up. Maybe ask those guys\u201d.\n\nThe long-serving Canterbury Crusaders lock has experienced the cancellation of Super Rugby matches because of tragic events \u2014 the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, in which 185 people died and the mosque shootings early this year which claimed 51 lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of Super Rugby games cancelled, with the earthquake and the shooting, and both those games you understand why. Rugby is just a small thing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSometimes the right thing is not playing. There would be nothing worse than if we did play and people were getting hurt. That\u2019s the right thing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve listened to advice from above and we can\u2019t change it, so we just have to play the cards that have been dealt to us.\u201d", "description": "Urayasu (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 New Zealand have rejected accusations of preferential treatment over their cancelled final World Cup pool match, with senior", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/ee789a_new-zealand-coach-steve-hansen-typhoon-cancellation-saturday-game-was-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
