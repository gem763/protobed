Add Interest\n\nZervos has alleged Trump \"repeatedly touched her, groped her, and kissed her\" on multiple occasions in late 2007 and early 2008, but he has denied it and called her a liar.\n\n\"To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago,\" Trump said in a 2016 statement. \"That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I\u2019ve conducted my life.\"\n\nNow, Zervos said there is corroborating evidence the Trump Organization was forced to turn over as part of her defamation lawsuit filed in New York Supreme Court earlier this year.\n\nMary Altaffer/AP, FILE\n\n\"In particular the Trump Organization has produced copies of Defendant\u2019s calendar entries and itineraries from late 2007 through early 2008 \u2013 the period in which Ms. Zervos reported she met with and was assaulted by Defendant,\" the court filing states.\n\nOne document that Zervos says she got from the Trump Organization to support her claims includes itinerary documents that show Trump flew from Las Vegas to Los Angeles on Dec. 21, 2007, and stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel for two nights, including when Zervos has alleged Trump \"grabbed and sexually assaulted her in his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow.\"\n\nZervos also included a copy of an email that she said was sent to the Fox News tip line with the subject line \"Trump hit on me.\"\n\n\"I was on the Apprentice. After the show was completed, Trump invited me to a hotel room under the guise of working for him. He had a different agenda. Please contact me to speak further as I have tried to make contact,\" the email stated, according to the court filing.\n\nThere is an additional piece of evidence Zervos is seeking, an unspecified nine-page document the Trump Organization has designated confidential. Zervos has asked the judge to force the Trump Organization to lift the designation.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"Defendant evidently is aware that the documents at issue closely corroborate Plaintiff\u2019s detailed account of their interactions,\" her court filing said. \"That is not a valid reason for Defendant to use the Confidentiality Stipulation to continue to conceal the truth.\"\n\nTrump's attorneys have not commented on the latest court filing.\n\nTrump faces a deadline of Dec. 6 to sit for a deposition in this case. In a ruling issued last week, the court ordered Trump to submit four possible deposition dates between now and then\n\nThe president argued unsuccessfully that the state had no jurisdiction over him to hear Zervos\u2019 defamation case. He had threatened to appeal to New York\u2019s highest court but has never followed through.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s own records", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/summer-zervos-donald-trump-gty-jc-190314_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
