But their math skills have limits.\n\nPreviously, scientists thought bees could only count to four, but new research suggests bees can understand quantities as great as five, provided they\u2019re trained with rewards and punishments.\n\nTests suggest fish are also thwarted by arithmetic thresholds. But it\u2019s not just small-brained animals. Human brains are similarly limited. Estimating quantities up to four is effortless for most people, but estimating larger quantities takes more concentration.\n\nUntil now, scientists thought bees were incapable of the focus necessary to comprehend larger numbers. However, the latest research showed that when bees are properly trained, they can process quantities as large as five.\n\nFor the study, scientists at RMIT University in Australia taught honeybees to associate specific symbols with specific numbers \u2014 much the way humans use numerals to represent different quantities \u2014 and to distinguish between lesser and greater values. The researchers reinforced the associations with a sugary solution, while wrong answers earned a bitter solution.\n\nFor half the test bees, scientists only rewarded correct answers. Incorrect selections earned no punishment. The other half of the test group received both rewards and punishments.\n\nEach bee was made to fly to the end of a Y-shaped maze to make their selection and fly back to their hive to share their sugary treat.\n\nBees that were only rewarded failed to distinguish between four and greater values, but bees that were rewarded and punished were able to distinguish between four and larger quantities. The properly trained bees even learned that five is greater than four.\n\n\u201cThus, bees\u2019 ability to learn higher number discrimination depends not just on their innate abilities, but also on the risks and rewards on offer for doing so,\u201d researchers wrote in The Conversation.\n\nScientists published the results of their tests this week in the Journal of Experimental Biology.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 Bees can count and understand the concept of zero.
