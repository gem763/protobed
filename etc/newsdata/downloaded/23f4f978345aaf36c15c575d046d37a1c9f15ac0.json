Who knows?\"When asked whether additional talks are scheduled to be held in two weeks as suggested by the U.S. State Department, Kim expressed doubts about whether Washington can bring alternative plans within that period.Before boarding a plane for Beijing in Moscow, Kim stressed that Pyeongyang has no desire to engage in \"sickening negotiations\" with the U.S followed by his statement right after the talks in Sweden that whether North Korea's suspension of the nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missiles tests will continue depends wholly on the U.S.North Korea has expressed its intent to dismiss engaging in denuclearization dialogues with the U.S. until Washington withdraws its hostile policies and added that the deadline for talks is the end of this year.The remark can be interpreted as the regime's willingness to ask the U.S. to lift international sanctions, while guaranteeing its security, as well as halting South Korea-U.S. joint military exercises and having Washington refrain from selling state-of-the-art weapons to Seoul.Kim Ji-yeon, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
