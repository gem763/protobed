The proposed ban would only allow the sale of tobacco-flavoured vapes.\n\nMore than a quarter of U.S. high school students used e-cigarettes in the past month, up from 20.8% of students last year, according to preliminary data released by the Health and Human Services Department on Wednesday.\n\nMarket leader Juul Labs Inc, which is 35% owned by Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc (MO.N), said this week the company has taken steps to reduce its appeal among youth.\n\nThe American Vaping Association, which advocates for cigarette smokers to switch to nicotine-based vaping devices, has blamed the illnesses on vaping illicit THC products.\n\nEarlier this week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed banning flavoured e-cigarettes, following a ban imposed in Michigan last week. San Francisco took the ban one step further in June, banning the sale of all e-cigarettes starting in 2020.\n\nE-cigarettes were introduced to the U.S. market more than a decade ago as an alternative for cigarette-addicted adults.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nSix deaths have been linked to vaping, and U.S. public health officials are investigating 450 cases of potential vaping-related lung illnesses across 33 states and one U.S. territory.\n\nNew Jersey has three confirmed cases of the mysterious lung illness attributed to vaping and is investigating 19 others, Murphy said.\n\nA nationwide investigation led by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not definitively linked the illnesses to any specific e-cigarette product or ingredient. Even so, health officials have expressed suspicions about the effect of inhaling vitamin E acetate, a substance contained in some THC vaping products.", "description": "Within weeks, New Jersey could become the latest state to restrict e-cigarette use, with the governor on Thursday launching a task force to find ways to curb vaping, linked by U.S. health officials to hundreds of respiratory illnesses and a half-dozen deaths.", "authors": ["Gabriella Borter", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429347267&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0HF"}
