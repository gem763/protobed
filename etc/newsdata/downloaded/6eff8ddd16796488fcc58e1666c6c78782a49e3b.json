But Japanese warplanes didn\u2019t actually fire the first shots that brought America into a massive Pacific War.\n\nAn hour before the air attack, a squadron of tiny Japanese midget submarines attempted to slip into the harbor\u2019s defenses, like burglars in the night, to wreak havoc on Battleship Row. Unlike the aerial assault, the sailors failed spectacularly \u2014 and the story is often forgotten.\n\nBy the 1930s, Imperial Japan and the United States were set on a collision course. Tokyo\u2019s decision to invade China in 1931 and intensify their brutal campaign six years had provoked ultimately irrevocable tensions.\n\nThe United States responded to the incursion into China with increasing sanctions, culminating with an embargo on petroleum in July 1941 that crippled the Japan\u2019s economy. Japanese military leaders had wanted to capture the Dutch East Indies to secure its oil wealth, but knew it would trigger war with the Unites States.\n\nWhile U.S.-Japanese negotiations came within striking distance of a peace agreement, Roosevelt was a hard bargainer, demanding Japan\u2019s leaders order a complete withdrawal from China. They refused.\n\nThus, Japanese Adm. Yamamoto began planning for a \u201cshort victorious war.\u201d The key to this idea was knocking out the battleships of the U.S. Pacific fleet at their home base of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii to buy the Japanese Army time to complete the conquest of the Western Pacific.\n\nAlong with a massive air strike from a Japanese carrier task force would constitute the main attack, the Navy coordinated the undersea assault using midget submarines.\n\nDuring World War II, Japan, England, Italy and Germany all employed midget submarines to stealthily infiltrate shallow, defended harbors and attack vulnerable capital ships. The Japanese Navy\u2019s midget submarines had hidden their developments by calling the ships Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki , or \u201cTarget A\u201d\n\nJapanese officials hoped the designation would deceive foreign analysts into believing the 78-feet long submarines were actually mock ships for naval gunnery practice. In reality, each of the 46-ton subs had a crew of two and was armed with two 450-millimeter Type 97 torpedoes with 800 pound warheads.\n\nThe little submarines could sprint up to 26 miles per hour submerged, but could not dive deeper than 100 meters. More importantly, the Type As had no engine and ran purely on batteries.\n\nThis gave the diminutive vessels a maximum endurance of 12 hours at speeds of 6 miles per hour. The subs often ran out of power much faster in real combat.\n\nAs a result, a larger submarine mothership had to bring the Type As close to the target area. Even so, the battery limitations made it unlikely the midget sub could make it back to safety. Each one had a 300-pound scuttling charge as a self-destruct device.\n\nJust getting to the designation was difficult enough. Since the small boats were difficult to control even while swimming in a straight line, crews had to manually move lead weights backwards and forwards to stabilize the vessel.\n\nWith these obvious issues, on Oct. 19, 1941, the Japanese Navy began modifying five Type A subs with improved pneumatic steering devices, as well as net-cutters and guards for fending off anti-submarine nets. Workers at the Kure Naval District painted over the submarine\u2019s running lights to help hide them from enemy spotters.\n\nAfterwards the midgets went to the Kamegakubi Naval Proving Ground and crews loaded them onto the backs of five large Type C-1 submarines, the I-16, I-18, I-20, I-22 and I-24. On Nov. 25, 1941, The motherships set sail for Pearl Harbor.\n\nWhile on route, the so-called \u201cSpecial Attack Unit\u201d received the coded message \u201cClimb Mount Niitaka 1208.\u201d This meant authorities in Tokyo had not found a diplomatic solution and signaled the go-ahead for the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nOn Dec. 6, 1941, the C-1s swam to points within 12 miles of Pearl Harbor. Then, between the hours of midnight and 3:30 A.M. the next day, the ships released their deadly payloads.", "description": "An hour before the air attack, a squadron of tiny Japanese midget submarines attempted to slip into the harbor\u2019s defenses, like burglars in the night, to wreak havoc on Battleship Row.
