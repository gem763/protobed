ETH price could spike below the $180 support in the near term.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nIn the past two days, ETH price made two attempts to surpass the $185 resistance against the US Dollar. However, bitcoin price struggled to climb higher above the $10,350 and $10,400 resistance levels. As a result, Ether price also started showing a few bearish signs below the $185 resistance. On the positive side, the price is holding the main $178 and $180 support levels.\n\nThe last swing low was formed near the $177 level. The price is currently correcting higher above the $178 and $179 levels. Moreover, there was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $185 swing high to $177 swing low. On the upside, the $182 level is currently protecting gains. Additionally, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $182 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $185 swing high to $177 swing low is also acting as a resistance. If there is an upside break above $182, Ethereum price could revisit the $185 resistance level. To continue higher and start a decent rise, the price must break the $185 and $186 resistance levels.\n\nOn the upside, an initial support is near the $180 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The next key support is near the $178 level. If there is a downside break below the last swing low, the price could correct further lower towards the $170 support area in the near term.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price seems to be currently consolidating in a range below the $182 and $185 resistance levels However, if bitcoin price continues to slide, there are chances of a sharp downward move move in ETH below the $175 support area in the coming sessions.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is likely to move back into the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is currently above the 50 level, with a minor bearish angle.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $178\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $185", "description": "Ethereum price is struggling to gain strength above $185 versus the US Dollar since bitcoin is declining.
