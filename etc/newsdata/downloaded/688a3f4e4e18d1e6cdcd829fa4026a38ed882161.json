The star of The IT Crowd is instantly recognisable with her auburn hair and striking green eyes, as I\u2019m ushered into the room by a PR wearing a barrister\u2019s wig.\n\nIt was once the infamous Number One Courtroom, where Oscar Wilde, Mick Jagger and John Lennon stood trial, and is a perfect fit for her new BBC2 legal sitcom, Defending the Guilty, which starts today.\n\nWritten by Cuckoo\u2018s Kieron Quirke and based on the barrister and columnist Alex McBride\u2019s book Defending the Guilty: Truth and Lies in the Criminal Courtroom, this part procedural drama, part comedy has a sharp-edged message: that the current legal system is not about justice, but a game that is played to win.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cI sort of had aspirations of going into that world,\u201d says Parkinson, who stars as the cynical criminal barrister, Caroline. \u201cIt was quite an ethical choice to become a barrister. But also I was a fan of This Life in the Nineties,\u201d she says \u2013 a drama that, like Defending The Guilty, centred on the lives of law graduates launching their careers.\n\nParkinson\u2019s Caroline is the pupil mistress to idealist trainee barrister Will Packham (Will Sharpe) \u2013 roughly based on McBride \u2013 who is competing against three other pupils for a place in chambers.\n\nIt\u2019s a cut-throat world but from the offset, Caroline doesn\u2019t help to build Will\u2019s confidence by inappropriately calling him \u201cbaby boy\u201d, even \u201cmummy\u2019s bouncy boy\u201d; referring to herself as \u201cmummy\u201d when talking to him. When he objects \u2013 finding it, quite rightly, all a bit weird \u2013 she says matter of factly to him: \u201cBut mummy wants to call herself mummy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear there is a lot going on here that Freud could have had a field day with, which adds intrigue, even if it is not always laugh-out-loud funny \u2013 but, Parkinson adds, what attracted her to the script was that it is \u201ca credible insight into the current legal system\u201d, not just a comedy. It\u2019s fair to say then, based on watching the TV show, that the legal profession is pretty bonkers.\n\nSoon Caroline\u2019s naive prot\u00e9g\u00e9 wakes up to the reality that he isn\u2019t helping people in need, but mostly defending the guilty, while also running a lot of errands for Caroline, who gets him on the \u201ccrucial business\u201d of fetching her laptop lead from chambers and running to the shop for a cinnamon twist (she has a pastry obsession).\n\nShe gets the best lines. \u201cMike, I want to get you off. But we have fewer defence points than I have viable eggs.\u201d When she asks if there is a solution, he says, \u201cHave you considered freezing them?\u201d\n\nParkinson, of course, is best known for playing the technologically clueless head of the IT department, Jen Barber, in four series\u2019 of The IT Crowd from 2006 to 2013 \u2013 for which she received a Bafta TV Award in 2014. It also made household names of co-stars Richard Ayoade and Chris O\u2019Dowd.\n\nIn fact, it was O\u2019Dowd \u2013 who studied with Parkinson at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) \u2013 who suggested she audition for the role that gave her cult status.\n\nParkinson, who feels she \u201cgrew up\u201d on The IT Crowd, says she had to deal with a lot of tricky situations as a young actress in the world of comedy: \u201cI did feel like I was the one in heels and pencil skirt \u2013 and I did feel slightly like \u2018So hang on, where is my funny costume?\u2019\u201d she tells me about landing the role. \u201cBut generally I haven\u2019t been the actress who has to have sex appeal. That wasn\u2019t my way in. So I haven\u2019t had lunches with people who have tried to have sex with me \u2013 well, not that I\u2019m aware of! It was struggling to get your voice heard a bit, not always feeling like you could express yourself fully because you had to be attractive first.\u201d\n\nI press her on the issue of sexism in the industry. \u201cI think it\u2019s getting so much better, and then I think, \u2018Is that just because I\u2019m getting older?\u2019 I\u2019m probably less vulnerable to sexism. And as you get established, you are seen and dealt with on your own terms.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 10 most uplifting TV shows Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

There\u2019s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here \u2013 listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey\u2019s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn\u2019t, well, too fey. Kimmy\u2019s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years; rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there\u2019s still something rather inspiring about that. Eric Liebowitz/Netflix 2/10 The Good Life If you\u2019ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don\u2019t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good\u2019s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy. PA 3/10 Pride and Prejudice The work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC\u2019s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It\u2019s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle\u2019s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there\u2019s the lake scene \u2013 need I say more? Rex 4/10 Five gay American men do a makeover, and it\u2019s fabulous. That\u2019s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise \u2013 Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France dives into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming \u2013 and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they\u2019re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love. Austin Hargrave/Netflix 5/10 Gilmore Girls Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow \u2013 but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Netflix 6/10 Great British Bake Off Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There\u2019s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent \u2013 only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma\u2019s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and Sue/Noel and Sandi keeping things fun \u2013 even when the pressures on \u2013 there\u2019s never a mean-spirited moment. Channel 4 7/10 Bewitched Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that\u2019s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she\u2019s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it\u2019s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that\u2019s always enlivening to watch. Rex 8/10 Brooklyn Nine-Nine Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its diverse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can. Fox 9/10 Inspector Morse A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It's intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw's curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Rex 10/10 Friends Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends\u2019s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are \u2013 but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you're hooked, you'll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into \u2013 which is enough that by the time you're done, you'll be ready to start again.

Getty\n\nParkinson has just started filming the new Catherine Tate film, This Is Nan\u2019s Life, about Tate\u2019s foul-mouthed pensioner character, who first appeared in The Catherine Tate Show. It is being brought to the big screen for the first time, directed by the artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse, Josie Rourke. Little is known about it yet, apart from Tate starring as Joan \u201cNan\u201d Taylor and Mathew Horne reprising his role as the grandson Jamie.\n\nWhen we meet, she has recently finished a stint in Laura Wade\u2019s hit West End play Home, I\u2019m Darling. Parkinson\u2019s Judy lives as a 1950s housewife in the 21st century, who clings so desperately to the past that it was dubbed a giant metaphor for Brexit and won her a nomination for an Olivier Award in the best actress category.\n\nNow she is writing a secretive comedy drama for TV, which she will star in herself. \u201cI\u2019d rather not be in it but I think that is the idea,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI am really going to try and put a rocket up my arse to write it.\u201d\n\nShe got the ball rolling with her writing when she wrote her debut play, Sitting, as part of a BBC Arts first-time playwrights scheme. It had its premiere at the Arcola Theatre earlier this year, following a month-long run at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2018, where it largely got three-star reviews. The witty and sharp play follows three people having their portrait painted, who talk in monologues about love and loss. I wonder if it comes from her own experiences?\n\nShe lets out a loud laugh. \u201cI have experienced it like anybody else but wouldn\u2019t necessarily like to talk publicly about it,\u201d she says. Then she pauses.\n\n\u201cThe play\u2019s about suicide actually. Things like that aren\u2019t always things you are completely ready to talk about. But I think everybody has experiences of love and loss. Of people dying suddenly and mental illness. And the guilt that you feel if you haven\u2019t maybe been able to help people out of that. And all the rest of it.\u201d (She says there was a suicide in her family but she isn\u2019t ready to discuss it.)\n\nBut when she was approached to write the play her initial reaction was not to do it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it\u2019s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don\u2019t understand.

Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can\u2019t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.\" Netflix 22/30 Line of Duty (BBC) \"Plausibility is a spectrum; Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the individual. The shadowy government forces are elected; the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It\u2019s exhausting work, policing the police.\" BBC 23/30 The Virtues \"Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham\u2019s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\" Dean Rogers/Channel 4 24/30 Good Omens 'Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett\u2019s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.' Amazon Prime 25/30 Years and Years \"Years and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.\" BBC 26/30 Killing Eve \"As the series develops, it\u2019s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 27/30 Chernobyl HBO 28/30 The Handmaid's Tale Hulu 29/30 This Way Up Aisling Bea and Sharon Horgan in Channel 4 series 'This Way Up' Channel 4 30/30 Succession Brian Cox leads the Roy family in HBO knockout \u2018Succession\u2019 HBO 1/30 Doctor Who - New Year's Day special (BBC1) \u201cAs a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who \u2013 i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks \u2013 this is a New Year treat that more than delivers\u201d BBC 2/30 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2) \u201cBilly Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity \u2013 a \u201cProustian wander through Scotland\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.\u201d BBC/7Wonder/Jaimie Gramston 3/30 The Paras: Men of War (ITV) \u201cFrom the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men \u2013 and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male \u2013 involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.\u201d Jonny Ashton/ITV 4/30 Brexit: The Uncivil War (Sky Atlantic) \u201cDespite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn\u2019t simply flatter Cummings \u2013 the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.\u201d Nick Wall 5/30 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4) \u201cThe programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain; but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.\u201d Channel 4 6/30 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4) \u201cThis documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their guardians.

And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.\u201d Netflix 13/30 Shetland (BBC1) \u201cLike all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care.

Or Alayned, perhaps.\u201d BBC 15/30 Leaving Neverland (Channel 4) \"Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland\u201d AFP/Getty 16/30 Home (Channel 4) \"Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme \u2013 but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he\u2019s stray cat that\u2019s just wandered in.\" Channel 4 17/30 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC) \"A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando\u2019s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can\u2019t really add anything to that.\" PA 18/30 Derry Girls (Channel 4) \"It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man\u2019s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.\" Peter Marley 19/30 Fleabag (BBC) \"While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O\u2019Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.\" BBC/Two Brothers/Luke Varley 20/30 Road to Brexit (BBC) \"The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it\u2019s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don\u2019t understand. Rather, it\u2019s a very clever, very funny, very 'different' parcel of bollocks to Brexit.\" BBC 21/30 Our Planet (Netflix) \"The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can\u2019t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.\" Netflix 22/30 Line of Duty (BBC) \"Plausibility is a spectrum; Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the individual. The shadowy government forces are elected; the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It\u2019s exhausting work, policing the police.\" BBC 23/30 The Virtues \"Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham\u2019s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\" Dean Rogers/Channel 4 24/30 Good Omens 'Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett\u2019s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.' Amazon Prime 25/30 Years and Years \"Years and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters.

Then at the time, people were talking about not enough women writers and I felt like I had almost a moral obligation to try and not worry about it not being perfect. I am a busy working mum and don\u2019t have as much time as I would like in an ideal world \u2013 but I was like, \u2018Just get over yourself \u2013 try and do it\u2019.\u201d\n\nParkinson grew-up in Kingston upon Thames with her father, the historian Alan F Parkinson, her teacher mother and two brothers. She went to a grammar school, then studied classics at Oxford \u2013 where she found acting a relaxing tonic from all the academic work.\n\n\u201cI met these brilliant young people who had just played Cyrano de Bergerac at public school in their own theatres \u2013 and it was a bit of a shock. Obviously, it gives you more confidence in the acting profession if you come from that background. I had been to a state school where there wasn\u2019t a great amount of extra curriculum drama available.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t deter her as she won a scholarship to LAMDA \u2013 the only drama school she applied for. Does she think that the domination of actors from public school and Oxbridge in the acting profession is a problem?\n\n\u201cI was lucky to get a free education \u2013 even at university,\u201d she says. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen any more and it is hugely expensive. I feel very strongly that people will drop out of the profession early on unless they have private funds. It\u2019s people with money who can make the choice to turn down the regional theatre job because they are waiting on a TV job \u2013 but it isn\u2019t fair. It is something that drama schools are conscientiously trying to change through bursaries because we play people from all walks of life.\u201d\n\nParkinson left LAMDA early to star in a play, The Age of Consent, in 2002, with one review claiming her performance was \u201cnothing short of miraculous\u201d.\n\nBut after a very fallow period (\u201cI was in two plays back to back at The Gate and I was on \u00a3140 a week \u2013 not enough to live on\u201d), she was not far from giving it up and getting a proper job when she got her lucky break playing receptionist Pauline Lamb for three years in ITV\u2019s long-running medical comedy drama Doc Martin.\n\nThe rest is history and since then Parkinson, who now has two daughters, Gwendolyn, four, and Dora, six, has had to learn to navigate the work and home life balance as a mum. In fact, she started filming the sci-fi drama Humans in 2014 when Gwendolyn was six weeks old \u2013 leaving her actor husband Harry Peacock and parents to do the childcare \u2013 and look after Dora, who was then only 16 months old.\n\nShe was breastfeeding at the time and took an electric pump to work to express the milk. \u201cThe expressing didn\u2019t come naturally to me \u2013 because I am not somebody who wants to sit here with a machine making a noise while clamped to my breast and talking to men at work,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut I knew that I was only happy to go and do it if I could carry on breastfeeding. I\u2019m not saying everybody should breastfeed. For me, it meant the bond was there for the temporary leave of absence.\u201d\n\nThe crew who were mostly men went out of their way to make her feel comfortable because \u201cthe reality was I had to do it every two hours\u201d. \u201cThey were mostly dads and they knew what the situation was,\u201d she says. \u201cThe truth is I would have very happily stayed at home but couldn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t have the financial choice not to work.\u201d\n\nParkinson managed to complete eight episodes of Humans, \u201cbut to be honest it was part-time \u2013 I only worked 10 days a month,\u201d she says, although she notes that \u201cit was physically hard to go back to work so soon\u201d. She nearly turned the role down, \u201cfeeling guilty\u201d leaving her baby but her husband convinced her to play the role of Laura Hawkins, a mother of three trying to juggle family life with her career as a lawyer. The character chimed with her, but unlike Parkinson who could rely on her family for childcare, Laura finally gives in to getting a \u201csynth\u201d \u2013 called Anita, played by Gemma Chan, who acts as a robotic babysitter.\n\nDo actors think they have to drop out of their acting career when they have children or is it getting easier? \u201cIt is a feminist issue really. I have younger actress friends who talk about having to hide their pregnancy. And I think, \u2018Why should you hide your pregnancy?\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel I had to do that. But of course, that is because I wasn\u2019t always playing the crumpet in things.\u201d\n\nAll throughout her career, Parkinson has balanced TV and theatre jobs in what seems like the perfect balance. But she prefers the stage, \u201cnot least because it\u2019s at night time and it suits my body clock,\u201d she says.\n\nShe has appeared in many notable productions, including the Royal Court\u2019s 2007 adaptation of The Seagull, alongside Kristen Scott Thomas, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Carey Mulligan, and the 2009 play Cock at the Royal Court, with Ben Whishaw and Andrew Scott.\n\nOn TV, she played another powerful straight role alongside Maggie Gyllenhaal in Hugo Blick\u2019s political spy thriller The Honourable Woman, in 2014, as the pregnant Rachel Stein, who feels increasingly isolated from her family in a world of conspiracy and espionage. In Kay Mellor\u2019s pregnancy drama In The Club, also in 2014, she was Kim Hall, a mother with her own website, Kim and the Bump, offering advice for other expectant mums.\n\nThen in 2015 Parkinson starred in the BBC One comedy series The Kennedys, written by Emma Kennedy, about growing up on a Stevenage New Town estate in the 1970s. She has also appeared in comedy films such as How to Lose Friends and Alienate People (2008) and The Boat That Rocked (2009).\n\nThe only area Parkinson has left untouched is Hollywood. Would she ever take a role there now? \u201cIt\u2019s changing in an exciting way \u2013 there are lots more co-productions with America happening here. My personal reason for not going out there is that I don\u2019t want to take my children out of school,\u201d she says. \u201cI think what excites more me is doing a play on Broadway. I get more excited by New York than LA.\u201d\n\nDefending The Guilty is on tonight on BBC2 at 10pm", "description": "Katherine Parkinson is sitting in the corner of an oak-panelled former courtroom in a West End hotel.\u00a0The star of The IT Crowd is instantly recognisable with her auburn hair and striking green eyes, as I\u2019m ushered into the room by a PR wearing a barrister\u2019s wig.", "authors": ["Charlotte Cripps"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/15/katherine-parkinson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
