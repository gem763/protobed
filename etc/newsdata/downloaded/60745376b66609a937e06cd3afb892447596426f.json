Kingsway in Gloucester, the Whitehall Road area of Leeds and Liverpool city centre were also among the biggest improvers.\n\nImage caption Jaywick began as a holiday resort, with homes becoming permanent residences after World War Two\n\n\"I love where I live\"\n\nTo Dan Casey, Jaywick is a beautiful coastline and a community of people he loves to talk to.\n\nYet the 80-year-old, who sits as an independent on Tendring Council, is fed up that for the third time in a row his neighbourhood is ranked the most deprived in England.\n\nImage caption Dan Casey says Jaywick needs investment\n\n\"Something has to change or we will be here again in another few years,\" he said. \"It needs investment to bring in jobs.\n\n\"The biggest problem here is too many people are relying on benefits.\"\n\nThe latest data shows 57% of people in Jaywick are living in \"income deprivation\", meaning they are either not earning money or earning so little they have to have benefits to support them.\n\nHe said the economy has suffered ever since Butlin's closed its holiday camp in 1983.\n\n\"We've still got a stunning coastline,\" Mr Casey said. \"It's something we have to offer that a lot of other places don't. I was walking here recently, looking out and thinking it's gorgeous.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. I love my home and I love the people.\"\n\nAll of the local authorities with the highest proportion of deprived neighbourhoods are in the north - Middlesbrough, Knowsley, Hull, Liverpool and Manchester.\n\nMiddlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said: \"The challenges we face are really big and difficult to overcome, but we have big plans that will deliver real progress.\n\n\"Within the next three weeks we will be announcing game-changing developments that will help to deliver the economic growth that has been missing for decades.\"\n\nA government spokesman said: \"The government is committed to levelling across the country and with unemployment levels continuing to fall and wages rising at their fastest in over a decade, we're committed to supporting families with their cost of living.\n\n\"We're providing more support to the most deprived authorities, which now have a spending power 16% higher per home than the least deprived.\"\n\nYour questions answered\n\nWe asked you what you wanted to know about this story. Here are some of the most popular questions:\n\nHow is deprivation measured?\n\nEach neighbourhood gets a score based on seven different measures.\n\nIncome deprivation is one of the main ones.\n\nIt looks at the proportion of the population that is either out of work, or earning a low wage and receiving benefits.\n\nEmployment deprivation takes account of the working-age population that is out of work.\n\nThis could be due to unemployment, sickness or disability, or caring responsibilities.\n\nThe government also looks at the risk of premature death, whether there is a lack of skills, housing availability and the \"living environment\".\n\nThe last measure looks at things from quality of housing to air quality and road traffic accidents.\n\nOverall figures do not show whether things are getting better or worse, just how a neighbourhood compares to others around the country.\n\nIf a neighbourhood has moved down the rankings, it could mean that the area has become less deprived.\n\nHowever, it could also mean not much has changed for that place, but somewhere else has become more deprived.\n\nWhy are the majority all in the north of England?\n\nIn an accompanying report, MHCLG said the study revealed \"concentrations of deprivation in large urban conurbations, areas that have historically had large heavy industry manufacturing and/or mining sectors (such as Birmingham, Nottingham, Hartlepool), coastal towns (such as Blackpool or Hastings), and parts of east London\".\n\n\"There are also pockets of deprivation surrounded by less deprived places in every region of England,\" it said.\n\nHow large are the areas being counted as deprived?\n\nThe government divides England up into neighbourhoods with a similar population size so that they can be compared with one another.\n\nThey have an average of about 1,500 residents or 650 households each.\n\nWhat questions do you have about this story?
