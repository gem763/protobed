REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo/File Photo\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry told reporters on Tuesday at a nuclear power conference in Vienna the United States would only provide Saudi Arabia with nuclear power technology if it signed an agreement with a U.N. watchdog allowing for intrusive snap inspections.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia has resisted agreeing to strict nonproliferation restrictions, known as the gold standard, that would block it from enriching uranium and reprocessing spent fuel, potential pathways to making a nuclear bomb.\n\nSenators Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Perry urging the administration to discontinue recent talks with the kingdom about nuclear power development.\n\nThe lawmakers have been concerned about Saudi Arabia\u2019s reluctance to agree to the gold standard, after de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year his country does not want nuclear weapons but will pursue them if its rival Iran develops one.\n\n\u201cSharing nuclear technology with Saudi Arabia, especially without adequate safeguards, will give Riyadh the tools it needs to turn the Crown Prince\u2019s nuclear weapons vision into reality,\u201d said the letter from Markey and Merkley, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.\n\nThe State Department and Energy Department did not immediately comment.\n\nIn a Sept. 4 letter to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who was replaced by Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Sunday, Perry said an agreement on nuclear power \u201cmust also contain a commitment by the kingdom to forgo any enrichment and reprocessing for the term of the agreement.\u201d\n\nBut the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, did not clarify the length of the \u201cterm\u201d the kingdom would have to forgo those practices or whether it covered U.S. origin uranium or uranium from other countries.\n\nA nonproliferation expert said the administration wants to convey the idea it supports the gold standard, but the ambiguity means it remains unclear if it does.\n\n\u201cWhy would you even consider helping the kingdom build nuclear reactors after the attack on an energy facility?\u201d said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Washington-based Nonproliferation Policy Education Center. \u201cWhat makes you think building another energy facility that\u2019s radioactive is smart?\u201d\n\nPerry has said that if the United States does not work with Saudi Arabia, other suppliers such as China and Russia could help the kingdom develop nuclear power.\n\nBut some lawmakers say if China or Russia helped the kingdom develop nuclear power without adequate nonproliferation safeguards Washington has the tools to counter that.\n\nRiyadh plans to issue a multi-billion-dollar tender in 2020 to construct its first two nuclear power reactors, with U.S., Russian, South Korean, Chinese and French firms involved in preliminary talks.\n\nIn February, Markey and Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, joined lawmakers in the House of Representatives in introducing legislation that would increase congressional oversight over any civil nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia.", "description": "Two Democratic U.S. senators on Wednesday urged Trump administration officials to halt talks with Saudi Arabia on building nuclear reactors after weekend attacks that halved the country's oil output and increased instability in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431364915&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1WL", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
