House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has ruled that the Commons will sit tomorrow morning\n\nAs Axios' Shane Savitsky notes, the ruling means that the queen is in an awkward place as she approved the order to suspend Parliament based on advice from Johnson's administration.\n\nthe ruling means that the queen is in an awkward place as she approved the order to suspend Parliament based on advice from Johnson's administration.
