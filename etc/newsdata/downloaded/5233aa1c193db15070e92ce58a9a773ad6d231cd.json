The answer may lie in the movie's relentless manipulativeness,' he said.\n\n'Literal pain can't be transmitted from screen to audience, but anxiety can, and the production is a nonstop generator of anxiety, a poor substitute for dramatic intricacy. If you're feeling insufficiently anxious in your life, 'Joker' could be just the ticket. If not, look elsewhere to be entertained.'\n\nA.O. Scott, of the New York Times, was more scathing about the hype and controversy that was stirred up surrounding the film ahead of its release.\n\nHe referenced the concerns people had about the film's potential ability to stir up real-life violence and the director's counter-backlash of that argument.\n\n'We are now at the phase of the argument cycle when actual ticket buyers have a chance to see what all the fuss is about, which means that it's also time for me to say my piece. And what I have to say is: Are you kidding me?' he said.\n\nAn air of menace and a cloud of controversy accompany the arrival of the new 'Joker' movie with the portrayal of the most famous villain in comic book history being arguably the most chilling twist on the character in 50 years\n\n'To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it.\n\n'Joker,' an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity - as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage - the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance.'\n\nIt was described as a 'viewing experience of rare, numbing emptiness' by the New Yorker's Richard Brody.\n\n''Joker' is a wannabe movie that also wants to be all things to all viewers, that imitates the notion of adding substance while only subtracting it,' he wrote.\n\n'Phoenix, alternately brooding and exulting, dancing extravagantly in his underwear or in a resplendent costume or seething with rage, cringing with horror, or camping it up with an affected accent, isn't so much unhinged as unmotivated and, to all appearances, undirected.\n\n'What he delivers is less a performance than a display of his bag of actorly tricks - and they're pretty wonderful, but they adorn a character who's an empty framework, and, to all appearances, empty by design, for fear of alienating the target audience.'\n\nSince taking home the top prize of Best Film at the Venice Film Festival last month, critics have been quick to suggest the film struggles with a lack of substance\n\nJake Coyle, of the Associated Press, described it as a 'calculatedly combustible concoction, designed, like its chaos-creating character, to cause a stir'.\n\n'I wish it was as radical as it thinks it is,' he said.\n\n'Instead, 'Joker' is a mesmerizing, misjudged attempt to marry the madness of a disturbed individual to today's violent and clownish times. It's a shallow, under-examined movie that renders the dark descent of a troubled man with an operatic fervor.\n\n'Rather than surround Arthur\u00b4s horrifying transformation with context, alternatives or rays of light whether they fall on him or not 'Joker' simply hitches a ride on his freefall in mania.'\n\nPeter Bradshaw, of the Guardian, described 'Joker' as 'this year's biggest disappointment.'\n\nHe stated that Phoenix's portrayal could have had the same impact of Ledger's, more than a decade before, had it not have been for the 'realist detail and overblown ironic noir grandeur.'\n\nThe story 'loses your interest,' after the Joker character finally snaps in a 'terrible revenge bloodbath,' Bradshaw wrote. From there 'tedious and forced material' ensues with a 'supposed triggering of anti-capitalist, anti-rich movement.'\n\n'The film somehow manages to be desperately serious and very shallow.'\n\nOne critic wrote that Phillips' beaten-down-by-society version of Joker gave a justification of the character's transformation from clown to mass murderer, ruining all intrigue and leaving the audience to feel the change was 'inevitable'\n\n'It\u2019s predictable, clich\u00e9d, deeply derivative of other, better movies, and overwritten to the point of self-parody,' wrote Dana Stevens of Slate.\n\nShe felt the film was hard to watch, not for gore and cinematic violence, but instead due to 'claustrophobia and boredom.'\n\nStevens advised it was a film viewers should 'skip' in favor of other movies due to it not living up to its pre-cinema release hype.\n\nVanity Fair wrote that the film could be seen as 'irresponsible propaganda for the very men it pathologizes,' and suggested the film could be seen as giving justification to mass shooters.\n\nThey added that police would be stationed inside random movie theaters in both New York and Los Angeles to avoid anything like what happened at the screening of Batman Dark Knight Rises in 2012.\n\nThe incident in Aurora, Colorado, saw James Eagan Holmes kill 12 and injure 70 after setting off tear gas grenades and shooting audience members with multiple firearms.\n\nGlen Weldon, of NPR, thought that Phillips' greatest faux pas was stripping 'all the mystery' from the Joker character, citing historically how the villain's motivations for committing acts of violence were never fully understood.\n\nHe felt the titular character's transformation to a 'mass murderer' seemed 'inevitable' and 'not a choice; it's something the world does to him.'\n\n'It devotes so much of its energy into not being about a comic book villain that it neglects being about ... much of anything, really,' Weldon added.\n\nSome praised the tension built-up by Phillips' but felt the film missed an 'underlying sardonic bite' that many great hits before it, like Taxi Driver, showcased.\n\nDavid Sims of the Atlantic thought the film had all the 'pulpy origins' of Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but 'missed their underlying sardonic bite.'\n\nThe effort to bring realism to the Joker's story mean that Phillips 'lost his grasp on the character's symbolic purpose,' he wrote. 'Treating the audience to something undeniably visceral but also unacceptably shallow.'\n\nSims felt the violence turned the flick into 'little more than a horror show' and from there eradicated 'any chance at insight' into the character.\n\nCNET's Richard Trenholm praised how Phillips built tension and menace 'toward the inevitable explosion' but felt that without a clear-hero in the story 'it was hard to see the point.'\n\nHe added that instead of competing with films like Taxi Driver, it 'feels less like a genuine artistic statement and more like one of several cringy attempts to be edgy.'\n\nTrenholm wrote that the film was 'intense' and 'free of capes and other superhero nonsense' but that it lacked substance.\n\nHe highlighted that the films 'Joker' paid homage to were released 40 years ago and now 'maybe the joke isn't funny any more.'\n\nWe've had Jokers before, but this monstrously memorable creation does something the others couldn't: BRIAN VINER reviews Joker\n\nJoker\n\nVerdict: Brutal but brilliant\n\nRating:\n\nJudging by some of the more excitable reports about the release of this electrifying movie, you would expect it to come not just with an 18 certificate, rather than the 15 it carries, but also a public health warning.\n\nCertainly, it is dark, violent and disturbing enough for an 18, a triple-whammy that not everyone wants from a night out at the pictures.\n\nIt is also superbly conceived, written, directed and acted. Moreover, for a film with a comic-book lineage, telling the story of how Batman's arch-enemy came into being, it is refreshingly free of computer-generated effects.\n\nNor does Joaquin Phoenix, extraordinary in the title role, offer the standard caricature of super-villainy.\n\nComic-book movies often do terrific business at the box-office without ever turning the heads of those who dish out awards.\n\nJoker has already confounded that tradition. It deservedly won the main gong, the Golden Lion, at last month's Venice Film Festival.\n\nThat's where I saw it first, practically staggering from the cinema into the dazzling late-summer sunlight of the Venice Lido.\n\nJudging by some of the more excitable reports about the release of this electrifying movie, you would expect it to come not just with an 18 certificate, rather than the 15 it carries, but also a public health warning\n\nOn Monday, in London, I saw it again. The conditions couldn't have been more different; we were greeted afterwards by driving autumnal rain. But the impact was the same. The weather was the last thing on anyone's mind.\n\nJoker is a thunderously powerful character study of a man with a mental illness, and a ferocious indictment of a society that doesn't treat the mentally ill with the same compassion it shows to, say, cancer sufferers.\n\nThat might make it sound worryingly like a cinematic lecture, but it's not Ken Loach behind the camera, it's Todd Phillips, who directed the Hangover films. Joker is still an exercise in entertainment. Indeed, I have rarely been so grippingly entertained.\n\nPhoenix plays Arthur Fleck, who lives with his fragile mother (Frances Conroy) in a ramshackle apartment building in Gotham City. It is 1981. Gotham is New York City, blighted by crime, uncollected garbage and industrial unrest, in gossamer-thin disguise.\n\nA rich, ruthless industrialist called Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is campaigning to become mayor, to get Gotham back on its feet.\n\nThose of you who recall the Batman origin story should note that he has a young son called Bruce. If you also keep an eye on contemporary U.S. politics, you might wonder whether Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver used Donald Trump as their model.\n\nArthur, meanwhile, is just about holding down a job as a professional clown, available for cheap promotional stunts, children's hospital visits, that sort of thing.\n\nHe is disturbed, a loner with a Tourettes-style condition that compels him to laugh loudly and suddenly for no reason. He makes weekly visits to a social worker, who organises his medication, but Gotham's social services are being cut to the bone.\n\nSoon he will have nowhere to turn. 'The worst thing about having a mental illness,' he writes in his journal, 'is that people expect you to behave as if you don't.' Arthur dreams of being a stand-up comedian.\n\nHis hero is a TV talk-show host, Murray Franklin, splendidly played by Robert De Niro in a conspicuous nod to Martin Scorsese's 1982 satire The King Of Comedy.\n\nIn that film, De Niro himself played the deranged stand-up comic, who was obsessed with a TV host played by Jerry Lewis. So Phillips and Silver don't mind acknowledging their influences. Another great Scorsese movie, Taxi Driver, from 1976 is invoked, too.\n\nHis hero is a TV talk-show host, Murray Franklin, splendidly played by Robert De Niro in a conspicuous nod to Martin Scorsese's 1982 satire The King Of Comedy, writes BRIAN VINER\n\nYet Joker is luminously original in the background it weaves for one of comic-book fiction's greatest baddies, and in the way it does so. Boldly, it even dares to let us sympathise with Arthur. He is creepy, yes; but victimised and misunderstood. Even when he commits his first murders, he has the audience's empathy.\n\nIt is doubtful whether any actor of his generation could have inhabited the role quite like Phoenix does.\n\nThe late Heath Ledger's Joker, in The Dark Knight (2008), cast an extremely long shadow.\n\nBut I think Phoenix steps out of it. He has always been brilliant at conveying torment, for instance as Johnny Cash in Walk The Line (2005), and in The Master (2012), while of course he was a memorable villain in Gladiator (2000). That face helps; even in repose it looks slightly psychotic.\n\nGotham is teetering on the brink of civil strife and it turns out to be Arthur, of all insignificant citizens, who nudges it over the edge.\n\nThe man wanted for murder had a painted clown face, and suddenly clown masks are everywhere, a symbol of proletarian anger against Wayne and other masters of the universe.\n\nAs riots erupt in the streets, Arthur is assailed by a personal crisis. He learns startling details about the circumstances of his birth.\n\nPerhaps even more unexpectedly, he is invited to be a guest on The Murray Franklin Show, following the broadcast of a video of him dying, in comedic terms, in his stand-up debut.\n\nIt is the 1980s, so we can't say that his humiliation goes viral, but Phillips is clearly taking a pop at modern social media.\n\nLike The King Of Comedy, Joker is a satire; an unforgettably brutal and brilliant one. So never mind, for the time being at least, the warnings that it could have a dangerous effect on already troubled minds.\n\nRight now, everyone involved should be hugely proud of their creation, especially Phillips and Phoenix, but also executive producer Bradley Cooper.\n\nThe last film his production company made was A Star Is Born (2018). This one, the first in a new franchise called DC Black, an offshoot from the DC Extended Universe series, could be subtitled A Supervillain Is Born.
