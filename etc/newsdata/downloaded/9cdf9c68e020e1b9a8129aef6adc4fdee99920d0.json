Stand up, fight back!\"\n\nOthers shouted out the names of migrant children who had died in federal custody.\n\nAnother group of protesters held up a banner saying \"hate is not normal.\"\n\nMcAleenan tried to start his remarks several times before trying one last time, saying he wanted to go \"above the politics and the daily news cycle\" to talk about challenges in immigration policy.\"\n\nHe was shouted down, though some of the other audience members appeared to ask the protesters to allow McAleenan to speak.\n\nAs protesters continued to chant, McAleenan threw his hands up in the air, said, \"OK, thank you,\" and left.\n\nActivist groups said they disrupted the speech to prevent McAleenan from having a platform to \"spread hatred.\"\n\n\"No Trump henchmen should be given a platform to spread hatred or defend the racist, xenophobic policies put into place by Donald Trump and Stephen Miller,\" said Nicole Regalado, the campaign director of CREDO Action, one of the groups that disrupted McAleenan's speech. \"Institutions that elevate the architects and enforcers of Trump's hate and normalize that cruelty can expect to hear from us.\"\n\nMore: President Trump talked about shooting migrants, using alligators at the border, according to new book\n\nMore: Trump's plan to cut aid to Central America could push more migrants to come to US\n\nIn a statement later Monday, the Department of Homeland Security criticized the protesters for not allowing a \"robust dialogue\" with the acting secretary and released the text of his planned remarks.\n\n\"Unfortunately the Acting Secretary and the audience did not get the opportunity to engage in a robust dialogue this morning due to the disruptions of a few activists,\" the department said. \"The Acting Secretary thanked the organizers and returned to work protecting the Homeland and American values.\"\n\nThe acting DHS secretary has been controversial for his implementation of the Trump administration's immigration policies, though he has signaled discomfort with some of those policies.\n\nIn an Oct. 1 interview with The Washington Post, McAleenan said he was losing a battle to prevent the department from becoming overtly politicized and said the administration's controversial child separation policy \"went too far.\"\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan takes the podium at an immigration law and policy conference, Monday, Oct. 7, 2019 in Washington.
