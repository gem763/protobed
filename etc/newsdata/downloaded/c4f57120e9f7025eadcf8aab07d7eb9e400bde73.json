He has a white chocolate face with milk chocolate eyes, little sugar shell chocolates dotted along his body, and white chocolate shoes.\n\nThe wildly different original Colin the Caterpillar is a chocolate sponge cake rolled up with chocolate buttercream and surrounded by a solid chocolate shell. He has a white chocolate face with milk chocolate eyes, little sugar shell chocolates dotted along his body, and white chocolate shoes.\n\nHere\u2019s what Cuthbert looks like sliced up (Picture: Extreme Couponing and Bargains)\n\nSo\u2026 they\u2019re quite similar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept, of course, for the price. While Marks & Spencer\u2019s Colin costs \u00a37, Aldi\u2019s Cuthbert is \u00a34.99, making him quite the bargain.\n\nUnfortunately, you might find Cuthbert tricky to find. He\u2019s not currently available online and is only being trialled in a few stores across the UK \u2013 although if he\u2019s a hit, we reckon he\u2019ll be rolled out nationwide.\n\nOh, and by the way, Marks & Spencer is entirely aware of the copycat caterpillar cake.\n\nAfter someone tweeted them a picture of Cuthbert on Aldi\u2019s shelves, M&S responded with the classic gif of Spiderman confronting an impostor Spiderman. The only appropriate response.\n\nHmm @aldiUK, my spidey senses are tingling\u2026 we definitely spot an impostor\ud83d\udc40 \u2013 Chris pic.twitter.com/fxRO9X8Gdv \u2014 M&S (@marksandspencer) October 2, 2019\n\nIn terms of taste, we haven\u2019t yet been able to get our paws on a Cuthbert, so can\u2019t tell you whether he\u2019s better than his rival, Colin.\n\nWe do know that Colin is married, has kids and is mega successful, so if anyone\u2019s feeling jealous, it\u2019s going to be Cuthbert.\n\nWe think the only option is to spend the weekend tracking both caterpillars down and doing a massive taste test.
