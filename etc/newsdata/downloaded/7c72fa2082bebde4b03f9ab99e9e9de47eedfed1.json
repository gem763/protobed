Many of the most interesting and important developments start with the largest funds, and as new investment ideas like the total portfolio approach and universal ownership gain traction in these organisations, they influence the whole market,\u201d Mr Collie added.\n\nAsia-Pacific continued to feature prominently, with seven pension funds in the top 20.\n\nApart from Singapore, Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment also maintained the global top spot last year, although both South Korea\u2019s National Pension Service (fourth) and China\u2019s National Social Security (seventh) moved down by one place from last year\u2019s ranking.\n\nAsia-Pacific was the second-largest region in terms of AUM with pension funds accounting for 26.2 per cent of all assets in the research, behind North America at 45.2 per cent and ahead of Europe at 24.9 per cent.\n\nIn terms of annualised growth rate, Asia-Pacific grew by 5.2 per cent during 2013-2018, close behind North America which posted the fastest growth at 5.8 per cent. In contrast, Europe\u2019s growth remained almost flat at 0.5 per cent.\n\nJayne Bok, head of investment in Asia at Willis Towers Watson, said: \u201cDespite macroeconomic and global trade headwinds, Asia is still a growing region with a young population, and its long-term growth trajectory remains positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, we should expect a general slowdown in (Asia\u2019s) growth, in line with global markets,\u201d Ms Bok said.\n\nAsia\u2019s pension funds also remained resilient in a turbulent economic environment, while other regions have experienced limited growth.\n\n\u201cTo maintain and improve on this growth, in a region where geopolitical and economic events are becoming more and more unpredictable, it will be essential for Asia-Pacific funds to implement new, creative and innovative investment strategies to keep growth on an upward trajectory and to continue outperforming the market,\u201d Ms Bok noted.\n\nAsia-Pacific funds in the top 20, on a weighted average allocation, are predominantly invested in fixed income (53.8 per cent) and equities (39.2 per cent), while holding less in alternative investments and cash.\n\nOn the other hand, North America funds are more focused on return generation and therefore hold less fixed income and more in equities (46.7 per cent) and alternative investments and cash (33.9 per cent).\n\nThe US continued to dominate the top 300 with a 39.8 per cent share of total AUM, followed by Japan at 11.9 per cent.\n\nAmong the top 300, defined-contribution (DC) assets grew 5.1 per cent last year, while defined-benefit (DB) assets inched down by 0.2 per cent.\n\nDC pension plans allow employees and employers to contribute and invest funds over time to build up a pot of money for retirement, while DB plans are employer-sponsored and provide a specified payment amount in retirement.\n\nThe share of reserve funds \u2013 those set aside by a national government against future liabilities \u2013 shrank by 9.5 per cent, while hybrid fund assets \u2013 those with both DB and DC components \u2013 decreased by 4.6 per cent.\n\nSovereign and public sector pension funds made up 68.5 per cent of the total AUM last year, with 145 such funds in the top 300. Sovereign pension funds represented US$5.1 trillion in assets, while sovereign wealth funds accounted for US$7.9 trillion.\n\nMr Collie also noted that a majority of the largest funds are now highlighting the importance of sustainability.\n\n\u201cESG (environmental, social and governance) factors are now significant financial considerations. Beyond that, there\u2019s also an evolving recognition of the role large investors play within society, and the responsibility that comes with it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe research was conducted by not-for-profit investment research and innovation member group Thinking Ahead Institute, in conjunction with Pensions & Investments, an investment newspaper in the US.\n\nThe Thinking Ahead Institute is an outgrowth of global advisory, broking and solutions firm Willis Towers Watson Investments\u2019 Thinking Ahead Group.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - SINGAPORE\u2019S Central Provident Fund (CPF) bucked the overall global decline in assets under management (AUM), with its total assets growing 6.6 per cent to US$287 billion last year from US$269.1 billion in 2017. .
