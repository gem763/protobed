Then quite suddenly, Britain\u2019s long-running Brexit drama turned into a crisis.\n\nThe new prime minister found himself cornered: shorn of a Commons majority, obliged by furious MPs to beg for a Brexit extension he has sworn never to request, and prevented from calling the snap election he urgently wanted.\n\nParliament, meanwhile, was \u2013 perhaps unlawfully \u2013 suspended until 14 October, preventing MPs from discussing all this until three days before the crunch EU summit at which Brexit\u2019s fate could be decided and a fortnight before the current exit date.\n\nHow did all this play out, what does it mean and where might it go from here? If you\u2019re blindsided or even just bewildered by the latest unlikely plot twists in the interminable saga of Britain\u2019s efforts to leave the EU, this is for you.\n\nHow did it all kick off?\n\nThe first hint the Brexit beast might have been about to wake from its slumber came in late August, after the new government \u2013 made up mostly of hardcore believers, unlike its predecessor \u2013 had spent the early summer hammering home its core message and promising that \u201cwhatever the circumstances\u201d, Britain would leave the EU on the new Brexit deadline of 31 October.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protester dressed as Boris Johnson digs a grave outside Downing Street on 28 August.

Parliament, however, had other ideas, refusing to endorse the deal and forcing the UK to delay its planned departure.\n\nAfter MPs rejected the withdrawal agreement in three successive votes but proved unable, over many months, to decide on any alternative course of action, May gave up. And in came Johnson.\n\nThe problem, said the new prime minister, was that the Brexit deal contained the infamous Irish backstop, the mechanism to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It was \u201cundemocratic\u201d, he said, and had to go.\n\nThe UK would, of course, far prefer to leave with a deal, but it would not hesitate to leave without one \u2013 and no amount of Commons votes, or even an election campaign, would change its mind. It was up to \u201cour friends and partners\u201d in the EU to budge.\n\nBut after spending nearly two painstaking years negotiating the 577 pages of Theresa May\u2019s deal and having always said it could not be reopened, the EU did not believe Johnson wanted a deal. His \u201ccentral scenario\u201d, European diplomats were told, was to crash out.\n\nAnd that is where things stood \u2013 a fraught standoff in an essentially phoney war \u2013 on 28 August, when the prime minister suddenly announced he had asked the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks, from early September to mid-October.\n\nAnd it all, for want of a better term, kicked off.\n\nAn unprecedented 10 days\n\nSuspension, or prorogation, is normal in between governments; it usually lasts a couple of weeks. It is not normal for five weeks, little more than 50 days before arguably the most momentous event in the country\u2019s history since the second world war.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson and his special advisor Dominic Cummings leave from the rear of Downing Street before heading to the Houses of Parliament on 3 September. Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUnless steps were taken beforehand, on 31 October the UK would, with enormous consequences, crash out of the EU without a deal. Opposition and rebel Tory MPs assumed Johnson wanted to stop parliament stop him doing what he wanted. They were outraged.\n\nWith a window of barely a week before prorogation kicked in, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru and the Greens joined forces with 21 doughty Tory objectors, including two former chancellors and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson.\n\nAmid nationwide public protests, Johnson and his cabinet tried to head them off, refusing to rule out simply ignoring any anti no-deal law, and threatening to expel from the Conservative party any rebels who dared vote for one. It didn\u2019t stop them. His opponents declared parliamentary war.\n\nTogether, they voted to seize control of the parliamentary agenda on the first full day after the summer recess and, then in a series of remarkable votes, rammed through a bill forcing Johnson to ask the EU for another extension \u2013 he said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d \u2013 if there was still no agreed Brexit deal by mid-October.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the House of Commons on 4 September Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament\n\nMany of the Conservative rebels said their resolve had been strengthened rather than shaken by the prime minister\u2019s bullying. Their subsequent sackings \u2013 by text message\u2013 enraged moderate Conservatives who lamented what they called the transformation of their previously broad-church party into a narrow, extremist Brexit sect.\n\nWithin a week of parliament\u2019s return, Johnson had suffered an unprecedented six consecutive parliamentary defeats, including two on motions of his own demanding an early election: perhaps not surprisingly, his rebel purge having left him with a majority of minus 41, he failed to get the required two-thirds of MPs\u2019 votes.\n\nRebel and opposition MPs alike by now had so little trust in Johnson that they refused to allow any fresh elections until they were sure an extension had been secured and a no-deal Brexit on 31 October ruled out. Even his own brother, Jo, quit the cabinet, citing a conflict between \u201cfamily loyalty and the national interest\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest MPs protest in the House of Commons as parliament is suspended.

But there was one more twist: sensationally, Scottish judges declared his move was aimed at silencing parliament and was therefore unlawful. The supreme court will rule next week.\n\nSo what happens now?\n\nNot for the first time in the Brexit saga, that is the \u00a3350m-a-week question. Britain is certainly \u2013 again not for the first time \u2013 an international laughing stock. But where we go from here is still not much clearer than it was before that long, quiet summer. Commentators see four main options.\n\nFirst, Johnson could still get a deal, perhaps by agreeing to the EU\u2019s original proposal to resolve the Ireland problem: creating a border in the Irish sea. Winning parliamentary approval would be very hard, but perhaps possible \u2013 Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies want to deliver, and Tory hardliners may see this as their last chance.\n\nSecond, he could break his promise, request an extension and then immediately demand an election, counting on a fiercely anti-EU, people-versus-parliament campaign to see him through. This could, however, leave him vulnerable to a squeeze from both the Brexit party and (possibly) a coordinated opposition promising a second referendum.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Corbyn speaks in the House of Commons on 3 September Photograph: Roger Harris/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThird, he could go full no deal on 31 October as he promised, ignoring the law (or at least testing it to its limits in the courts). He could then call an early election after the UK leaves the EU, trusting that with Brexit delivered, the Brexit party will be no more \u2013 and hoping that no deal is not so catastrophic that the country does not give him a kicking.\n\nFinally, he could be pushed out by a no-confidence vote or step down of his own accord. Rather than the divisive Jeremy Corbyn, a more neutral figure (Ken Clarke?) might then head up a temporary government whose sole purpose would be to ask the EU for an extension. Elections would then follow which, if he campaigned for no deal, Johnson could conceivably win.\n\nWill the EU27 play ball? They are, certainly, rapidly running out of patience. Most now would really like the UK just to go as soon as possible. They will never throw Ireland under the bus by ditching the backstop - but if no deal could still be avoided, they would be pleased.\n\nA good reason (elections, a new government) would be needed, but it is hard to see even Emmanuel Macron refusing a request for an extension intended to avoid no deal.\n\nNo one wants to be seen to be actively helping the UK over the cliff edge.", "description": "The Brexit storm resurged in August, embroiling the Queen, the courts, and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71fe07470e73f16bf6d8685430baa30ce458fd28/892_926_2566_1540/master/2566.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb8353476dcfa5a2e7be25e01dda22e8", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
