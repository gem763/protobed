That month may already be front loaded with some extra stress, thanks to political headlines swirling around President Trump and the White House, along with trade and economic worries.\n\nAs of late, jittery investors have been seeking out value stocks \u2014 those companies believed to be undervalued in the market \u2014 and backing away from high-growth momentum type stocks such as Amazon AMZN, -1.61%.\n\nOur call of the day comes from a fan of value stocks \u2014 Vahan Janjigian, chief investment officer at Greenwich Wealth Management, who thinks they are due for a revival after falling out of favor over the past 10 years.\n\n\u201cMy view is that you always want to be investing in stocks that are selling for less than their worth,\u201d Janjigian told MarketWatch in an interview.\n\nHe offers up three stocks he thinks investors are overlooking right now, starting with IBM IBM, +0.27%. He thinks the company, up 29% so far this year, still has a lot to offer investors. While some worry the multinational technology company overpaid for the acquisition of software group Red Hat, he loves IBM for its cash flow and the fact it pays a \u201cvery nice dividend.\u201d\n\nCash flow represents money moving in and out of a corporation and if it\u2019s rising, that means there\u2019s money to reinvest, pay the bills and return cash to shareholders.\n\nHe also likes oil and gas exploration group Murphy Oil MUR, -0.77%, also for its strong cash flow and a \u201cgenerous dividend.\u201d The group\u2019s fortunes are tied to the price of oil, so it rides those prices up and down. Janjigian doesn\u2019t think Saudi Arabia will get its oil facilities back online as fast as they say they will, following attacks earlier this month. If that pans out, it\u2019s bullish for oil, and Murphy.\n\nFinally, he\u2019s keen on retailer Macy\u2019s M, -1.87%, the S&P\u2019s worst performer this year which produced a dismal set of earnings last quarter. In its favor, the CIO argues Macy\u2019s is still very profitable, and management has pledged to sustain the dividend. They\u2019ve also got enough cash flow to pay debt and even make a strategic investment if needed.\n\nThe market\n\nDow YM00, +0.26%, S&P ES00, +0.33% and Nasdaq NQ00, +0.30% futures are rising, while gold GCZ19, -0.94% heads the other way. Oil CLX19, -0.94% is flat, and the dollar DXY, +0.03% is up, notably against the pound GBPUSD, -0.1866% after comments by a Bank of England official.\n\nEuropean stocks SXXP, +0.58% are rising, while Asian markets ADOW, -0.71% had a mixed day, with losses in China SHCOMP, +0.11%.\n\nThe chart\n\nUnitedHealth shares UNH, -3.01% are looking at a 12% loss for the third quarter, the worst quarterly performance since 2010. Providing our chart of the day is Miller Tabak + Co.\u2019s lead strategist Matt Maley with his view on why shares have had a bumpy ride:\n\n\u201cSome of our customers have started calling UnitedHealth the \u201cElizabeth Warren Indicator\u201d. When she falls in the polls, the stock rallies. However, when she rises in the polls (like she has in a meaningful way recently), the stock goes down,\u201d he explains.\n\nRecent polls put her neck and neck with former Vice President Joe Biden as a possible Democratic candidate for the 2020 presidential race. Warren, unlike Biden, backs Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan that would eliminate the role played by private insurers.\n\nThe buzz\n\nShares of Peloton Interactive PTON, -11.17%, which sells machines connected to live online fitness classes, flopped on its first trading day Thursday, reflecting investor doubts about fast-growing tech names. Meanwhile, entertainment agency Endeavor canceled its own IPO plans.\n\nApple reportedly plans to bring feature-length movies to the theater before releasing them on its own streaming service\n\nShares of Micron Technology MU, -1.76% shares are down after the memory-chip maker posted another big earnings fall and forecast a downbeat holiday season.\n\nThe economy\n\nDurable goods orders, personal income, consumer spending and core inflation are due early, followed by the University of Michigan consumer-sentiment index. We\u2019ll also hear from Fed Vice Chairman for Banking Supervision Randal Quarles and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harder.\n\nThe quote\n\n\u201cYou know, Jane, it was like applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado.\u201d \u2014 That was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commenting on her loss to President Trump in the 2016 election. Her interview with \u201dCBS Sunday Morning,\u201d set to air Sunday.\n\nRead: Trump re-election campaign raises $13 million after impeachment announcement\n\nRandom reads\n\nSaudi Arabia wants to become your next tourist destination\n\nJapan Airlines will tell passengers where the babies are sitting\n\nThat \u201cOK\u201d hand symbol is no longer OK to use\n\nNew York has just sent a $4 million, centuries-old coffin back to Egypt\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
