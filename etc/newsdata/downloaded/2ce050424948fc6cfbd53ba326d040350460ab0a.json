The partnership will focus on solving the unrelenting challenge that open source vulnerabilities create for developers, stemming from code-reuse, public repositories and open source.\n\nTogether, Trend Micro and Snyk will help businesses manage the risk of vulnerabilities without interrupting the software delivery process. The combination of open source vulnerability intelligence from Snyk and Trend Micro will result in the most comprehensive ability to detect vulnerabilities for teams operating in a DevOps environment. Once vulnerabilities in containers are identified, Trend Micro is the shield and Snyk is the fix that combine for streamlined remediation and risk mitigation.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to DevOps, Trend Micro gets it,\u201d said Geva Solomonovich, chief operating officer at Snyk. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Trend Micro to bring their enterprise customers an easy and scalable way to fix open source vulnerabilities. Together, we will continue to help organizations improve their ability to find vulnerabilities earlier in the development process and provide options for how to mitigate and prevent risk in software development.\u201d\n\nOne of the key challenges for enterprise customers today is the need for speed in developing applications. Speed and efficiency is gained by leveraging open source code. Gartner reports,1 \u201cOpen-source software is used within mission-critical IT workloads by over 95% of the IT organizations worldwide, whether they are aware of it or not.\u201d Research from Snyk also found that those vulnerabilities in open source libraries are growing rapidly, nearly doubling in two years.2\n\n\u201cSnyk\u2019s approach and trust they\u2019ve built directly with the development community is unmatched,\u201d said Kevin Simzer, chief operating officer at Trend Micro. \u201cOur collaboration demonstrates both companies\u2019 understanding of the tools developers need and how we can provide security without getting in their way. This strategic partnership is the start of future collaboration as we both work to secure the DevOps workflow.\u201d\n\n[1] Gartner, Inc.; What Innovation Leaders Must Know About Open-Source Software; 26 August 2019 | G00441577\n\n[2] Snyk, Inc.; 2019 State of Open Source Security https://snyk.io/blog/88-increase-in-application-library-vulnerabilities-over-two-years/\n\nAdditional terms of the ongoing partnership and product integration will be announced in November, 2019.
