(Amir Cohen/Reuters)\n\nThe case of a young Israeli American backpacker arrested in a Moscow airport with a third of an ounce of hashish in her luggage and sentenced to more than seven years in prison reads like the plot of a complicated political thriller.\n\nGeopolitical tensions, high-level diplomacy and an extradition order for an international hacker are all tied in up in the story of Na\u2019ama Issachar, a 26 year-old detained on her way home to Israel after traveling and studying yoga in India.\n\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Issachar moved to Israel when she was 16, finishing high school and serving in the army. Like many young people, she decided to go backpacking after finishing her service.\n\nShe flew back via Russia because it was cheaper, said her mother, Yaffa, in an interview from the Russian capital on Sunday. As she attempted to board her connecting flight on April 10, she was stopped by Russian authorities who said they found drugs in her bag.\n\n\u201cWhen Na\u2019ama got to the gate and showed her boarding pass, she was asked to wait. Then a man approached and told her to go with him,\u2019 \u201d said Yaffa. \u201cShe texted me a few minutes later telling me something was going on with her luggage, she said she didn\u2019t think they would let her on the plane but told me not to worry.\u201d\n\nLawyers also told Yaffa not to be concerned, saying \u2014 even after the first few days of Issachar\u2019s detainment \u2014 the 26-year-old would just receive a slap on the wrist: a fine or, at worst, a few months under house arrest. Issachar has no previous convictions.\n\n\n\nNa\u2019ama Issachar was sentence to 7\u00bd years in prison after a small amount of hashish was found in her checked luggage. (Issachar family)\n\nIn a similar case this year, 19-year-old American student Audrey Lorber was arrested in a St. Petersburg airport with two-thirds of an ounce of cannabis in her luggage. A Moscow court also found her guilty. Instead of a jail sentence, she received a fine equivalent to $230 and time served of just three to four weeks.\n\nFor Issachar, though, there was no time served, no fine and no release to house arrest. A few weeks after her initial incarceration, she was slapped with a harsher charge of drug smuggling, something her lawyers said they had never seen before.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t understand why she was being treated like this,\u201d said Yaffa. She said the conditions of her daughter\u2019s detention have been difficult, particularly because of the language barrier. She also said she tried contacting U.S. government officials, congressmen and senators, even sending a pleading letter to President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and special adviser, Jared Kushner.\n\nThen, in August, after deciding to go public with Issachar\u2019s ordeal, the family said they were contacted by a friend of Aleksey Burkov, a Russian IT specialist arrested in Israel in 2015. There is little information on Burkov\u2019s case, but news reports in Israel and Russia say the U.S. issued an Interpol warrant for him on charges relating to cyberattacks and computer network fraud.\n\nIsraeli daily Haaretz wrote Sunday that he was indicted in Virginia in 2015 on four counts of fraud and a year later on additional charges of identity theft, money laundering and illegally accessing a computer.\n\nA story posted on Russian news website RT said Burkov was an IT freelancer from St. Petersburg. It said \u201che was on holiday with his girlfriend in Israel in 2015 when he was hijacked and brought into custody as he was departing Israel, which he says is a standard U.S. scheme.\u201d\n\nThe report also said it was Burkov\u2019s family that had come up with the idea of a prisoner swap \u2014 Burkov\u2019s extradition to Russia in exchange for Issachar.\n\n\u201cI thought he was crazy at first,\u201d said Yaffa. \u201cThe message was very threatening, telling me my daughter would only be released if Burkov was released by Israel. I couldn\u2019t see how it was related.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, as the Moscow court passed down a sentence of 7\u00bd years on Issachar, Israeli media reported that the Russians had linked Issachar\u2019s fate to that of Burkov, requesting the hacker be returned to Russia in exchange for Issachar\u2019s release.\n\nBurkov\u2019s extradition to the United States, however, has already been approved by Israel\u2019s Supreme Court. It is waiting a final green light from Israeli Justice Minister Amir Ohana. On Sunday, the minister told Israeli television that a final decision on Burkov\u2019s extradition would be made in the coming days or weeks.\n\nHe said he hoped U.S. authorities would intervene on Issachar\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cI suppose the Americans have a vested interest that Na\u2019ama not sit in Russian prison, and I hope and believe there will be interference on their part, too,\u201d Ohana told Israel\u2019s Channel 12 News.\n\n[Israelis see Trump\u2019s Syria pullout as a betrayal that could help unravel the region]\n\nDays after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria that has left some Israelis wondering about American loyalties in the region, Issachar\u2019s case appears caught up in high-level diplomacy.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized Issachar\u2019s punishment as \u201cdisproportionate.\u201d He said it did \u201cnot fit the nature of the offense being attributed to her.\u201d\n\nHe is under pressure at home to bring Issachar back, especially after touting his close ties with the Russian and American presidents during the recent national election.\n\nHe said he had raised the case twice with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month when the two leaders met in Sochi, Russia, and last week in a telephone conversation, asking for her sentence to be commuted and the terms of her detention eased.\n\n\u201cIsrael will continue to make every effort with the Russian authorities in order to bring about Naama Issachar\u2019s release and return her to her family,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope the effort will bear fruit.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu made no mention of whether the Israelis were also working with U.S. authorities on the matter. A request for a response from the State Department by The Washington Post was unanswered Sunday.\n\nYaffa said her daughter\u2019s lawyers were planning to appeal the sentence in a hearing Monday. She told The Post that she had spoken to Netanyahu and was hopeful that diplomatic efforts would free her daughter.\n\n\u201cI just want to take her home,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nRussia revives allegations of Israeli culpability in downed plane in Syria\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "An airport drugs arrest has become a bargaining chip to spring a Russian hacker jailed in Israel and set to be extradited to the U.S.", "authors": ["Ruth Eglash", "Reporter Covering Israel", "The Palestinian Territories", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9Uq5BBE9Wxn0Q3JqeCl8sICJD7g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U3KF7HXNW4I6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
