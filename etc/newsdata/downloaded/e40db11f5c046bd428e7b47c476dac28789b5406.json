(Ilana Panich-Linsman/The New York Times) More\n\n\u201cHe had no choice,\u201d Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor and longtime friend of the president\u2019s said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been done in the first place. And it\u2019s a good move to get out of it and get that out of the papers and off the news.\u201d\n\nThe president first heard the criticism of his choice of the Doral watching TV, where even some Fox News personalities were disapproving. By Saturday afternoon, his concerns had deepened when he put in a call to Camp David, where Mulvaney was hosting moderate congressional Republicans for a discussion of issues facing them, including impeachment, and was told the consensus was he should reverse himself. Those moderates are among the votes Trump would need to stick with him during an impeachment.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see it being a big negative, but it certainly wasn\u2019t a positive,\u201d said Rep. Peter T. King of New York, one of those at Camp David. He said the group told Trump\u2019s aides that sticking with the decision \u201cwould be a distraction.\u201d\n\nWith many members already unhappy with the consequences of the president\u2019s move to withdraw troops from Syria, and Democrats pressing their impeachment inquiry, Republicans on Capitol Hill were not eager to have to defend the appropriateness of the president\u2019s decision to host the Group of 7 meeting at one of his own properties.\n\n\u201cI think there was a lot of concern,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a member of the Republicans\u2019 leadership team. \u201cI\u2019m not sure people questioned the legality of it, but it clearly was an unforced political error.\u201d\n\nCole said he did not speak to the president directly about it, but expressed relief that Trump had changed his mind, and was certain that other Republicans felt the same way. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t need this,\u201d he said.\n\nBy late Saturday afternoon, Trump had made his decision, but he waited to announce his reversal until that night in two tweets that were separated by a break the president took to watch the opening of Jeanine Pirro\u2019s Fox News program.\n\n\u201cI thought I was doing something very good for our country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 leaders,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, before again promoting the resort\u2019s amenities. \u201cBut, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201cTherefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020.\u201d\n\nTrump suggested as a possibility Camp David, the rustic, official presidential retreat that Mulvaney had denigrated as an option when he announced the choice of Doral. But Mulvaney said the president was candid in his disappointment.", "description": "He knew he was inviting criticism by choosing his own luxury golf club in Miami for the site of a gathering of world leaders at the Group of 7 summit in June, President Donald Trump told his aides opposed to the choice, and he was prepared for the inevitable attack from Democrats.But what Trump was not", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Eric Lipton", "Katie Rogers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OOW5_qMp.HALOe41ZxIOrg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/2aeea5f18958fc7cb723207d4a4ea523", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
