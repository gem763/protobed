He turned away to punch his fist into the night sky. His first goal of the season has come late this season.\n\nChaos followed late on when Barcelona substitute Ronald Araujo was sent off on his debut for what looked an innocuous challenge on Javier Hernandez as they were running through towards the Barcelona goal shoulder to shoulder.\n\nOusmane Dembele followed him down the tunnel picking up a straight red. Referee Mateu Lahoz had interpreted that Dembele had deliberate knocked the spray out of his hand. It looked accidental but if it is interpreted as deliberate he could now miss the Clasico.\n\n\u2018How bad you are,\u2019 sung the Barcelona supporters at the match official who has a well-earned reputation in Spain for always wanting to be the main event, even in the company of great players.\n\nLuis Suarez scored a sensational overhead kick to give Barcelona the lead on Sunday night\n\nThe forward runs off to celebrate his 27th minute goal against Sevilla in La Liga\n\nMidfielder Arturo Vidal pokes home after getting on the end of a ball into the box\n\nBefore the late flurry of cards came the goals. Luis Suarez shoulder-barged the floodgates open on 27 minutes by acrobatically dispatching Nelson Semedo\u2019s cross from the left after the full-back, Frenkie De Jong and Ousmane Dembele had ganged-up on Jesus Navas. The cross was good \u2014 the scissor-kick finish even better.\n\nNavas was suffering again on 32 minutes when Barcelona cracked Sevilla\u2019s tentative offside trap. Semedo, Arthur Melo and Suarez played a clever triangle of passes. And from the Uruguayan\u2019s lay-off Arthur\u2019s cross-shot was turned in by Arturo Vidal. First to rush out towards the match official with his hand up was Navas but it had been the right-back who had been playing the goal-scorer onside.\n\nGoal three came just three minutes later when Fernando was robbed in midfield and the ball ran to Dembele he dropped his shoulder to send Diego Carlos skidding out of frame and sent a right foot shot past Vaclik. You don\u2019t always get the poetry and the motion from the inconsistent former Dortmund winger but when you do it is something to behold.\n\nSevilla had played well for the first hour and Luuk de Jong might have scored a hat-trick and yet somehow they had gone three behind in the space of eight minutes. The striker position is proving problematic for them.\n\nThe Barcelona players surround Vidal after he doubled their advantage against Sevilla\n\nOusmane Dembele then struck in the 35th minute of the game to triple their lead\n\nThe winger raises a fist in celebration as his side ran rampant in Sunday night's game\n\nDe Jong had been denied by Marc-Andre ter Stegen and had headed two chances wide of the target \u2013 the first tamely wide and the second into the ground and over the bar.\n\nThe difference in finishing between Suarez and De Jong had been the catalyst for such an emphatic half-time score. Julen Lopetegui lost 5-1 the last time he was here and then lost his job as Real Madrid manager.\n\nThis was turning into another nightmare. He had also been booked in the first half. He made two changes at the break bringing on Munir El Haddadi and Joan Jordan for Oliver Torres and Nolito.\n\nThere was some resistance with Sergio Reguilon\u2019s long run forward deserving better from Lucas Ocampos. The Argentinian forward failed to test Ter Stegen with his shot instead of playing it back to the Real Madrid loanee full-back.\n\nThere was no mercy from Messi and when he cut through Sevilla\u2019s defence moments later on Vaclik\u2019s saved stopped it from ending in in the fourth goal.\n\nLionel Messi impressed as he continues his comeback from an injury hit start to the season\n\nThe Argentine forward lines up a free-kick in front of the spectators at the Nou Camp\n\nErnesto Valverde watches on as his side storm to victory on Sunday night at the Nou Camp\n\nDembele was next to go close. Close maybe not the most appropriate word. He was certainly close to goal but from just in front of the penalty spot he put the ball a long way over the bar.\n\nBarcelona coach Ernesto Valverde brought both Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic on, and with Antoine Griezmann watching from the bench he then turned to Araujo to replace the tiring Jean-Clair Todibo.\n\nGriezmann\u2019s time will surely come this season but as he was warned over a year ago when he first considered the the move to the Camp Nou \u2013 if you go to Barca you\u2019ll just be another one of the players.\n\nWith ten minutes left Messi scored his free-kick and it was four. Then came the cards and the chaos.\n\nIt was another big defeat for Lopetegui in the Camp Nou. He will not be sacked for this one. He, like the rest of La Liga, will be just left to fear the worst that Barcelona and Messi are getting back to their best.\n\nMessi admires his free-kick as it flies over the Sevilla wall and into the back of the net", "description": "PETE JENSON: Barcelona eased to a 4-0 win against Sevilla on Sunday night with Lionel Messi scoring his first goal of the season.
