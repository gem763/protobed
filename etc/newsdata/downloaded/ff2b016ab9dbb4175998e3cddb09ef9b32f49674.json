Popcorn is prepped and seats are checked in leading up to the first showing of the day.\n\nKaren Chappell is familiar with the usual suspects found there at this time, including director of operations Emily Salmonson, programming director Rebecca Fons, and head projectionist and facilities manager Ross Meyer. As the once and current board director, Chappell remembers a time before most of them worked there, when the theater was a fledgling start up with an uncertain future.\n\n\u201cThe first thing we had to do was find a place, get money to furnish it and get all the equipment,\u201d Chappell told the Iowa City Press-Citizen . \u201cWe started out doing a crowd funding campaign and we were hoping to get $75,000. we actually ended up raising $91,000.\u201d\n\nThis came after years of FilmScene founders Andrew Sherburne and Andy Brodie trying to get Iowa City on board with a nonprofit indie theater in downtown. From the beginning, community buy-in and financial support has been critical.\n\nFilmScene\u2019s small pedestrian mall location - while popular - was always meant to be a temporary home.\n\nBut \u201cthe Chauncey was always the plan\u201d, according to Meyer, referring to the theater\u2019s fancy and expansive new digs in Iowa City\u2019s newest high-rise.\n\nTenants are already moving into Chauncey\u2019s apartments, and on the weekend of Sept. 20, FilmScene will likewise take its long awaited place there as \u201cthe greatest small city for the arts\u201d gets a little bit bigger.\n\nBefore that can happen, though, some final construction details must be wrapped up.\n\nWith the closing of the Campus III theater in 2007, downtown Iowa City was left without a dedicated movie theater for years. Now it\u2019s about to inherit one of the most modern in the Midwest between Chicago and Omaha.\n\n\u201cWe see this not just as a celebration of how far FilmScene has come in the six years since we\u2019ve opened our doors here,\u201d said Sherburne, one of the founders, \u201cbut just celebrating what we see as a bright future in Iowa City in that effort to build the greatest small city for the arts.\u201d\n\nSpeakers, screens, acoustic panels and the like are still being prepared, and this week projection and sound equipment are being installed with construction on track to finish just in time for opening weekend.\n\n\u201cThe theaters are themselves works of art and the equipment in the projection booths are just the best,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nThe \u201cpods\u201d holding the two main screens in the space, hidden behind wood paneling, aren\u2019t conventional theater fair. Patrons don\u2019t wander a darkened hall to find a screen, rather this space is open and bright and walk-able.\n\nThe largest of the two main theaters will have 121 seats with the other boasting over 60. Kiosks will also be found in the outer space as an option for ticket buying, which will be a reserved seating system.\n\n\u201cYou can actually pick out your seats like if you were going to a concert at the Englert,\u201d said Salmonson, the director of operations. \u201cThat way you don\u2019t have to wait and you know your seat\u2019s going to be there when you get there.\u201d\n\nHelping to ensure the quality of the theater experience is Boston Light & Sound, the team behind bringing Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cHateful Eight\u201d to 70 mm film. The company, which handles specs for film festivals around the country, are setting up FilmScene\u2019s state-of-the-art soundscape.\n\n\u201cThey do a lot of testing and dialing in of the equipment to really make it customized for this space,\u201d Sherburne said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working with some of the best in the business to make this all happen.\u201d\n\nAnyone who\u2019s been inside FilmScene\u2019s ped mall location should be used to couches mixed in with more conventional theater seats. At the Chauncey, the tradition of diverse seating will continue.\n\n\u201cOn the top balcony level we\u2019ll have softer seating, kind of swivel chairs and it\u2019ll feel more like a lounge up there,\u201d said Salmonson. \u201cIt just adds to the unique experience that we\u2019re trying to get over there, it\u2019s just a fun way to play around with how we can get the space to feel more interesting and how we can separate ourselves from mainstream movie theaters.\u201d\n\nWith the space and programming essentially set in stone, there is still some uncertainty regarding how often the theater\u2019s film projectors will be put to use.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll (show movies on film) as often as the market demands, as often as people get excited about it,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll do it a lot.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, he\u2019s still feeling out what might work in film, but there\u2019s one old film reel he\u2019s got his trigger finger on.\n\n\u201cI have a sort of gloriously beat up 16 mm print of Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u2018Dirty Harry\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that might be our first 16 mm screening, hopefully in November.\u201d\n\nThe reason Meyer is optimistic and not certain is \u201cjust because you own a copy of the film doesn\u2019t mean you can play the film.\u201d Calls need to be made and rights need to be acquired before a theater can show a film.\n\nThat, of course, is where Rebecca Fons comes in.\n\nThe most spectacular sound system and the most fabulous film projector mean nothing without the right selection of films.\n\n\u201cWe knew (we\u2019d show) \u2018Field of Dreams,\u201d Fons said. \u201cYou can\u2019t open a theater without showing one of the most iconic movies in Iowa, and we did want to do a classic wink or a nod to movies with classic movie moments.\u201d\n\nIt can sometimes be tricky to snag the rights to show classic movies. FilmScene\u2019s opening line-up, which includes sci-fi classic \u201cThe Blob\u201d is a perfect example of what Fons sometimes has to do to make a movie happen.\n\nThe rights for the 1958 film reside with Judith Harris, the widow of the late film producer Jack Harris. Fons had to reach out to the folks behind Blobfest in Phoenixville, Penn. to try and track down Harris.\n\n\u201cI explained to her what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Fons said. \u201cShe only really secures screening rights for things that are special. She holds it very dear.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fons, Judith responded, \u201cI really love what you\u2019re doing and I want to present this film as a celebration of your expansion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then I made a little bit of a joke about how the blob keeps growing and taking over,\u201d Fons said, \u201cand, like that, (FilmScene) is growing and taking a new shape.\u201d\n\nThe new space is effectively doubling the number of screens FilmScene will have. This means more work for Fons, but she is excited to find more variety of films to share with Iowa City movie fanatics.\n\nMovies like \u201cA Star is Born\u201d and \u201cFirst Man\u201d were motion pictures FilmScene couldn\u2019t fit in last year because of limited screens. Now, they have space to spare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited with all the movies coming out this fall and into the winter because I can identify the ones that in the past we wouldn\u2019t have been able to show,\u201d Fons said. \u201cI feel like a kid in a candy store.\u201d\n\nOnce Fons has scheduled a movie or series, it\u2019s up to Salmonson to make it pop. A job that, at times, involves \u201cfiguring out a funny, quirky, movie-themed drink\u201d which will be easier now with the liquor license the organization has at the Chauncey location.\n\n\u201cIt will be good to broaden our drink horizons,\u201d Salmonson said. \u201cAnd with the bowling alley in the new building we\u2019ve been like, \u2018We need to do White Russians for the \u2018Big Lebowski.\u201d People need to drink Caucasians if we show that movie.\u201d\n\nAlso diversifying the selection for the venue is the Bijou Film Board, a student-run film organization which will have offices in the new building. For four decades, Bijou has brought unique and interesting films to fellow students as well as other film buffs, previously located at the Iowa Memorial Union.\n\n\u201cWith the new space it\u2019s really opening up the kinds of movies we can show,\u201d said Molly Bagnall, the new Bijou Film Board director. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to grow the amount of films we can show and we\u2019re also facing something we\u2019ve never dealt with before: What does it mean to have a movie theater with that extreme visibility?\u201d\n\nLike Fons, Bagnall has to balance mass popularity and artistic quality in choosing programming. But Bagnall has confidence in her Bijou team and is particularly excited about the film projectors, which will increase the range of movies they can show.\n\nThe first of these will be a Taiwanese sex musical called \u201cThe Wayward Cloud\u201d at 10 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 21, and Bagnall hopes to find a way to feature one of her favorite films \u201cCeline and Julie Go Boating.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the crest of something that\u2019s really developing (in Iowa City) as far as film is concerned and FilmScene is part of that,\u201d said Chappell, referring to not only the film-making efforts of people like Sherburne, but other area movie makers and the UI. \u201cI just think this is a very dynamic community for the arts.\u201d\n\nThe original space, the intended home-between-homes on the Pedestrian Mall, will remain where it is, fully operational and called FilmScene on the Ped Mall.\n\n\u201cPeople have really grown to love this space, so there\u2019s an attachment here and there\u2019s an attachment for us,\u201d said Joe Tiefenthaler, the theater\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe believe that this is an elemental part of the downtown district, that we should keep that culture of foot traffic running through the ped mall.\u201d\n\nRenovations are scheduled for this smaller space, including a general tune up and new seats. There is also consideration of carrying over the reserved seating system being introduced with FilmScene at the Chauncey, but the original will remain general admission for the time being.\n\n\u201cThis space was supposed to be a stop-gap before the Chauncey, but we\u2019ve fallen in love with it over the last five-plus years,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cWe want it to be as relevant in another five years, 10 years, 20 years, whatever, as it is now; that\u2019s part of the plan.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Iowa City Press-Citizen, http://www.press-citizen.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Most weekday afternoons the lobby at FilmScene is one part office, one part communal hang place for the staff.
