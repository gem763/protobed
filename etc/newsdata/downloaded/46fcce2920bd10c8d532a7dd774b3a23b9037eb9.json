It destroyed or damaged 63 properties.\n\nPictured: The annihilated furniture store in New Ferry after Blasio turned on the gas and an electric fire in the store\n\nJudge Teague told him: 'You did not care who else might suffer as long as you could swindle the insurers out of \u00a350,000, money to which you knew perfectly well you had no right.'\n\nHe said the blast was 'colossal' and 'annihilated' the furniture store and dance studio above it, as well as effectively reducing an entire block of buildings 'to rubble'.\n\nThe judge said it was a 'remarkable stroke of sheer good fortune' that no-one was killed.\n\nBlasio, whose wife was in tears in court, sat with his head against the glass panel of the dock at times during the hearing and shook his head as the judge read his sentencing remarks.\n\nThis still taken from CCTV footage shows the street in New Ferry just before Blasio's explosion wrecked surrounding properties\n\nThe explosion is pictured as it annihilated the furniture store, before spreading to other properties and injuring residents\n\nThe explosion left the street strewn with debris as the furniture store collapsed after the explosion on the Wirral\n\nThe court heard that among the 81 victims of the explosion was Lewis Jones, who was waiting at a bus stop when the blast happened and suffered a serious brain injury. Henry Riding, prosecuting, said: 'He was left, literally, clinging to life.'\n\nMr Jones, who was 21 at the time, was in court for the hearing along with other members of the community.\n\nIan Brown, who had been having a meal in Lan's Chinese restaurant, opposite the furniture shop, when the explosion happened, told the court it felt like a terrorist attack.\n\nHe said: 'It was a complete scene of devastation and there was complete pandemonium. The air was thick with dust, you couldn't see.'\n\nThe roofs of surrounding houses were wrecked by the blast after Blasio set off the gas and turned on his electric fire\n\nThe court heard a number of statements from residents describing the impact of the injuries and damage to properties.\n\nKim Ashwin, co-owner of Complete Works Performance School above the Homes In Style shop, said if the blast had happened earlier in the day or on any other night of the week there could have been 100 children and their families inside the dance studio.\n\nBlasio (pictured) has been jailed for 20 years following the horrendous blast\n\nIn a statement, Neil Mitchell, from Wirral Council environmental services, said: 'The explosion in March 2017 was probably the most significant disaster that the council and emergency services in the borough had ever faced in peacetime.'\n\nDavid Mason QC, defending, said Blasio, a grandfather-of-seven, had suffered intimidation from inmates in prison while on remand.\n\nHe said: 'Mr Blasio has lost everything now, his family will suffer.'\n\nBlasio was sentenced to 20 years for causing the explosion and given a concurrent sentence of eight years for the fraud.\n\nBlasio originally stood trial in January but the jury was discharged after being unable to reach a verdict and a retrial began last month.\n\nBefore his trial, Contract Natural Gas pleaded guilty to an offence under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 by failing to ensure that gas supply pipes were disconnected.\n\nThe company was fined \u00a3320,000 and ordered to pay \u00a350,000 towards the prosecution costs.", "description": "Pascal Blasio (pictured) released gas into Homes In Style on the Wirral before turning on an electric fire, annihilating his failing business and destroying or damaging 63 properties.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20084590-0-image-a-88_1571837212985.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
