After the summer rollercoaster of Ashes cricket there will surely be no fiercer clash in the Rugby World Cup than the contest in Japan tomorrow morning. RICHARD KAY brings you the novice's guide to the battle of the giants.\n\nEngland out for revenge\n\nThe two nations have met in six of the eight previous tournaments, winning three matches each. Both have lifted the Webb Ellis trophy at the other's expense and both have enjoyed victories on their rival's home turf.\n\nFour years ago, host nation England crashed out of the World Cup when Australia inflicted a humiliating defeat on them at Twickenham.\n\nSince then, England have recorded six straight victories against the Wallabies. But in tomorrow's quarter-final clash, reputations will count for nothing.\n\nBattle of the big mouths\n\nThe two coaches, Eddie Jones of England and Michael Cheika of Australia, are both Australian-born, but only one will have bragging rights tomorrow.\n\nThey played for the same team, Randwick in Sydney, and bonded over a shared status as ethnic interlopers in an establishment sport. Jones has a Japanese-American mother and Cheika a Lebanese father. But their rivalry has put that friendship on hold.\n\nA steamy stage\n\nBuilt in Oita, 600 miles from Tokyo, for the football World Cup in 2002, Oita Stadium has a 40,000 capacity.\n\nOita is famous for its hot springs \u2014 the Japanese go there to soak in the waters. Strict spa admission rules forbidding customers with tattoos have been temporarily relaxed. In Japanese culture the tattoo is associated with organised crime.\n\nDuffer's guide to game\n\nThe players: Fifteen per side, including eight chunky forwards (the 'pack', including 'props' and 'flankers') and seven 'backs' \u2014 the speedy runners. One of the pack is called a 'hooker', a reference to his skill at hooking the ball out of the scrum, and nothing else, thank you.\n\nTry: The term for when a player touches the oval ball (a hangover from the days when it was a pig's bladder) over the line at the opposite end of the pitch \u2014 increasingly followed, these days, by flamboyant celebrations more typical of a football match. Earns five points, plus two for a 'conversion' \u2014 when the ball is kicked over the bar between the posts.\n\nScrum: When the two packs combine into mud-caked, multi-headed monsters \u2014 and smash into each other with a loud grunt. Into this melee is flung the ball, which the hookers try to kick back to their teammates. All too often \u2014 as in life \u2014 everything collapses.\n\nTackle: When a player flings himself at the legs of the man running with the ball, to bring him to the ground. If someone throws you the ball and you're immediately tackled, that's a 'hospital pass'. For obvious reasons.\n\nRuck: When a player is tackled and forwards from both sides charge furiously on top of him trying to get the ball. Closely resembles chucking-out time at an inner-city boozer.\n\nMaul: Indistinguishable to many from a ruck \u2014 but the difference is that in a maul, one unfortunate player is holding onto the ball for dear life while somehow still standing up.\n\nOffside: Far too complicated to explain here . . . or anywhere.\n\nHow the muscle men line up...\n\nDish of the day\n\nHenry Slade, 26\n\nVital statistics: 6ft 3in and 15 st. Position: centre.\n\nPlays exactly the way he looks (right) \u2014 silky. Great reader of the game. The pin-up of the squad: 'This guy is seriously handsome with a good tan, a great rig [physique] and perfect hair,' says one teammate admiringly.\n\nPsst: He not only drives a Porsche but is the only England player to be sponsored by the German car-maker, too.\n\nHenry Slade, 26. Plays exactly the way he looks (right) \u2014 silky\n\nSuper Maro\n\nMaro Itoje (left in main picture above), 24\n\nVital statistics: 6ft 5in, 18.7 st.\n\nPosition: Lock.\n\nRampaging with ball in hand, he's a destructive tackler. Born in Camden, London, to Nigerian parents. Educated at Harrow thanks to a sports scholarship and has a politics degree from London's School of Oriental & African Studies. His nickname is Pearl \u2014 because he is so precious to every team he plays for. As a child, boxing not rugby was his passion and Muhammad Ali his idol. Has appeared on the cover of Tatler, along with royal pin-up Lady Amelia Windsor.\n\nPsst: Likes writing poetry.\n\nMaro Itoje, 24. Rampaging with ball in hand, he's a destructive tackler\n\nCaptain Fantastic\n\nOwen Farrell (below right), 28\n\nVital statistics: 6ft 1in, 14 st.\n\nPosition: Fly-half.\n\nRugby royalty. His father Andy, former rugby league and union player for England, will take over as coach of Ireland after the World Cup. Many England teammates were at his wedding last year.\n\nPsst: Grew up in the same street as fellow England player George Ford. Ford used to do his French homework for him.\n\nOwen Farrell, 28.

Position: Centre.\n\nInjuries and indiscipline have blighted his career. Was a member of England's 2011 World Cup squad only to enrage authorities by jumping off a ferry into Auckland Harbour. He says a witch doctor in Samoa, where he was born, helped calm him down.\n\nPsst: Coffee-loving Manu is the latte art champion of the team.\n\nAustralia's gay rights giant\n\nDavid Pocock (right in main picture), 31\n\nVital Statistics: 6ft 2in, 18 st. Position: Flanker.\n\nThe human wrecking ball of the Aussie team has more to him than meets the eye. Away from the pitch he is a climate change campaigner and advocate for gay marriage. Refused to marry long-term partner Emma Palandri until same-sex marriage was legalised.\n\nDavid Pocock, 31. The human wrecking ball of the Aussie team has more to him than meets the eye.
