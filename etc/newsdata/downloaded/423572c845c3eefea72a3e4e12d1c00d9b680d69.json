It is naive to have thought that 300 years of very bad practices and policies and annihilation of the people of SA, could be solved immediately, or within a few decades. What is true is that the new government did extremely well to go over from the previous regime, to the current regime, relatively bloodless. Thank your lucky stars that it went this well, as SA was a melting pot, where terrible things could have happened.\n\nI guess the decision you regret for 20 years is that you did not emigrate. Why did you not emigrate ?\n\n-------------------\n\n>>> I read the daily articles on the Fin 24 site and the political situation of incompetence and greed of the \"government\" of this country and forget about going from bad to worse and we have already achieved this, but the continual thieving with impunity and nothing every being done to rectify the situation.\n\nYes, unfortunately the media can have a tremendous bad impact on ones life. Also, unfortunately, the media is not there to report good news. Good news does not sell, only bad news sells. And it is not the media's fault. It is our fault. Humans are such negative beings, that they look for the negative news. They want to be fed negative news daily, year in and year out. For what reason, I do not know, I assume it helps us human beings feel better if worse things happen to other people, than happen to us.\n\nTell me, do you read these articles because you look for reasons as to why it is going bad in SA ? My guess is yes, you made you mind up we are a mess, and now you look for proof, to back up what you decided. Nothing out of the ordinary, most humans do this. Guess what, if you look for reasons to back up your decision, you are going to find them.\n\nAlso my dear Cheryl-Anne, you judge SA, from your world, from your experiences. You think you have it bad. Girl, you know nothing. Go live in a squatter camp for a year. Leave all your money, car, clothes, makeup :-), cell, everything. Go live there, with no job, no income. Do it for a year, then you come tell me again, you have it tough, as this is the reality that about 30/40 million people face in this country. And guess what, those 30/40 million that have so much less than you, still love SA, and want to live here. Millions of immigrants come over our borders illegally. Why do they come if it is so bad here ? Is it possible that it is going worse in their country, than here ?\n\n-------------------\n\n>>> I am NOT proud to be a South African and in fact I am embarrassed to say I come from this country.\n\nA bit dramatic I would say. Even with all the drama going on, I still rate SA as one of the best 10 countries in the world to live in. You just say this, because you have not lived in 120+ other countries, where it goes much worse, than here. Once you lived there, you will cry yourself to sleep every night that you cant live here in SA.\n\nWe are one of the best countries in the world to live in. If you have a job, you actually can have a great life here in SA. I am sure you have a job, what do you complain about. I am sure there are 20 million people that would dearly like to have your problems :-)\n\n-------------------\n\n>>> There is ZERO leadership or competence in this government and the entire reputation of this country rests upon 1 man being Mr. Gordan.\n\nTotally untrue, there is very good leadership in our country, and in government. Unfortunately they work towards the wrong things, like making money for themselves first, instead of looking after the interests of SA. But, that is what you get if you tolerate and allow criminal behavior : you invite more of it. And the more you allow it, it will grow and grow.\n\nBut, the problem is more the people who votes our government into power, that are willing to accept promises, a food parcel and t-shirt for their vote. So, we must not complain if those we vote into power, do not govern in our interests. We have the power, to change this, and vote them out of power. We have this right, every 5 years.\n\nAlso, every country in the world, has problems in government, it is not unique at all to SA. Even the best first world countries in the world, have tremendous problems in their governments. If you think our government is bad, I suggest you go look at many others that are hundreds times worse. But I know, it still does not excuse our governments mistakes.\n\n-------------------\n\n>>> I am busy studying for an international qualification so I can get out of this revolting country and would recommend that all sane people do the same as there is NO FUTURE for any of us bar for Clown Zuma and his buddies.\n\nYes, it is best you go, and go soon. As to there being no future, you may be right, you may be wrong. What I can tell you, I have seen quite a few hundred cases of people that emigrated since 1994, and are back in SA. Every time I ask them, tell me, why are you back, it is the same over and over basically. It is not the utopia in the other countries, that they believed it was going to be. Once they get faced by a Europe, Australia, USA where the living cost can be dramatically higher than here, things are not so sweet anymore. Also, there they fire you on the spot if they don't need you. You have no job protection there. I talked to quite a few who were shocked when they pitched up for work, were marched out the building and told they are not needed anymore. Quite a few had to come back after they lost their jobs. Suddenly they were very happy that they had the SA backdoor open. Then SA suddenly was not that bad anymore.\n\nThere are many reasons. One very big one is the weather. We are spoilt here with the best weather in the world. I talk to some friends who emigrated in 1996, who still struggle with the severe weather conditions in America to this day. About all that came back from the UK, curses the grey wet cloudy weather.\n\nAnother reason is living space. In Europe there are so many people, you can't breath. Having a big house and garden there is considered only for Euro or Pound millionaires. Wait till you are cramped up in a little flat of 40 sqm, for years, and tell me again if it takes a toll on you.\n\nI am not saying you can not be happy anywhere, sure you can, you just have to adapt, and make peace with your new country. You can be happy anywhere, or unhappy anywhere, it is just a mindset. You tell yourself if you are happy or not, it is your decision.\n\nI don't blame anyone that wants to emigrate from SA, not at all. If you feel you can make a better life somewhere else, why not. I just say, it is not so bad here, as it seems. You simply just do not know about the problems in the country you are going to emigrate to.\n\nBut, as I always say. Go sit down and make a list. What is it about SA that makes you unhappy, and what is it that make you happy. Dot down what privileges you do have currently, that most do not have. Do you actually see them, or do you take them for granted. Do you appreciate them, or do you not see what you have, and just complain about what you do not have.\n\nBeing happy is a mindset. You look to me like a negative person. Always on the lookout for what is wrong, instead of focusing what is working right in your life. Guess what, with that outlook you are going to be unhappy in any other country as well. I bet you are going to miss SA, and cry because of your longing for SA.\n\nYes, absolutely this country can go down and crash, like Zimbabwe, no doubt about it. Zimbabwe is still ok, go live in DRC or Somalia for a year or two, and tell me again how bad it is here. It can be the other way around as well, meaning, a strong and well run government comes into power, and works with discipline and setting things right. If that happens, I hope you are not coming back :-)\n\nYou say there is no future for us, there is a future for us. Running a country is like running a business, do it wrong, and your business will suffer and go under. Do it well, and it will prosper. Yes, much has been done wrong since 1994, but believe it or not, the government did a tremendous lot right as well. But no-one wants to tell their success stories, as they don't matter, people only want to hear the negative stories. We had one of the greatest presidents the world has ever seen, in Nelson Mandela. I want to believe that we can have a president like that again. It can take just one great man, to make a country great. Go read up how Singapore worked themselves out of misery in 1959, to about the best run country in the world, today. It is possible.\n\nCheryl-Anne, I wish you well for the future, I hope you get what you are dreaming about. But do try to be more positive :-)", "description": "I guess the decision you regret for 20 years is that you did not emigrate.
