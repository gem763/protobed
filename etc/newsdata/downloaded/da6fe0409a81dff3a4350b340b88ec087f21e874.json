The 30-year-old porn star, who recently was named Penthouse magazine\u2019s \u201cPet of the Month,\u201d says that in many ways, her past life and current profession have a lot in common.\n\n\u201cI felt the most fulfilled when I was physically helping people,\u201d she says in a statement about her past God-fearing life as it relates to her current one.\n\n'BOY MEETS WORLD' STAR MAITLAND WARD DOING PORN: 'I FELT READY'\n\nThe sex kitten grew up in a small town in the Pacific Northwest with \u201clittle freedom.\u201d Her parents required her to be religious, but allowed her to pick her own church. When she turned 17, she went with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\u201cThe church took me in, was so welcoming, and wanted to do well by me,\u201d says the 5-foot, 8-inch blond beauty.\n\nShe only had sex once before accepting Mormonism, and obediently adhered to the church\u2019s rule against premarital sex.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not just that premarital sex is denied but that they make it out to be a very serious sin and shameful thing to do,\u201d says Andrews. \u201cThe deeper I got into the religion, the farther from my own identity I got.\u201d\n\nFor 18 months, she proselytized in a stateside mission, and she didn\u2019t have sex again until she was 26.\n\nBELLA THORNE GETS PORN AWARD\n\n\u201cI was very sexually repressed!\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re essentially a nun, devoted to your religion for that period of time.\u201d\n\nShe couldn\u2019t be sexual, watch movies with her family on the Sabbath or even be her sister\u2019s bridesmaid \u2014 because the bridesmaid dress was \u201cimmodest\u201d by Mormon standards. Her inability to be in her sibling\u2019s wedding party made Andrews reconsider her Mormon faith. She was also starting to miss her old passions: singing, dancing and acting.\n\nIn 2017, she stopped attending church. The following year, she moved to California to become an actress, but despite having a bachelor\u2019s degree from Brigham Young University, she couldn\u2019t even find work as a waitress.\n\nSo she tried her luck as an exotic dancer.\n\n\u201cI started getting contacted by a lot of porn agents,\u201d says the curvy adult film starlet, who today has more than 70,000 Instagram followers.\n\nThis January, the performer, now based in Florida, linked with an agent and has quickly risen in the porn ranks since.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd her family has accepted her new lifestyle. \u201cI knew that they\u2019d be a little shocked when I told them about my adult work,\u201d she says.
