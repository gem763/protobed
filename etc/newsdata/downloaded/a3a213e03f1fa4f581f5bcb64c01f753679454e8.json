She said the prime minister called their mother the day of the sentencing to let her know that he will do everything he can to have her released as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI feel incredibly terrible and sad and heartbroken for her,\u201d Gold told Fox News. \u201cShe is very strong but she won\u2019t survive there much longer.\u201d\n\nAMERICAN-BORN ISRAELI WOMAN, 25, DETAINED IN RUSSIA FOR 4 MONTHS OVER 9 GRAMS OF CANNABIS\n\nIssachar, who was born and raised in Fair Lawn, N.J., and moved to Israel when she was 16, was returning home April 9 after a three-month trip to India, Gold said. Issachar, who has served in the Israeli army, was stopped by police at the Moscow airport as she boarded her connecting flight to Tel Aviv, brought into an interrogation room and was told cannabis had been found in her checked bag.\n\nIssachar said she accidentally left the cannabis in her bag, her sister said. The 26-year-old was initially charged with cannabis possession, but the charge was upgraded in May to smuggling drugs into Russia.\n\nGold told Fox News her mother, Yaffa Issachar, who lives in Israel, has been in Russia for the past six months and plans to be there until her sister gets released.\n\nShe said her mother spoke with her sister, who was \u201cshocked and scared\u201d when she learned her fate, \u201cbut she knows we are doing everything we can to get her out.\u201d\n\nNETANYAHU'S CHIEF RIVAL, GANTZ, REJECTS PM'S APPEAL FOR UNITY GOVERNMENT IN ISRAEL\n\nTapes of Issachar's hearings were released on Saturday night on Channel 12 in Israel, which show the 26-year-old telling the Russian judge, \"I am aware that I acted irresponsibly before my flight, that I should have been aware of all of the items I have on my person. That is the reason that I took full responsibility for Charge 228 (possession) in my first trial in April,\" The Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nGold told Fox News her sister denied charge 229, which is the smuggling charge.\n\nNetanyahu's office said the prime minister \"personally intervened on behalf of Naama Issachar in recent weeks,\" according to The Jerusalem Post.\n\nNetanyahu reportedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Issachar's case when he visited Sochi last month and brought the topic up again during a telephone conversation this week.\n\n\u201cI think the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. I think it\u2019s extreme and inhumane and she\u2019s more than paid the price for what she did,\u201d Gold told Fox News reacting to her sister\u2019s sentencing.\n\n\u201cWe continue to urge the Israeli government and the prime minister to continue to be involved in her case because she is being treated unjustly and unfairly in our opinion.\u201d\n\nGold said she is \u201cvery happy and very grateful\u201d that Netanyahu is involved and taking \u201ca deep interest in my sister.\u201d She added that she is optimistic they will find a way for her to get out of prison.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe will never stop until she\u2019s out,\u201d Gold said.", "description": "A 26-year-old woman with dual American and\u00a0Israeli\u00a0citizenship who has been jailed\u00a0in Russia since April after authorities allegedly found nine grams of\u00a0cannabis in her luggage, has been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison, her sister said.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
