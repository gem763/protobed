The 1st arrondissement, which contains the world-famous Louvre museum, saw a rise of 40 per cent.\n\nThere is now an average of 650 offences of property damage every single day in the French capital. In the 4th arrondissement, cases have jumped by 31 per cent.\n\nMayor of the 15th arrondissement Philippe Goujon, a member of the centre-right Republicans, called for a plan to stop the high number of burglaries.\n\n\u201cIt is time to adopt a plan against burglaries in Paris, with a real task force and resolute action against these networks of the former Eastern and Balkan countries who scour entire neighbourhoods of our cities, playing with our weak laws,\u201d Mr Goujon said.\n\nParis District Residents Feel \u2018Abandoned\u2019 as Crime Surges https://t.co/Ce9HaLHGlF \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 25, 2019\n\nWhile there is a possibility that the weekly Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vest) protests have diverted police away from crimes, several crimes have gone down since the start of the year. Armed robberies have declined by 15.3 per cent, and car theft is down by 7.8 per cent.\n\nThe figures follow reports from earlier in the year that showed crimes such as sex attacks on the public transport system had increased by as much as 30 per cent in 2018.\n\nResidents of the heavily migrant-populated 18th arrondissement went as far as to claim they felt abandoned by authorities due to the surge in crime in their area.\n\nKarim Drif, a local business owner in the area, was even forced to close his restaurant due to the rise in violence.\n\n\u201cThis restaurant was my life, my story\u2026 But I\u2019m worn out. What do I do when knives fly around customers? When they have lunch on the terrace two metres away from drug traffickers?\u201d he said.", "description": "Crime statistics in Paris show a continued surge in violent crime, with some areas seeing as much as a 70 per cent rise in violent incidents.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/police-arrest-handcuffs-file-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
