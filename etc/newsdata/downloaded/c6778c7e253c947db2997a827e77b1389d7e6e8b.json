He left the field on a stretcher in Kumagaya.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a complete rupture of his MCL (medial collateral ligament) in his knee,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cHe caught his foot in the ground and twisted his right knee in the tackle.\u201d\n\nAmosa traveled with the squad to Kobe on Wednesday, reportedly moving around in a wheelchair, and is expected to leave Japan soon.\n\nSamoa also has concerns for hooker Motu Matu\u2019u and scrumhalf Dwayne Polataivao, who both have symptoms of concussion. And Matu\u2019u and center Rey Lee-Lo have been cited for dangerous tackles versus Russia and face disciplinary hearings and possible bans.\n\nSamoa still has its hardest games to come, against Scotland next in Kobe on Monday night and then host Japan and No. 2-ranked Ireland. Samoa could have captain and back-rower Jack Lam back from injury for the Scotland game to fill the hole left by Amosa.\n\nWith Amosa confirmed out, Polataivao is a doubt for the Scotland game and Matu\u2019u and Lee-Lo, who was also a try-scorer against Russia, could be suspended for the rest of the pool stage depending on how seriously disciplinary officials view their infractions.\n\nAustralia wing Reece Hodge was suspended for three games and misses the rest of the pool stage for his dangerous high tackle on Fiji\u2019s Peceli Yato.\n\nMatu\u2019u and Lee-Lo were both yellow-carded for their shoulder-led hits to the head of Russia captain Vasily Artemyev within two minutes of each other. They could have been red cards but Artemyev ducked into the tackles both times.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really stop the boys hitting hard,\u201d Samoa center Henry Taefu said. \u201cIt\u2019s in our nature.\u201d\n\nMaybe, but Samoa must be aware that World Rugby is clamping down on dangerous tackles, especially at its marquee event.\n\nSamoa winger Ed Fidow also received a citing commissioner warning after the Russia game for punching. Fidow scored two of Samoa\u2019s six tries against Russia.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Samoa could lose four front-line players for the game against Scotland at the Rugby World Cup, the first of three tough tests remaining in its pool.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/aptopix_japan_rugby_wcup_russia_samoa_30481_c0-100-3820-2327_s1770x1032.jpg?5562595db85f06a656f7c70c0c8944be82cce6e1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
