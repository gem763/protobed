The country was still \"working to know exactly the launch point\", a spokesman said.\n\nThe US has also said Iran was responsible. Senior officials have told US media outlets they had evidence the attacks originated in the south of Iran.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Saudi Arabia says the direction of the strikes showed the missiles could not have come from Yemen\n\nIran has repeatedly denied any role in the strikes, with President Hassan Rouhani calling the attacks a reciprocal act by the \"Yemeni people\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the strikes \"an act of war\".\n\nMr Zarif warned on Twitter that Iran had no desire for war but \"we will not hesitate to defend ourselves\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, said it expects oil output to return to pre-attack levels by the end of September.\n\nWhat's the background to all this?\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia. They are in conflict with a Saudi-led coalition which backs a president who the rebels had forced to flee when the Yemeni conflict escalated in March 2015.\n\nIran is the regional rival of Saudi Arabia and an opponent of the US, which pulled out of a treaty aimed at limiting Tehran's nuclear programme after Mr Trump took power.\n\nUS-Iran tensions have risen markedly this year.\n\nThe US said Iran was behind attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as on another four in May.
