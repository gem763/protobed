You're not meant to understand the minutiae of legalisms. No, you're just supposed to believe that big oil is bad. That will be the takeaway from this charade. Big oil lies, so take them to the cleaners, take their money, ruin them.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal Editorial Board covered the opening on the trial, writing \"This saga began more than three years ago when 20 state AGs and Al Gore held a press conference to launch an investigation into unproven newspaper claims that Exxon had hidden from the public evidence of climate harm it knew to be true.\"\n\nVarney called the effort a, \"legal assault on fossil fuels,\" adding that the \"climate warriors are not doing that well with voters, so they've gone to court.\"\n\nVARNEY WARNS 2020 DEMOCRATS AFTER REPORTS SHOW MIDDLE-CLASS INCOMES SPIKING UNDER TRUMP\n\n\"This is what happens when progressives use the courts for their own political purposes,\" he continued. \"Injustice and lousy economics. That's what you get. Where's the progress in ruining the energy companies which fuel America's prosperity? What do you think $10 [per gallon] gas would do to working families because that's what we're going to get if progressives get their way.\"\n\nExxon Mobil told FOX Business that it met its responsibility to shareholders and argued that the case is politically motivated.\n\n\"Here's the bottom line. The left has latched on to climate change,\" Varney concluded. \"The issue is a Trojan horse. They scream about the end of the world and use that scare for the socialists to take over the economy. The Exxon show trial is just a part of the whole sorry mess.\"\n\nTo see Stuart Varney's full remarks on \"My Take\", and for more episodes of his daily commentary, visit Fox Nation and join today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.
