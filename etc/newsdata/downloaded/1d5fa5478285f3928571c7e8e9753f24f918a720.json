But weak economic data out of China this week\u2014amid little sign the country is ready to unleash broad-based stimulus\u2014could limit further gains, especially as another tranche of tariffs is expected to go into effect Oct. 1.\n\nThe iShares MSCI China exchange-traded fund (ticker: MCHI) is up about 9% since its Aug. 5 low, about twice as much as the S&P 500. The gains belie the cracks emerging in business and consumer confidence in China, and signs of trouble ahead if the U.S. and China don\u2019t resolve the trade uncertainty.\n\n\u201cWe simply cannot afford any further delay or escalation of tensions,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in a statement Tuesday as he led a delegation of chief executives to China for high-level talks. \u201cIn the absence of progress in the negotiations, we face the risk of severe damage to our economies, with the possibility of contagion spreading world-wide. We are already seeing spillover effects that are undermining other aspects of the bilateral relationship\u2014from education exchange to clean tech cooperation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, such a fallout has been the bigger fear among those who have warned that the U.S.-China conflict goes well beyond trade. China watchers have warned of a larger technology Cold War that could chill innovation on both sides of the world, hurting economic growth and further delaying the rollout of new technologies such as 5G.\n\nThe trade uncertainty has already cast a pall over business confidence, with UBS Global Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele warning clients in a note that trade tensions pose a risk to job growth, which was slower than expected in August, which could in turn dampen consumer spending, one of the bright spots in the U.S. economy.\n\nOnly a quarter of business owners surveyed by UBS said they planned to increase hiring, down from 46% last quarter. Less than a quarter said they were looking to invest more in their companies, down from 36% last quarter. Nearly 70% of those surveyed said the trade conflict has had a negative effect on the U.S. and global economies.\n\nChina\u2019s latest economic data reflected some of that impact, with exports falling 1% from a year earlier and imports falling 5.6% in August. Even more troubling: August producer-price index data declined 0.8% from a year earlier\u2014the biggest drop in the barometer of corporate profitability since 2016. Unable to sell as much to the U.S.\u2014and with weaker demand out of Europe as the region\u2019s economies also slow\u2014China faces a stockpile of manufactured goods, forcing it to cut prices and creating a deflationary situation that also dents profitability, says Rory Green, an economist at TS Lombard. That in turn makes it harder for companies to pay down debt, which could add to the already record amount of corporate defaults, Green adds.\n\nThe services industry, which represents 60% of China\u2019s gross domestic product and is the source of the bulk of new job creation, is also slowing. Wage growth is decelerating even though unemployment has held up relatively well as companies have reduced hours instead of laying off workers and the government has let them reduce pension and health-care benefits to make it easier to keep them on the payroll. The slowdown will make it harder for the economy to recover.\n\nWhile China continues to introduce stimulus measures, including cuts to banks\u2019 reserve requirements, it isn\u2019t more selective than it has been in the past. And it is unlikely to bring out the massive stimulus to save the day that it did in 2015 and 2016 unless unemployment rises sharply, corporate defaults soar, or PPI contracts by 2% or more, Green says.\n\n\u201cIn the past, when the economy slowed, China has had to step up stimulus measures because the Communist Party\u2019s prestige is tied into the economy and growth,\u201d Green says. \u201cBut with the trade war, officials have a scapegoat, so they are taking this opportunity to let growth slow to a more sustainable level and not create any asset bubbles by introducing major new stimulus measures.\u201d\n\nThat could be good for China\u2019s long-term debt situation, but could be a disappointment for investors. Goldman Sachs, for example, is overweight China equities, citing better-than-expected earnings growth from Chinese companies versus others in the region, valuations that are still at the low end of historical ranges, and more supportive monetary and fiscal policy. But China\u2019s earnings look better in part because of the pain suffered by Korean and Taiwanese technology companies, which have a heavy weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets index.\n\nThere is one clear way Chinese stocks could keep rising: a trade truce that could improve flagging consumer confidence. Though Matthews Asia\u2019s Andy Rothman doesn\u2019t expect such a truce in early October, when the two sides are set to next meet, he sees enough time to craft a deal in time for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in mid-November, when China President Xi Jinping may meet with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to people in both governments and continue to believe both sides want to do a deal. They are just struggling to figure out how to get there,\u201d Rothman says.\n\nOf course, they have been struggling with that for a while now, much to investors\u2019 dismay.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management conducted a survey of business owners in which only a quarter said they planned to increase hiring.
