The national average previously reached a low of 686 in October of 2009, at the tail end of the Great Recession. Last year\u2019s average was 704.\n\nA score within the range of 670 to 739 is considered \u201cgood,\u201d according to FICO, while the 740 to 799 range is \u201cvery good\u201d and 800-plus is \u201cexceptional.\u201d\n\nThere appear to be two key economic drivers contributing to these steadily rising scores, Ethan Dornhelm, the vice president of FICO scores and predictive analytics, told MarketWatch in an email. One is a \u201cstable and growing economy driving low unemployment, higher wages, and greater financial health,\u201d he said.\n\nBut there\u2019s one more reason that goes beyond the obvious more robust economic backdrop, Dornhelm said: There\u2019s also heightened consumer awareness of FICO scores, he said, pointing to a 2018 Sallie Mae study that found customers who frequently check their FICO scores are more responsible with their finances.\n\nThere were other structural reasons for the rise. \u201cNegative information has been removed from credit files, driven both by the Fair Credit Reporting Act-mandated requirement to purge negative information from consumer credit files after 7 years, as well as by refined reporting standards implemented by the credit bureaus,\u201d Dornhelm added.\n\nDornhelm cited the National Consumer Assistance Plan was an effort led by Equifax EFX, +0.85% , TransUnion TRU, -0.28% and Experian EXPGY, +0.00% to make credit scores more accurate, in part by removing data such as medical debts.\n\nThe score provided by FICO, named for the Fair Isaac Corporation, is widely used as a measure of a person\u2019s creditworthiness \u2014 in other words, his or her reliability in paying back loans \u2014 for lending decisions like auto loans and mortgages.\n\nThe average-score increase is due to score improvement rather than score inflation, Dornhelm said. \u201cIn comparing the average U.S. consumer credit profile between 2009 and 2019, the 20-point increase in average score is driven by clear improvements across most key dimensions of the consumers\u2019 credit profile,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot only are account-level delinquencies down by double-digit percentages relative to 2009, but other key factors such as credit-seeking activity and the ratio of balances to credit limits on card accounts are substantially improved as well,\u201d Dornhelm added.\n\n\u201cThe ratio of balances to credit limits on card accounts (also known as credit-card utilization ratio) is a key driver of the FICO score, where lower ratios represent better repayment likelihood. This utilization ratio is down 28% over the past decade,\u201d she said.\n\nFICO scores, which can be industry-specific and are calculated using data from the major credit bureaus Experian, TransUnion and Equifax, tend to range from 300 to 850. They incorporate payment history, amounts owed on accounts, the length of a person\u2019s credit history, number of new credit accounts and the mix of credit.\n\nMillennials, who have had less time to build up a solid credit history, tend to have lower credit scores on average than their older counterparts. Millennials\u2019 average FICO score in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 665, according to Experian, compared to baby boomers\u2019 732 and the silent generation\u2019s 756.\n\nShares of Equifax, TransUnion and Experian have been up 50%, 46% and 26% respectively this year to date, compared to a 15% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.26% and an 18% increase the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.23%", "description": "The score provided by FICO, named for the Fair Isaac Corporation, is widely used as a measure of a person\u2019s creditworthiness.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR019_fico_ZG_20190910123143.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
