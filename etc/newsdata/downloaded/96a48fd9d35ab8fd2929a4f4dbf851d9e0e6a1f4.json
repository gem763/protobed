And let me say these are career-limiting papers that are sent,\" the former officer replied.\n\nMr Dale was charged in 2009 with the murders of police informers Terence and Christine Hodson five years prior.\n\nBut the allegations were later dropped after the prison murder of underworld killer Carl who had implicated the former detective in the Hodson killings.\n\nMs Gobbo was deregistered as a source so she could be a witness in the prosecution.", "description": "It was considered", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
