We\u2019ve usually got the kids with us. He\u2019s very sensible, but when he\u2019s on the show he goes back to being a boy in a car. He loves it. It\u2019s his dream job.\u2019\n\n\u2018I just want him to be sensible\u2019 (Picture: FARRELL / BACKGRID)\n\nAnd Christine \u2013 who shares twins Penelope and Leo, six, and Felicity, three, with Paddy \u2013 has reasons to be fearful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEx-cricketer Freddie, 41, has already had two accidents on the show.\n\nAlthough it hasn\u2019t put him off as he was back driving again just days after the second crash, which happened during a drag race.\n\nPaddy started presenting on Top Gear in 2018 (Picture: Ashley Knotek/REX (9940027d)\n\nThe cricketer was driving a trike when it veered off the track at Elvington Airfield, near York, at high speed while filming Top Gear.\n\nOne witness even said at the time that Freddie \u2018is lucky to be alive\u2019.\n\nAnd how can we forget when former Top Gear host Richard Hammond, 49, was in a coma for two weeks after a 288mph crash.\n\nThe near-death accident back in 2006 left Richard with memory loss and unable to recognise his wife, Mindy.\n\nThe news also follows after former host Jeremy Clarkson couldn\u2019t help but make a dig at Paddy earlier this week on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.\n\nThe TV presenter quizzed a potential millionaire quizzer on the history of the phrase \u2018No Likey, No Lighty\u2019 \u2013 which until his move to Top Gear, was Paddy McGuinness\u2019s signature catchphrase from dating show, Take Me Out.\n\nHopeful Ross Arnett had got to the \u00a31000 question when asked, and clearly was a fan as he managed to get the correct answer quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the win, Jeremy chucked on his shady glasses for the next question and casually asked: \u2018What happened to the host of that\u2026?
