Millions of lives will be saved.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pence and Erdo\u011fan agree on ceasefire plan but Kurds reject 'occupation'\n\nThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, also scored a quick win. The threat of US administration sanctions was suspended and his occupation of the Turkish-Syrian border zone was given an extra layer of respectability.\n\nOtherwise it was hard to pinpoint what the 13-point document produced in Ankara actually meant. It was agreed between Turkey and the US, which has withdrawn its troops from the contested area.\n\nWashington had been in touch with the actual combatants on the ground, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), but appears to have sold them a completely different deal.\n\nThe SDF commander, Mazloum Kobani, said he had agreed with the Americans that there would be a ceasefire in two areas about 100km apart, along the border where there was heavy fighting, Ras al-Ain, and Tal Abyad.\n\n\u201cAs far as he is concerned the ceasefire is only where there\u2019s active fighting and he totally rejects the idea of any kind of withdrawal, any removal of heavy weapons,\u201d said Charles Lister, a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute. \u201cSo everyone seems to be talking a different language, which can only spell more trouble.\u201d\n\nThe Ankara document envisages a 120-hour ceasefire in a \u201csafe zone\u201d that would be \u201cprimarily enforced by the Turkish armed forces\u201d. The size of this \u201csafe zone\u201d is not defined. The phrase had been used to define a narrow strip of land along the border that was jointly patrolled by the Turks and US troops under an agreed joint security mechanism.\n\nWho is in control in north-eastern Syria?\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish.\n\nSince the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.\n\nThat leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the SDF come to control the region?\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\n\nIn late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does Turkey oppose the Kurds?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey.\n\nTurkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.", "description": "Trump hails ceasefire and \u2018safe zone\u2019 on Turkey-Syria border as \u2018great day for civilisation\u2019 but few believe itTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters in the border town of Tal Abyad.
