Bordentown, located outside the state capital of Trenton, is 77 percent white and 13 percent black.\n\nThe allegations represent striking racism from a jurisdiction\u2019s top law enforcement officer and nod at the racial tensions underlying the 2016 presidential election. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies were overwhelmingly white, while Clinton, the Democratic nominee, emphasized racial issues during some of the biggest speeches of her campaign.\n\nAD\n\nN.J. police chief said black people are \u2018like ISIS\u2019 and he\u2019d like to be \u2018on the firing squad,\u2019 feds say\n\nNucera\u2019s comment about Trump came after a sergeant brought up the teenager\u2019s arrest as he covertly recorded the chief, according to NJ.com. Sgt. Nathan Roohr and the FBI decided to tell Nucera a falsehood that the teenager\u2019s family planned to sue the police department.\n\nAD\n\nRoohr mentioned that Nucera allegedly had slammed the teen\u2019s head into a doorjamb and said the teen\u2019s family had recorded the incident, NJ.com reported.\n\n\u201cIf they took that video and screen-shotted it with your hand on his head, that\u2019s ugly,\u201d Roohr said on the audio recording, according to NJ.com.\n\n\u201cRemember they\u2019re the ones that started the fight and hurt Shawn, and Shawn went to the hospital,\u201d Nucera reportedly responded, referring to another officer involved in the arrest. \u201cHe was resisting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRocco Cipparone, an attorney for Nucera, told The Washington Post he asked the jury to distinguish between criminal justice and social justice. Nucera losing his job and being vilified by the public constitute the social justice response to his racist words, Cipparone said. But criminal justice applies only if Nucera slammed the teen\u2019s head for racially motivated reasons.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat I told the jury is that I think the prosecution wants to keep shoving the words down the jury\u2019s throat to deflect from the inadequacies of proof that Frank Nucera ever laid hands on (the teenager),\" Cipparone said.\n\nThe latest tool to help police develop empathy for the public: Virtual reality headsets\n\nThe arrest in question began when the manager at a Ramada hotel in Bordentown called police to say two young people had failed to pay for their room the previous night and were now swimming in the pool, the criminal complaint says. Two police officers went to the hotel and tried to question the 18-year-old and a 16-year-old girl, the complaint says, but the conversation became a physical altercation.\n\nAD\n\nThe teenagers allegedly resisted arrest, and an officer used pepper spray on the 18-year-old. Nucera and other officers arrived at the Ramada as backup and placed the teens under arrest.\n\nAD\n\nAs officers guided the 18-year-old toward the stairwell door, the complaint says he stopped and shouted at the officers. One officer put his hand on the teen\u2019s back and pushed him forward. Then Nucera allegedly grabbed the teenager\u2019s head and slammed it into the doorjamb, although the teen had not been struggling, according to the complaint.\n\nThe teenager later complained of head pain and a possible concussion but ultimately declined to go to the hospital.\n\nNucera resigned from the police department in early 2017 when he discovered the FBI was investigating him, NJ.com reported. He was arrested months later.\n\nAD\n\nNucera collects an annual pension of nearly $106,000, public records show.\n\nRead more:\n\nA former police chief robbed two banks, authorities say.
