I still car share now,\" she said.\n\n(Image: \u00a9 Terry Harris)\n\nThe next cost to cut was clothes.\n\n\"Before saving for a house I used to spend \u00a3100 a month on clothes because if I went out I would wear something new,\" Molly said.\n\n\"I switched to getting my clothes from car boot sales and now I never buy anything new and spend about \u00a340 a month.\n\n\"I used to get three new things for \u00a3100 but with car boots I get about 20 things for my budget.\"\n\nCosmetics came next.\n\n\"After a bit of research, I also downshifted my cosmetics to save cash,\" she said.\n\n\"For example, I use a hot cloth cleanser from Aldi that costs \u00a33.99 when the Liz Earle equivalent is \u00a324.\"\n\n(Image: \u00a9 Terry Harris)\n\nBy the end of all the cost-cutting, it was time to work out how to boost her savings.\n\n\"As soon as I moved home I started putting \u00a3500 a month into an instant savings account,\" Molly said.\n\n\"Also whatever I had left at the end of the month I transferred across to my savings account which was usually another \u00a3200.\"\n\nBut as impressive as that was, she found better ways to save.\n\n\"After about a year I joined the Sharesave scheme at work and put the maximum in which was \u00a3250 a month and I reduced my savings to \u00a3250,\" she said.\n\nAnd that work scheme gave her her first savings boost.\n\n\"I managed to save \u00a37,000 over three years in the Sharesave scheme.\"\n\nThat wasn't the only thing she did to up her returns though.\n\n\"I also opened a help-to-buy ISA after I had been at Next for a year and moved \u00a31,000 from my savings into it to get the maximum bonus,\" Molly said.\n\nThe help-to-buy ISA is a Government scheme that adds 25% to your savings if you use them to buy your first home.\n\nThe biggest bonus you can get is \u00a33,000, but that takes 4 years of regular saving. Molly didn't quite manage that, but she did get a boost.\n\n\"By the end I had \u00a31,800 in the ISA and then got my 25% bonus from the Government. It worked out as an extra \u00a3450,\" she explained.\n\n(Image: \u00a9 Terry Harris)\n\nAnd it all added up.\n\n\"In four years I saved \u00a330,000. I used \u00a325,000 for the deposit, \u00a31,345 for fees and the rest was left to buy appliances and other things for the house,\" she said.\n\nAnd that was enough, combined with a mortgage, to buy her first home - a \u00a3195,000 two-bed period terrace opposite a pub.\n\nIt's fair to say the feeling of getting the keys in her hand was worth the sacrifice.\n\n\"It was amazing. I got them after work on a Friday and just went straight into the house,\" Molly said.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it was mine.\"\n\nHer mortgage costs her \u00a3697 a month, but bills are brought down by her boyfriend James Cooke, 28. As they live together, he pays her \u00a3450 a month for his share of the bills.\n\n(Image: \u00a9 Terry Harris)\n\nAnd her advice to anyone trying to follow in in her footsteps?\n\n\"Live at home for as long as you can. If it is possible to live there then just put up with your mum,\" Molly said.\n\n\"It is hard and you don\u2019t have freedom living under their roof, not paying much but it is worth it in the end.\"", "description": "Molly Beard cut back on everything from her car to her clothes and her makeup - as well as taking advantage of all the savings schemes she could", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Terry Harris"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529672.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-My-1st-Mortgage-Molly-and-boyfriend-James-with-Puppy-Poppy-Femail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
