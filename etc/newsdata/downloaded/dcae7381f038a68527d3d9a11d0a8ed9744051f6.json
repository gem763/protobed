That would need a simple majority of MPs.\n\nA Number 10 source said on Sunday that MPs would vote on an election \"so we can get a new Parliament\".\n\nIf the vote was lost, they said the government would then \"look at all options\" including ideas similar to those proposed by other parties.\n\nMPs have already twice rejected a call from the PM to hold a general election.\n\nBrexit deadline\n\nMr Johnson has sent a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit delay until 31 January. He was compelled to do so by a law passed by MPs - known as the Benn Act.\n\nBefore this, the prime minister repeatedly insisted the UK would leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal.\n\nThe UK is still due to leave the EU on Thursday - but EU ambassadors are working on an alternative date.\n\nThe Guardian is reporting a leaked draft of the agreement contains a three-month extension to 31 January.\n\nThe newspaper says the UK could leave earlier - with Brexit taking place on the first day of the month after a deal is ratified. The EU has not commented on the report.\n\nWhat's happening today?\n\nIf there are no urgent questions or statements in the Commons, MPs will begin debating the government's motion at 15:30 GMT.\n\nThis is expected to last for 90 minutes, so a vote on the motion could happen at 17:00.", "description": "MPs will vote on whether to back an election while EU ambassadors meet to agree on a Brexit delay.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/113CA/production/_109420607_8d9439d5-9ee1-45cb-8227-6adc067a6efb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
