(Shelly Hipson/Facebook)\n\n\"Our wharf is 70 years old, it needs a lot of work,\" he said. \"We're looking at a catastrophe one of these days.\"\n\nDoane said because lobster boats are so much bigger than they used to be, the old wharfs are no longer adequate and are more vulnerable to damage in bad weather.\n\n\"Our boats are three times the size they were 20 years ago,\" he said.\n\nIn past storms, water has pooled on the wharf, creating dangerous conditions for fishermen tending to their boats.\n\nBroken timbers under the wharf in Little Harbour, N.S. (Roddy Conrad)\n\nBut Doane said one of the biggest concerns at Ingomar is the rock wall protecting the harbour, which he said is too low and only extends partway across the harbour, leaving an opening for boats to get in and out.\n\nDoane said in bad weather, water rushes in through the opening and creates a \"whirlpool\" in the harbour that knocks the boats around.\n\n\"My boat personally, I've busted the curbs three times,\" he said. \"I have to move now, I can't leave my boat where my designated spot is because the other boats have been busted up.\"\n\nMany boats already out of the water\n\nFor fishermen on the South Shore, the timing of Dorian is fortunate, all things considered.\n\nBecause it isn't currently lobster season, many boats aren't in the water. But even if this isn't the storm that spells disaster, Doane fears that disaster is coming.\n\n\"With some of the wharfs, especially as exposed as Ingomar is, the boats and everything would be destroyed,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, he said boats at Ingomar would be staying put, as the closest safe harbour is two hours away and already overcrowded, which means Doane and other boat owners will be riding out the storm at the wharf.\n\n\"We'll be over there most of the night, making sure our lines don't break,\" he said.\n\nFollow the live weather blog\n\nKeep up to date on Hurricane Dorian with the CBC Maritimes live weather blog, updated every day.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES", "description": "Some communities in southwest Nova Scotia are concerned their aging wharfs could be seriously damaged by Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4678437.1527276121!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wharf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
