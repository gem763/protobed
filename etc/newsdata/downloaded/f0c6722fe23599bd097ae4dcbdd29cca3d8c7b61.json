His dog was found lying next to him and it\u2019s believed the dog starved to death after Heinz\u2019s passing.\n\nResidents of the flat were forced to evacuate the building after a fire broke out in the rubbish room in the cellar of the building two weeks ago.\n\nRescue workers then had to account for the inhabitants in the block of flats. When they broke into Heinz\u2019s apartment they found the skeleton of the 59-year-old man and his dog.\n\nAngelika Havener, who was Heinz\u2019s neighbour and claimed to be good friends with him, revealed that she reported him missing to police but accused them of not following up on her suspicions and not checking up on him in his flat.\n\nBut another neighbour reportedly told the police that Heinz was with a friend in M\u00fcnster, and the case was shelved.\n\n\u201cHe was a nice guy, a bit of a loner . . . He told me he left his job as a baker as he had an allergy to flour dust,\u201d she Angelika.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve to die the way he did.\u201d\n\nHis body is being examined and police are investigating the case.\n\nSources: Magazine Features", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9437/5f7bbcca856341648f75d7f38149ee62.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
