The country was also the first in the world to commercialize a 5G network in April this year.Korea also ranked sixth for infrastructure and innovation capability and eighth for public health. Singapore ranked first in this year\u2019s index, followed by the United States with second place and Hong Kong with third place.The report, however, suggested that Korea\u2019s rank could be higher if it improves its competitiveness in domestic competition and the labor market. The index placed Korea 59th for market efficiencies and 66th for domestic competition.The WEF added that Korea\u2019s labor market is suffering from conflictual industrial relations and comparatively poor workers\u2019 rights protections.In response to the report, the Ministry of Economy and Finance said Wednesday that it will work to innovate regulations and improve the country\u2019s labor market for better competitiveness. The government has been looking to revise some of its labor laws that will strengthen workers\u2019 rights as it pushes to meet key International Labour Organization conventions.The ministry also said it will fast-track investments into innovative platforms and new industries to strengthen Korea\u2019s innovation capabilities.BY KO JUN-TAE [ko.juntae@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
