This means hundreds of American jobs in Austin and for suppliers across the Country. Congratulations to the Apple team and their workers!\" he wrote.\n\nBut on the same day, the US Trade Representative's office denied a request from Apple to be exempted from a 25% tariff on five Mac Pro components made in China, Bloomberg reports.\n\nThese parts include: the Mac Pro's optional wheels, a circuit board for managing the input and output ports, a power adapter, the charging cable, and a processor cooling system.\n\nApple\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the five parts which didn't gain exemptions were rejected because Apple \"failed to show that the imposition of additional duties on the particular product would cause severe economic harm to you or other US interests.\"\n\nThe news is the latest in a confusing, months-long saga that has seen Trump veer between threats and celebration about Apple's decision to keep making the Mac Pro in Texas rather than China, against the backdrop of the ongoing trade war.\n\nApple has been making the Mac Pro in Texas since 2013 but, in June this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that the firm was moving the process to China.\n\nPresident Trump pounced on the report and threatened tariffs on any Apple products made in China.\n\nHe wrote in July that Apple would not be granted a tariff waiver.\n\nTrump later appeared to soften those threats, saying: \"I think they're going to announce they're going to build a plant in Texas.\" It isn't clear whether this was referring to Apple's existing Texas facility.\n\nApple has also been affected by 15% tariffs that kicked in earlier this month, which has hit products including the Apple Watch and AirPods. The iPhone is expected to be impacted from December.", "description": "The US Trade Representative's office denied a request from Apple to have five China-made components of the Mac Pro exempted from a 25% tariff.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5978ec115d8a2f20008b5a50?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
