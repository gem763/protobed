Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Sports Direct International Plc founder Mike Ashley, according to excerpts emailed by the party. He\u2019ll also reiterate Labour\u2019s plans to nationalize rail, mail and water companies.\n\n\u201cThis election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country, take on the vested interests holding people back and ensure that no community is left behind,\u201d Corbyn will say. \u201cWe\u2019re going after the tax dodgers. We\u2019re going after the dodgy landlords. We\u2019re going after the bad bosses. We\u2019re going after the big polluters.\u201d\n\nCorbyn\u2019s core message -- a pledge to stand with the \u201cmany\u201d and not the \u201cprivileged few,\u201d is an echo of the themes he used to some effect in the 2017 election, confounding the polls to deprive then- Prime Minister, Theresa May, of her majority. Trailing in the polls again, this time he hopes to go a step further and take office.\n\nWhen Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins,\u201d Corbyn is to say, according to the excerpts. \u201cWe all win.\u201d\n\nJohnson called the election to break the deadlock in Parliament, which has failed over the past three years to pass a deal to take the U.K. out of the European Union and deliver on the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nThe prime minister says if he wins a majority, he\u2019ll push through his deal and deliver Brexit by the new deadline of Jan. 31. Corbyn, for his part, says he\u2019ll renegotiate the deal and then put the resulting agreement to a new in-out referendum.\n\n\u201cA vote for Labour is not a vote for change,\u201d Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said in a statement responding to Corbyn\u2019s expected remarks. \u201cIt is precisely the opposite: a vote for more delay and uncertainty on Brexit, meaning the government can\u2019t focus on people\u2019s priorities, like the NHS, schools and crime.\u201d\n\nThe House of Lords late on Wednesday approved the bill setting the date of the early election, and Parliament is likely to be dissolved early next week for the official campaign to begin.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Jeremy Corbyn will blast what he calls the U.K.\u2019s \u201ccorrupt system\u201d as he kick-starts Labour\u2019s campaign to overthrow Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives in the Dec. 12 general election.The opposition Labour Party leader will deliver his first speech of the campaign with an attack", "authors": ["Alex Morales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
