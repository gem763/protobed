Responsibility was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen\u2019s civil war.\n\nAnalysts cast doubt on how hard the new measures would hit Tehran given that earlier sanctions have already dried up Iranian oil revenues and cut Iranian banks\u2019 ties to the financial world.\n\nAnd Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called on the Pentagon to present Trump with a wide range of options that would punish Iran and warned that the United States has \u201clost deterrence\u201d with Tehran.\n\nThe fresh sanctions target the Central Bank of Iran, the National Development Fund of Iran and Etemad Tejarate Pars Co, an Iranian company that U.S. officials said is used to conceal financial transfers for Iranian military purchases, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThese are the highest sanctions ever imposed on a country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad what\u2019s happening with Iran. It\u2019s going to hell, doing poorly, practically broke, they are broke,\u201d he said. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Washington had now cut off \u201call source of funds to Iran.\u201d\n\nTrump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year and ramped up sanctions to strangle oil exports, a mainstay of the economy. The move dismantled part of former President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy and upset U.S. allies who were party to the agreement, which was designed to restrict Tehran\u2019s pathway to a nuclear bomb in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nAmir Paivar, a London-based market analyst, said that while targeting a central bank seems important the latest move was mostly cosmetic.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s oil export proceeds are usually deposited in Central Bank accounts around the world, therefore the bank has central importance,\u201d Amir Paivar, a London-based market analyst said.\n\n\u201cBut with Iran\u2019s oil exports at a minimum, and with global banks not working with Iranian counterparts, designating the Central Bank again is little more than cosmetic.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s wide range of sanctions are part of a U.S. campaign to increase economic pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program and regional ambitions and was championed by former national security adviser John Bolton, who was ousted this month.\n\nPrevious U.S. sanctions have also targeted Iran\u2019s foreign minister, its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, space agencies, and various networks Washington has said helped boost Iran\u2019s nuclear program, among others.\n\n\u201cRegardless of transparent attempts to shift blame, the evidence points to Iran\u2014and only Iran,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement following the announcement.\n\nLIMITED IMPACT\n\nTrump, who spoke to reporters at the White House alongside visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, has said he wants a peaceful solution following the weekend oil attacks. Pompeo had called the attacks an \u201cact of war.\u201d\n\nAsked about the possibility of a military response on Iran, Trump said the United States was always prepared and that a military strike was always a possibility. He is expected to meet with his national security team on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis was an understandable action to take but is unlikely to have much impact,\u201d Samantha Sultoon, visiting senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \u201cMost transactions were already prohibited because the Iranian central bank was already designated under the other sanctions authorities,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRedesignating the Central Bank under counterterrorism authorities will have limited, though perhaps some, impact,\u201d she added.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man walks past the Central bank of Iran in Tehran, Iran August 1, 2019.
