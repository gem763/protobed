But on health care, she's with Bernie.\n\nWarren, a Massachusetts senator and a leading liberal Democratic presidential candidate, has stood out in the 2020 race for her extraordinary focus on detailed plans to address the nation's most pressing issues. Her website lists specific policies for 43 topics, from gun violence and Social Security to the Electoral College and family farmers.\n\nBut on health care, an issue that matters the most to many voters, Warren is all in on her opponent Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan.\n\nThe seeming inconsistency was highlighted during this past week's presidential debate by Democratic front-runner Joe Biden as he defended his own plan to expand the health care overhaul put in place while Barack Obama was president.\n\n\"The senator says she's for Bernie,\" Biden quipped. \"Well, I'm for Barack.\"\n\nNo issue has defined the early months of the nomination fight more than health care, which has emerged as a powerful proxy in the broader fight for the party's soul in the age of Trump.\n\nThe issue is a delicate one for Warren. She needs to unify the progressive wing behind her candidacy to overtake Biden in the primary, if she is to emerge as the nominee against President Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nMedicare for All is Sanders' signature issue, and as such, she can ill afford any daylight on health care between her and Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, if she ultimately hopes to win over his supporters.\n\nOn such a critical issue, Warren allies believe there's no incentive to complicate the debate with a new plan.\n\n\"Making clear that they're aligned on the North Star goal of Medicare for All is an important long-term investment in her relationship with Sanders' voters \u2014 as well as an important short-term investment in clarity for all voters,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a vocal Warren supporter.\n\nIndeed, the internal battle over health care has two very clear factions.\n\nBiden leads those who prefer to leave the private insurance market in place but give people the choice to join a government-backed \"public option.\" Sanders leads the approach, which would replace the private insurance market altogether with a single-payer health care system requiring virtually no out-of-pocket costs.\n\nFrom the beginning, Warren has been clearly aligned with Sanders' faction. Yet some of Sanders' supporters are not yet convinced that she's as committed to Medicare for All as the plan's author. Progressive critics noted, for example, that Warren indicated she supported \"a lot of plans\" when asked about health care in an interview after the debate.\n\n\"I support Medicare for All. I think it's a good plan. And look, I support a lot of plans \u2014 other things that people have come up with. When they're good plans, let's do it,\" Warren told CBS. \"This isn't some kind of contest (where) I got to think of mine first. It's what's best for the American people.\"\n\nA spokeswoman later clarified that Warren does not support any plans on health care and that the senator's reference to supporting \"a lot of plans\" applied only to other policies.\n\nNina Turner, who co-chairs Sanders' campaign, applauded Warren's consistent public embrace of Medicare for All.\n\n\"For Sen. Sanders, it's a beautiful thing to have a fellow progressive follow his lead on the signature issue of his campaign,\" Turner said.\n\nBut she suggested that only Sanders is invested enough in the plan to ensure it ultimately becomes law.\n\n\"He's the only one who will see it through all the way to the end,\" she said. \"This is in his bones.\"\n\nKatherine Brezler, who co-founded the group People for Bernie Sanders, said Warren's embrace of Sanders' health plan has helped maintain good relations between the two competitors and their supporters.\n\n\"I genuinely think that neither camp is really going to have that hard a time voting for the other,\" said Brezler, who helped raise money for Warren's first Senate bid.\n\nWarren's campaign declined to comment for this story aside from pointing to the CBS interview.\n\nDuring the debate, she repeatedly defended her support for the plan, but she let Sanders punch back at Biden when the former vice president raised questions about its cost.\n\nBiden noted Medicare for All would cost taxpayers roughly $30 trillion. A fiery Sanders said the current system would cost $50 trillion while leaving more than 80 million American uninsured or underinsured.\n\nMedicare for All, Sanders said, would cover everyone and eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles and co-payments.\n\n\"I ... wrote the damn bill, if I may say so,\" Sanders said as Warren looked on.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that.
