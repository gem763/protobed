Photo: Netflix\n\nSpoilers below for The Politician.\n\nRyan Murphy\u2019s Netflix series The Politician careens through a lot of story in its first season, including the world\u2019s most contentious student body election, a B plot involving Munchausen by proxy, and a high-school production of the kill-a-president musical Assassins, but the show\u2019s biggest surprise comes in its last episode. Having run through pretty much everything that could happen in an elite California high school, The Politician jumps across the country to New York, where Platt\u2019s character Payton Hobart is now a burned-out NYU student who spends his time performing at a piano bar and hallucinating visions of River (David Corenswet), the bisexual ghost with cute dimples who haunts him. But Payton isn\u2019t playing at any old piano bar. Specifically, he sings a cover of \u201cVienna\u201d at a place soon revealed to be Marie\u2019s Crisis.\n\nFirst of all, excuse me? Marie\u2019s Crisis is a bar where you sing show tunes, and \u201cVienna\u201d is not a show tune, not even if you bend the rules. It wasn\u2019t included in the Billy Joel musical Movin\u2019 Out (and no, Smash season two does not count). Payton performs with what appears to be a well drink with lime on the piano (okay, that is on brand), but The Politician\u2019s version of Marie\u2019s is large enough to fit a whole backing band, which is patently false: On your average night, Marie\u2019s barely has room for anyone who isn\u2019t a gay musical-theater geek, a tourist, or an overly drunk, overenthusiastic straight girl. Most pressingly, why does no one sing along? (Did Payton insist on doing this as a solo?) And where is Payton\u2019s tip jar? That\u2019s just bad piano bar form.\n\nIf The Politician\u2019s tribute to Marie\u2019s is lightly fact-confused, at least it\u2019s also on trend. Earlier this year, the characters on Younger paid their own visit to Marie\u2019s Crisis to sing along to \u201c9 to 5\u201d (not a song written for a musical, but at least a song in a musical), a scene the show filmed in a prettified version of the actual bar. Next year, the CW will premiere the first episode of its Riverdale-goes-to-New York fantasia Katy Keene, which, as seen in the pilot screened at the Tribeca TV Festival, features a location known as \u201cMolly\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d where a drag queen character performs Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s \u201cCut to the Feeling.\u201d That\u2019s not a song in a musical and Marie\u2019s is not a drag bar, but from a universe with a loose grasp of the temperature, this is a relatively accurate reference.\n\nMarie\u2019s is getting a lot of attention at the moment, considering that it\u2019s a little West Village bar best known as a place to scream-belt Little Shop of Horrors. Given this level of attention, I called up one of Marie\u2019s pianists, Franca Vercelloni, to ask why she thinks TV suddenly cares so much about the theater bar. \u201cI try to run it like it is a party where everybody\u2019s invited,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe try to find common ground between whoever might be there in this very diverse crowd of people, who range from professional actors to school teachers to doctors to lawyers. There are not a lot of places in New York where you can feel that way.\u201d It\u2019s a place where you can run into anyone from (fictional) publishing executives to theater professionals to the actual Ben Platt, who has stopped by a couple times, though not on Vercelloni\u2019s shift. (She heard he was nice and just \u201cdid his thing.\u201d)\n\nReferencing the bar is also shorthand for a certain version of New York steeped in gay, 20th-century West Village history \u2014 a history increasingly threatened by the overdevelopment of Manhattan, which means it\u2019s a way for these shows to adopt a little authenticity. In my personal opinion, there\u2019s a bit of melancholy to the reference, too: Here are writers and actors caught up in the ever-expanding gold rush of streaming-era television, looking back on a little New York bar that\u2019s part of the increasingly prettified and threatened world of New York theater. If Baudrillard were a fan of Ahrens and Flaherty deep cuts, he\u2019d have a field day with the difference between Marie\u2019s and the Marie\u2019s simulacra seen on TV.\n\nVercelloni was generally pleased with the attention, but she offered one rule for anybody who\u2019s inspired to visit thanks to a show like The Politician: You\u2019ve got to respect the history of the space. \u201cIt\u2019s a church to me, you know, and I think that the people who come in have to understand that,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, what did she make of the authenticity of the TV versions of the bar? Younger got things most right since they actually shot the show there (even if they did make things pretty), while Katy Keene was more off base, considering the Carly Rae Jepsen and the drag. As for Payton\u2019s performance of \u201cVienna\u201d in The Politician? \u201cWe\u2019ve, we\u2019ve learned to broaden our definition [of what we play],\u201d Vercelloni said, admitting she\u2019ll occasionally play something by Cher. \u201cBilly Joel? That\u2019s a double-digit tip.\u201d So, don\u2019t even mention Payton\u2019s lack of tip jar: \u201cThat\u2019s how we make a living!\u201d", "description": "Younger, The Politician, and even Katy Keene all love this one West Village piano bar.
