The government keeps jamming them down our throats by providing tax subsidies and other perks to companies like Tesla. They cause all sorts of problems. People are sleeping in them. They stink on ice. And, a new poll shows that most do not want them. They are not interested in cars that drive you from Harrisburg, PA to Topeka, KS while you wolf down Tasty Kakes and Yuengling beer with both hands on your food and drink and your eyes watching SportsCenter. More Americans simply want technology that can accurately predict the weather.\n\nA YouGov Poll released Thursday shows that 68 percent of Americans do not want 5G technology if it means having worse weather forecasts. The poll, taken on Sep 24, 2019 of 2805 U.S. adults, asked \"5G technology (the next generation of cell service technology after 4G) could be an important factor in allowing self-driving cars to become accessible. However, 5G technology could also severely interfere with accurate weather forecasting. Would you rather have self-driving cars or accurate weather forecasts?\"\n\nJust 16 percent of Americans wanted self-driving cars.\n\nMore Americans would rather have accurate weather forecasts than self-driving cars. pic.twitter.com/JtGSlzEewu \u2014 Timothy Meads (@Timothy__Meads) September 26, 2019\n\nThis poll comes as a California patrol car had to stop a high-speed chase this week due to his Tesla's car battery running low, showing these vehicles are pretty inefficient.\n\nvia USA Today: The East Bay Times reported that the officer was driving a Tesla Model S during a high-speed chase when he noticed that it was running low on juice. The policeman radioed in to dispatch to say he may need backup if the electric car runs out of power. \u201cI am down to 6 miles of battery on the Tesla, so I may lose it here in a sec,\u201d the officer, identified as Jesse Hartman, reportedly said. \u201cIf someone else is able, can they maneuver into the No. 1 spot?\u201d The police eventually called off the chase after the assailant began driving recklessly through thickening traffic, according to the report. The car was later discovered abandoned in San Jose.\n\nThis poll also raises the question, if Americans don't even trust our current technology to give accurate weather forecasts 10 days from now, why should we trust the Democrats on their global warming predictions 10 years from now?", "description": "If Americans don't even trust our current technology to give accurate weather forecasts 10 days from now, why should we trust the Democrats on their global warming predictions 10 years from now?.09/26/2019 16:50:12PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/256/4f2bc057-4ba1-4825-8b2c-7418556573d2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
