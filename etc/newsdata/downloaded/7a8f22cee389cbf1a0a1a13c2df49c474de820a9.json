Authorities have detained 57 people and may be charged, the interior ministry said.\n\n\"You know that as of today's date \u202aat 2 p.m. the banned DCK in Kazakhsan was called upon to gather... we (the police) asked people to disperse, and those who didn't, were taken to the district offices for questioning,\" Bakytzhan Malybayev, first deputy chief of Nur-Sultan police, told reporters. \"We will carry out questioning and then the people will be released.\"\n\nReuters reporters witnessed several arrests in Nur-Sultan and Almaty. In Kazakhstan's capital Nur-Sultan, police detained a man with a banner reading: \"Let's not give way to Chinese expansion\" and \"The old man is the enemy\", an anti-Nazarbayev slogan. Several people chanted:\"Freedom to political prisoners\".\n\nSome protesters tried to escape as police moved in and smashed the windows of a police bus.\n\nIn Almaty, protesters were quickly taken away to police buses as they began chanting slogans against Chinese expansion and \"Old man, go away!\"\n\nChina is a major investor in Kazakhstan's energy sector and buys oil and gas from the mostly Muslim nation of 18 million, but critics accuse some Chinese companies - as well as Western ones - of hiring too few local staff and paying them less than foreign workers.\n\n(Maria Gordeyeva in Almaty, Tamara Vaal in Nur-Sultan; Writing by Olzhas Auyezov and Andrey Kuzmin, editing by Deepa Babington)", "description": "ALMATY/NUR-SULTAN (Reuters) - Police detained dozens in Kazakhstan's two largest cities on Saturday as they took part in the latest protest against China's influence in the Central Asian republic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
