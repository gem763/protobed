The next morning, I woke with blocked ears and vertigo, so I called in sick to work.\n\n\u2018I put a couple of drops of olive oil in my ears and decided to go back to sleep for a bit \u2013 I could feel tickling in my ear, but put it down to the oil.\n\n\u2018When I woke up a couple of hours later, I could still feel the sensation, but also hear a faint scratching sound, so I decided to investigate with a cotton bud.\n\n\u2018It came out clean, apart from a single leg. It was at that point I thought \u201cOh god, I know what that means\u201d.\n\n\u2018I used a hairpin and the cotton bud to retrieve the spider, making sure to count the legs coming out, then made sure to give my ear a good clean.\n\n\u2018Total sod\u2019s law as I\u2019m an arachnophobe \u2013 absolute nightmare. And the irony is I\u2019m a web designer for a living.\u2019\n\nLiam had not long cleared a nest in his doorway before going to sleep (Picture: SWNS)\n\nHe has now vowed to wear earmuffs in bed (Picture: Liam Gomez/SWNS)\n\nAfterwards Liam joked that the bug might have \u2018snuck\u2019 into his ear \u2018as some sort of revenge mission\u2019 after he cleared their nest.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t think to check if it was female,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m hoping it was male, because I\u2019m really hoping it didn\u2019t have to chance to lay eggs.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
