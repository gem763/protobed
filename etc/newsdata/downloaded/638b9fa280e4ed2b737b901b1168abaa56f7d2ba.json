Perhaps the highest-profile of these is chef-owner Cara Chigazola Tobin, whose Honey Road has garnered two James Beard Award nominations in as many years.\n\nHoney Road, which occupies a prominent corner on the pedestrian Church Street Marketplace, takes its name from an ancient trade route in Turkey. The food is focused on mezze, or Mediterranean small plates, Turkey and Greece\u2019s answer to tapas. One of the only eateries of its kind in New England, it embraces the very Vermont ethos of relying heavily on local sourcing, artisans and farm-to-table ingredients. Best of all, for a place that skews towards the fine-dining end of the spectrum, it is surprisingly affordable.\n\nReason to visit: Sweet harissa chicken wings, homemade pita with shankleesh, falafel, halloumi, Turkish coffee\n\nShankleesh is a strong cheese related to feta that is heavily seasoned with herbs and topped with tomato confit, enjoyed as a spread or dip with fresh pita bread.

This creates a warmer welcome, so you don't feel out of place because you're not a food expert. The staff is excellent at explaining what each dish is like, and since most are smaller plates, you will probably want two to three per person, possibly more.\n\nThe menu is divided into two sections: dips, which are smaller starters, and mezze, which is everything else. Among the dip options are tahini hummus and labne (a thick yogurt sauce similar to tzatziki). Whichever you choose, make sure to order the warm house-made pita bread, the signature starter.\n\nHoney Road's house-made pitas are served warm, intended to be torn up and enjoyed with a variety of interesting dips. (Photo: Larry Olmsted/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nMy favorite dip was the delicious shankleesh, a strong cheese related to feta. It's crusted with tomato and herbs, making it a perfect complement to the pita.\n\nMezze options are listed in ascending order by size, so you know how substantial each is. That said, of the 20 or so options, only the last one \u2013 pide \u2013 is a full-sized entr\u00e9e.\n\nPide is a stuffed flatbread, usually oval-shaped, with folded edges that somewhat resembles a calzone except that the center area is left open and there's no top layer of dough. A beloved Turkish comfort food, it can be filled with all sorts of things, but Honey Road stuffs theirs with local cheese and eggs, house-made lamb sausage and hot peppers.\n\nPerhaps the most popular dish at Honey Road, and also a beloved snack at the bar is the sweet harissa chicken wings, with a dried lime yogurt sauce dip. (Photo: Larry Olmsted/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nAs good as the pide is, it may be too much food unless you have four or more diners. There are several other can\u2019t-miss specialties on the menu, the favorite being the sweet harissa chicken wings. Harissa, a smoky North African hot-pepper paste blended from roasted red peppers, olive oil, cumin and caraway and coriander seeds, is a go-to condiment in Middle Eastern cooking. Honey Road's harissa is a sweeter and less spicy take on the genre, but perfect for an exotic and delicious rendition of an American staple, the hot chicken wing.\n\nHoney Road's deliciously tender falafel is uniquely served as lettuce wraps. (Photo: Larry Olmsted/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nThe fusion of American dishes and Middle Eastern and Mediterranean flavors doesn't end there. Other signature dishes include the lamb slider and the lettuce-wrapped falafel, which is simply the best I've ever had in this country. It's just perfect: firm outside, tender inside without being mushy.\n\nAnother must-try mezze is the halloumi, a Greek specialty cheese that can be grilled without melting. Honey Road takes advantage of its location in one of the world's best cheesemaking regions, sourcing its excellent halloumi from a Vermont dairy farmer. Once it's off the grill, the restaurant improves on it by adding fresh blueberries and honey for a wonderful flavor combination. (As the place\u2019s name suggests, honey is used liberally here.)\n\nAnother must try: Grilled slabs of local Vermont-made halloumi cheese with blueberries and honey. (Photo: Larry Olmsted/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nWhat really wowed me about Honey Road was the way it unexpectedly elevates some pretty simple ingredients. I was dubious when the waiter extolled the virtues of grilled broccoli as a signature item, but I came away astonished as to how good broccoli can taste. The same goes for the baby beets, which are served with a delicious creamy locally made ricotta, almonds and honey, all of which went together perfectly. Though I expected to like the cheese, I wasn\u2019t prepared for how tasty the beets would be.\n\nFor dessert, there are individual ice cream bars with chocolate, tahini, honey caramel and peanuts. (Photo: Larry Olmsted/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nThe desserts were too intriguing to pass up. The stunner is a duo of personal-sized ice cream bars, perfect for sharing, with chocolate, tahini, honey caramel and peanuts. They tasted as great as they looked and went perfectly with a Turkish coffee, which was better than the ones I\u2019ve had in Turkey.\n\nIf you are a coffee lover, this is another must-try. Just fight the temptation to drink it to the last drop since the very finely grounds wind up at the bottom of the cup.\n\nRating: OMG!\n\nPrice: $$\n\nIf you go:\n\n156 Church Street, Burlington\n\n802-497-245\n\nhttps://www.honeyroadrestaurant.com/\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/greatamericanbites/2019/10/16/honey-road-must-try-mediterranean-mezze-burlington-vermont/3976506002/", "description": "Chef-owner Cara Chigazola Tobin fuses small-plate American dishes with Mediterranean flavors using locally sourced Vermont ingredients.", "authors": ["Larry Olmsted", "Special To Usa Today", "Published A.M.
