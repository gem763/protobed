One suspect. And seemingly not a shred of physical evidence linking the accused to the crime.\n\nYet that\u2019s how Nick Hillary, a university soccer coach and father-of-five, found himself at the centre of a homicide investigation in 2011, following the mysterious death of 12-year-old Garrett Phillips in Potsdam, New York and a police investigation that, from all intents and purposes, appeared to be founded on little more than speculation.\n\nThe frenzied hunt for Garrett\u2019s killer raised some troubling questions about why, in the absence of witnesses or evidence, a local African-American man was immediately vilified in a small town populated by mainly white people. Plus, if he was the only person police investigated, who got away while they focused on one suspect?\n\nWho Killed Garrett Phillips examines the twists and turns into the murder investigation of the titular 12-year-old New York schoolboy, who was found dead in his apartment\n\nThis month, a two-part documentary is set to air on Sky Crime, the new home of true crime, examining the case against Hillary, and how eight years later, a heartbroken family and a community in mourning are still trying to answer the titular question: Who Killed Garrett Phillips?\n\nGarrett, 12, was found strangled in his empty home on October 24, 2011, with no witnesses reporting seeing the killer enter or exit the second-floor apartment.\n\nYet somehow, within hours, police had singled out their prime target for the murder investigation: his mother's ex.\n\nSo, what was it that made them point the finger at Nick Hillary? And could the pressure of locals who already seemed to have made their mind up about him have anything to do with the law acting so quickly?\n\nLocal university soccer coach Nick Hillary, the ex-boyfriend of Garrett's mother Tandy, quickly became the only suspect by police in the predominantly white town of Potsdam, New York\n\nHillary had recently separated from Garrett\u2019s mother Tandy Cyrus after their interracial romance came under strain due to opinions of the close-knit community of Potsdam, where other children had allegedly begun to taunt Garrett at school.\n\nCould a rift between Hillary and Garrett be sufficient evidence to make him a suspect, and if so, could police use it to snare the killer in a police interview?\n\nWhat ensued was the first dark twist in this story.\n\nCaught on camera, Hillary was railroaded into a chilling interrogation on his first visit to Potsdam police station the morning after the crime, despite repeated assurances that he was there to help catch the killer - and not to be treated as a suspect.\n\nInstead, he faced a taped police interview before he was then stripped of his clothes and possessions for a full-body examination that ultimately found no DNA or fingerprint proof linking him to the crime scene.\n\nDespite there being barely a scrap of evidence, Nick was the only person to be investigated over the child's murder\n\nSo, why did police continue to pursue Hillary for the murder of Garrett, ignoring neighbours\u2019 reports that suggested a group of Garrett\u2019s peers could have been involved in the death?\n\nAnother extraordinary twist in this gripping true story could help to explain it.\n\nConsidered in the new documentary is Hillary\u2019s historic love triangle with Tandy and her ex-partner John Jones, the Sheriff's Deputy, who just so happened to be assisting the investigation of Garrett\u2019s death.\n\nPerhaps a personal vendetta against Hillary could explain the full force of Potsdam\u2019s investigation? And, chillingly, does Jones know more about the crime that he has let on?\n\nIt\u2019s not until May 2014, almost three years after Garrett\u2019s death, that Hillary is officially indicted for second-degree murder, a charge carrying the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.\n\nWas Nick's conviction down to the allegedly racist legal system - or could it be down to the fact he was in a love triangle with Tandy and her ex, John Jones - the Sheriff's Deputy\n\nIn a dramatic twist of fate, it\u2019s his own subsequent defamation suit against the village of Potsdam that backfires, linking him to the murder victim on the night of the crime.\n\nA series of unbelievable events continue to turn Hillary\u2019s life upside down until the fateful trial two years later in September 2016, which is closely examined in Who Killed Garrett Phillips?\n\nTo prosecute Hillary, the state of New York must present enough evidence to link him to the crime scene.\n\nHowever, can the defence prove that Hillary is the true victim of a village-wide witch hunt that began the day Garrett was found dead?\n\nDecide for yourself as you get the ask the questions during Sky Crime's run of unmissable documentary Who Killed Garrett Phillips? on Sky Crime from 20 October\n\nBrand new channel, Sky Crime, the new home of true crime, is now available.
