The market has long awaited the Aurora Cannabis (ACB) report to see the progress made by the leading Canadian cannabis company. The promise of reaching positive financial targets makes the quarter a potential inflection point.\n\nFQ4 Targets\n\nAurora Cannabis has already released preliminary FQ4 results so the actual key metrics aren\u2019t the key focus here. For the June quarter, the company provided these preliminary numbers:\n\nRevenue \u2013 C$100 to C$107 million\n\nEBTIDA \u2013 tracking toward positive EBITDA\n\nProduction \u2013 close to 30,000 kg\n\nThe biggest question is how close the company has come towards reaching adjusted EBITDA positive metrics. Maybe even more important is whether the metric is sustainable with industry production surging.\n\nIn order to reach adjusted EBITDA positive metrics, Aurora Cannabis needs to achieve gross margins of closer to 70% while Canopy Growth recently guided to goals for 40% gross margin targets.\n\nThe market will closely watch whether a premier Canadian cannabis company can hit a huge improvement over the 56% gross margins in FQ3 that led to an EBITDA loss of C$36.6 million. Any aggressive pricing from Canopy Growth could impact the targets of Aurora Cannabis.\n\nAt the same time, quarterly operating expenses in the C$70 million range need to be relatively stable over the quarter to achieve the EBITDA breakeven goals. The industry hasn\u2019t been great at restraining costs.\n\nOther Key Metrics\n\nWhile the market will focus big time on EBITDA positive targets, a lot of questions will center around cannabis production, inventory and sales levels. The company had originally targeted having 25,000 kg available for sale in the quarter and the company updated guidance of closer to 30,000 kg. Production 20% above targets has huge ramifications for flooding the market with supply.\n\nThe revenue target suggests sales of only slightly above 15,000 kg, up from 9,160 kg in the March quarter. The sales growth is impressive, but the end result is 50% of production still left in inventory.\n\nAnother key metric is the sales price per gram. In the prior quarter, the sales price dipped to C$6.40 per gram as more sales shifted to recreational cannabis sales away from medical sales. The price dipped about C$0.40 from the prior quarter and the targets suggest another similar dip to C$6.00 per gram.\n\nNaturally, guidance will matter as much as the current financial metrics. Analysts are projecting revenues top C$120 million in the September quarter and up to C$140 million in the December quarter.\n\nWhere the company projects EBITDA in the face of ramping costs for Cannabis 2.0 and substantial capacity growth ahead could damage the stock. The market doesn\u2019t need ultimate profitability, but a clear path to maintaining positive EBTIDA with the quarterly revenue totals now topping C$100 million is a must.\n\nConsensus Verdict\n\nACB has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street. This breaks down into 3 'buy' and 4 'hold' ratings in the last three months. We can also see from TipRanks that the average analyst price target is $9.08 - 43% upside from the current share price.\n\nStory continues", "description": "One of the most high-profile cannabis companies finally reports official June quarter results after the close today.
