(Giphy)\n\nHello! You're reading the CBC Arts newsletter, and if you like what you see, stick around! Sign up here, and every Sunday we'll send you a fresh email packed with art, culture and a metric truckload of eye candy, hand-picked by our small and mighty team. Here's what we've been talking about this week.\n\nHi, art lovers!\n\nI might as well be honest with you. I actually write these newsletters on Friday, and to make that teensy confession overwhelmingly obvious, I just finished watching the new Missy Elliott video and started streaming her first record in 14 (!!!) years \u2014 and both experiences have already fundamentally clouded my ability to curate the next four links.\n\n\n\nStop sulking that you missed out on Museum of Missy Elliott tix this weekend, 'cause I'm rolling right into the eye candy.\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf, nwod enohp ruoy tup!\n\n(Instagram/@laetitiaky)\n\nSo I have definitely featured this Instagram star before, but the cover Missy's Iconology EP has got to share some DNA with the \"braid art\" of Laetitia KY. So fierce.\n\n(Instagram/@kateballis)\n\nLoving all those pink skies and fuchsia front yards in the \"Throw It Back\" video, too? Soak in some similarly dreamy infrared photography by Kate Ballis \u2026\n\n(Instagram/@paolopettigiani)\n\nPaolo Pettigiani ...\n\nMike Andrew McLean. The Empty House at the Bottom of the Hill.

(\"Throw it back\" to this CBC Arts story from the archives.)\n\nYou've got to see this\n\nOh, they love trash - Around Canada, a bunch of residency programs are dropping artists at the dump. Are people really that desperate for studio space? That's not what led these folks to sign up. Find out what happens when you let artists loose in a landfill.\n\nYou won't find these in a thrift shop - Marc Adornato hacks old paintings, turning kitschy landscapes into toxic disasters. Real Canadian toxic disasters. We met him in Ottawa.\n\nAn artist's guide to Yellowknife - Maybe it's too late for a last-minute summer vacation in the Northwest Territories, but that's cool. This travel guide from local artist Charlotte Overvold is packed with all-season tips.\n\nFollow this artist\n\n(Instagram/@rumalow)\n\nAlison Postma (@rumalow) - Beautiful garbage. Alison's doing the Reclaim Artist Residency this summer, one of the programs that gets a mention in that story I linked to earlier. That pretty-pretty still life? It's made with junk she scavenged from a cottage country landfill.\n\nGot questions? Typo catches? Story ideas?\n\n\n\nWe're just an email away. Send us a note, and we'll do our best to get back to you.\n\n\n\nAnd if someone forwarded you this message and you like what you've read, here's where to subscribe for more.\n\n\n\nUntil next week!\n\nXOXO, CBC Arts", "description": "In this week's edition: lots of infrared photography ... because of the 'Throw it Back' video.", "authors": ["Cbc Arts"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5259966.1566832696!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/missy-elliott-throw-it-back.jpg"}
