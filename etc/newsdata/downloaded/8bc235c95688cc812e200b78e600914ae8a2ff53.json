Authorities suggest you kill them on sight.", "language": "en", "text": "The department is now trying to figure out if the fish has spread from the pond as it looks to prevent the species from reaching other bodies of water in Georgia, Matt Thomas, chief of fisheries for the Wildlife Resources Division, said in a statement.\n\nThe long, thin fish that looks similar to a bowfin can be harmful to wildlife because it can out-compete, or later displace, other species in the water, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Should the species succeed in establishing more populations of predatory offspring, it could alter food webs and ecological systems that could leave a permanent change to other species in water bodies, according to U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe northern snakehead fish, a native to East Asia, used to be sold in pet stores, live-food fish markets and restaurants in some major cities before 2002, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added the species to its list of injurious wildlife.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe sharp-tooth fish was first spotted in the wild in the United States in San Bernardino County\u2019s Silverwood Lake in California in 1997, according to NISIC\u2019s database. Northern snakeheads have been reported in 14 other states, according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources\u2019 Wildlife Resources Division.\n\nInvasive fish like the northern snakehead are often introduced through unauthorized release, according to Georgia wildlife authorities. In Georgia, it\u2019s illegal to import, transport, sell, transfer and have any species of snakehead without a valid wildlife license.\n\nMaryland had the first established population of the fish in 2002, and the state has the largest distribution of northern snakeheads, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. The fish can now be found in every major tidal river of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe air-breathing fish are able to draw breath through an air bladder that\u2019s similar to a lung, according to the Chesapeake Bay Program. Their breathing ability makes it possible for them to navigate to other small areas of land and new bodies of water. The fish can survive up to four days out of water if it\u2019s kept moist, and it can remain immobile, but alive, in mud during drought, according to the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n\nThe fish can grow up to three feet and can weigh up to 18 pounds or more.\n\nThe splotchy-looking fish eats other fish, and it has been reported that it will also eat amphibians, crawfish and even small animals such as mice, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\n\nAD\n\nWildlife officials in Georgia are asking anglers to learn how to identify, kill and photograph the fish and reporting their catch to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources\u2019 Wildlife Resources Division Fisheries office.\n\nThe fish could also make a nutrient-packed meal, according to research.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A northern snakehead fish, a highly invasive species, was caught earlier this month in a Georgia pond.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mNTrZrxW2isKsDDeLfjtM_NOSvk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6LBHBPHLRQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
