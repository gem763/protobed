You just said two minutes ago they would have to buy in,\u201d Castro jabbed at Biden, who at the age of 78 on Inauguration Day 2021 would be the oldest president ever to serve should he win. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Andrew Yang talk Thursday, Sept. 12, 2019, after a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip) More\n\nCastro, 44, insisted after the debate that he wasn\u2019t taking a shot at Biden\u2019s age. But by the tenor of the shot he might as well have asked the former vice president for recommendations for early-bird specials. Many political analysts viewed it as a low blow. And it also appeared Castro misrepresented the former vice president's stance.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it differently. That was not a personal attack,\" Castro said in his defense Friday morning on CNN. \"This was about a disagreement over what the vice president said regarding health care policy.\"\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that Biden\u2019s age has been an issue from the moment he pondered entering the 2020 presidential race.\n\nBut until Thursday night debate in Houston, the issue had been dealt with a healthy dose of politeness from his rival Democrats. They might see that while the electorate may be getting younger, the most reliable voters often have at least a tinge of silver in their hair. In the 2016 presidential election, for example, 71% of Americans over 65 voted, compared with 46% among 18- to 29-year-olds, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, 38, of California, who exited the presidential race in July, was far more subtle than Castro in raising the age issue at the first Democratic debate. He recalled how as a young politician Biden had paraphrased John F. Kennedy and nudged an older generation of Democrats to \u201cpass the torch.\u201d\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has waxed about the need for generational change in leadership at a moment when the world needs to confront the existential crisis of climate change.\n\nThe 70s candiates: Trump vs. Biden in Iowa: Septuagenarian rivals try to demonstrate vigor in head-to-head stops\n\nAnalysis: The Democratic race gets hotter with a debate over where, exactly, the party should stand\n\nBut with Castro\u2019s shot at Biden early in the debate, Democratic strategists, friends of both Biden and Castro from their shared time in the Obama administration, and political analysts cringed.\n\n\u201cThat was not my favorite version of Castro,\u201d Jen Psaki, a former State Department spokeswoman and longtime aide to President Barack Obama, tweeted.\n\nThat was not my favorite version of Castro. \u2014 Jen Psaki (@jrpsaki) September 13, 2019\n\nPaul Begala, a former senior aide to President Bill Clinton turned CNN political pundit, gave points to Biden for not giving the attack oxygen.\n\n\u201c.@JulianCastro with a cheap shot on @JoeBiden,\u201d Begala said. \u201cJoe fights back, then pulls up, knowing better than to punch down.
