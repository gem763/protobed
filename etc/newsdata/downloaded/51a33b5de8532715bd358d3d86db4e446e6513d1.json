But then this happens \u2026\n\nI\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for five months and I\u2019m absolutely crazy about her. She lives abroad, so when we see each other we want to make it special. Everything about our sex life is amazing, until it comes to intercourse, when I can\u2019t maintain an erection. It\u2019s really getting me down and, to be honest, I don\u2019t feel like a man. I think to myself: \u201cWhat if she thinks it\u2019s her?\u201d and I tell her it\u2019s not, but I just don\u2019t know what it is. I find her so sexually attractive and I just want to show her how much \u2013 but when this happens, I\u2019m just so embarrassed. Any help would be massively appreciated.\n\nLong-distance relationships can be maintained well, but there are frequently accompanying anxieties and pressures. It is understandable that you would consider every moment you have together as special and important, but this creates enormous performance anxiety for you, which can negatively affect any man\u2019s erectile capacity. Help her to understand this fact, and decide together to try to have very relaxed, easy sex that is simply pleasure-focused rather than goal-oriented. Stop expecting fabulous sex the moment you see each other, and instead plan some non-sexual fun such as dinner or an outing to give yourselves time to warm up. When you feel fully relaxed, approach lovemaking without any expectations. If you set out to please and arouse her in non-penetrative ways \u2013 and seek her feedback regarding this \u2013 you will take the pressure off your wish for erections \u201con demand\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.\n\n\u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).
