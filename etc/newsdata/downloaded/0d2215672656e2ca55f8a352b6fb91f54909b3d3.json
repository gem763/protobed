As Farrow recounts, Weinstein arrayed not just some big legal guns to thwart him and other reporters, but a host of black-ops characters: former Mossad agents, Ukrainian surveillance pros, European undercover operatives. Their mission was to monitor Farrow and other journalists who were closing in on Weinstein. One of Weinstein\u2019s sub rosa retainers was an Israeli intelligence company called \u2014 no joke, Mr. Bond \u2014 Black Cube.\n\nAD\n\nFarrow pierced this legal and quasi-espionage veil to land a devastating story about Weinstein, published by the New Yorker exactly two years ago Thursday. The story, which followed by five days a separate series of revelations about Weinstein in the New York Times, earned Farrow and Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey the Pulitzer Prize. More important, their expos\u00e9s touched off a cultural avalanche. Within weeks, other powerful men saw their walls of privilege and protection come tumbling down amid the march of the #MeToo movement.\n\n(Weinstein, who eventually was charged with sex crimes, including rape, faces trial in New York in January. He has pleaded not guilty.)\n\nAD\n\nIn the wake of his landmark Weinstein story, Farrow, 31, went on to expose other powerful men and institutions, becoming the go-to journalist of the movement and the moment.\n\nAD\n\nThe immediate follow-up to his Weinstein reporting was his disclosure of the \u201ccatch and kill\u201d tactics employed by American Media Inc., parent of the National Enquirer, to suppress stories it sometimes later used to blackmail celebrities (the phrase refers to paying sources for exclusive rights to their information and then withholding, or killing, the story). Among the beneficiaries of the tactic: President Trump. Former Playboy model Karen McDougal had told the Enquirer about her alleged affair with Trump, but her story was caught and killed by AMI during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAD\n\nFarrow, of course, is no ordinary reporter. Aside from his background as an intellectual prodigy, his mother is actress Mia Farrow and his father is Woody Allen, although both his parents have suggested at times that his real father is Frank Sinatra (to which Ronan Farrow quips: \u201cWe\u2019re all possibly Frank Sinatra\u2019s son. I\u2019ll leave it at that\u201d). His family issues have been tabloid fodder ever since Farrow\u2019s sister, Dylan, accused Allen of molesting her when she was 7 in 1992.\n\nAD\n\nAllen, who has denied the allegation and was never charged with a crime, later married their sister, Soon-Yi Previn, making the director both Ronan\u2019s father and his brother-in-law. He is long estranged from Mia Farrow and the Farrow siblings.\n\nDylan Farrow is both the muse and moral center of \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d as Farrow, as an investigative reporter for NBC News in early 2017, sets about investigating vague allegations against Weinstein. She appears repeatedly throughout his narrative to spur him on as his reporting runs into obstructive forces, including, he writes, his bosses at NBC News. (In his desperation to shake Farrow, Weinstein at one point tried to lean on Woody Allen to persuade Farrow to back off; his representatives later argued that Farrow\u2019s family history was a disqualifying conflict of interest).\n\nAD\n\nDylan Farrow\u2019s experience, and Allen\u2019s long-running efforts to suppress and undermine her account, were a kind of foreground story for the book, Farrow says. But he adds, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a story in which I\u2019m the hero of her narrative.\u201d Long before the #MeToo era, he confesses, he\u2019d sometimes ask his sister to \u201cshut up\u201d about her accusations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI felt I had to be nakedly honest and vulnerable about that\u201d in writing his account, he says. In tribute to his sister, Farrow included some of her illustrations in the book.\n\nBefitting a Farrow story, \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d is chocka\u00adblock with scoops and revelations. The most headline-grabbing is an allegation by a \u201cToday\u201d show producer, Brooke Nevils, that she was raped by Matt Lauer, the program\u2019s co-host, when they were covering the Winter Olympics in 2014. Lauer \u2014 who was fired shortly after Nevils went to NBC\u2019s management in late 2017 \u2014 vehemently denied Nevils\u2019s account in a lengthy statement on Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nMuch of Farrow\u2019s book seeks to answer a question that hovered in the background of his celebrated New Yorker article about Weinstein: Why did the story wind up in the New Yorker when Farrow spent months investigating him for NBC News?\n\nAD\n\nIn Farrow\u2019s telling, Lauer is the key to that question. His thesis is that Weinstein pressured NBC News and its executives by using AMI\u2019s accumulated dirt on Lauer to slow down and eventually stop Farrow\u2019s reporting on Weinstein. Farrow writes that NBC covered up multiple allegations against Lauer stretching back years by paying his accusers and ensuring their silence through nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). He also writes about several instances of workplace misconduct by NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack, and MSNBC\u2019s president, Phil Griffin, making them vulnerable to exposure by Weinstein. (NBC declined to comment on Lack or Griffin.)\n\nIt was, Farrow says, \u201ca corporate coverup.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFarrow writes that NBC even had a corporate euphemism for its settlements \u2014 \u201cenhanced severance\u201d \u2014 that enabled it to plausibly deny that the payments were hush money.\n\nAD\n\nNeedless to say, this has touched off a battle royal with NBC. The network has vigorously disputed Farrow\u2019s premise and his reporting about it. Lack said on Wednesday that NBC was unaware of any issues involving Lauer until Nevils stepped forward, reiterating NBC\u2019s statement on the matter since the story first exploded.\n\nFurther, an executive familiar with the network\u2019s legal affairs said in an interview with The Washington Post that Lauer was the subject of four employee complaints \u2014 but three of them came in after he was fired following Nevils\u2019s allegations. Contrary to Farrow\u2019s claims, \u201cthere is no evidence of a pattern\u201d of earlier claims, said the executive, who spoke with NBC\u2019s approval but would not be identified.\n\nIn the days leading up to the book\u2019s publication next Tuesday, the network has launched a furious public relations counterattack against Farrow. NBC News President Noah Oppenheim has visited seven news organizations, including The Post, to present an elaborate rebuttal, complete with binders containing timelines, interview transcripts, expense logs and contemporaneous text messages and emails to and from Farrow and his editors documenting his progress on the Weinstein story.\n\nThe short version of Oppenheim's presentation is that Farrow's reporting wasn't ready, that he didn't have any of Weinstein's accusers on the record at the time he walked away in frustration in August 2017. \"There was a wide circle of people [at NBC News], and there was unanimity at the time and there is now, that we made the only decision we could that [Farrow's reporting] hadn't met our standards for air,\" Oppenheim said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Farrow and his producer at the time, Rich McHugh, say they had several women on the record at the time, and commitments from others to follow suit. They also had a damning audio recording of a police sting in which Weinstein admits to assault.\n\nNBC\u2019s \u201cactions were a massive breach of journalistic integrity,\u201d said McHugh, who left NBC in 2018. \u201cThey can do all the verbal gymnastics they want, but at the end of the day, they ordered us to stop reporting.\u201d\n\nFarrow\u2019s editor at the New Yorker, David Remnick, also said the reporting was well advanced, though not yet ready for publication, when Farrow initially walked into the magazine. It was published within seven weeks.\n\nAD\n\nInterestingly, NBC doesn\u2019t dispute one of Farrow\u2019s scoops, a minor one but telling nonetheless. In the wake of the Weinstein imbroglio, he writes, the network hired a \u201cWikipedia whitewasher\u201d to scrub references to the episode from some of its pages, a curious decision for a news organization dedicated to transparency. To this day, there\u2019s no reference to the Weinstein affair under Noah Oppenheim\u2019s Wikipedia entry, and only a fleeting one in Andy Lack\u2019s.\n\nAD\n\nWhatever the merits of NBC\u2019s full-court press against \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d the network\u2019s campaign seems more likely to boost the book\u2019s sales than to diminish it, and to raise the author\u2019s already ascendant \u2014 some would say amazing \u2014 profile.\n\nThe short version of Farrow\u2019s prodigious r\u00e9sum\u00e9:\n\nHe started college at the age of 11, and graduated at 15, whereupon he was immediately accepted into Yale Law School. He delayed entry at Yale to work as a speechwriter for Richard Holbrooke, the famed diplomat. He also became a spokesman for UNICEF in Sudan, Angola and Nigeria.\n\nWhile still a teenager, he began publishing op-ed columns in the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and other newspapers. His commentaries focused on issues involving Africa, such as the war-torn Darfur region of Sudan.\n\nAfter finishing Yale Law at 21, he spent two years at the State Department during the Obama administration, running U.S. relations with nongovernmental organizations in Pakistan and Afghanistan. He also served as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s adviser for youth issues.\n\nAt 24, he completed a Rhodes scholarship at Oxford University.\n\nNBC signed him to a contract at 25, handing him his own daytime MSNBC program, \u201cRonan Farrow Daily.\u201d The show lasted a year before being canceled due to low ratings, but the network kept Farrow on as an investigative correspondent.\n\nSoon enough, in one of the many overlapping elements and crisscrossing personalities that show up in \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d Matt Lauer was introducing Farrow\u2019s reports on the \u201cToday\u201d show.\n\nAlong the way, Farrow wrote a best-selling book about the history of American diplomacy, \u201cWar on Peace,\u201d published last year.\n\nEarlier this year, he earned a PhD in international relations from Oxford. The subtitle of his 89,000-word thesis: \u201cPolitical Representation and Strategic Reality in America\u2019s Proxy Wars.\u201d Farrow describes it as an examination of America\u2019s collaborations with foreign militaries and militias.\n\nAside from Farrow\u2019s formidable intellectual heft, Remnick, the New Yorker\u2019s editor, said he saw something else in the young journalist during his reporting of the Weinstein story: empathy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of investigative reporters, but I\u2019ve never seen a situation where so much empathy was required,\u201d Remnick says. \u201cI saw his doggedness and the endless hours he put in, but I also had the opportunity to see him [interact] with the women who were treated so horribly by Weinstein, and it was quite something. There was sincerity. There was patience. It was empathy.\u201d\n\nRemnick doesn\u2019t know whether Farrow was ever in real danger during this period (\u201cI think the surveillance stuff was mostly designed to intimidate and scare him. I don\u2019t think he was about to get a Luger in the back\u201d), but he also said he never saw Farrow sweat under the pressure. \u201cHe was very, very cool,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the cinematic elements of \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d make it likely bait for a movie or TV adaptation, Farrow says he hasn\u2019t actively considered offers for the book, though there\u2019s been interest in it since it was first announced last year. (Farrow himself is developing a series of documentaries for HBO about \u201cthe abuse of power by individuals and institutions\u201d).", "description": "The investigative journalist\u2019s new book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d is producing explosive headlines.", "authors": ["Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OMK81WET_UBFQXdSe5LaC3hqEc8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UUQNBAHK4AI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
