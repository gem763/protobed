The rest of us are always asking those guys for hints.\n\n\"It's hard to explain the benefits in concrete terms,\" added Sakate. \"But it helps us keep calm and to communicate clearly and solve problems that arise during matches.\"\n\nJapan famously stunned South Africa 34-32 in their opening fixture of the 2015 World Cup under Eddie Jones, who introduced mental coaches to the Brave Blossoms set-up.\n\nThe Springboks crushed the Japanese 41-7 in a World Cup warm-up last month and will go into Sunday's quarter-final in Tokyo as favourites to end the host side's fairytale run.\n\nBut Tongan-born lock Uwe Helu warned that Japan were a different beast now after sweeping to top spot in Pool A and achieving their target of a place in knockout stages.\n\n\"We already reached our goal - no one expected us to make the top eight,\" he shrugged.\n\n\"No one will look at us to beat South Africa either, but we'll have a few tricks this weekend - it's another chance to prove people wrong.\"\n\nUtility back Ryohei Yamanaka, whose 2011 World Cup dreams were dashed after he was banned for using a hair-growth cream to try to grow a moustache which contained an illegal substance, insisted Japan could spring another shock.\n\n\"Obviously we have no experience of being in a World Cup quarter-final,\" he said.\n\n\"But we're ready to go. We have nothing to lose, we just have to go out and give everything we have.\"", "description": "World Cup hosts Japan are using daily brain teasers to get their neurons firing as they plot their quarter-final clash against the All Blacks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2819/a76cd3a070b942679c66263b75ea56fe.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
