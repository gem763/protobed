It feels condensed because it has been condensed. This is a notable difference from ground beef that often comes in long strands, directly from the grinder.\n\nMy initial impressions of Impossible Foods' meat were not positive.\n\nWhen I took it out of the package, it reminded me more of opening a can of dog food (which I, unfortunately, do every day) than opening a butcher's package full of ground beef. There was a surprisingly strong scent, which ground beef usually doesn't have, and a general sliminess to the product. That latter bit was especially bad, because slimy ground beef is usually a good indication that it's gone bad.\n\nAbout 25 seconds later, after I had more closely sniffed and actually tasted the veggie \"beef,\" things improved considerably. It quickly leapt from alien object to something more familiar: a kind of beef-like ingredient that my brain accepted as real enough.", "description": "Impossible Foods is finally selling its veggie beef in supermarkets, and I'm putting it through the paces.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9281a22e22af54eb1fd46e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
