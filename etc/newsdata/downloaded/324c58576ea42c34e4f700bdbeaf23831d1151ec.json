If SUV drivers were a nation, they would rank seventh in the world for carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cAn SUV is bigger, it\u2019s heavier, the aerodynamics are poor, so as a result you get more CO2,\u201d said Florent Grelier from the campaign group Transport & Environment.\n\nT&E figures show the average mass of new cars rose 10% between 2000 and 2016, which the group suggested could be down to a trend towards SUVs, heavier automatic and dual-clutch gearboxes and the inclusion of other equipment including cameras and sensors.\n\nGrelier said the global shift towards bigger cars had been observed for a while, but the effect on emissions increases compared to other industries was surprising nonetheless.\n\n\u201cThe problem is much bigger than we expected,\u201d he said.\n\nSUV sales are growing despite overall stagnation in the car market Global passenger car sales Source: IEA\n\nThe global car market has been stalling in recent years, which analysts have attributed to the escalating China\u2013US trade war and the sluggish performance of the Chinese economy in general.\n\nThe SUV segment has so far bucked this trend however, with a record 35m vehicles sold in 2018.\n\nThe IEA figures show that SUVs steadily increased their share across major markets all around the world, from Europe and the US to China and India.\n\nCozzi said this was another surprise: \u201cWe thought this was a trend that was more concentrated in a few countries \u2026 but it\u2019s becoming really universal.\u201d\n\nIn the US, nearly one in two passenger cars sold today is an SUV.\n\n\n\nThe IEA\u2019s definition of \u201cSUV\u201d covers a range of cars from crossovers to off-road vehicles. Popular models in the UK include the Nissan Qashqai, Hyundai Tucson and Land Rover Range Rover.\n\nThe emissions analysis considered only the carbon produced from fuel combustion, not any emissions embedded in the manufacturing of the cars \u2013 where larger models are also likely to result in more emissions.\n\nSUVs started to become popular in the 1980s, and often earned nicknames such as \u201cChelsea Tractor\u201d as a result of the wealthy city suburbs they became associated with. Since then, sales have continued to rise, and the vehicles are often marketed as a status symbol.\n\nHowever, opposition to SUVs in cities is also rising. Berlin recently saw protests demanding a ban on the vehicles after a driver hit and killed four pedestrians, while in Frankfurt activists protested against the climate impact of the vehicles at a trade show. SUVs are significantly more likely to kill pedestrians in crashes, and although they are often marketed as safer, people driving them are 11% more likely to die in a crash than people in normal cars.\n\nCozzi said a number of factors were driving demand for bigger cars. While perceptions of heightened safety or increased social status could play a role at the individual level, she also pointed towards manufacturers\u2019 changing offering.\n\nShe said the difficult market situation led carmakers to look for the most profitable models in their ranges.\n\n\u201cThere is a really big need for car manufacturers to find the margins wherever it is possible, and the SUV segment seems to be one of those places,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the UK, the transport sector overtook energy generation as the number one source of greenhouse gas emissions in 2016.\n\nAccording to Guardian analysis of DfT statistics, there are about five million licensed SUVs in the UK today.\n\nThe UK government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040, although hybrid models would be exempt under the plan.\n\nThe Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s independent adviser, says the ban should be brought forward to 2035 and include hybrid cars.\n\nEU-wide, electric vehicles made up only 2% of new cars sold last year, but a recent report from Transport & Environment suggests that figure could reach 10% by 2021.\n\nThis is due in part to EU emissions targets, phased in from next year, which will put much stricter limits on the average emissions of each manufacturer\u2019s newly registered cars.\n\nExperts are stressing that quick decarbonisation of the transport sector will also require a reduction in the total number of passenger cars on the road, particularly in big cities.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep less and less space for cars so that it\u2019s more convenient for people to use other means of transportation, whether it\u2019s walking, cycling or public transport,\u201d Grelier said.", "description": "If SUV drivers were a nation, they would rank seventh in the world for carbon emissions", "authors": ["Niko Kommenda"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18957d852a692d370d7c948b3afcfab0dc618245/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b14d34620111e6ed78fb2916ec692d66", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
