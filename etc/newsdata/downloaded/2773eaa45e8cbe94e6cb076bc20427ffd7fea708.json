Earlier this month, a royal source said, \"They hope to include Archie at some point in the program. It\u2019s just difficult to schedule because he\u2019s five months old.\u201d It is unclear if he will make another appearance during the official visit.\n\nFounded in Cape Town in 2013, the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation contributes to the development of youth and leadership, facilitates discussions about social justice and common human purposes and makes the lessons of Archbishop Tutu accessible to new generations.\n\nIt is located in one of Cape Town\u2019s oldest buildings and a national landmark, The Old Granary Building.\n\nHarry previously met with Archbishop Tutu in November 2015, when His Royal Highness presented him with the Insignia of an Honorary member of The Order of the Companions of Honour on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, in recognition of his services to U.K. communities and International Peace and Reconciliation.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "This is the first time the youngster has made an appearance on the royal tour.", "authors": ["Victoria Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jE55okv8tCLcbljmGmzFCA--~B/aD01NjU7dz0xMTI1O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/d7c87c9abc0f92da9816a3285617c00a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
