Although at least 25 homes were destroyed, fire officials said their crews managed to save thousands of dwellings while carving containment lines around 13 percent of the fire\u2019s perimeter.\n\nU.S. Representative Brad Sherman told Reuters he was among residents who fled as flames approached.\n\n\u201cI left a bit earlier than most because I was watching the news, and the moment they posted on the internet that I was in the mandatory evacuation area, I was out,\u201d Sherman said by mobile phone as he walked back to check on his home in the Porter Ranch suburb.\n\nThe conflagration was stoked by strong, dry Santa Ana winds blowing into Los Angeles from desert areas to the east. Those winds were moving flames at a rate of 800 acres per hour at the fire\u2019s height, city fire officials said at a morning news conference.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dynamic fire,\u201d Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas told reporters, urging residents in harm\u2019s way to heed evacuation orders. \u201cDo not wait to leave.\u201d\n\nThe cause of the blaze was under investigation.\n\n\u2018DON\u2019T BE FOOLED\u2019\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Deputy Dave Richardson cautioned that an apparent lull in fire activity on Friday afternoon should not create a false sense of security.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for additional growth of this fire.\u201d\n\nSome 23,000 homes and around 100,000 residents were under mandatory evacuation orders from the Saddleridge fire, and three emergency shelters quickly filled to capacity. Many evacuees were left to wonder whether their homes were still standing.\n\nPorter Ranch was one of the communities under mandatory evacuation orders [L3N26W3ZR]. The upscale suburb lies adjacent to a natural gas storage field where a wellhead rupture caused a massive methane leak in 2015 that forced nearby residents from their homes on and off for months.\n\nThe blaze also was \u201cthreatening a number of\u201d transmission lines owned by Southern California Edison, a utility spokeswoman, Susan Cox, said.\n\nFirefighters battle a wind-driven wildfire in Sylmar, California, U.S., October 11, 2019. REUTERS/ Gene Blevins\n\nSeveral freeways were closed at the outset of the blaze.\n\nThick clouds of smoke billowing from the blaze drifted across a wide swath of northern Los Angeles, causing air quality problems that prompted the city school district to close dozens of public schools throughout the San Fernando Valley.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Captain Tony Imbrenda told local radio station KPCC that high winds had hampered the ability to fight the flames from the air, sometimes causing dissipation of water and fire-retardant drops before they could hit the ground.\n\nSimilarly strong winds in northern California prompted utility giant Pacific Gas & Electric to impose a precautionary shutoff of power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses to reduce the risk of wildfires over the past few days.\n\nSANDALWOOD FIRE\n\nAuthorities also fought to gain an upper hand on the Sandalwood Fire in Riverside County, about 70 miles east of the Saddleridge fire, which had scorched about 830 acres and destroyed 76 homes and other structures by Friday around the town of Calimesa.\n\nOne fatality was reported, along with two people who were unaccounted for. The blaze was just 10% contained, Riverside County Fire Department (RCFD) officials said.\n\nThe Sandalwood fire erupted on Thursday afternoon when a garbage truck dumped burning trash that spread onto vegetation, the RCFD and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said in a statement.\n\nMuch of Northern California, from San Francisco to the Oregon border, remained under a statewide \u201cred flag\u201d fire alert for heightened fire danger on Friday.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nBy late Thursday, PG&E announced it had restored power to more than half of its customers whose power was turned off, and that 312,000 remained without electricity.\n\nAs winds moved south Friday, a power shutdown similar to PG&E\u2019s was underway at Southern California Edison, which cut electricity to more than 20,000 customers and warned that 110,000 more could face outages later.", "description": "A fierce, wind-driven wildfire swept through foothills and canyons along the northern edge of Los Angeles on Friday, engulfing homes, closing roads and devouring acre upon acre of dry brush and chaparral as 100,000 residents were forced to flee.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439864130&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0Z8", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
