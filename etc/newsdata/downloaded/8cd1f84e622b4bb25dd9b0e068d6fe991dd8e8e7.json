Beck has been both an editor and writer at The Atlantic since 2013; most recently, she has been a senior editor for The Atlantic\u2019s coverage of family and education since 2018.\n\nGoldberg and LaFrance wrote: \u201cJulie is deeply creative and funny, and has both a strong magazine sensibility and an intuitive understanding of the best sorts of internet weirdness. We can\u2019t wait to see all that she accomplishes in this new role.\u201d\n\nAmong the projects Beck has led is \u201cThe Friendship Files,\u201d a series of interviews with sets of friends around the world exploring the intimate and indelible nature of friendships. Before joining the Family section, Beck covered science, technology, and health.\n\nThe Atlantic introduced its Family section in March 2018, signaling a renewed commitment to covering the modern issues affecting families today. Reporting and features have explored topics like how Tinder changed online dating, the shifting norms of marriage and sizes of family homes, along with in-depth investigations on how domestic abusers weaponize courts against survivors, and Catholic parents at a crossroads on how to respond to the church\u2019s ongoing sexual abuse crisis.\n\n###", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/JulieBeck/facebook.jpg?1571241052", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
