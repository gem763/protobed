Chip prices started falling in the fourth quarter of last year.This year\u2019s July-September figures are in line with projections by analysts. The average projection for Samsung\u2019s third quarter sales was 61.5 trillion won and 7.2 trillion won for operating profit.Samsung didn\u2019t break down performances by divisions, but the conglomerate\u2019s IT & mobile and display divisions are believed to have driven the growth, with the semiconductor division responsible for the declines.According to a projection from NH Investment & Securities, Samsung was expected to have posted 2.5 trillion won in operating profit from its IT & mobile division, a 62 percent surge from the previous quarter, and 1 trillion won from the display division, a 35 percent jump from the second quarter.Operating profit from the semiconductor division was estimated at 3.3 trillion won, a three percent decline from the previous quarter.Similarly, Meritz Securities expected Samsung to have earned 2.5 trillion won in operating profit from the IT & mobile division, 1.2 trillion won from the display division (up 50 percent from the previous quarter) and 3.3 trillion won from the semiconductor division.\u201cSales of the Galaxy Note10 and Galaxy A series are expected to have seen a boost following the rise in demand for the 5G network,\u201d NH wrote in a report released Tuesday. \u201cSteady sales of its own smartphones and those of its clients are seen to have helped its display division.\u201dSamsung unveiled its premium Galaxy Note10 in August. The conglomerate is also seen to have benefitted from the U.S. restrictions on Chinese rival Huawei Technologies that cut off access to Google\u2019s Android services like the Google Play Store and Google apps for its mobile phones.Samsung will likely see a 2 percent drop in operating profit in the fourth quarter to some 7.5 trillion won compared to the third quarter as DRAM prices continue to fall due to increased supply, according to the report from NH.Meritz said the prices of NAND chips will stabilize in the fourth quarter with some of the products seeing an increase, but the increases will be limited to 10 percent.Samsung Electronics\u2019 shares on Tuesday inched up 2.41 percent to close at 48,900 won.BY JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
