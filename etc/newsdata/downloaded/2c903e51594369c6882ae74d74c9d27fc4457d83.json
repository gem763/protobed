The moves will help trim the shortfall by as much as US$8 billion.\n\nGE\u2019s stubborn pension deficit, with added pressure from falling interest rates, has complicated Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp\u2019s efforts to put the Boston-based company on more stable ground. The CEO, who took the helm a year ago, has said debt remains one of the company\u2019s thorniest problems, alongside a slumping power business and lingering insurance liabilities.\n\nThe efforts to reduce debt are encouraging, though a pension freeze is likely to damage employee morale, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell said in a note. \u201cIn a situation of \u2018corporate battlefield surgery\u2019, this tends to be a typical, if unfortunate, casualty.\u201d\n\nThe pension changes, which will reduce GE\u2019s industrial net debt by as much as US$6 billion, follow similar moves by large companies including Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. as 401(k) retirement plans have gained favour. Meanwhile, companies such as FedEx Corp. have turned to offloading pension liabilities to insurers, including MetLife Inc.\n\nGE\u2019s US$22.4 billion in underfunded pension liabilities at the end of last year \u2014 including the main and supplemental plans \u2014 represented the largest shortfall of firms in the Russell 1000 Index of large U.S. companies, according to a Bloomberg review of the data.\n\nWhile GE\u2019s deficit has come down in recent years, the company faces a challenge from falling interest rates, which increase the funding gap by shrinking expected investment returns. Culp said last month at an industry conference that interest rates could create a US$7-billion headwind for the pension this year.\n\nThe shares fell less than 1 per cent to US$8.55 at 10:24 a.m. in New York. GE advanced 18 per cent this year through Friday, matching the S&P 500 Index.\n\nGE\u2019s bonds gained on Monday\u2019s news. The risk premium on the company\u2019s 3.373 per cent bonds due 2025 tightened nearly 8 basis points to 145.6 basis points, according to Trace bond price data. The cost to protect its debt against default for five years fell 9 basis points to 131.8 basis points, according to ICE Data Services.\n\nBeginning in 2021, about 20,000 employees in GE\u2019s main U.S. pension plan will stop accruing new benefits, under the plans GE unveiled Monday. About 700 employees in a supplementary plan will also be affected. At that time, GE will contribute 3 per cent of eligible compensation to a 401(k) plan and will provide matching contributions of 50 per cent on as much as 8 per cent of eligible compensation.\n\nThe company, which closed its pension plan to new entrants in 2012, said retirees already drawing pension benefits won\u2019t be affected. GE will offer a lump-sum payment to 100,000 eligible former employees who haven\u2019t started receiving their monthly pension payments.\n\n\u201cReturning GE to a position of strength has required us to make several difficult decisions, and today\u2019s decision to freeze the pension is no exception,\u201d GE\u2019s chief human resources officer, Kevin Cox, said in the statement. GE had 283,000 employees worldwide at the end of last year, including about 97,000 in the U.S.\n\nGE aims to reduce the net debt of its industrial businesses by US$25 billion, and Culp has said he wants to reduce GE\u2019s debt-to-earnings ratio to 2.5 times by the end of next year. The pension changes come several weeks after the company announced a US$5-billion debt tender.\n\nSince taking the helm in October 2018, Culp has been aggressive in his effort to fix the ailing company. He sold GE\u2019s biopharmaceutical business to Danaher Corp. for US$21.4 billion, divested a jet-leasing unit and unloaded part of GE\u2019s stake in Baker Hughes, easing investors\u2019 liquidity concerns.\n\nThe portfolio changes have helped bring in about US$38 billion in new cash, giving the company funds for the pension moves. GE said it expects to take a non-cash, pretax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings.\n\n\u2013With assistance from Frank Connelly, Molly Smith and Katherine Chiglinsky.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "GE plans to contribute as much as $5 billion to cover its estimated pension funding requirements through 2022", "authors": ["Richard Clough", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
