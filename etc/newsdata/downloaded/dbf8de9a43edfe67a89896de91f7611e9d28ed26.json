The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the earthquake had a magnitude at 6.8.\n\nDavao city Mayor Sara Duterte suspended school classes to allow authorities to inspect buildings for possible damage after the latest quake to hit the region in recent weeks.\n\nA 6.3 earthquake earlier this month in the same region killed five people and caused damage to several schools and other buildings.\n\nIn July, two earthquakes hours apart struck a group of sparsely populated islands in the Luzon Strait in the northern Philippines, killing eight people.\n\nSeismic activity is common in the Philippines, which lies on the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d the ring of faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world\u2019s earthquakes occur.\n\nA magnitude 7.7 quake killed nearly 2,000 people in the northern Philippines in 1990.", "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey says a 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck Tuesday morning on Mindanao island in the southern Philippines.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/29/USAT/51650ef2-ee55-4613-a19d-7b251ae2ef86-AP_Philippines_Earthquake.JPG?crop=1995,1497,x2,y0&width=1995&height=1496&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
