Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) describes a group of lung conditions that cause the airways to narrow and become inflamed. Examples include bronchitis, which affects the airways, and emphysema, which impacts the air sacs. This makes it harder to move air in and out as you breathe. Around 1.2million people in the UK are diagnosed with COPD, British Lung Foundation statistics show. And in the US, 16million people suffer from COPD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It usually develops due to long-term damage to the lungs from smoking or air pollution. Jobs where people are exposed to fumes, dust and chemicals also raise the risk. COPD also seems to run in families. And a rare genetic condition called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency makes people susceptible at a very young age. Symptoms include: Breathlessness during day-to-day activities, like walking\n\nPersistent cough\n\nWheezing in cold weather\n\nProducing excess phlegm In severe cases, sufferers lose their appetite, have swollen ankles, lose weight and may even cough up blood. COPD is incurable and the damage to the lungs cannot be reversed. However, treatments can help make breathing easier. Patients should also quit smoking and maintain a healthy weight.\n\nThese substances are corrosive, irritating the eyes, throat and lungs, as well as causing headaches.\n\nBut it's not just the immediate burning and headaches from using too much bleach or Windex - repeated exposures may do long-term harm.\n\nTo investigate how these chemicals might affect COPD risks, researchers at Harvard and the University of Versailles followed a group of well over 73,000 nurses, beginning in 1989 and following up with them via surveys every two years since.\n\nThey'd seen in previous studies that people who cleaned professionally had higher risks of both asthma and death from COPD.\n\nHeavy-duty, thorough cleaning is particularly important in heath care settings, meaning that nurses might be put in harm's way by doing their best to keep their patients safe.\n\nThe scientists tracked how much formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, bleach, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, ammonium and enzyme cleaning products the nurses were exposed to.\n\nThey found that those that were often exposed to those chemicals were between 25 percent and 36 percent more at-risk of developing COPD.\n\nAs a result, an estimated 40 to 70 percent of them would not survive longer than five years after diagnosis, depending on how severe their disease was.\n\nThe study authors suggest that the cleaning products may damage the lung lining and cause oxidative stress, a kind of cellular damage that can cause inflammation.\n\nInterestingly, enzymatic cleaners - which contain 'good' bacteria and are primarily used to clean fat and oil and to eliminate odors such as those from urine - don't seem to have the same irritant effects or raise COPD risks, the study found.\n\nThey concluded: 'There is a biological plausibility that long-term exposure to irritant disinfectants and cleaning agents could contribute to persistent airway damage and COPD [development].'", "description": "University of Versailles and Harvard University researchers found that nurses who use bleach and ammonium day-in and day-out faced higher risks for lung diseases that are leading causes of death.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/16/19888120-0-image-a-11_1571412721420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
