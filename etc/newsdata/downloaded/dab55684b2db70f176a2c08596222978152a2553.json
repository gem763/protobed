Syrian government forces are aiming to re-establish their hold over the Kurdish-controlled section of Syria (shown in orange), while Turkey is attempting to create a 30-kilometre 'refugee safe-zone' to settle 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently residing in Turkey.\n\nThe Turkish president's comments come a day ahead of a visit by U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence to the Turkish capital Ankara. Pence is tasked with negotiating an end to the attacks along the Syrian border, while Erdogan will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Black Sea city of Sochi on Oct. 22, the Turkish presidency said.\n\nWith the Turkish assault in its eighth day, Turkish forces and Kurdish fighters were still battling heavily Wednesday over the border town of Ras al-Ayn. Turkey had announced it captured the town days ago, but its hold now appeared uncertain amid Kurdish incursion.\n\nTrump says Kurds are 'no angels'\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump played down the crisis on Wednesday and assailed his former Kurdish allies, saying they were \"no angels.\"\n\n\"The PKK, which is a part of the Kurds, as you know, is probably worse at terror and more of a terrorist threat in many ways than ISIS,\" Trump said, referring to the Kurdish insurgent group in Turkey linked to Syrian Kurdish fighters. The PKK is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and other countries.\n\nTrump said the conflict was between Turkey and Syria and that it was \"fine\" for Russia to help its ally Damascus. Sanctioning Turkey would be better than fighting in the region, he said.\n\nLater, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted its bipartisan condemnation of Trump's withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria. Despite stark divisions over Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump, Democrats and Republicans banded together Wednesday and approved a nonbinding resolution by 354-60 vote.\n\nThe resolution states the opposition to the troop pullback and says Turkey should cease its military action in Syria. And the measure says the White House should present a plan for an \"enduring defeat\" of ISIS.\n\nSenate Republicans also stood up for the Syrian Kurds; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the partnership \"a terrific alliance\" that set ISIS back and said he was \"sorry we are where we are.\"\n\nSen. Roy Blunt of Missouri added that Erdogan \"has not been a reliable ally. The Kurds have been a reliable ally.\"\n\nWashington announced sanctions to punish Turkey on Monday, but Trump's critics said the steps, mainly a steel tariffs hike and a pause in trade talks, were too feeble to have an impact.\n\nThe next day, U.S. prosecutors' charges were unveiled against Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank for taking part in a scheme to evade Iran sanctions. Washington says the case is unrelated to politics. Halkbank denies wrongdoing and called the case part of the sanctions against Turkey.\n\nErdogan said he will decide whether to go ahead with a planned visit next month to the United States after meetings with an American delegation in Turkey this week, while his spokesperson said Turkey's foreign ministry was preparing retaliation for U.S. sanctions. Erdogan and Trump are due to meet in Washington on Nov. 13.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council, meanwhile, voiced concern on Wednesday over the risks of a deterioration in the humanitarian situation in northeast Syria and the escape of ISIS fighters, but made no reference to the Turkish assault on Syrian Kurdish militia in the area that began a week ago.\n\nThe 15-member council agreed to the brief statement after meeting for the second time behind closed doors since the Turkish operation began, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee and raising doubt about the fate of thousands of ISIS fighters in Kurdish jails. Such Security Council statements are agreed by consensus; an attempt last Thursday to produce a statement failed, diplomats said.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft said separately after the council meeting that the U.S. called on Turkey to \"cease undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS, cease endangering civilians, cease threatening peace, security and stability in the region, cease its offensive and declare a ceasefire immediately.\"\n\nAs U.S. exits Syria, Russia moves to fill power void\n\nRussia has moved quickly to further entrench its leadership role in the region after Trump ordered the pullout of U.S. forces in northeastern Syria. The American move effectively abandoned Kurdish fighters and cleared the way for Turkey's invasion aimed at crushing them. After heavy criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, Washington then scrambled to find new leverage with the Turks, imposing economic sanctions aimed at forcing a ceasefire.\n\nThe abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops pushed the Kurds to strike a deal with the Russia-backed government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, allowing its forces to return to regions of northern Syria it had abandoned at the height of the eight-year-old civil war.\n\nRussian and Syrian national flags flutter Wednesday on military vehicles following the capture of Manbij, a Syrian town about 30 kilometres from the Turkish border. (Omar Sanadiki/Reuters)\n\nIt has also allowed Moscow to take a more prominent role as an interlocutor among Assad, the former U.S.-allied Kurds and the U.S.'s NATO ally Turkey.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is committed to mediating between the Syrian government and Turkey.\n\nRussia has already announced it had deployed troops outside the flashpoint town of Manbij to keep apart the two forces. Syrian forces took control of Manbij as U.S. troops completed their pullout from the town on Tuesday. The Syrian and Russian deployments appear to have thwarted Turkey's hopes to capture the town, located just west of the Euphrates River, in its offensive.\n\nIn another sign of Moscow's rising profile, France suggested it will also work more closely with Russia in Syria.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian said in an interview on French television channel BFM on Wednesday that France is notably now looking to Russia, given their \"common interests\" in defeating ISIS in Syria.\n\nHe called on the EU and other members of the coalition fighting ISIS in Syria to regroup as the U.S. appeared to abdicate its leadership role in the region.", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip\u00a0Erdogan\u00a0says Turkey\u00a0would not be coerced into stopping its offensive or accept offers for a mediation with the Kurdish fighters, which Turkey considers terrorists,\u00a0as the nation intensifies its military offensive into Syria.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322452.1571231173!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/serbia-turkey-erdogan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
