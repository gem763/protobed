But there were signs of recovery, including an increase in revenue at both Scottish resorts.\n\nThe president has 17 golf operations around the world. But unlike his licensing operations where he has sold his name for fee, he has spent hundreds of millions to buy and improve the clubs, a bold bet that he can buck the industry trend of bankruptcy and losses.\n\nThe numbers from Scotland so far have not been encouraging.\n\nAt Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort on the Irish Sea, which has hosted several British Opens, losses topped 10.8 million pounds ($13.2 million) last year, triple the loss from a year earlier, though much of that came from a hit in foreign exchange. Taking that out and one-time and non-cash costs, the club lost 210,000 pounds, or $257,000. Revenue jumped 20%.\n\nTrump\u2019s North Sea club overlooking a stretch of dramatic dunes also posted losses, though much lower \u2014 1.1 million pounds, or $1.3 million.\n\nSome in Scotland have praised Trump for bringing in tourists and helping businesses in the North Sea club area. But others have protested his comments about Mexican immigrants and have accused of him of bullying tactics in trying to buy up land and of harming the local dunes with his course.\n\nMore recently, the club has drawn protests from environmental groups and others over plans to build 550 homes on the property in what would be the biggest construction project for the president\u2019s company since he took office.\n\nResidents sent thousands of letters to local politicians, raising the prospect of heavy traffic and crowded schools, though others have argued the homes could provide a boost to the economy.\n\nLast month, a local government council approved the Trump club\u2019s plan for expansion, a potentially big source of cash. A marketing brochure says buyers should be prepared to pay as much as 1.3 million pounds for the biggest homes, or $1.6 million each.", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's two golf resorts in Scotland posted another year of multimillion-dollar losses as his properties contend with a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/6ec3be_trump-golf-scottish-losses-72031-2009-file-photo-shows-turnberry-lighthouse-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
