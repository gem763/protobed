It was co-written by Johnny Mercer, who grew up in Savannah, Ga. And it was on a family trip there that Bill Canning, who's never seen \"Breakfast At Tiffany's,\" first heard Mercer's recording of the song.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MOON RIVER\")\n\nJOHNNY MERCER: (Singing) Moon River, wider than a mile, I'm crossing you in style someday.\n\nBILL CANNING: And I thought - just was a beautiful song. It was very evocative of that kind of part of the South. But it had such beautiful lines that really kind of resonated with me.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Canning is from Fayetteville, Ga., just south of Atlanta. He's a father of two, and that version of \"Moon River\" quickly became his signature song.\n\nCANNING: It has a very romantic quality, not in the sense of love, but just these big, grand ideas about companionship. And I really kind of latched onto the second verse where he opens up with, you know, two drifters off to see the world.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MOON RIVER\")\n\nMERCER: (Singing) Off to see the world. There's such a lot of world to see...\n\nCANNING: I kind of think that that's a great encapsulation of what it's like to be a parent with a young child - with any child, really - but just the idea that, you know, we're in this together. We're going to go explore the world together. I thought that was such a beautiful line.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: At the time, James, his 3-year-old, got fussy at bedtime. Canning decided to sing \"Moon River,\" and James calmed right down.\n\nCANNING: Once I saw that it was actually working and that he was kind of getting quiet and kind of snuggling up next to me as I rocked him in a chair, I kind of thought that this is good. I'll keep going with it and make this part of the routine. And so it's been working ever since.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MOON RIVER\")\n\nMERCER: (Singing) Moon River and me.\n\nCANNING: We have a great clip of him on the swing set when he was maybe 1 1/2 or 2, and he was singing \"Moon River\" to himself.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You can sing \"Moon River.\"\n\nJAMES: (Singing) Moon river, (unintelligible).\n\nCANNING: I teach middle school, so I'm very well aware of, you know, the difficulties fraught in that age. And I'm kind of hoping that, you know, it's routine and it's a habit and it's a ritual. And so even when he, you know, might get older and a little bit too cool for it, hopefully the bond that this has created and this kind of companionship we have will transcend and continue to go with it. And I - I'm cautiously optimistic that it'll work.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MOON RIVER\")\n\nMERCER: (Singing) Rainbow's end, waiting round the bend.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Bill Canning of Fayette, Ga., sharing his signature song \"Moon River\" by Johnny Mercer.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MOON RIVER\")\n\nMERCER: (Singing) Moon River and me.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: You're listening to WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.
