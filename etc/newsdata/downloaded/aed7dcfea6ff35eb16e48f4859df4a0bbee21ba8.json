Amy Klobuchar spoke with the Register's editorial board about drug competition, negotiating Medicare and insulin. Des Moines Register\n\nEditorial: It was clear Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar could spend days detailing the intricacies of everything from the farm bill and biofuels to carbon pricing and trade policy.\n\nAfter meeting with U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Des Moines Register editorial board member made this observation: It sure would be nice to see this smart, competent senator representing Iowa, not Minnesota.\n\nNods all around.\n\nExcept Klobuchar's relocation plan is to move to the big white house in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate, with a voice rough from campaign speeches, seemed right at home with Register reporters and editors.\n\nPerhaps because her father was a newspaperman.\n\nPerhaps because she\u2019s spent decades answering questions and working rooms \u2014 as a lawyer, prosecutor and the first woman elected to represent Minnesota in the Senate.\n\nAfter spilling a little java on the conference room table, which she called a \u201ccoffee malfunction,\u201d she delved right into issues with remarkable detail \u2014 easily summoning names, dollar figures, rankings and statistics from memory.\n\nWhen asked why she was running for president, she talked about the Interstate 35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis in 2007, which killed 13 people. Victims worked to save one another. Politicians, including her, came together to fund and expedite construction.\n\n\u201cThat is American spirit,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThat is a country bigger than any individual.\u201d The current president \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to see that heart of America or that spirit.\u201d\n\nThere is a crisis of trust in this country, she said, and people feel separated from each other and their government. That is not how it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nKlobuchar supports health care reform that brings down prices, gets more people insured and uses a public option such as Medicare or Medicaid to expand coverage. She relished having more time than debates allow to talk about pharmaceutical legislation and a Minnesota man who died after rationing his insulin.\n\nBig Pharma has two lobbyists for every member of Congress, she said, and politicians need to stand up to the industry.\n\nThis is the kind of common-sense message that should resonate with Democrats and Republicans. In fact, much of what Klobuchar says transcends political divides. The proof of that: She was easily re-elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012 and 2018, carrying even conservative areas of Minnesota.\n\nShe embraces bipartisanship in revitalizing rural communities \u2014 citing steps such as securing funding for hospitals, welcoming immigrant labor and ensuring internet access. If you can get broadband next to a volcano in Iceland, we should be able to get it in Nebraska, she said.\n\nThough we had only an hour with her, it was clear she could spend days detailing the intricacies of everything from the farm bill and biofuels to carbon pricing and trade policy. She made an economic case for immigration reform, something the current president should be doing.\n\nYet she said lawmakers are afraid of Trump, a man who \u201cliterally wakes up and tweets to divide people. That\u2019s how he makes news. He pisses off the entire country of Denmark, which isn\u2019t easy to do. But he did it.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s good with one-liners, and her quick-witted sense of humor reared its head more than once: \"What\u2019s the difference between Greenland and Donald Trump? Only one of them is for sale.\"\n\nShe recognized China has been a bad actor, manipulating currency, stealing intellectual property and committing other misdeeds. Then she went on to illustrate Trump's erratic and misguided approach by citing the dates of his flip-flops in the past month, which contribute to the \u201cchaos in our trade policy.\u201d\n\nA graduate of Yale University and the University of Chicago Law School, she said she has great respect for judges and the courts.\n\nIowans may remember her exchange last year with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during a Senate hearing. Klobuchar asked him if he\u2019d ever blacked out while drinking and he shot back: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Have you?\u201d He later apologized.\n\n\u201cYou bring down the entire judiciary when you talk like that,\u201d she told a Register editorial board member. She wants to bring back integrity in talking about the justice system.\n\nJust as important, she wants to restore integrity to the White House.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump is on TV, many people turn down the volume. That wasn\u2019t true of past presidents.\u201d Even viewers who didn\u2019t agree felt it was important to pay respect to the office and the individual, but that is no longer the case, she observes.\n\nAnd she is likely right on the mark when she said no one would have to turn down the television volume if she is president.\n\n\u2014 Andie Dominick\n\nThis editorial is the opinion of the Des Moines Register\u2019s editorial board: Carol Hunter, executive editor; Kathie Obradovich, opinion editor; Andie Dominick, editorial writer, and Richard Doak and Rox Laird, editorial board members.\n\nWant more opinions?
