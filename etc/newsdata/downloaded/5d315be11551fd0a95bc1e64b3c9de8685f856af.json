The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe White House says Kushner is preparing to release an oft-delayed Mideast peace plan in which Saudi Arabia is expected to play a significant role. The White House has not said when Kushner will present the plan, but the official said it is not expected to happen during the upcoming visit.\n\nIsrael's post-election political paralysis has complicated Kushner's mission.\n\nNeither Netanyahu nor Gantz secured a parliamentary majority in the Sept. 17 election. Attempts at forming a unity government have so far been unsuccessful.", "description": "President Donald Trump's top Mideast adviser, Jared Kushner, will visit Saudi Arabia and Israel at the end of the month, a senior U.S. official said Thursday.
