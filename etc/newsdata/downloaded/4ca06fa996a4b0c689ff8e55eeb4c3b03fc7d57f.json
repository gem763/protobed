It\u2019s perhaps best known as the mechanism President Obama used for his deportation amnesty for Dreamers \u2014 DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 but it\u2019s long been a more limited power the government has had in other cases.\n\nUSCIS\u2019s decision earlier this month to curtail deferred action approvals was a misstep by the agency, which had been on a winning streak in fulfilling President Trump\u2019s immigration goals. USCIS said at the time that another agency, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, could still use deferred action to stop deportations at the back end.\n\nUSCIS insisted that ICE was the right agency.\n\nBut ICE officials said they were blindsided by the announcement.\n\n\u201cWe have no program to do this. We have no intention of taking this over,\u201d an ICE official said at the time.\n\nThe move also spurred a series of stories in the press of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and dealing with health conditions \u2014 either their own or their children\u2019s \u2014 who\u2019d had requests for deferred action denied and were fearing they\u2019d be deported.\n\nOne activist called the move \u201ca death sentence\u201d for migrants affected.\n\n\u201cDeporting caretakers of U.S. citizen children with serious medical conditions is an affront to common decency and American values \u2014 and forces parents to choose between family separation or a death sentence,\u201d said the Rev. John L. McCullough, president of Church World Service.\n\nAdvocacy groups said USCIS made the change without advance notice, denying the public a chance to weigh in beforehand.\n\nIt appeared the agency knew its move would be controversial, since it explicitly said it wouldn\u2019t apply to cases involving the military, which are among the most sympathetic figures in any immigration debate.\n\nDeferred action isn\u2019t supposed to be a legal status, though some migrants are able to use it as a bridge to remain in the U.S. while they wait for another avenue of legal status to come open, such as a family-based green card.\n\nUSCIS said in looking at the applications already pending, it will make \u201ccase-by-case discretionary decisions\u201d about who is worthy. And the agency suggested it is looking to scale down the program so its adjudicators can work on other immigration benefits.\n\n\u201cAs USCIS\u2019 deferred action caseload is reduced, the career employees who decide such cases will be more available to address other types of legal immigration applications on a more efficient basis,\u201d the agency said in a statement announcing the program\u2019s limited reboot.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
