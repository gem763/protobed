Two weeks later, there were even less (pictured B), leading to a diagnosis of failed bone marrow\n\nBut his symptoms persisted, leading him to doctors at Christian Medical College and Hospital in Vellore.\n\nDr John Titus George and colleagues said the man had 'depigmented patches over his lips, shins and forearms' on arrival.\n\nInitially, doctors thought he may have an inflammatory bowel disease, but tests then revealed he had deficiencies in his blood cells.\n\nHOW MUCH LEVAMISOLE IS IN COCAINE? Levamisole has become a major cutting agent in cocaine across the world, according to studies. Between 40 to 90 percent of cocaine contains the drug, which can have adverse side effects - including agranulocytosis, an acute condition involving a severe and dangerous lowered white blood cell count. In the UK, Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker ordered an analysis of seized cocaine shipments in 2014 which showed that around 80 per cent contained the medicine. And the UK has a higher rate of cocaine use than anywhere else in Europe, with 9.7 per cent of people having reported using the drug, according to The Office For National Statistics. Studies have found Levamisole in 57 per cent of Spanish cocaine samples, 90 per cent of Danish samples, and 60 per cent of Dutch samples. In April 2011, a report by the US Drug Enforcement Administration found that 82 per cent of seized cocaine contained Levamisole. Concentrations range between five and 12 per cent, with an average of 11 per cent, according to an analysis of 103 random cocaine samples from around the world, conducted by the Energy Control drug testing service.\n\nHe had neutropenia \u2013 when white blood cells are abnormally low \u2013 putting him in life-threatening danger if he contracts an infection.\n\nTests showed his total white blood cell count was 0.5 x 109 cells per litre, well below the normal range of 4.3 x 109 cells per litre.\n\nA bone marrow biopsy revealed he was missing vital myeloid cells, which are white blood cells that fight bacterial infections, defend the body against parasites and prevent the spread of tissue damage.\n\nMegakaryoctes were also missing, which are cells that produce platelets necessary for blood clotting.\n\nDoctors immediately administered growth factors that spur the production of white blood cells, as well as platelet transfusions.\n\nA fortnight later, with no improvements to his blood count, the patient was examined again.\n\nIt was then doctors discovered his bone marrow was empty of any cells, leading to a diagnosis of bone marrow failure induced by levamisole.\n\nWhile he was being 'worked up' for a stem cell transplant, things took a turn for the worse.\n\nHis bowel became increasingly inflamed, caused by the levamisole, leading to a hole in his abdomen wall.\n\nThe patient's blood became riddled with a bacteria called Klebsiella pneumonia, causing septic shock.\n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae normally live in the intestines and faeces without causing harm, but cause severe infection if they spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThe doctors wrote: 'His condition continued to deteriorate, and he succumbed to his illness.'\n\nThey concluded that doctors using levamisole should be monitored closely due to the adverse side effects reported.\n\nThese include kidney failure, high blood pressure, brain disease and agranulocytosis - an acute condition involving a severe and dangerous lowered white blood cell count.", "description": "The 20-year-old from India used Levamisole for a skin condition.
