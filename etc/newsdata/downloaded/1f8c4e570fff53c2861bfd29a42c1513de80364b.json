The deal was estimated to be worth $9.4 billion (8.5 billion euros) at the time.\n\nThe new agreement, signed the following year, named Reliance group, a conglomerate owned by billionaire Anil Ambani that has little experience in aviation, as Dassault\u2019s local partner.\n\nAmbani is reported to be close to India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) party.\n\nModi and the government deny any misconduct, and in December, India\u2019s top court dismissed calls for an investigation into the deal, saying it saw no evidence of \u201ccommercial favouritism\u201d.\n\nMandated to be able to deal with two conflicts at once \u2014 with China and Pakistan \u2014 the Indian Air Force is meant to have 42 squadrons but struggles to put together 33, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\n\u201cCombat aviation for them is\u2026 a strategic asset,\u201d said Jean-Paul Palomeros, former chief of staff of the French Air Force and an expert at the CEIS strategic intelligence firm.\n\n\u201cAs such, its renovation is both political and a high military priority.\u201d\n\nAs part of Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d programme to encourage local manufacturing, the Rafale contract provides for domestic \u201coffset\u201d deals.\n\n\u201cNearly 60 French companies are already established in India\u2026 and in the future more companies will come,\u201d said Parly, the French defence minister.\n\nThe Rafale has been used by the French army since 2004 but struggled for several years to land foreign clients.\n\nFrance finally security contracts with Egypt and Qatar in 2015, for 24 jets each, on top of the Indian deal.\n\nIn 2017, Doha took out an option on 12 more.\n\nThe 36 Indian Rafales will be based in Ambala, near Kashmir and the Pakistani border, and at Hasimara in West Bengal state near the border with Bhutan.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 India received Tuesday the first of 36 Rafale fighter jets ordered from France in 2016 in a multi-billion-dollar deal that Paris hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/962e7a_36-rafale-fighter-jets-india-it-renew-its-ageing-fleet-combat-aircraft-india-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
