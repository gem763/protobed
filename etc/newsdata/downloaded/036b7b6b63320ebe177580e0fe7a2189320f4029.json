To make the most of them, our members need useful digital tools to help them understand their energy usage.\n\n'That's why we're excited to announce this new tool which will help our members to use less energy, save on their bills and lower carbon emissions.'\n\nCustomers will be able to see how much energy each device is using, for example, how much electricity a dishwasher uses in a wash and how much gas a hob uses when it is on.\n\nA look at what the SmartThings service will show customers regarding their energy bills\n\nIt will also provide data on carbon intensity so households can make more environmentally conscious decisions about when to use their energy.\n\nCustomers can, for example, run pre-set oven programmes or dishwasher cycles outside of peak cycles.\n\n\n\nTeg Dosanjh, Director of Connected Living at Samsung Electronics UK and Ireland, said: 'We know that up to 40 percent of UK carbon emissions are created in the home.\n\n'While smart meters help increase awareness of energy usage, digital technology can help to create the behaviour changes required to really make a difference to people's pockets and their carbon footprint.\n\n'With SmartThings Energy Control, we're taking energy data off the wall and putting it into people's hands.'\n\nSmartThings Energy Control is available today to current Bulb customers who have a second generation (SMETS2) smart meter installed. These consumers can simply download the SmartThings app on an iOS or Android device.\n\nAnyone else looking to join will need to have a SMETS2 meter installed before they can use the SmartThings service.\n\nHow does this compare to other smart home tech?\n\nThe SmartThings service bears many similarities to other smart home tech products. There is a growing number of new products being introduced, all aiming to make customers lives easier.\n\nHive is one such example of a smart energy service that more and more people are having installed in their homes.\n\nSimilar to how Bulb customers will be able to control their energy usage from their phones and tablets, Hive users can turn their heating and hot water on and off from their phone.\n\nEnergy saving: Philips smart lightbulbs can be turned on and off via an app throughout the day\n\nHive claims that not having to heat an empty house can save customers \u00a3120 a year.\n\nNest is another brand that offers a similar service - it also learns the temperature you like when you're at home and turns itself down when you\u2019re away.\n\nPhilips also offer energy saving lightbulbs. The Philips Hue starter kit contains lightbulbs that then let the user set them to come on at certain times of day, for example, to slowly wake them up in the morning. The lights can also be turned off or on from your smartphone.\n\nSmart plugs are another piece of smart home technology helping customers reduce their energy usage and giving users peace of mind.\n\nThey allow people to control items plugged into the smart plug through their phone or tablet.\n\nFor example, if you forgot to turn the iron off at home and it was plugged in to a smart plug, you would be able to turn it off without having to return home.\n\nOne of the plugs that comes highly recommended is the Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug with Energy Monitoring from TP-Link.\n\nThis plug tracks your device\u2019s power consumption in real-time and can give you weekly and monthly summaries. It can also be voice controlled when paired with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or Microsoft Cortana.", "description": "It tells users exactly how much they have spent in a day on energy, at what time of the day they have used the most energy as well as seeing how much energy each device has used.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
