The report is arguably one of the most comprehensive assessments to date on the effects of climate change on the Earth\u2019s oceans and frozen water. And it points to a problem scientists are growing more concerned about: marine heat waves.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of robust scientific evidence that shows that extreme heat events on land are getting worse as climate change accelerates. But land dwellers aren\u2019t the only ones feeling the burn. A growing body of research is examining similar events underwater, when the seas experience periods of unusually warm temperatures.\n\n\u201cThis is a phenomena that we should be placing higher attention on,\u201d Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC, said in a press briefing. Marine heat waves, she said, are an \u201cemerging issue\u201d and this is the first time that the United Nations body has dedicated so much study to it.\n\nMore than 100 scientists spanning over 30 countries contributed to the study, called the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. It was unveiled during a meeting of the intergovernmental panel in Monaco just one day after the United Nations held a special summit in New York where Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called on countries to step up their plans to avert climate crisis.\n\nThe frequency of heat waves in oceans has very likely doubled since 1982\n\nThe report found that the frequency of heat waves in oceans has very likely doubled since 1982. And things are probably going to get worse. By 2081, the frequency of these extreme events could jump by 20 to 50 times, depending on how successful the world is at cutting down on the greenhouse gas emissions heating our planet. In a scenario with continued high emissions, those underwater extreme heat events could become ten times more intense.\n\nThey\u2019re already brutal. In 2014 and 2015, a heat wave called \u201cthe Blob\u201d appeared in the Pacific and wreaked havoc on marine ecosystems from Hawaii to Alaska. The high temperatures can kill coral reefs, strand sea lions on shore, and shut down fisheries and crabbing. And since ocean temperatures have an effect on weather systems, the blob even came after California \u2014 contributing to an epic drought in 2014 that the American Geophysical Union said was the worst in the region in 1,200 years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say this is an important area of scientific understanding that\u2019s emerged in the last few years,\u201d Stanford professor and senior fellow Noah Diffenbaugh, who was not involved with the IPCC report, tells The Verge. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an emergence of these marine heatwaves in the ocean conditions, we\u2019re seeing an emergence of their impacts on ecosystems and communities. And we\u2019re seeing an emergence of their remote influence on weather and climate over land.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a potentially concerning new \u201cblob\u201d \u2014 an area of unusually warm water marked red on maps \u2014 developing in the Pacific that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is monitoring. \u201cIt\u2019s on a trajectory to be as strong as the prior event,\u201d Andrew Leising, a research scientist at NOAA Fisheries\u2019 Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, California, said in a statement from the agency this month. \u201cAlready, on its own, it is one of the most significant events that we\u2019ve seen.\u201d The agency acknowledged that previously unexpected events like the Blob are becoming more common.\n\n\u201cwe don\u2019t know what fires are being lit under the sea\u201d\n\nEven outside of these heat waves, the ocean is warming up. The report found that the rate of ocean warming has likely more than doubled since 1993. The ocean is storing more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by human activity. \u201cThe ocean is sort of becoming the sacrificial lamb,\u201d Francisco Chavez, senior scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, tells The Verge. He says we need to be paying much more attention to how that\u2019s affecting life at sea.\n\n\u201cWe can immediately tell that there\u2019s these enormous forest fires consuming parts of the Amazon forest, for example, but we don\u2019t know what fires are being lit under the sea,\u201d Chavez says. \u201cThe ocean is kind of out of sight out of mind, compared to the terrestrial systems.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s more to worry about than the temperature rising, according to the IPCC report. Climate change is also contributing to oxygen loss and increased acidity in the ocean. And water woes are reaching land as the rate of sea-level rise due to ice melt and warm ocean water expanding increases.\n\n\u201cThe consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe. This report highlights the urgency of timely, ambitious, coordinated and enduring action,\u201d IPCC\u2019s Barrett said. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the health of ecosystems, wildlife, and importantly, the world we leave our children.\u201d", "description": "Oceans are increasingly taking the heat from climate change, according to a major new report published today by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
