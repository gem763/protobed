I get so mad when I see these because a lot of good people are scared by irresponsible \u201canalysts.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDon\u2019t let these myths stop you. There are too many good opportunities out there to grow your wealth.\n\nMarket Myth #1: The stock market is overvalued.\n\nI am sure you have heard this over and over in the financial media. It has been the number one talking point for bears over the last five years. That\u2019s a long time to be wrong over and over again.\n\nThey point to valuation metrics that are either bogus or backward-looking. The forward P/E ratio on the S&P 500 is currently 16.5. The reading is only slightly above the market\u2019s long-term average and nowhere near overbought.\n\nStocks are fairly valued, and more importantly, they are set to continue growing earnings the rest of this year and even throughout 2020.\n\nThe next time you hear a talking head say the market is overbought, turn off the TV and call a loved one. OR\u2026 buy your favorite stock!\n\nMarket Myth #2: A global recession is imminent.\n\nA recent survey by The Wall Street Journal showed a high number of economists expecting a recession in the next 12 months. About one-third of economists predict a recession in the next year.\n\nA quick reminder \u2026 a recession is two consecutive quarters of a contracting economy measured by negative GDP growth. The latest GDP reading from the second quarter shows 2.1% growth. There has to be a big and sudden drop for a recession to occur.\n\nLet me see if I can put this nicely. Economists are some of the absolute worst predictors of recessions \u2014 or really anything to do with the economy. Think of them like your local meteorologists. When you turn on the television and the forecasters tell you it will rain today \u2014 and it is already raining outside! \u2014 it\u2019s pretty obvious. Crazy enough, economists CANNOT even do that.\n\nA 2018 study by Prakah Loungani and two others looked at 153 recessions in 63 countries from 1992 to 2014. Only five \u2014 just 3% \u2014 were predicted by April of the preceding year. Since 1998, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has never predicted a recession in a developed country with a lead of anything more than a few months.\n\nI love visuals and had to share the chart below with you to calm your recession fears. Or at a minimum, I hope it helps you stop making investment decisions based on anything an economist preaches.\n\nFew Hits, Lots of Misses More\n\nMarket Myth #3: The Federal Reserve has to go OR the Federal Reserve has to lower interest rates more.\n\nStory continues", "description": "I love writing to you about the big trends and investment themes giving us the opportunity to multiply our money many times over.
