Before the injection it was painful. I actually couldn\u2019t lift my arm with the ball.\u201d\n\nThe injury curtailed Rashid\u2019s summer following the dramatic World Cup final victory over New Zealand in July, with the Yorkshireman forgoing surgery and deciding instead on treating the problem with rest and rehabilitation.\n\nHe returned to action on Sunday for the first time in three months and was the pick of England\u2019s attack with two for 25 in the six-wicket victory over a New Zealand XI in a Twenty20 warm-up in Lincoln.\n\nWhile Rashid admitted he is still not firing on all cylinders, he is in an optimistic mood ahead of the start of the five-match T20 series against the Black Caps, which gets under way in Christchurch on Friday.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom three months ago to now, it\u2019s got a lot better. I would still say it\u2019s not 100 per cent but that\u2019s something I\u2019m working towards and hopefully I can get that soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve still not quite got my snap that I would like, personally. But hopefully that will come as time goes on, maybe before the first T20 my snap might be there, the pace I want to bowl to.\n\n\u201cBut at this moment in time, it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve got to really drive towards and look forward to getting it stronger.\u201d\n\nRashid will be rested for the second practice match at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval on Tuesday, with Matt Parkinson a like-for-like replacement.\n\nParkinson was one of three touring players \u2013 alongside batsman Dawid Malan and seamer Pat Brown \u2013 who travelled to the venue a few miles south west of England\u2019s Christchurch base for an optional training session on Monday afternoon.\n\nPA", "description": "Adil Rashid is hopeful of quickly rediscovering the \u201csnap\u201d in his bowling action after a shoulder injury which he suspects would have ruled him out of England\u2019s triumphant World Cup campaign without two injections.
