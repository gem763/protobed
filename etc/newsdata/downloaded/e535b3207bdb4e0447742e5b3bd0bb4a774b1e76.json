The left-leaning candidate is running with populist ex-leader Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.\n\nThe unofficial \"blue chip\" peso rate would likely spike to 80 pesos per dollar, from 74 pesos now. The official spot rate would be more muted, rising to 65 pesos from 58 pesos now, the average response from economists showed.\n\nBond prices would also take a significant hit, the poll showed, with estimates for the country risk index hitting 2,200 basis points, above the current level of around 2,060 points.\n\nThe official peso-dollar rate, however, would be cushioned to a degree by capital controls imposed last month by Macri to help stave off a further sharp depreciation of the currency and stem a drain on the country's foreign reserves.\n\nThe steep primary victory suggested Fernandez would win enough votes in the October election to sweep his party into power without needing a second round runoff in November. He would need 45% of votes, or 40% and a 10-point lead over Macri.\n\n'MILD POPULISM'\n\nThe economists, who mostly spoke on condition of anonymity, forecast that a Fern\u00e1ndez administration would be \"mild populist\", seeking to cool inflation and revive the sluggish economy, but edging away from Macri's more free-market approach.\n\nHowever, analysts were skeptical about the chances of policies touted by Fern\u00e1ndez so far, such as cuts to sky-high interest rates or boosting taxation.\n\n\"Inflation is unlikely to fall in 2020 with these measures; reserves will keep falling and it's very hard for them to reach a fiscal surplus with tax increases alone,\" said David Kohn, economics professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.\n\nIn the short term, the focus is on how Fernandez would deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other creditors, after the country was forced to delay payments on around $100 billion of local and foreign debt.\n\nFalling into default would be hugely damaging for Latin America's third largest economy, making it once more a pariah of global investors and shutting off important funding channels.\n\nMost of the economists polled said Fernandez would have to meet investors \"half-way\", with likely prolonged negotiations that meant no quick solution, but that would also probably avoid a full-on default.\n\n\"The IMF will have to negotiate with Fern\u00e1ndez ... because it will want to avoid a financial crisis that could easily impact emerging markets,\" said Andres Abadia, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\n\"Fern\u00e1ndez needs the IMF and private debt, and he will have to make concessions to generate some confidence.\" (Reporting by Gabriel Burin; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Daniel Wallis)", "description": "Argentine markets, in a holding pattern since a crash in August, are set for a new bout of nerves after the country holds a presidential election on Sunday, likely to confirm defeat for business-friendly President Mauricio Macri.
