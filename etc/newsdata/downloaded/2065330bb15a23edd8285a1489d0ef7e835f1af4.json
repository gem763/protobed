Morey soon deleted the tweet and apologized.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey insisted.\n\n2/ I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nRegardless, the league quickly pushed out a statement slapping Morey down and trying to make amends with their business partners in China.\n\nWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together\n\nThis is the same league that canceled games in North Carolina because the Tar Heel State had a \u201chuman rights abusing\u201d transgender bathroom law. But they seem to have no problem with China, one of the most oppressive nations in the world with one of the worst human rights records of any modern nation.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s all because of the money the NBA is making as it tries to expand into foreign markets?\n\nThe repercussions of Morey\u2019s tweet and the NBA\u2019s response have been reverberating all across the league.\n\nImmediately, there were stories claiming that Morey could be fired for daring to support the democracy movement in Hong Kong, though the NBA, at least, said there will be no official action taken against the GM for his tweet.\n\nRockets Owner Tilman Fertitta told ESPN that Morey\u2019s job is not in jeopardy.\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association also jumped into action and officially cut ties with the Houston Rockets.\n\nOutkick the Coverage\u2019s Clay Travis wondered if some of the NBA\u2019s most \u201cwoke\u201d would respond:\n\nWill outspoken NBA woke activists @SteveKerr, @KingJames & Greg Popovich stand up for Daryl Morey and his support of democracy in Hong Kong? They\u2019re awfully outspoken about Trump. Surely they\u2019ll condemn the NBA bending the knee to China over a GM\u2019s support for democracy, right? \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 7, 2019\n\nThis NBA-Hong Kong-China mess is fascinating. The NBA is super woke when it comes to things like made up US transgender bathroom disputes, but bent the knee to China when Daryl Morey came out in support of democracy & upset communists. Shows you how hypocritical the league is. \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 7, 2019\n\nTravis also wondered is super woke ESPN, which is broadcasting from China this week, will side with democracy or with oppressors:\n\nESPN is set to broadcast from China this week. The woke league with the woke broadcasting network. All shilling for Chinese communists. Y\u2019all think they\u2019ll say anything at all? Ha ha. The hypocrisy is crazy. When the NBA pulled out of Charlotte ESPN praised them to high heavens. pic.twitter.com/Y3ZySBJc7c \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 7, 2019\n\nBut while the NBA seems prepared to side with human rights abusers in China, a bi-partisan group of politicians do not, including pols who usually stand on the opposite side of the issues, such as Ted Cruz and Eric Swalwell.\n\nWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nChina is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S. The United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government. https://t.co/87U4jgsAAp \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 7, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the @NBA is more interested in money than human rights. Tonight\u2019s statement from Commissioner Silver is an absolute joke. The NBA is kowtowing to Beijing to protect their bottom line and disavowing those with the temerity to #standwithHongKong. Shameful! https://t.co/RBPJa04xzK \u2014 Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) October 7, 2019\n\nListen\u2026.some things are more important than money. Like doing the right thing. @dmorey tweeted about human rights and supporting #HongKongProtests. How ironic that you\u2019re siding with communism to advance your greed. https://t.co/RoyJ3o3bbY \u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) October 7, 2019\n\nSenator Ben Sasse (R, Neb) also took a stick to the NBA saying the league\u2019s shameful apology for Morey\u2019s tweet puts the concerns of the oppressive Chinese government and the NBA\u2019s lust for money ahead of democracy for Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cBasketball fans and the American people more broadly should have absolutely no doubt about what is happening here: The NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights. In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing,\u201d Sasse said in a statement Monday morning.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "The National Basketball Association came to the side of the oppressive Chinese government and delivered a sharp rebuke to Houston Rockets", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/gty-andy-lyons-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
