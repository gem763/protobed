The ball went right at Adams who opted to block the baseball with his chest rather than drop his beers.\n\nAdams' unconventional approach to securing a home run ball went viral. He was interviewed by publications around the world, and he even credited his Little League coach for inspiring his chest-first defensive mechanics.\n\nThis also provided a free marketing platform for Bud Light. In return for the free pub, Bud Light has opted to reward Adams with \u2026 wait for it \u2026 a trip to Game 6 of the World Series in Houston \u2014 just as long as he wears this #BRAND friendly shirt.\n\nIn a sense, it's cool that Adams was able to leverage letting a baseball hit him in the chest into a free trip to Houston for the World Series and some unexpected publicity. But man, I really hope Bud Light and Anheuser-Busch InBev are throwing some money Adams' way.\n\nAccording to brand-enthusiast Darren Rovell, Adams' beer-saving, chest defense gave Bud Light a free $7.2 million in marketing value.\n\nI'd like to think that Adams deserves more than a corporate-funded trip to a baseball game just to be a living, breathing billboard. But we already know how the world works:\n\n\"I Made A Free Seven Figures For The World's Largest Megabrewer And All I Got Was This T-shirt.\"\n\nWe can expect to see Adams in Houston wearing the shirt for Tuesday's game at 5:07 p.m. ET.", "description": "Bud Light rewards Jeff Adams, the beer-holding Nationals fan who blocked a home run ball with his chest, with a trip to World Series Game 6.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f1252312d3c514fca6a152bee30e54e84d916db9/c=0-312-4174-2660/local/-/media/2019/10/29/USATODAY/usatsports/usa-baseball-mlb-world-series-1-e1572224979455.jpg?width=3200&height=1801&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
