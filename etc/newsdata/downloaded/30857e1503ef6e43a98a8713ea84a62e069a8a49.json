Boone Pickens question", "language": "en", "text": "Oklahoma State Cowboys football coach Mike Gundy is no stranger at going off on reporters, and on Monday he went viral for another tirade over a question about the late T. Boone Pickens.\n\nPickens, the late business oil magnate who died earlier this month, was a major Oklahoma State booster. He pledged $165 million to Oklahoma State in 2005 \u2013 the largest gift to an athletic department in NCAA history. The donation helped change the direction of the Cowboys football team.\n\nT. BOONE PICKENS TRANSFORMED OKLAHOMA STATE FOOTBALL WITH A STILL RECORD DONATION\n\nGundy on Monday was asked about a satirical article that stated Pickens left the coach $30 in his will so Gundy can get a haircut and get rid of his trademark mullet. A reporter asked if there was any truth about the report.\n\n\u201cI would prefer to answer real journalism questions and not be disrespectful to Mr. Pickens at this time,\u201d Gundy said, according to the Tulsa World. \u201cAny jack--- like you that would ask a stupid question like that is really hurting journalism and making real media people look bad.\u201d\n\nNORTHWESTERN'S PAT FITZGERALD GIVES EPIC RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS OVER HIS GAME PLAN AFTER BLOWOUT LOSS\n\nGundy then added: \u201cDon\u2019t hurt the real journalism world... It\u2019s jacka--es like you that cause problems, OK? They shouldn\u2019t even let you call in. Do you want to talk football? We\u2019ll talk football. If you want to be out there and talk idiotic social media, then you need to go do something with a college kid.\u201d\n\nHeartland College Sports captured some of the exchange and posted it on Twitter.\n\nGundy isn\u2019t known for having a chummy relationship with the press. He famously dressed down a reporter during a news conference over an article about one of his players.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOklahoma State is 3-1 this season and suffered a close loss to the Texas Longhorns on Saturday.
