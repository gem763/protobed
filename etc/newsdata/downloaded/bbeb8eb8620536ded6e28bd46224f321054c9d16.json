But a lot of people don't realize that tech products and services, whether that be sold to the enterprise or sold to the consumer, you know typically are cyclical.\"\n\nHe expects the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which is up 23% year-to-date, will fall 10%.\n\nDespite his pullback warning, Meeks plans to put money to work.\n\n\"I always have my eye on my favorite tech names, and I look for opportunities to buy them on dips,\" he said.", "description": "The investor who ran the world's biggest tech fund for Merrill Lynch tells investors what to buy and sell.", "authors": ["Stephanie Landsman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103900068-Screen_Shot_2016-08-29_at_2.26.26_PM.png?v=1545081713", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
