In the run-up to the fair, though, it turned out that the machine\u2019s limit was much lower, so he settled on half that sum. A bargain, you might think. Still, when I visited, late on the fair\u2019s opening day, only one person had opened their wallet \u2013 and their card was rejected.\n\nThis is the thing about Frieze: if you\u2019re going to buy, you need a generous credit limit.", "description": "It can be tiring traipsing around the annual Frieze London art fair in Regent\u2019s Park \u2013 which is why, when you pass Tokyo gallery Taro Nasu\u2019s booth, you may find yourself drawn to a black vending machine.", "authors": ["Alastair Sooke", "Chief Art Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2019/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000211753810-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXLf5rZYUXGKwZgSx01hvqM6T_jUvnMCoL5ZYVvOIg50.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
