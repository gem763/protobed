It shows the actual return of various markets in their respective currencies. It can be observed that with respect to 1 year return, India now has the 2nd best performing equity market among its peers. However on a 10 year return basis, South Korea is the best performer followed by US, Philippines and India which is at fourth position.\n\nActual Returns in respective currencies\n\nIf we compare all the markets on a common ground, i.e. return in Dollar denominated terms, India still stands as having 2nd best performing stock market among its peers. However, in terms of 10 year\u2019s return, South Korea again has the best performing stock market, followed by US. India stands at 7th position. Below table shows the same.\n\nDollar Equivalent returns\n\nAll said and done, what does it mean for an Indian investor? The below table shows the return in Rupee equivalent terms, meaning if any Indian investor invests in these markets then, taking rupee appreciation/depreciation into consideration what would be the return. On a 1-year return basis, India still stands 2nd in terms of performance. It could also be noticed that for an Indian investor, investing in only 2 other markets would have been profitable, i.e Brazil and the Philippines, rest all other markets performed poorly, in fact investing in them would have incurred losses in rupee equivalent terms. However, on a 10-year return basis, investing in US markets would have yielded the highest return both because of good performance of US equities as well as Dollar appreciation. Other countries where an Indian investor received good returns were the Philippines, Thailand, Japan, and Germany. The important limitation to understand here is that Indian individuals can make offshore investments up-to USD 250,000 annually under the liberalized remittance scheme (LRS). Investments above these thresholds require specific approval from the RBI.\n\nRupee Equivalent returns\n\nNote:", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Jamnadas Virji Advisory covering: .
