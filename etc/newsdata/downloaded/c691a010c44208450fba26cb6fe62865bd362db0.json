And you need to visit a food bank,\" writes Enright. (Food Depot Alimentaire/Facebook)\n\nWhere people step around you or over you and maybe drop a quarter into your Timmy's coffee cup.\n\nWhere you do your shopping in garbage cans and dumpsters.\n\nYou won't read or hear a lot during this election campaign because, it being an election campaign, it's indecorous to talk about poor people.\n\nI have heard the word poverty used once in the last two and a half weeks. That was on September 11, when the prime minister called the election.\n\nIt is not unusual. Poor people were blanked out in the 2015 election, and the silence was deafening.\n\nWhich is odd since there are nearly four million poor people in this country.\n\nThis includes 622,000 children.\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during an election campaign stop in Toronto on Sept. 20, 2019. \"I have heard the word poverty used once in the last two and a half weeks.

In major cities, Toronto leads with nearly 17 per cent of the population living in poverty.\n\nThe number of homeless has exploded since government cutbacks in social housing began in 1984.\n\nThe last federal election campaign and the current one have focused the attention of party leaders and candidates on the middle class.\n\nThe family is seen as the bulwark of the middle class, and that's where the votes are. Promises of tax cuts, increases in social programs, more child benefits \u2014 all aimed at the middle class. But defining the middle class and its members is difficult.\n\nIs membership based solely on wealth and income or does class play a role. Can you fall out of the middle class? Is there a board of regents or overseers that decides who is in and who is out?\n\nIt's much easier to describe the desperately poor.\n\nPoverty not surprisingly has its own culture. It has long existed and people come to terms with it. They cease to struggle against the obtrusively normal for the seemingly impossible. - John Kenneth Galbraith\n\nIn 1983 the great Canadian-born Keynesian economist, John Kenneth Galbraith, wrote a short book called The Voice of the Poor.\n\nIn it, he described how difficult it is to come to terms with the reality of the poor.\n\nHe wrote: \"Poverty not surprisingly has its own culture. It has long existed and people come to terms with it. They cease to struggle against the obtrusively normal for the seemingly impossible.\"\n\nThat's part of the problem \u2014 the poor adapt, they accommodate.\n\nThe reality is fairly straightforward. The poor are poor because they don't have money. The homeless are homeless because they don't have a place to live.\n\nChange those two things and you change people's lives. You change everything.\n\nClick 'listen' above to hear Michael's essay.", "description": "\u201cI have heard the word \u201cpoverty\u201d used once in the last two and a half weeks.
