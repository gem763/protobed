The treasurer-general [Leigh-Ann Mathys] voluntarily declined to contest because of many personal reasons. We concurred to the name from North West of Omphile Maotwe \u2013 she must be the treasurer-general.\u201d\n\nSedibe described Maotwe as a very competent member who had raised funds for the organisation when it was struggling.\n\n\u201cWe cannot work with people who procrastinate,\u201d Sedibe can be heard saying.\n\nSedibe said it was a given that Malema and deputy president Shivambu would retain their positions.\n\nHe said the position of the national chairperson would be given to MP Veronica Mente who would replace Dali Mpofu.\n\nThe position of the secretary-general is believed to be already set aside for Marshall Dlamini to replace Godrich Gardee.\n\n\n\nThe position of deputy secretary-general will be given to Poppy Mailola from Mpumalanga, who will replace Hlengiwe Hlophe.\n\n\n\nSedibe is also heard on the video conceding that this year\u2019s conference would be different in that the decisions made would be gender-friendly and there would be a gender balance in the party\u2019s leadership, compared with now when there are only two women and four males.\n\nThe proposed names would ensure a 50-50 balance.\n\n\u201cOn the secretary-general position, North West is bringing in the treasurer-general and then they said we can fit in either the national chairperson or the deputy secretary-general. Remember the principle is that there must be a gender balance, three out of three not like now when it\u2019s four out of two; we are fixing that now, we must take these matters seriously,\u201d Sedibe said.\n\nCity Press reported last week that Sedibe had said Mpofu should not be retained as national chairperson.\n\nHe said Mpofu had won a number of cases for ANC people in court, but was unable to do the same for EFF, because \u201cif he represented the EFF, it would be a conflict of interest\u201d.\n\n\n\nSedibe said that resulted in the EFF losing cases.\n\n\u201cFor example, the reason Supra Mahumapelo won a case in the North West is Dali [Mpofu]. The reason the faction of Senzo Mchunu won in KwaZulu-Natal is Dali. Free State is Dali. All the ANC battles it is Dali who won them. But by law he can\u2019t represent the EFF.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned this at a branch meeting, during a selection of delegates meeting in Mpumalanga.\n\nWe find it very ironic that our leaders will be left in high positions when they have a cloud of corruption hanging over them.\n\nCity Press has been reliably told that some EFF Mpumalanga members, including provincial legislature committee member Gcina Mofokeng, boycotted the branch meeting in which Sedibe was recorded because they disagreed with the leadership decisions being taken prior to the conference.\n\n\n\nWhen reached for comment Mofokeng declined, saying: \u201cI cannot comment because I am a nobody, try the spokesperson [Mbuyiseni Ndlozi] because I\u2019m not allowed to speak to the media.\u201d\n\nRead: EFF leader makes case for Dali Mpofu to quit as national chairperson\n\nParty members who spoke to City Press on condition of anonymity expressed disquiet that Malema and Shivambu would retain their positions despite being linked to scandals, such as the VBS Mutual Bank and Johannesburg fleet tender.\n\n\u201cWe find it very ironic that our leaders will be left in high positions when they have a cloud of corruption hanging over them.\n\n\u201cThere has to be new leadership introduced so we can move forward as a party. It would be better if we could have advocate Mpofu leading the party instead,\u201d they said.\n\nEFF spokesperson Ndlozi declined to comment on the leadership discussions.\n\n\u201cIt is against the EFF law to discuss leadership with and through the media.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to the published National Assembly guidelines, only delegates chosen in the branches are allowed to vote for positions.\n\n\u201cOnly voting delegates representing branches, regional, provincial and central command teams have the right to nominate and vote in National People\u2019s Assemblies,\u201d the guidelines read.\n\nIn addition the guidelines say: \u201cIn nominating for the CCT, 30% of the voting delegates in a National People\u2019s Assembly (NPA) should support the name/individual nominated for the name/individual to be included on ballot paper, and this should be determined by a show of hands and without announcing the results to the NPA.\u201d The guidelines confirm that the electoral commission will monitor the process and be responsible for counting the votes.\n\nTALK TO US What do you make of the impending changes to the leadership of the EFF?
