That\u2019s the highest in data going back to February 2017.\n\nThe U.S. move to impose Iran-related sanctions on Chinese companies including units of China COSCO Shipping Corp., one of the world\u2019s biggest vessel owners, is among the factors that propelled rates higher, according to shipping analysts. Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s shunning of vessels that have called at Venezuelan ports in the past 12 months also played a part.\n\nAdditional underlying drivers include seasonal market strength, hundreds of tankers getting fitted with \u201cscrubbers\u201d to meet International Maritime Organization sulfur-emissions rules that come into effect from January, and strengthening refining activity linked to that change.\n\n\u201cPresently the market is driven by psychology and sanctions, with few if any really knowing the duration of the latter,\u201d said Espen Fjermestad, an analyst at shipbroker Fearnley Securities AS in Oslo. \u201cIf anything, we see upside given greater supply reductions through scrubber retrofits and increased refinery runs ahead of IMO.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, tanker rates from the Middle East to China gained 11% to 133.13 Worldscale points, again the highest this year, the Baltic Exchange said. Worldscale is an industry standard that allows traders to easily calculate cash costs and returns from thousands of different tanker routes.\n\nExacerbating the sanctions-related reduction in ship supply, some vessels are installing scrubbers and that means \u201cthey will need to return to dry dock, effectively removing supply from the market,\u201d according to BloombergNEF oil analyst Mohith Velamala. About 700 tankers are scheduled to have installed scrubbers by the end of 2019, he said.\n\nOther major tanker routes also gained to year-to-date highs, including rates for the Middle East-to-Singapore and Middle East-to-U.S. Gulf journeys, as well as West Africa to China.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in years, all major shipping segments are trading at historical strong levels,\u201d Clarksons Platou Securities AS analysts including Frode Morkedal said in an emailed note earlier on Tuesday.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Firat Kayakiran in London at fkayakiran@bloomberg.net;John Deane in London at jdeane3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaric Nightingale at anightingal1@bloomberg.net, John Deane, Brian Wingfield\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Oil-tanker earnings surged above the $100,000-a-day marker on the benchmark route as a looming ship-fuel revolution combined with U.S. sanctions to supercharge rates.The rates for ships hauling 2-million-barrel cargoes of Middle East oil to China climbed more than 15% to $113,047-a-day", "authors": ["Firat Kayakiran", "John Deane"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vpQRv86DfYePyKKr.B1HPg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/ac1c86009d9e60909235180bcfb1d751", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
