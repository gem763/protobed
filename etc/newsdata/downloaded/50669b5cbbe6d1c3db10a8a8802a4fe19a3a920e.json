The Emmys celebrates the best in prime-time television, and there was no shortage of star-power at the annual event \u2014 nominees and presenters at this year's host-free show featured everyone from Kim Kadarshian to Michelle Williams to Amy Adams.\n\nFor the most part, the \"red carpet\" gowns yesterday were colourful and dreamy, if relatively uncomplicated; a few men went for a showier effect, but generally most embraced understated velvet tuxedos, or brown or black suiting for their carpet arrival.\n\nHere are 10 of my favourite Emmys-carpet looks.\n\nSandra Oh\n\n(Credit: Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCanadian actress Sandra Oh, who was again nominated for Lead Actress in a Drama, wore an off-the-shoulder gown by American designer Zac Posen in the perfect shade of pink. Fun fact: Oh's stylist, Elizabeth Saltzman, also works with her Killing Eve co-star Jodie Comer and Executive Producer Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\n\nMaisie Williams\n\n(Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\nGame of Thrones received an amazing 32 Emmy nominations this year, and actress Maisie Williams looked amazing in an elegant, modern black JW Anderson dress. British fashion designer Jonathan Anderson custom-designed the embellished dress to fit her petite, 5-foot frame in collaboration with Williams' boyfriend, designer Reuben Selby.\n\nTaraji P. Henson\n\n(Credit: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)\n\nTaraji P. Henson's pink-and-red caped gown was perfectly on-trend for this year (the combo was also worn by attendees Mandy Moore and Susan Kelechi Watson). The Empire star who, full disclosure, I got to work with years ago as a stylist's assistant, shone in the low-cut Vera Wang design. I love the wavy-textured, jaw-length graduated bob hairstyle created for Henson's carpet appearance by hairstylist Tym Wallace.\n\n\n\nMandy Moore\n\n(Credit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images)\n\nThe This Is Us star, who also recently released new music for the first time in almost a decade, wore a lovely, colour block gown in pink and red to the Emmys. The custom-made dress, by American designer Brandon Maxwell, features a dramatic off-the-shoulder neckline, high slit, and voluminous sleeves.\n\nKaramo Brown\n\n(Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\nDuring an Emmys pre-show interview, the Queer Eye and Dancing With The Stars talent mentioned that he wanted his Versace outfit to look like a tux\u2026 but distinctly different. This sleek black and white outfit, created in collaboration with a company called Kaftan Studio, looks particularly amazing in motion.\n\nLilly Singh\n\n(Credit: Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresenter \u2014 and Scarborough, Ontario native \u2014 Lilly Singh showed off her shoulder tattoo well with this emerald-green satin gown by Kimberly Parker (Zendaya and Michelle Williams also looked incredible in the trending shade). Singh's NBC late-night talk show, A Little Late with Lilly Singh, just debuted this month.\n\nCatherine O'Hara\n\n(Credit: Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCanadian actress Catherine O'Hara, nominated for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her work in CBC's Schitt's Creek, looked amazing in a custom black-and-white gown by Toronto label Greta Constantine. O'Hara also wore an Edie Parker clutch, and layered rings and bracelets from Canadian jeweller Birks.\n\nDan Levy\n\n(Credit: Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSchitt's Creek star Dan Levy looked dapper in a brown, double-breasted Prada tux and Cartier jewelry on the carpet last night. Several actors at this year's Emmys similarly opted to go with shades of brown and navy instead of basic black for their suiting this year.\n\nJulia Garner\n\n(Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\nJulia Garner, who won a Supporting Actress in a Drama Series award last night for her role on Ozark, wore a stunning, asymmetrical purple gown from Cong Tri's Spring/Summer 2020 collection. Garner's amber-toned, monochromatic beauty look was created by Canadian makeup artist Hung Vanngo, who used Chanel Beauty products.\n\nAnnie Murphy\n\n(Credit: Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCanadian actress Annie Murphy sparkled in a midnight-blue, sequin wrap dress. Her glamourous-yet-effortless beauty look was by an all-Canadian glam team: makeup artist Lucky Bromhead and hairstylist Ana Sorys.\n\nTruc Nguyen is a Toronto-based writer, editor and stylist.
