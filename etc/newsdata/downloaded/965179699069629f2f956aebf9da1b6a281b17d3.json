Sign up here.\n\nChinese buyers are back in the market for American soybeans after crushers in the Asian nation were granted a new round of tariff waivers, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nSoybean processors in China were granted permission to buy another 10 million metric tons of U.S. supplies without retaliatory duties, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. This would be a third round of waivers, with about 5 million tons granted previously.\n\nChinese buyers have bought at least three cargoes, or about 190,000 tons, as they seek supplies for late this year and early next, the people said. The bids mark a return to the American market after Chinese buyers recently picked up cargoes in Brazil, where prices have been more attractive to Asian crushers already hurt by slower feed demand due to the spread of African swine fever.\n\nChicago soybean futures traded at $9.51 a bushel on Wednesday after rising to $9.59 a day earlier, the highest intraday level in a week. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce didn\u2019t respond to a fax seeking comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said China has indicated that negotiations over an initial trade deal are advancing, raising expectations that the two sides could sign an agreement at a meeting next month in Chile. A phase-one accord represents a pause in the 18-month trade war that has hurt the world\u2019s largest economies.\n\n\u201cThey have started the buying,\u201d Trump said Monday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, referring to Chinese purchases of U.S. agriculture products that the president has pushed for as part of a deal. \u201cI want more.\u201d\n\nWaivers were issued to state-owned and private crushers as well as multinational processors based in China, the people said. While some traders remained optimistic about the sales, others pointed to lower prices in Brazil.\n\n\u201cChina will buy where the cheapest price is,\u201d said Joe Davis, a director at brokerage Futures International in Chicago. \u201cThey have plenty of time on the new tariff-free waivers so I would not expect it all at once in the U.S. with the market at the highest levels since mid-June. These private buyers will wait to see if prices fall.\u201d\n\n(Updates with China buying 3 cargoes in third paragraph.)\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Niu Shuping in Beijing at nshuping@bloomberg.net;Alfred Cang in Singapore at acang@bloomberg.net;Isis Almeida in Chicago at ialmeida3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tina Davis at tinadavis@bloomberg.net, James Poole\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
