There was no higher you could climb without more black voters. Mmusi Maimane knew that and needed to do what had to be done to get it. Did you make him leader as a fa\u00e7ade or did you really want him to grow the vote in black communities? Communities who were slowly starting to believe that the DA might just be that party for all, that could actually deliver \u2013 something they were also starting to see and believe the ANC cannot do.\n\nSo you lost a few hundred thousand right wing voters to the FF+ in the last election ... so what? Good riddance! That was giving you the credit to grow the black vote going forward \u2013 on a plate. You needed to play on that, in order to convince even more black voters that you are not a white party, but a centre party for all. Your chances of growing in that area never looked better \u2013 if you handled it right.\n\nInstead, you would prefer to lose your credit among black people in order to win those white voters back - why? Now you have chased most of your black voters back to the ANC or to the EFF \u2013 well done!\n\nNever mind shooting yourself in the foot \u2013 you just shot yourself in the head. I predict that you will lose even more votes in the next election, than you lost in the last. You've certainly lost mine.\n\nSean Beukes\n\nRoseban", "description": "So you lost a few hundred thousand right wing voters to the FF+ in the last election ... so what?
