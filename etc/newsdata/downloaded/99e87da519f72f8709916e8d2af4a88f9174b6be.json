The latest data directly counter the government's claim that the job market is improving.\n\nTemporary workers accounted for 33 percent of the total workforce, the highest since August 2012 when the figure was 33.2 percent. The proportion of temps fell to 32.2 percent in 2014 but has since been on the rise. Since its inauguration in May 2017, the Moon Jae-in government has vowed to turn temporary jobs into regular ones, but it seems to be having little success.\n\nThe gap in benefits for temporary and permanent workers has also widened. Permanent workers' average wage rose 5.5 percent over the past three months on-year to W3 million, while temporary workers saw a mere 4.8 percent increase to W1.57 million, making 54.6 percent of what permanent staff earn, down from 55 percent last year.\n\nThe difference in the two groups' average duration of employment also grew by a month to five years and two months.", "description": "Temporary Workforce Swells as Regular Jobs Dry up", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2018/10/31/2018103101459_0.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-31"}
