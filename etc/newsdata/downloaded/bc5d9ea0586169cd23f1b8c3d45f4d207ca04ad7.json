Moviegoers arriving at crowded premieres can expect to have their bags searched or to be monitored by armed guards. After passing through metal detectors, attendees at outdoor food festivals can anticipate surveillance by police on motorcycles or horseback, patrolling security barriers on the perimeters of the grounds. It isn\u2019t that the safety precautions aren\u2019t welcome, but rather that they come at a cost. They\u2019re the scars left by prior shootings and a tangible memento mori. Death stalks grocery-store aisles and elementary school corridors, and it\u2019s possible to remember a time when it didn\u2019t.\n\nBut that time is ending. Each mass shooting forecloses the innocence of another place, another time, another activity. The majority of teenagers and their parents already worry about school shootings; as more settings become venues for mass violence, the fear will only spread, bringing its visible signals with it. Gun deaths belong in some sense to the lawmakers who are charged with the responsibility to care for the public but fail to meet their obligations, and so, too, does the darkening of American life, and all the liberty and happiness that terror cloaks in shadow.", "description": "", "authors": ["Elizabeth Bruenig", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Lawmakers-Who-Refuse-To-Address-Gun-Violence-Are-Darkening-American-Life"], "top_image": ""}
