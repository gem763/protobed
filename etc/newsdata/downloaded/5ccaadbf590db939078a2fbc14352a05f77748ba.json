The announcement led Jim Mattis to resign as defense secretary and then-national security adviser John Bolton to take steps attempting to protect the Kurds.\n\nTrump\u2019s new decision to abandon the Kurds has already sparked backlash beyond Fox News. A Syria Kurdish official told NBC that \u201cthe Americans are traitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have abandoned us to a Turkish massacre. We can no longer fight against ISIS and have to defend ourselves. This could allow ISIS to return to the region,\u201d the official said.\n\nAlso on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Trump\u2019s decision compromises America\u2019s promise to allies.\n\n\u201cThe thing I believe is if you make a commitment and someone is fighting with you, America should keep its word,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nSen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) also called into the show to say that Trump\u2019s \u201cimpulsive\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d decision to abandon the Kurds has \u201cundone all the gains we\u2019ve made\u201d and \u201cthrown the region into further chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m an ISIS fighter, I\u2019ve got a second lease on life,\u201d said Graham, normally one of the president\u2019s most vigorous defenders. \u201cTo those who think ISIS has been defeated, you will soon see.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI like President Trump. I\u2019ve tried to help him. This to me is just unnerving to its core. To say to the American people, \u2019ISIS has been destroyed in Syria\u2019 is not true.\u201d", "description": "Co-host Brian Kilmeade, joined by Sen.
