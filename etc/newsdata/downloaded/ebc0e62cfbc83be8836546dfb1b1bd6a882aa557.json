Citi to Slash Foreign-Exchange Platforms by Two Thirds, FT Says\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: ) plans to cut the number of foreign-exchange platforms it supports by two thirds, the Financial Times reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe multinational investment bank wants to reduce the number of platforms used to connect with customers to 15 from 45 by the first quarter of 2020, the newspaper said. Citigroup (NYSE: ) has sent a survey to all the providers, the FT said.\n\nThe move may save Citi $5 million to $10 million a year from cutting links to third-party platforms that offer competing bids from other banks, the newspaper reported. Citigroup (NYSE: ) spokeswoman Shirley Lam declined to comment to queries from Bloomberg.\n\nCitigroup (NYSE: ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co. are the two biggest foreign-exchange traders by market share due to their technology and client networks, according to a 2018 study by Greenwich Associates. With currency volatility having slumped over the past decade, banks have invested heavily in electronic trading to reduce costs.\n\n\u201cFor every connection you make, you need connectivity to make sure the latency of pricing isn\u2019t hampered,\u201d said Wong Joo Seng, chief executive officer of Singapore-based currency platform provider Spark Systems Pte. \u201cThe banks, I think, will have to rationalize the number of platforms they\u2019re plugged into. FX isn\u2019t really a growing pie after all.\u201d\n\nCurrency trading platforms are provided by companies including Saxo Bank and CMC Markets Plc. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, operates FXGO.\n\n\u201cYou may see other providers following, especially when the big FX players aren\u2019t making much money in FX any more,\u201d said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based director and co-founder of X-Chainge, which provides foreign exchange-related technologies.", "description": "Citi to Slash Foreign-Exchange Platforms by Two Thirds, FT Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA610UH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
