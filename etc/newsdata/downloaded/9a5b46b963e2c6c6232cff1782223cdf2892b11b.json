Lindsey Graham on Monday denounced President Donald Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria as Turkey prepares a military assault against Kurdish fighters who helped the U.S. battle the Islamic State.\n\nGraham phoned into \"Fox & Friends,\" which Trump is known to watch regularly, to express his displeasure at the \"impulsive decision by the president,\" calling it \"short-sighted and irresponsible.\" He said the move has \"undone all the gains we've made\" and \"thrown the region into further chaos.\"\n\n\"This to me is just unnerving to its core,\" Graham said.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters, America's chief ally in battling Islamic State terrorists in Syria, said in a statement that their U.S. allies \"did not fulfill their obligations,\" as U.S. troops began to withdraw from their positions ahead of the expected Turkish military assault.\n\n'A reckless gamble': Four reasons critics decry Trump's 'impulsive' Syria withdrawal\n\nMore: On Syria, Donald Trump cites 'my great and unmatched wisdom' \u2013 others say no way\n\n\"A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in a statement.\n\n\"As we learned the hard way during the Obama Administration, American interests are best served by American leadership, not by retreat or withdrawal,\" McConnell said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and other administration officials had promised the U.S. would ensure that \"the Turks don't slaughter the Kurds.\" The Kurdish fighters in Syria are known as the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan considers the Kurdish forces in Syria to be terrorists allied with Kurdish insurgents within his country and has long threatened a military incursion into the area.\n\nA members of the Kurdish Internal Security Police Force of Asayesh stands guard as Syrian Kurds demonstrate against Turkish threats to launch a military operation on their region, in the town of Al-Qahtaniyah, in northeastern Syrian Al-Hasakah Governorate on Oct. 7, 2019. - More\n\nForeign policy experts, as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers, have warned that allowing Turkey into the region could lead to a massacre of the Kurds and would be seen as an American betrayal of a vital military ally.\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended the move on Twitter Monday, writing the U.S. \"was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days\" and \"that was many years ago.\"\n\n\"We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n\"The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,\" Trump added. He repeated his aversion to long-term U.S. military commitments overseas and said, \"WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\"\n\n\"Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out,\" he added.\n\nIn a later tweet, Trump threatened to \"destroy\" Turkey's economy if it does something he considers \"off limits.\"\n\n\"As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\" the president tweeted.\n\nGraham said he and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., planned to introduce bipartisan sanctions on Turkey if they invade Syria and to call for Turkey's suspension from NATO if they attack the Kurds. He said he hoped the legislation would have a veto-proof majority.", "description": "\"The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,\" Trump said as Turkey prepares an assault in the region.", "authors": ["William Cummings", "David Jackson", "Deirdre Shesgreen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rgvT129XNTgmE8.VVgYUbQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/5df749d79ed5300e76558b471e4584ec", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
