Lower emissions Higher emissions These findings come from a New York Times analysis of new data released through Boston University\u2019s Database of Road Transportation Emissions. The database provides the most detailed estimates available of local on-road CO 2 over the past three decades. The map above shows emissions in 2017.\n\nEven as the United States has reduced carbon dioxide emissions from its electric grid, largely by switching from coal power to less-polluting natural gas, emissions from transportation have remained stubbornly high.\n\nThe bulk of those emissions, nearly 60 percent, come from the country\u2019s 250 million passenger cars, S.U.V.s and pickup trucks, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Freight trucks contribute an additional 23 percent.\n\nIn 2017, transportation was the top source of greenhouse gases.

Emissions dipped during the recession of the late 2000s, but have been ticking back up since 2013.\n\nNational fuel economy standards put in place under the Obama administration have helped temper the rise in automotive emissions because the rules require cars and trucks to use less gasoline per mile traveled. But even as vehicles have become more efficient, Americans, buoyed by a strong economy and low gas prices, have been driving more miles and buying more S.U.V.s and pickup trucks, which have lower gas mileage. Freight trucking is also on the rise.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to finalize a rollback of efficiency standards for passenger vehicles this month, a move that could significantly increase future emissions from America\u2019s cars and trucks.\n\nEmissions From Driving Have Grown Fastest in America\u2019s Cities and Suburbs\n\nBoston University\u2019s emissions database, first published in 2015 and updated this week with an additional five years of data, reveals that much of the increase in driving-related CO 2 has occurred in and around cities.\n\nSuburban driving, including commuting, has been a major contributor to the expanding carbon footprint of urban areas, Dr. Gately said.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cEven in the densest cities, the vast majority of trips still happen in a motor vehicle.\u201d These trips include work commutes, school drop-offs and millions of other daily errands as well as freight deliveries and other business traffic, each of which contribute to planetary warming.\n\nThe New York Times identified the 100 metropolitan areas with the highest total emissions from driving, based on Boston University\u2019s local estimates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn nearly every metro area, total emissions have increased since 1990. Here\u2019s the trend line for the area you selected in the top map. The New York area, home to 20 million Americans, accounted for the largest share of driving-related CO 2 . After years of increase, emissions ebbed during the late-2000s recession but rebounded by 2017. In more car-dependent areas, like Dallas-Fort Worth, emissions from driving barely dipped during the recession and have increased rapidly in recent years. But, adjusted for population, these cities flip: Residents in the denser, more transit-friendly New York area contribute far less CO 2 from driving on average than their counterparts in Dallas. Per capita emissions have also ticked up in most metro areas in recent years. Here\u2019s the per person trend for your selected area.\n\nMeaningfully lowering emissions from driving requires both technological and behavioral change, said Deb Niemeier, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Maryland. Fundamentally, you need to make vehicles pollute less, make people drive less, or both, she said.\n\nCities and states have sought to green the vehicles on their roads by providing tax incentives for electric and hybrid models, and by building more charging stations. California has the unique authority to set its own pollution standards for cars and trucks that are stricter than national rules, but the Trump administration is challenging this power.\n\nCities have also tried to reduce the amount people drive by encouraging carpooling, expanding transit options \u2014 including subways, light rail and rapid bus services \u2014 and planning denser, more accessible neighborhoods, too. In 2021, New York will become the first city in America to charge drivers a fee for entering highly congested areas.\n\nIn the absence of federal leadership, such local and regional initiatives have taken on new urgency.\n\n\u201cEvery city has some workable strategies to lower vehicle related greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d Dr. Niemeier said, but the right mix depends on local conditions, including existing development patterns and infrastructure. \u201cWhat works in New York City will not work in Dallas-Fort Worth,\u201d she said.\n\nNo matter the mechanism, Dr. Gately of Boston University said, \u201cBig, long-term change needs to happen in America\u2019s cities.\u201d", "description": "See driving-related emissions in your metro area, road by road.", "authors": ["Nadja Popovich", "Denise Lu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/us/road-emissions-map-promo-1570662833298/road-emissions-map-promo-1570662833298-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
