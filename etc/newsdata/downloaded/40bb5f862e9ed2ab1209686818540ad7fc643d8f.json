I am proud to have helped develop this amendment and to co-sponsor it in committee.\u201d\n\nWhen a journalist observed that McConnell had made the reversal \u201cunder fire,\u201d McConnell\u2019s communications director, David Popp, replied on Twitter: \u201cHe\u2019s not under fire from anyone. He pounced at the opportunity to seize the moment and help secure this important funding.\u201d\n\nRight. Like a drowning man pounces on a life raft.\n\nIn August 2018, McConnell led the Senate GOP in blocking a proposal to spend $250 million on election security \u2014 the same amount he\u2019s now \u201cproud\u201d to support. In July, he was still resistant to further legislation, claiming the \u201cabsence\u201d of election problems.\n\nThe amount McConnell finally allowed, even combined with the $380 million approved in early 2018, is a fraction of the more than $2 billion needed. McConnell also continues to block related efforts to fortify U.S. defenses, such as requiring paper-ballot backup, post-election audits and campaigns to tell the FBI about offers of foreign assistance.\n\nStill, after exhausting all other possibilities, he finally did the right thing. He did it because he was forced.\n\nThere is a lesson in this for Democrats and others seeking to counter the worst abuses of the Trump age. McConnell may leap to appease President Trump, but ultimately he will succumb to political pressure. McConnell speaks one language: cold, ruthless power.\n\nDemocrats should keep that in mind as they try to get action in the Senate on gun safety and other proposals. McConnell is, by reputation, a legislative mastermind, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) have beaten him several times by putting pressure on him.\n\nOn the matter of hurricane-recovery funding for devastated Puerto Rico, for example, McConnell did his utmost to honor Trump\u2019s wishes that the U.S. territory, a frequent target of the president\u2019s hostility, not receive additional funding this year. In March, McConnell used procedural steps to block amendments to a massive disaster aid bill, thereby preventing Puerto Rico aid from being added.\n\nDemocrats responded in the only way that would get McConnell\u2019s attention: They stuck together and blocked the overall $13.5 billion disaster-aid bill, leaving the Senate without a way to deal with hurricane damage to the mainland United States, Midwest floods and California wildfires. By May, McConnell had relented, and the overall relief package, with $900 million for Puerto Rico, sailed through the Senate.\n\nLegislation providing funds to care for 9/11 victims followed a similar pattern. McConnell had long been the main obstacle to providing help for stricken first responders. In late 2015, a bipartisan agreement on renewing the program was ready to go when McConnell rejected it, leaving the deal \u201cin tatters,\u201d The Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis reported at the time. Under pressure from comedian Jon Stewart and others, McConnell eventually accepted a temporary renewal.\n\nThis year, with the program again expiring, advocates again tried for a permanent renewal \u2014 and McConnell, again, declined to commit to action, apparently seeking to do some horse trading. But under enormous pressure from Stewart, 9/11 heroes and Democrats, McConnell in June relented and allowed a permanent renewal to be enacted.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s behavior on Trump\u2019s border wall fits the pattern, too. Schumer and Pelosi late last year offered $1.3 billion for border security, but McConnell, trying to honor Trump\u2019s demand for $5 billion for a border wall, indicated he would only go along with what the president wanted. Against McConnell\u2019s wishes, Trump invited a 34-day government shutdown over the matter. Republicans faced intense pressure to end the shutdown, and in the end, McConnell and his fellow Republicans agreed to something much like the Democrats\u2019 original offer.\n\nNow, we see it again on election security. In July, McConnell called election-security legislation a \u201cTrojan horse for partisan wish-list items that would not actually make our elections safer.\u201d Now he\u2019s \u201cproud\u201d to beef up election security. He didn\u2019t see the light or yield to persuasion. He was bulldozed.
