Trudeau, for his part, will focus almost exclusively on Andrew Scheer (Conservative Party) as his main opponent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaxime Bernier vs. Andrew Scheer Scheer and Maxime Bernier (People\u2019s Party of Canada) will tussle for right-wing hearts and minds. Jagmeet Singh (New Democratic Party) and Elizabeth May (Green Party) will square off against each other about who\u2019s the best progressive alternative to Trudeau.\n\nWhat does each candidate need to accomplish during the debate?\n\nJustin Trudeau His top priority will be keeping progressive voters on his side, despite his track record on oil pipelines, blackface and an ongoing corruption scandal. He could raise fears that voting for more left-leaning candidates could allow Scheer and Conservatives to seize the keys to government.\n\nHe will also push Scheer on environment, abortion rights, gun control, and marriage equality to cast himself as the more progressive choice of the two leading parties.\n\nAndrew Scheer He will focus on pocketbook issues and on presenting himself as Mr. Clean compared with Trudeau. Scheer will need to appeal to moderate suburban voters not yet convinced of his party\u2019s governing style.\n\nScheer will also have to figure out how to neutralize Bernier. Scheer defeated Bernier for leadership of the Conservative party in 2017, prompting Bernier to create a splinter party that now polls at 3 percent. Every vote for Bernier is a potential lost vote for Scheer, who can\u2019t afford to lose any votes if he\u2019s to overtake the Liberal Party.\n\nYves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet As leader of Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, he is the debate\u2019s wild card. He has no interest in being prime minister of Canada, and doesn\u2019t even want to be Canadian. His goal is Quebec independence.\n\nHis party has one mission: to send MPs to Ottawa and lobby constantly for more powers and more funding for the majority French-speaking province. Expect fireworks, including an effort to read out a list of demands from the premier of Quebec.\n\nJagmeet Singh He may be the first party leader from a visible minority, but don\u2019t expect him to spend much time on racial issues like Trudeau\u2019s blackface scandal or Quebec\u2019s Bill 21, which bans government employees from wearing religious headwear to work. Singh\u2019s party has suffered in opinion polls this year and he needs to appeal to a broad base to change that momentum.\n\nElizabeth May She didn\u2019t get an invite to a French-language debate that took place last Wednesday, so this will be her first chance on a national stage to convince voters that a minority government is Canada\u2019s best bet: a fact that would make her Green Party a convenient coalition partner to either the Liberals or Conservatives.\n\nWhich audience matters most?\n\nWhile Quebec\u2019s six million voters have handed victory to a different party in each of the last three federal elections (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in 2008, NDP in 2011, and Liberals in 2015), many will be waiting to tune into Thursday\u2019s French debate and won\u2019t be watching Monday. That means suburban moderates, particularly in Ontario, are the biggest swing constituency to reach.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/02/b8/9db46fde40738707e4f4827d8d83/lede.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
