Coach Todd Reirden said some of their new players weren\u2019t chosen \u201cby accident.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you can look to see. Some guys that aren\u2019t necessarily all that fun to play against,\u201d Reirden said Thursday at the team\u2019s media day.\n\nAfter adding some tough players over the summer, the Capitals enter the 2019-20 season facing a tough reality: Several of their best players are 30 or older, two key cogs are in the last year of their contracts and their window to win a second Stanley Cup won\u2019t be open forever.\n\n\u201cWe tried to keep the majority of our core guys after having won the Stanley Cup, but this is different now,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cWe\u2019re turning the page on that and we\u2019ve got something that we want to go after again and we feel we can compete for, and that\u2019s another Stanley Cup.\n\n\u201cI think that with those (new) players, what you\u2019re going to see is you\u2019re going to see players that \u2014 much like I talked about the style of play \u2014 they\u2019re aggressive, skating, physical.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals traded defenseman Matt Niskanen to the Philadelphia Flyers for defenseman Radko Gudas last summer, but essentially Gudas was brought in to replace Brooks Orpik, who retired and now will work in the organization\u2019s player development department. The hope is that Gudas will fit Orpik\u2019s mold of a physical \u201cdefensive defenseman\u201d \u2014 though it\u2019s a concern that the 29-year-old has been suspended four times in the past four seasons and could incur a long ban if he hits someone the wrong way.\n\nThere\u2019s also the retooling of the third and fourth lines, which could not match the production of the Carolina Hurricanes\u2019 bottom lines in Washington\u2019s first-round series loss last April. Wingers Richard Panik, Brendan Leipsic and Garnet Hathaway signed with Washington in free agency, and Reirden believes they will add some aggressiveness to the forward group\u2019s identity.\n\nIt\u2019s welcome news to bruising top-line right wing Tom Wilson.\n\n\u201cFine by me,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI think you always want a team that\u2019s hard to play against first and foremost. When a team comes into your rink you want them to know it\u2019s going to be a tough game. You want to have that identity a little bit. We\u2019ve been a team over the years that we could play a variety of games and that\u2019s important. I think we added some weight.\u201d\n\nDefenseman John Carlson said being tough to play against can mean one of two things.\n\n\u201cIt can mean physical or it can just mean in-your-face with a little more attacking,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that can do the same thing as running people over like some guys can do \u2026 I don\u2019t know where we would rank in terms of size, but we seem to be one of the bigger teams and we\u2019ve got to use it to our advantage and we\u2019ve got guys who can skate as well. So, if you\u2019re not running guys over to be aggressive, getting in peoples\u2019 faces a little more can have the same effect sometimes.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals will face stiff competition in the division this year, not only from familiar suspects like the Hurricanes and Pittsburgh Penguins, but also from the new-look New Jersey Devils, who figure to bounce back with the additions of P.K. Subban and No. 1 overall draft pick Jack Hughes.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington\u2019s time at the top might be running short. ESPN and The Athletic both recently ranked every NHL team\u2019s farm system, and both pegged Washington\u2019s group of prospects in the bottom five. And with goalie Braden Holtby and center Nicklas Backstrom not under contract beyond 2020, it\u2019s hard to predict what future Capitals teams could look like.\n\nGeneral manager Brian MacLellan and the Capitals\u2018 front office have met with Holtby\u2019s camp to discuss a new contract, but not with Backstrom\u2019s yet.\n\n\u201cI still feel like we\u2019re the same core group here, we\u2019re pretty confident that we can do it again and we believe in ourselves and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do,\u201d Backstrom said. \u201cI think, too, that you can\u2019t look too much ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil something happens there\u2019s no use expending your energy on it, worrying about stuff like that,\u201d Holtby said. \u201cI\u2019m in a great city here with a great team right now so I might as well enjoy it and create something special.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
