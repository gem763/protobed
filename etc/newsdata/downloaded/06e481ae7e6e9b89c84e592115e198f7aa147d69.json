The move is the latest in a trend of central banks lowering rates to boost local economies.\n\nIn addition, smaller banks have also handed down rate cuts. Turkey's central bank also surprised with a jumbo rate cut early Thursday before saying that it will begin to slow its pace of monetary easing going forward. Later in the day, Denmark also cut its interest rate to a historical low, following in the ECB's footsteps, Bloomberg reported.\n\nRead more: 'Being boiled like frogs': A Wall Street investment chief unloads on how the Fed's behavior is actually hurting the middle class it's supposed to be helping\n\nHowever, not every central bank has handed down a rate cut this month. Earlier in September, Australia's central bank held interest rates at a low 1%, and Canada's held its rates at 1.75%.\n\nBut going forward, there are likely more cuts from major central banks on the horizon. After the ECB decision, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve, which meets September 18. Most investors think that the Fed will cut rates, but it remains to be seen by how much. President Trump has stepped up his bashing of the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell, saying they should cut faster.\n\nTrump has even gone as far to say that the US should have zero or negative interest rates, following in the footsteps of countries in Europe and Japan that have had very low and even negative rates for years.\n\nHere are the seven central banks that have yet to meet in September, as well as what markets and investors expect them to do at upcoming meetings:", "description": "The European Central Bank announced rate cuts and    stimulus for the eurozone on Thursday.
