For her role as a judge on this season of America\u2019s Got Talent, the actress and dancer has been toying with her blonde hair \u2014 stepping out with stage light-bright platinum highlights and long extensions styled in a slick ponytail.\n\nEvery switch-up throughout the season made for a glam moment on the red carpet, a stylized complement to Hough\u2019s sequin designer gown of choice. But at the AGT finale, which aired this week, Hough shocked us all when she debuted her best \u2014 not to mention permanent \u2014 hairstyle to date: A fresh, blunt, chin-skimming bob.\n\nFrom her past appearances, we know that Hough\u2019s hair was previously a true lob length, the ends hovering around her shoulders, even when styled with a flat-iron bends. Now polished and straight, the star\u2019s ends stop a clear two inches above her shoulders, which is to say, she\u2019s had a run-in with the scissors.\n\nView photos HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA \u2013 SEPTEMBER 17: Julianne Hough attends \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d Season 14 Live Show Red Carpet at Dolby Theatre on September 17, 2019 in Hollywood, California.

But she did tap hairstylist Jill Buck, out of L.A.\u2019s Nine Zero One Salon, to help her style her glittering grande finale look \u2014 proving it\u2019s always best to go out with a bang (or a bob).\n\nLike what you see?
