(Image: Hasbro, Funko, Mattel)\n\nThis Friday is perhaps the most important date in a Star Wars fan\u2019s calendar this year outside, of, well, you know... December 19, 2019. Because who wants to just see a new Star Wars movie when you can buy all the toys from it months in advance, too? That\u2019s what you\u2019ll be doing for \u201cTriple Force Friday\u201d on October 4 \u2014 and here are all the toys that could be bankrupting you.\n\nThe extremely awkward name this time around isn\u2019t just because it\u2019s the third \u201cForce Friday\u201d event Disney has put on \u2014 similar events happened for the toys for Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi, as well as ones for Rogue One and Solo that somehow officially don\u2019t count as a sanctioned \u201cForce Fridays,\u201d a concept we now must all attempt to comprehend.\n\nBut it\u2019s also named as much for the fact that this year, the focus is on three new Star Wars projects: The Rise of Skywalker, of course, but also the upcoming Disney+ streaming show The Mandalorian, set to begin mid-November, and the new Star Wars video game from EA and Respawn, Jedi: Fallen Order, due out November 15.\n\nAll this really means is that while we\u2019re getting a bunch of toys based on the new movie, we\u2019re also just getting a bunch of Star Wars toy goodness in general. You really do need an entire week to plan! Luckily for you, we've got the lowdown. Some of these were revealed as part of yesterday\u2019s teaser-y livestream event, but here\u2019s everything you\u2019ll be able to find on store shelves starting next week. We\u2019ve broken it down by the Star Wars adventure they\u2019re inspired by.\n\nEditor's Note: Force Fridays are usually pretty well supported by local pop culture shops in Australia, but it's not always guaranteed that we'll get everything listed below. If there's something you have your eye on that doesn't end up coming our way, it's best to keep an eye on eBay before prices skyrocket.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\n\n6\" Black Series Action Figures\n\nHasbro\u2019s 6\"-scaled line of articulated figures (Around $30) will be celebrating The Rise of Skywalker in style. Kylo Ren, Rey (bundled with a little D-O figure!), the Sith Trooper \u2014 similar to the one released early at Comic-Con this year \u2014 and a First Order Stormtrooper with Riot Gear will lead the charge, joined later this year by figures of Naomi Ackie\u2019s mysterious new character Jannah, and a First Order Snowtrooper.\n\nSpeaking of exclusives, Hasbro will also offer these same figures in exclusive, white \u201cPremiere\u201d packaging at stores for a limited time on Force Friday itself, as well in the standard Black Series boxes. But beyond that, there are also four exclusive re-painted figures in what\u2019s being called the \u201cCarbonized Collection\u201d (Around $37 each), giving shiny paint jobs and shiny packaging to a select few toys.\n\nFunko Pop! Vinyls and Mystery Minis\n\nSurprise! Funko, masters of putting out toys for basically everything under the sun, are putting out The Rise of Skywalker toys. There is a frankly stunning amount of Pops ($19 each) on the way for the film, including \u2014 deep breath! \u2014 Rey, Kylo Ren, Finn, Poe Dameron, Rose Tico, D-O, BB-8, Jannah, Lando Calrissian, Sith Troopers, Sith Jet Troopers, normal Jet Troopers, Lieutenant Connix and Zorii Bliss \u2014 Keri Russell\u2019s mysterious character, with connections to Poe\u2019s past. Phew!\n\nMeanwhile, want something more elaborate? Two \u201cMovie Moments\u201d deluxe Pops will be available too (Prices TBA, but likely around the $50 mark) \u2014 Kylo Ren in his hilariously named TIE Whisper, and a First Order Treadspeeder, featuring both a Stormtrooper and a Jet Trooper.\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer something less bobble-headed, Funko\u2019s blind-box Myster Minis figurines ($10 each) will also be launching a Rise of Skywalker wave, featuring Knights of Ren and Sith Jet Troopers, alongside major characters like Poe, Finn, Rey, Kylo Ren and Lando.\n\n3.75\" The Vintage Collection Action Figures\n\nIt\u2019s not Star Wars toys without a 3.75\" range, and the fan-favourite Vintage Collection (Around $20 each) is giving collectors the same highly-articulated action figures at this smaller scale. The Rise of Skywalker wave will include new figures of Rey, Kylo Ren, Poe Dameron, the Sith Jet Trooper, one of the Knights of Ren and Zorii Bliss. From the wider Star Wars galaxy, they\u2019ll be joined by a new version of Luke Skywalker in his X-Wing pilot gear.\n\nThe Vintage Collection Vehicles\n\nAnd you\u2019ll need that Luke figure, because he\u2019s getting his very own X-Wing (Around $150) to fly around in! Scaled to the Vintage Collection figures, the ship has retractable landing gear, an opening cockpit, adjustable S-Foils to pose in attack and flight positions, and a mini projectile launcher.\n\nNot to be outdone by this piloting hero, Poe will also be joining in on the vehicular action with his brand new X-Wing from The Rise of Skywalker (Also around $150). Replacing Black One, destroyed in The Last Jedi, the new fighter has an orange-and-white colour scheme, the X-Wing has posable S-Foils, an opening canopy, and even a little ladder accessory for Poe to climb aboard with.\n\nLego\n\nLego will release five sets based on The Rise of Skywalker, covering a variety of familiar and new vehicles. Based on the Treadspeeder chase we\u2019ve seen in the trailers, the Pasaana Speeder Chase (Around $60) comes in at 373 pieces, and comes with the parts to build both a First Order Treadspeeder and a transport for said Treadspeeder to chase, as well as three minifigures \u2014 Rey, a Treadspeeder Driver, and a Jet Trooper \u2014 as well as a small buildable BB-8.\n\nUp in the skies, meanwhile, are two new sets based on the Resistance versions of some classic Star Wars ships appearing in the film. First up is a 269-piece green Resistance A-Wing (Around $45) that comes with minifigures of Snap Wexley and Lieutenant Connix, and then a Resistance Y-Wing (Around $105), a 578-piece set that includes Poe Dameron, Zorii Bliss, a First Order Snowtrooper, D-0, and an unnamed but delightfully-coloured R5 astromech unit.\n\nOn the side of evil is an updated version of Kylo Ren\u2019s shuttle from The Force Awakens (Around $175). The all-new, 1,005-piece set features an updated colour scheme, rotating and collapsing wings to pose the ship in flight or ready to land, spring-loaded shooters, and six sinister minifigures: Kylo, two mysterious Knights of Ren, General Pryde, a First Order Stormtrooper and a Sith Trooper.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a Lego Force Friday without a Millennium Falcon \u2014 both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi got takes on the iconic ship, and while it\u2019s not quite as swanky as the wildly expensive Ultimate Collectors Series version of this Lego hunk of junk, the Rise of Skywalker Falcon set (Around $240) clocks in at a meagre 1351 pieces in comparison.\n\nFeaturing rotating top-and-underside guns as well as a detailed interior, this version of the Falcon comes with a wide set of minifigures reflecting the ship\u2019s crew in The Rise of Skywalker: Finn, a mysterious new alien called Boolio, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, D-O, and a certain suave individual by the name of Lando Calrissian. He\u2019s not a system, he\u2019s a man!\n\nLastly, two sets from the wider Saga will also join these Rise of Skywalker playsets. From A New Hope, the 159-piece Death Star Cannon (Around $30) comes with Obi-Wan Kenobi and a Death Star Gunner, replicating the scene where Obi-Wan sneaks through the innards of the battle station to disable its tractor beam. On a larger scale is the 1,771-piece replica of Yoda (Around $150) \u2014 based on his appearance in the prequel movies rather than the older, more mystical Jedi Master of Empire Strikes Back, this Yoda has posable eyebrows, hands and a swivelling head, and even comes with a minifigure-sized version of himself for comparison!\n\n5\" Star Wars: Galaxy of Adventures Action Figures and Vehicles\n\nSomething entirely different for Force Friday this year is a new scale range from Hasbro: 5\" stylised action figures loosely inspired by the aesthetic of the Galaxy of Adventures animated shorts. Unlike their Black Series and Vintage Collection counterparts, these figures (Around $15 each) will not just be articulated, but also feature action features, like slashing arms and quick-draw blaster actions. From Rise there\u2019s Rey, Kylo Ren, Finn and a First Order Jet Trooper, alongside more general Star Wars stalwarts Darth Vader and Chewbacca.\n\nThere will also be two multipacks (Around $22 each) in the line as well. One features Rey and an unmasked Kylo Ren, the other is a trio of droids in the form of R2-D2, BB-8, and Rise of Skywalker newcomer D-O. Rounding out the Galaxy of Adventures figures is actually a vehicle set: the First Order Treadspeeder (Around $37). Coming with a normal First Order Stormtrooper figure, the speeder has a launchable projector and \u201cexciting crash effects.\u201d Because what else do you expect a Stormtrooper on a speeder to do than crash it?\n\nHot Wheels Character Cars\n\nHot Wheel\u2019s zany line of \u201cwhat if Star Wars characters drove cars that look like car versions of themselves?\u201d line of 1:64 scale vehicles (Around $6 each) will celebrate The Rise of Skywalker with two new vehicles in the form of D-O the droid and Kylo Ren\u2019s cracked helmet. Meanwhile in the 1:43rd scale is a slightly larger ATV (Around $12) based on Rey\u2019s scavenger look from Jakku.\n\nSkywalker Saga Commemorative Edition Two-Packs\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker marks the end of the Skywalker Saga as we know it, and you bet the toys are getting in on it. These 3.75\", \u201cCommemorative Edition\u201d packs (Around $22 each) \u2014 one for each of the main movies \u2014 are simple golden repaints of the already available basic 3.75\" action figures.\n\nWhile the movie-specific sets (including Vader and a Stormtrooper for A New Hope, Leia and Han for Empire Strikes Back, Luke and Chewbacca for Return of the Jedi, and more), will be available on a wide release, Walmart will have an exclusive three-pack of C-3PO, BB-8, and R2-D2.\n\nKotobukiya ARTFX+ Kits\n\nKotobukiya\u2019s line of lavish Star Wars statues is getting two new entrants based on the upcoming movie. First up is a 1/7 scale vignette of BB-8 and D-O (Around $165), which includes accessories to pose BB-8 with his little lighter \u201cthumbs up\u201d out toward his new robotic friend. The second is not one, but two Sith Troopers (Around $190) packaged together, one brandishing a rifle, the other setting up a hefty looking \u201cmega blaster\u201d heavy weapon.\n\nRoleplay Items\n\nIf you prefer to pretend you\u2019re a hero or villain of the Star Wars saga instead of playing with miniaturised versions of those heroes, Hasbro\u2019s line of roleplay toys will bring a variety of weapons and gear to kit yourself out in. Want a lightsaber? Well, there\u2019ll be basic telescoping (Around $12) and electronic (Around $30) versions of sabers from across the saga, from general Sith and Jedi designs to specific ones based on Luke, Vader, or even Rey\u2019s \u201creforged\u201d version of the Skywalker blade from Rise.\n\nSpeaking of lightsabers, two interesting and eclectic electronic versions will also be available: the first is a Galaxy of Adventures \u201cScream Saber\u201d (Around $45), which has three modes. One plays traditional lightsaber noises when you wave it, one plays weird noises from across the Star Wars saga, from TIE Fighter engine blasts to Droid beeps, and the third \u2014 and most potentially headache-inducing \u2014 lets users record their own voice clips to play with every swing instead.\n\nMeanwhile, in the less nightmarish world, there\u2019s the Lightsaber Academy Interactive Battle Saber (Around $75). Paired with an app for phones and mobile devices, the blade features a series of kyber crystals users can swap out to give themselves a different Sith or Jedi master from the Star Wars saga, who will guide them in a series of lightsaber drills in the app to develop their martial prowess.\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer a blaster by your side instead of the ancient weapons and hokey religions, NERF will have two guns based on The Rise of Skywalker: Poe Dameron\u2019s pistol (Around $38) and a Sith Trooper blaster rifle (Around $60), both of which fire glowing \u201cGlowStrike\u201d darts and make blaster noises.\n\nIf you\u2019re firing darts in your very own Star War, you\u2019ll need face protection \u2014 so why not pick up a Kylo Ren \u201cForce Rage\u201d mask (Around $50)? As well as playing clips of Kylo\u2019s dialogue from the films, speaking into the mask activates a vocoder that not only masks your voice to sound like the new Supreme Leader, but makes the cracked kyber fault lines over it glow!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something higher-end, the Black Series will offer two Star Wars saga items that are a bit fancier: First up is Luke\u2019s X-Wing pilot helmet (Around $150), which comes with synced-up LED lights and speakers that work to replicate the action of either Luke\u2019s X-Wing flying over the Death Star in A New Hope or his Snowspeeder in the Battle of Hoth in Empire Strikes Back.\n\nMeanwhile, in the sequel series era, there\u2019ll be a fancy new edition of the Force FX Elite Kylo Ren Lightsaber (Around $450), befitting his new status as Supreme Leader of the First Order. The newly updated saber features lights and sounds to create several different effects of Ren\u2019s crackling, angry blade, pulsing with energy and being generally intimidating, as Ben Solo is wont to do. If you just want to display it, however, the saber also comes with a display stand to hold the hilt either with or without the blade attachments, and even a commemorative coin.\n\nDisney Parks Exclusives\n\nNow that Galaxy\u2019s Edge is open in both Anaheim and Orlando, you didn\u2019t think they would miss out with their own merch to sell, did you? For now, there are only two toys you\u2019ll find exclusively at the parks. The first is a small model of Poe\u2019s new X-Wing fighter (Around $30), while the latter is a new addition to the Droid Factory line, a four-pack of Droid figures (Around $45) that includes D-O and three new astromechs from The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nHasbro Interactive Droids\n\nAfter Sphero captured the imaginations (and wallets) of the world with its interactive toys of R2-D2, BB-8, and BB-9E for The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, this time around Hasbro is taking on the world of remote controlled droid goodness. On the cheaper end of the spectrum are two \u201cSpark and Go\u201d toys of D-O and BB-8 (Around $22) \u2014 which kids can \u201crev up\u201d and then release to see the droids speed along and play lights and sounds inspired by their antics in the movies.\n\nFor those with the cash to splash, though, is the Ultimate Interactive D-O droid (Around $222). Much closer to Sphero\u2019s interactive droids from movies past, this D-O features lights and sounds as well as movable antennae as he trundles along on his singular wheel, self-balancing as he goes. The droid can be either controlled by a free downloadable app, letting users pilot the droid themselves, or by using a small ball included with the set (that can be charged alongside D-O on a themed charging stand when you\u2019re doing playing) that D-O can be instructed to either follow as you hold it, or chase it like he\u2019s a little mechanical dog. D\u2019aaaw!\n\nS.H. Figuarts Figures\n\nAlthough they won\u2019t be out until November, preorders will open on Force Friday for three new entrants in Tamashii Nation\u2019s expansive line of Star Wars figuarts based on the new movie (Approx. $90 - $100 each). Rey will come complete with her lightsaber, staff, blaster and even a little D-O to potter alongside her, with an alternate piece to pose her with her hood up. Kylo Ren comes with a cloth robe, as well as his lightsaber and head options to pose him either maskless or with his new, reforged helmet. Lastly, the Sith Trooper comes with three different blasters, as well as a stand to pose the heaviest rifle of the three atop.\n\nThe Mandalorian\n\n6\" Black Series Action Figures\n\nFor now, just two figures (Around $30 each) from the new Disney+ show will be a part of Hasbro\u2019s 6\" line. One is, of course, the one you want \u2014 the Mandalorian himself. Coming with his blaster and Amban Phase pulse rifle, Pedro Pascal\u2019s mysterious bounty hunter will be joined by a surprising second character in the line: a Jawa!\n\nDescribed as having hitched a ride from Tatooine in search of scrap to sell, the Offworld Jawa is pretty much what you\u2019d expect: a Jawa, with a couple of blasters and a grey-brown colour scheme to differentiate it. These two will be available as part of the same wave of figures as the Rise of Skywalker ones seen above.\n\nMeanwhile, coming later this fall is a figure of Gina Carano\u2019s mysterious ex-Rebel-turned-Merc (Around $30), complete with knife, pistol, and rifle accessories.\n\nLego\n\nIt\u2019s a similar case here as before. Just one of the offerings from Lego on October 4 has a Mandalorian theme, and like Mattel\u2019s offering, it\u2019s vehicular \u2014 specifically, the same reclaimed Raider AT-ST. Coming in at 540 pieces, the set features a buildable AT-ST as well as four minifigures: two Klatoonian raiders, the Mandalorian and Cara Dune.\n\nThe Vintage Collection AT-ST Raider\n\nScaled with the 3.75\" Vintage Collection figures, this third iteration on the Raider (Around $120) comes with a lone raider figure, as well as articulated blasters and an opening cockpit.\n\nFunko Pop! Vinyls\n\nAlthough nowhere near the madness of the amount available for The Rise of Skywalker, Funko will be releasing multiple Pop figurines ($19 each) based on The Mandalorian. Beyond the titular hunter, you\u2019ll be able to get figures of Cara Dune, the killer assassin droid IG-11 and Kuiil, a diminutive little Ugnaught we know next to nothing about.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\n\n6\" Black Series Action Figures\n\nThree Black Series figures (Around $30) available on Force Friday come from the world of Respawn\u2019s new Rise of the Empire-era adventure game. Fans will be able to pick up figures of both Fallen Order\u2019s hero, former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis (who also comes with his adorable little droid, BD-1), as well as the sinister Dark Side agent chasing after him in the game, the Second Sister, complete with her spinning dual-bladed lightsaber.\n\nThe last, exclusive to Gamestop stores, is another villain: the sinister Purge Trooper (Around $30), black-armoured Stormtroopers who we\u2019ve seen wielding electrified staves in the trailers that can block Cal\u2019s lightsaber. Sadly, press pictures for the toy only show the Purge Trooper coming with two blasters.\n\nFunko Pop! Vinyls\n\nSecond verse, same as the first: Cal and the Second Sister are the only two Fallen Order offerings coming from Funko ($19 each) on Triple Force Friday. Like his Black Series figure, Cal also comes with BD-1 as a separate little figurine, instead of the droid getting a Pop of his own.\n\nEditor's Note: Exact pricing and availability in Australia is currently unavailable, and will likely be revealed this Friday alongside the release.
