Adam] Schiff,\" Collins, R-Ga., told host Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"They have decided to walk down a path in which they are in contrary to American values. They're not going to allow this president to have due process. They're not going to be fair. They're going to ramrod this thing through.\"\n\nCollins also said Trump was \"not in jeopardy of being removed from office. He's in jeopardy of having to continue that onslaught of lies and attacks and half-truths from a one-sided investigation in the House.\"\n\nSCHIFF: AGREEMENT REACHED FOR WHISTLEBLOWER TO TESTIFY\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma at the same time as his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump also has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIn the July call, Zelensky appeared to make an effort to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces, telling him at least twice that he was \"absolutely right.\" But, after the White House released a rough transcript this week based on officials\u2019 recollections of the call, Zelensky told reporters he didn\u2019t feel pushed, emphasizing that \"no one can pressure me.\" He also sought to play down the situation involving Biden and his son\u2019s activities in Ukraine, calling it just one of \"many cases that I talk about with leaders of other countries.\"\n\nThis past Friday, Trump demanded Schiff resign after the House Intelligence Committee chairman read an exaggerated take of the call during a hearing. \"I have a favor I want from you,\" Schiff, D-Calif., said while appearing to read from a piece of paper. \"And, I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.\"\n\nSchiff later said, \"My summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPelosi, D-Calif., has defended her decision to announce the formal impeachment inquiry into Trump last week, after saying for months that she wasn't yet on board. She told CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" in an interview that aired Sunday night, \"It is wrong for a president to say that he wants you -- another head of state -- to create something negative about his possible political opponent to his own advantage, at the expense of our national security, his oath of office to the Constitution and the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw and Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo contributed to this report.", "description": "House Judiciary Committee\u00a0Ranking Member\u00a0Doug Collins\u00a0said Sunday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has \"abused\" her role with her treatment of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, claiming the president won't receive \"due process\" over a whistleblower's claim\u00a0he improperly\u00a0pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and his son\u00a0Hunter, who served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
