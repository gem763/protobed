Sure, Telstra, Optus, and Vodafone have some pretty decent plans, but they\u2019re not as exciting as they could be.\n\nOn the other hands, smaller telcos seem to keep pushing plan value higher and higher. Data allowances are rising, and monthly fees are getting lower. If you\u2019re happy to look beyond the big brands, you\u2019re sure to bag a bargain. Here\u2019s five of our favourite deals around right now.\n\namaysim\n\namaysim is running one hell of a deal right now: $40 gets you 60GB on a 28-day expiry. In addition, you\u2019ll get unlimited standard international calls to 10 countries, and another 300 minutes for a further 22 destinations. If you\u2019re after a no-contract plan around the $40 mark, it\u2019s hard to do better. This deal runs until October 1, so if you\u2019re keen, you\u2019ll want to move pretty quickly. amaysim is powered by the Optus network.\n\nJeenee Mobile\n\nJeenee Mobile is another great choice. $20.25 per month gets you 15GB of data on a 12-month contract. However, you will have to pay a setup fee of $12.37 to get started. Jeenee Mobile is also powered by the Optus network.\n\nIf you just want a cheap plan, Jeenee also has another decent deal. $12.50 per month gets you 5GB on a 12-month contract. Better yet, you\u2019ll get your first six months for just $8.98 per month. That\u2019s hard to beat when it comes to a \u201csmall\u201d plan. As with the previous Jeenee plan we mentioned, you\u2019ll need to pay $12.37 upfront.\n\nBelong\n\nTelstra budget brand Belong gets you the kind of bargains you could never imagine its parent company offering. For example, $25 per month gets you 10GB on a no-contract Belong plan, whereas you\u2019d pay $49 per month for 15GB on Telstra proper.\n\nBelong plans all have data rollover, which means you can stockpile unused data indefinitely. If you manage to build up a sizeable data burn and want to save money, you can always drop down to Belong's $10 plan until you burn through your stash.\n\nWoolworths Mobile\n\nIf you\u2019re after more data on the Telstra network, the fresh food people have you covered. On Woolworths Mobile, you can currently get 40GB for $40 per month on a 12-month contract, with an additional 10GB of bonus data every three months if you sign up before November 17. Woolies also offers data banking, allowing you to store up to 100GB of unused data for a later date.\n\nAlex Choros is Managing Editor at WhistleOut, Australia's phone and internet comparison website.\n\nAs Gizmodo editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too.
