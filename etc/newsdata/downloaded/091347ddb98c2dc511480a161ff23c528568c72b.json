The company, best known for its search engine and phone software, has branched into hardware in recent years as manufacturers seek to secure a future in wireless accessories and the smart home.\n\nThe Pixel 4 comes with a dual camera on the rear of the phone, with a distinctive camera bump similar to the design of Apple's new iPhone.\n\nThe company also revealed a new way of controlling a smartphone, dubbed \u201cmotion sense\u201d. The technology uses a radar chip in the smartphone to let users control it using gestures in the air, with controls for skipping songs, snoozing an alarm or silencing calls.", "description": "Google has unveiled a new smartphone that can be controlled by moving hands in mid-air as the search giant presents its latest alternative to Apple\u2019s iPhone.", "authors": ["Matthew Field", "Tom Hoggins", "Laurence Dodds", "Harry De Quetteville", "James Titcomb"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/15/google-pixel-header_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOUXNkuaWnsqcZP1ZJrxCo5AUtcosy2k0gmSxiUCJ2zk.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
