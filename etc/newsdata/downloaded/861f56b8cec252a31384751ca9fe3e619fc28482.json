For the center-right to hammer out a peace the religious right can live with, it needs a counterpart on the left that can stand up to its illiberal flanks and deliver a deal.\n\nToday, that portion of the center-left is small and quiet. The large remainder too often goes along with the illiberals \u2014 either loudly out of conviction or quietly out of fear. As long as that\u2019s true, and as long as left-wing hegemony persists over key economic and cultural institutions, many social conservatives will understandably view French\u2019s procedural liberalism as a guide to losing gracefully.\n\nA principled argument can be made that conservative Christians should be prepared for just such a loss, rather than trying to force what is now a minority opinion on the emerging secular majority. If the mainstream shuns them, they can withdraw into insular religious communities, as ultra-Orthodox Jews and the Amish have done, exchanging mainstream socioeconomic status for a space where their faith can thrive. This is hardly a prescription for doom; these are among the fastest-growing demographics in the country.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to argue persuasively that someone else should abandon the benefits of mainstream life in defending their convictions.", "description": "", "authors": ["Megan Mcardle", "Beta.Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Why-Conservatives-Feel-Threatened-By-The-Illiberal-Left Https"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
