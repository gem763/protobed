It was a gamble that could make him Britain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister.\n\nThe leader of the opposition called on Johnson to stand down immediately after the prime minister suffered total humiliation in the courts, where his behavior was condemned unanimously by Britain\u2019s 11 most senior judges. Asked by The Daily Beast if Johnson will now be forced to resign over the defeat, a British government minister replied: \u201cGoodness knows.\u201d\n\nJohnson suspended Parliament for five weeks ahead of Britain\u2019s scheduled exit from the EU at the end of October. Lawmakers from every major party in the British Parliament reacted furiously to the move, saying it was intended to prevent scrutiny of Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan. In a bombshell verdict delivered Tuesday morning, judges agreed.\n\nThe ruling said there was \u201cno justification\u201d for the suspension, and that: \u201cThe effect on the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d\n\nIt is an unprecedented decision that will permanently rebalance Britain\u2019s mostly unwritten constitution, after the supreme court, which was only established in 2009, asserted its power to hold No. 10 to account.\n\nJohnson, who is in New York at the United Nations General Assembly, now faces an extraordinary and unenviable set of questions over when to return to Parliament, and how to grovel to the Queen.\n\nAsked about the ruling, Johnson refused to apologize and said: \u201cI don't think that it's right, but we will go ahead and of course Parliament will come back ... The important thing is we get on and deliver Brexit on October 31.\u201d\n\nThe supreme court went out of its way to avoid ruling on whether Johnson had lied to the Queen or directly misled her, but there can be no doubt that the palace will be furious that Johnson acted unlawfully in advising her to shut down Parliament in a traditional practice known as \u201cproroguing.\u201d\n\nPublicly, Johnson said the shutdown was a routine procedure to prepare for a new Parliament and did not take power out of the hands of Parliament. If he told the Queen the same thing over the phone, he is guilty of the unprecedented deception of Britain\u2019s head of state.\n\nThe supreme court\u2019s verdict ruled that the prime minister\u2019s advice was unlawful and, therefore, parliament has not been suspended at all in the eyes of the law. After delivering the historic verdict, Lady Hale, president of the supreme court, urged lawmakers to take \u201cimmediate steps\u201d to reconvene Parliament.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Commons John Bercow welcomed the ruling in a statement and said Parliament will reconvene Wednesday morning. Just minutes after the ruling was announced, members of Parliament began re-entering the House of Commons.\n\nAs the verdict was handed down, there were gasps and cheers in Brighton on England\u2019s south coast, where lawmakers from Britain\u2019s opposition Labour party are holding their annual conference.\n\nEmily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary was on stage at an event when the verdict was read out by members of the audience. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d she said, throwing her head back in laughter.\n\nAs lawmakers debated whether to race to the train station and return to Westminster, Jeremy Corbyn interrupted the program in the main conference hall to demand Johnson step aside. He said: \u201cI invite Boris Johnson in the historic words to consider his position and become the shortest-serving prime minister there\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nAs the prime minister tried to sound defiant in New York, his authority continued to crumble back home amid recriminations over his high-risk strategy of shutting down parliament.\n\nA former member of Johnson\u2019s Cabinet, Amber Rudd, who quit over the Brexit policy, revealed that the prime minister had not shared legal advice over the prorogation with members of his cabinet.\n\nConservative lawmaker and former justice secretary David Gauke said the prime minister should formally apologize. \u201cI do think there\u2019s a need for an apology to Parliament,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nGauke also turned his fire on Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, who is thought to be behind Johnson\u2019s move to shut down parliament, saying the adviser\u2019s position was now \u201cuntenable.\u201d\n\nNigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party, said: \u201cThe calling of a Queen\u2019s Speech and prorogation is the worst political decision ever. Dominic Cummings must go.\u201d", "description": "The highest court in the U.K. ruled that the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament was \u201cunlawful, void, and of no effect.\u201d", "authors": ["Jamie Ross", "Nico Hines", "London Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3375,w_6000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569316500/RTX734QE_er0fxk", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
