REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nThe dramatic move by House of Representatives Democrats compounded investors\u2019 anxieties with confidence already shaken by new worries about U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was down 0.82%, Japan's Nikkei .N225 fell 0.63%, while Australian shares fell 0.60%.\n\nChinese shares slumped and oil futures extended declines after Trump harshly criticised Beijing\u2019s trade practices in a speech at the United Nations, damping hopes for a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nThe dollar nursed losses against most major currencies as the inquiry sets the stage for a fierce battle between Democrats and Trump\u2019s Republican Party over whether the president sought foreign influence to smear a political rival.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment probe has put a dent in Asian shares,\u201d said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cChinese shares were already exposed to downside risks. Trump\u2019s comments likely increased those risks. There are worries about U.S. consumer sentiment. There are also concerns that China\u2019s economic slowdown hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d\n\nU.S. stock futures, ESc1, rose 0.06% in Asia on Wednesday, but the mild gains are unlikely to improve sentiment for Asian shares.\n\nThe push for an impeachment inquiry and disappointing U.S. economic data weighed on Wall Street on Tuesday, pushing the S&P 500 .SPX 0.84% lower, its biggest daily decline in a month.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives will launch a formal impeachment inquiry over whether Trump sought help from the Ukraine to smear former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Trump has denied the claims.\n\nIt is unlikely that the impeachment inquiry would lead to Trump\u2019s removal from office. Even if the Democratic-controlled House voted to impeach Trump, the Republican-majority Senate would have to take the next step of removing him from office after a trial.\n\nHowever, the development injects fresh uncertainty into financial markets, which have already been heavily jostled by emerging global political risks in recent years.\n\n\u201cIf an impeachment enquiry looks like ending his re-election chances in 2020, he may throw caution to the wind and harden his attitude to a China trade deal, increasing the chances of a global recession next year,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, Senior Market Analyst, Asia Pacific, OANDA.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY measuring the greenback against a basket of six major currencies was little changed after falling 0.3% on Tuesday.\n\nChinese shares .CSI300 fell 0.79% while shares in Hong Kong .HSI skidded by 1.23%\n\nTrump said on Tuesday Beijing had failed to keep promises it made when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and was engaging in predatory practices that had cost millions of jobs in the United States and other countries.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 dipped 0.75% to $56.86 a barrel. Brent crude LCOc1 fell 0.86% to $62.55 per barrel.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war, which has dragged on for more than a year, has added pressure on China\u2019s already slowing economy and has increased the risk of recession in other countries. Slower global growth would hurt demand for energy and other commodities.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2473 GBP=D3, down 0.2%, having trimmed some of its overnight gains made following the UK court ruling.\n\nIn response to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Johnson said he disagreed and vowed that Britain would leave the EU by Oct. 31 deadline, come what may.\n\nCalls for Johnson\u2019s resignation could grow, which would cast even more uncertainty over how the UK would complete its divorce from the EU.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose to 1.6352%, while the two-year yield US2YT=RR rose to 1.6096%.", "description": "Asian stocks fell on Wednesday after U.S. lawmakers called for an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, increasing the prospects of prolonged political uncertainty in the world's largest economy.", "authors": ["Stanley White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433604939&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O06O", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
