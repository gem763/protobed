Ambitious startup CEO Mr Tanasyuk is merging the worlds of cryptocurrency and space travel by allowing blockchain buyers to invest in extraterrestrial projects - before 'rewarding' them with the funds raised by selling the data extracted from the missions. Pavlo Tanasyuk is also the CEO of BlockVerify, a company providing 'transparency' to supply chains using blockchain cryptocurrency technology. And he also ran the payment system company MoneXy before selling it to invest in space projects. He graduated with a MPhil in Technology Policy from Cambridge University in 2010 and with an MSc in Management and Information Systems from the London School of Economics in 2008 - after studying General Management at Stanford Business school in 2006.\n\nThe plan is for the small rover to depart from the lander, travelling just 10m before sending HD video and 3D LIDAR data from its onboard sensors.\n\nHis company, SpaceBit, has joined forces with Astrobotic, a Pittsburgh-based lunar exploration firm given almost $80million (\u00a365m) to send private firms to the moon in 2021.\n\nThe SpaceBit rover will be flown into space on Astrobotic's own Peregrine lander mission.\n\nThe reason for the legs is that in future lunar missions, the rover will go into lava tubes, which has not been possible before.\n\nThe SpaceBit rover can withstand temperatures from up to 130\u00b0C (266\u00b0F) to -130\u00b0C (-202\u00b0F) at night, and will explore for the duration of a lunar day.\n\nMr Tanasyuk said: 'It will spend up to 10 days on the moon before going into the night and basically freezing forever.'\n\nHe added: 'This mission will result in the first payload from the UK to reach the Moon surface and mark the beginning of a new era in commercial space exploration for Britain.'\n\nOnly three other countries have put a rover on the moon, the US, Russia and China \u2013 and next it could be the UK.\n\nThe SpaceBit rover will fly to the moon on Astrobotic's Peregrine lander, which has been awarded NASA funding to carry some of the US space agency's implements to the lunar surface\n\nMr Tanasyuk said he wanted to 'democratise' the space industry. He announced SpaceBIT at Inside Bitcoins, Berlin, in 2015\n\nIn May, Nasa announced that Astrobotic and two other companies had been awarded funding to build lunar landers.\n\nAstrobotic's Peregrine mission \u2013 its lander is about eight feet (2.5m) wide and six feet (1.9m) tall \u2013 will take up to 14 NASA instruments to the moon as well as private payloads.\n\nSpaceBit will be one of those partners, sending the rover to the surface inside Astrobotic's Peregrine lander, which is expected to land in June or July 2021.\n\nNASA boss teases announcement the space agency is teaming up with private firms\n\nThe Spacebit rover will scuttle across the surface taking measurements and collecting exploration data\n\nOnce the lander reaches the moon, the 3lbs (1.5kg) rover will drop from beneath it to the surface along with other payloads.\n\nThe moon over Greenwich in south east London. Only three countries have so far successfully landed on the lunar surface with rovers or people \u2013 the US, China and Russia\n\nIt will scuttle across the surface taking measurements and collecting exploration data that can be analysed for scientific and exploration purposes.\n\nIt also has two cameras that will enable it to take 'robot selfies', SpaceBit said.\n\nIn an interview published on Medium in 2018, Mr Tanasyuk said he wanted to 'democratise' the space industry by allowing people to privately fund missions using cryptocurrency.\n\nHe outlined plans for SpaceBit to use instruments \u2013 a satellite or rover, for example \u2013 to collect data from the lunar surface then sell it online.\n\nThis would be made available to people using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, he suggested.", "description": "Cambridge graduate Pavlo Tanasyuk, the CEO and founder of British company SpaceBit, will send a tiny four-legged space rover weighing just 3lbs (1.5kg) to the moon in a NASA-funded mission.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19534752-0-image-a-7_1570704681936.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
