From toys for story time to their very own phone and record player, here\u2019s ten of the very best musical toys.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

This toy is full of sensory features that can be enjoyed from as young as six-months-old and up to three years of age; from the contrasting black and white panda design to the large bright orange and yellow flashing buttons.\n\nYour child can create tunes by pressing the two turntable buttons on the deck, along with spinning and sliding to authentic record scratch sounds. With all the music toys on the market, it\u2019s refreshing to find one that actually creates quite pleasant background noise, meaning we will no longer get \u201cI\u2019m a little teapot\u201d stuck in our heads for hours. It\u2019s versatile too: younger ones will find it brings excitement to tummy time while older children will enjoy carrying it around and playing with it at the kitchen table. A great all-round toy.\n\nBuy now\n\nLeapFrog 2 leapstory: \u00a334.99, Symths Toys\n\nMake bedtime a lot more fun with this storytelling cube from Leapfrog. Our tired parent testers loved that it already comes with eighty different tracks. These include classic stories, such as Sleeping Beauty and The Frog Prince, along with myths and legends and learning songs like \u201cFive Little Birdies\u201d and \u201cLondon Bridge is Falling Down\u201d, meaning you never run out of something new each evening.\n\nParents who can\u2019t always make bed time will love the option to record their own voice and the timer mode means you can make sure story time doesn\u2019t overrun into sleep time. Our little testers loved the projector option; which shows animations on to the wall as the story progresses. While the product is suitable for children aged three and above, we found younger siblings were equally mesmerised and still loved to listen along.\n\nBuy now\n\nLittle Tikes stand \u2018n dance starfish: \u00a320, Argos\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a musical toy that will adapt to your little one\u2019s development, the stand \u2018n dance starfish is a great choice. Babies who can sit up will love pressing the large, flat colourful pads of the keyboard at the base of the toy, which light up and play a tune. When beginning to walk, cruising babies can hold on to the handles and dance along, and once walking, they can use their feet on the piano keys and use the ball drop slide. The slide in particular kept toddlers entertained for quite some time while younger testers loved reaching for the light up musical pads over and over again.\n\nBuy now\n\nIn The Night Garden fun phone: \u00a310.99, Smyths Toys\n\nHave a child who loves to snatch the phone out of your hands? This plastic, durable In The Night Garden-themed toy phone is a great solution. Small hands will love the four supersized buttons; which play a variety of sounds and phrases from the show (with chat from characters like IglePiggle and Upsy Daisy). Unlike real mobile phones, this one is much more hardwearing, so don\u2019t worry if it gets flung across the room. Its size makes it the perfect toy to pop in your bag for car journeys but, because of this, its functions are fairly limited, so be warned that it won\u2019t necessarily keep your little ones entertained for hours on end.\n\nBuy now\n\nFisher Price music box record player: \u00a335, JoJo Maman Bebe\n\nThis iconic record player is almost 50 years old, providing much nostalgia since we remember having it ourselves as a child. Yet it\u2019s still bringing music into the living rooms of a new generation. Unlike lots of toys on the market, the premise is simple: handy slot store five records, each of which is double sided, containing two different tunes. Pop on your very own turntable and enjoy nursery rhyme classics such as \u201dHumpty Dumpty\u201d and \u201cHickory Dickory Dock\u201d that play out. The volume is great for such a small item and the useful handle means older children will also enjoy carrying this around with them too.\n\nBuy now\n\nPlan Toys wooden kazoo: \u00a310, Royal Opera House Shop\n\nAs we are becoming more conscious of the environment than ever before, it\u2019s hard not to notice the sheer amount of plastic in many of our toy boxes. This wooden kazoo is a lovely alternative and proves toys don\u2019t have to be electronic to be a lot of fun. As a kazoo makes sounds after hearing your voice, our mini tester loved creating lots of different sounds by humming into the small wooden end, which is amplified by the red horn at the opposite end. This kazoo is made from sustainable wood, recycled packaging, and water-based ink; making it a fantastic ethical purchase.\n\nBuy now\n\nEarly Learning Centre percussion mat: \u00a323.99, Early Learning Centre\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a music toy that takes up minimum space and can be kept easily on your playroom floor, we love the ELC percussion mat. Younger babies can use the small tummy time cushion that\u2019s included to explore the mat with their hands, while older siblings can stomp along with their feet at the same time. The images of the violin, trumpet, drum, and piano can be pressed to change the kind of instrument sound that plays, which makes this a good way to introduce children to different types of music. Don\u2019t worry about sticky fingers and feet, it wipes clean in seconds.\n\nBuy now\n\nHape rock and rhythm band: \u00a335, Argos\n\nAny budding musician will love this drum and cymbal set by Hape, ideal for a busy toddler who has lots of energy. The kit looks really authentic, comprising of a stand, three drums, a cymbal and two sticks to play them with. Our tester found it really easy to grip and move with the sticks and really enjoyed creating different sounds and rhythms. Thankfully, you won\u2019t have to cover your ears while your little one plays as the design restricts the volume this makes. As well as being a lot of fun, this one is great for building toddler\u2019s coordination and movement.\n\nBuy now\n\nBaby Clementoni interactive dancing hippo: \u00a325, Baby Clementoni\n\nThere\u2019s quite a few different interactive animal toys on the market but we have a particular soft spot for Philip, the dancing hippo. Suitable for ten months and up, the adorable hippo performs a variety of functions, from dancing to clapping his paws. There\u2019s lots of interactivity, with the idea that little ones join in with Philip\u2019s movements to help get a sense of rhythm. There\u2019s also an educational element; by pressing on either of Philip\u2019s feet; children can listen along to rhymes that teach them all about numbers, different animals and their sounds. A gift that\u2019s both educational and extremely enjoyable.\n\nBuy now\n\nEarly Learning Centre music maker: \u00a315, Early Learning Centre\n\nMost of the musical toys we found were only suitable for one-year-olds and over, so we were pleased to find this one that babies can enjoy. This music maker is a fantastic introduction to sounds and allows you to create your very own sensory class in your living room. The shimmering beads on the rattles mesmerised our baby and the bells and clacking cymbals provided good fun too.\n\nThis is perfect for gripping and shaking and we found the vibrant design encouraged our little one to reach out, making it great for introducing coordination skills. The rattles can be joined together to create one giant music maker or separated to be popped in a changing bag for instant amusement on the go.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Musical toys\n\nFor a modern musical toy, we loved the Infantino spin and slide DJ panda, but for a little bit of nostalgia, we also love Fisher Price\u2019s record player. Finally, we loved the leapstory, a nifty device that brings excitement and education to story time.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
