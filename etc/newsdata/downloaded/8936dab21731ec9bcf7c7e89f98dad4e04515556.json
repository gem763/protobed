The sharing finger food was a great leveller.\n\nBest thing about Georgia?\n\nHer smile and sense of humour.\n\nWould you introduce her to your friends?\n\nFor sure. They would like her more than they like me.\n\nDescribe Georgia in three words?\n\nFunny, intelligent, intriguing.\n\nWhat do you think she made of you?\n\nConfident, friendly and honest. We laughed a lot, so hopefully fun, too.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nTo a pub.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nYes, we did.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nOrder more of the sashimi tuna tacos.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\n8.5.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nMy fingers are firmly crossed for a second date.\n\nGeorgia on Bud\n\nWhat were you hoping for?\n\nI had asked for newly single Liam Hemsworth, but was happy to have an evening of free food and wine.\n\nFirst impressions?\n\nHe wasn\u2019t American, which threw me.\n\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nThe origins of his name, the benefits of watching Love Island, and the weirdest items I\u2019ve seen at work.\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nEarly on in the evening, I had already set him homework. The waiter found it very amusing.\n\nGood table manners?\n\nHe kept my wine glass well topped up.\n\nBest thing about Bud?\n\nExtremely easy to get along with and very complimentary.\n\nWould you introduce him to your friends?\n\nMy friend says that no one is trustworthy unless they have a 26-30 railcard. I can only assume that he doesn\u2019t.\n\nBlind date: \u2018We talked about our best vomit stories\u2019 Read more\n\nDescribe Bud in three words?\n\nYouthful, engaging, zestful.\n\nWhat do you think he made of you?\n\nWe hadn\u2019t managed to finish the main course before he asked for my number.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nTo a pub for a final drink before curfew.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nAll good dates end with a kiss.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nWe should have ordered more food. It was amazing.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\nA strong 9.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nThe age gap means I don\u2019t think this is the start of a Bud-ing romance.\n\n\u2022 Bud and Georgia ate at Bloomsbury Street Kitchen, London WC1.
