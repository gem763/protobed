Howell, an Obama appointee, said it\u2019s fair for the Democrats to have all relevant material to the special counsel\u2019s probe into the Trump campaign and alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election for their impeachment inquiry.\n\nShe said the Justice Department\u2019s argument that existing law bars the release of grand jury material is \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn carrying out the weighty constitutional duty of determining whether impeachment of the President is warranted, Congress need not redo the nearly two years of effort spent on the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, nor risk being misled by witnesses, who may have provided information to the grand jury and the Special Counsel,\u201d Judge Howell wrote in the 75-page order.\n\nAfter Attorney General William Barr released only redacted portions of the special counsel\u2019s nearly 500-page report, House Democrats moved to subpoena the material.\n\nThey sought documents sans redactions, exhibits from the report and any testimony related to the president\u2019s knowledge of Russia\u2019s attempted interference with the 2016 election, including any knowledge of crimes committed by his campaign officials.\n\nThe judge recognized generally grand jury material is not to be released, but she said there\u2019s an exception to the rule ahead of a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d Judge Howell reasoned the potential impeachment trial in the Senate would meet that exception, granting the release.\n\n\u201cThe need for continued secrecy is reduced, given that the special counsel\u2019s grand jury investigation has ended, and is easily outweighed by [the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s] compelling need for the grand jury material,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department must turn over the material by Oct. 30, according to the court order.\n\nA spokesperson for the department said they are currently reviewing the decision.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
