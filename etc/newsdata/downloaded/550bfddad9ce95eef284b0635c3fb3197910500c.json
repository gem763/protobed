He cited the gunman who recently targeted Latinos at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart and the anti-Semitic mass shootings at synagogues in San Diego and Pittsburgh in the past year.\n\n\u201cThese terror suspects echoed white supremacist talk about \u2018replacement,\u2019 hatred towards Jews, immigrants, refugees, and that\u2019s not including the would-be attacks we\u2019ve seen thwarted by law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Avlon said.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a startling statistic: Since 9/11, right-wing terrorists have killed more people in the United States than jihadist terrorists, according to New America,\u201d he said, citing the public policy think tank.\n\n\u201cThere are some folks for their own political purposes would like to keep the focus on only one form of political violence over another, but that would be unwise, because we don\u2019t have the luxury of choosing which threats we face,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a case to be made that these threats actually echo each other. They\u2019re weaponized versions of tribalism, motivated by fear and finding identity in their hatred of the \u2018other.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Avlon ended his speech by urging Americans to not let \u201chate win or fear define us.\u201d\n\nThe segment received a barrage of backlash on social media, mostly by conservatives who were offended by the timing. Many argued that it was inappropriate to hype right-wing extremism when it was Islamic terrorists who attacked the country on Sept. 11, 2001, and killed nearly 3,000 people.\n\nMr. Avlon responded to the outrage by re-posting an essay he wrote after 9/11 about the resilience of New York City.\n\n\u201cOne of my rules is that you don\u2019t feed the trolls, but for folks like the guy who emailed today that he wished I was killed in the World Trade Center, might want to read this essay about 9/11 that I wrote called The Resilient City,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday night.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
