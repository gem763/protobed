Times reports.\n\n\"I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\" Bolton instructed Hill to tell White House lawyers, according to the Times.\n\n\"Giuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\" Hill, during 9+ hours behind closed doors at the House Intelligence Committee, quoted Bolton as saying.\n\nSome White House officials are demoralized, amid unusual chaos and uncertainty, even for this West Wing, according to a former top Trump official.\n\n\"Others ... are girding for a fight and confident in their boss and the likely political outcome,\" the official said.\n\nMulvaney has complained to people that White House counsel Pat Cipollone is developing the impeachment legal strategy with Trump and not sharing information with key staff.\n\nMulvaney and Cipollone, Trump's two most vital strategists for impeachment, aren't getting on, as documented by the Times and others.\n\nAnd tensions are rising between Cipollone and those who think he has been playing this wrong.\n\nAt the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, House Democrats tell Axios that every witness has bolstered the case against Trump, with what Democrats contend is little contradictory evidence. Our takeaways:\n\nIf everyone agrees to appear, Democrats will have interviewed 11 Trump administration officials by the end of next week.\n\nThe people and agencies being called to Capitol Hill have now expanded to the White House Office of Management and Budget acting director Russ Vought, the Defense Department and Giuliani associates.\n\nAnd the daylong appearances by Hill \u2014 as well as former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, and former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch \u2014 show House investigators are being incredibly thorough in their questioning.\n\nDemocratic committee sources say Pelosi still maintains that their investigation needs to wrap by the end of the year.\n\nFinal bit of intrigue: Dems tell Axios that this week's depositions are private partly to prevent other witnesses from coordinating or aligning their testimony with what others say.\n\nBut they plan to release many transcripts to the public in the future.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nThis piece includes additional reporting by Zachary Basu.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
