NAP's Lac des Iles mine is a low-cost platinum group metals (PGM) producer, which is \"fully mechanised with a low labour complement\", says Implats.\n\nImplats says the deal will help it to move away from high-cost, deep-level conventional mining. \"The group is advancing its repositioning into a high-value, profitable and competitive PGM producer with a strong focus on low-risk, shallow, mechanised, palladium-rich assets.\"\n\nThe deal will also diversify its production base geographically, Implats said. Currently, the Implats operations are located in the Bushveld Complex in South Africa and in Zimbabwe.\n\nImplats is offering C$16.00 per share in cash to Brookfield Business Partners, which owns 81% of NAP's shares. It is also making an offer to buy minority shareholders. NAP is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nIt said that the restructuring of its Impala Rustenburg operation, as well as other cost savings and the stronger platinum prices, have helped it to fund the deal.\n\nNAP's board of directors have unanimously approved the transaction. Brookfield has also agreed to the deal.\n\nImplats said the deal will have to be approved by authorities, including exchange control approval from the South African Reserve Bank.", "description": "It owns a fully mechanised mine with a \"low labour complement\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6898/840e98949bd04da9b5225c160932a197.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
