But perhaps this was to be expected, since one of his senior advisers has declared that \u201cthere is no real answer\u201d to the country\u2019s problems.\n\nMahdi, a lugubrious figure in the best of times, delivered an especially dismal performance in the most important speech of his career on Friday, after his security forces had killed several dozen Iraqi protesters. He offered no answers, only mealy-mouthed platitudes about listening to the people\u2019s demands \u2014 and then cautioned that there was \u201cno magic solution.\u201d\n\nThis is unlikely to satisfy the protesters, who are asking him to do his job, not conjure up any tricks. Iraqis are fed up with the corruption and ineptitude that characterize their government, with the political impasse that defines their Parliament, with the growing influence of Iran in all aspects of the state, and with Mahdi\u2019s inability to do anything\u2026 about anything.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s response to days of increasingly angry protests has been to unleash his security forces, impose curfews and try to block the internet \u2014 the classic tells of a leader who has lost control of the situation. His government has also shut down its border with Iran, just as millions of Iranians were about to make their annual pilgrimage to the Iraqi shrine cities of Najaf and Karbala.\n\nThe crackdown on protesters cannot be sustained. Mahdi is a political weakling, and was only given his job because no party was able to form a governing coalition. If the violence continues, the parties that saw him as a useful compromise candidate will find him just as useful as a sacrificial lamb.\n\nThis would raise alarm in Washington, where anxiety about Mahdi being replaced by a more pro-Iran figure is bipartisan. Iraq is central to the Trump administration\u2019s Middle East policy, a front-line state in the confrontation with the Islamic Republic. And Mahdi is seen as more malleable to American persuasion than most of the prominent figures in Parliament.\n\nThe administration might therefore be tempted to intervene in the political morass that is Baghdad, to prop up the prime minister. That would be a grievous mistake.\n\nFor one thing, Iraqis are just as opposed to American interference as to Iranian influence; in their chants, protesters condemn both in the same breath. For another, they are demonstrably more opposed than Washington to a prime minister who bows to Tehran. Many of the protests are taking place in the southern cities of Iraq, home to the country\u2019s Shiite majority \u2014 a group assumed by U.S. policymakers to be disposed to favor their coreligionists in Iran. But the southern cities were where the strongest anti-Iran protests took place in the summer of 2018, which effectively ended the re-election prospects of Mahdi\u2019s predecessor, Haider al-Abadi \u2014 another Shiite.\n\nWashington backed Abadi in the political horse-trading that followed the May 2018 election. It didn\u2019t succeed then, and is unlikely to do much better if it tries to save Mahdi.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration should recognize that Mahdi is patently the wrong man to be running Iraq. Rather than protect him, it should use its leverage with the prime minister to demand the very reforms the protesters are demanding \u2014 and make American military and financial aid conditional on progress in achieving them.\n\nAnd if Mahdi is forced out by Parliament, the U.S. should allow the politics in Baghdad to play out to the satisfaction of Iraqis. American interests have never been more closely aligned with theirs.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Bobby Ghosh at aghosh73@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Gibney at jgibney5@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nBobby Ghosh is a columnist and member of the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.
