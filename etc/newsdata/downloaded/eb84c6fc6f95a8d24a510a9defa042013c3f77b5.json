Andy Street, the former head of John Lewis who is mayor of the West Midlands, even had to apologise to France in 2014 after calling the Gare du Nord \u201cthe squalor pit of Europe\u201d compared with what he called the \u201cmodern, forward-looking\u201d St Pancras.\n\nAlthough France has spent millions on small-scale changes to the Gare du Nord in recent years, rail authorities warning the nation\u2019s \u201cimage was at stake\u201d have joined with a major private commercial shopping centre investor to triple the station\u2019s surface area and overhaul the site before the Paris Olympics in 2024.\n\n\u201cThis project is unacceptable and we demand a rethink from floor to rafters,\u201d the protesting architects wrote in Le Monde, adding that it was indecent to send travellers up and down a mess of walkways, lifts and escalators, forcing them past shops to reach their platforms. They said that the vast volumes of the \u201cbeautiful\u201d train hall would be \u201cdenatured\u201d by adding high walkways. They warned of committing a \u201cserious urban error\u201d in the form of a giant shopping centre that risked killing smaller local trade in the Paris region.\n\nThe renovation will include working spaces \u2013 which some have suggested would allow companies to relocate from the UK after Brexit but stay close to the Eurostar \u2013 as well as a running track on the roof with views over Paris. A new Eurostar area will provide more space for customs checks after Brexit.\n\nThe aim is to have the station ready by the Paris Olympics in 2024, but work must take place while the Gare du Nord remains open to passengers \u2013 a complex process.\n\nThe architects said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to think the colossal project could be finished by 2024.\n\nGreen politicians in Paris have also complained about the plans and one local oversight body recently ruled against planning permission. But the Gare du Nord development team saw this as a minor hiccup. They will appeal and fully intend the work to go ahead.", "description": "Open letter attacks \u20ac600m plan to create vast shopping space in Paris railway station", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91e5b6938ae000fb5d47cf17b8fcad3aef9271e8/6_74_1436_862/master/1436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=484fb0a414bc8b83562222d83a2aa113"}
