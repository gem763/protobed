In one area, though, a new talking point has emerged: Don\u2019t believe the president.\n\nThis goes back to the president\u2019s appearance on the South Lawn on Oct. 3, when Trump asked China to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. There\u2019s no way to defend a president publicly asking a geopolitical rival to investigate domestic political rivals, so Republicans have decided to pretend he didn\u2019t do that. The first up was Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a real request,\u201d he told reporters Friday morning, \u201cI think he did it to provoke you to ask me and others and get outraged by it.\u201d Republicans on the Sunday shows followed suit. \u201cI doubt if the China comment was serious, to tell you the truth,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\" On ABC, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) feigned incredulity: \u201cGeorge, you really think he was serious about thinking that China\u2019s going to investigate the Biden family?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time that Republicans, confronted with a controversial Trump quote, have said the president wasn\u2019t being serious. Trump even told special counsel Robert S. Mueller III that his infamous request to Russia to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cmissing\u201d emails was a joke. That Capitol Hill Republicans would go back to this well is no surprise; it\u2019s an easy dodge when, according to The Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Philip Rucker, GOP lawmakers and aides say privately that their \u201ccollective strategy is simply to survive and not make any sudden moves.\u201d\n\nThe difference this time is that the president himself isn\u2019t claiming that he was joking, not in any of his numerous Twitter missives since that South Lawn appearance. Instead, he laid into criticism from Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) about his request to China. And Sunday afternoon he said on Twitter that he would \u201cwould LOVE running\" against Biden.\n\nNot only wasn\u2019t Trump joking about asking China to investigate Biden, he isn\u2019t pretending that he was. In other words, Republican politicians don\u2019t want you to believe the president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne reason Trump fit in so well with the GOP and especially its Fox News propaganda arm is that he and those around him have made livings telling people not to believe their own eyes. Years of \u201cTrump\u2019s a brilliant businessman, not a bumbling heir with multiple bankruptcies\u201d easily transitioned to \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, not taxpayers.\u201d But the narrative of \u201cright good, left bad\u201d was always bigger than one person, even one as influential as the president. Now, that narrative demands a new reality: \u201cDon\u2019t believe Trump even when he\u2019s telling you to believe him.\u201d The myth has swallowed Trump himself.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Sunday wrap: Republicans\u2019 pathetic excuses get shot down\n\nPaul Waldman: A guide to the GOP\u2019s increasingly pathetic defenses of Trump\n\nMax Boot: The GOP\u2019s choice: Betray Trump or betray the country?\n\nKathleen Parker: Trump\u2019s \u2018favor\u2019 may not seem worse than Biden\u2019s threat.
