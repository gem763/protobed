Both Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri have repeatedly failed to deny rumours of an affair.\n\nJohnson and Arcuri pictured together on a bus in 2015 when he was Mayor of London\n\nThe London Assembly has scheduled a discussion of its investigation for 2pm today, after Mr Johnson complied with a request for evidence from the oversight committee.\n\nMembers of the committee have so far agreed with a request from the Conservative Party leader's solicitors for the submitted papers to be kept confidential.\n\nOnly a few miles downstream, MPs were at the same time set to quiz Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan about a \u00a3100,000 grant that the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport gave Ms Arcuri's business.\n\nOne of Arcuri's businesses allegedly received \u00a311,500 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was mayor and a \u00a315,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs in Britain.\n\nArcuri insisted the pair never discussed sponsorship or grants and Mr Johnson had had nothing to do with an additional \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to her company by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in January.\n\nThere were questions raised in the Commons about the due diligence made on the grant approval after ministers justified awarding the money - meant to be spent on improving IT skills in the UK - because the company had a British phone number.\n\nCalls to the number were answered by workers based in California, where Ms Arcuri, 34, is said to be based.\n\nThe culture committee will question the Secretary of State in the House of Commons at the same time as City Hall proceedings are getting under way.\n\nMr Johnson has previously accused his 'old friends' in the Assembly of 'barking up the wrong tree' with their investigation.\n\nMs Arcuri, a former model, used an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain to deny reports that she received favouritism during his eight-year stint as mayor.\n\nJennifer Arcuri has insisted the pair's private life is private and said she never asked for, nor received, any favours\n\nThe businesswoman, who said she met Mr Johnson for the first time in October 2011, has refused to comment on whether they had a romantic relationship as well as a professional rapport.\n\nShe said: 'I think it's quite unfortunate that it becomes that a good friend, who has now been, you know, now I'm dragged into the middle of this horrific scandal, you know, and the answer that I'm going to give is now going to be weaponised against this man.\n\n'It's really categorically no-one's business what private life we had, or didn't have. But - and categorically more important - Boris never, ever gave me favouritism.\n\n'Never once did I ask him for a favour. Never once did he write a letter of recommendation for me. He didn't know about my asking to go to trips.'", "description": "In a shock move the London Assembly announced that the IOPC asked the body to suspend its investigation while the police watchdog probes possible misconduct in a public office.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/09/19778964-0-image-a-18_1571215815836.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
