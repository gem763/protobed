Well, she\u2019s finally back with her first new song in a decade.\n\nThe Emmy-nominated actress is taking a break from leaving you in a puddle every week on \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and returning to her roots as a singer. On Tuesday, Moore released her single \u201cWhen I Wasn\u2019t Watching\u201d and an accompanying music video off her forthcoming seventh album, which will arrive early next year on the Verve Forecast label.\n\n\u201cWhen I Wasn\u2019t Watching\u201d is Moore at her most authentic, bridging her pop influences and contemporary folk music tastes into an emotionally grounded but upbeat exploration of self-discovery.\n\n\u201cMy favorite version of me disappeared /Through longer days and shorter years,\u201d she sings on the track. \u201cSo where was I when this was going down?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of diving back into music after so much time and personal change was really intimidating to me for a while,\u201d she said in a statement to People about the song. \u201cBut then I finally realized: I\u2019m the only person who can make this move. It all has to start with me.\u201d\n\nMoore entered the pantheon of pop princesses with her 1999 debut album \u201cSo Real.\u201d She went on to release a handful of popular singles throughout the early aughts like \u201cCandy,\u201d \u201cI Wanna Be With You\u201d and \u201cIn My Pocket\u201d and five more albums that pushed her beyond the boundaries of bubblegum pop and into a more grounded, adult sound.\n\nHer sixth studio album, \u201cAmanda Leigh,\u201d which spawned the lead single \u201cI Could Break Your Heart Any Day of the Week\u201d in 2009 was the last we heard from Moore besides a 2017 cover of the Little Feat track \u201cWillin\u201d on the \u201cThis Is Us\u201d soundtrack.\n\nThe actor has previously credited her break from music to her tumultuous marriage to musician Ryan Adams, which lasted from 2009 to 2016, describing him as psychologically abusive in a New York Times report earlier this year alongside six other women with their own stories about Adams\u2019 allegedly manipulative behavior.\n\nMoore, who\u2019s since married Dawes frontman Taylor Goldsmith, said that \u201cmusic was a point of control\u201d in her relationship with Adams.\n\n\u201cI want to make music,\u201d she told the outlet at the time. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let Ryan stop me.\u201d\n\nAnd, if you are wanting, well, more from the singer-songwriter, she is reportedly set to drop another new single before the end of the year.", "description": "Love ALWAYS, Mandy.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d80e6b63b0000039fd5a4c4.png?cache=dum2mdbwmb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
