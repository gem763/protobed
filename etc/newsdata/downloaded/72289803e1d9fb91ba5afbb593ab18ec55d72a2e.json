They have been equal parts Japanese efficiency and overenthusiastic rugby fans.\n\nAs Rugby World Cup fever grips our nation in anticipation of a Springbok final against England, we thought it would be education to evaluate the vital role that car companies have played in Japanese rugby.\n\nRugby World Cup 2019 | Here are some of the cars driven by team captains\n\nIf you are a car enthusiast, Japan remains the most important geography outside of Germany.\n\nThe world\u2019s most valuable car company is Japanese (Toyota) and many legendary vehicles, past and present, are Japanese. The automotive industry is an anchor of Japan\u2019s economy, employing 6-million people and accounting for a significant percentage of GDP.\n\nIn the overlap between Japanese cultural and corporate life, the company is everything. Many Japanese spend their entire working lives with one company and as such, Japanese companies reward this loyalty with excellent benefits.\n\nSport and leisure activities are encouraged as part of the holistic Japanese lifestyle and if you are a car and rugby fan, you might notice that Japanese brands are big into their rugby.\n\nIn the current Top League, which is the first tier of Japanese domestic rugby, there are no less than five of the fourteen teams which are automotive related. These teams enjoy immense financial backing from their corporate naming sponsors and even have a few Springboks contracted to play.\n\nThe car company teams\n\nYou have the Honda Heat, founded as Honda\u2019s corporate rugby team way back in 1960. Current Springbok bomb squad lock, RG Snyman, plays for them. One of Japan\u2019s oldest teams, is the Toyota Verblitz, founded in 1941 and owned by the world\u2019s dominant car company by value, Toyota.\n\nWillie le Roux has been a star player for the Toyota Verblitz in Japanese domestic rugby.Although Yamaha recently suspended all automotive research and support engineering activity, the brand\u2019s proud history and extensive motorcycle product portfolio certainly qualify it as an entity of interest to rugby fans who are petrolheads.\n\nImage: Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images\n\nThe Yahama Jubilo tier one rugby team features a single South African World Cup squad player, openside flanker, Kwagga Smith.\n\nWe also have the simply magnificently named, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Sagamihara DynaBoars, which unfortunately don\u2019t have a single South African player in their current squad. Founded in 1950, the Hino Red Dolphins are a rugby playing corporate entity of Toyota\u2019s truck business, but they also currently lack a South African player in their team.\n\nWhy Rugby?\n\nYou might be wondering why corporate Japan, and its car companies, pour resources into funding their own professional rugby teams.\n\nThe answer is simple: honour.\n\nJapanese corporate culture values honesty and teamwork. Rugby as a sport, especially as it is practiced in Japan, extols both these values.\n\nImage: Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images\n\nRugby also retains its own code of conduct for players, and enforcement is strict, unlike soccer, where dramatic behaviour is tolerated, and match officials regularly abused.\n\nThe blend between amateur domestic players, many who work for the companies which own Japanese rugby teams, and overseas professionals, also highlight the values of diversity and global cooperation. Both of which are important for Japanese car companies, in their global profile and product reach.", "description": "Rugby is big in Japan and many car companies have their own professional teams.
