That's more true than ever with the recently announced iPhone 11 Pro, which features not just two, but three camera lenses. But for those of us still living with our older iPhones, there are camera settings that can help us take great shots, too.\n\nOne of the most useful is \"HDR,\" or \"High dynamic range.\" Enabling this setting can elevate an average photo to an extraordinary shot.\n\nHere's what the setting means, and how to make sure you're taking advantage of it.\n\nWhat HDR means on an iPhone\n\nHere's a common scenario: You want a shot of someone in front of a gorgeous outdoor backdrop, but doing so means they will be blasted with overly-bright backlighting.\n\nRather than having to choose between focusing on your subject and losing the background, or vice-versa, HDR makes it so you can experience both in one photograph.\n\nHow? By taking three photos consecutively at different exposures - one normal, and one each adjusted for the brightest and darkest details.\n\nThe end result: a final photo with the best of everything.\n\nOn older iPhones, you can set HDR manually by tapping its icon when you're taking a picture (as depicted below in step five). Newer models of iPhone, however, are automatically set to use HDR when deemed necessary, with a setting called \"Smart HDR.\"\n\nBut you can still manually control the feature. Here's how.\n\nHow to manually control HDR on iPhone X and 11 models\n\n1. Open your iPhone's Settings app.\n\n2. Search or select \"Camera.\"\n\nOverriding the automatic Smart HDR feature can be reassuring if you want to control which shots use HDR.\n\n3. Disable the slider for Smart HDR so it turns white.\n\n4. Close Settings and open your Camera.\n\nIf you remember older iPhone models, the HDR setting's new location at the top of your camera screen should be familiar.\n\n5. HDR will now appear as a setting in the top-left corner.\n\nThis lets you turn HDR on and off whenever you like. Just tap it when using your camera.", "description": "One of the most remarkable aspects of the iPhone is its powerful camera.
