To my knowledge, they are not even in the Oxford English Dictionary, yet they are on everyone\u2019s lips day in, day out.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed by now. Brexit and VAR (video assistant referee). Brexit doesn\u2019t really concern us for this column. But the VAR certainly does.\n\nAs you all know by now, VAR was brought in a short time ago to try to ensure that the game was played to the letter and that justice was not only done, but seen to be done.\n\nThe doubters at the time would appear to be vindicated by the amount of discussion on its use and, in some instances, their downright opposition to it.\n\nWe first had goal line technology. That seemed to go quite well. The referee wore a gadget similar to a wristwatch that indicated to him within seconds whether the whole ball had crossed the goal line or not. Okay, so far so good.\n\nThen along came the VAR, and it has caused nothing but trouble since its inception.\n\nThere are only four instances at the moment when the VAR will be used when there is a \u201cclear and obvious error\u201d or \u201cserious missed incident\u201d in relation to:\n\nGoal/no goal;\n\nPenalty/no penalty;\n\nDirect red card (not second yellow card/caution); and\n\nMistaken identity (when the referee cautions or sends off the wrong player of the offending team).\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand from the outset that only the referee can initiate a \u201creview\u201d; the VAR (and other match officials) can only recommend a \u201creview\u201d to the referee.\n\nThe final decision is always made by the referee, either based on information from the VAR or after the referee has undertaken an \u201con-field review\u201d.\n\nThe protocols state quite clearly that, during the review process or when the final decision is made, players and team officials must not surround or attempt to influence the referee when the decision is reviewed.\n\nNow, my main reason for concentrating this week on the VAR is because there have been so many inconsistencies in the Premier League of late.\n\nJust last weekend, two such incidents came very much tothe fore.\n\nIn the Manchester United versus Liverpool game, Sadio Man\u00e9 thought he\u2019d got the first goal for Liverpool, but it was ruled out as a hand ball.\n\nIn this situation (and this is the new interpretation), the ball brushed against Man\u00e9\u2019s hand \u2013 remember, he did not influence the flight of the ball by his action \u2013 which was reviewed and the goal was disallowed.\n\nThis was the correct decision by referee Martin Atkinson.\n\nIn the second incident, Dele Alli of Tottenham Hotspur clearly used the top part of his arm (near the shoulder) to guide the ball down to his foot, from which he scored against Watford. In this instance, the referee didn\u2019t even consult the VAR monitor.\n\nIn my opinion, this was a clear and obvious error on the part of the referee. The goal was allowed to stand.\n\nThe main issue appears to be inconsistency among the referees, and this can only lead to debate and even confrontation that isunnecessary.\n\nI\u2019ve heard it said many times that all that is required is consistency. It seems as if the only thing that is consistent at the moment is the inconsistency of match officials.\n\nPlease feel free to make comments or ask questions.\n\nHappy whistling!", "description": "There are two words or abbreviations doing the rounds in Europe.
