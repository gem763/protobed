In order for Trudeau to maintain power, his Liberals must win the most ridings, or electoral districts, and the margin of victory will influence the form the next government takes \u2014 whether it's a majority or a minority arrangement.\n\nHere\u2019s a five-step primer on how Canadian federal elections work:\n\nStep 1: The Declaration\n\nThis step marks the formal start of the campaign. It's what happened on Wednesday when Trudeau, in his capacity as prime minister, visited Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Canadian representative, Governor General Julie Payette, to ask that she dissolve Parliament.\n\nLawmakers had actually departed Ottawa in June, but Payette formally shut down Parliament and issued writs of election for each electoral district, giving MPs and their challengers the green light to hit the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nStep 2: The Campaign\n\nTrudeau, Scheer and the leaders of other national parties will tour the country, making the case for their party. At the same time, incumbents and challengers will compete in the 338 separate elections for Commons seats.\n\nNumerous political parties will field candidates for Commons seats, including national organizations like the New Democratic Party and the Green Party of Canada, and several lesser-known and regional parties.\n\nThe largest regional party is a separatist party in French-speaking Quebec, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which is a player in numerous local races and has frequently won a majority of the province\u2019s seats.\n\nNearly three-quarters of Commons seats are concentrated in just three populous provinces: Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. The performance of regional party candidates in races in these provinces could play a decisive role in the overall election outcome.\n\n\n\nSeveral times during the campaign, party leaders will meet for televised debates in English and French. Aside from the usual stump speeches, rallies and political ads, the campaign also has a significant focus on policy. National parties will make platform announcements on almost a daily basis, and they'll cap things off closer to the Oct. 21 vote by releasing a full platform that lists anticipated costs of their various policy pledges.\n\n\n\nStep 3: The Vote\n\nVoters can cast ballots at the polls, at advanced polling sites, at their local Elections Canada office or by mail. One member of Parliament is chosen for each Commons seat. (Canada's other chamber, the Senate, is not elected.)\n\nIn the 2015 election, five parties won Commons seats: the Liberals, who won the election; the Conservatives; the New Democrats; the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois; and the Green Party.\n\nSoon after the vote, the sitting prime minister will visit the governor general to discuss the election results.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Creating a new government\n\nHere's where things can really get interesting. The leader of the party that wins the most Commons seats usually gets first crack at forming a government and becoming prime minister, but it's not automatic.\n\nIf the victorious party wins a clear majority of seats, things are much more clean-cut. That party will have a clear mandate to control the executive branch, the cabinet and the federal departments, and also have a much easier time passing legislation.\n\nTrudeau's Liberals won a majority in 2015. Canada's elections have produced majority governments in slightly more than half of all contests since the 1960s.\n\nIf the winning party wins 169 seats or fewer, they will form a minority government. There are two ways this can happen. First, the winning party could seek to form a governing coalition with other parties. Second, and far more common, the winning party can work with other parties to pass bills on a case-by-case basis, depending on the issue.\n\nMinority government is messy and precarious. The government must constantly work to keep the support of the Commons, and can be toppled at any time. This scenario usually triggers another election within two years.\n\n\n\nStep 5: The throne speech\n\nOnce the government is formed, its control over Parliament faces a crucial, early test in what's called the throne speech. The speech, which is likely to take place in December, is written by the new government and outlines its priorities and policy plans. The Governor General reads it to Parliament, with members present.\n\nThe throne speech is like the State of the Union address the U.S. president delivers to Congress, but there\u2019s one massive difference: members of Parliament vote on the speech. The new government will collapse if it loses the vote, so this step can be perilous for a minority government.\n\nAnd if the new government loses the vote, either the opposition parties will band together to form a new government, or it's election time again.\n\n\u2014Graphic and illustrations by Cristina Rivero", "description": "How Canada elects a prime minister and Parliament.", "authors": ["Alexander Panetta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/23/d3/08ad42944af59dd39f566a4f4aa3/20190910-trudeau-looks-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
