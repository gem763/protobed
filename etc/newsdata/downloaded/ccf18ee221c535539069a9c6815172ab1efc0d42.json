The economic data shift says yes.\n\nThe U.S. side of the fence\n\nThere is one very good reason we should pay close attention to trade calming this time around as in the wake of the dismal manufacturing ISM reading in the U.S. this week, the economic cost of a trade war in U.S. voters eyes is rising quickly as the global manufacturing meltdown is now leaching into the U.S. manufacturing sector. Indeed, the weak manufacturing industry is not an ideal scenario for a run-up into the election year as the U.S. manufacturing sector is absolutely the chunk of the economy the President most wants to safeguard\n\nThe Chinese side of the fence\n\nChina trade data unambiguously confirms that softer global demand and U.S. tariffs continued to weigh on China\u2019s export growth while accelerating drop in imports reflects flagging domestic demand.\n\nConcerns of a more protracted trade war have already sapped business confidence in China. Regardless of which way you want to slice and dice the data at the end of the day it comes out bad, while the latest Chinese inflation data was the worst possible outcome and a policymaker\u2019s nightmare.\n\nOil Markets\n\nOil came under intense pressure on a report that President Trump was mulling easing sanctions on Iran \u2013 something Bolton pushed back on. WTI has now given back all the gains from earlier in the week on the story that Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman will assume the top spot in the Saudi Oil complex.\n\nHowever, temporarily plugging the oil market leak, the EIA inventory draw came out in line with API report. Crude stocks fell 6.9Mb, bullish vs consensus for a 2.7Mb draw and the 5-year average of -0.3Mb, and roughly in line with the 7.2Mb decline reported by the API yesterday.\n\nFundamental drivers all moved in a bullish direction with imports down and exports and refinery inputs up. With this week\u2019s decline inventories have dropped below the 5y average. Historical inventory patterns suggest that stocks should begin to hit seasonal bottom sometime in the next 2-3 weeks.\n\nThere are three good reasons prices should remain supported specifically OPEC compliance, inventory draw and a possible trade war detente; however, there are between 500,000 \u2013 700,000 reasons which suggest otherwise. Specifically, the approximate number of Iranian barrels that would flood the markets if US sanctions are lifted. Still, the closer we move to a trade war detent the higher oil prices will react.\n\nWe know the President wants Gasoline prices lower especially ahead of a what to be a hotly contested 2020 election. So, what better holiday Gift could the President offer up the US electorate than lower gasoline prices at the Pump.\n\nAmong the many gasoline-related conspiracy theories that flood the airwaves, there is the one that says national elections cause gasoline prices to fall. Prices do indeed tend to decline in the run-up to Election Day.", "description": "After two days with activity focussed in fixed income, there was a significant pivot on Wednesday. US treasuries were little changed, but US equities surged with S&P500; up 0.7%, and most bourses stronger through Europe as well which is set up for a positive day in Asia.", "authors": ["Stephen Innes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AJ4Gl0UtDn8lo.5LxsnnJA--~B/aD02MDQ7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/d44ee4e3c08e39a7ddc00f06853f9621", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
