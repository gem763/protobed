He received an eight-month suspended sentence and a 5,000-euro ($5,532) fine.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Princess Hessa called plumber Ashrad Eid to her apartment to fix a damaged sink. The craftsman said he took photos of the bathroom he needed for work, but the princess believed he was trying to photograph her when she saw her reflection captured in the mirror. Eid alleged the princess furiously ordered her bodyguard to bind him and forced him to kiss the princess' feet, as well as break Eid's phone.\n\nThe plumber said he was not allowed to leave for several hours.
