Goldman Sachs was the only major U.S. bank trading lower after posting a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc was set to post its best day in more than a decade, while Johnson & Johnson shares eyed their biggest one-day percentage gain since January after both companies raised their profit forecasts.\n\nThe stocks were among the top boosts to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes, and lifted the S&P healthcare sector to a three-week high. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher.\n\n\u201cIf this earnings season turns out to be better than expected, we can end up with a scenario that there won\u2019t be pressure on the labor market and that keeps us away from a recession,\u201d said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.\n\nAnalysts have forecast the worst quarterly profit performance in about three years for S&P 500 companies, with industrials among those most at risk from the trade dispute.\n\nFor interactive graphic, click link: tmsnrt.rs/2IUwPLY\n\nWall Street has been rattled over the past 15 months by tit-for-tat tariffs by the United States and China, with the impact already reflecting in the domestic economy.
