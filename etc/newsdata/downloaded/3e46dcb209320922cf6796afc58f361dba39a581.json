So it can learn from Russia,\u201d Beijing-based military expert Zhou Chenming told the newspaper.\n\nThe Chinese fleet already possess nuclear-powered submarines. But the subs\u2019 reactors are poor candidates for transfer to a surface ship as large as an aircraft carrier. France learned that lesson a quarter-century ago, Zhou pointed out.\n\nIn a bid to cut costs in the development of the Charles de Gaulle \u2013 France\u2019s first and only nuclear-powered carrier \u2013 its designers used two K15 submarine pressurised water reactors as the main propulsion system. It did not work. The huge size of the vessel and the lack of power from the engines means it now has the unwanted title of being the world\u2019s slowest carrier, with a top speed of just 27 knots. Experts say carriers need to be able to hit at least 30 knots to create the headwinds necessary to launch their aircraft. \u201cThe combat capability of the Charles de Gaulle has been sharply reduced because of its low speed,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cIt was a painful lesson for the French.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "A real problem or a joke?", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JuXlheRgEkajhxpHq8NvXQ--~B/aD0xMTMzO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/ecb16b8b42852e8f60775bca67f3cb97", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
