Yes, I'm old,' he said.\n\nAccording to the biography on his now-private Twitter account, he was born in 1974.\n\nAnother academic, Dr Ben Britton, criticised his remark, writing on Twitter: 'Saying \"I'm old\" is a c**p excuse.\n\n'Either rationalise the defense of your position, or listen to the others talking. 'It's tradition' is weak, if the tradition is for tradition's sake.'\n\nThe exchange about women's clothes was prompted by another academic's discussion of the term 'black tie'.

Bernadette Moore, another academic, said: 'Yup... \"hooker\" classic example of judgement women face!'\n\nStudents said the academic's comments were 'sexist and inappropriate'.\n\nOn top of that, Dr Morris reportedly wrote that 'Boris was right' when discussing the PM's controversial comments about Muslim women looking like 'letterboxes'.\n\nHis exact status at Oxford is unclear and the university has previously denied he is a 'university or college academic'.\n\nHowever, he delivers training sessions in computer programming in Oxford's IT department and has previously taught statistics.\n\nA document published on his own blog previously described him as a 'college lecturer in statistics' at St Hilda's College.\n\nAnother online biography described him as a former senior developer at Microsoft.\n\nMailOnline has approached the university for comment.", "description": "Dr Peet Morris, a former statistics lecturer at St Hilda's College in Oxford, made the provocative comments in a tweet which has since been deleted.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/01/19519330-0-image-a-48_1570668203848.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
