They were countered by conservative voices who took the Washington Post to task for its changing headlines on the incident and the cynical takes on the operation by liberal voices.\n\nSome of the reactions:\n\nIt's Breath taking, Bernie Sanders Acknowledges \u2018Kurds and Other U.S. Allies\u2019 After al-Baghdadi Raid, Not U.S. Forces or Trump https://t.co/goezSAH3aA via @BreitbartNews \u2014 Chuck Woolery (@chuckwoolery) October 27, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP#alBaghdadi is FINALLY GONE! The Dems should be happy but they are mad @realDonaldTrump didn\u2019t tell them about the raid!#Baghdadi would have got away if Trump informed all the Democrats!

It\u2019s clear we got Baghdadi despite this C-I-C, not because of him. \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 27, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nI love pics of Trump trying to look like a hard man because you know he was thinking of the time Sharon Stone was rude to him or some shit https://t.co/GSXEuL2VQ9 \u2014 Ike Barinholtz (@ikebarinholtz) October 27, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSo obviously Trump is very, very stupid & a bigot & may even have neurosyphilis \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise his speech is a grease fire in a nursing home.
