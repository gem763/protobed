A lawmaker who was there says that\u2019s false.", "language": "en", "text": "On Thursday, Zuckerberg \u2014 under scrutiny for how misinformation is harnessed and is now protected by Facebook \u2014 bridged the debate over Iraq and the nexus of his company, even at one point suggesting the social network could have stopped the war entirely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently,\u201d Zuckerberg said at Georgetown University. \u201cThose early years shaped my belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time.\u201d\n\nGallego blasted Zuckerberg\u2019s recollection as an attempt to redraw the company\u2019s image as altruistic in the face of growing scrutiny, as it defends its decision to allow lies in political ads.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s rewriting history so it gives him an excuse to regulate himself,\u201d Rep. Gallego (D-Ariz.) told The Washington Post on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s false. It\u2019s completely false.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome bits of Zuckerberg\u2019s recollection were telling, said Gallego, who claims to be one of the first 2,000 users of Facebook, which in its earliest iterations was open only to Harvard students.\n\nEven in 2004, when a version that roughly resembled the site was launched, none of the features allowed users to communicate, organize or debate something like the Iraq War, Gallego said.\n\nAnd the debate had no reason or inkling to move online. It was a robust machine all over campus. \u201cThe two never really intertwined,\u201d Gallego, who then went by Ruben Marinelarena, said of Iraq discussions and Facebook, expressing doubts that Zuckerberg then had visions of harnessing online discussion when blogs were only beginning to become prominent avenues of online expression.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNicholas Thompson, the editor of Wired, said Zuckerberg\u2019s claims were part of a larger recasting of the company\u2019s challenges \u2014 how and whether it should regulate speech or ban political misinformation \u2014 as part of its self-described dedication to free expression.\n\n\u201cHe reframes the whole history of the company,\u201d Thompson told CBS News.\n\nA spokesman for Facebook did not return a request for comment.\n\nGallego, a government student in 2003, shipped off to Japan after his orders changed, he said, and he returned to campus to finish his last semester in 2004.\n\nHe served a combat tour in Iraq as an infantryman the next spring, just as Facebook took its initial steps toward becoming the social media juggernaut it is now.\n\nAD\n\nBut Gallego and Zuckerberg are in vastly different places now. Gallego sits in Congress, where lawmakers are split along party lines about how they view Facebook and how they might regulate it. That comes as 46 attorneys general investigate the company for possible antitrust violations.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Zuckerberg wants it both ways, Gallego said: to appease Republicans who believe social networks stifle conservative speech and to market himself as part of a liberal resistance.\n\nFacebook and other social networks are not federally regulated like radio and television broadcasts, and Gallego said it\u2019s the preference of congressional colleagues to keep it that way.\n\nAD\n\nBut, he said, \u201cif they\u2019re not going to be responsible with their platform, maybe they will have to come under the responsibility of one of those governing bodies.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Rep.
