The GOP\u2019s margin of control in both houses of the state legislature is only one seat.\n\nBut in a post-Trump electoral landscape, where the blue wave of 2017 and 2018 saw more progressive candidates succeed, the GOP is facing a more liberal electorate. So a number of the state\u2019s Republican incumbents are trying a novel strategy: running as moderates, and actively campaigning against their own previous votes and views.\n\nThe success of that strategy will have repercussions far beyond the next session. If the Republicans lose the state\u2019s House of Delegates and Senate on Nov. 5, the Democrats will oversee the post-census redistricting process and redraw the maps that Republicans gerrymandered a decade ago.\n\nChanging The GOP\u2019s Tunes\n\nIn the last election cycle, health care was a major campaign platform for first-time Democratic candidates like Danica Roem. Those who were elected to Virginia\u2019s General Assembly fought successfully to pass Medicaid expansion. Now Republicans who voted against that expansion are running on making health care more accessible and affordable.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Glen Sturtevant is pushing ads focused on how health care \u201cshouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue\u201d and why coverage for people with preexisting conditions is important. Sturtevant only narrowly won his seat in 2015 and his district has moved further left since then \u2015 60% of voters backed U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D) in the 2018 midterm elections. Sturtevant\u2019s ad portrays him as a moderate on health care when, in reality, he voted against the Medicaid expansion law that made thousands of Virginians eligible.\n\nFellow Republican state Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant ran a deeply conservative campaign to get elected in 2015, in which she promised to oppose any expansion of the Affordable Care Act. Like Sturtevant, she voted against the Medicaid expansion and is now running on a platform for affordable health care.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just health care on which Republicans are trying to change their tune. Gun control is a particularly pressing issue: Just five months ago, a gunman opened fire at a Virginia Beach municipal center, killing 12 and injuring 4. Voters on both sides of the aisle said it was their biggest concern this election cycle, according to a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll. A huge majority of Virginia voters \u2015 almost 90% \u2015 support expanding background checks, and a smaller majority support a ban on assault weapons.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are energized on this issue as well. After the Virginia Beach shooting, when Gov. Ralph Northam (D) tried to hold a special legislative session on gun safety measures, Republican lawmakers quashed any gun control-related legislation. Democratic candidates say they\u2019re committed to reversing that result if they\u2019re elected.\n\nMany of the Republicans voted out of office in 2017 had \u201cA\u201d ratings from the National Rifle Association and were vehemently pro-gun. So in 2019, flaunting ties to the NRA is notably less popular.\n\n\u201cAn \u2018A\u2019 rating from the NRA is now a liability,\u201d argued Grant Fox, communications director for the Democratic Party of Virginia.\n\nRepublicans with strong anti-gun control voting records are presenting themselves as moderate on the issue. Dunnavant, for example, recently released an ad in which she says she supports a federal ban on bump stocks \u2015 even though she voted against a bump stock ban in the state assembly last year. \u201cAnything short of a federal ban would be ineffective because it was easy to bring a bump stock across state lines,\u201d her campaign manager, Marshall Moreau, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.\n\nRepublican state Del. Tim Hugo has served in the assembly for 16 years, earning himself an \u201cA\u201d NRA rating and working with fellow Republicans to halt any legislation after the Virginia Beach massacre. He\u2019s now backpedaling, as the Washington Post editorial board pointed out in August, and saying that he supports a \u201cred flag\u201d bill that would keep guns out of the hands of people at risk of doing harm to others or themselves.\n\nSome Democrats are trying to highlight these election-inspired conversions. \u201cA handful of candidates might pretend to be moderate, but they never really have to vote [on the issues] because their party kills the bills,\u201d said Matt Harringer, national press secretary for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to state legislatures. \u201cVoters get that,\u201d he said. \u201cVoters see that.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party of Virginia declined to comment on campaign strategy.\n\nProminent Democrats Weigh In\n\nVirginia has been leaning more and more Democratic since the election of President Donald Trump, according to Kyle Kondik, managing editor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. The Democratic surge in the 2017 election \u2015 almost but not quite winning the majority in the House \u2015 bodes well for the party\u2019s chances in next week\u2019s election.\n\nThe state Senate wasn\u2019t on the ballot two years ago. But this year, the entire legislature is up for election. That means, with Northam already in the governor\u2019s mansion, this is the best chance that Democrats have had in a long time to gain control of all three governing bodies in the state.\n\nKondik pointed to one way Trump may be tilting the balance against his party: \u201cIt used to be that white-collar professionals with four-year degrees were a better voting bloc for Republicans, and they are also more likely to vote. But that group has been trending Democratic, particularly after Trump.\u201d\n\nBut Kondik also noted, \u201cIt\u2019s competitive and the Republicans are hoping they can knock off a few of these incumbents.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Virginia GOP is using a myriad of campaign strategies, the best chance they have of keeping a hold on the House of Delegates and the Senate in this increasingly blue state is low voter turnout. It\u2019s an off-off-year election, meaning there is no national election and no statewide contests to bring out the voters. In 2017, which was merely an off-year election (no national voting but the governorship and other top statewide posts were up for grabs), just over 2.5 million Virginians voted. But in 2018, almost 3.5 million people turned out to vote in the national midterms.\n\nLow voter turnout has historically benefited the GOP, Kondik said, and Virginia Republicans will be banking on it again next week.\n\nIt\u2019s bad news for the GOP, then, that several Democratic presidential candidates have been knocking on doors throughout the state to encourage people to vote next Tuesday.\n\nMANDEL NGAN via Getty Images Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren shares the stage with Virginia Del.
