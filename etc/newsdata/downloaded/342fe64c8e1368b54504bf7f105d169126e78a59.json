It was a lot of fun. He loved it.\u2019\n\nHarry and Meghan were chatting to Milly Sutherland, 11, and her mother Angela from Liverpool.\n\nThe 50-year-old said: \u2018She took him to one of these baby classes today and she said they had loads of fun together. She said it was really good fun.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mum and daughter asked the couple whether Archie has red hair.\n\nMilly\u2019s mother said: \u2018Meghan said he has and Harry said he definitely is, you can see it in his eyebrows.\n\nWe are very excited to announce that we will be broadcasting the 2019 #WellChildAwards, in association with @gsk, LIVE on Facebook.

They\u2019re royals, you kind of have to do what they say.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
