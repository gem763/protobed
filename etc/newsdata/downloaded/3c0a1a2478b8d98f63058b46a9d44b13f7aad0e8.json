In 2018/19, there were 1.78million recouping \u00a3485million.\n\nSean McCann, financial planner at NFU Mutual, said: \u201cMore and more people are capitalising on the Marriage Allowance but there will still be people out there unaware of this potential rebate that could be worth more than \u00a31,000.\u201d\n\nThis is one of a number of tax benefits available to married couples and civil partners that co-habiting couples miss out on.\n\nOthers include the ability to pass assets to each other free of inheritance tax on death, and the ability to gift assets to each other without triggering a capital gains tax charge.\n\nDespite these benefits, the number of marriages in England & Wales has been on a steady decline since 1972, when there were 426,000 ceremonies. Latest figures show there were just 243,000 in 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of co-habiting couples has increased 25.8% in the past decade from 2.7million to 3.4million.\n\nBut by the end of the year, they'll all be able to apply for Civil Partnerships , giving an extra 3million people greater financial security.\n\nThe move, an extension of the original Civil Partnerships Act 2004, will give millions of unmarried, cohabiting couples, equal rights on savings, tax, and pensions benefits as those who wed in a traditional ceremony.\n\nIt also means they won't have to foot the \u00a327,000 average cost of a wedding, which thousands simply cannot afford.\n\nUnder the changes, cohabiting couples who decide not to marry will be given the option to tie the knot in a speedy, paper agreement instead.\n\nIt was first announced last year under plans to equalise the law , after the Supreme Court ruled that a ban on it was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.", "description": "This is in the form of the \u00a3250 marriage tax allowance, a benefit which unmarried couples cannot access because they're not legally binding in the eyes of the law", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10302227.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PROD-Amazing-Bride-and-Groom-Kissing-Wedding-Dress-Flowers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
