(AP) - Sean McVay didn\u2019t hold back Monday, harshly criticizing the Rams\u2019 offensive play-caller for a series of bad selections in the red zone during Los Angeles\u2018 27-9 win over New Orleans .\n\nSince McVay calls all of the Rams\u2019 plays himself, he feels pretty confident his target will take the criticism in the right way.\n\n\u201cWe had some patches in there offensively where we didn\u2019t finish in the red zone, and there were some really poor decisions on my part that really there\u2019s no excuse (for),\u201d McVay said. \u201cThere were just poor decisions, especially on the third down when we end up throwing the screen to (tight end) Gerald (Everett). That\u2019s a bad design, bad idea. There\u2019s really no way of running around that one.\u201d\n\nOnce McVay finishes critiquing himself, he\u2019ll get back to work unlocking the potential resting in a team that has scored 57 points and played strong defense during a 2-0 start to the season.\n\nMcVay is already imagining what the Rams can do once their high-powered offense gets back into top form. Although the Rams have plenty to work on, they still haven\u2019t trailed this season.\n\nJared Goff\u2019s passing game hasn\u2019t blown up yet, failing to crack 270 yards in either game. While Goff has done enough to win both games, McVay expects more from an offense that racked up two of the most prolific seasons in NFL history to start his tenure.\n\nIn fact, the Rams got more than half of their 265 yards passing last Sunday on only two big plays: Brandin Cooks\u2019 spectacular over-the-head catch and Cooper Kupp\u2019s even-more-spectacular catch and run .\n\nCooks\u2019 catch dazzled McVay, the former Miami of Ohio receiver.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never caught something that long or that far down the field,\u201d McVay said with a laugh. \u201cFor Brandin to be able to find that ball, accelerate - and then you can see he actually caught the back tip of that, and then brought it back in before he went to the ground. Because if he didn\u2019t kind of regather it on his way down, it probably would have been one of those when it hits the ground it actually comes out. A lot of good things.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe Los Angeles defense is off to a superb start despite facing Cam Newton and the high-powered Saints in back-to-back weeks. The Rams are fifth in the NFL with just 293.5 yards per game allowed, and their pass defense is rated sixth in the league. Los Angeles and New England are the only teams that didn\u2019t allow a touchdown pass in the first two weeks of the season, and the Rams have allowed just one pass play longer than 20 yards - fewest in the NFL.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe offensive line will need every possible minute to prepare for a near future with three untested starters. Right guard Austin Blythe has a sprained left ankle, which could mean sixth-round pick Jamil Demby, who was waived and re-signed by Los Angeles last season, will make his first career start next to fellow second-year pros Bryan Allen and Joe Noteboom. No starting offensive lineman has missed a game due to injury in McVay\u2019s tenure in Los Angeles, but that could change this week.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nKupp has seamlessly reassumed a prominent role in the Rams\u2019 offense after missing the second half of last season with injury. He led Los Angeles with five catches for 120 yards against the Saints, and Goff targeted him nine times - three more than he targeted Cooks and Robert Woods combined.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nWoods was targeted only twice - down from 13 targets in Week 1 - and made just one jet sweep run against the Saints. He also had a 14-yard TD reception that was called back by a dubious illegal block penalty on Noteboom. Woods has been an invaluable component of McVay\u2019s offense, and it\u2019s nearly certain the Rams will work to get the dependable wideout more involved in the upcoming weeks.\n\nINJURED\n\nBlythe said his injury is a low ankle sprain, calling it a \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d and \u201cgood news.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll be out, but he\u2019s not even sure whether he\u2019ll have to miss the next game. TE Tyler Higbee left the game with a bruised lung that left him coughing up blood, but his condition is improving, McVay said. The Rams don\u2019t know how long Higbee will be out, either.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n2: The number of games this season in which the Rams\u2019 defense has forced a turnover on the opening drive. After linebacker Cory Littleton forced and recovered a fumble at Carolina, safety John Johnson intercepted a deflected pass by Drew Brees. McVay loves the tone-setting nature of this habit. The Rams have four takeaways in their first two games.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe first of at least five prime-time games for the defending NFC champions when they travel to Cleveland for a Sunday night showdown with the improved Browns. The Rams\u2019 early schedule looked fairly tough on paper, and this jaunt to Ohio will be their second long road trip already. Another win would put the Rams on course for a shot at matching last year\u2019s 8-0 start.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sean McVay didn't hold back Monday, harshly criticizing the Rams' offensive play-caller for a series of bad selections in the red zone during Los Angeles' 27-9 win over New Orleans .", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/saints_rams_football_83373_c0-130-3112-1944_s1770x1032.jpg?cc55a4ae52a65744755693c1ac0e8eadd8b0f1e7", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
