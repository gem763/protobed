Williams fell short in her bid to set her crowning achievement of matching Margaret Court with 24 Grand Slam championships. Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu beat the 37-year-old Williams 6-3, 7-5 on Saturday to win her first Grand Slam title.\n\nThe former Meghan Markle, who starred in the cable show \u201cSuits,\u201d sat in front of fashion influencer Anna Wintour and behind Williams\u2019 husband Alexis Ohanian.\n\nWintour wore her usual dark shades and did not crack a smile when she was shown on the big screen as \u201cVogue\u201d by Madonna blared through the stadium. Meghan smiled and waved to a cheering crowd as she was billed on the screen as \u201cHRH The Duchess of Sussex.\u201d The Dutchess wore a belted denim long-sleeve dress and headlined the A-list starpower that attended the final: Spike Lee, Andy Cohen and Taraji P. Henson were among the bold names in the stands.\n\nWilliams\u2019 coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said he talked a little tennis with the Duchess before the match.\n\n\u201cBut I know her from before,\u201d she was famous, he said with a smile.\n\nMeghan struck out as serving as a good-luck charm. She was Briefcase Model No. 24 - the number of slams Williams was trying to reach - when she appeared on the TV show \u201cDeal or No Deal.\u201d\n\nWhile her appearance at Flushing Meadows sparked a media blitz, the royal family is a constant presence at Wimbledon.\n\n_____\n\nSHE THE NORTH\n\nBianca Andreescu has a U.S. Open title and a slogan inspired by fellow Canadian champions, the Toronto Raptors.\n\nShe the North .\n\nHer proud father, Nicu pulled out a red hat with the phrase emblazoned on the front.\n\nFirst the Raptors, \u201cnow Bianca,\u201d Nicu said.\n\nNicu and his wife, Maria, became a bit of sensation during the Open. Maria usually wears black sunglasses and came to one match holding the family, Coco, on her lap.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep it cool, to be grounded and we try to do the same with Bianca so she\u2019s well grounded and she knows that more will come,\u201d Nicu said.\n\nBianca gave an emotional thank you from the court to her parents and climbed a ladder to hop in the stands for hugs with family and friends.\n\nHer parents gave Bianca a pre-match pep talk - but Nicu refused to spill his championship words of wisdom.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a secret, sorry,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Raptors adopted the \u201cWe the North\u201d slogan on their way to the NBA championship.\n\n__\n\nThe U.S. Open mixed doubles champions are ready to cash some of the same check amounts as the other doubles winners.\n\nBethanie Mattek-Sands and Jamie Murray successfully defended their U.S. Open mixed doubles championships, then stumped for a bump in prize money. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s U.S. Open doubles champions win $740,000 (split between the partners) while the mixed doubles champs share $160,000.\n\n\u201cI actually think it should be closer,\u201d Mattek-Sands said. \u201cMixed doubles is an undervalued tennis product. You have guys and girls playing on the same level, no handicaps. The guys aren\u2019t feeling bad for the girls. The girls pick on the guys. It\u2019s generally amazing tennis out there. We have great points. Guys and girls together, not too many sports say they do that.\u201d\n\nMurray, one of the stars of doubles play, was ready for increased prize money.\n\n\u201cI think doubles is kind of the bedrock of the amateur game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of our sport. I think it definitely has the potential to offer greater value to these tournaments than perhaps it currently is or currently allowed to.\u201d\n\nMattek-Sands and Murray are the first team to defend a U.S. Open mixed doubles title since Kevin Curren and Anne Smith in 1981 and 1982. Murray became the first man in the Open era to win three straight mixed doubles titles in Flushing Meadows after starting the run in 2017 with Martina Hingis.\n\nMurray won his fifth Grand Slam mixed doubles title and Mattek-Sands won her third.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making him drink some champagne out of the trophy. We\u2019re having some pizza,\u201d Mattek-Sands said.\n\n_____\n\nRATINGS BUMP\n\nESPN says TV ratings are up at the Open.\n\nThe men\u2019s semifinals Friday earned a 1.2 overnight rating, up 20% from a 1.0 year ago. ESPN is averaging a 1.0 overnight rating overall across ESPN and ESPN2, up 25% from a 0.8 at this point last year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has another role that suits her: rooting on friend Serena Williams as the tennis star chased a U.S. Open championship.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Gelston"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/us_open_tennis_96173_c0-260-5116-3242_s1770x1032.jpg?27c470e313967b239e61b91ec0bdecb4a9ca9c08", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
