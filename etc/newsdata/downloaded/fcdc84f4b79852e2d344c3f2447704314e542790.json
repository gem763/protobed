Each candidate knew it might be their last night on a debate stage \u2013 and for many of them it definitely will be. This naturally led to fiery exchanges.\n\nPete Buttigieg attacked Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for her support of President Donald Trump\u2019s removal of troops from Northern Syria. Elizabeth Warren attacked Joe Biden on many of his past positions, including his initial support of the Iraq War.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris flailed at everyone. At one point she tried to convince Warren \u2013 the new frontrunner \u2013 to join her in calling for Twitter to delete President Trump\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d was the answer she got back.\n\nBut more importantly, this debate was the first time the \u201cmoderates\u201d truly went on the attack against the progressives, chiefly Warren.\n\nHealth care and taxes defined the night. Warren was on the defensive for refusing over and over to give a straight answer about whether \u201cMedicare For All\u201d will raise taxes on the middle class.\n\nEach answer was like the first:\n\n\"Costs will go up for the wealthy, they will go up for big corporations and for middle-class families, they will go down,\" she explained. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\"\n\nButtigieg immediately attacked her for dodging: \"Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in,\" he said.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar spent the entire night rebutting Warren\u2019s ideas, especially Medicare For All. The midwesterner rightfully called them \u201cpipe dreams\u201d that cost too much money.\n\nIn fact a report released Wednesday by the left-leaning Urban Institute said Medicare For All would require a $32 trillion tax increase.\n\nEven taxing \u201cthe rich\u201d was surprisingly controversial. Andrew Yang attacked Senator Warren\u2019s wealth tax, pointing out how similar proposals have already been tried and abandoned by Germany, France, and Denmark.\n\nBut Warren wasn\u2019t the only progressive to take fire. Pete Buttigieg called Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s support of gun confiscation a \u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from universal background checks and red flag laws, both of which he argued are more attainable.\n\nAs the primary continues, these attacks will only become more common. The reason for this is obvious: desperation. With time running out and polling requirements becoming stricter, candidates need to differentiate themselves quickly.\n\nMost candidates are trying to do this by sprinting as far left as possible, with Beto saying churches should lose tax-exempt status for believing in traditional marriage and Harris trying to get Trump\u2019s Twitter account shut down. Earlier in the race Castro tried the same thing by pushing for the decriminalization of all border crossings. Castro, Harris, and Beto have all seen this strategy blow up in their faces, creating more far more backlash than support.\n\nEven worse, progressives don\u2019t seem to care. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and other progressive representatives endorsed Bernie Sanders, cementing progressive support for the 78-year old senator.\n\nAll of this means that going left is not a viable option, especially considering how extreme the Democratic Party has already gone. Moving rhetorically away from the far left seems to be the best way for candidates to distinguish themselves.\n\nIn addition, Biden\u2019s numbers are slipping. A bombshell report by CNN based on campaign filings shows that Biden only has $9 million left in his account, a fraction of his rivals. He has spent more money than he raised for the third month in a row \u2013 painting a picture of a candidate who simply doesn't inspire people, at least not enough for them to open their wallets. Sanders, on the other hand, has over $30 million.\n\nIf he fizzled out, where would Biden\u2019s supporters go? That\u2019s a question Klobuchar and Buttigieg hope to answer. If they can present themselves as defenders of capitalism they would almost certainly get a chunk of Biden\u2019s support.\n\nLast night\u2019s debate was the first shot in a war that\u2019s been simmering for a year. No matter how many times she calls them \"Republican talking points\" Warren will be forced to address concerns from her more moderate counterparts about her desire to tax the middle class.\n\nEmmanuel Sessegnon is a communications associate at Americans for Tax Reform.", "description": "Wednesday\u2019s\u00a0Democratic primary debate had more in common with a food .10/17/2019 1:15:26AM EST.", "authors": ["Emmanuel Sessegnon", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/8eb88335-c327-49a8-bf8d-01f45d2db63d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
