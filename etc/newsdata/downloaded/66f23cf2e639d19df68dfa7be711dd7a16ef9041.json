They will be the subject of a rally outside City Hall Tuesday, followed by a hearing, where some of the anchorwomen from NY1 are expected to testify.\n\n\u201cI think more and more older adults are staying in the workplace and in large part it\u2019s because they have to work, right? You can\u2019t survive just on your Social Security and some of them don\u2019t even have pensions,\u201d Chin said in an interview on the subject earlier this year. \u201cSenior and older adults are still part of the future.\u201d\n\nOne bill would require the city\u2019s Commission on Human Rights to conduct at least five investigations into age discrimination each year for three years and report its findings to the Council. Of the 193 age-related inquiries the commission fielded last year, 119 related to workplace discrimination, Chin\u2019s office said.\n\nAnother bill would create a new city office to help seniors obtain jobs through training and assistance programs.\n\nIn a nationwide survey conducted in 2017, the AARP found 61 percent of workers age 45 and older experienced some type of age discrimination.\n\nThe issue persists as life expectancy improves and workers find themselves budgeting their finances for a longer retirement.\n\nThat puts an expensive city like New York off limits for Regina Matson, a Manhattan native who turned 60 years old last month and has been unable to land a job. She described the downward spiral of her life over the past decade, after she and many colleagues were laid off from Morgan Stanley following the recession in 2008.\n\nMatson was working as a vice president when she was laid off 11 years ago, prompting her to move with her 10-year-old daughter to Connecticut. There she worked odd jobs as she tried to piece her career back together. She assisted an interior designer, began a farmer\u2019s market and wrapped Christmas presents to earn money. She even sold her engagement ring.\n\nShe eventually found work again in the financial field where she once thrived, securing temporary consulting contracts until landing a permanent job with Thomson Reuters in 2015. But over the course of her two-and-a-half years there, she said she was the subject of jokes about her age and was eventually fired for reasons she believes are rooted in age discrimination. To date, she is still unemployed and said she applied for seven jobs Monday morning.\n\nMatson said her 30-something-year-old colleagues made fun of her for using an AOL email account and teased that at 56, she was old enough to be the mother of a new hire.\n\n\u201cI became like a joke. It was really, really, apparent that everybody else was a lot younger. And all of a sudden I became someone who was incompetent in their eyes,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she was left out of important meetings with lucrative new clients and passed over for assignments before eventually being let go. She was told the company was eliminating her job and said she received five months of severance pay.\n\n\u201cI feel like my life has disappeared,\u201d Matson said. \u201cI\u2019m an outgoing person. I\u2019ve always been gainfully employed. I\u2019m not used to being a failure.\u201d\n\nShe has survived on Social Security and some money from an older brother, who is in a nursing home dealing with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. She said her college-aged daughter resents her for their financial hardships and barely speaks to her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pervasive, the ageism, and you don\u2019t even realize it at first,\u201d she said. \u201cYou lose yourself.\u201d\n\nThe federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act begins protecting workers and job applicants from age discrimination at 40 years old \u2014 the age of Amanda Farinacci, the youngest plaintiff in the NY1 lawsuit. The Staten Island reporter told the New York Times she was excluded from moderating a town hall on Hurricane Sandy, a topic she covered extensively.\n\n\"This is career-ending, these opportunities that we\u2019re not getting,\u201d she said when the lawsuit, which also alleges gender discrimination, was filed in June.\n\nChin\u2019s other bills would create a task force to study age discrimination and come up with policy recommendations within one year and require the city to display posters about the issue in agency offices and online.\n\nBobbie Sackman, a longtime advocate for senior citizens who is now part of a group called Radical Age Movement, plans to testify Tuesday that the average age of a city worker is likely verging on 50 years old.\n\n\u201cThe time is now to confront age discrimination in the workplace,\u201d she plans to say, according to her testimony. \u201cNew York City has an opportunity to be a national leader by legislating that this is not how we do business here.\u201d", "description": "The issue persists as life expectancy improves and workers find themselves budgeting their finances for a longer retirement.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e5/e8/d07a21774e64b177f43b6622c523/margaretchin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
