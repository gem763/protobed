They said they do that and give contestants hypnotherapy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarburton added: \u2018I\u2019m not doing it but I say this now\u2026 but next year you\u2019ll all be voting for me and I\u2019ll be looking back thinking, \u201cI wish I had never mentioned it\u201d.\u2019\n\nHe retired aged 29 after winning 79 Test caps for Wales, holding the record for most caps as captain.\n\nThe married father-of-one said he did not live a \u2018celebrity\u2019 lifestyle and enjoyed being able to take his dog out for a walk, see his friends and family and go for a curry at his local Indian restaurant.\n\nMORE: Inside PewDiePie and Marzia Kjellberg\u2019s Japanese getaway as they enjoy second honeymoon\n\nMORE: Rami Malek who?
