The move is expected to open up around $7 billion of US exports to Japan, and Trump has reassured Abe that the US won\u2019t impose the \u2018section 232\u2019 national security tariffs on Japanese cars and auto parts.\n\nRBNZ Governor Orr hit the wires, saying rates are to remain low \u201cfor a number of years\u201d and they\u2019re unlikely to need unconventional policy tools. This follows on from similar comments from RBA\u2019s Governor Lowe, who said in a speech that whilst they doubt they\u2019ll use QE, they know how to use it if they have to.\n\nRBNZ Governor Orr hit the wires, saying rates are to remain low \u201cfor a number of years\u201d and they\u2019re unlikely to need unconventional policy tools. This follows on from similar comments from RBA\u2019s Governor Lowe, who said in a speech that whilst they doubt they\u2019ll use QE, they know how to use it if they have to. Orr\u2019s QE comment helped lift NZD, which is today\u2019s strongest major. NZD/JPY, NZD/USD, and NZD/CAD are the biggest gainers and close to reaching their typical daily ranges. AUD/NZD and GBP/NZD are the day\u2019s biggest losers.\n\nUSD trades lower for the session, with DXY in a narrow range just off yesterday\u2019s breakout highs. EUR/USD has pared losses yet remain firmly below 1.10. GBP/USD remains trapped below 1.24 and trades just off-of yesterday\u2019s lows which closed below key support.\n\nAsia Cash Indices % Change\n\n\n\nData from Refinitiv. Index names may not reflect tradable instruments, and not all markets are available in all regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity Brief:\n\nAsian equities gapped higher and took Wall Street\u2019s lead initially, although most have pared gain as they attempt to fill said gaps. The US-Japan trade agreement hasn\u2019t filtered through to sentiment, which is probably due to it \u2018limited\u2019 status with no solid agreement over autos.\n\nThe ASX200 has fallen to a 5-day low, led by the communication services, utility, and health care sector. Gold road, Silverlake, Newcrest and North Star (gold miners) are currently the four largest decliners, taking their bearish lead from lower gold prices overnight.\n\nUS futures are ticking slightly lower, yet structurally the cash indices look supported after rebounding off of key support levels overnight.\n\nEvent Calendar 2019\n\nUp Next\n\nNo major economic data points, although a few central bankers will hit the wires.\n\nPresident Draghi speaks at 14:30 GMT at a conference in Frankfurt (along with other EU central bankers) although we\u2019re not expecting fireworks with this one.\n\nGerman GF consumer confidence is expected to hold steadily optimistic at 9.7, although the index appears to have topped in 2017 and traders are more alarmed with the negative sentiment among German businesses. Still, a notable deterioration in consumer sentiment will be seen as the final nail in the coffin for their economy.\n\nUS Final GDP is unlikely to deviate too far away from the prior two reads, although expect carnage for the USD if it is revised heavily lower. Jobless claims warrant a look after hitting fresh multi-decade lows but, again we\u2019d need to see a notable miss for it to impact markets.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
