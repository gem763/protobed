At this time we do not plan to invoke Temporary Protected Status for those currently in the United States,\u201d the official said.\n\nTPS has also been a target of the White House, which has sought to terminate the program for migrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan.\n\nAt least 50 people died when Dorian made landfall, and Bahamian officials said on Wednesday that 2,500 people have been registered as missing in the wake of thedisaster. They cautioned the full list of missing has not been checked to see if any of those people are in shelters.\n\n\u201cThis list has not yet been checked against government records of who are staying in shelters or who have been evacuated,\u201d the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) spokesman, Carl Smith, told a press conference. \u201cThe database processing is under way.\u201d\n\n'You can smell death': Treasure Cay questions how to rebuild after Dorian Read more\n\nWhile power has returned to much of Grand Bahama, the electrical infrastructure around Marsh Harbour, Abaco\u2019s largest city, was destroyed.\n\nSeveral hundred people who evacuated the damaged islands are already living in emergency tents around Nassau, the capital. Many more are in gymnasia and other temporary shelters.\n\nOfficials are planning to erect two \u201ctent city\u201d relief centers capable of housing about 4,000 people around hard-hit Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco Island, said John Michael-Clark, co-chairman of the Bahamas disaster relief and reconstruction committee.\n\nThe two centers, one to the north of the town, the other to the south, will provide temporary housing to people who wish to rebuild their homes on the island, he said. Officials estimated that 90% of the homes and buildings in Marsh Harbour were damaged or destroyed by Dorian\u2019s top sustained winds of 185mph.\n\nAbout 15,000 people are still in need of shelter or food, according to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency. About 5,000 have been evacuated from the hardest-hit islands, which include Abaco, and another 6,000 to 7,000 remain there, according to a report shared by the UN World Food Program on Wednesday.", "description": "Officials say 2,500 people registered as missing but list has not been checked against shelter records", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe7a86270ad86118ca93bb8f55b1a07888d2684/0_87_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdc0eef9ff87ef70e1ff7fa5a4b2a2cf", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
