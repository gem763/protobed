It also followed a private meeting on Wednesday between Attorney General William Barr and Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox News\u2019 parent company.\n\nSmith recalled how he has been with Fox News since its inception, traveled the world, and \u201cwitnessed and reported on the events that shaped our reality.\u201d In what could be seen as a veiled reference to Trump\u2019s attacks, Smith said he aimed to \u201cspeak truth to power, without fear or favor, in context and with perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven in our currently polarized nation,\u201d Smith said, \u201cit\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day,that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will thrive.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s 3 p.m. show -- which is part of Fox\u2019s daily news coverage, not its evening opinion line-up -- scrutinized and fact-checked Trump in a way that often contrasted sharply with the reflexive defense of the president by the opinion hosts and their guests.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Trump took aim at Smith and a few others at Fox News in claiming the network \u201cdoesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore.\u201d That night, at a rally in Minneapolis, Trump praised more than a half-dozen supportive Fox News and Fox Business hosts, such as Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Lou Dobbs.\n\nThe network\u2019s efforts to cover the House impeachment inquiry and other fallout from Trump urging Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden has exposed divisions inside Fox News \u2013 and, at times, on-air. Smith and Carlson recently traded jabs after a guest on the latter\u2019s called senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d in response to his view that Trump committed a crime.\n\nNetwork president Jay Wallace described Smith in a prepared statement as \u201cone of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put Fox News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery,\u201d Wallace continued.\n\nSmith said he \u201cwon\u2019t be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future,\u201d under his agreement with Fox News. Meanwhile, rotating anchors will host the 3 p.m. slot until a new program is announced, the network said.", "description": "As President Donald Trump escalates his war of words with Fox News, one of his favorite targets at the network \u2013 managing editor for breaking news and 3 p.m. anchor Shepard Smith \u2013 announced he is leaving the network after 23 years.
