Get in touch: emma.munbodh@mirror.co.uk\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n\"It was frustrating that nobody had thought it appropriate to inform me that my card was under a block because this could have led to my embarrassment at the pump or the till if I had not had another means of payment with me.\"\n\nShe then contacted Nectar who advised her to contact Sainsbury's instead.\n\nHowever, after doing so, the supermarket said she should speak to Nectar, leaving her in limbo.\n\nShe eventually spoke to someone at Sainsbury's who said her Nectar account had been temporarily blocked because it was suspected that there had been fraud on some customers' accounts.\n\nKaren was then offered 1,000 points as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nHowever, her card remained blocked, with both parties unable to help.\n\n\"It should not take such an inordinate amount of time on the telephone and so many telephone calls to try to resolve this issue,\" Karen told This is Money .\n\nEventually she was told that her account had been permanently blocked and would not be reopened because the terms and conditions had not been adhered to.\n\nBoth parties still refused to provide a reason for the decision.\n\n\"I was initially grateful that my card was temporarily blocked in order to protect my account from suspected fraud, however, the manner in which this was done and the futile effort I have had to make to try to have the block lifted have been incredibly frustrating,\" she said.\n\nKaren said she was concerned, as she was waiting for the supermarket's double-up promotion later in the year to buy charity raffle prizes.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough she hasn't been informed as to the problem, Karen thinks she knows why her card might have been blocked.\n\nEarlier this year, Nectar was offering bonus points on purchases, for example, 40 points on the purchase of bananas so the purchase of a banana for about 10p would generate 40 points equating to 20p.\n\n\"I don't even like bananas \u2013 I was donating them to hostels and the homeless,\" she said.\n\n\"A pot of hot porridge and a banana makes a really good breakfast for someone in need.\"\n\nShe said the checkout supervisors at Sainsbury's asked her what she was doing when she was buying the bananas and porridge and she told them.\n\n\"They were happy to hear about what I was doing, even downloading the app to use themselves and they let me get on with it, even giving me keyboard shortcuts on the till to help me go a bit quicker,\" she explained.\n\nWhilst Karen believes this is a potential loophole in the system, staff at Sainsbury's never advised it was against any rules and if this was the case, she says she should have been told by the team, rather than just having her card blocked.\n\nA Nectar spokesperson said: \"We have apologised to Karen for the delay and reactivated her card.\"\n\nSince receiving the news, Karen has said that she is going to try and cash out the funds as soon as possible, just in case something like this happens again.\n\nSainsbury's is currently in the process of unveiling a whole new Nectar system that will allow users to collect points - and gain rewards - digitally.\n\nThe grocer's new app will remember what you buy - and send you offers based on your most frequent purchases, allowing you to make the most of bonus rewards.", "description": "Karen Matthews, from Norwich, says her Nectar card was blocked without any warning\u00a0- only to later be told there were concerns some accounts had been hacked", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20639075.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS192431824.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
