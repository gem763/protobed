So the Constitution\u2014abuse of power is not a crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s fundamentally boil it down,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Constitution is very clear that there has to be some pretty egregious behavior and they cannot tell the American people what this case is even about.\u201d\n\nThe articles of impeachment against former President Bill Clinton specifically laid out gross abuse of presidential power charges. Richard Nixon was also looking at three articles of impeachment\u2014one of which was for abuse of power\u2014before he resigned as president.", "description": "Matthew Whitaker also blasted the \u201cglobal elitists and careerists\u201d who are upset with Trump for \u201cupsetting the apple cart\u201d of the \u201cworld establishment.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571801760/ingraham-angle_47_cxlypv", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
