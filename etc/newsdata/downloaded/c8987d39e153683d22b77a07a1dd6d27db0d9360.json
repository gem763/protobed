If he doesn't, will some members of his caucus \u2014 many of whom were elected in B.C. \u2014 rebel?\n\nTrudeau doesn't have an easier path on the pipeline issue with either the Greens or the Bloc, as both parties have made it clear they are against its construction.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh celebrates after his election victory in Burnaby South. (Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\nWhither the Greens?\n\nAnd what's next for the other federal leader from British Columbia, the Green Party's Elizabeth May?\n\nIn her election speech, she celebrated the fact that her party had the best-ever result for the Greens in a first-past-the-post national election.\n\nThat's a generous assessment for a party that received more attention than ever, but only added a single seat across the country and was unable to eclipse the popular vote total May got in her first election as leader in 2008.\n\nThat doesn't mean the party lacks relevance, though. In a minority parliament, the Greens' three seats could be critical.\n\nEven one vote can be critical. Independent MP Jody Wilson-Raybould will likely have an amplified voice in the House of Commons, and allied herself with May during the campaign.\n\n\"We're going to make [a minority government] work by dint of hard work, moral persuasion ... and holding their feet to the fire,\" she said.\n\nGreen Party leader Elizabeth May speaks to supporters after her victory in Saanich\u2014Gulf Islands. (Chris Corday/CBC)\n\nUrban-rural split\n\nThe minority Parliament \u2014 and the role the fourth- and fifth-place parties will play \u2014 means B.C. politicians and B.C. issues will stay in the forefront.\n\nOn a riding-by-riding level, very little changed from four years ago: the Greens and NDP held Vancouver Island, the NDP and Conservatives kept the Interior and the Liberals won the most seats in Vancouver, despite gains by the Conservatives in the suburbs.\n\nIt's that final point that bears underlining: Even though Justin Trudeau didn't need 11 MPs in Metro Vancouver to form government, he got them. It's the Liberal Party's second-best result in B.C. in the last 50 years, with their best coming four years ago.\n\nIt's a reminder that there's strong support in Western Canada's largest metropolis for progressive politics, and that the political culture on the West Coast continues to evolve.\n\nEven if, on this election night, it felt like the same old story.", "description": "About two minutes before the first polling stations provided votes from Canada's westernmost province, a Liberal government was declared.
