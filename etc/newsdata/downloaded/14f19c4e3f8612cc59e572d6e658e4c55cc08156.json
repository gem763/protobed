The strong winds, some as high as 70 mph, are expected to abate by Thursday afternoon.\n\nResidents in areas where power was going out lined up at gas stations and streamed into stores in pursuit of generators, flashlights, batteries and nonperishable food. The outage also prompted schools and universities to cancel classes and some businesses to close.\n\n'A victim of their own failure': Why PG&E's massive power shutdown in California was inevitable\n\nThe first phase of the Public Safety Power Shutoff cut out electric service to 513,000 homes and businesses \u2014 or more than 1 million people \u2014 starting early Wednesday morning and affected mostly Northern California. Crews had restored power for 50,000 subscribers in the Sierra Foothills by Wednesday evening, PG&E Vice President Sumeet Singh said in a news conference.\n\nThe second phase was initially scheduled to start at noon and stretch to parts of cities as large as San Jose and Santa Cruz, impacting more than half a million people, but it was delayed. It's expected to be implemented between 8 and 10 p.m. Pacific Time.\n\nPG&E said an additional 4,600 subscribers in the southernmost areas it covers could go also dark Thursday, down from an original estimate of 46,000. Every customer account represents between two and three people.\n\nNearly all nine counties in the San Francisco Bay Area were subject to the shutdowns, the only exception being the city and county of San Francisco.\n\nPG&E planned to release a new website allowing customers to search for outages by zip code and find help centers. Over the next day, customers will be able to find updates on power restoration there, too, said PG&E Senior Vice President Laurie Giammona.\n\nOnce dangerous weather conditions in Northern California subside around noon Friday, Singh said crews can begin visually inspecting power lines for damage during daylight hours. Power can be restored quickly if there is no damage, he said, but repairing lines may take longer.\n\nPG&E is trying to prevent downed power lines or vegetation contact with its equipment from sparking fires. Some of California\u2019s most destructive blazes in recent years were started by the utility's power lines.\n\nParts of Southern California could also lose electricity. Southern California Edison said it was considering implementing the shutoff plan to cut power to 173,000 customers. San Diego Gas Electric said 30,000 of its customers were put on similar alert.\n\nAt approximately noon, 65 customers in Kern County on the Tehachapi circuit saw their power cut due to high winds, SCE said. A weather station at the Tehachapi Municipal Airport indicated maximum gusts at 32 mph for the next 24 hours.\n\n\"We understand the effects this event will have on our customers and appreciate the public's patience as we do what is necessary to keep our communities safe and reduce the risk of wildfire,\" PG&E senior VP Michael Lewis said in a web posting.\n\nSome officials expressed frustration with the PG&E plan. Gov. Gavin Newsom said the blackout was necessary but urged the utility to improve infrastructure, a sentiment also expressed by Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf.\n\nRep. Doug LaMalfa, a Republican whose district includes Redding, blamed the need for an outage on decades of frivolous lawsuits, bureaucracies, excessive forest protection policy and onerous regulations utilities face.\n\n\"Expecting the power to stay on when the wind blows isn\u2019t that giant a leap for mankind,\" LaMalfa said. \"Yet here we are 50 years after the first moon landing having great inconvenience and personal or economic losses for many of our residents.\"\n\nThe precautionary outages had some of those residents grumbling, many about food they fear will go bad.", "description": "Californians were in the dark during a multiday power outage aimed at curbing wildfire risks amid high winds.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Michele Chandler", "Jorge L.
