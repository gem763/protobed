He paid a financial adviser to pick a deal for him when he retired with a pension pot of \u00a3146,000 in 2006, and he chose an annuity with Prudential, paying him around \u00a38,000 every year. Years later, Rick, 72, learned he could have had around 5 per cent more because he has a cardiac artery disease that resulted in a heart attack in 2002. Prudential admits his entitlement, but says his adviser never mentioned the medical condition and it refuses to pay Rick the rate he deserves. Rick says: 'I can understand from a business viewpoint, but surely they have a heart? It's about \u00a340 a month \u2014 absolutely nothing. ' The grandfather-of-two, from Perth, took his case to the Financial Ombudsman and Financial Services Compensation Scheme, but was denied redress. He was told there was no evidence his adviser knew about his heart problem. A Prudential spokesman says: 'We have every sympathy for his position. However, it is not possible to retrospectively change the calculated annuity amount due to health issues present at the start of any agreement that we were not made aware of, or health issues that subsequently emerge.'\n\nThis week, the Prudential was fined \u00a324 million for its part in the scandal. Regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) revealed on Monday how the firm's staff were rewarded with huge bonuses, holidays and spa breaks for making the most sales.\n\nNow experts say any providers who sold rip-off annuities may have profited twice from customers who died sooner \u2014 many of whom may have deserved much better rates.\n\nIn 2017, for the first time since records began in 1982, life expectancy did not improve. And company reports show that firms, including Prudential, made a total of \u00a31.8 billion last year as a result.\n\nPrudential, which is facing a total \u00a3250 million compensation bill for mis-selling annuities, made \u00a3411 million last year from the stall in life expectancy.\n\nIn 2017, for the first time since records began in 1982, life expectancy did not improve. And company reports show that firms made a total of \u00a31.8 billion last year as a result\n\nStandard Life was also fined \u00a331 million by the FCA this summer for failing customers. It sold its annuity business last year to Phoenix Life \u2014 which made an extra \u00a3168 million.\n\nAviva made an extra \u00a3780 million. It was not probed further by the FCA, but it did admit to selling the wrong annuity to at least 250 sick pensioners.\n\nLegal & General was also thought to be part of the regulator's review, but faced no further action. The insurer made \u00a3433 million last year \u2014 also as a result of 'changes in longevity improvement assumptions'.\n\nFormer pensions minister Ros Altmann says: 'Lots of people who got these poor-value annuities are not even with us any more.\n\n'Many pension providers will have based their forecasts on life expectancy continuing to go up, and now are profiting at the expense of customers.'\n\nAnnuity Crisis: Q&A What's gone wrong? Annuity rates last month hit a 25-year low, meaning that a 65-year-old with a \u00a350,000 pot will now get \u00a32,237 a year when they buy one. The same \u00a350,000 pot would have bought a guaranteed annual income of \u00a33,627 for life in 2007, before interest rates were slashed during the financial crisis. Are they still worth considering? Annuities remain one of the few ways to achieve a guaranteed lifetime income at retirement. This is incredibly useful for many savers \u2014 particularly given that a typical retirement is now 30 per cent longer than people expect, at 22 years, according to Scottish Widows. But once you have used your pension pot to buy an annuity, you are locked into that deal until you die \u2014 even if you go on to develop a serious health condition that shortens your life expectancy. How do you get a good deal? The golden rule is that pension savers should always get quotes from several different providers, as you are unlikely to get the best rate from the firm you saved with. The Government-funded Money Advice Service (moneyadviceservice.org.uk) allows you to compare different rates online. What are the alternatives? Since pension freedoms were introduced in 2015, you can dip in and out as often as you like after you reach 55. You need to convert your pension into an income drawdown account so your pot can be invested in the stock market while you draw money out. Any income from such an investment is not guaranteed, though.

Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, says: 'For many years, life expectancy has been improving faster than expected and insurers and pension schemes have had to find extra money to meet their obligations.\n\n'Sadly, those improvements have slowed and, as a result, many insurers have surplus funds which they did not expect.'\n\nWhile life expectancy did not improve for men and women in 2017, it rose again in 2018, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics last week.\n\nThis means that annuity income rates, which hit rock- bottom last month, could plummet even further.\n\nA spokesman for the Association of British Insurers says: 'An annuity provides a guaranteed income for life \u2014 regardless of any future changes in life expectancy, investment returns, interest rates or the health and lifestyle of the customer.\n\n'If life expectancy rises, or interest rates fall, insurers will take the resulting financial hit, and customers will still receive the pension they expect.'\n\nb.wilkinson@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Pension giants made more than \u00a31.8 billion last year because their customers died earlier than had been expected.
