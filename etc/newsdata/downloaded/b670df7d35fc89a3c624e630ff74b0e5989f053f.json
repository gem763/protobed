I thought, \u201cAye, aye\u201d. But he trains every day with a big beaming smile. He is so refreshing. He wants to play and is a great kid.\n\n\u2018The first thing he said coming off at the end is, \u201cThank you\u201d. That\u2019s ridiculous after what he\u2019s just done.\u2019\n\nBruce had warned the older brother to forget about interest from Manchester United before the game after talk of a summer approach.\n\nBruce also hailed the performance of Matty's brother Sean alongside him in midfield\n\nBut the boss said: \u2019That\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen Sean play for a long, long time. They have a lot of bumps in the road ahead of them before we can say they are fully established, but the two of them have made a big statement today.\u2019\n\nMatty, making only his second senior appearance, said: \u2018Last night you go to bed dreaming of it but you never think it will happen.\n\n\u2018I found out I was in the team yesterday (Saturday) after training, the butterflies started going, I was buzzing.\u2019\n\nSean added: \u2018Matty has been the best player in training and he was a breath of fresh air. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of him. Look how lively he was, he made my job a lot easier.\n\nSean said his brother had been the best player in training and was a breath of fresh air\n\n\u2018He was really quiet last night, he\u2019s usually bouncing around the house shouting. I\u2019ve never heard him so quiet!\u2019\n\nBruce, meanwhile, cut a relieved man after a week in which scrutiny has intensified following the embarrassment of Leicester.\n\n\u2018The big thing when you get beat badly is how you respond,\u2019 he said. \u2018A lot of harsh words were spoken this week and rightly so. But you then need your team to perform, and they did.\u2019", "description": "Steve Bruce was there when each of Manchester United's fabled Class of '92 made their Premier League debuts, but never has he witnessed a better one than that of Matty Longstaff.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/20/19369278-0-image-a-8_1570390198310.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
