Why is it so hard to believe that many people, including me, like him best of all the 2020 Democrats?\n\nI keep reading that no one \u2014 not even Jill Biden \u2014 actually prefers Joe Biden to the other Democratic presidential candidates. Supposedly, he is a front-runner who is solely supported, with tiny sighs and great regret, by those too fearful to follow their hearts. My friend Walter Shapiro has written that Biden is the \u201csafety school\u201d of Democrats \u2014 regarded fondly, but the first choice of nobody.\n\nEarly admission: He\u2019s my Harvard, OK? And I do not favor the former vice president because I think he has the best chance of winning, which may or may not be true.\n\nInstead, if the contest were tomorrow, I\u2019d vote Biden because I think he\u2019d do the best job if we did manage to grab the wheel away from a president who reminds me more every day of \u201cVinny the Chin\u201d Gigante, a mob boss who used to go around New York City in his bathrobe and house shoes, babbling to himself. (Vinny might have been faking madness to stay out of prison, but the guy currently faking sanity to stay in the Oval Office does a pretty good Vinny imitation all the same.)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden appears in Clear Lake, Iowa, on Aug. 9, 2019. (Photo: John Locher/AP)\n\nGenuine Biden fans do exist\n\nSo how is it that everywhere I go, I meet Biden supporters who don\u2019t know they\u2019re settling? And how is it that only we nonexistent Joe enthusiasts seem to be able to see each other?\n\nAt a wedding in New York, changing planes in Washington, over coffee in Boston and on my porch in Kansas City, what I hear from pro-Joe Democrats is hardly resignation. Nor is it some complicated, defeatist calculus about how appealing non-Trump-loving Republicans might find him.\n\nDon't underestimate Biden: He knows what America needs and how to get it done.\n\nA childhood friend in Illinois talks about how blessedly comfortable Biden makes her feel \u2014 and if you think \"comfortable\" means meh, you must have slept through the past three fun-filled years.\n\nHis authenticity and experience are exactly what the country needs now, says a former colleague in Florida.\n\nAnd best of all, he would have no learning curve, so he could get right to work undoing the damage caused by what's-his-name, says a therapist in North Carolina.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good, honorable, smart, decent, civil man who has dedicated his entire life to public service,\u201d says Morna Murray, executive director of the Rhode Island Disability Law Center and former senior counsel to Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. \u201cHe was a great senator and vice president, and I\u2019m pretty sure it does not get much better than that!\u201d\n\nWrong for 2020: Joe Biden isn't the boringly reassuring candidate Democrats were hoping for\n\nIt\u2019s early in the campaign, and I\u2019m not even trying to win converts; love who you love, and I will, too. But pundits, please stop insisting that nobody is excited about Biden's candidacy, or that he\u2019s the head-over-heart guy who appeals only to those making a bloodless, Vulcan and strictly strategic choice.\n\nAn empathizer with a giant heart\n\nReally, have you met Joe Biden, people? I ask because if you\u2019ve glimpsed him at any point over the past 40 years, you may have noticed that his biggest selling point is his giant heart, and the way that after multiple tragedies, he walks through the world as the compassionate consoler and messy, highly emotional and ever-ready empathizer we do need most right now. It's strange for those of us who appreciate these qualities in him most of all to then be told that we shouldn't be so passionless and practical in choosing a candidate.\n\nJoe Biden campaigns in Prole, Iowa, on Aug. 20, 2019. (Photo: Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nIt\u2019s so painful to watch Biden being Al Gored, with every utterance shorn of context in service to the narrative. Then, it was that Gore exaggerated. And he did, but the planet is considerably worse off today because we were saved from that nightmare. Today, of course, it\u2019s that Biden is gaffe-prone. And he is, but by getting stuck on Biden gaffes as we did on Gore exaggerations, the planet will be worse off.\n\nNow, maybe this is not completely unlike that day in fourth grade when our teacher Miss Wiswall said, \u201cNo one in here still believes in Santa Claus, do they?\u201d and I put my hand up and said, \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nNot because I didn\u2019t know the other kids would laugh, and not even because I believed in Santa Claus, but because I wished I did, and wanted to stand up for innocence, or maybe just contrarianism, and against being told what to think. What if some other 9-year-old was sitting there crushed at the news? But back to Joe Biden \u2026 Him I do believe in.\n\nMelinda Henneberger is an editorial columnist for The Kansas City Star and a member of the USA TODAY Board of Contributors.
