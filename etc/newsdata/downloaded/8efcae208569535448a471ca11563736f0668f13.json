But more than a year after I did it, I\u2019ve gone from nearly 300 pounds to 160 pounds and I\u2019ve never never felt better. Sure, the procedure isn\u2019t right for everyone ( some patients do regain a portion of the weight they lose after surgery ), but my only regret is that I didn\u2019t have the surgery sooner.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Courtesy of Elizabeth Johnson More\n\nGrowing up in a small town in Kentucky, I don\u2019t remember anyone ever putting me down for being bigger which, unfortunately, is not the experience I think most overweight kids have. One memory that does stick out: You know how, in school, they'd send around a sign-up sheet for t-shirts for whatever team or group activity you're doing? Everyone can see the size you request. My classmates would write down smalls and mediums and I\u2019m putting down an XL at 8 years old. A lot of times, I\u2019d write down a size I knew wouldn't fit to avoid feeling embarrassed.\n\nToday, people still tend to think that overweight people are unhealthy. That if we just ate healthier and exercised we\u2019d lose all the weight. But that\u2019s not true. I have been overweight since those t-shirt sign-up days\u2014even while playing sports like softball and volleyball. I\u2019ve done Weight Watchers and Curves, but I always gained the weight right back. I even did CrossFit for two years in my early twenties. That worked at first\u2014only to gain it all back plus 25 pounds. The yo-yo-ing is a fairly common experience for anyone who\u2019s tried to lose weight, but obesity is different. A nurse put it to me like this: You don't just tell someone who's diabetic to eat better. You tell them to eat better, and you also take corrective medical measures. It was because of her that I realized I may not be able to lose weight on my own.\n\n\n\n\n\nI decided to go for it when, at 25, I stepped on a scale and 297 flashed across the screen. I thought, I'm almost at 300 pounds. It scared me. My parents were in their mid-50s and having a lot of issues because of their weight; my mom needed a knee replacement and my dad had diabetes. I wanted to get ahead of any chronic illnesses before I had them. And weight loss surgery felt like a sound way to get started.\n\nFirst, a Bikini Dance Competition\n\nIt just so happened that my mom, a registered nurse, was visiting me when I had this epiphany. I told her what I was thinking, assuming she would say it wouldn\u2019t work. Instead she said, \u201cI know a lot of people have had a lot of success with that, I think it would be great.\u201d We started researching right away.\n\nI joined a couple Facebook groups and started following all the weight loss surgery hashtags on Instagram. I heard from people who had lap-band surgery in the early 2000s, and they had gained all the weight back. Others had a gastric bypass, which is pretty invasive and tends to have more complications. I quickly settled on gastric sleeve surgery, a procedure that removes a portion of your stomach and leaves you with minimal scarring.\n\nDifferent insurance companies require different things before they will approve you for weight loss surgery. Baseline, you have to have a BMI of at least 40. I also had to have a psychological evaluation, do a sleep apnea test, and participate in a six-month supervised diet that required monthly check-ups with my doctor. It\u2019s basically a last-ditch effort to see if you can lose the weight on your own, which is insulting. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s first approach to weight loss is \u201cI\u2019m going to have 85 percent of my stomach cut out.\u201d At the same time, it gave me a window to mentally and physically prepare for what was to come.", "description": "My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Johnson", "As Told To Ashley Edwards Walker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WkWh0Gz4ro08gIqlUg42zg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_prevention_66/f0f2550b6b29421a722f11a3e3dcdd2d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
