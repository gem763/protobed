The crisis may look slightly different, but essentially couples reach an impasse where they realize the path they\u2019re on isn\u2019t working for them anymore, yet they can't see a way forward.\n\nWhat can couples do? It's really important to step back, and then look underneath. So rather than focusing on the issue at hand, making an immediate decision, or the practicalities, what\u2019s critical for a couple is to look under the surface at what is really going on in their relationship that's driving the decisions they\u2019re making.\n\nWhen we discuss deeper psychological dynamics, we can really unlock and understand things at the practical level.\n\nWhat's really going on can be about a power struggle. It could be about the roles we play in each other's lives. It could be about the expectations others have on us that we feel we need to live up to. And it could be about our hopes and dreams that maybe are not being realized. When we discuss deeper psychological dynamics, we can really unlock and understand things at the practical level. But how can we do that?\n\nOne exercise to practice is called \u201ccouple contracting.\u201d This involves talking honestly about what you both want from your relationship and your life together, and what are the things each of you is worried about. In couple contracting, there are three specific areas to talk through. You don\u2019t have to agree; you just share and discuss.\n\nThe first is expectations. Namely, what do I want out of our relationship? What will make this worthwhile for me? What are the things I want from our career, and how might you support me in that?\n\nThat's the easy part. The second involves setting boundaries. Oftentimes we think of boundaries negatively. Boundaries restrict my choices, therefore they can't be good. In fact, research shows that strong boundaries enhance feelings of safety and security. While boundaries reduce our choices, they simplify our lives and make us feel a lot more stable.\n\nRelationship boundaries could be geographic: we're only going to consider living in these areas and not beyond. They may be boundaries around time: for example, how much travel is permitted? Such boundaries around choices allow us to make concrete decisions.\n\nThe third and perhaps most difficult area to talk through are our fears. What do we worry about in our relationship and in our careers? It's crucial to talk through this because unless I know my partner's fears, I can\u2019t do anything to mitigate them \u2014 and I will do things unwittingly that activate their fears.\n\nSo if I know that my partner is worried, for example, about the role of my family in our relationship, I will be more mindful about that and try to construct clear boundaries. Similarly, if I know that my partner worries about how our careers might bump into each other, we're more likely to have explicit conversations to resolve this.\n\nAt any stage of life, at any transition, when couples have real conversations about the stuff lurking underneath, they\u2019re better able to work through the struggles they face on the surface.\n\nJennifer Petriglieri is an associate professor at INSEAD and the author of Couples That Work: How Dual-Career Couples Can Thrive in Love and Work .
