This story is false. Compare the May 2018 version of the form (left) with the version currently on the DNI's website. Fake story. Also, the requirements are set by 50 USC 3033 (k)(5) and can only be changed by legislation.

A new version of the complaint form allowing hearsay was secretly revised last month. https://t.co/ZvCpCMBx8h \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) September 27, 2019\n\nAnd they won\u2019t comment on this major change which is at the heart of what\u2019s looking like the impeachment of President Trump:\n\nWhen asked via phone when the secret revisions were made and why the requirement for first-hand whistleblower knowledge was eliminated, an intelligence community spokeswoman said they would not comment on any questions about the secret evidence revisions. https://t.co/ZvCpCMBx8h \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) September 27, 2019\n\nWow. Just, wow:\n\nGreat reporting by Sean Davis here. https://t.co/98rO78FRop \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 27, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s the opener:\n\nBetween May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings. This raises questions about the intelligence community\u2019s behavior regarding the August submission of a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump. The new complaint document no longer requires potential whistleblowers who wish to have their concerns expedited to Congress to have direct, first-hand knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing that they are reporting. The brand new version of the whistleblower complaint form, which was not made public until after the transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and the complaint addressed to Congress were made public, eliminates the first-hand knowledge requirement and allows employees to file whistleblower complaints even if they have zero direct knowledge of underlying evidence and only \u201cheard about [wrongdoing] from others.\u201d\n\nThe rest here.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll just throw this old statement from Sen. Chuck Schumer out there:\n\nChuck Schumer on Trump in 2017: \u201cLet me tell you: You take on the intelligence community \u2014 they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you\u201d pic.twitter.com/gVUbUKTt0x \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 27, 2019\n\n***\n\nEditor\u2019s note.
