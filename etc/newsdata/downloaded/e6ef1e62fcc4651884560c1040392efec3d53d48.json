All you have to do is record what you have done and how you feel, and the app will do the rest.\n\n\u2018Within 30 days you\u2019ll have a definitive answer for what is causing your high blood pressure and can take steps to address it,\u2019 he adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Our goal is to help people take their health into their own hands \u2013 we want to give people the tools they need to beat high blood pressure naturally.\u2019\n\n\u2018I was confident that if I got enough data I\u2019d have a good chance of discovering what was behind it\u2019 (Picture: BP Owl)\n\nHigh blood pressure is the world\u2019s biggest killer, causing an estimated 10.4m deaths per year, yet with so many potential lifestyle causes it can be difficult for health professionals to identify the cause for individual patients.\n\nThe condition \u2013 which affects one in four people in the UK \u2013 is responsible for at least half of all heart attacks and strokes, and is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease, heart failure and dementia.\n\nFor every 10 people who have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, it is estimated that a further seven are unaware that they have it.\n\nBP Owl has also been working with cardiovascular specialist, Dr Lutz Kraushaar, from Bielefeld University in Germany.\n\n\u2018BP Owl is a big step towards personalized preventive medicine, something which doctors don\u2019t currently have the capacity to provide,\u2019 said Dr Kraushaar.\n\n\u2018Currently, the medical profession relies on clinical trials as the foundation of its advice to patients.\n\n\u2018However, trials typically test a single intervention and generalise their conclusions based on averages, even though, in reality, it\u2019s likely that the intervention worked really well for some people, less well for others and not at all \u2013 or even negatively \u2013 for a small number.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018BP Owl turns this method on its head in favour of the user, so that rather than being limited by a one-size-fits-all intervention, the individual can trial-and-error multiple options until they find what\u2019s most effective for them.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mindfulness can help you get over your biggest fears\n\nMORE: Exercising before eating breakfast \u2018burns more fat\u2019\n\nMORE: Family adopt a \u2018micro pig\u2019, end up with 28-stone porker taking over their house\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A Manchester man created an app to track his high blood pressure and managed to figure out the underlying cause using simple data.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bp-owl-comp_1571391834.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
