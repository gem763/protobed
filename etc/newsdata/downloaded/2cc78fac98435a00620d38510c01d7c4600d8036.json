For the first time in the nation\u2019s history, punters were given the chance to test substances they hoped were drugs in order to ascertain whether they might fuck them up in a good way, fuck them up in a bad way, or not fuck them up at all.\n\nAmong the innocuous antihistamines and dietary supplements found in people\u2019s pingers, there was at least one psychoactive substance showing up in two different pills that raised a red flag for experts in the field: a highly toxic, \"absolutely lethal\" compound known as N-Ethylpentylone. Earlier this year, at Groovin the Moo\u2019s second pill-testing trial, the same substance was detected in at least seven \u201cecstasy\u201d tablets.\n\nThere\u2019s a troubling reason why this so-called \u201cbath salt\u201d might be starting to rear its ugly head of late, and we\u2019ll get to that. But N-Ethylpentylone isn\u2019t the only noxious psychoactive to have been sold to unsuspecting users in Australia under the guise of MDMA in recent times. In 2007, a 20-year-old Sydney dance teacher named Annabel Catt died after dropping two caps which, unbeknownst to her, contained the adulterant para-Methoxyamphetamine, or PMA. More recently, in 2017, three people at Melbourne\u2019s Revolver nightclub were killed by what was initially described as \"a bad batch of MDMA\", but later revealed to be \"a cocktail of illicit substances\u201d\u2014including a lethal strain of the powerful hallucinogen N-benzyl Methoxy, or NBOMe.\n\n\u201cJust say no\u201d crusaders love to give chemical compounds provocative misnomers like \u201crat poison\u201d, \u201crocket fuel,\u201d and \u201cdrain cleaner.\u201d While none of these descriptions quite fit the bill, the reality is almost as menacing\u2014and it's important to take stock of what we're actually looking at in contaminated pills.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to stress that even pure MDMA can kill you. Too much ecstasy can lead to a sharp increase in core body temperature or a condition known as \u201cserotonin syndrome\u201d, where the body loses its ability to regulate heat. When a dose like that is ingested in already hot settings, it can be deadly. Many of these problems are further exacerbated, though, when unknown chemicals are added to the mix.\n\nThese are some of the most common and dangerous adulterants to have been passed off as \u201cMDMA\u201d in Australia in recent years. While N-Ethylpentylone was the only one to have been detected at this year\u2019s pill-testing trial, the cyclical way in which each of these substances has entered the recreational scene points to a larger, more troubling pattern of drug manufacture and distribution within the country\u2014and highlights why we ought to be cynical toward current hardline drug enforcement strategies.\n\nPara-Methoxyamphetamine\n\n(otherwise known as PMA or \u201cDr Death\u201d)\n\n\u2014slow release\n\nPharmacologically speaking, para-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA) is closely related to both MDMA and mescaline\u2014meaning it has a similar effect to ecstasy, but with stronger hallucinogenic properties. It\u2019s also more toxic, and has a slower come-on period, than pure MDMA. And that\u2019s a potentially fatal combination for anyone who thinks that pure MDMA is what they\u2019re taking.\n\n\u201cIt takes longer for you to feel the effect,\u201d Dr Monica Barrett, Senior Research Fellow at RMIT University\u2019s Social and Global Studies Centre, told VICE over the phone. \u201cIf someone takes a substance that they think is ecstasy but it actually has PMA in it they might think wow this isn\u2019t very strong, I can\u2019t really feel it, and take a second one. And then of course it comes on way too strong.\u201d\n\nPMA\u2014or \u201cDr Death\u201d as it\u2019s been dubbed by the media\u2014has been implicated in a number of deaths in Australia over the years, most likely as a result of increased core body temperature or serotonin syndrome. In a recreational context, where people are ingesting chemicals with a higher toxicity and a more delayed release than they\u2019re used to, it\u2019s easy to see how things can unravel.\n\nIt\u2019s this close-but-not-quite resemblance which Dr Death bears to ecstasy that makes it such a hazardous substance. According to Dr Barrett, it might also be the reason why the chemical started popping up in Australia\u2019s pills in the first place: as an affordable stand-in for MDMA.\n\n\u201cPMA is not a new drug\u2014it\u2019s been around since 1973\u2014but it\u2019s structurally related to the MDMA classes. So one idea is that it\u2019s potentially easier to make, or cheaper to make, and at some point it could have been profitable to make it and sell it as MDMA,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cOn that note, though, we haven\u2019t really seen much evidence of it around in the last few years.\u201d\n\nN-benzyl Methoxy\n\n(otherwise known as NBOMe)\n\n\u2014incredibly potent\n\nNBOMe in tab form. Image via Wikimedia\n\nWhile Dr Death had all but slipped back into obscurity in Australia by the end of the noughties, it wasn\u2019t long before another menacing contaminant took its place.\n\nN-benzyl Methoxy is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of hallucinogenic substances. These \u201cNBOMes\u201d are analogs of an emerging class of drugs called psychedelic phenethylamines\u2014think 2CB, otherwise known as \u201ctripstacy\u201d\u2014and mimic the effects of both LSD and MDMA. Similar to PMA, however, NBOMes typically have a higher potency and toxicity than the drugs they\u2019re trying to replicate.\n\nNBOMes are toxic enough to cause organ failure, can lead to blood clots, and have been known to trigger powerful psychedelic effects in extremely small doses. While the average amount of MDMA found in a cap or ecstasy pill is usually somewhere in the range of 100 milligrams, NBOMes are measured in microdoses, with an effective dose ranging between 200 micrograms (one fifth of a milligram) and 1000 micrograms (one milligram). There\u2019s also a fine line between what counts as an effective dose of NBOMe and and what might constitute an overdose, making it easy to take too much.\n\nDr Barrett related a string of incidents a few years ago where NBOMe tabs\u2014masquerading as LSD\u2014were found to contain 1200 micrograms a pop. \u201cThat was a concern: that six effective doses were being bundled up into a single tab and sold as LSD,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were some NBOMe deaths around that time.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the substance was also linked to a number of deaths in Victoria after multiple people took what they thought was ecstasy. A safety memo circulated internally by Victoria Police's Drug Taskforce at the time, and subsequently obtained by VICE, revealed that although the capsules appeared to have been sold as MDMA, the drugs actually contained a \u201ccocktail of illicit substances\u201d including 25C-NBOMe. Three people died and 20 were hospitalised by that \u201cbad batch\u201d.\n\nSymptoms of an NBOMe overdose include high blood pressure, heart palpitations, seizures, psychosis, and elevated body temperature\u2014otherwise known as hyperthermia. Even in more benign cases, though, the trip is anecdotally described as intense and distressing: inducing feelings of confusion, nausea, paranoia, and aggression.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be any reports of NBOMes showing up in Australia in the past 12 months.\n\nN-Ethylpentylone\n\n(otherwise known as ephylone, bk-EBDP, or NEP)\n\n\u2014highly toxic\n\nN-Ethylpentylone, or \u201cNEP\u201d, appears to be the latest harmful additive to have infiltrated Australia\u2019s party drug scene: showing up in seven dangerous substances at this year\u2019s Groovin the Moo pill-testing trial.\n\nUnlike PMA and NBOMe, which are both closely related to MDMA, NEP is defined as a synthetic cathinone\u2014that is, a synthetic stimulant that mimics the naturally occurring stimulant found in the khat plant. Other synthetic cathinones, or \u201cbath salts\u201d as they\u2019re more colloquially known, include the \u201czombie drug\u201d flakka (alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone) and monkey dust (Methylenedioxypyrovalerone).\n\nWhile not as closely related as PMA or NBOMe, however, NEP does still resemble MDMA by way of its appearance and stimulating effects\u2014and is often passed off as or cut with ecstasy for this very reason. Problem is, it\u2019s also about three times stronger than MDMA, and in high doses can lead to rapid muscle breakdown, multiple organ failure, and death.\n\nKate Pern, a nurse at Thorne Harbour Health and a member of peer-led harm reduction initiative PARTi project (otherwise known as Sesh Ed) told VICE that NEP\u2019s close resemblance to MDMA, combined with its three-fold potency, could be a potentially deadly mix.\n\n\u201cIf someone believed they had MDMA but it was actually N-Ethylpentylone, they might take a dose that they have had previously without any serious ill effects and end up with a fatal overdose,\u201d she explained over email. Kate further noted that anecdotal reports from people who have accidentally taken NEP indicate it takes longer than MDMA to kick in; that initially it may feel similar to MDMA but more \u201cspeedy\u201d; and that unlike MDMA, the enjoyable effects usually fade quite quickly\u2014after an hour to two\u2014which can then leave the user feeling anxious, agitated, and paranoid.\n\n\u201cThis can lead to people taking more in a futile attempt to stop the unpleasant feelings and regain the enjoyable ones,\u201d she suggested. \u201cRe-dosing also seems to disproportionately prolong the effects, making sleep difficult or impossible for up to 48 hours. There are even reports of people having trouble sleeping for weeks after taking it\u2014and sleep deprivation can increase the risk of paranoia and psychosis.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just what we know anecdotally. N-Ethylpentylone is such a recent emergence in the novel psychoactive substance scene that there hasn\u2019t been any research into the short- or long-term effects.\n\n\u201cWe know that it\u2019s significantly more harmful than commonly used drugs like MDMA or cocaine, so it's not a drug that anyone should intentionally take,\u201d said Kate. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people who choose to take MDMA in Australia know that this comes with a risk that what they have may contain N-Ethylpentylone, or something else that\u2019s harmful.\u201d\n\nThe Problem with Prohibition\n\nThere are no reported cases of someone having died as a direct result of ingesting NEP in Australia. That can probably be at least partly attributed to the most recent pill-testing trial, which saw the seven festival-goers who presented NEP-laced ecstasy pills throwing their drugs in the bin.\n\nBut why the sudden emergence of N-Ethylpentylone in recent years? And moreover, why are we seeing this pattern of harmful adulterants cycling in and out of the drug scene every few years?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that prohibition is to blame. As the war on drugs wages on, and authorities continue to exert pressure and clamp down on the supply of illicit substances in Australia, the precursor chemicals used to make drugs like ecstasy are getting harder and harder to obtain. That doesn\u2019t stop the suppliers though, who are more than happy to plug the holes in the market with various approximations.\n\nDr Matthew Frei, clinical director of Eastern Health's alcohol and other drug treatment centre Turning Point, described it to VICE as follows:\n\n\u201cWhen a shipment of ecstasy arrives through customs, they\u2019ll test it and then arrest someone over that shipment. When a shipment of N-Ethylpentylone arrives through customs, they are often not really sure what its composition is and so they\u2019ll let it pass through border control. This is what leads to drug trafficking where unknown drugs enter the market.\u201d\n\nDr Frei further noted that \u201cmaking MDMA illegal, policing for drugs at music events, and limiting pill testing all appear to worsen the risk of drug use at these events.\n\n\u201cThis is the environment where drug traffickers are looking for options that are less problematic to sell,\u201d he explained over the phone. \u201cDrugs of uncertain legal status are a risk in these settings\u2026 and these issues seem to encourage the use and distribution of novel psychoactive substances.\u201d\n\nThus the revolving door of increasingly novel substances entering the drug pool. Even as one contaminant comes to public attention and is subsequently stamped out by authorities, another is inevitably there to fill its place. On this view, Australia\u2019s war on drugs starts to resemble an endless game of whack-a-mole\u2014with an infinite number of moles.\n\nThe pill-testing trial can rightly be hailed as a success for how it identified the potentially fatal substance N-Ethylpentylone, brought it to the forefront of the public\u2019s attention, and ultimately deterred people from ingesting it. But to take the long view, it\u2019s just one part of a much bigger problem\u2014and as Dr Barrett suggests, there\u2019s no way of knowing what kind of harmful additives and adulterants we might run into in the near future.\n\n\u201cWill we be seeing N-Ethylpentylone in the next festival season?\" she wonders aloud. \"What will we see coming up into the next season? There will still be synthetic compounds that can be passed off as stimulant drugs\u2014but what will they be?\n\n\"That\u2019s something that we don\u2019t really know yet.\u201d\n\nPARTi Project and Sesh Ed are evidence-based harm reduction initiatives encouraging safer partying through drug awareness and education.
