This is years before this is incident with Brooke Nevils and the firing,' Farrow said on Friday morning.\n\nHe added that given what he claims to have uncovered with a 'paper trail of documents', it is 'difficult to believe' that NBC executives did not know about Lauer's alleged behavior.\n\n'It is indisputable that there was a chain of secret settlements at this company that were covered up with victims of harassment and assault.\n\n'Some of them about Lauer, some about others in the company. This was a pattern, it was concealed from journalists there.\n\n'It's bigger than NBC, it's bigger than executives. This is a pattern in media, in law, in politics - institutions that conceal abuse of this type, let people get hurt.'\n\nAn NBC News spokesman refuted his claims to DailyMail.com on Friday morning.\n\n'The first time we learned about Matt Lauer's sexual misconduct in the workplace was the night of November 27, 2017 and he was fired in 24 hours.\n\n'Any suggestion that we knew prior to that evening, paid any \"hush money,\u201d or tried to cover up any aspect of Lauer's appalling behavior is absolutely false.\n\n'NBCU's legal team has done an exhaustive search of available records and conducted dozens of interviews of past and present staff, and uncovered no claims or settlements relating to allegations of inappropriate conduct by Matt Lauer that pre-date his firing.\n\nBrooke Nevils agreed to be named in Ronan Farrow's new book where she tells how Matt Lauer 'anally raped' her in 2014 while they were working for NBC to cover the Sochi Winter Olympics. Lauer is shown, right, at the Games\n\nFarrow, 31, has been busy promoting his new book ahead of its October 15 release\n\nFarrow claims he 'extensively' fact checked his book but sources at NBC have denied much of what is written\n\n'Only following his termination did we reach agreements with two women who had come forward for the very first time and those women have always been free to share their stories about Lauer with anyone they choose,' they said.\n\nThe network has also accused Farrow of lying about what proof he had against Harvey Weinstein when he approached news executives with his story in August 2017.\n\nHe has long claimed that the network's bosses squashed the story because they were friends with Weinstein and were under pressure from the disgraced movie mogul.\n\nIn the book, he goes as far as to say that Weinstein had conspired with American Media Inc., which owns The National Enquirer, and that they together were blackmailing NBC with dirt on Lauer to get bosses to 'kill' his story on Weinstein.\n\nThe network said earlier this week when the allegation emerged: 'NBC News was never contacted by AMI, or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter.\n\n'And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity.'\n\nFarrow was fired from NBC in August 2017 after trying unsuccessfully to get executives to publish his reporting on Harvey Weinstein.\n\nHe says it was a cover up and that the network's top brass were being 'blackmailed' by Weinstein with the help of American Media Inc.\n\nNBC has called this allegation 'preposterous' and say Farrow's work simply did not meet its editorial standards. It eventually ran in The New Yorker several weeks later, but NBC executives have repeatedly said that what he took to The New Yorker was more substantial than what he presented to them.\n\nIn a memo to staff in September, chairman Andrew Lack said: 'We regret the deterioration of NBC\u2019s relationship with Ronan, and genuinely wish we had found a path to move forward together.'\n\nIn another memo this week, he said: 'It disappoints me to say that even with passage of time, Farrow\u2019s account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News. He uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture.'\n\nLack is himself accused of sexual harassment in Farrow's new book.\n\nFarrow, the son of Hollywood icon Mia Farrow and director Woody Allen, would not answer whether or not he ever spoke to Matt Lauer for the book.\n\nLauer released a 1,400 word letter earlier this in which he denied the allegation made by Nevils. He said the pair indeed had anal sex on the night she claims he anally raped her, but said it was consensual and that it started a months-long affair between them.\n\nFarrow also claims that because Andy Lack (pictured with Lauer), NBC's Chairman, wrote in an email to staff that Lauer had been fired over an alleged incident which occurred at the Sochi Games, it narrowed down the list of possibilities as to who his alleged victim might be. She had been promised anonymity, she said, but everyone soon figured out that she was the person who had reported him\n\nShe admits continuing to have consensual sex with him afterwards but said his letter was a 'case study in victim blaming'.\n\nFarrow revealed on Friday morning that when she initially reported the incident to NBC executives in November 2017, Nevils did not call it rape or sexual assault.\n\nHe also said he could not answer whether he had spoken to Lauer directly but that his 'thinking' was represented.\n\n'We're very careful about what she said when she went to them. She unambigiously described a rape or a sexual assault.\n\n'Like many trauma victims, she was not ready to use those words,' he said of Nevils reporting her case to the network.\n\n'The facts of her case suggest there was an encounter she consistently described as non-consensual, regardless what she said after that, she said no to a physical act,' Farrow said.\n\nFarrow, 31, also spoke again about being followed by 'spies' - former Mossad agents hired by Weinstein.\n\n' I was told by sources to buy a gun...I moved out of my home. I say all of this not to say \"woe is me\" but to illustrate the threat to the media.\n\n'Powerful people are able to suppress media, the law.... around the world journalists get killed.\n\n'We've got to protect this institution,' he said.", "description": "Farrow appeared on Good Morning America - Today's competitor - on Friday morning to promote his new book, Catch and Kill, which will be released last week.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/13/19588494-0-image-a-19_1570798430305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
