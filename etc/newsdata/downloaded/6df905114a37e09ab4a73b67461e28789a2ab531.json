North Eastern Woman Denied Entry Into Posh Nightclub In New Delhi", "language": "en", "text": "If the first thing that comes to your mind when you see someone from the North East, is \u201cchinky\u201d or \u201cmomos,\u201d sorry, but you\u2019re part of the lot that is stereotypical and racist. In yet another case of discrimination, a 40-year-old woman hailing from Darjeeling was barred from entering an upscale club in the heart of New Delhi on Saturday night. Here\u2019s what happened.\n\nWoman denied entry into nightclub\n\nAs per reports, Bidya, a professional working as an administrative manager at EduVelocity in New Delhi, was out partying with six of her co-workers, celebrating a junior colleague\u2019s birthday on Saturday night. The group of seven had made prior reservations for the same, at Privee The Ecstasy, an upscale club situated in the same building as the 5-star Shangri-la\u2019s-Eros Hotel at Connaught Place. The gang arrived at the venue by 12.15 am, but were denied access by the club manager, who stated that the passes were over.\n\nAfter talking it out and trying to resolve the issue, a female official at the club finally gave in. However, what came as a shock to Bidya, is that she only allowed her six co-workers to enter, stopping her behind a barricade. She told the gang that Bidya will join them shortly.\n\nOn being told that, the friend who had helped to book the passes volunteered to stay back with Bidya, assuring the rest that they\u2019d follow soon. After a while, as they tried to enter again, the woman allowed the friend who volunteered to stay back in, but again, specifically stopped Bidya.\n\nIn conversation with a leading daily in the North East, Bidya said that she felt extremely \u201cembarrassed by the behaviour and attitude of the pub management,\u201d and decided to leave after a prolonged argument with the pub\u2019s PR manager. She said: \u201cI have been working in Delhi for the past 18 years. This incident has shocked me and I have never felt so embarrassed like this before.\u201d\n\nBidya cites this as racial discrimination\n\nAlthough the club did not say it in so many words, Bidya feels she was singled out and not allowed access, only because of her North Eastern appearance. \u201cIf there were any other reasons for the denial like dress code or age, they would have conveyed it to me at the first attempt, but I felt like my appearance as a person from the Northeast must have triggered them to restrain me from getting inside the pub,\u201d she said.\n\nFurther, she said that the racial discrimination against Northeast Indians by the \u201cmainlanders\u201d is still very prevalent, even though the government is working hard to eradicate this. \u201cThis racial stereotyping should be uprooted as it is disgraceful and most of the times embarrasses us even though we are from the same nation,\u201d she strongly concluded.", "description": "A middle-aged woman from the North East, was denied entry into Privee The Ecstasy, an upscale club situated in the same building as the 5-star Shangri-la\u2019s-Eros Hotel at Connaught Place.
