Not because they doubt the chance that these two thoroughly attractive people could find happiness in each other\u2019s toned arms, but because the long-term collaborators \u2013 they released their first joint single I Know What You Did Last Summer back in 2015 \u2013 decided to do couple-y things in public at roughly the same time they released another collab, the UK and US No 1 single Se\u00f1orita.\n\nIt all whiffs a touch of last year\u2019s pop hook-up between Noah \u201csister of Miley\u201d Cyrus and SoundCloud rapper Lil Xan, which Xan now insists was set up by their record label Columbia to promote their uninspiring joint single Live Or Die (although Cyrus has since denied this). If all of Shawn and Camila\u2019s gyrating while performing at last week\u2019s MTV VMAs is just to make people fall even harder for them, then props to them. Rumoured PR-d relationships have forever been a mainstay of Top 40 supremacy.\n\nThese relationships are never usually spun out for longer than a couple of months, tops. For example, Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston\u2019s romance was immediately raised as suspicious, with the leggy blonds\u2019 brief 2016 coupling called out as a \u201cfauxmance\u201d, \u201chelped\u201d by Hiddleston\u2019s I <3 TS shirt and some extremely staged pics of them snogging on a big rock. Rumours also persist that Tay\u2019s hook-up with a young Harry Styles was set up as planned fodder for her hugely successful break-up album 1989. Who can say?\n\nThe 17-year age gap wasn\u2019t the most suspicious thing about Drake and Jennifer Lopez\u2019s short-lived pairing; it was the overly snuggly Instagram posts and all the chat about the song they were working on together. The song, granted, never materialised, but I am quite happy to live in a world in which such a thing doesn\u2019t and never will exist.\n\nThe biggest of all the reputed PR-stunt relationships in music, though, surely must be Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s. The coming together of the Elvis clan and Jackson family back in 1994 was huge news. Handy that, considering Jacko\u2019s sales had started to slide and Presley was attempting to start her own music career. Jackson\u2019s former maid has also recently questioned the authenticity of the pair\u2019s marriage, saying it was arranged as a distraction from unsavoury allegations made by minors. Grim. And another reason to not get too fussed over the comparatively harmless union of Shawn and Camila who may (or may not!?) only be doing it for the streams.", "description": "From Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes to J Lo and Drake, pop is awash with accusations of fake relationships \u2013 but who\u2019s for real?", "authors": ["Leonie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d4f03e086c3a34e2bb54e85dff877e07de8619/0_12_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=893ef4dcb1c912d3c37416c7de9c510c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
