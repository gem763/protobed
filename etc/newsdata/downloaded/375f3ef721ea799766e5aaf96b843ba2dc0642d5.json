Gretchen Whitmer ordered the state health department Wednesday to issue emergency rules to ban sales and prohibit misleading marketing of vaping products, including using words like \u201csafe,\u201d \u201cclean\u201d and \u201chealthy\u201d in advertisements. She also ordered a ban on billboard ads for vaping products.\n\n\u201cCompanies selling vaping products are using candy flavors to hook children on nicotine and misleading claims to promote the belief that these products are safe. That ends today,\u201d Ms. Whitmer said.\n\nThe state\u2019s e-cigarette ban will be filed in coming weeks and take immediate effect. Retailers will have 30 days to comply. Tobacco-flavored products are exempt from the ban.\n\nThe ban will be in effect for six months, and can be renewed for another six months to allow state officials to develop permanent rules to ban e-cigarettes.\n\nAdvocacy groups such as the American Lung Association and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said Michigan has taken \u201cnecessary and appropriate emergency action\u201d to combat the youth e-cigarette epidemic.\n\nThe groups called on other states and cities to prohibit the sale of all flavored e-cigarettes until the Food and Drug Administration exercises \u201cstrict regulatory oversight of e-cigarettes,\u201d noting \u201cmore than 15,000 [flavors] on the market, from mango and mint to cotton candy and gummy bear \u2014 that hook [children] onto a highly addictive product.\u201d\n\nMichigan\u2019s move this week comes amid increasing cases of vaping-related lung illnesses and a report of a second death of a person who suffered a severe respiratory illness following use of an e-cigarette.\n\nOregon Health Authority officials said Tuesday they had received reports that the person, who died in July, recently had used an e-cigarette or vaping device containing cannabis purchased from a marijuana dispensary. Officials said the person\u2019s symptoms were similar to the more than 200 vaping-related lung illness cases reported nationwide.\n\nOregon\u2019s announcement follows the first death tied to vaping-related lung illness reported in Illinois last month.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported late last week 215 cases of lung illness linked to vaping in 25 states, with other cases being investigated.\n\nThe CDC said it is unclear if these cases have a common cause or if they are different diseases with similar symptoms. Many patients admitted to using e-cigarette products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, before being hospitalized.\n\nGregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, has said there is no evidence that ties counterfeit nicotine vaping products to lung illnesses, but several health departments are pointing to street-bought THC cartridges as a cause.\n\nHe called Michigan\u2019s ban a \u201cshameless attempt at back-door prohibition\u201d that will close hundreds of small businesses and send thousands of ex-smokers back to combustible cigarettes.\n\n\u201cThese businesses and their customers will not go down without a fight. We look forward to supporting the lawsuits that now appear necessary to protect the right of adults to access these harm reduction products,\u201d Mr. Conley said. \u201cAnyone who fears the prospect of an out-of-control government should be appalled by this attempt by the executive branch to unilaterally ban an adult product.\u201d\n\nTony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association, said Ms. Whitmer\u2019s decision is not based on science or common sense.\n\n\u201cScience demonstrates that flavors are not the reason youth illegally use vapor products. In fact, science demonstrates that flavors play a critical role in helping adult smokers quit deadly cigarettes,\u201d Mr. Abboud said, commenting on how Michigan\u2019s move will help create a black market.\n\nMichigan\u2019s e-cigarette ban follows a similar move by San Francisco, which enacted a citywide ban in June.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
