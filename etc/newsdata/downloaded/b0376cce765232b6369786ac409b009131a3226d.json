Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs debuted a \u201creport\u201d attacking the United States for its trade sanctions on the regime on Friday, in anticipation for next week\u2019s U.N. General Assembly general debate.\n\n\u201cThe Department of State today notified the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States requires the imminent departure of two members of Cuba\u2019s Permanent Mission to the United Nations for abusing their privileges of residence,\u201d Ortagus said in a statement. \u201cThis is due to their attempts to conduct influence operations against the United States.\u201d\n\nOrtagus did not name the individuals expelled from the country, but did say that all Cuban regime operatives at the U.N. mission \u201cwill now essentially be restricted to the island of Manhattan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take any and all attempts against the National Security of the United States seriously, and will continue to investigate any additional personnel who may be manipulating their privileges of residence,\u201d her statement concluded.\n\nThe Cuban regime has for decades abused the few diplomatic ties it is allowed in the United States for espionage and anti-American activities. In perhaps the most prominent modern example of Cuban spies threatening national security, a group of agents known as the \u201cCuban five\u201d infiltrated the Cuban exile community in Miami and gave Havana intelligence that allowed the Castro regime to kill four Americans. The men \u2013 Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Mario de la Pe\u00f1a, and Pablo Morales \u2013 were flying legal rescue missions in international waters when Castro agents shot their planes down; the \u201cCuban five\u201d\u2018s intelligence gave the Cuban military the information necessary to find the planes.\n\nDespite being a gross violation of international law, the Cuban government suffered no consequences for the murders. President Barack Obama freed the \u201cCuban five\u201d to a hero\u2019s welcome in Havana in 2014. Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal is currently starring in a film glorifying the work the spies did to kill the Americans.\n\nThe Cuban Foreign Ministry (MINREX) issued an outraged tweet in response to the expulsion.\n\n\u201cI categorically reject the unjustified expulsion of two officials at the Permanent Mission of Cuba at the U.N. and the hardening of restrictions of movement on diplomats and families,\u201d Foreign Ministry Bruno Rodr\u00edguez said on Twitter. \u201cThe implication that they committed acts incompatible with their diplomatic status is a vulgar calumny.\u201d\n\nRodr\u00edguez held a press conference Friday where he claimed he found out about the expulsion through a U.S. diplomatic tweet. He claimed the move triggered \u201cabsolute and energetic rejection from our people, our ministry, and our government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is totally unjustified and illegitimate to strongarm our diplomats,\u201d he complained.\n\nRodr\u00edguez went on to call the Trump administration \u201ca reactionary, anti-Cuban group that has hijacked American foreign policy on Cuba and Latin America\u201d and accused Trump of lashing out at Cuba for \u201celectoral interests\u201d \u2013 implying that strengthening national security defenses would help Trump win the 2020 election.\n\nThe Permanent Mission to the U.N. representing Cuba put out its own statement denying any wrongdoing, then admitting that American officials had notified it that the two individuals in question were caught engaging in damaging acts to U.S. national security on September 12, about a week before any statements on Twitter to that effect.\n\n\u201cThe note said that, unless Cuba lent information to justify [their behavior] otherwise, they [the U.S.] would ask for the necessary planning to occur for the departure of the two officials and their families within 48 hours, before the end of the day on September 20,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe mission claims to have responded with their explanation for the officials\u2019 behavior, \u201cbut the U.S. side, in flagrant violation of the basic principles of diplomatic protocol, decided to respond in a tweet.\u201d\n\nThe expulsions are acts of \u201cvengeance and impotence,\u201d the mission concluded.\n\nThe diplomatic scuffle comes on the eve of a week of debate at the U.N. General Assembly, where most of the world\u2019s heads of state are invited to take the floor and talk about whatever they want. America grants dictators and international criminals who hold head of state status immunity to attend the event, resulting in leaders like Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel \u2013 who is not the head of state of Cuba, but nonetheless holds the title of \u201cpresident\u201d \u2013 addressing the assembly last year to bash America for \u201cimperialism.\u201d\n\nFollowing a speech in which President Donald Trump urged the world to reconsider socialism, D\u00edaz-Canel contended that the world\u2019s horrors were \u201cthe consequence of capitalism, especially imperialism and neoliberalism, of the egoism and exclusion that accompany this system, and of an economic, political, social, and cultural paradigm that privileges that accumulation of wealth in few hands at the cost of exploitation and misery of the masses.\u201d\n\nWhile in New York, D\u00edaz-Canel enjoyed a star-studded welcome organized by Robert Do Niro and concluded the trip with a night of salsa dancing.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The U.S. Department of State announced on Thursday it had expelled two diplomats representing Cuba for threatening national security.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/wi/afp/19/71187e_explusion-cuban-diplomats-as-united-nations-holds-its-74th-assembly-in-e1569014619430-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
