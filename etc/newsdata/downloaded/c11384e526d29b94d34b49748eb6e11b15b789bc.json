It waits until the door is shut and the lights are out, and even then, it bides its time. Pulses race, sweat beads, no move seems the right one.\n\nThe first eight years of my life were spent in the sprawling farmlands of Howell, Mich., and I learned firsthand that uncertainty is a constant.\n\nMy father scratched out a living selling Ford pickups to farmers, and the line chart tracking his income through the late 1970s and early 1980s mimics a roller coaster that rises and falls alongside inflation, weather patterns, oil shocks and trade embargoes.\n\nFor corporate executives, fear today about tariffs has displaced fear about fiscal policy, which displaced fear about government regulation, which displaced fear about geopolitical shifts, which displaced fear about market volatility and so forth.\n\nShare Your Thoughts In your experience, is it better to act or wait in times of uncertainty? Join the conversation below.\n\nLet\u2019s consider for a moment that the Uncertainty Monster, as climate scientist Judith Curry refers to it, has proven to be as much of a friend as it is a foe. She argues that debates about the rate and cause of global warming can get so extreme and contentious that it creates indecision about how to address the problem. Instead of taking baby steps toward solutions, we let uncertainty paralyze us.\n\nThe same moral applies to broader business issues. You\u2019ll miss a lot if you spend all your time focusing on the unknown.\n\n\u201cUncertainty comes with plenty of upside,\u201d Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist, told me this week.\n\nMr. Bloom conducts regular studies published by the Atlanta Federal Reserve that track just how uncertain we are, and his World Uncertainty Index, developed for the International Monetary Fund, suggests we are suffering from near-historic heights of uncertainty.\n\nThis is when it would be good to remember we\u2019ve been here before.\n\nThink back just a little earlier in this decade about how then-unprecedented levels of uncertainty, caused by the 2008 financial crisis, were still wreaking havoc even as the economy boomed. Executives, burdened by concerns about the European Union debt crisis and fragility of America\u2019s recovery, were slow-walking investments, hiring and expansion.\n\nWarren Buffett in 2012 warned against being paralyzed by uncertainty.

Withholding investment when confidence is shaky is a recipe for being underprepared when everyone\u2019s confidence returns. For instance, the same manufacturers or retailers who scrimped back then were forced to scurry to hire and buy new equipment later in the decade.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of hand-wringing last year among CEOs who cried \u2018uncertainty\u2019 when faced with capital allocation decisions (despite many of their businesses having enjoyed record levels of both earnings and cash),\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in that 2012 letter. \u201cWe didn\u2019t share their fears.\u201d His firm loves \u201cinvesting large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits are saying.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Bloom said 2019\u2019s concerns are a unique brand of fear because many of them are founded by trade disputes between the world\u2019s two largest economies, China and the U.S. The tariff implications are unprecedented and hard to calculate.\n\nStill, it would be foolish to forget the level of uncertainty that ran through business when crises such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the bursting of the dot-com bubble created a cloud over the entire economy.\n\nAs many executives fretted in the late 1990s and early 2000s over what the internet would grow into, how risky internet investments were proving to be, and at what speed the online world was evolving, certain entrepreneurs started building empires. Three of the top-five valued companies in the world\u2014Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014were started or expanded within a couple years of the dot-com bubble bursting.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos is an evangelist for math-based decision making, and has said that much of what you need to know can be derived from data. However, a lack of concrete information isn\u2019t an excuse for inaction.\n\n\u201cAll of my best decisions in business and in life have been made with heart, intuition, guts; not analysis,\u201d Mr. Bezos said last September during an appearance at the Economic Club of Washington that I attended. He left a job at a New York hedge fund to start a website selling books in 1995, a time when many questioned whether consumers would spend a dime on products they had never held from a business they had never entered.\n\n\u201cThere is always unknown,\u201d wrote Chet Pipkin, who founded Belkin International, in an email this week. \u201cAs the unknown becomes known, a choice is to expect it, welcome it, embrace it, and make choices that create a new competitive advantage.\u201d This is wisdom that the founders of WeWork, Airbnb, Slack and Uber\u2014all starting their companies during or in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis\u2014seemed to live by.\n\nAirstream\u2019s production facility in Jackson Center, Ohio.

Recently, while touring Airstream\u2019s recreational vehicle factory in Jackson Center, Ohio, I was surprised to learn about the decision to build a new plant on nearby vacant land. It was late 2018, a time when threats of punishing tariffs combined with a slowdown in RV deliveries were giving executives ample excuse to hold off on sinking big money in hard assets that take years to pay off.\n\nI later asked Bob Martin, chief executive of Airstream\u2019s parent Thor Industries , about his logic. Mr. Martin said his business is always facing uncertainty. Dealers order too much, causing an inventory glut. Summer gets off to a cool start, softening demand for $100,000 trailers. Investors pay guys like him to think longer-term, he said.\n\nSame goes for the high seas.\n\nCarnival Corp. CEO Arnold Donald spent his career in agriculture but more recently took the corner office at the cruise operator, which sends ships to hundreds of ports around the world. Being able to plan for a long list of unknowns is core to his job.\n\nGeopolitical disruptions or currency fluctuations are among the many variables he has to deal with. Hurricanes, tsunamis and cold snaps are also top of mind.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that shareholders don\u2019t care about the weather,\u201d Mr. Donald said. \u201cWe need to assume bad weather and make a plan to deal with that. We\u2019ve got to ask ourselves how are we going to organize so we can deliver?\u201d\n\nWrite to John D.
