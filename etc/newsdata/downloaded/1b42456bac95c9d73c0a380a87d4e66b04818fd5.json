Lucy declared it an easy 5.7 with a tough dyno finish.'\n\nKarla Hancock, Lucy's mother, said her daughter was climbing the replica in Kentucky for a preliminary testing session before a competition\n\nLucy (pictured) reportedly called the wall 'an easy 5.7' and finished the climb with a 'tough dyno finish'\n\nSocial media users have called Lucy a 'tough girl' and 'fantastic.'\n\nOne woman said: 'I think Lucy could climb anything she put her mind do.'\n\nRick Weber, co-founder of Muir Valley rock climbing park in Rogers, built the replica after hearing Trump' s statement and took it as a challenge.\n\nWeber told Time: 'You don't tell a bona fide rock climber something's impossible to climb.'\n\nThe wall was built by Rick Weber, co-founder of Muir Valley, after he heard Trump say the dimensions of the border wall were 'impenetrable'\n\nHe built a replica of the wall using the wall's official dimensions and recent photos of the structure to create his own version for 'Rocktoberfest', a rock climbing festival in Kentucky.\n\nAccording to Weber, one man scaled the replica wall in 40 seconds and the group of climbers are confused by Trump's claims that 20 mountain climbers said the wall was difficult.\n\n'We were all very puzzled because none of us in the climbing community had heard of these 20 people that had supposedly tried this wall,' Weber said.", "description": "8-year-old Lucy Hancock from South Carolina scaled an 18-foot tall replica of President Trump's border wall in under one minute - despite Trump's claims that the wall is 'impenetrable'", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/02/19567202-0-image-a-58_1570757609231.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
