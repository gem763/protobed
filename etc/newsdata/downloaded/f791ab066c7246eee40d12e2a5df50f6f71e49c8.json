For instance, in the heat of the moment, you may forget that it\u2019s not you versus your partner but rather you both as a team against your problem. Or you may end up bullying your partner or outsmarting them in a disagreement which again doesn\u2019t help to resolve the conflict but just makes the bullied compliant and bitter. Speaking in a loud voice, taunts and sarcasm do more harm than good. So then how do you approach conflict? If things get heated, do you take a break and come back to it after some time? Do you think over it before voicing it out? What if it isn\u2019t a conflict but just a stressful situation for your partner which is causing them to snap? How do you then be there for them?", "description": "Getting to know your fianc\u00e9 before the wedding, understanding their dreams and expectations pays way to a smoother married life", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/weddings-01-sm-thumb1571050782.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
