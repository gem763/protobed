On their eighth EP Feel Special, the gang of nine really get into their groove across seven tracks of upbeat, and energetic pop tunes.\n\nVideo of TWICE \"Feel Special\" M/V\n\nThe girls really break into their stride mid-way through Trick It. The \u201cAh-ha ah-ha ah-ha\u201d singalong really cranks it over blaring house chords and mad triangle work. With its shifting beats, this tune provides the record\u2019s catchiest moments, and is K-pop at its finest.\n\nLove Foolish is equally impressive, but with more atmospheric EDM stylings: sidechain compression is used to create a bouncing wave of surging synth-pop, plus there\u2019s a spoken word chorus \u2013 \u201cCrazy love/I love you/Love you, hate foolish\u201d \u2013 which sits perfectly in this genre.\n\nMonsta-X prove phenomenal on Phenomenon Japanese album\n\nCloser Breakthough, which was released earlier this year as a single, appears, but as a Korean version, and it\u2019s a real brass-led banger; 21:29 is an amalgamation of retro soul, lounge, R\u2019n\u2019B and 90s hip hop, with dreamy vocals. It\u2019s these ambitious style-blends which seem to pay off the most.\n\nThe opening tracks show less variety, but are still decent. Rainbow features a refreshingly novel British garage beat, while the title track is a jumpy, party-pop bop with countless layers of synth arpeggios bubbling through.\n\nMany acts fall flat by trying to squeeze too many sounds into a song, but this is where TWICE flourish, and when they\u2019re on top form like this, they really do sound and feel special.", "description": "The band's eighth release shows the South Korean idols know how to keep the party pumping, successfully mixing genres in a way most other acts cannot.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/twice2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
