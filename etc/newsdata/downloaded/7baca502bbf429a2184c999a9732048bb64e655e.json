He bragged about the confrontation on social media.\n\n\u201cAn old white lady, telling people what is right to do with their bodies,\" he wrote. \"Shame on you. Shame.\u201d\n\nHe even offered $100 to any of his social media followers who could identify the activists.\n\nIn this video, State Rep @BrianSimsPA says he\u2019ll pay his followers $100 if they are able to dox three teen girls he films who are quietly praying outside a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic. How is this guy still allowed to be on Twitter? pic.twitter.com/yfNCHhRSqY \u2014 Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) May 6, 2019\n\nIt's been five months since he bullied the praying demonstrators and Sims has finally penned an apology for Garecht and her family.\n\n\u201cDear Ashley, I want to reiterate my sincere apologies to you and your family,\" he wrote on a small note card. \"I regret the harm that I caused and I have learned a great deal from this. I can only ask for your forgiveness and I wish you all the best in the future. Sincerely, Brian Sims.\u201d\n\nBefore you jump to the conclusion that he's had a change of heart and deeply regrets his actions, consider the timing of the apology. It wasn't until Sims was facing a potential censure from the Pennsylvania state legislature that he said he was sorry. With his apology now public, State Rep. Jerry Knowles said he was withdrawing his censure legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that it took more than five months for Rep. Sims to acknowledge he did something very wrong, but he did finally apologize to the people he bullied, harassed and doxed at the Philadelphia abortion clinic,\u201d Knowles said.\n\nDespite its very delayed arrival, Garecht and her family graciously accepted his apology.\n\n\"We take him at his word, and we have already forgiven him,\" said Joe Garecht, Ashley Garecht's husband.\n\nSims is the same guy who took a photo of himself giving Vice President Mike Pence the middle finger upon his visit to Philadelphia in June 2018. Sims, who is openly gay, thought flipping the bird was the best way to oppose Pence's traditionalist views.\n\n\"Get bent, then get out!\" Sims told Pence.", "description": ".10/30/2019 19:13:42PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/117/92efba4a-418d-4f33-bb72-edb750a0811a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
