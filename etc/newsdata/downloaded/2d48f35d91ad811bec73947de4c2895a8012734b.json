That is the highest level in three months.\n\n\u201cThe focus of consumers has been on income and job growth, while largely ignoring other news,\u201d Richard Curtin, the survey\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement. \u201cThe most spontaneous references were to the negative impact of tariffs, which fell to 27 percent in October from last month\u2019s 36 percent; the impeachment inquiry totaled just 2% in October, less than the 5% who mentioned a negative impact from the GM strike.\u201d\n\nPrior to the midmonth preliminary report from the University of Michigan, which saw the index rising to 96, economists surveyed by Econoday had forecast a decline to 92.\n\n\u201cSentiment rebounded in early October as consumers anticipated larger income gains and lower inflation during the year ahead. As a result, real income expectations rose to their most favorable level in two decades,\u201d Richard Curtin, the survey\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement issued after the midmonth report.\n\nThe index\u2019s current situation component rose sharply in the first weeks of September, hitting 113.2 from 108.5, the highest level this year. The expectations component, which asks consumers to forecast conditions six months from now, ticked up from 83.4 to 84.2.", "description": "Consumers are focused on jobs and income, not letting the impeachment drama shake their optimism about the economy. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1044466418-e1572014230134-638x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
