But most of the money going to support Bishop also comes from outside of North Carolina.\n\nVoters in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District will vote Tuesday in their latest attempt to elect a U.S. Representative. The 2018 midterm election result was thrown out due to election fraud by the then-Republican nominee\u2019s campaign and the seat has been vacant since January. Experts say the race is a toss-up, despite the district being one Trump carried by 11 points in 2016.\n\nOn Thursday, Bishop went on Fox News and was asked about a new bipartisan poll that showed him trailing Democratic nominee Dan McCready by a 46 to 42 margin.\n\n\u201cMy opponent has been running for 27, 28 months,\u201d he answered, \u201cand he has been funded by $12 million, tons of money from outside the district. A lot from California, New York and New Jersey. A lot of it from hard-left sources.\u201d\n\nBut most of the money in support of Bishop in the race has also come from outside of the Ninth District and the Tar Heel state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics reported that while McCready has outraised Bishop in the race, outside spending by super PACs, party committees, and dark money groups has significantly favored the Republican nominee.\n\nThe report noted that the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, had already spent $1.1 million on the race and had reportedly reserved a total of $2.6 million in air time for commercials. \u201cTwo conservative super PACs \u2014 the Congressional Leadership Fund and Club for Growth Action \u2014 have also thrown their support behind Bishop, spending a combined $1.3 million on the race.\u201d\n\nAnd a ThinkProgress review of Bishop\u2019s own campaign finance filings found that he had taken tens of thousands of dollars from out of state Republican politicians including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Doug LaMalfa (both of California) and Rep. Lee Zeldin (of New York).\n\nBishop was asked about Trump\u2019s planned campaign visit to the district prior to Tuesday\u2019s special election and whether it was needed for him to win.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Bishop admitted. \u201cThe president is going to come down and communicate to the people who love Donald Trump and support him as president and want him to accomplish the things he set out to do. They need to hear from him and so we\u2019re delighted he is coming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBishop is currently a state senator. He is best known for spearheading passage of the state\u2019s anti-LGBTQ HB2 in 2016 \u2014 a law that cost the state\u2019s economy billions. He was also an early investor in Gab, an online platform popular among white nationalists.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1162747053.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
