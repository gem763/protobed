The Metropolitan police now accepts that all three men are innocent and falsely accused by Carl Beech, originally known as \u201cNick\u201d, who in July was jailed for 18 years for his lies.\n\nQuick guide What was Operation Midland and how did it go wrong? Show Hide What was Operation Midland? Operation Midland was set up by the Metropolitan police in November 2014 to examine allegations of child sexual abuse and homicide. It was based on false claims by Carl Beech, known as \"Nick\", that he was abused by public figures of authority from 1975 to 1984, and witnessed the abuse of others. He made widely reported false allegations about being taken to parties at exclusive private members\u2019 clubs, in Dolphin Square in London and other locations \u2013 including swimming pools \u2013 attended by among others the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, the former home secretary Leon Brittan, the then chief of defence staff Lord Bramall, the ex-MI5 chief Sir Michael Hanley, as well as the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. Operation MIdland was closed in March 2016 with no charges brought. Beech was jailed for 18 years in July 2019 for making the claims. He is appealing against the conviction and the sentence.\n\nA 2016 report into the investigation said it was \u2018riddled with errors\u2019, identifying 43 individual errors made by officers, that the team misled a judge to get search warrants, and finding that five officers, including four detectives and a deputy assistant commissioner, would be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for failings.\n\n\n\nThe report describes how police came to apply for search warrants, leading to property linked to Brittan being raided after his death. Police were accused of misleading a judge to get them by omitting mention of inconsistencies in Nick\u2019s account.\n\nThe IOPC said a Met police chief, deputy assistant commissioner Steve Rodhouse, wrote that among reasons to apply for the warrants was \u201ca perceived failure to investigate Nick\u2019s allegations being damaging to the MPS and the confidence of further victims\u201d.\n\nIt reveals the decision log of DCI Diane Tudway who wrote on 23 January 2015, the day after Brittan\u2019s death: \u201cWhilst he has now passed away, he remains a suspect for the purpose of this enquiry.\n\n\u201cHad he not passed away he would have been subject to a decision to arrest. Whilst arrest will now not happen I have grounds to believe that there were indictable offences committed, that there is material at those premises which will be of substantive value to the investigation either by way of a record of events, photographs or videos.\u201d\n\nTudway\u2019s decision log continued: \u201cI understand this is a time of mourning for LB\u2019s [Lord Brittan\u2019s] family, this plan will be HR [human rights] compliant.\u201d\n\nThe report says a decision was made to \u201coffer a voluntary interview to Lord Bramall and Mr Proctor rather than to arrest\u201d.\n\nThe detail of the IOPC report shows the decision to seek search warrants was approved by Rodhouse: \u201cIt is outlined that the purpose of the searches would be to locate and secure any evidence to \u2018corroborate (or discredit)\u2019 the allegations made by \u2018Nick\u2019.\n\n\u201cDuring the consideration of his decision, he wrote that, despite the lack of corroboration, the investigation had not revealed any cause to disbelieve \u2018Nick\u2019. DAC Rodhouse recorded that \u2018Nick\u2019 had remained consistent and detailed in his accounts and that he had been told that the inquiry team and his counsellor believed him to be credible.\u201d\n\nThe IOPC said it had found \u201cshortcomings and organisational failings\u201d, with 16 recommendations made to change policing practice. But it said it found no evidence officers had deliberately misled a district court judge when it applied for search warrants in February 2015 to raid the home of suspects who turned out to be innocent.\n\nOfficers on Midland believed the search warrants were \u201cthe least intrusive way in which the investigation could progress\u201d, the report says.\n\nOn the application for the search warrants, police wrote in a section where they had to say why they believed offences had been committed: \u201cThe victim in this matter has been interviewed at length by experienced officers from the child abuse investigation team. His account has remained consistent and he is felt to be a credible witness who is telling the truth.\u201d\n\nThe IOPC says during its inquiry, the detectives could not remember why certain decisions were made and it was not clear whether those in command knew of an earlier complaint from Beech, made to Wiltshire police, which contained inconsistencies compared with what he told the Met two years later.\n\nThe report says Rodhouse wrote that reasons for applying for search warrants at an early stage included: \u201cThe high degree of public interest \u2026 The allegations, and the named subjects were already well-known to the media \u2026 Nick himself having direct access to the media\u2026A perceived failure to investigate \u2018Nick\u2019s\u2019 allegations being damaging to the MPS and the confidence of further victims\u201d.\n\nThe IOPC inquiry began after the Metropolitan police referred five officers who had been involved in Operation Midland to the police watchdog. Only one answered questions face to face, two had retired and Rodhouse and Det Supt Kenny McDonald were assessed by the IOPC as not requiring full investigation for any discipline or criminal matters.\n\nThe high-profile Met investigation ran from 2014 to 2016 and hunted for establishment figures alleged to have been involved in a child sexual abuse and murder ring, which turned out to be based on lies from a fantasist. It ended with no arrests.\n\nThe Met has paid compensation to Bramall and to Brittan\u2019s family but has yet to finalise a deal with Proctor.\n\nA report commissioned for the Met and carried out by the retired judge Sir Richard Henriques castigated the force and found 43 errors. The key error, Henriques said, was that police misled a judge to get warrants to search suspects\u2019 homes.\n\nMichael Lockwood, director general of the IOPC, said: \u201cDid the officers involved make mistakes? Yes. Could police processes have been improved? Almost certainly. But did they deliberately exclude information to secure the warrants? Our investigation found no evidence of that.\n\n\u201cThe IOPC is very clear that there must be accountability and assurance to the public that the weaknesses we have identified are addressed so these mistakes can never be repeated. Our report makes 16 recommendations for the MPS and other stakeholders in the police and criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nProctor, one of Operation Midland\u2019s targets, attacked the police watchdog\u2019s findings, saying: \u201cThis report shows the IOPC is worse than useless. It actually defends the police against the authoritative findings of Henriques because they wanted to boost public confidence in themselves.\n\n\u201cThe home secretary should remove the IOPC director general and the IOPC must be abolished and replaced by experts who are genuinely qualified to assess and to criticise police failings. We now know the police watchdog is blind.\u201d\n\nHenriques also criticised the IOPC\u2019s findings before the police watchdog published its report, writing in the Daily Mail: \u201cMaintenance of law and order depends upon the effective oversight of those invested with power. Who guards the guards themselves? A malfunctioning police force has not received the necessary oversight.\u201d\n\nHenriques claimed the IOPC investigator who conducted the case \u201cinformed me she had no legal training [and] was not fully aware of the process for obtaining warrants\u201d.\n\nThe retired judge added: \u201cThe investigative process itself was minimal, unprofessional and the decision-making was flawed.\u201d\n\nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, has asked the inspectorate of constabulary to check the Met is carrying out reforms recommended by both the IOPC and Henriques.", "description": "Watchdog faces claims of whitewash over report on botched Scotland Yard investigation", "authors": ["Vikram Dodd"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ed8e1e85f2bd0895c07a5d7d6a10cca3bcc8884/0_74_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72372d5a1cf8668f0ea780ac433bf44e", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
