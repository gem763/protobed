The US dollar gained against all G10 currencies.\n\ngained on softer Japanese yen. rallied 1.19% despite another weekend of protests in Hong Kong. Shanghai\u2019s Composite added 0.72%.\n\nHSBC (LON: ), however, missed analyst estimates in the and announced significant restructuring charges as part of its struggle with weakening global outlook.\n\nslipped below the 7300p following the HSBC\u2019s miss, hinting at a soft start in London.\n\nElsewhere, the yield advanced to 1.80%, while gold held support above the $1500 an ounce.\n\nMore US companies will reveal earnings this week, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) on Monday, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday.\n\nGoooooooogle\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc Class C (NASDAQ: ) will release its after the market close and the expectations are solid. Google\u2019s earnings are expected to have increased to $12.317 per share, versus $11.660 printed a quarter earlier. Google is gaining momentum on its cloud business and have recently announced significant improvements on its research engine. The company said on Friday that its new research system relies on artificial intelligence to parse complex sentences, instead of a suite of key words.\n\nAs such, Google (NASDAQ: ) has probably not been jammed by the slowing global conjuncture, even less by the US-China trade war, because its services are already fully blocked in China. Although, the company has its own headaches with the ongoing antitrust allegations, investors continue believing in Google\u2019s power to post continued strength in revenues.\n\n87% of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg recommend buying the Google (NASDAQ: ) stock, 13% remain on hold with a twelve-month average target price of $1426. There is no sell recommendation.\n\nHence, good results could send the Google\u2019s share price to fresh all-time highs, above the $1300 tested in April, and boost gains across the US tech stocks.\n\nA hawkish rate cut for the Fed?\n\nThe is expected to lower its by another 25 basis points on Wednesday with 90% probability according to the activity on the US sovereign markets. While lower rates should give a piece of mind to investors about the slowdown worries amid trade tensions, the record-high equity prices raise some questions about the future of the Fed\u2019s policy. With the S&P500 up by 30% since its December dip, the Fed could be tempted to take a pause after this week\u2019s cut. A hawkish rate cut, on the other hand, could curb the appetite in equity and bond markets, and push the US 10-year yield toward the 2% mark.\n\nOil markets fueled by lower output prospects, improved risk appetite\n\ncrude peaked at $56.85 a barrel on increased risk appetite. Buyers are slowly taking over the reins of the market on expectations that OPEC and its allies would announce further production cuts at their December meeting.\n\nUS data published on weekly basis could cause some volatility in short-term prices, but the overall outlook turns encouraging for long positions. The net speculative long positions in crude increased in the NYME during the week that ended on 22 October, yet the actual net long positions are still near four-month lows.\n\nEnergy stocks (+0.86%) led gains in Sydney on Monday.\n\nIn the UK, investors\u2019 attention turns to British energy company\u2019s third quarter performances. BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) are due to release their third quarter results on and respectively. Expectations are low as the weakening global demand may have taken a toll on British oil giants\u2019 profits during the third quarter.\n\nD-3\n\nWe are just three days away from the Brexit deadline and there is no final agreement on the Brexit deal, or a guaranteed delay.\n\nThe pound is down for the third consecutive session against the US dollar, as uncertainties regarding the extension of the Brexit deadline and Johnson\u2019s call for a snap election have been weighing on the bullish sentiment.\n\nThe European Union has proposed the extension of the Brexit deadline to January 31st, with the flexibility to part ways on November 30th or December 31st if both sides agree. But nothing is sure. French President Emanuel Macron, for example, insists that the UK should be given no more than a month to sort it all out, while others believe that a three-month extension would be fine. Europeans will continue discussing the matter among themselves on Monday and they are due to announce their final verdict on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, British lawmakers will decide whether to accept Boris Johnson\u2019s early election call on December 12. Johnson will probably fall short of the two-thirds majority that he needs to throw a snap election. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn wants to make sure that a no-deal Brexit wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nAs it stands today, the probability of a no-deal Brexit is very slim. From the market perspective, a no-deal scenario is almost fully reflected in sterling prices near the 1.30 mark against the US dollar.\n\nPound traders have further trimmed their net short positions during the week that ended on October 22nd and have already moved on to pricing Britain\u2019s next political challenges.\n\nWhile a three-month extension may not trigger a rally in sterling, a shorter delay could accelerate a deeper downside correction toward the critical 1.27 level against the greenback, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement which should distinguish between the actual bullish consolidation and a mid-term bearish trend reversal.\n\nThe sees demand below the 7300p level, as eyes turn to corporate earnings.
