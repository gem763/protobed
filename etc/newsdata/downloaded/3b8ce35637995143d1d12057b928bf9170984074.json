In October 2016, for example, prices increased by \u00a39,100 across the year.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a home in the U.K. is now \u00a3215,368.\n\n\n\nThe pace of growth has slowed in the face of weaker global growth and intensifying Brexit uncertainty, the report said.\n\n\n\nBrexit had been scheduled for Oct. 31, until Monday, and which point it was announced that the deadline had been extended again, until Jan. 31, 2020.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Future Returns: Real Estate Remains a Good Bet in Some Hong Kong Sectors\n\n\u201cMuch like the walking dead, the U.K. property market continues to plod on through the thick fog of Brexit uncertainty, showing little signs of resurrection to former levels,\u201d said Shepherd Ncube, founder and CEO of estate agency Springbok Properties, in a statement in response to the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, like a proverbial Michael Myers of \u2018Halloween\u2019 movie notoriety, it is still refusing to actually die, and while current price growth may seem insignificant, we are still in a better position than we were this time last year,\u201d he said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-121787?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
