It includes scrapping the controversial Irish backstop and replacing it with a new customs arrangement.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal has not yet been approved by the UK Parliament\n\nBrexit has left the Conservative Party heavily divided, with 21 of its MPs expelled for failing to follow the government's line on Brexit.\n\nLabour - 244 MPs\n\nIf it wins an election, Labour wants to renegotiate Mr Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote.\n\nLabour says its referendum would be a choice between a \"credible\" Leave option versus Remain.\n\nUnder its Leave option, Labour says it will negotiate for the UK to remain in an EU customs union, and retain a \"close\" single market relationship.\n\nThis would allow the UK to continue trading with the EU without checks, but it would prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nIf a referendum was held, Mr Corbyn has not said which way he would vote, although he has pledged \"to carry out whatever the people decide\".\n\nOther senior figures, including shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, have said they favour remaining in the EU.\n\nJust like the Conservatives, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be \"toxic to our bedrock Labour voters\".\n\nSNP - 35 MPs\n\nThe SNP is pro-Remain and wants the UK to stay a member of the EU.\n\nIt has been campaigning for another referendum on Brexit.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is \"catastrophic\"\n\nThe SNP's ultimate objective is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the EU.\n\nLiberal Democrats - 19 MPs\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexit if they win power at the next general election.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Party leader Jo Swinson says a Lib Dem majority government would cancel Brexit\n\nThe policy was endorsed in September by party members at the Lib Dem party conference.\n\nThe Lib Dems say they will continue to work with other parties to try to bring about a referendum before an election is called.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party - 10 MPs\n\nThe DUP had an agreement with the Conservatives whereby it lent it support in the Commons.\n\nHowever, while the DUP wants the UK to leave the EU, it is unhappy with the revised deal negotiated by Mr Johnson.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption DUP leader Arlene Foster says a solution based on technology could replace the backstop\n\nIt's worried that the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK could be threatened, because Northern Ireland would have to stick to some EU rules.\n\nThe DUP wanted to be given a veto, so that it had the option to reject the new customs arrangement in the future.\n\nThe Independent Group for Change - 5 MPs\n\nThis party is made up of MPs who left the Conservatives and Labour, in part because of their positions on Brexit.\n\nThey back another referendum, or \"People's Vote\", and want the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nPlaid Cymru - 4 MPs\n\nThe party backs remaining in the EU, despite Wales voting \"out\" in the referendum. It wants a further referendum and to Remain.\n\nGreen Party - 1 MP\n\nThe party's one MP, Caroline Lucas, has been a vocal campaigner for another referendum, and believes the UK should stay in the EU.\n\nBrexit Party - 0 MPs\n\nThe Brexit Party wants the UK to leave the EU without a deal, in what it calls a \"clean-break Brexit\".\n\nIt says Mr Johnson's revised Brexit plan is a bad deal because it would still involve paying the EU a \u00a339bn settlement.\n\nIf the Conservatives embrace no-deal, the Brexit Party says it would be willing to form an electoral pact.\n\nHowever, if that offer is not taken up, it says its candidates will stand in seats across the country.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button\n\nBrexit explained\n\nBrexit - British exit - refers to the UK leaving the EU.
