A volunteer trudged more than half a mile over debris to where an air-conditioning unit and piles of metal had trapped the survivor: a 1-year-old mixed-breed puppy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle this little dog had the will to live and to survive in the conditions he was in,\u201d Lauree Simmons, president and founder of Big Dog Ranch Rescue, said Monday.\n\nAD\n\nEmployees at this Florida bar pulled about $14,000 off the walls \u2014 and they\u2019re donating it to Hurricane Dorian relief\n\nThe puppy discovered Friday in Marsh Harbour, formerly the most densely populated neighborhood on Great Abaco Island, was among more than 150 animals the rescue group has flown to the United States from the Bahamas since the hurricane. Often, Simmons said, the organization finds the pets on the spots where their homes once stood. They\u2019ve reunited some animals with their owners, while other pets wait for new homes.\n\nAD\n\nRescuers had been looking for specific dogs with known owners when they stumbled upon the trapped puppy. Volunteer Sean Irion sat with him for a few minutes, letting him lick dog food out of a can, to gain his trust. His ribs showed through his light brown fur.\n\n\u201cLook at that tail wagging!\u201d Irion said to the dog, according to a video of the rescue. \u201cWe\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIrion and another volunteer then heaved debris out of the way and gently placed a leash around the dog\u2019s neck. Irion picked up the dog, silent and unmoving, and carried him out of the wreckage.\n\nWhat makes dogs so special and successful? Love.\n\nSimmons\u2019s phone rang around 9:30 a.m. that day with a plea for help: Her volunteers had found an anemic dog \u2014 barely alive \u2014 and needed to fly him back to Florida immediately. She called the pilot whose planes Big Dog Ranch had been chartering, and her volunteers prepared the puppy for the flight.\n\nAD\n\nThe dog had survived only on rainwater that filled a hole in front of him after the hurricane, so rescuers gave him some fluids to stabilize him before the hour-long flight. When he arrived at Big Dog Ranch, Simmons said, his muscles had wasted away from a month of immobility and his body weight had plummeted from about 45 pounds to 22 pounds.\n\nAD\n\nHis care includes antibiotics, gradual feeding and physical therapy to help him regain his muscle tone. The road ahead of him is long, but Simmons said her organization expects the dog to make a full recovery.\n\nBig Dog Ranch plans to post the puppy\u2019s details on missing-dog websites that will give his owners 30 days to claim him. If no one comes forward, Simmons said, the organization will put him up for adoption.\n\nAnother dog found alongside the rescued mix-breed was dead when rescuers arrived. To Simmons, it\u2019s incredible that any dogs survived the disaster. The recovering puppy, she said, is a sign to families displaced by the tragedy that \u201cthere\u2019s hope for rebuilding and a new beginning.\u201d\n\nRescuers have named him \u201cMiracle.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA second chance: Dogs rescued 12 years ago from Vick\u2019s dogfighting operation have enriched lives\n\nA baby elephant died after falling into a waterfall.
