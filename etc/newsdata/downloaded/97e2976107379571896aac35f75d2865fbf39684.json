Here's Who's Spearheading The Effort.", "language": "en", "text": "The Democratic Coalition is determined to help oust President Donald Trump, which is why they launched the \"Impeachment Task Force,\" compromised of various celebrities. The goal of the \"Task Force\" is to provide political cover for Democrats wanting to hold Trump \"accountable for his betrayal of America,\" Democratic Coalition co-founder Scott Dwork told Newsweek.\n\nNot surprisingly, the anti-Trump celebrities compromising the \"Task Force\" include actors and actresses who have been outspoken about their disdain for Trump. Confirmed members include comedian Rosie O'Donnell and actors Tom Arnold, Ron Perlman, George Takei, Debra Messing and Alyssa Milano.\n\nOther confirmed famous task force members are musician Stefan Lessard, authors Grant Stern and Lea Black and former tennis player Martina Navratilova. Celebrities in the left-wing movement The Resistance and VoteVets will be involved, as well as former FBI assistant director Frank Figliuzzi, former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, former congressman David Jolly, gun control activist Fred Guttenberg, patient advocate Peter Morley and progressive activist and lawyer Ady Barkan.\n\nSome of them have been outspoken about their opposition to Trump.\n\nI\u2019m glad you clarified the below tweet by using \u201cwhistleblower\u201d. For a second, I didn\u2019t know if you wanted to meet with one of the over 20 women who\u2019ve accused you of sexual misconduct.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to keep track of all your accusers, @realDonaldTrump. Thanks for the clarification. https://t.co/lWPUXhz0qa \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) September 30, 2019\n\nLookie here. Seems like Trump also abused his power with Australia. https://t.co/CQtyRZc7Nb \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 1, 2019\n\nNow that that big hourglass in the sky is running out of sandpebbles for dear Comrade leader, it\u2019s time to turn our attention to every lowlife piece of shit scumbag in congress who defended his behavior as if to say it was OK. Patriotic. Standard. It never was. \u2014 Ron Perlman (@perlmutations) September 26, 2019\n\nObstruction of justice is not OK. Collusion if not OK. Contempt of Congress is not OK. Ripping children from parents and placing them in cages it\u2019s not OK. Robbing our children of a secure future on this planet for record breaking quarterly earnings is not OK. \u2014 Ron Perlman (@perlmutations) September 26, 2019\n\nYes! Absolutely! Corruption must be routed out wherever it rears its ugly head!

That\u2019s just the person who raised the alarm.\n\n\n\n3) Pack your bags. We\u2019re throwing you out, whether by impeachment or by vote. https://t.co/oQq2Z4QO3F \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 4, 2019\n\nThe group is planning is launch a full fledged campaign next week with more than 100 celebrities and 1,000 other members. Their focus will be on social media. Those celebrities who have more than 25,000 followers will be used in video conferences, conference calls and pushing the message on Twitter.\n\n\"A lot of these celebs have been attacked by Trump people or even by Trump personally, so he will be paying attention,\" Dworkin said.\n\nDwork ran a similar type of coalition in 2016 called Artists Against Trump, which had more than 100 actors and musicians.", "description": "Here we go..10/06/2019 20:06:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/233/f29f3628-a9b9-41e1-972e-0df2c6d426ac.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
