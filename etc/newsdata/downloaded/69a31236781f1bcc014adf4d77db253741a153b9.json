Doing it while sipping a glass of the finest South African-made Methode Cap Classique (MCC).\n\nBecause bubbly can only be referred to as 'champagne' if, in fact, it was produced in Champagne, France, we refer to this delightful drink as MCC, even though it is made in the same style as champagne.\n\nSouth Africa produces sublime MCC. And celebrate it as often as we can. Whether it's at a bubbly festival or just an average balmy evening at home, this fizzy wonder is the alcoholic Soda Stream of our adulthood.\n\nREAD: Wine worth travelling for: The bubbly Plett Winelands route that you may not know about\n\nHere are some great spots to sip locally-produced bubbly today in celebration of World Champagne Day:\n\nAt home\n\nBuy one of these babies, the Colmant Brut Reserve NV.
