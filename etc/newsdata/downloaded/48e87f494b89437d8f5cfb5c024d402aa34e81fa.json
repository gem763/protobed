Jemaa el-Fnaa square in Marrakesh\u2019s medina quarter. Photo: Fethi Belaid/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s commonly understood that the best way to explore a new place is to go straight to the locals. Each week in the Urbanist, we take that wisdom one step further by seeking out not just locals but local experts \u2014 those who are especially well versed in their cities\u2019 newest and most noteworthy scenes \u2014 to give us insider recommendations. This week, we asked contemporary artist and photographer Hassan Hajjaj, who\u2019s been called the \u201cAndy Warhol of Marrakech,\u201d for his picks in the Moroccan city.\n\n\u201cMarrakech will wake up your senses to the fullest. It has a lot of personality. The lights, the people: that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a photographer\u2019s dream. My favorite things to photograph in Marrakech are people. When I\u2019m outside, I\u2019m like a tourist like everybody else, kind of curious. I might see a local barber shaving somebody\u2019s head in the market underneath a plastic canopy. The people of Marrakech are very special. They\u2019re very funny, they can joke. The food, if you can find the right places, is great. If you go to locally run places, you\u2019re gonna get more of a feel of the city. There\u2019s a rhythm within this city. I call it \u2018organized chaos.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHis Other Musts\n\nH o t e l El Fenn is one of the few riads in the medina with a swimming pool.

It\u2019s quite a few riads put together and very accessible to the medina and the Jemaa el-Fna square, less than a ten-minute walk. You still have this reflection of Morocco because of the riad, but the design is very contemporary \u2014 some rooms are accented with mid-century lamps and tables, Wassily chairs, and freestanding clawfoot tubs. Riad, which means garden in Arabic, is normally a big house for multiple families with a big garden in the middle. The inner garden or courtyard will have a fountain and lots of trees and plants. You can hear the sound of the water and birds inside the space. It\u2019s almost like living inside out.\u201d\n\nC a f \u00e9 This is what a proper nous nous coffee looks like. Photo: JOKER/Katharina Eglau/Ullstein Bild via Getty Images \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a caf\u00e9 culture here. Lots of business gets done in caf\u00e9 s, lots of hanging out, and friends meeting up. Cafe Extrablatt (Hivernage) has a great patio and a big Mediterranean menu. Plus, it\u2019s in a nice neighborhood, Gueliz. Order a nous nous \u2014 it\u2019s what locals order. It\u2019s half milk, half espresso. Cafe Bistro Laksour (Rue Lalla Fatima Zahra) is another great one. The space and menu are smaller than Extrablatt, but it\u2019s right at the doorway of the medina.\u201d\n\nM o r o c c a n R e s t a u r a n t s The offerings at Nomad (bottom left) and Amal.

Nomad (1 Derb Aarjane) is right in the middle of the old medina and looks over a small square. The restaurant has four floors but definitely sit on the rooftop terrace, where you can see the medina and Atlas mountain range. The food is very contemporary, like Moroccan gazpacho, sardine tart, and a spiced lamb burger. The Amal Center (Rue Allal Ben Ahmed) has a great restaurant in Gu\u00e9liz. It\u2019s run by women and part of a nonprofit organization that helps women through restaurant training. It\u2019s an old villa from the \u201930s that\u2019s turned into a restaurant. At Amal, they do a different dish every day, but on Fridays they do just couscous: chicken, beef, and vegetarian. That\u2019s a traditional day to eat couscous after mosque. The fine dining restaurant Dar Moha (81 Rue Dar El Bacha) is named after the chef Moha Fedal, who is said to have reinvented Moroccan cuisine. (The Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently ate there.) The food there is amazing. Dinner is prix fixe and includes pastilla, tagine, couscous, and desserts like caramelized-apple shakshouka and orange salad.\u201d\n\nM u s e u m s a n d G a l l e r i e s The Museum of African Contemporary Art Al Maaden. Photo: Omar Tajmouati/Courtesy of the Museum of African Contemporary Art Al Maaden \u201cComptoir des Mines Galerie (62 Rue Yougoslavie), run by Hicham Daoudi, is one the galleries that shows Morroccan contemporary artists. They have openings every few months in a beautiful 1930s building. Galerie 127 (127 Avenue Mohammed V) is a photography gallery run by Nathalie Locatelli. I think she has a brilliant eye for photography. There\u2019s also the Museum of African Contemporary Art Al Maaden (MACAAL), which is the newest museum for African art in Marrakech. At the moment, they\u2019re showing Mohamed Melehi. The Farid Belkahia Foundation is the house, and now museum, of a very famous artist who passed away two years ago. This year I\u2019m going to be showing my work there in an exhibition opening October 26 and introducing 15 Morrocccan photographers as a part of my show.\u201d\n\nS h o p p i n g Clockwise from top: Soufiane Zarib's showroom, Amine Bendriouich's shop at SHTATTO, and 33 Rue Majorelle.

He\u2019s more of an artist-designer. The patterns he does are really interesting. He plays around with different fabrics. Some of his designs are more like sculptures. He has a shop, Amine Bendriouich Welcome to the Kingdom, at the SHTATTO concept store (81 Derb Nkha) in the medina. At SHTATTO, there\u2019s three shops and a caf\u00e9 on the roof, which has a 360-degree view of Marrakech. It\u2019s a really nice place to shop and have a coffee. Yahya (61 Rue Yougoslavie) does very, very beautiful sculptural lights. They look very traditional, but there\u2019s something very special about them. They have a new shop in Gu\u00e9liz. It\u2019s like two minutes away from the Comptoir des Mines Galerie. Soufiane Zarib (16 Rue Sidi Ali Ben Hamdouch) is where you want to go for carpets. He has traditional hand-woven Berber carpets plus his own colorful, contemporary designs. The 33 Rue Majorelle concept store (33 Rue Yves St Laurent) has really interesting clothing from up-and-coming Moroccan brands and designers. There\u2019s a shop I really like called Beldi (9-11 Soukiat Laksour) that\u2019s doing beautiful cashmere and silks. It\u2019s very chic, very Moroccan, but the pieces don\u2019t look like traditional clothing that you get in the market.\u201d\n\nH a m m a m Moroccan black soap is made with olives. Photo: Smykalova Nataliia/Getty Images \u201cSpas here are a totally different experience. You\u2019ll either love it or it will be shocking. When my friends come, I usually take them to a very local one like Places des \u00e9pices (156-157, Derb A\u00e2rjane Rahba Lakdima) across from Nomad restaurant. There\u2019s a whole ritual of a hammam. You have to make sure you take your towel, your clean clothes, your shampoo, your soaps, a pair of plastic slippers, a small bucket you can wash yourself with. The most important thing to take is savon beldi, the Moroccan black soap. When you go in, there\u2019s three rooms. You go into the first room, which is the hot room, and sit there for maybe 5, 10, 15 minutes \u2014 whatever you can take \u2014 and then you put the black soap on you. You leave it for five minutes, wash it off, then you get the person who works there to scrub you with this glove. That gets all the dead skin and dirt off you. After you do that, they can stretch you out \u2014 it\u2019s different than a massage. Then, you go into the next room and wash yourself. And then you go into the third room, which is the cooler one, and relax for a few minutes. And then you go out to a little salon to recline for 10 to 20 minutes because the whole process can be overwhelming and really tire you out.\u201d\n\nA t t r a c t i o n s Jardin Majorelle.

It\u2019s the No. 1 tourist destination in Marrakech, but well worth the trip. The French painter Jacques Majorelle opened up his private garden to the public in 1947. Then in 1980, Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berg\u00e9 bought and restored it. It\u2019s a very beautiful, very big garden. Walk around there and then go to Caf\u00e9 Majorelle and the boutique, which has handmade Moroccan artisan goods, that are on the property. The Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent (Rue Yves Saint Laurent), which is right next door to the garden, is quite new and definitely worth checking out. It\u2019s only a few years old, done by two French architects, Karl Fournier and Olivier Marty. The museum has a permanent retrospective of Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s work as well as rotating exhibits on fashion, art, and design.\u201d\n\nD a y T r i p Kasbah Bab Ourika. Photo: Alan Keohane/Courtesy of Kasbah Bab Ourika \u201cI love going to Kasbah Bab Ourika (Ourika, Morocco) to rest. It has 26 rooms, which all have private terraces or pools and are decorated in warm earth tones. It\u2019s on a hilltop, and you can see the Ourika Valley and the Atlas Mountains. It\u2019s an hour drive from Marrakech. If you\u2019re there on a Monday, in the village below, there\u2019s a local market. You buy some vegetables and meat, and they\u2019ll cook it for you right there. Or the hotel restaurant serves dishes like charcoal-cooked beef tagine and spicy lentil fritters made with organic ingredients from its own garden and the local market. If you want to really relax, go here.\u201d", "description": "In Hassan Hajjaj\u2019s guide to Marrakech, Morocco, the photographer recommends emerging fashion boutiques, lamb burgers on a rooftop, and where to see contemporary African art.", "authors": ["Trupti Rami"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/urbanist/2019/10/marrakech/01-marrakech-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
