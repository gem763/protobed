True Hollywood Story, and there were some pretty wild revelations to come out of it.\n\nThe documentary, which is available on YouTube and airs on E! on Sunday, pumped out some incredible facts about the reality star.\n\nMum-of-four Kim, 38, opens up like never before as she talks about her life for the show, which also features interviews with family members, friends, and industry insiders.\n\n(Image: E!)\n\nHere are some of the wildest revelations to come out of it...\n\nKim once pretended to have dinner with Britney Spears\n\nIn her early days of fame, Kim figured out how to manipulate the paparazzi to increase her status in the celeb world.\n\nAnd when best pal Jonathan Cheban suggested they \"do something crazy\" to get some attention, she knew exactly what to do.\n\nJonathan says on the show: \"We were in New York, and Britney Spears was in this hotel, locked up in her room.\n\n\"We notice there's paparazzi outside.\"\n\nJonathan and Kim got int a Rolls Royce and pulled out outside so they'd be photographed heading into the hotel.\n\n(Image: E!)\n\n(Image: KimKardashian/snapchat)\n\nAnd after 10 minutes hiding in the lobby, it seems the plan worked.\n\nJonathan added: \"We literally go hide in the lobby in a phone booth, wait ten minutes, then come out. And the next day the story was 'Kim went to see Britney'.\"\n\nKim laughed: \"They said in the press that we were there to have dinner with Britney Spears - this whole thing didn't even happen.\"\n\nKim was mistaken for her dad's mistress during the OJ Simpson trial\n\nKim's later father, Robert Kardashian, famously worked on OJ's legal team during his trial for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nThe trial took place in 1994, when Kim was just 14-years-old.\n\nShe said it was the first thing that had truly divided their family, with Kim's mum Kris, a close friend of Nicole's, believing that OJ was guilty at the time.\n\nBut she said the weirdest thing about the trial was being mistaken for her dad's mistress.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nKim said one time she'd headed to her father's home was reported in the press as \"Robert Kardashian's mistress pulls up to his house\".\n\nShe said: \"I was like, this can't be real - they lie like this? I learned the lesson of, not everything is what you think it is.\"\n\nKim decided she wanted to be a reality star at age 12\n\nBelieve it or not, it was always Kim's dream to be a reality star.\n\nIt all started when she watched The Real World when she was just 12-years-old.\n\nKim's childhood friend Allison Statter said: \"The Real World launched in 1992 when Kim and I were 12-years-old.\n\n\"And Kim was mesmerized. She was like 'I have got to get on The Real World'.\"\n\nKim added: \"I said to her 'oh my god' this is what I want to do when I'm older. I want to be on a reality show.\"\n\n(Image: MEGA)\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\nAnd Kris said her pal Kathie Lee Gifford was dying to see the family on TV too.\n\nShe said: \"[She] would tell me constantly, 'You guys need a show, nobody would believe what goes on in your life'.\n\n\"This went on for a couple of years, until I met the casting director for Dancing With the Stars. She came over for dinner one night and was just watching all of this chaos. She goes, 'This is just crazy, I've got to introduce you to Ryan Seacrest'.\"\n\nParis Hilton taught Kim exactly how to get out of a car in front of the paparazzi\n\nLearning from the best, Kim had lessons in stepping out of cars from old pal Paris Hilton.\n\nKim and the hotel heiress have been friends since childhood, but of course, things between them have been strained at times.\n\nHowever, Paris did impart this special knowledge onto Kim, who said: \"I remember we were sitting in her SLR Mercedes... and at that point, the paparazzi would lay on the ground to try and get a picture of you, up your dress, and she said, 'OK. We need to make sure you don't give them that'.\n\n(Image: parishilton /Instagram)\n\n\"She was such a great mentor for me. I really am grateful for my experiences with her. She's a huge, huge reason for my success.\"\n\nA psychic predicted the Kardashians' worldwide fame\n\nAnother thing to come out in Kim's True Hollywood Story is that a psychic saw this all coming all along.\n\nShortly after the OJ trial, Robert visited a psychic, who told him exactly what was in store for his family.\n\nKim said: \"The psychic told him 'ya know, your last name Kardashian is going to be known worldwide. And it's not now, its not because of your OJ fame.\n\n(Image: Wireimage)\n\n\"And my dad was like 'yeah ok, this is exactly why I don't like psychics'.\"\n\nBut Kim said: \"Knowing what I know about fame now, would I give it up? The answer is honestly no. I think I was made for it.\"\n\n* E! True Hollywood Story: Who is Kim Kardashian West is available to watch now on Youtube and airs on E!
