The inquiry is currently being carried out by several committees. The White House counsel has also cited the lack of a full vote as a reason that the White House is not cooperating with the inquiry. A formal House vote is not a step that is required by the Constitution to begin an impeachment inquiry, although previous inquiries have started with such a vote.\n\nThe vote would force Democrats and Republicans to go on the record for their support, or lack thereof, for an impeachment inquiry.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cbsnews.Com News Nancy-Pelosi-Announcement-Watch-Live-Stream-As-Pelosi-Addresses-Press-Today-About-Trump-Impeachment-Inquiry-Live"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
