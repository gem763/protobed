Ms Kappick says her daughter has no communication or mobility, and that the current NDIS system is failing that section of the disabled community. Ms Kappick says she never receives a call back regarding her NDIS services, and that she has been battling to receive equipment for her daughter since 2017.\n\nOver the sound of her heart pounding in her chest, Bec can hear the sickening crunch of Jordyn\u2019s head connecting with the wall.\n\nThe Queensland mum-of-two throws her weight forward, desperately trying to restrain and calm her 12-year-old daughter.\n\nBec is effectively running a constant marathon \u2013 an ongoing battle of attrition warfare where she is the last line of defence.\n\nLike always, Jordyn violently fights back, her nails scratching up Bec\u2019s arms and her long limbs knocking bruises into her skin while her screams echo throughout the family home.\n\nOnce Bec used to be strong enough to hold her daughter back \u2013 but now, as she tells Kidspot, she can only try to distract Jordyn, to slow her down for long enough for the outburst to pass.\n\nOften this takes over an hour - with no guarantee that Jordyn won't have another outburst later. This is the life that Bec and her family have lived for as long as they can remember.\n\nWant to join the family?

Source: Madeline Cox\n\n\"She probably wouldn\u2019t ever catch up\"\n\nJordyn was only six months old when her developmental delays first became obvious.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t meeting milestones in the same way as other kids her age \u2013 and also seemed to struggle with her vision.\n\nSoon Jordyn had also been diagnosed with epilepsy and autism.\n\n\u201cWe were continually told that things would get easier,\u201d Bec says.\n\n\u201cBut we eventually realised that realistically she probably wouldn\u2019t ever catch up with other kids.\"\n\nJordyn's violent attacks often end in her getting seriously injured. Source: Madeline Cox\n\n\"It\u2019s just out of the blue\"\n\nThis difference only became more apparent after Jordyn was diagnosed with Syngap1 in 2015.\n\nThe rare disease, which only affects 470 people worldwide, is likely responsible for Jordyn\u2019s other disabilities, as well as her aggressive behavioural issues.\n\nIt's Jordyn\u2019s violent attacks on family, carers and even herself that have become harder to deal with as she gets older \u2013 especially in the last year.\n\n\u201cShe just melts down, headbutting things, lashing out, yelling and screaming,\u201d Bec explains.\n\n\u201cOften it\u2019s just out of the blue \u2013 but even if there is a certain trigger, we can\u2019t always prevent it.\n\n\u201cAll we can do is distract her and try to calm her down, although that doesn\u2019t always work. It\u2019s not just for Jordyn\u2019s safety \u2013 people are also at risk of getting hurt if she lashes out.\n\n\u201cIt's getting harder to stop her from doing this.\"\n\nBec often also suffers physical injuries from Jordyn. Source: Madeline Cox\n\n\"We can't find any services that are willing to cope with her\"\n\nIt\u2019s these outburst that also makes it harder for support workers and other services to help Jordyn.\n\nAlthough Bec and her family are desperately in need of help \u2013 their experiences with support services have so far ended up being more trouble than they are worth - and quite frankly they simply don't have the time or patience to deal with with the unbearable bureaucracy.\n\nFor a while, Jordyn was being collected from school by a support worker to give Bec a break - but each time it took the worker nearly two hours to calm Jordan down enough to be able to do anything.\n\n\u201cIt just ended up being more work,\u201d Bec says.\n\n\u201cJordyn gets pretty bad separation anxiety which makes it harder.\n\n\"For the past year, we haven\u2019t been able to find any services that are willing to cope with her behaviour.\u201d\n\nJordyn also breaks property when she lashes out. Source: Madeline Cox\n\n\"Why did it have to get to this point?\"\n\nEarlier this month, Bec reached breaking point, contacting both Child Safety and the NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) to see what options they had left for Jordyn.\n\nBec says she was told there was only one option left \u2013 for her and her husband to relinquish their parental rights.\n\nThey were told this was the only way that Jordyn could access the services and medical help that she so desperately needs.\n\nBut neither Bec, or her husband, want to give up their daughter \u2013 in fact, they are outraged that this extreme and ludicrous notion is all that can be offered.\n\n\u201cWhy did it have to get to this point before they will help us?\u201d Bec asks.\n\n\u201cThere are so many other families in the same situation \u2013 who feel like they are unable to continue fighting.\n\n\u201cRelinquishing your rights as a parent shouldn\u2019t be the only option.\u201d\n\nBec just wants to get Jordyn the help she so desperately needs. Source: Madeline Cox\n\n\"There isn't another option\"\n\nIn the end, the couple instead took Jordyn to emergency \u2013 hoping that by getting her admitted to hospital they could keep her safe for the time being.\n\nAlthough the staff seemed confused, as Jordyn isn\u2019t physically unwell, they did their best to sedate her.\n\nDuring the 12 days Jordyn spent in the hospital, countless social workers, support staff and agencies came together to work out what to do.\n\n\u201cThey all tried to come up with another option - but they couldn\u2019t come up with anything,\u201d Bec says.\n\n\u201cAll we can do is place Jordan in part-care while we try to find a permanent solution.\u201d\n\n\"I\u2019ve been struggling since Jordyn went into part-time care.\" Source: Madeline Cox\n\n\"We\u2019re desperate for help\"\n\nJordyn has now been living in a care facility three days a week for the past two weeks.\n\nBec is trying to find her a behavioural specialist in Brisbane would be willing to stage a week-long invention to help them.\n\nShe also wants to fly Jordyn to Melbourne to meet with Syngap1 neurologist Dr Ingrid Scheffer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep busy with it all,\u201d Bec says.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve been struggling since Jordyn went into part-time care. The past few months have been so difficult \u2013 and I\u2019m extremely drained.\n\n\u201cWe just want to be able to get Jordyn into the services she needs \u2013 we\u2019re desperate for help.\u201d\n\nDesperate to keep her safe - Jordyn spent 12 days in hospital.

The closest is five hours away.\"\n\nAn NDIA spokesperson confirmed that they are in contact with Jordyn's family.\n\n\"We are working with them to review Jordyn\u2019s plan to ensure she has the appropriate funding for her support needs, including increased respite services,\" the spokesperson tells Kidspot.\n\n\"Jordyn\u2019s new plan is expected to be finalised shortly.\"\n\nTo donate to Jordyn's treatment, visit her GoFundMe", "description": "\"We've tried everything but nobody can come up with another option.\"", "authors": ["Madeline Cox"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/330f4c8c6b97176868f10258149a1c72", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
