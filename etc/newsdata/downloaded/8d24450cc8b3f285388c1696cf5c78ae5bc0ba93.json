Trump lashed out, indiscriminately, in all directions. His unfocused rage was as cogent as a primal scream and as subtle as a column of Turkish tanks.\n\nAD\n\nHe attacked the media and the Democrats, of course, and James Comey, Andrew McCabe, James Clapper, John Brennan and \u201cthe two great lovers,\u201d Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. But he also attacked NATO members and the European Union. He attacked Germany, Spain and France. He attacked his guest (\u201cItaly is only paying 1.1 percent\u201d of gross domestic product for defense \u201cinstead of the mandated 2 percent\u201d). He attacked Google and Amazon. He attacked those seeking to rename Columbus Day. He floated a new conspiracy theory saying, \u201cI happen to think\u201d 2016 election corruption \u201cgoes right up to President Obama.\u201d\n\nSickeningly, he attacked just-abandoned Kurdish allies as if they deserve the massacre they are now receiving. He portrayed these friends as enemies, saying they\u2019re \u201cnot angels,\u201d that it\u2019s \u201cnatural for them\u201d to fight and that the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party is \u201cmore of a terrorist threat in many ways than ISIS.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump even attacked his fellow Republicans over Syria, unleashing particular fury on the GOP legislator who has compromised himself more than any other to appease Trump, Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.). Told that Graham had warned Trump\u2019s abandonment of northern Syria could be a \u201cdisaster,\u201d Trump snapped: \u201cI think Lindsey should focus on Judiciary.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nImplicitly threatening Graham, Trump continued: \u201cThe people of South Carolina don\u2019t want us to get into a war with Turkey, a NATO member, or with Syria. . . . The people of South Carolina want to see those troops come home. And I won an election based on that, and that\u2019s the way it is, whether it\u2019s good or bad.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Trump went on to a private meeting with congressional leaders in which he called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) a \u201cthird-grade politician\u201d and his former defense secretary Jim Mattis \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMore revealing was who Trump didn\u2019t attack: Turkey and Russia. He said Turkey\u2019s invasion \u201cdidn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d He praised Turkey for being \u201calmost paid up\u201d with NATO. He said Russia, Iran and Syria can be trusted to take over the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nSuch incoherent rage, combined with confusion distinguishing between friend and foe, is uniquely disconcerting coming from the most powerful man in the world. Trump once worried that \u201cthe world is laughing at us.\u201d Now the world is staring at us, mouth agape.\n\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella, likely briefed on a similar rant Trump gave while meeting with the Finnish president, listened without expression to Trump\u2019s expansive grievances and said, \u201cI\u2019m not here to judge what other countries do\u201d when asked about Trump\u2019s Syria pullout. Mattarella gently but firmly restated Italy\u2019s \u2014 and the democratic world\u2019s \u2014 position, all at odds with Trump\u2019s utterances: \u201cThe Turkish attack on Syria is a serious mistake.\u201d The invasion has \u201calready caused a number of casualties and tens of thousands of refugees and displaced people and there are plenty of victims amongst civilians.\u201d The attack risks \u201coffering new space . . . to ISIS and to its criminal terrorist activities.\u201d Mattarella also defended Italy\u2019s NATO contributions and the United Nations and counseled against a trade war.\n\nAD\n\nTrump, by way of rejoinder, boasted about new U.S. tariffs and said: \u201cWe cannot lose a war of tariffs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut that was mild compared with much of Trump\u2019s wandering fury. He trained it on Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.); on the \u201cmilitary industrial complex\u201d; on delinquent NATO members trade policy (\u201cthe United States is not being treated fairly\u201d); on Obama\u2019s military spending; on the E.U.\u2019s digital tax; on ABC News; and even on a disturbance in the back of the room (\u201cExcuse me? Is there a problem back there?\u201d).\n\nHis furor only increased each time he was confronted with reality. Asked earlier about Erdogan rejecting a cease-fire, Trump shot back: \u201cHe didn\u2019t say that at all.\u201d (Erdogan said: \u201cWe will never declare a cease-fire.\u201d) Trump then coldly washed his hands of the Syrian mess, saying: \u201cI wish them all a lot of luck.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThey\u2019re going to need it. So are we.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The president seems to be alone against the world.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-QbdJKSbrRDj2VF2iBoSHvruhhI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AR2SDEXQJQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
