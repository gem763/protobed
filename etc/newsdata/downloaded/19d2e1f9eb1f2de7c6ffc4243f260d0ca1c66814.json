A justification letter attached to the filing says that ICE will pay TRSS for customized dossiers of information and subscriptions to proprietary databases of real-time records of arrests and incarcerations.\n\nICE initiated the procurement process on Aug. 15, two days after Breitbart News published footage of activists protesting outside an ICE field office and menacing its personnel.\n\nThomson Reuters Special Services (TRSS) provides \u201cstrategic and tactical global risk insights\u201d to its clients. The agreement could be worth as much as $3,399,990 if extended from an initial one- year term to a full three years.\n\nICE\u2019s single source solicitation, not yet an awarded contract, states that TRSS is the only vendor that can provide ICE\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility with the proprietary data necessary \u201c to make immediate threat level determinations and actions associated with adverse information against ICE personnel.\u201d Within ICE, the Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR) is also the division tasked with internal investigations.\n\n\u201cThis service will provide diligent and proactive vulnerability assessments, subject matter expertise and continuous monitoring to ascertain possible threats targeted at the ICE Director, ICE Senior Officials and other designated ICE personnel and their respective family members who are the target of threats,\u201d the justification letter reads.\n\nICE awarded a shorter contract to monitor \u201cnewly emergent threats on as many as 100 ICE personnel\u201d to TRSS in 2017, switched to another provider in 2018, and is now pursuing a longer contract with TRSS.\n\nAs ICE\u2019s work has become the subject of intense criticism for its practice of separating migrant children from their families, its agents have faced escalating threats. The CEO of TRSS, Stephen Rubley, serves on the board of the ICE Foundation, a nonprofit organization that \u201csupports the men and women of ICE.\u201d\n\nReuters News Agency, also a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters, reports on ICE. Neither TRSS nor Reuters News responded to requests for comment, but a spokesperson told NBC News in June 2018 that the company\u2019s reporting was \u201ccompletely independent of any [of] our commercial relationships.\u201d ICE and DHS also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to a separate filing, the Department of Homeland Security awarded an almost $2 million contract to TRSS on Oct. 10. That contract will grant Customs and Border Protection access to a selection of Thomson Reuters data including \u201cReuters News, Social Media, Publications, Global Business Data, Patent Data, Public records and Adverse Filings and World-Check Risk Intelligence.\u201d\n\nThomson Reuters has come under fire for its work with ICE before. Last year, advocacy and watchdog group Privacy International wrote to Thomson Reuters asking that the company discontinue its work with ICE, which included a $6.7 million contract for real-time jail booking information and a $26 million one for a license plate database. The agency used both services to locate immigrants.\n\n\u2014Taylor Hatmaker contributed reporting", "description": "The contract to help ICE monitor \u201cpossible threats\u201d against the agency\u2019s officials could be worth as much as $3.4 million.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2616,w_4651,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570844227/GettyImages-452533460_vtywim", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
