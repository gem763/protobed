I seem to be blocked on Instagram.\u201d\u2018\n\nShe added: \u2018And she said no, it was probably one of the kids messing about with her phone that had done it. She was completely convincing.\u2019\n\nColeen has been dubbed \u2018WAGatha Christie\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHowever, sources claimed to The Mirror that Coleen \u2018knew\u2019 Rebekah was to blame for the stories making their way to The Sun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey added that she needed \u2018proof\u2019 and that simply blocking her wasn\u2019t going to \u2018cut the mustard\u2019.\n\nColeen sent the internet into meltdown earlier this week when she revealed she\u2019d been trying to suss out who had been selling stories on her.\n\nWhile she accused her former friend Rebekah, the 37-year-old denied all claims.\n\n\u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for,\u2019 she fired back in her own statement.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nFellow WAG Danielle Lloyd later waded into the row, claiming she has previously \u2018had run-ins with Rebekah before over similar things\u2019.\n\nAsked whether she believes Rebekah is responsible, Danielle replied on This Morning: \u2018It\u2019s definitely come from Becky\u2019s account so who was it?\n\n\u2018I think she did it. Sadly I really do. I think it\u2019s a shame because she probably never thought she was going to get caught out.\u2019\n\nAfter making the claims live on air, Rebekah has since denied Danielle\u2019s accusations they had \u2018similar run-ins\u2019 with a particularly scathing tweet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Danielle Lloyd making false claims on @thismorning that we have had \u201csimilar run-ins\u201d is utter boll**ks,\u2019 Rebekah wrote.\n\nSince, Becky has confirmed there is an \u2018investigation\u2019 into Coleen\u2019s claims, with it being reported that she\u2019s been \u2018forced\u2019 to take her kids out of school.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Coleen\u2019s reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
