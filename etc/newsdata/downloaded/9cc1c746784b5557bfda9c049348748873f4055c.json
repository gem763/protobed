Photo: HBO\n\nAll throughout Succession this season, we\u2019ve heard rumblings about the Pierce family and their mighty prestige media empire. Finally, in Sunday\u2019s episode, the Roys meet \u201cthose blue-blooded fucks\u201d face-to-face: matriarch Nan (Cherry Jones), her favorite niece Naomi (Annabelle Dexter-Jones), and a gaggle of Ph.D.-clad, Brookings Institute\u2013endorsed cousins. But \u201cTern Haven\u201d isn\u2019t so much a showdown as a show-off. The Roys are basically auditioning for the Pierces, hoping to fake enough \u201cmoral character\u201d to convince Nan & Co. to sell their 150-year-old family jewel.\n\nThe Pierces are snobby in a wholly different way from the Roys \u2014 they\u2019re old-money rich who quote Shakespeare instead of saying grace, and who toast with a family cocktail supposedly pilfered from the Roosevelts \u2014 but even this East Coast royalty ultimately wants a little more cash alongside their Pulitzer Prizes and Ivy League degrees. After the two families glad-hand over a cocktail hour, an agonizing dinner, and a late-night stargazing session, Nan grits her teeth and agrees to sell her gilded PGM empire. The Roy charade didn\u2019t exactly work, but Gerri\u2019s prediction still came true: The cousins wanted yacht money.\n\nLogan proves that money always wins in the end, but \u201cTern Haven\u201d still leaves the Roy kids feeling like losers. During dinner with the Pierces, Shiv blurts out that she\u2019s next in line to run Waystar Royco, leading Logan to nearly scuttle the PGM deal after Nan insists that they make the succession plan public. That one dinner is a meticulously plotted collision of the season\u2019s two biggest story lines. \u201cWe knew there would come a point where Logan tried to take things forward [with the Pierces]. We also knew there\u2019s gonna be an episode where the promise that he made to Shiv came to a boil,\u201d says Succession creator and showrunner Jesse Armstrong. \u201cWe knew in that episode that we wanted it to explode.\u201d\n\nFrom the start, the Pierces were written as a different kind of legacy-media family, just as powerful and monied as the Roys, but with maybe cleaner hands. \u201cThe Pierces are not based on any one family, but based on research into reputable, blue-blood, northeastern, legacy-media families like the Bancrofts, the Sulzbergers, the Graham family,\u201d says Will Tracy, the episode\u2019s writer. (A quick refresher on those media-mogul bloodlines: The Bancrofts sold The Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. in 2007, the Sulzbergers own the New York Times, and the Grahams sold the Washington Post to Jeff Bezos in 2013.) \u201cOne through line with those families was this idea that the media institutions they own are not so much for-profit companies, although of course they are. They like to think of them as almost a public good.\u201d\n\nThat idea is crucial to Logan\u2019s gamble: He wants to convince the Pierces that they aren\u2019t giving up their inherited empire, but merely allowing another (extremely) wealthy, (extremely) privileged family to shepherd it. From the moment the Roys exit their helicopter at the Pierce estate \u2014 grinning idiotically, Logan arm in arm with Marcia and Shiv \u2014 it\u2019s a twisted, paralyzing farce. \u201cWe thought it would be interesting to see a family like the Roys having to put on a different public face,\u201d Tracy says. \u201cTo show them wanting something, to show them having to pretend to be a happier-seeming family.\u201d\n\nDiscomfort immediately hangs above the cocktail-hour chitchat: Shiv makes a joke about Mark Pierce\u2019s umpteenth Ph.D., Maxim Pierce teases Connor about his long-shot presidential bid, and Naomi accuses Roman of trying to \u201corder her family\u2019s legacy over the phone like an Uber Eats.\u201d Succession\u2019s style often makes you feel like you\u2019re overhearing things you shouldn\u2019t \u2014 \u201cMaking you feel a bit like, Fuck, what if I was in there with the two powerful families?\u201d as Armstrong puts it \u2014 and Tracy structured \u201cTern Haven\u201d so those awkward skirmishes would reverberate throughout the episode. Logan looks around the cocktail hour, gritting his teeth as he sees all of his children fucking up. He calls his family together to privately stew in a bedroom where he\u2019s barking orders. It seems like the Roy-Pierce interactions can\u2019t get worse, but this is Succession, so of course they do.\n\nEverything comes to a head in the lengthy dinner-party sequence, shot over two days on location at a Long Island mansion. Pulling it off was no small feat: The show\u2019s production schedule demands quick shoots, which meant they couldn\u2019t film each part in separate chunks. Instead, episode director Mark Mylod and his camera operators relied on a loose, \u201cAltman-esque\u201d style to capture each moment as it happened around all the others. \u201cEverybody knows that the cameras around the table could be looking at them at any time,\u201d Mylod says. \u201cLiterally every single take, I\u2019ll be speaking with the camera operators and saying, \u2018Find me this moment.\u2019 But that won\u2019t be communicated to the actors. They just know that they\u2019re on at all times.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Mylod ratcheted up the tension even more by way of how his crew filmed: The camera operators got physically closer to the Pierces and the Roys as the dinner progressed, swapping out lenses to make the shift nearly imperceptible. \u201cHopefully, unconsciously, one would feel more intimately connected to the scene, but perhaps without ever realizing why,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a really, really slow version of the Jaws shot that tracks in on Brody. Hopefully, you get sucked into it so that ultimately you feel like you\u2019re at the table with them.\u201d\n\nThe script for the dinner scene didn\u2019t specify seating arrangements, so Mylod made table placements based on the dialogue and how he believed Nan would wield her role as host. \u201cNan would\u2019ve put herself at the back of the table, with her back to the fireplace. She has the power position. She\u2019ll have put Logan opposite her,\u201d he says. Adds Tracy: \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have clear doppelg\u00e4nger analogs. We didn\u2019t want each character in the Roy family to have their own bizarro version in the Pierce family.\u201d Instead, each pairing is designed to feed a mounting sense of friction: Logan lightly sparring with Nan and Holly Hunter\u2019s Rhea, Shiv floating awkwardly between Peter and Nan, Connor calling Maxim a \u201cdeep-state wonk with both lips firmly glued to the Soros teat,\u201d and just about everyone beating up on Tom.\n\nAn especially rich moment bubbles up when Peter and Marcie ask Roman if he\u2019s read any good novels recently. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s really a confrontational thing to do,\u201d Tracy explains. (Confrontational? Or absolutely demonic?) \u201cShe doesn\u2019t believe him, perhaps, but it\u2019s all done in a way that keeps up a veneer of amiability, which the Pierces are very good at. There\u2019s a lot of subtext in the way that they talk. They communicate in these pleasant ways that have a more cutting subtext underneath.\u201d Peter is politely chatting with Tabitha until he starts to pry, asking her if she\u2019d have kids with Roman; Naomi opens dinner with a Richard II passage that is definitely a pointed critique of the greedy Roys.\n\nPhoto: Callie Hersheway\n\nFor his part, Mylod relished the chance to make Roman \u201cwrithe and wriggle\u201d in an uncomfortable spot. \u201cIt was Kieran\u2019s own observation that that character, whatever room he walks into, just unconsciously he has to make it his own space. It\u2019s the equivalent of a tomcat pissing in the corners,\u201d Mylod says. \u201cWe get to see that character struggle in a room, when he is normally so at ease because he genuinely doesn\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d (The scene was initially even longer, Mylod adds, but had to be cut for time: Roman went outside and phoned a friend for help in the extended version.)\n\nMeanwhile, Kendall finds a frenemy in Naomi, another recovering addict who clocks him immediately. \u201cYou do sense that if they rattle off their life story to each other, there will be some points where the other person would definitely be vigorously nodding their head,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cWe wanted to show, as subtly as we could, that connective tissue that can exist between two people who are meeting for the very first time.\u201d\n\nThe fissure between Logan and Marcia that\u2019s been growing all season also rears its head at dinner, after Nan asks about her life and Marcia bristles at Logan batting the question aside. Mylod said they tried the moment a lot of different ways: \u201cThere was a bigger discussion over how alcohol-fueled that was. In some takes, it was stone-cold sober \u2014 a coldly bold fuck-you to Logan in his connection to Rhea and the increasing intimacy of that relationship,\u201d he says. But they ultimately went with a more \u201cwine-fueled\u201d take for the final edit: \u201cThat character is so disciplined socially, there would have to be something to open that door for her to really expose the tension between them.\u201d\n\nEventually, Nan\u2019s false folksiness drops and she gets down to brass tacks: Before the Pierces will even consider the offer, they need to know who\u2019s next in line for the Waystar throne. As Logan makes excuses, deliberately avoiding mention of his promise to Shiv, a look of frustrated panic flashes across Shiv\u2019s face and she blurts it out: \u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake, Dad, just tell them it\u2019s gonna be me.\u201d The oxygen is sucked from the room. How does such a crucial scene, especially one with such little dialogue, look on the page? \u201cWe did put a fair amount of effort into making it feel quite halting and hesitant and awkward,\u201d Tracy says. \u201c[The cast] played it so brilliantly that it does have that feel of realism. It\u2019s a tricky thing to do because you don\u2019t want anyone in the scene to behave stupidly.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Callie Hersheway\n\nPhoto: Callie Hersheway\n\nPhoto: Callie Hersheway\n\n\u201cOne of Shiv\u2019s main flaws is her impetuousness. It\u2019s her undoing in this episode,\u201d Mylod adds. To heighten the intimacy of the moment, the camera operators stood \u201cright behind the backs of the people at the table,\u201d catching every gutted reaction in the aftermath of Shiv\u2019s shocker. Everything that came before was just an awkward moment; now we\u2019re into it, seeing the season\u2019s biggest conflicts up close, with an extra layer of pressure added when all the Roys are in the same room, being watched so closely by the cameras and by each other.\n\nThe Shiv moment is the climax of the scene, and the room deflates into a stunned silence afterward. No one has gotten an answer they\u2019re satisfied with or convinced by. \u201cWe knew that was going to happen, but not because [Shiv] was a puppet or because we wanted to do that for our amusement,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cThe kind of person she was meant that eventually she would.\u201d", "description": "All throughout \u201cSuccession\u201d season two, we\u2019ve heard rumblings about the Pierce family and their mighty media empire.
