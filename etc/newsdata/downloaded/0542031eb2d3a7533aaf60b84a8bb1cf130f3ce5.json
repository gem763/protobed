At least 130 people were injured. Demonstrators in Barcelona on Wednesday set up blazing barricades, torched cars and launched projectiles at police.\n\nCatalan unions have called on a general strike in the region for Friday.", "description": "Quim Torra\u2019s allies say it\u2019s not the time to set \u2018deadline\u2019 for new referendum.", "authors": ["Emma Anderson", "Judith Mischke", "Diego Torres"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176342630-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
