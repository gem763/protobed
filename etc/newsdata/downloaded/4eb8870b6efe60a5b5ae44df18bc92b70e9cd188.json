REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Uniper (UN01.DE) said on Thursday its suitor, Finnish utility Fortum (FORTUM.HE), had yet to address a range of questions from the German energy firm\u2019s management to convince it to support a takeover deal.\n\nUniper said in a statement that Fortum needed to provide answers about its commitments to employees, Uniper\u2019s strategy and financial stability, as well as the composition of Uniper\u2019s supervisory board.\n\n\u201cUniper will continue to comprehensively assess Fortum\u00b4s intentions in the best interest of the company and all of its stakeholders, and is aiming to clarify these uncertainties during the ongoing discussions with Fortum,\u201d it said.\n\nFortum moved on Tuesday to gain control of more than 70.5% in Uniper by acquiring the shares of activist funds Elliott and Knight Vinke. That would add a stake of at least 20.5% to the 49.99% it already controls.\n\nHowever, the deal faces challenges. Russian regulators have so far capped Fortum\u2019s ownership in Uniper at 49.99% due to a strategic water licence operated by the German firm\u2019s local subsidiary Unipro (UPRO.MM).\n\nThe Finnish company needs the help of Uniper\u2019s management to try to address that issue.\n\nState-controlled Fortum has been seeking control of the energy firm since 2017, but Uniper\u2019s management had opposed a full takeover, warning it could result in a break-up and threaten the firm\u2019s credit rating.", "description": "Uniper said on Thursday its suitor, Finnish utility Fortum , had yet to address a range of questions from the German energy firm's management to convince it to support a takeover deal.", "authors": ["Ludwig Burger", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439316851&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991KL", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
