I wrote a lengthy explainer on the whole thing, and I\u2019m still learning about its nuances.\n\nStill, you\u2019d figure the president of the United States, with all his resources, could become better educated on the subject, since he is currently the target of a House impeachment inquiry. Apparently not:\n\n....This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u201cColluded\u201d with them, must all be immediately Impeached! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nTrouble is, impeachment (and the subsequent removal from office if someone impeached by the House is convicted by the Senate) is a constitutional remedy for abuse of power limited to members of the executive and judicial branches of office, as levied by Congress. It\u2019s not available for members of Congress themselves, as the Washington Post laconically noted:\n\nHouse and Senate members cannot be impeached; rather, both bodies can expel members with a two-thirds vote \u2014 a process that doesn\u2019t involve the president. That didn\u2019t stop Trump from also demanding on Saturday that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) be impeached.\n\nIn case you missed that dignified tweet, here it is:\n\nI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nLast time Morning Consult published its senatorial favorability ratios, Romney came in at 53/32. As of September 1, Trump\u2019s approval ratio in Utah was 47/50. This is a state Trump won by 19 points in 2016. I don\u2019t believe Romney is the one that the Great People of Utah are reconsidering.\n\nThe odds are reasonably good that Trump either knows you cannot impeach members of Congress and is deliberately misleading people about it, or doesn\u2019t know and doesn\u2019t care. The idea here is to throw the I-word back at his tormentors and doubters, and perhaps even get the MAGA folk wondering: Yeah, why aren\u2019t Pelosi and Schiff and Romney getting impeached? There\u2019s a definitive answer, but again, it\u2019s complicated.\n\nWe should definitely know from the experience of 2016 that Trump\u2019s invariable M.O. is to drag his critics and opponents down to his own level and then rev up his base to win a polarized contest in a discouraged electorate. So any accusations and actions launched against him will be hurled right back, however inappropriate or even unconstitutional. Some Democrats think Trump\u2019s habit of consorting with foreign leaders to mess with domestic political enemies is treasonous, and treason is a ground for impeachment explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. So of course he\u2019s going to accuse his accusers of exactly the same thing.", "description": "Trump is now demanding that his critics such as \u201ctraitors\u201d Pelosi and Schiff and even Mitt Romney be impeached, which is unconstitutional. It follows his M.O. of retaliating against critics and accusers by accusing them of his own sins.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/07/07-trump-impeachment-treason.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
