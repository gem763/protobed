Users see a photo of a potential match, and then choose to swipe right if they are interested in the person or left if they are not. If two users both swipe right on each other, indicating mutual interest, they are able to chat with each other in the app.\n\nThe study takes a look at how many potential matches actually expressed mutual interest, held a conversation, and exchanged some form of contact info (like a phone number) to allow for off-app communication. The authors defined the latter as an \"effective match,\" with the idea that a dating app like Hinge has done its job once two people start conversing elsewhere or meet in person.\n\nRead more: 7 relationship experts reveal the questions you should avoid asking at all costs on a first date\n\nIn an unsurprising result for anyone who has used a dating app of this format, the baseline rates for conversations and exchanging contact info are very low. The study found that 0.51% of all the potential 421 million matches between heterosexual men and women in the data sample actually led to a conversation, and just 0.12% exchanged off-app contact info.\n\nOf course, those low percentages still represent a large number of people connecting on the app. The study reported about 2.1 million conversations and 500,000 effective matches.\n\nThe main result of the study was that those effective match rates became quite a bit higher when users had various traits in common.\n\nEducation was one of those factors. The study compared users who said on their profiles that they attended a liberal arts college on the U.S. News and World Report's annual rankings to users who attended a ranked non-liberal-arts college or a school not on the U.S. News rankings. When both respondents attended a ranked liberal arts college, the likelihood of them having an effective match was 34.6% higher than when one user attended such a school and the other went to an unranked school.\n\nWhen two users both attended an Ivy League school, they were 64.3% more likely to match than if one attended an Ivy and the other didn't.\n\nThe study found that religion had a similarly large effect on match rates. Among users who listed a religious affiliation, effective matches were almost twice as likely between two users with the same affiliation than for mixed potential couples. The authors also noted that this effect was stronger among smaller religious groups in the sample, like Hindus and Muslims, than larger groups, like Christians and Jews.\n\nWhat type of connection users were looking for on the app also affected match rates. Users can select any combination of the three options \"casual,\" \"dating,\" or \"relationship\" in a field describing what kind of relationship they're looking for. As elsewhere, the study found that two people who chose the same options had higher match rates than pairs where one person chose an option and the other did not.\n\nSome more surprising similarities also helped with matching. Users with the same initials were slightly more likely than users with different initials to make an effective match. However, that difference was quite a bit smaller than some of the other attributes in the study.\n\nThe authors noted some limitations of the study. They pointed out that Hinge's user population is predominantly heterosexual, and results might not generalize to LGBT dating or other communities. They also note that the main measure of an \"effective match\" is based an a computer-automated search for exchanging off-app contact information, which could rule out other outcomes from a conversation.", "description": "Similarities in educational background, religion, and even initials can make a match more likely, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Andy Kiersz"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93c6072e22af42c73b7ce6?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
