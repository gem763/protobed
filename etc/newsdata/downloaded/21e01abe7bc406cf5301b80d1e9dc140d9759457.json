That blocks a key trade route that would better integrate Syria with its regional surroundings and help government-held Syria get on a more stable economic footing, which some in DC believe would diminish U.S. leverage to force a political resolution to the war.\u201d\n\nThe Tanf base represents a determination to retain a mostly symbolic military presence inside Syria if only to keep a small part of the country out of the Syrian government\u2019s control. Keeping U.S. forces there accomplishes nothing for U.S. security, it is flagrantly illegal, and it puts these soldiers at risk for no good reason. Iran hawks desperately cling to this base because it is their last foothold in Syria from which to pursue their obsession with Iran.\n\nIn the latest twist, Trump has touted maintaining a military presence in Syria for the sake of \u201ckeeping the oil\u201d:\n\nPresident Trump said that he is planning to keep a small number of troops in northeast Syria to protect the oil fields there and suggested that an American company might help the Syrian Kurds develop the oil for export. \u201cI always said if you\u2019re going in, keep the oil,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out with the Kurds so that they have some money, so that they have some cash flow. Maybe we\u2019ll get one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly.\u201d\n\nOne of the only consistent features of Trump\u2019s foreign policy views is his belief that other countries\u2019 natural resources should be ours to seize and exploit as we please. Trump\u2019s worldview is a bizarre mash-up of crude colonialism and racketeering in which allies are expected to pay protection money and open-ended military intervention is fine as long as it gets you paid. We have previously heard him express a desire to seize oil resources in Libya, Iraq, and Venezuela, and so it was inevitable that he would want to do the same thing with Syria.\n\nBesides the obvious practical difficulties of controlling Syria\u2019s oil fields with only a few hundred soldiers, there is the small matter of the sheer illegality of what Trump is proposing to do. Not only do our forces have no legal justification for being there and no authorization from Congress, but our government also has no right to sell this oil:\n\n\u201cOil, like it or not, is owned by the Syrian state,\u201d Mr. McGurk said Monday in an appearance at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank. \u201cMaybe there are new lawyers, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets.\u201d Mr. McGurk said that the only way to export the oil legally, the State Department concluded at the time, was to have an arrangement in which the money was put in escrow for use by the Syrians after the civil war was over, an arrangement that would have involved Russia and the Assad government.\n\nThat creates serious problems if there were an attempt to sell the oil from this area:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really possible for us to exploit those oil resources unless we want to be oil smugglers,\u201d McGurk said. He said that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a long-time oil industry executive, had looked into helping the SDF sell Syrian oil, but could not find a legal path for American involvement without Assad\u2019s permission.\n\nTrump\u2019s confused Syria policy is where his fascination with plunder and his obsession with Iran combine in a truly toxic mix:\n\nAccordingly, it\u2019s conspicuous that al-Tanf is what remains of the U.S. in Syria. \u201cIt is everything wrong with Trump\u2019s war in Syria,\u201d said [Aaron] Stein. \u201cThe fact that it will be the last American enclave in Syria is more evidence of how Iran myopia has poisoned U.S. objectives in the region.\u201d\n\nThere are U.S. troops that are still being kept in Syria for the worst and dumbest of reasons, and Trump is the one responsible for it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_348259271.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
