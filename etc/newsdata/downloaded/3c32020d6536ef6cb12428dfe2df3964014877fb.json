I think they saw that and gave me a start today.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t think that it was going to happen right away, being a big success and coming into a big club like this, it takes time. So I\u2019m happy with the progress I\u2019ve made so far and I\u2019m going to keep going from here.\n\n\u2018The team\u2019s been fantastic, they\u2019ve helped me so much, given me so much advice from the more experienced guys and the younger guys who are experiencing similar things so it\u2019s been a really good time for me.\u2019\n\nPulisic stole the show at Turf Moor (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nIt was a fantastic performance from the former Borussia Dortmund whose strikes with left foot, right foot and head completed a perfect hat-trick.\n\nLampard explained after the match why Pulisic has taken time to bed in, but now he is expecting big things from the forward.\n\n\u2018He went and played for his country in tournament football over the summer, when I got the job he had one week off and he said he wanted to come back,\u2019 said Lampard.\n\n\u2018I asked him if he wanted two weeks, but he wanted a week. I had to take that into consideration for him leg-wise and freshness-wise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He played some games early in the season, Callum [Hudson-Odoi]\u2019s come back, Willian\u2019s been playing fantastic, so I will have rotation issues. I\u2019ve just tried to get the best out of him.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s going to be a big player for us, a big, big player.\u2019\n\nMORE: Christian Pulisic becomes the youngest Chelsea player to score a hat-trick after Burnley demolition\n\nMORE: Frank Lampard explains why Christian Pulisic starts over Callum Hudson-Odoi for Chelsea against Burnley", "description": "Christian Pulisic has admitted that his start to life at Chelsea was 'definitely hard' but has seemingly put those struggles behind him by scoring a hat-trick at Burnley on Saturday...", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178351028_1572117299.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
