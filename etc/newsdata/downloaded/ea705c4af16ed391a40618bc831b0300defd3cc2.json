Cohen died a month later, aged 82. Seven months after his father\u2019s death, Cohen Jr began working on the material alone in a garage near his father\u2019s old house, later inviting other contributors to be part of the process.\n\nThose included Javier Mas, the Spanish la\u00fad player who formed part of Cohen\u2019s band for his last eight years of touring, and indie music stars including Beck, Bryce Dessner of the National, Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire, Damien Rice and Leslie Feist.\n\nThanks for the Dance will feature further contributions from composer Dustin O\u2019Halloran, producers Daniel Lanois and Patrick Watson, the Stargaze orchestra, Berlin-based choir Cantus Domus and the Shaar Hashomayim choir who performed on You Want It Darker. Former Cohen collaborators Jennifer Warnes and Michael Chaves will also appear.\n\n\u201cIn composing and arranging the music for his words we chose his most characteristic musical signatures, in this way keeping him with us,\u201d said Adam Cohen. \u201cWhat moves me most about the album is the startled response of those who have heard it. \u2018Leonard lives!\u2019 they say, one after the other.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s release has been trailed with a new song, The Goal, in which Cohen confronts his mortality: \u201cSettling at last / Accounts of the soul / This for the trash / That paid in full.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leonard Cohen: The Goal \u2013 stream\n\nIn an interview with the New Yorker published a month before his death, Cohen expressed doubt that he would be able to finish his unreleased song sketches.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get a second wind, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t dare attach myself to a spiritual strategy. I don\u2019t dare do that. I\u2019ve got some work to do. Take care of business. I am ready to die. I hope it\u2019s not too uncomfortable. That\u2019s about it for me.\u201d\n\nWas Leonard Cohen\u2019s Marianne the last artist\u2019s \u2018muse\u2019?

He told the Guardian that his father \u201cwas very interested in preserving the magic of his process and not demystifying it\u201d.
