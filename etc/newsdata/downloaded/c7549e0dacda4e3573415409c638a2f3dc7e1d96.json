I thought it was a joke, but it turns out, it\u2019s called the \u201cMobile Office Pack,\u201d and it was an actual factory option on late 1990s Fords in Australia.\n\nI\u2019ve been scouring the internet to learn as much as I can about the picture you see above, because the idea of a car company thinking there\u2019s a demand for a plastic table that shoves into a car\u2019s cupholders and sits on its transmission shifter amuses me to no end.\n\nAmong the first things I found in my search was an old article by now-MotorTrend-journalist Angus MacKenzie, who wrote in Wheels Magazine\u2019s October 1998 edition about the launch of Australia\u2019s then-new 1998 Ford Falcon, which represented the beginning of the \u201cAU\u201d series of Falcon and the end of the \u201cE-Series.\u201d\n\nAfter lauding the vehicle\u2019s lower seating position compared to its predecessor, its improved steering linearity, its hard-revving 4.0-litre inline-six engine, and its more comfortable ride, the reviewer mentioned the incredible plastic contraption with which I am now obsessed. From the story:\n\nFord is also offering an optional \u2018Mobile Office Pack\u2019 which includes a small table designed to fit over the automatic transmission holder and cupholder recess to form a stable working surface for your laptop computer or paperwork, a mobile phone holder in the centre armrest, extra 12 volt power outlet, and aimable front seat reading lamps.\n\nThe Mobile Office Pack \u2014 it\u2019s real! To further confirm this, I discovered in a September 4, 1998 issue of the Sydney Morning Herald multiple mentions of this wacky plastic desk.\n\nThe first, found in the margin of a story written by John Carey about what differentiates the AU Falcon from its predecessors, calls the table a \u201cMobile office kit\u201d and simply defines the marketing term as \u201ca plastic work table for laptop computers.\u201d The second reference, in Joshua Dowling\u2019s story about the AU Falcon\u2019s development and initial reception, discusses the device in further detail, pointing that it wasn\u2019t available on the luxury Falcon variants (called Fairmont). From the story:\n\nCuriously, Ford\u2019s cleverly designed office pack (a plastic table which doubles as a workbench for lap-top computers for repos on the run) is not available as an option on the Fairmont range\ufeff. Ford reckons mainly sales reps will use this accessory. For safety reasons, the table can only be fitted when the car is in \u201cpark\u201d.\n\n(Incidentally, the story, and also MacKenzie\u2019s writeup, both mention a mobile phone holder that folds into the centre console. That sounds, nifty, too.)\n\nConfusion over whether this table was actually a real option has littered the internet, with a member of Australia\u2019s Ford Forum creating a post with the title \u201cIs this a genuine Ford accessory?\u201d\n\nIn that thread is a response by one user claiming to have bought a Mobile Office Pack on the website for classifieds ads, Gumtree. Another user, a website moderator with the screen name \u201cRaptor,\u201d pasted into the thread something that reads a lot like an official Ford press release. It states that the option was only available on the base \u201cForte\u201d Falcon AU and the more optioned-up \u201cFutura.\u201d From Raptor:\n\nAU Falcon - Options and Accessories 3 September, 1998 An integral part of the AU Falcon program has been the development of a wide range of factory and dealer fitted options and accessories. The key advantage of factory or dealer fitted options is that customers avoid the risk of compromising the new car warranty, a risk which may arise with after market products. New Factory Fitted Options Mobile Office The Mobile Office Pack transforms the Falcon interior into an \u201coffice-on-wheels\u201d via the addition of several practical pieces of equipment. Available on Forte and Futura the Mobile Office Pack consists of: Horizontal Work Table - Designed to fit over the automatic transmission handle and cup holder recess to form a stable working surface for laptop computers, notepads, books and binders. The work surface also incorporates a beverage holder suitable for cans and most 600ml drink containers. To ensure the table is only used when the vehicle is stationary the work table can only be placed in position when the transmission lever is in the \u2018Park\u2019 position.\n\nMobile Phone Presenter - Designed to mount most brands of mobile phones the presenter provides a safe, secure and permanent phone mounting point. When not in use the mounting arm is concealed within the centre console.\n\nAdditional 12-Volt Power Outlet - This can be used for portable fax machines, laptops, etc. Stowage bag for worktable.\n\nAimable front seat reading lamps.\n\nRear reading lamps and grab handles.\ufeff\n\nImage: Nissan\n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure why I\u2019m so fascinated by this table. After all, the Falcon is not the only car to offer the driver a work surface on which to place a laptop (or in the case of the Ford, an old-school electronic organiser).\n\nThe Nissan NV200 shown above \u2014 and a number of other vehicles, really \u2014 offer a flat-folding passenger\u2019s seat to act as a table. And it makes perfect sense, especially for sales reps, as the Sydney Morning Herald pointed out.\n\nStill, compared to a flat-folding passenger\u2019s seat, Ford\u2019s execution was much more interesting. To use the Mobile Office Pack, you have to push the automatic shifter into park, empty your cupholders, grab the big piece of plastic from the trunk (or wherever you\u2019re storing it), shove the table into the cupholders and place it on top of the shift lever.\n\nIt\u2019s just so \u201cout there\u201d that I think it may actually be among the most ingenious automobile accessories I\u2019ve ever seen. Though maybe \u201cingenious\u201d isn\u2019t the right word.", "description": "I recently spotted on our \u201cThe Way Back\u201d Facebook page the photo above showing a table mounted inside a car\u2019s cupholder and on its automatic transmission shifter.
