The former vice president has not only consistently led Trump handily in just about every general election national poll, but Biden has also been leading Trump among the all-important persuadable independent voter as well as in many key swing states, including Wisconsin.\n\nAccording to online gambling site Bovada, Warren\u2019s odds to win the 2020 Democratic nomination hit \u201cminus money\u201d for the first time on October 7. When you consider Warren\u2019s middling standing just a few months ago, that\u2019s a heck of a surge to the front of the pack.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith a little less than four months until Iowa, there is still a lot of game left to be played. Even though Biden is slowly slipping in the polls and the rest of the Democratic field is fading away, Warren still has some glaring obstacles to overcome.\n\nChief among them are Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders seeks spark from Ocasio-Cortez at Queens rally On The Money: Supreme Court takes up challenge to CFPB | Warren's surge brings scrutiny to wealth tax | Senators eye curbs on Trump emergency powers Biden seeks to fundraise off fact he's running out of money MORE and the African-American Democratic primary voter.\n\nYes, Bernie \u2014 who many consider Warren\u2019s ideological twin \u2014 recently suffered a heart attack and has been on a downward spiral in the polls, but the fact that he raised more money than any other candidate in the third quarter of 2019 means he\u2019s going to stubbornly hang around for as long as he can. After all, Sanders did write \u201cthe damn bill\u201d when it comes to \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d and now he has scored the endorsements of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezHillicon Valley: GOP lawmakers offer election security measure | FTC Dem worries government is 'captured' by Big Tech | Lawmakers condemn Apple over Hong Kong censorship Sanders seeks spark from Ocasio-Cortez at Queens rally Biden endorsed by former Connecticut senator, 51 Massachusetts leaders MORE (D-N.Y.) and most of \u201cthe squad.\u201d\n\nWhile African-Americans comprise roughly 13 percent of the U.S. population, they are a far more powerful constituency within the Democratic party, representing 24 percent of the primary electorate. In South Carolina, \u201cblack voters are two-thirds of primary voters,\u201d and Warren is not faring well with these folks. The same scenario seems to be playing out in other southern early nominating contests as well. Further, Biden\u2019s support with black primary voters is currently greater than 40 percent. So unless Warren can find a way to pull African Americans her way or \u2014 at the very least \u2014 away from Biden, she could be in a long slog for the nomination.\n\nBut let\u2019s fast-forward and say Warren does indeed become the Democratic nominee, which is the most likely scenario at this stage. Conventional wisdom suggests Warren would be an easier out for Trump than other 2020 participants. I don\u2019t necessarily buy that. I see her as a sleeping juggernaut.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWarren intends to ride class envy and income inequality all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Her central argument is that capitalism isn\u2019t working for everyone \u2014 only the rich \u2014 and that she is the best person to refashion it so all Americans benefit. If her populist socialist call to arms gains traction outside of progressive circles, Warren could prove hard to beat in the general election.\n\nSo how does Trump secure reelection against Warren? With an aggressive education and persuasion campaign targeting Warren\u2019s credibility and her outrageous policy prescriptions.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign is sorely mistaken to think her Native American problem has dissipated. For decades, Warren has held out her alleged Cherokee ancestry in an effort to get ahead in her academic and legal careers which ultimately resulted in her landing a plum position at Harvard Law School; something that would be next to impossible to attain as merely a white graduate of Rutgers Law School, her alma mater. She even contributed recipes to a 1984 cookbook entitled Pow Wow Chow, edited by her cousin, which bear a remarkable word-for-word resemblance to recipes from a French chef and from \u201cBetter Homes and Gardens.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until a recent DNA test revealed her Native American heritage to be less than miniscule that Warren begrudgingly owned up to the truth.\n\nUndaunted by her past mistakes in fraudulently claiming victimhood status, Warren is once again rewriting her past. Now Warren says she was fired from a job in the 1970s for being pregnant in an effort to curry political favor on the 2020 campaign trail. Once again, the facts don\u2019t align with Warren\u2019s mythos.\n\nWhy does all of this matter? If Warren is willing to rig the system by out-and-out lying to solely enrich herself at seemingly every turn, one has to wonder who it is she is really fighting for. Chances are it isn\u2019t the little guy, the passed over worker, or the Mom-and-Pop business owner.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the policy front, Warren intends to onerously tax the wealthy and the corporations to pay for a government-run healthcare system, the job-killing Green New Deal and most student debt, among other items. Of course if you confiscated all of the money from the top one percent, you couldn\u2019t even foot the bill for Medicare for All without dragging the country into an even bigger debt crisis.\n\nFor Trump, getting bogged down in the minutia and absurdity of Warren\u2019s various plans would be a fool\u2019s errand. He is best served by framing her proposals as one big attack on economic freedom, a uniquely American principle, that will destroy main street and substantially hike taxes on the middle class and possibly even the lower class.\n\nIf the election does indeed come down to Trump vs. Warren, both parties should avoid getting overconfident. Not only will a Trump-Warren 2020 tilt be nastier than the 2016 election, it will likely be just as close.\n\nFord O'Connell served as director of rural outreach for John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign; he runs a political consulting business, is an adjunct professor at The George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management, and is a regular commentator on FOX Business.
