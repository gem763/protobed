No British prime minister has ever been impeached - only ministers - and the last attempted impeachment of a minister was in 1806\n\nJeremy Corbyn had been due to deliver his keynote speech at Labour's conference on Wednesday but will now address delegates later on Tuesday.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Tom Watson, who had been due to speak on Tuesday, said: \"This is a momentous day.\n\n\"It's right that Jeremy closes the conference this afternoon.
