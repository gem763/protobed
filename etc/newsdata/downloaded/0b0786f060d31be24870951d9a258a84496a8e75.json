From Jacquemus' teeny tiny bags that only hold a single AirPod, to handbags worn as necklaces and bracelets, designers have been pushing the limits of quirk. The latest comes from Off-White's Virgil Abloh, whose most covetable accessory from this September's SS20 season came in the form of a clutch that was more hole than it was bag.\n\nThe accessory, dubbed the 'Meteor' bag, is punctured with three giant holes, including one in the bottom corner. According to the brand, the bag, which can't actually carry any of your belongings, is intentionally 'unfunctional.' It's called 'fashion' Karen, look it up.\n\nDespite not actually acting as a vessel for your iPhone and lipgloss, it carries a $1,665 (\u00a31,353) price tag. Art is priceless, what can we say.\n\nPhoto credit: Pascal Le Segretain - Getty Images More\n\nThe collection was inspired by a meteor shower, hence the craters punctuating the bag's surface.\n\nPhoto credit: Pascal Le Segretain - Getty Images More\n\nFans of Off-White will notice that the new Meteor bag is simply a holy-er version of the brand's Jitney bag. Earlier this year, the Jitney bag inspired a smirk with its 'Cash Inside' instructions.\n\nThe meteor theme ran through the collection, with tank tops, wedge heeled boots and gloves all sporting big, circular cut-outs.\n\nPhoto credit: Alessandro Viero - Imaxtree More", "description": "You can't carry anything in it, but you can look like a luxury slice of Swiss cheese.", "authors": ["Lauren Alexis Fisher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9gc5Tf3BG.Qv0UZv2tLrRA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/1d525705f706ba86bdbcc0aee1ee94a8", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
