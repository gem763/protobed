Col. Alexander Vindman. According to the Washington Post\u2019s report on his opening statement, the Army nat-sec expert on Ukraine will tell Adam Schiff\u2019s House committee that Ambassador Gary Sondland was pushing a quid pro quo for aid just a couple of weeks before the Donald Trump-Volodymyr Zelensky call. The quid in this case was an investigation of Burisma and the Bidens, Vindman will testify, and not just a broader crackdown on corruption:\n\nAn Army officer assigned to the White House plans to tell House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that he was disturbed by President Trump\u2019s demand that Ukraine investigate one of his political rivals and feared it would undermine U.S. national security. Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, was part of a small group of White House officials assigned to listen in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His testimony returns repeatedly to his fears that Trump\u2019s manipulation of Ukraine policy to discredit his political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is unethical and damaging to U.S. national security. \u2026 \u201cIn the Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine,\u201d his statement reads. \u201cThis alternative narrative undermined U.S. efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine.\u201d Vindman cites a July 10 meeting in which Gordon Sondland, a major Trump donor and ambassador to the European Union, emphasized that to secure a meeting with Trump, the Ukrainians would have to \u201cdeliver investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,\u201d a Ukrainian natural gas company that had controversially tapped Biden\u2019s son to serve on its board. \u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the National Security Council was going to get involved with or push,\u201d his statements reads.\n\nVindman says he communicated his concerns to the NSC\u2019s attorney at that time, concerned that such a partisan play would split Congress on Ukraine aid. That would have \u201cundermine[d] US national security,\u201d Vindman explains in his statement. Fifteen days later, when he heard Trump bring up the Bidens in the call to Zelensky, Vindman says he became concerned that Sondland\u2019s quid pro quo was being put into place.\n\nThis lines up with Ukraine charges d\u2019affaires Bill Taylor\u2019s reported testimony and the texts between Taylor and Sondland. On September 1, Taylor asked Sondland if \u201csecurity assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Sondland replied, \u201cCall me,\u201d but a week later Taylor still suspected that the White House was leveraging aid for new probes into Burisma. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor texted on September 8, prompting a denial of any quid pro quo from Sondland, one which Sen. Ron Johnson later corroborated. However, Vindman\u2019s testimony now has Sondland pushing just that kind of quid pro quo before the call and before the hold on aid to Ukraine, which makes Taylor look more credible in his later suspicions.\n\nOf course, the problem here for Schiff et al is that Vindman never worked directly with Trump. He prepared a couple of memoranda for Trump\u2019s signature on Ukraine and aid, which Trump never signed, but Vindman has no direct testimony on anything Trump did except the Zelensky call. We already have the transcript of that conversation, so unless Vindman can contradict the transcript or discuss excluded comments, this won\u2019t directly get Schiff closer to impeachment. It might, however, impeach Sondland as a witness \u2014 and might be another reason why Sondland went back to review his testimony.\n\nThe Post notes that Vindman\u2019s family fled the Soviet Union when he was three years old, coming to the US, and that he claims no particular partisan affiliation. That background probably led him to focus his nat-sec research on Russia and Ukraine, which makes a lot of sense. For some reason, though, former Rep. Sean Duffy tried to argue this morning that it might have made him too close to Ukraine to be focused on US interests, which sounds awfully similar to the kind of criticism that people level against Jews regarding Israel. Be careful with this line of thinking, folks, before impugning the integrity of a military officer especially.", "description": "\"He has an affinity for the Ukraine\"?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/duffy-vindman.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
