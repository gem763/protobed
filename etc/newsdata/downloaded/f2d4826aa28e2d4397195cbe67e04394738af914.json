That\u2019s why we love this recipe from Abra Berens\u2019 cookbook Ruffage, which transforms the humble baked potato into so much more than a simple steakhouse side. Made from fridge and pantry staples, like canned tuna, baking potatoes, and whatever vegetable scraps are left in the crisper, the result is a hearty, slaw-topped masterpiece that looks impressive but is still simple enough to tackle at the end of a long day.\n\nJacket Potatoes w/ Shaved Vegetable Salad and Tuna Mayo\n\nBy Abra Berens\n\nBaked, or jacket, potatoes are truly one of my perfect vessels for any sort of topping. They turn the weird salads that I make for dinner into a complete and filling meal. Every time I tell someone that\u2019s what we are having for dinner, I can see them picturing the steakhouse (or cafeteria buffet) \u2014 soggy, slathered in sour cream and butter, with some lame-ass, dried-out chives on top. This is not that.\n\nThe key to a great baked potato is the textural difference between the jacket (skin) and the creamy, fluffy interior. For that reason, I like to use floury potatoes such as russets \u2014 potatoes that fall apart when boiled and are much better suited to baking \u2014 and then top them with anything that provides a good crunch; maybe something cold to contrast with the hot interior, and a surprising tang to balance out all that starch. If you are feeling portion conscious, bake them, cut them in half, and serve only one side per person.\n\nI love the richness that the tuna adds to the mayo, ensuring that you get a good amount of protein with your baked potato. I also love it because the mayo is salty enough to season both the potato and the vegetables in the salad. That said, I still sprinkle the potato with a pinch of salt before topping with the salad, because I like salt. If you aren\u2019t into tuna, feel free to omit and use plain or garlic mayo.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 large (280g) russet potato per person (the ingredients that follow are listed per potato)\n\n1 cup shaved vegetables, whatever is in season or in your refrigerator; I love red cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, radishes, kale, tomatoes, kohlrabi\u2026\n\n\u00bc cup Tuna Mayo (see recipe below)\n\nSalt\n\nHandful of parsley, cilantro, and/or chives, roughly chopped\n\nTuna Mayo:\n\n1 whole egg\n\n\u00bd tsp salt\n\n1 tbsp white wine vinegar\n\n1 150g can tuna in oil\n\n300 mL neutral oil\n\nPreparation\n\nHeat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Prick the potatoes all over with the tip of a knife. Place on the oven rack and bake until tender when poked with a knife (they generally will hold their shape), about 40 minutes.\n\nDress the veggies with the tuna mayo and a big pinch of salt.\n\nTaste and adjust as desired, return to the refrigerator (don\u2019t eat it all now, even though you could, or do as you like, and find another outlet for the potatoes).\n\nPull those hot potatoes from the oven and cut the length of the potato and 3 lines perpendicular to the center cut. Using potholders, squeeze the bottom of the potato, pushing the flesh up through the cuts (fluff with a fork if it doesn\u2019t lift up).\n\nSeason with a pinch of salt. Top with the vegetable salad. Sprinkle with the herbs and serve.\n\nTuna Mayo:\n\nIn a food processor, whiz the egg, salt, vinegar, and tuna until well blended. Slowly drizzle in the oil until the mixture is thick. If it is too thin, add more oil.\n\nWill keep in the refrigerator for up to one week.\n\nYield: Makes one potato\n\nExcerpted from Ruffage: A Practical Guide to Vegetables by Abra Berens.
