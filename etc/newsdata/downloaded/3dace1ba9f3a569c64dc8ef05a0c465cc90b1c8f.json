Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected sentiment to stay at 92 at the end of September.\n\n--The survey's measure of future expectations also rose to 83.4, up from 82.4 earlier in the month.\n\n--The slight increase in sentiment was attributed to favorable income trends and positive finances, which have held trade policy concerns in check, said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist. \"Despite the high levels of confidence, consumers have also expressed rising levels of economic uncertainty. Some of these concerns are rooted in partisanship, some due to conditions in the global economy (Brexit, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China), and some are tied to domestic economic policies,\" Mr. Curtin said.\n\nWrite to Likhitha Butchireddygari at likhitha.butchireddygari@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 10:25 ET (14:25 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
