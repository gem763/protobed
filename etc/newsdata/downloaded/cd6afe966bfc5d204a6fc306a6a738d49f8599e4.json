When you step on that stage, you're going to see it because they are really ready for it.\"\n\nStormzy's also close pals with Ed Sheeran, who he recently collaborated with on their smash hit Take Me Back To London.", "description": "Stormzy threatened to leave his record label over a high-up who wore black face at a party back in 2012", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20155761.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_TRNSMT-festival.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
