He is pictured in a video address from 2014\n\nIn 2014, he was a black-robed figure delivering a sermon from the pulpit of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri, his only known public appearance. He urged Muslims around the world to swear allegiance to the caliphate and obey him as its leader.\n\n'It is a burden to accept this responsibility to be in charge of you,' he said in the video.\n\n'I am not better than you or more virtuous than you. If you see me on the right path, help me.\n\n'If you see me on the wrong path, advise me and halt me. And obey me as far as I obey God.'\n\nThough at minimum a symbolic victory for Western counterterrorism efforts, his death would have unknown practical impact on possible future attacks.\n\nHe had been largely regarded as a symbolic figurehead of the global terror network, and was described as 'irrelevant for a long time' by a coalition spokesman in 2017.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq, and adopted his nom de guerre early on.\n\nBecause of anti-US militant activity, he was detained by US forces in Iraq and sent to Bucca prison in February 2004, according to IS-affiliated websites.\n\nHe was released 10 months later, after which he joined the al-Qaida branch in Iraq of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nHe later assumed control of the group, known at the time as the Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nAfter Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, al-Baghdadi set about pursuing a plan for a medieval-style Islamic State, or caliphate.\n\nHe merged a group known as the Nusra Front, which initially welcomed moderate Sunni rebels who were part of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad, with a new one known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Al-Qaida's central leadership refused to accept the takeover and broke with al-Baghdadi.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic caliphate, reportedly blew himself up during the targeted attack on his lair in Syria's Idlib province in the early hours of Sunday morning\n\nAl-Baghdadi's fighters captured a contiguous stretch of territory across Iraq and Syria, including key cities, and in June 2014, it announced its own state - or caliphate.\n\nAl-Baghdadi became the declared caliph of the newly renamed Islamic State group. Under his leadership, the group became known for macabre massacres and beheadings -often posted online on militant websites - and a strict adherence to an extreme interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nOver the years, he has been reported multiple times to have been killed, but none has been confirmed.\n\nIn 2017, Russian officials said there was a 'high probability' he had been killed in a Russian airstrike on the outskirts of Raqqa, but US officials later said they believed he was still alive.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic caliphate, reportedly blew himself up during the targeted attack on his lair in Syria's Idlib province in the early hours of Sunday morning.\n\nTrump tweeted without explanation on Saturday, 'Something very big has just happened!'\n\nHe arrived at area of the raid 48 hours beforehand, Turkish official said.\n\nThe ISIS leader was with his two wives, who were both reportedly wearing explosive devices, as well as his children which are believed to still be alive.\n\nThe video is as yet unconfirmed and the final confirmation of Baghdadi's death is underway while DNA and biometric testing is conducted, sources told CNN.\n\nKurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Sunday they had worked with the US on a 'successful' operation against Islamic State.\n\n'Our strong and effective operations once again confirm our strength and determination to go after (Islamic State),' the head of the SDF's media office said.\n\nOfficials say confirmation that the ISIS chief was killed in the explosion is pending, with President Trump is set to make a 'major statement' at the White House at 1pm (GMT).", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has led IS for the last five years, presiding over its ascendancy as it cultivated a reputation for beheadings and other gruesome killings.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/12/20242646-0-image-a-94_1572178153536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
