(AP) - The University of Nebraska has hired its former president as a consultant for $250,000 a year to help raise money to build a new $155 million football and operations complex.\n\nThe Omaha World-Herald reports that Hank Bounds will be paid with money from private donors for up to three years to help with the fundraising effort.\n\nBoard of Regents Chairman Tim Clare says Bounds already knows the project and has great relationships across the state.\n\nClare says he doesn\u2019t expect the consulting arrangement to affect the search for Bounds\u2019 replacement.\n\nState Sen. Mike Groene of North Platte says the consulting job is an odd arrangement that wouldn\u2019t happen in private business.\n\nBounds left the University of Nebraska\u2019s top job in August. He is currently a professor at the University of South Alabama earning $110,000 a year.\n\nBounds\u2019 base annual salary at NU was $510,400 when he was president.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The University of Nebraska has hired its former president as a consultant for $250,000 a year to help raise money to build a new $155 million football and operations complex.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
