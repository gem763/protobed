I love what I do and have much to contribute, but the comments are starting to wear on me.\n\nAs an example, at a recent conference when I was about to make a presentation, a younger colleague twice made reference to the fact that I had my notes on 5 x 7 rather than 3 x 5 note cards, saying, \"Guess that's what you gotta do when you get old.\"\n\nThis individual thought she was being funny and wanted to make sure everyone heard the \"joke.\" I said nothing, but it pushed all my self-doubt buttons, and I gave a substandard presentation.\n\nI understand I could simply ignore such comments. But what I'd love is a simple, honest, thoughtful response \u2014 not snarky or confrontational, because I don't think that would stop future comments, but a way to educate the colleague on how inappropriate and harmful these \"jokes\" are.\n\nKarla: It\u2019s always fun to fantasize about breezy comebacks (\u201cWell, kiddo, I\u2019d be happy to hand over my cards and let you present, but my notes are all in cursive\u201d). But if you\u2019re looking to make a point, you have several options of varying sharpness.\n\nBenefit of the doubt: \u201cI\u2019m sure you were just trying to make a joke, but that just came off as mean.\u201d With a co-worker, you could add: \u201cIt also undermines me and, by extension, the employer we\u2019re representing.\u201d\n\nFeigned bafflement: \u201cWhy would you say such a thing?\u201d\n\nAnyone who is capable of shame and truly means no harm will apologize on the spot. But you\u2019re talking about someone who used her bizarrely specific eye for detail to draw attention to what she saw as a sign of weakness. This is not the behavior of a well-meaning professional secure in her own competence.\n\nIn cases like that, go for blunt: \u201cPlease stop making those comments. They\u2019re rude, they\u2019re not funny, and they\u2019re ageist.\u201d\n\nAnd assuming you are at least 40, you could add: \u201cAnd you should know my age is a protected status under federal law.\u201d\n\nPeople who wouldn\u2019t dream of making snide remarks about someone\u2019s race, sex or religion for fear of being sued may not realize that the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) also prohibits discrimination against workers age 40 and older.\n\nLaurie McCann, a senior attorney with the AARP Foundation, says general awareness about age discrimination may be lacking because \u201cfew employers . . . include age as a component\u201d when providing diversity and anti-discrimination training, focusing instead on more familiar protected classes such as gender, race and religion. Even in litigation, says McCann, \u201ccourts tend to treat age comments differently than comments on gender and race.\u201d\n\nOf course, you can ignore such comments. But as with racism, sexism and other -isms, it\u2019s harder to ignore the disrespect behind them \u2014 or the very real bias older workers face. In a recent AARP national survey of adults older than age 45, 61 percent said they have either seen or experienced age discrimination. Nine in 10 of those said they believe it is somewhat to extremely common.\n\nWhether you say anything in the moment, document the incident afterward: what was said, when, by whom, and any witnesses who may have overheard. One stray remark is probably not something you can act on, but a documented pattern might be.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have access to the offenders\u2019 managers, many event organizers have rules of conduct prohibiting attendees from demeaning or harassing others.\n\nPro tip: Learn more about your rights and responses to age discrimination through the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.", "description": "Age discrimination is illegal in the workplace, and the older employee has several strategic options for responding to such disrespectful comments.", "authors": ["Karla L.
