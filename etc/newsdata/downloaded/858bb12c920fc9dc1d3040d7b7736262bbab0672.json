If this is not possible, we will have to leave with no deal.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\n\"In the event of no deal, the Government will prioritise the flow of goods at the border while continuing to take a risk-based approach to controls and checks on goods to minimise additional friction.\"\n\nHe added: \"We will continue to work to make sure we have the best possible preparation to support the flow of goods.\"\n\nMr Edwards said: \"This is the farcical level we have descended to - the British Government can no longer even guarantee we have the necessary supplies of toilet paper in a crash-out Brexit .\n\n\"It's already said it's willing to flush the economy down the toilet, but now we won't have the paper to clean up after.\n\n\"As much as this revelation lends itself to toilet humour, it shows the serious damage a no-deal Brexit would do, even to our most basic of supplies.\"", "description": "A major company said it was developing \"robust contingency plans\" across its supply chain to cope with no deal, but warned that stocks were \"not unlimited\".", "authors": ["Josie Clarke", "Richard Wheeler", "Oliver Milne", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images Eyeem"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19927637.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Man-holding-toilet-paper-roll-in-bathroom.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
