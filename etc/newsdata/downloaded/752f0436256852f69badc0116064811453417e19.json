The former judge was recalled from the bench in June 2018 after sentencing Turner, a former Stanford University student, to a mere six months in jail on three felony sexual assault charges.\n\nZlotziver said the district will begin the search for a new junior varsity girls tennis coach immediately.\n\n\u201cPlease know that we are deeply committed to maintaining an effective, safe, and positive environment for all students,\u201d she added.\n\nTurner was arrested in 2015 for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster during a fraternity party at Stanford. The woman, known as \u201cEmily Doe\u201d throughout the trial, has since revealed her real name: Chanel Miller. Turner faced up to 14 years in prison for the crime but was released after serving three months.\n\n\u201cA prison sentence would have a severe impact on him. I think he will not be a danger to others,\u201d Persky infamously said during Turner\u2019s sentencing. He also said part of his reasoning for a lenient sentence was due to \u201cmitigating\u201d factors like the role alcohol played in the assault.\n\nThe news of Persky\u2019s coaching position went public late Monday night, and a petition to remove Persky from the role was created shortly afterward. As of Wednesday night, the petition had over 3,000 signatures.", "description": "Aaron Persky, the judge who infamously sentenced Turner to six months for sexual assault, recently lost his new job at Lynbrook High in California.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d79818723000010055164b6.jpeg?cache=wzcybf7gia&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
