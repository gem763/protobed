For example, we could do adaptive reuse of the old bungalows and buildings owned by the UM for micro housing as the immediate concerns are to provide more accommodations for the students.\n\n\u201cIn the future, we are also looking whether to upgrade the old residential college or build a new one.\n\n\u201cWe will come out with a masterplan for it soon,\u201d he told reporters at the UM\u2019s chancellery hall after PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s speech here last night.\n\nFahmi also handed over RM 270,000 from the \u201cMesra Rakyat Programme\u201d to help with immediate student accommodation problems at the university.\n\n\u201cUM will upgrade six bungalows in Jalan 16, nearby the Zaaba 9th Residential College, to provide 144 accommodations to the students,\u201d he said.\n\nAnwar presented the mock cheque to UM vice chancellor Datuk Abdul Rahim Hashim after his two-hour talk on poverty.\n\nHe also took questions from the attending students and appeared jovial throughout.\n\nAnwar, who graduated from UM in 1971, regaled them about his prison days, his dream to help Malaysian people as well as taking a trip down memory lane when he had been a student there.\n\n\u201cI was a handful then. People always told me that I spent 30 minutes at the Library but two hours at the Speaker\u2019s Corner,\u201d he said when reminiscing of his student activist days when he had been president of the UM Malay Language Society and National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students.\n\nRelated Articles MOE will not intervene in UM protest grad issue Musa persoal graduan biadap tuntut UM tarik laporan polis Lepas ambil ijazah, graduan desak UM tarik balik laporan polis", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR Oct 25 \u2014 Lembah Pantai MP Fahmi Fadzil said he is working with Universiti Malaya (UM) and the Malaysia Architect Association (PAM) to develop plans on micro housing for the institution...", "authors": ["Radzi Razak"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bbozIMvin3xQImHqTj3aYg--~B/aD02Njc7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/0b6aaec406c4252c8b6ccb2f6b53aa1f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
