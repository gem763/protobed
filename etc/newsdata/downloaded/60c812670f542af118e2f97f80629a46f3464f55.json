Sebastian Scheiner/Pool via REUTERS *** Local Caption ***\n\nPompeo and Netanyahu met in Jerusalem hours after Turkey agreed with the United States to pause its offensive on Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nTurkey launched its assault against the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria last week after President Donald Trump pulled a U.S. contingent out of the way, creating a new front in Syria\u2019s eight-year war and prompting 200,000 civilians to take flight.\n\nIsrael sees Syria\u2019s Kurds, once U.S. allies, as a counterweight to Islamist insurgents in northern Syria. It also worries that its arch-foe Iran or local allies could fill the vacuum left by a disengaged United States.\n\nThe Kurds responded to the U.S. withdrawal by inviting Syrian government forces, backed by Moscow and Tehran, into towns and cities in areas they control.\n\nPompeo said he and Netanyahu discussed \u201call the efforts we\u2019ve made to push back against the threat not only to Israel but to the region and the world from the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shared our ideas about how we can ensure Middle East stability together, and how we would further our efforts to jointly combat all the challenges that the world confronts here in the Middle East,\u201d Pompeo told reporters with Netanyahu by his side.\n\nAsked for his reaction to the pause in Turkey\u2019s offensive, Netanyahu said: \u201cWe hope things will turn out for the best.\u201d\n\nLater on Friday, Pompeo will fly to Brussels for a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nISRAELI CONCERNS\n\nThursday\u2019s pause, brokered in Ankara by a U.S. team including Pompeo and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, gives Kurdish forces five days to withdraw from a \u201csafe zone\u201d Ankara had sought to capture.\n\nPompeo\u2019s visit on the heels of the ceasefire was widely seen in Israel as an attempt to assuage Israeli concerns that a U.S. force drawdown could expose it to attacks by Iran or its proxies.\n\nOfficials close to Netanyahu are quick to talk up the Republican president\u2019s unprecedentedly pro-Israel policies, such as quitting the Iran nuclear deal and recognising Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and the Golan Heights as Israeli-annexed.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s Syria about-face was the latest in recent steps that have stirred discomfort within Netanyahu\u2019s conservative cabinet, which had previously seen itself and the Trump administration as marching in lock-step.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s recent diplomatic outreach to Tehran and firing of hawkish National Security Adviser John Bolton have cast a cloud over Netanyahu, who highlighted in two inconclusive Israeli elections this year what he described as his close relationship with Trump.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nAmos Harel, military correspondent for the left-wing Haaretz daily, said the muted U.S. reaction to the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities and abrupt end in support to Syria\u2019s Kurds \u201cforces Israel to rethink its Middle East strategy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe American withdrawal raises questions about the extent of Trump\u2019s commitment to Israel when push comes to shove,\u201d he wrote on Thursday.\n\nThe conservative Netanyahu faces a Wednesday deadline to form a government following a deadlocked Sept. 17 contest with his main opponent, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo underscored U.S.-Israeli efforts to counter Iran in talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, in an apparent attempt to ease concerns in Israel that Tehran could exploit a U.S. military pullback in Syria.", "authors": ["Rami Ayyub", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442253582&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0XW", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
