And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nWhile negative interest rates may sound like a good idea, some money experts say there is a dark side to the policy, which has produced mixed results elsewhere. The combination of European banks\u2019 reluctance to cut their deposit rates below zero and a flat yield curve has been squeezing their profits.\n\n\u201cAs a highly leveraged property developer, Trump is thinking about negative rates from the perspective of a borrower, but the Fed\u2019s lukewarm appetite for negative rates is partly because officials know that it could cause outage among savers and drag the central bank into a political maelstrom,\u201d wrote Capital Economics Chief U.S. Economist Paul Ashworth in a Wednesday note to clients.\n\nOffice of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro backed up Trump's view Thursday that the Fed needs to at least match what's going on in Europe.\n\n\"This is a chess match,\" he told \"Mornings with Maria.\" \"Fed's playing checkers in a chess world. You've gotta look at what the Europeans just did, you've gotta match that and raise it.\"\n\nHIs comments came a day after Trump called the Fed \"boneheads\" for not taking advantage of \"a once in a lifetime opportunity\" to lock in rates at ultra low levels.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he wasn\u2019t thrilled about the prospects of negative rates when discussing the idea Tuesday at a conference in New York. He said he thought rates this year would be \u201cheading up not down\u201d and that his bank has begun \u201cthinking about how to be prepared\u201d for negative rates should the Fed head in that direction.\n\n\u201cObviously, you\u2019ve got to worry about the long-term effect of those interest rates,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard. There are businesses it doesn\u2019t affect at all. And there are businesses where it just sucks into your margin and there\u2019s very little you can do about it.\u201d\n\nThe idea of cutting rates below zero also doesn\u2019t sit well with former Dallas Fed adviser Danielle DiMartino Booth.\n\n\u201cOur banking system has created credit to help grow American businesses, to help American families buy homes,\u201d former Dallas Fed adviser DiMartino Booth told \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d on Thursday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cAnd if you were to have the banking system waylaid by negative interest rates they would not be able to lend as they do today. In President Trump\u2019s words \u2018we are a nation of debt,\u2019 and if you impose negative interest rates in this country you will bring the economy that is built on debt and that greases the skids of this economy to a standstill. It is the worst, most un-American idea I\u2019ve ever heard,\" she said.", "description": "President Trump wants negative rates in the U.S. What would that look like?", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/jerome-powell-ap2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
