So money is scattered around \u2013 to garner votes for the new Brexit party from a range of constituencies: veterans, teachers, policemen, to name but a few. But in a welcome deviation from Osborne\u2019s decade-long austerity, Sajid Javid offers the promise of a new \u201cfiscal framework\u201d and more investment on infrastructure. The latter must be welcomed. UK business investment as a 17 per cent share of GDP has for too long lagged behind the OECD average of 22 per cent \u2013 and explains the absence of a full recovery 12 years after the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nBut there is also denial. The \u201cdecade of recovery\u201d line after nearly 10 years of austerity was misleading. If this is \u201crecovery\u201d then why has Britain lagged behind her OECD partners, and why in the second quarter of this year did the economy shrink by 0.2 per cent \u2013 the worst quarter since 2012? The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) believes there is a 25 per cent chance Britain is already in \u201ctechnical recession\u201d.\n\nAnd \u201crenewal\u201d is an optimistic approach when a no-deal Brexit is piled on to economic weakness and a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d. The OECD estimates that the projected hit to living standards would amount in effect to a permanent \u201cBrexit tax\u201d on households. The NIESR estimate no deal is likely to take at least \u00a340-\u00a350bn (2-3 per cent of GDP) out of Britain\u2019s roughly \u00a32.5 trillion annual income (GDP). The IMF thinks it\u2019s likely to be worse, with a shrinkage of about \u00a365bn (3.5 per cent of GDP). And Philip Hammond warned the nation that the costs of mitigating a disorderly no deal could rise to up to \u00a390bn.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He\u2019s heavily restricted. He\u2019s been bullied by apparatchiks in No 10, and now economists and Treasury officials are ganging up on him. They\u2019ve got him cornered and wagging fingers are threatening him with the \u201chonour code\u201d \u2013 the \u201cfiscal rule\u201d. The nation\u2019s \u201ceconomic credibility\u201d, threatens the Resolution Foundation, depends entirely on the government\u2019s annual borrowing remaining below 2 per cent of GDP. If he breaks the code, they warn, he\u2019s done for.\n\nNever mind that \u201cthis is just a number plucked from the air\u201d as Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies told the BBC Today programme this morning. Never mind the risks the nation is facing: the risk and prolonged costs of no deal; the risk of a global recession. Above all, the terrifying risk of climate and earth systems breakdown and the threat that it poses to the security of an island nation, and to its economy.\n\nNo, argue the bullies. Nothing matters more than the chancellor honouring the code: bowing to a fiscal rule \u201cplucked out of the air\u201d.\n\nBut as we know from the bitter experience of the Osborne and Hammond years, you can\u2019t eliminate the government\u2019s deficit by cutting the nation\u2019s income. You can only do it by expanding investment, raising wages and generating more income for the Treasury via tax revenues.\n\nThe chancellor today made a valiant effort to raise the nation\u2019s income, by allowing the government to spend more, and putting more income into private sector pockets.\n\nBy doing so, he is challenging Treasury orthodoxy and improved his government\u2019s chances of winning the upcoming election.
