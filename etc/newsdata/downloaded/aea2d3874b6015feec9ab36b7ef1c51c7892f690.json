The way VAT works would also reduce the tax take. Labour\u2019s numbers simply don\u2019t add up.\n\nTim Baines, Rhiannon Cutler, directors, Baines Cutler Solutions\n\nNorth Somerset\n\nThe cost of old age\n\nWhen a new medical advance is announced, one that will prolong our lives, please will journalists ask about the consequences to future costs.\n\nIf one person lives one year longer than they would have lived, what is the typical cost to the country\u2019s other inhabitants? One year\u2019s pension plus one year\u2019s NHS costs? Perhaps \u00a310,000. This means we have to choose how we fund this extra cost. We do not address this issue. It is so politically sensitive that no politician will address it.\n\nIf the matter was brought to the fore by interviewers and journalists, the subject could then become a routine question and common thought in people\u2019s minds and we might then start to weigh up the real implications of increasing lifespans.\n\nWe cannot fund this by increasing the pension age because humans wear out, and we cannot keep working longer. Do we fund it by increasing tax on the whole population? Older people only? Increasing tax on the younger population?\n\nJennifer Walley\u200b\n\nAddress supplied\n\nWho is biased?\n\nMy MP Kwasi Kwarteng should not be allowed to get away with his suggestion, without apparently citing evidence, that \u201cmany people\u201d think British judges are biased.\n\nAt any time this would be a highly irresponsible statement to make. In the current fraught political context his comments are outrageous. The man needs to be brought to book by whatever means are available.\n\nAndrew McLuskey\u200b\n\nAshford\n\nDon\u2019t kill the badgers\n\nThere are no words that I can find to express my feelings of utter horror at the intended further slaughter of an estimated 63,000 badgers. This cull is being masqueraded as an attempt to control bovine TB. Anyone who has worked for decades, as I have, to protect our native wildlife from the hatred of a small but lethal section of our rural population knows this for the utter sham it is.\n\nThe Labour Party is committed to halting the badger cull. They are also committed to strengthening the hunting ban. I can only hope and pray that the many thousands who care about such things can look past the bloated Brexit pantomime for long enough to take in these facts, and consider them seriously when they vote in the next General Election.\n\nPenny Little\n\nGreat Haseley\u200b, Oxfordshire", "description": "Have our country\u2019s stalwart reporters gone collectively gaga?
