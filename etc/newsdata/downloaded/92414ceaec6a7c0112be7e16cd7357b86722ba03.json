But the more lasting and undeniably effective policy has been ushering in the era of \u201ccommunication-as-a-policy-tool.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade, there have been 83 FOMC meetings, with the interest-rate decisions and market-implied pricing playing out in the following way:\n\nIn 72 meetings, the market was anticipating no interest rate change and the Fed left rates unchanged.\n\nIn 9 meetings, the market was expecting a 25bps hike and the Fed delivered a 25bps hike.\n\nIn 2 meetings (July and September), the market was expecting a 25bps cut and the Fed delivered a 25bps cut.\n\nIn other words, the Fed hasn\u2019t gone against the market\u2019s pre-meeting \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d \u2013 even once in the past decade. With traders a 96% chance of a 25bps rate cut Wednesday, the FOMC will almost certainly 25bps and run the streak to 84 consecutive meetings.\n\nThe FOMC Landscape\n\nSource: FOREX.com\n\nEven though the immediate interest-rate decision is \u201cknown\u201d in advance, changes to the central bank\u2019s and the tone of Chairman Powell\u2019s could still lead to a volatile market reaction based on how they impact the implied odds of a rate cut in December. As of writing, Investing.com's rate-watch tool is showing about 15% odds of another interest-rate reduction in six weeks\u2019 time.\n\nIn terms of specifics, traders will key in on the committee\u2019s characterization of international trade in the wake of progress between the U.S. and China on trade, as well as any comments about the recently slowing growth in job creation. In addition, the central bank\u2019s decision last month featured three dissents (Bullard in favor of a 50bps cut and George/Rosengren in favor of leaving rates steady). Any further \u201cdissension in the ranks\u201d would introduce an element of uncertainty to the future outlook for policy.\n\nIn Powell\u2019s testimony, the key topic to watch will be the Fed\u2019s recent (re)introduction of asset purchases (which the central bank has definitively characterized as \u201cNOT Quantitative Easing\u201d). After the recent turmoil in the short-term funding market, traders will be keen for an update on the stability of this critical function of the financial system. If Powell indicates the program could expand from here or expresses pessimism about any other aspect of the economy, the could retrace last week\u2019s gains and stock indices could surge further into record territory on the potential for further monetary support into the end of the year.\n\nWhile its unlikely to be the most market-moving central bank meeting in recent memory, traders will still have plenty to digest Wednesday afternoon.\n\nRelated Analysis:", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: EUR/USD, US Dollar Index Futures.
