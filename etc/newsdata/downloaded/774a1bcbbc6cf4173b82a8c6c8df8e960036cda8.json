Most recently, a New York Times report detailed how ICE agents used Facebook and other social media to carry out a series of arrests in Oregon this summer.\n\nIn one instance, according to the report, an undocumented woman named Gladys D\u00edaz Tadeo made a Facebook post in a private buy/sell/trade group advertising a pi\u00f1ata that she had made with her three daughters. The next day, a Facebook account with a \"Hispanic name\" and a profile picture of a dog had responded to her listing.\n\nD\u00edaz agreed to meet the person by a local bank to sell them the pi\u00f1ata, the Times reports. When she arrived at the bank, however, two ICE agents were waiting to handcuff her. She was deported to Mexico three weeks later. The Facebook account that had responded to her listing was apparently deleted in the days that followed.\n\nRead more: Zuckerberg told employees that he would have been fired several times over if it weren't for his total control of Facebook\n\nThis isn't the first time ICE agents have reportedly used fake Facebook accounts to carry out arrests. The agency used a number of phony profiles from 2015 onward to lure undocumented students into a sting operation in Michigan, the Guardian reported.\n\nThe practice violates Facebook's rules, which prohibit \"inauthentic behavior\" including running accounts with fake names or accounts that mislead people.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. In April, a Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian that the company would take action against any fake profiles it becomes aware of. However, the use of fake profile by law enforcement agencies has persisted.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson declined to comment, citing an agency policy against commenting on \"investigative techniques, tactics or tools.\"", "description": "ICE agents reportedly used fake Facebook accounts to track undocumented immigrants and lure them into sting operations.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d96029991ca791fc27b9a61?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
