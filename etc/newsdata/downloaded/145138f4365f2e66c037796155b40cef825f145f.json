(Photo: Jon Kopaloff, Getty Images)\n\nDanielle Fishel has had a bumpy journey into motherhood \u2013 so she's here to tell mamas everywhere that they are \"amazing.\"\n\nThe \"Boy Meets World\" star announced in July she and husband Jensen Karp welcomed their son Adler Lawrence on June 24. He arrived four weeks early amid complications, Fishel shared in an Instagram post.\n\nIn a personal essay for \"Good Morning America,\" Fishel went into more detail about her son's scary first few months and how she has battled the inevitable mom guilt.\n\n\"Naively, and perhaps arrogantly, I thought, 'I'll never let myself have mom guilt,' \" the actress and director wrote.\n\n\"Then I had a baby.\"\n\nFishell said she went into labor four weeks early, and her doctor discovered fluid in Adler\u2019s chest cavity. Doctors attempted to stop contractions to allow Adler's lungs to develop, but a decrease in amniotic fluid meant they needed to induce her.\n\nThe mom guilt began then, before her son was even born.\n\n\"'Why did my water break so early? Was it because I was on my feet working 12-plus hour days at almost 36 weeks? Was it all the spicy food I had been craving? Did I do something that will hurt my baby?' \" she wrote.\n\nAdler fought fluid in his lungs weeks after his birth in his mom's effort to do what she thought was best: breastfeed him.\n\nThe \"fatty nature\" of her breast milk caused the fluid in his lungs to return, and they had to switch to a \"medium chain triglyceride formula,\" she said.\n\nThe guilt returned: \"Why is my milk hurting my child? Is my baby allergic to me?\"\n\nWhen Fishel returned to work, she worried about her son remembering who she is.\n\n\"None of us escape mom-guilt,\" she wrote. \"It\u2019s there whether you\u2019re a stay-at-home mom or work outside the house, but there is one thing I know for certain each and every mother has in common: We are trying our absolute best 100% of the time.\"\n\nShe reminded people that when they see moms in public and may want to judge them, \"know that there is a story there.\"\n\n\"Tell her she\u2019s doing an amazing job,\" she advised. \"Because you are, mama. I see you and you\u2019re doing great.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/14/danielle-fishel-haunted-mom-guilt-following-birth-her-baby/3977366002/", "description": "\"Boy Meets World\" star Danielle Fishel has had\u00a0a bumpy journey into motherhood.
