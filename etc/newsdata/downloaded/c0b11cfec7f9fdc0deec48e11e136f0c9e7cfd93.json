The court's ruling may go a long way to determine when, how and if Brexit happens. Voters, in a 2016 referendum, decided by a thin margin that Britain would leave the European Union.\n\nThe Supreme Court is hearing the case on appeal after a lower court -- the Court of Session in Edinburgh -- last week ruled in favor of Parliament, saying the prime minister's controversial suspension was \u201cunlawful because it had the purpose of stymieing Parliament\" and was therefore \"null and of no effect.\" Prior to that ruling, however, England's High Court had ruled in favor of Johnson, saying that his suspension of Parliament was not a matter for the courts.\n\nProtesters hold banners outside the Supreme Court in London, Tuesday Sept. 17, 2019.

Meanwhile, his opponents in Parliament claim he is stalling, strategizing and trying to reduce the political heat he has been taking over the possibility of leading Britain out of the EU without a deal.\n\nSupporting the legal challenge to the prime minister's suspension of Parliament in writing in the Supreme Court were some notable people and governments, including former British Prime Minister John Major, the government of Wales and the government of Scotland. The EU says that the biggest impediment to Johnson and Parliament making a Brexit deal is how the situation with the border with Ireland would be handled, if and when England is no longer part of the EU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least one prominent Northern Irish peace activist, Raymond McCord, whose son was killed during \"The Troubles,\" a conflict in Northern Ireland that began in the late 1960s and lasted about 30 years, is also supporting the legal challenge against Johnson in the Supreme Court. He wrote that peace in Ireland would potentially be jeopardized as a result of the fallout if Johnson follows through on his threat to take England out of the EU without a deal in place.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A lower court ruled that Boris Johnson suspending parliament was unlawful.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/AP19238594507487.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
