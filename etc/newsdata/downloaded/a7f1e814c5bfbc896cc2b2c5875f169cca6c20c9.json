No one knows how to play 100-ball cricket but so far it looks like they think spin is the one.\u201d\n\nWhile there maybe some quirks of the 100-ball game yet to be discovered, Curran \u2013 one of the England Test stars allocated prior to Sunday\u2019s draft \u2013 said the best guide anyone could use to date was Twenty20.\n\nSpinners were in high demand in the draft for The Hundred\n\n\u201cYou look at the timing of the tournament, late in the summer, so the wickets are drier but generally in T20, it\u2019s the spinners who win you a lot of games, in the middle overs they take a lot of wickets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll the spinners that have been picked are world class.\u201d\n\nChris Gayle, Lasith Malinga and Dwayne Bravo all notably missed out on selection, but there was no doubting the quality of the players who were picked up, with six Australians \u2013 including Steve Smith and David Warner \u2013 among those going for the top-priced \u00a3125k.\n\nIt was the first time a draft format had been used in British sport, leading to a tense night for many.\n\nEight incredibly talented teams... Can\u2019t wait!! pic.twitter.com/ajz5HugZ6i \u2014 Alex Hales (@AlexHales1) October 20, 2019\n\n\u201cIt was exciting to watch it,\u201d said Ben Stokes, who like Curran could enjoy a relaxed night, having already been allocated to the Northern Superchargers.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of guys here, Sam Billings and Ravi Bopara, who didn\u2019t know if they were going to get picked or not. Sam was hiding behind a pillar at one point!\n\n\u201cI knew who our first three were going to be, unless someone else picked them, and we got them.\u201d\n\nThe ECB will hope the strength of the teams selected on Sunday will help build excitement and quell controversy over the format, and that was certainly the message being pushed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how it\u2019s played over 100 balls, the subtle differences that will capture the imagination of a lot of people not just in England but globally as well,\u201d said Invincibles coach Tom Moody.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all well and good to stand back and throw stones at it but it\u2019s like when the Big Bash started in Australia years ago, people were more than happy to criticise a product but as soon as it started you couldn\u2019t stop people charging through the gates.\u201d\n\nCurran highlighted the opportunity for the young English players selected lower in the draft to learn from their new superstar team-mates, while Joe Root believes the timing of the tournament can help England sharpen up for next October\u2019s T20 World Cup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great time for it ahead of a T20 World Cup,\u201d the England captain said.\n\n\u201cIt will give a platform for our players to showcase themselves and go around the world, it will open doors and new relationships.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing for the game. It\u2019s taking shape nicely. It will also help players learn to deal with different pressures\u2026having \u00a3100k on your back as you walk out to bat for a young player is really good.\u201d", "description": "The eight city-based franchises signed the bulk of their squads in a televised draft on Sunday.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/wire-19987556-1571656139-135_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
