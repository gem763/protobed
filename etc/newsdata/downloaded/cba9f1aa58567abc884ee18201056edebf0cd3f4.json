Net revenue at Goldman\u2019s investing and lending division slumped 40 per cent as it swallowed a loss of about $80m (\u00a363m) on its stake in WeWork owner The We Company, along with hits from investments in Uber and two other companies.\n\nThe valuation of WeWork, an office-sharing startup, has plummeted from a peak of $47bn in January to as low as $10-12bn, forcing it to pull its IPO. Meanwhile, Uber\u2019s shares are down 24 per cent since the company went public earlier this year.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for more than a third of its overall revenue, but 6 per cent growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in other major businesses.\n\n\u201cOverall, GS posted mixed results this quarter,\u201d analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note to clients.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
