I come from a world of action, decisions, putting your money down, and seeing what happens,\u201d said Rooney, who was a successful businessman before coming to Congress in 2017. \u201cThis is a world of a talk. It\u2019s very difficult for me to just stand up and talk.\u201d\n\nRooney, who has been sitting in on closed-door depositions connected to the House\u2019s impeachment probe, has been one of the few Republicans to publicly express alarm over Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine.\n\nThe Florida Republican said Friday he was \u201cshocked\u201d by Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo, saying it would be difficult for the White House to walk back the comments and that it \u201cvery well could be\u201d a turning point in the Ukraine saga.\n\n\u201cHe basically said it\u2019s a quid pro quo, which is not a good thing,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThe only thing I can assume is he meant what he had to say. ... It\u2019s not an etch-a-sketch.\u201d\n\nRooney also said he was \u201cstill thinking about\u201d whether Trump\u2019s actions amounted to an impeachable offense.\n\nBut Rooney, a former ambassador to the Holy See, added that \u201cevery time an ambassador comes and talks, we learn a lot more.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful to me to see this kind of amateur diplomacy riding roughshod over our State Department apparatus,\u201d Rooney said.\n\nRooney\u2019s announcement has already set off jockeying for the heavily Republican southwest Florida seat. It\u2019s a region packed with ambitious state-level politicians, and wealthy potential self-funders who could make a play for the seat.\n\nFlorida House Majority Leader Dane Eagle, a Republican who has represented the region in the statehouse since 2012, said he is mulling a run.\n\n\u201cSouthwest Florida deserves consistent representation in Washington,\u201d Eagle said. \u201cI\u2019m certain we will have a slew of candidates throwing their name in the ring, and at this time my wife and I are carefully considering this opportunity.\u201d\n\nTerm-limited state Sen. Lizbeth Benacquisto said her focus for now remains on a special legislative session that will kick off next week. She ran for the House seat in a 2014 special election, but lost in the GOP primary to former Rep. Curt Clawson.\n\nOthers who would potentially consider a bid include state Rep. Byron Donalds and former state Rep. Matt Hudson.\n\nThe region is home to some of the wealthiest people in the nation, which can change the political calculus. Clawson and Rooney both financed their own races, elbowing aside candidates considered more a part of Florida\u2019s political establishment.\n\nRooney, for his part, insisted this week he wasn't concerned about invoking Trump's wrath with his impeachment remarks. \u201cWhat\u2019s he\u2019s going to do to me?\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cI took this job to do the right thing, at all times, and if that means I gotta go back to my other job, that\u2019s okay, too,\u201d Rooney added. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people around here who are seriously concerned about being criticized by the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to get the facts and do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking at anybody in this building.\u201d\n\nRooney has sometimes been a lone wolf in the GOP, breaking with the party on issues such as climate change. He told POLITICO he is satisfied with his accomplishments in Congress, including securing funding to restore the Everglades, and moving legislation to ban offshore drilling, which passed the House and is awaiting action in the Senate.\n\n\"I wanted to raise the profile of southwest Florida,\" said Rooney, who won reelection last year by 24 points.\n\nRooney follows other Republican critics of Trump who've announced their retirements \u2014 such as Texas Rep. Will Hurd \u2014 or left the party, in the case of Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who became an independent. So far this cycle, 21 GOP lawmakers have decided to retire, resign or run for higher office.\n\nDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d0/cd/6a8402d64c47b4123fa1a7f23bf0/191019-francis-rooney-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
