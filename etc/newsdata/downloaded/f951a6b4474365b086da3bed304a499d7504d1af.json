They\u2019re also still leading the Pac-12 South after a 41-14 victory over the Wildcats on Saturday night.\n\nChriston rushed for 88 of his 103 yards in the fourth quarter of an electrifying debut for the Trojans (4-3, 3-1 Pac-12). The San Diego native flew past the Arizona secondary on a 55-yard TD run early in the fourth quarter, and he added a 30-yard TD sprint down the middle less than five minutes later.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great football players on this team, so it\u2019s hard to judge his speed,\u201d USC coach Clay Helton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to have that feeling and know that when the play breaks, if he\u2019s even, he\u2019s leavin\u2019.\u201d\n\nKedon Slovis threw touchdown passes to Michael Pittman Jr. and Tyler Vaughns as USC remained unbeaten at the Coliseum this season and atop the division alongside Utah, which lost to USC last month.\n\nAlthough Christon provided the fireworks, USC beat Arizona for the seventh straight time mostly because of a dominant defensive performance against Khalil Tate and the Wildcats (4-3, 2-2), holding them to 167 yards and no points in the first three quarters.\n\n\u201cI believe our defense is all together, so when one makes a play, everybody makes a play,\u201d said USC linebacker Kana\u2019i Mauga, who had 13 tackles and an interception in a breakthrough performance. \u201cEverybody was hype on the sideline. It was a great atmosphere.\u201d\n\nTate passed for 47 yards and was sacked six times before touted freshman Grant Gunnell replaced him in the third quarter for the Wildcats, who have lost two straight after a four-game winning streak. USC led 34-0 before Brian Casteel took a short pass from Gunnell 56 yards for Arizona\u2019s first points with 12:12 to play.\n\nGunnell passed for 196 yards and hit Casteel for two touchdowns long after the game was decided.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t protect tonight,\u201d Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said. \u201cThey got pressure on us even without blitzing. We\u2019ve got to be able to run the ball more effectively. We weren\u2019t consistent enough.\u201d\n\nINJURIES MOUNT\n\nSlovis passed for 232 yards without a turnover as USC won easily despite six more significant injuries for a team that has already used three quarterbacks this season.\n\nThe Trojans began the night without their top three cornerbacks and defensive end Christian Rector due to injury, and they lost top safety Talanoa Hufanga to a shoulder injury in the first half and star freshman defensive end Drake Jackson to an ankle injury in the second half. Running backs Stephen Carr (hamstring) and Markese Stepp (ankle) also picked up injuries during the game.\n\nEnter Christon, who looked ready for the spotlight while taking handoffs from Slovis, whose freshman breakthrough performance due to an injury occurred just six weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI just followed my blockers and the O-line opened up a huge hole for me,\u201d Christon said of his first TD run.\n\nDEFENSE DOMINATES\n\nUSC\u2019s defense caused constant problems for Tate from the opening drive, and the Trojans scored their first 10 points on short fields created by Arizona turnovers. Stepp then capped an 87-yard drive by scoring from 12 yards out to put USC up 17-0 shortly before halftime.\n\nGunnell threw an interception shortly after relieving Tate, leading to three more points for USC.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t connect as a unit,\u201d said Arizona running back J.J. Taylor, who rushed for 80 yards. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put everything together to be successful. We\u2019ve just got to game-plan better for next time.\u201d\n\n0 FOR LA\n\nTate missed his final chance to beat USC during his career with the Wildcats out of nearby Serra High, a hotbed for Trojans talent. The Inglewood native made his first career start against USC as a 17-year-old freshman, but failed in four opportunities for a win over his hometown program.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nArizona: Sumlin said immediately after the game that Tate will start next week, but the Wildcats have a decision to make at the position soon. Tate\u2019s struggles in Los Angeles obviously weren\u2019t entirely his fault, but Gunnell is the future for a program that might need to move on from Tate\u2019s thrilling, but not incredibly successful, tenure.\n\nUSC: The Trojans have plenty of work to do, but they\u2019re still in the driver\u2019s seat in the Pac-12 South with their win over Utah. Injuries could be the biggest obstacle between USC and the league title game, but the Trojans looked fairly sharp while moving one step closer.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArizona: Another trip to California to face struggling Stanford on Saturday.\n\nUSC: A short week of preparation for a trip to snowy Colorado on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kenan Christon only got in the game because the first three tailbacks on Southern California's depth chart were all hurt and the fourth-stringer had just fumbled.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/arizona_usc_football_23051_c0-91-2184-1365_s1200x700.jpg?bc34dd6e4f9ca2d0aa11593f18d4081e6780ddd3", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
