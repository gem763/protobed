Col. Vindman \u2014 the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, who fought in the Iraq War and received the Purple Heart \u2014 as having conflicting loyalties because he was born in Ukraine and emigrated with his family to the U.S. as a young child.\n\n\u201cHey, Laura Ingraham, you\u2019re attacking a decorated veteran to protect Donald Trump? Who do you think you are, Donald Trump?\u201d asked Meyers, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, yes. Col. Vindman emigrated from Ukraine when he was 3. Nobody even remembers where they were when they were 3, with the possible exception of you. I\u2019m sure when you were 3, you were already at Saks Fifth Avenue making a salesperson cry,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cAnd, hey, do you really think it\u2019s smart to attack veterans on Fox News?\u201d he added. \u201cVeterans make up a pretty good chunk of your audience. I think it goes: veterans, people visiting their elderly relatives, and rageaholic golfers age 73 and up.\u201d\n\nCheck out the segment above.", "description": "He tore into Ingraham over her attempted smearing of national security official Alexander Vindman.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db9371220000010355072d6.png?cache=zgvs5wclgp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
