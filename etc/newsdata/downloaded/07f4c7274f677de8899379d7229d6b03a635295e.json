The Conservatives would try to win over supporters of Nigel Farage, pictured in Camborne yesterday\n\nBrussels and the UK remain locked in talks as the Halloween divorce deadline approaches and while there are plenty of positive noises that a deal is possible there is also plenty of pessimism that things could still fall apart.\n\nIf the PM has not agreed a deal with the EU by October 19 he is legally required under the Benn Act to ask the bloc to push back the UK's departure date to the end of January next year.\n\nThe leaked leaflets appear to suggest that the Conservatives are readying themselves just in case the PM is forced into a Brexit delay.\n\nOpposition leaders including Jeremy Corbyn have said they will support a snap poll if and when a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out.\n\nIf an extension is agreed with the bloc in the coming weeks that could then put the nation on course for an election at the end of November or in December.\n\nThe leaflets seemingly give a clue as to what could be the Tories' strategy at such an election.\n\nIt appears Mr Johnson would focus on hammering home the idea that a vote for any party other than the Tories would lead to further Brexit delays.\n\nWinning over supporters of the Brexit Party will be key to Mr Johnson's election strategy regardless of the circumstances in which the poll is held.\n\nHis strategy is believed to be based on trying to unite every Leave voter behind a single party.\n\nIf Mr Farage's party continues to perform strongly in the polls Mr Johnson could well struggle to win a majority.\n\nThe Brexit Party leader has offered Mr Johnson a pact if the PM switches to supporting a No Deal divorce as his preferred option.\n\nMr Johnson has rebuffed the offer and said his preference remains the UK leaving the EU with an agreement.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, pictured yesterday at the state opening of Parliament, has said he will support an early general election if and when a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out\n\nOther Tory leaflets leaked to the BBC set out how the party could go after other voters.\n\nOne apparently warns people in seats where the Lib Dems could win that every vote for Jo Swinson's party would make it 'more likely that no party gets a majority' leading to 'more confusion, more delay and more indecision'.\n\nAnother, potentially designed for Labour/Tory battlegrounds, claims that Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit strategy 'is more delay'.\n\n'They can't decide whether they support or oppose Brexit - and they've had three years to make up their minds,' the leaflet apparently states.\n\nA Conservative Party spokeswoman dismissed the suggestion that the Tories were preparing to fight an election based on a Brexit delay.\n\nThey said: 'This is nonsense. The Prime Minister has made it clear - repeatedly - that we will leave the EU on the 31st October.\n\n'These leaflets simply set out the clear risk that a coalition of political parties that have sworn, in opposition, to do everything they can to reverse Brexit would, in government, do precisely that.'", "description": "Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party are preparing to fight the next general election on the assumption that Brexit has not yet happened, according to leaked campaign documents.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19742476-0-image-a-76_1571147977916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
