Figueroa, a college student studying comparative literature, had been arrested multiple times while in the streets and was starting to notice a pattern.\n\n\u201cI have been arrested in protests three times and all three times I was doing nothing,\u201d says Figueroa. \u201cI asked myself: \u2018Why do the police arrest me so much?\u2019 And obviously it wasn\u2019t until I understood that I\u2019m an easy target for the police because I\u2019m a black woman.\u201d\n\nFigueroa is one of many vocal activists, scholars, legal advocates and residents, who say Puerto Rican police racially profile black and predominantly low-income communities, despite frequently held beliefs that the island is a racial melting pot without explicit racial problems.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen black people being policed at the entrance of the shops, how they follow me and they don\u2019t do anything to my friends or to white people,\u201d said Figueroa.\n\n\u201cThe police in Puerto Rico are very racist and also have a lot of social stigmas because they believe that black people come from the hood, come to steal \u2026 that we are criminals.\n\n\u201cThe police are the same as in the United States, the only difference is that here they don\u2019t kill us,\u201d said Figueroa.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s police department has been under federally mandated reform since 2012, after accusations of unlawful searches, excessive force, corruption and other failures of leadership. One of the areas of compliance for the department includes non-discrimination and equal protection under the law.\n\nSacha Antonetty-Lebron, a writer and founder of Revista \u00c9tnica, a new magazine dedicated to celebrating Afro-Latino issues in Puerto Rico, said she too experienced racial profiling from law enforcement, but at a federal level.\n\n\u201cAbout nine years ago I had a situation in Hato Rey, where an Ice customs agent intervened with me and started asking me, \u2018Who are you, and are you from here, give me your license.\u2019 And I told him, \u2018I\u2019m Puerto Rican. I\u2019m from here,\u2019 and he kept asking,\u201d recalled Antonetty-Lebron.\n\nAntonetty-Lebron believes the customs agent assumed she was Dominican because of her dark brown skin.\n\n\u201cI remember that day I went back to work and I was crying, shaking. I shared it with some of my classmates, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal for them,\u201d she says.\n\nWhat complicates broader investigations about racism and police brutality in Puerto Rico is a lack of data. The department doesn\u2019t track the race of victims of officer-involved homicides or excessive force complaints.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of resistance because people say \u2018That\u2019s a US thing, that doesn\u2019t apply here,\u2019 or \u2018It has nothing to do with us,\u2019\u201d said Dr B\u00e1rbara I Abad\u00eda-Rexach, a sociology professor at the University of Puerto Rico. \u201cThere are no statistics that say the amount of black people that have been accused or charged with certain crimes.\u201d\n\nAbad\u00eda-Rexach highlights the 2017 the case of Alma Yarida Cruz, an 11-year-old schoolgirl whose school principal called police to arrest her, after she fought against bullies who taunted her with racial slurs.\n\nCruz\u2019s case became a rallying point for her community as they protested against criminal charges filed against the child and a lack of institutional support for the racism she endured.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one example of criminalization and persecution of black people since infancy,\u201d said Abad\u00eda-Rexach. \u201cAfter that case, there was another of a kid \u2026 who recorded a video for social media threatening his friends at the school with a firearm. He wasn\u2019t arrested, he wasn\u2019t handcuffed. The difference? He was a white, rich 16-year-old from a private school.\u201d\n\nEven black police officers themselves have reported being subject to racism. In 2015, Yolanda Carrasquillo settled with the Puerto Rico police department after making claims that she and other dark-skinned police employees were regularly subjected to racial slurs by a civilian co-worker.\n\nDespite a history of racial mixing on the island, nearly 80% of Puerto Ricans identified as white on the 2010 census, something many experts critiqued as both impossible and inaccurate. However, a growing number of Puerto Ricans are now identifying as Afro-Latino or Afro-Latinx. The term Afro-LatinX or Afro-descendiente (African descendant) is embraced by some as a form of cultural pride and acknowledgment of African ancestry, which undergirds many aspects of Puerto Rican culture, from food to salsa music.\n\nBut others regard the term Afro-Latinx or identifying as \u201cblack\u201d as unnecessary. To them it\u2019s divisive and a trend that mimics the segregated mindset of the US mainland.\n\n\u201cI call myself Puerto Rican,\u201d says \u201cJunior\u201d Eliezer Pizarro, a local musician from the predominantly black town of Loiza on the north-east coast. Pizarro teaches traditional African-inspired music called bomba and says he\u2019s proud of his African heritage. \u201cWe are descendants of Africa most of us. But I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m African.\u201d\n\nPizarro says that if Puerto Rican police treat his mostly black community differently, it\u2019s mainly through neglect.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of police. An accident is happening right now and the police may not come until the next day. You know, it\u2019s lack of security.\u201d\n\nRecent political events have thrust the issue into the island\u2019s politics.\n\nAfter leaked private chats showed top officials using sexist, homophobic and offensive language, hundreds of thousands of Puerto Rican protestors successfully pressured the resignation of both Rossell\u00f3 and his appointed successor as governor, Pedro Pierluisi.\n\nNow with a broad coalition of support for civic change on the island, activists like Nina Figueroa have a sense that racist policing in Puerto Rico can be addressed.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that this is the first time I\u2019ve seen a movement or a group of people take the streets that is so diverse,\u201d says Figueroa. \u201cNormally you went to these spaces and most of the people were middle-class men, who had access to academia, politicians, unions or to labor groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had been feeling very disappointed and pessimistic in the last year. But I have been changing my opinion because I have seen many black people, many people from the LGBT community, many women coming out \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conversation is opening up and space is being given \u2013 not just a movement against the government [but] for an anti-racist movement to begin. I have hope and confidence for a change.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.", "description": "Activists say police racially profile black communities, despite Puerto Rico\u2019s image as a melting pot without racial problems", "authors": ["Natasha S Alford"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1802ed0fc752b9564cc021ce41673399c100470b/0_60_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f5ba27698453901902668210db164080", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
