Tokyo has taken to the celebration in a big way in recent years, and in retrospect it makes perfect sense, since Halloween has provided an opportunity to do three things Japan absolutely loves:\n\n1. Dress up in costumes\n\nEat sweets Engage in a massive amount of drinking\n\nThe third item on that list may or may not be part of the Halloween festivities in your neck of the woods, but in Tokyo the booze has flowed freely at the Halloween celebrations which take place in the capital\u2019s Shibuya district . A multi-night, unofficial party, revelers roam the streets around Shibuya Station snapping photos and knocking back adult beverages all night long not just on Halloween itself, but on the weekend before Oct 31 as well.\n\nBut in recent years, things have been taking increasingly ugly turns, with several high-profile incidents of vandalism and drunken mayhem, including tipping over a truck in 2018. The rowdiness has even begun to affect the neighborhood\u2019s international image, as one visiting foreigner who was arrested for vandalism last year told the police: \u201cI\u2019d heard that Halloween in Japan is crazy, and that every year people do things like this. I thought I wouldn\u2019t get hauled in even if I got drunk and went crazy in Shibuya.\u201d\n\nSo this year, Shibuya is saying enough is enough, and the local government is instituting a ban on public alcohol consumption in a wide area that stretches across several blocks, and which traditionally sees the highest concentration of partiers.\n\n\u25bc Drinking will be banned in the pink area.\n\nThe map\u2019s Japanese text denotes:\n\nTokyu Hands (Shibuya branch) Jinnan Post Office Tokyu Department Store (main branch) Shibuya Loft Bunkamura-dori Street Dogenzaka Street Statue of Hachiko JR Shibuya Station Shibuya Mark City National Route 246 Shuto Kosoku expressway\n\nIn addition to the specifically mentioned landmarks, the alcohol ban area also includes the famous Shibuya Scramble intersection, Center-gai shopping street, and intersection in front of the iconic Shibuya 109 shopping tower. The ban will be in effect on Oct 25, 26, 27, and 31, starting at 6 p.m. and continuing until 5 o\u2019clock the next morning (with the exception of Oct 27, when the ban will be in effect from 6 p.m. to midnight).\n\nNote that while public consumption of alcohol is prohibited on those nights, Shibuya\u2019s numerous restaurants, pubs, and bars will still be allowed to serve as much booze as they want to thirsty customers, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll have to stay sober all night long, just that you can\u2019t try to shake that status while out on the streets.\n\nSource: Shibuya Ward official website via IT Media\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Shibuya mayor fed up with lawless Tokyo Halloween street party, promises stronger police response\n\n-- Foreigner investigated for truck-flipping thought it\u2019d be OK since \u201cJapan is crazy at Halloween\u201d\n\n-- Japanese police requests train stations in Shibuya to shut exits during New Year countdown\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/22/tokyos-shibuya-bans-public-drinking-for-halloween-and-heres-the-affected-area%E3%80%90map%E3%80%91/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Halloween is just around the corner, and you can feel the excitement in the air.
