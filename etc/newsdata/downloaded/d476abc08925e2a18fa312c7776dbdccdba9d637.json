The Saints had been screwed again.\n\nAn obvious, yet uncalled, pass interference penalty had cost the Saints a trip to the Super Bowl in the NFC championship game last season. What followed was a torrent of outrage reaching levels possibly never before seen in the NFL. The league was pushed enough to change its rules, lawsuits and petitions to replay the game were filed, death threats were sent to the offending Rams player and discourse over the matter reached Congress.\n\nNow, a game featuring the same teams saw a pivotal call blown almost as badly in the same direction.\n\nWith that in mind, Buffalo Wild Wings fired off this tweet in response to the latest blown call. Funnily enough, the tweet is still up.\n\nNew Orleans fans already drawing up lawsuits. \u2014 Buffalo Wild Wings (@BWWings) September 15, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThat seven-word tweet was apparently so callous and offensive that it attracted a fire hose of outrage from Saints fans, who complained enough that the Buffalo Wild Wings central office felt the need to apologize, per NOLA.com.\n\n\u201cWe apologize for our tweet, which was not meant to offend Saints fans,\u201d an email reportedly said. \u201cWe intended to point out another bad call in a fun way. In fact, our Director of Social Media is a die-hard Saints fan who attended the NFC Championship game earlier this year.\u201d\n\nAccording to the story, the owner of a New Orleans-area BWW franchise reported a dip in business Monday, while some fans vowed online to boycott the chain. Over a tweet. From a chicken restaurant.\n\nSome Saints fans are never entering a Buffalo Wild Wings again. (Rick Wilson/AP Images for Buffalo Wild Wings)\n\nThis whole thing is extremely silly\n\nLook, we could probably talk for hours about the emotional state of Saints fans amid all these bad breaks and everything they\u2019ve done to make sure the world knows how much the sport of football has wronged them. However, stating in plain terms what is happening here shows how absolutely ridiculous this situation has become:\n\nAn NFL fanbase got extremely mad at a chicken wing franchise over a seven-word tweet mocking how some of their own filed a federal lawsuit over a bad call in a football game. And it got so bad the chain apologized.\n\nThe tweet didn\u2019t even mock the Saints over the bad call and loss, it was completely focused on how some Saints fans, again, literally made a federal case to demand that the NFC championship game be replayed in the week before the Super Bowl. It still seemed to cross a line.\n\nFun times we live in.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Buffalo Wild Wings should probably just be happy Saints fans aren't suing the chain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5LdPn1Dhm32Ew9oZ95bDPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTQuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m4EssNzEbPYPI1iQRz4p7g--~B/aD0zNDA1O3c9NTEwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/0b5c1490-d9b6-11e9-beee-1c87b2cccaa7", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
