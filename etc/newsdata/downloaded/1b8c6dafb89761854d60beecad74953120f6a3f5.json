Sawyer asked, to which Cameron nodded in reply: 'My rib cage, my neck\u2026'\n\nCameron told Sawyer: 'I thought that I was not put together properly and since that was the case, I was just going to take it as far as I could take it.'\n\nIn a clip that followed where he was questioned alongside his father, Michael swallows back tears as Cameron shares: 'It was almost like the one thing I could count on and I didn't have the courage to move forward without it.'\n\nWhen Sawyer asked Michael if he ever thought there was more he could've tried to help his son, the actor laughed: 'You wrack your brains... In the beginning you start blaming yourself, then you look at your genetic makeup.\n\n'My career was first. My career came before my family. My marriage was not great so you do hide yourself in your work.\n\n'I should've focused more on my family but that's hard to say when you're in the midst of a career. You're stepping out of your father's shadow, trying to create a life for your own.'\n\nThe clip aired on GMA Tuesday featuring Diane Sawyer's chat with Cameron's father Michael Douglas, who admitted he blamed genetic makeup but then confessed his career came first\n\nMichael also put focus on stepping out of his dad Kirk's shadow, and 'trying to create a life' of his own\n\nMichael and his father Kirk tried to get Cameron clean by signing him up to appear in movie It Runs in the Family with them\n\nMichael hired people to kidnap Cameron and take him to rehab but aborted plan after his son became too aggressive and was about to kill someone or himself\n\nAt first Michael and his acting legend father Kirk, now 102, tried to rescue him by agreeing he could star in movie It Runs in the Family alongside the pair if he got clean.\n\nLater on, problems got so bad between the father and son that Michael hired two people to kidnap Cameron and take him to rehab but the addict got so aggressive that the mission was called off.\n\nCameron revealed that he and his father didn't speak for 'quite a while' after that.\n\n'I think I was so angry because I was so angry at myself,' Cameron opened up.\n\nIn the emotional chat with Sawyer, Michael told his son: 'You were either going to kill somebody or you were going to kill yourself.'\n\n'We reached a point where I was going to lose him, based on everything I'd seen, and I was not willing to emotionally commit anymore,' Michael opened up.\n\nMichael Douglas and Diandra Douglas during 60th Annual Academy Awards. The actor mentioned his bad marriage when addressing why his son spiraled out of control\n\nHe pays testament to his father's second wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, for 'pushing [Michael] to extend his paternal love to me\n\nCameron told Sawyer it was 'heartbreaking' to have to ask his father 'don't you love me anymore' after he was cut off. However Michael explained his thinking.\n\n'At what point do you protect yourself or other loved ones around you before you get dragged in and it falls apart?' Michael asked Sawyer.\n\nIn his book, Cameron wrote how his father made him hand out joints to celebrity party guests when he was a child before he became hooked on heroin.\n\nThe memoir reveals how Hollywood legend Michael had been so preoccupied with partying during his time atop the upper echelons of tinsel town that he hired a busboy to act as a 'more constant male influence' for his young son so he could avoid the responsibility.\n\nIn later years, Cameron suffered with cocaine and heroin addiction, sold crystal meth and led a life of self-destruction that, in 2009, went on to land him in prison.\n\n'It's strange growing up seeing your father and grandfather as giants projected on screens and billboards . . . It's diminishing to be perceived mainly as someone else's son,' Cameron writes in that book. 'How do you compete with Kirk Douglas? How do you live in Michael Douglas' shadow?'\n\nThough he makes clear in the book he blames only himself for the squandering of his privileged beginnings, Cameron was exposed to the partying scene from an early age\n\nCameron recalls one interaction with Michael (pictured together in 2009) where he explicitly told him it was impossible to develop a relationship with him. 'I think you're going to overdose, or someone's going to kill you, or you're going to kill someone. I'm trying to prepare myself emotionally,' Michael reportedly said to him\n\nThough now the 40-year-old has set his sights on an acting career, in his younger years he chose to follow his father's footsteps down a different and much darker path \u2013 one that led to a lifestyle of deviance fueled by drug use\n\n'Even as a really young kid, I remember running joints back and forth,' Cameron said of his dad's parties, which regularly featured a bevy of stars including the likes of Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito.\n\n'Dad would say, 'Hey, bring this over to your uncle,' and I would, not realizing until years later what it had been. As I got older, I would creep from house to house on the compound, climbing balconies and seeing more than I was supposed to: beautiful grown-ups doing the things that beautiful grown-ups living lives of excess do.'\n\nCameron would then wait for dawn to descend and for his dad's famous friends to retire to their rooms before rifling through their bags, minesweeping any substances they'd left behind.\n\nIt was after such parties that Cameron remember his dad would always take him for early morning breakfasts at a hotel in Sunset Boulevard.\n\nBut it was only years later the true reason behind the father-son moments \u2013 which were otherwise fleeting \u2013 became clear: Cameron realized his father was coming down from drugs after a long night of partying.\n\nFor years, Cameron suffered with cocaine and heroin addiction, sold crystal meth and led a life of self-destruction that, in 2009, went on to land him eight years in jail.\n\nAs Michael's career demanded he spend more and more time away from home, one summer he came to the conclusion that his young son needed a 'more constant male influence' in his life.\n\nDuring a lunch with Cameron's mother, Diandra, at the Ivy in Beverly Hills, Michael identified a busboy hovering near their table as the ideal candidate.\n\n'Dad said, 'What about this guy? He seems very capable. He could be a houseman or something like that.' Mom spoke to him in Spanish . . . he was from El Salvador,' Cameron writes. 'Soon [he] was living with us. He took care of me from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep.'\n\nBut Cameron says he was left heartbroken at aged 10 when the busboy-come-makeshift father figure was fired after Diandra found vodka bottles under his bed and asked him to stop drinking, but he refused.\n\nA few years later, Cameron had to contend with the difficult news his father had checked into rehab for sex addiction after Diandra caught him in bed with another woman.\n\nCameron says his mother gave Michael an ultimatum that he had to 'deal with his drug and alcohol intake' or she would leave him. Two weeks later he checked into the Sierra Tuscon clinic in Arizona.\n\nBut his infidelity continued, and Diandra reached breaking point in 1995, when a private investigator caught him entering the Beverly Wilshire hotel with another woman.\n\nBut his parent's broken marriage did little to solidify more of a union with his father. In fact, Cameron recalls one interaction with Michael where he explicitly told him it was impossible to develop a relationship with him.\n\nThough his later conviction would act as a catalyst in turning his life around, in the decades before Cameron had a number or run-ins with the law and enjoyed a series near misses for which he was never arrested.\n\nThe Hollywood scion recounted one instance at an LA motel where he held up an elderly cashier with an air gun, demanding she open the cash register.\n\nThough she quickly obliged, all that was inside was a single $20 bill. But still, Cameron snatched the measly amount and ran - confessing the act it was more for the adrenaline than it was about money.\n\n'I like confusing people, making them puzzle over how someone who came from so much privilege can do such crazy sh**,' Cameron admits.\n\nHis penchant for chaos would see him arrested in New York City in 1999 for cocaine possession, and again six-years-later when police in LA found heroin and crack in his car.\n\nIn 2007 he was charged with possession of a controlled substance after police pulled over his car in Santa Barbara and found a syringe of liquid cocaine in the vehicle.\n\nIn his new book, Long Way Home, Cameron Douglas (left) admits he may have been born into Hollywood royalty, but his life has been anything but a fairy-tale. The son of Michael Douglas (right), 75, and the grandson of silver-screen legend, Kirk Douglas, 102, Cameron reveals the difficulties he grappled with growing up in the long shadow cast by his paternal lineage\n\nHis final arrest would come two years later in a sting operation in the Gansevoort hotel in Manhattan, where he later pleaded guilty to heroin possession and conspiracy to distribute drugs.\n\nHe was originally sentenced to five years in prison, but in 2011, Cameron was issued an additional four-and-a-half years for possession of contraband that tested positive for cocaine and heroin.\n\nBut despite the uncountable ups-and-downs, Cameron can remember the elation he felt when he was visited by his father and Kirk, who he calls 'Pappy', at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Manhattan before his sentencing in 2009.\n\nCameron Douglas' book, Long Way Home, will be released on Tuesday\n\n'I'm so impressed by Pappy, and touched. He's ninety-three, and he's come all the way from California to see me,' Cameron writes, adding Kirk told him 'That's my boy', when he informed him he'd been emerging victorious in a number of prison fights.\n\nDuring his seven years behind bars, Cameron got a large tattoo of his father and grandfather on his torso, in an ode to overcoming the conflictions he felt growing up in their shadows.\n\n'I've never been able to overcome my conflicting feelings about my last name, my pride in it and at the same time, my discomfort with having it define how other people see me,' he writes.\n\n'When I get their faces tattooed on my body, I feel ready, finally, to show an uncomplicated pride in them. When I show the tattoo to Dad, he seems embarrassed.'\n\nCameron was eventually released from prison in 2016. He moved into a halfway house in the Bronx before later moving into an apartment in TriBeca with his yoga instructor girlfriend, Viviane Thibes.\n\nHe pays testament to his father's second wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, for 'pushing [Michael] to extend his paternal love to me.\n\n'One day, we're hanging out and [my dad] says, 'I don't know how you did it. How you went through the things you did.' It's the first time he's ever acknowledged it quite like that,' Cameron says.\n\nIn December 2017, Cameron became a father himself when Viviane gave birth to their first daughter together, Lua Izzy Douglas.\n\nThey live in Hollywood Hills where Cameron is now pursuing a career as an actor and working to rebuild a relationship with his family.\n\n'[My father and I] never really became friends, as many father and sons do at a certain point, but now we're starting to do that,' Cameron writes.\n\n'We're forming the relationship I've always wanted.'", "description": "Cameron Douglas spoke about his drug addiction in an interview with Diane Sawyer, saying to his father Michael in the clip aired on GMA Tuesday: 'It was almost like the one thing I could count on.'", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com", "Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20038774-0-image-a-15_1571753530755.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
