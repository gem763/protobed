Men\u2019s brains are more like waffles. They\u2019re better able to focus because the information collects in each little waffle square.\u2019\n\nThat little nugget came from an Ernst & Young training session, not in 1952, but last year, according to the HuffPost.\n\nAlso, women\u2019s clothing must flatter but not be too revealing because, of course, \u201csexuality scrambles the mind.\u201d What\u2019s more, the fairer sex should look healthy and fit, with a \u201cgood haircut\u201d and \u201cmanicured nails.\u201d\n\nThese were all bits of advice reportedly given to some 30 female executives in the accounting firm\u2019s new office in Hoboken, N.J., in June 2018, an attendee who was appalled by the presentation told the HuffPost.\n\nThe seminar took place a few months after Ernst & Young settled a discrimination complaint filed by Jessica Casucci, a partner at the firm who said she was sexually assaulted years before by a male partner. She complained internally, but the man was fired only after her complaints went public.\n\nErnst & Young told the HuffPost that the event was the last time that version of training, which was created by someone outside of the company, was held and it \u201cis no longer offered in its current form.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny isolated aspects are taken wholly out of context,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding that participants in the seminar rated it highly.\n\nHere are just a couple excerpts from the program:\n\nThere\u2019s so much more.\n\nOn a long list of \u201cinvisible rules\u201d for men and women, the presentation says women often \u201cspeak briefly\u201d and \u201coften ramble and miss the point\u201d in meetings, whereas men will \u201cspeak at length because he really believes in his idea.\u201d\n\nHere are some other notes that the source took during her time at the seminar: 1) Don\u2019t confront men at meetings because it\u2019s perceived as a threat. 2) When a woman talks to a man, she should cross her legs and sit at an angle to him. 3) Women\u2019s brains are 6% to 11% smaller than men\u2019s.\n\n\u201cYou have to be the stereotype of what a woman is,\u201d the source said, explaining that she\u2019s sharing this information in hopes Ernst & Young will change. \u201cYou have to offer your thoughts in a benign way. You have to be the perfect Stepford wife.\u201d\n\nAs part of a problem facing the broader industry, the HuffPost pointed out that women comprise only 12% of Ernst & Young\u2019s lead client service partners, and that, overall, only 20.4% of the company\u2019s partners and principals are women.", "description": "Last year, the accounting giant held a training seminar at its new office in Hoboken, N.J., that one female attendee said was appalling, according to the...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT703_gender_MG_20191021110930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
