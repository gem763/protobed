The hooker, who has captained Argentina 49 times, spent two seasons in the Premiership with Worcester and also believes that gives him inside knowledge on the Pumas\u2019 opponents this weekend.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes [their structure] is boring but it\u2019s good for England, and it works,\u201d he said. \u201cI spent a lot of time there and it was great. I improved a lot in the way I see rugby, and I understand a lot about how the England boys see rugby. They are really structured.\n\nKyle Sinckler backs England\u2019s forward \u2018tank\u2019 to handle Argentina\u2019s power Read more\n\n\u201cMaybe my play in Worcester helped to see the way it will come on Saturday. They always play the same way in history. They are really structured and that for me is really good. I improved a lot.\u201d\n\nCreevy relinquished the Argentina captaincy after four years in 2018 but he remains one of the most feared hookers in world rugby. He has faced England five times and lost on each occasion \u2013 the Pumas have not won in their past nine meetings since their 2009 victory \u2013 but he is relishing the challenge that awaits.\n\n\u201cSaturday is going to be like a war, it\u2019s like a final for us,\u201d said Creevy, who arrived at Worcester in 2013. \u201cI think the battle with the forwards will be the game. We need to win the scrum, win the lineout, win the maul, win the contact, the breakdown.\n\n\u201cWhen we put on this shirt we feel something different. It\u2019s our country, our family, my club. We play together, the group is really bonded. That is different to different teams. We love each other, and I think that is different to other teams. We are friends, we are brothers, inside and outside the field.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nArgentina are traditionally known for a strong set-piece being the bedrock of their game. Their scrum was among the most disappointing aspects of a poor Rugby Championship this summer, but was vastly improved in their narrow defeat by France in their opening match.\n\nRugby World Cup refereeing confusion is hindering drive to grow game | Andy Bull Read more\n\n\u201cWe trained a lot. Our skills in the scrums and the mentality, we worked a lot in that,\u201d Creevy said. \u201cI think we are improving a lot in the scrum and we feel good, but we need to continue. The England scrum is really good.\u201d\n\nCreevy is vying for selection in the No 2 jersey with Julian Montoya, who scored a hat-trick and was named man of the match in the victory against Tonga on Saturday. The 34-year-old is certain to be part of the matchday squad, however, and win his 88th international cap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud. I can\u2019t explain with words, and in English it\u2019s really difficult. I\u2019m really proud to get 88 games with this shirt. I never imagined that, it\u2019s a dream for me. I\u2019m really happy. I think about my club, family, a lot of things I did and that was hard. Now I think about it and say it was really great.\u201d", "description": "The Argentina hooker Agustin Creevy has described England as boring and claimed that the World Cup match on Saturday will be \u2018like a war\u2019", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fbf750eaf8d610f64549c83e02f783879a9cad6/104_52_2670_1601/master/2670.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff1f4743d937e4ce81a1e23840110c9c", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
