Your partner then needs to grab your legs to hold you steady, and each leg should be on either side of their hips. Imagine that your bodies are in the shape of a cross.\n\nThen, reach out towards the wall and brace yourself against it as your partner slowly \u2013 and carefully \u2013 penetrates you.\n\nThis is a very tricky position, so if you have a bad back or don\u2019t have a suitable chair, use your bed instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s exactly the same, but you lie across the bed, while your partner does you from behind, but while standing on the floor. Once again, keep your legs straight on either side of the other person\u2019s body, so that it appears as if they are riding a broom.\n\nTo make it really witch-like, we suggest a little cackle now and then, too.\n\nThe Hogwarts witch or wizard\n\nPotterheads will appreciate this one.\n\nGet yourself in the sitting witch position, but add a few props.\n\nThe person on the floor will have a wand (butt plug) and can pop this into the other person\u2019s bum, gently playing with them during the sex.\n\nYelling out magic spells is optional, but we\u2019d stay away from \u2018Avada Kedavra\u2019 \u2013 it might give the wrong impression.\n\nYou could also role play by putting on merchandise from different houses and enact the naughty moment a Gryffindor gets steamy with someone from Slytherin. Or pop on some Harry Potter porn or even one of the movies from the franchise.\n\nIf you\u2019re more Practical Magic than Potter, have some midnight margaritas instead \u2013 or enact a scene from Hocus Pocus.\n\nMORE: What is \u2018sex brain\u2019?\n\nMORE: How to have feminist sex\n\nMORE: There\u2019s now a special spongy tool to soak up semen after sex\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The scary holiday can also be sexy - here's how to do the Halloween witch sex position, and the Hogwarts version, too.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88831014_1570457356.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
