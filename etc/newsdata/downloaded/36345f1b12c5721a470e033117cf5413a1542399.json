Earlier this month, Target opened 25 new Disney stores inside select Target locations with a \"shop-in-shop\" layout, near its kids clothing and toy section.\n\nLast year, Target added nearly a quarter of a million square feet of new space to its toy business across 500 of its stores, to notch up more toy sales.
