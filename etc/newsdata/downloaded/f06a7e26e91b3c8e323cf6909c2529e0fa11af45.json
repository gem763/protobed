I feel as if I\u2019ve not had a good night\u2019s sleep for years. Is this normal?\n\nThe need to pass water can have a massive impact on sleep as we get older.\n\nFor men this may be prostate-related \u2013 the prostate gland is located just below the bladder, and it\u2019s common for it to grow with advancing years. This can affect how much the bladder can hold, and the ability to hold on.\n\nFor women, bladder changes can be related to the menopause and change in hormones. Also, the pelvic-floor muscles, which support the bladder, weaken with age.\n\n'My wife and I have to get up four or five times a night to pee. I feel as if I\u2019ve not had a good night\u2019s sleep for years. Is this normal?' (stock image)\n\nFor both men and women, overactive bladder syndrome can occur \u2013 when the muscle contracts involuntarily, even when the bladder isn\u2019t full.\n\nWith all these problems, cutting out caffeine can help, as it can cause aggravation.\n\nDrinking a normal quantity of other fluids is important \u2013 about eight glasses a day \u2013 otherwise the urine can be concentrated and even more irritating for the bladder.\n\nDrugs known as anticholinergics, such as oxybutynin or solifenacin, can be prescribed. These temporarily desensitise the bladder nerves, reducing the urge to go.\n\nMy husband suffers with terrible osteoarthritis in his back, knees and hands. He\u2019s 75 and finds it hard even to use cutlery. He\u2019s been given a tablet called naproxen which helps a bit. But is there anything else?\n\nOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It\u2019s likely that, at 75, most people will have it to differing degrees.\n\nThe cartilage which covers and protects the bones in the joints gets damaged and worn with age, weakening muscles and obesity. This causes pain and stiffness but also swelling, particularly of the small joints like the hands.\n\nGPs tend to focus on painkillers for osteoarthritis, such as naproxen or other anti-inflammatories. But that is far from the full picture. Most patients do not get a specialist referral, and there is not a cure for osteoarthritis, but it is possible to get relief and better movement if you explore a range of options.\n\nExercise is important, although patients can be apprehensive because of pain. Specifically muscle-strengthening and range- of-movement exercises ease and improve symptoms. A physiotherapist can advise, but it\u2019s hard to get to see one on the NHS in many areas. The charity Versus Arthritis (versusarthritis.org) is a good resource, with exercises explained and illustrated on its website.\n\nExercising in water can be more comfortable and even soothing.\n\nWeight loss is often recommended. It doesn\u2019t just reduce the strain on the knees and hips \u2013 evidence suggests that even hand arthritis may improve, as being overweight increases levels of chemicals in the body that exacerbate joint pain and swelling.\n\nThere is very little scientific basis for the use of joint pain supplements but many people do find them helpful \u2013 glucosamine, chondroitin and fish oils are worth a go and results can be felt after two to three months.\n\nAnd, as simple as it sounds, ice packs are still one of the best ways to reduce swelling and inflammation. They can be applied for 20 minutes a few times a day. Massage, medical acupuncture and osteopathy are also worth exploring.\n\nTo get the best pain relief from medication, ask your pharmacist about combining naproxen with gels such as heat rubs or adding in paracetamol. The trick with good analgesia is to safely combine through trial and error \u2013 but make sure that you always stick to recommended doses. Privately, injections of hyaluronic acid are offered for knee pain.\n\nHOME-MADE 60p MEALS? YES PLEASE Dust off the Tupperware! The secret to weight loss is organisation Dust off the Tupperware! The secret to weight loss is organisation \u2013 as proved by John Clark, 39, and his partner Charlotte Deniz, 34, who have lost 15 stone between them, not by spending loads of money on fancy superfoods but by batch-cooking each week\u2019s meals for just 60p a dish. Weighing 21st 6 lb at his heaviest, \u2018Fat John\u2019, as he was known, a lorry driver, lived on a diet of burgers, sausage sandwiches and pub lunches. Now he says: \u2018We make absolutely everything from scratch and we eat whatever we want.\u2019 I totally approve. Batch-cooking prep is boring, but having home-made food ready to eat in the freezer stops all of us reaching for the snacks and takeaway menu. You do have to do a lot of cooking and boxing up. But on the occasions I manage to be this organised, it absolutely works for me, particularly with a hungry family during busy weeks. It is also a great way to save money.\n\n\u2018Safe\u2019 painkillers can be dangerous\n\nThere is no such thing as a \u2018safe\u2019 painkiller. I never use the term as all treatments come with risks. Public Health England warned earlier this month that even the \u2018safer\u2019 pain pills gabapentin and pregabalin, also known as gaba drugs, may lead to addiction and withdrawal.\n\nI see patients on them suffering major side-effects and dependence. One-and-a-half million Britons are on them, and they\u2019re often used when other treatments fail. They may help people. But they\u2019re not a quick fix to the opioid crisis \u2013 rather, simply replacing one problem with another.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \u2018safe\u2019 painkiller. I never use the term as all treatments come with risks (stock image)\n\nIt was tragic, but also sadly not surprising, to hear last week that a coroner has linked the deaths of five patients with anorexia to the poor care they received from one NHS trust. I can admit, when I diagnose a patient with anorexia I am always anxious about what will happen next. NHS care for eating disorders is still poor, putting vulnerable lives at risk, as these deaths show. Waiting lists are too long, specialist centres have been decimated and in some areas a patient\u2019s weight has to be dangerously low before any help is offered.
