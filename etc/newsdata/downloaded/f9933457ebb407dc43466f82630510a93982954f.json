It is being released by Juneau-based independent publisher Ice Fog Press in the form of a small run of hand-crafted books.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a niche thing,\u201d Johnson said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like how vinyl has a passionate following still. There\u2019s a passionate, niche audience for photo books. The pie in the sky is that you make something that the passionate photo book lovers love, but that crosses over to the people who don\u2019t necessarily have a collection of photo books but love it for what it is.\u201d\n\nOnly a few hundred copies of the book will be made. Each one will be printed, assembled and sewn together by Johnson and Ice Fog Press founder and editor Ben Huff.\n\nThe pair started putting books together Wednesday, Aug. 21 and were still at it Friday in the hours before a release event for the book.\n\n\u201cThis is much more a labor of love,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe book\u2019s concept is simple - photos of 10 hunting cabins photographed in summer followed by photos of the same cabins in winter. But getting those photos took some time.\n\nThe summer batch was taken in 2010, Johnson said. At the time he was working for Sealaska Environmental Services photographing scientists who were surveying a chemical plume under the tundra near the site of a former Navy base.\n\nWhen he was finished with work and dinner, Johnson would go out and photograph his surroundings. That\u2019s how he wound up at a seasonal Inupiaq hunting camp.\n\n\u201cI have this long fascination with makeshift architecture, and what I loved about the cabins that were there is that each one was unique and made to the design of the person that was making them, so in a way they\u2019re portraits,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSome are humble in their scale and design where other ones are a little more dramatic or ambitious.\u201d\n\nAll the blocky, singular buildings were photographed between the hours of midnight and 3 a.m. while the sun was scraping the horizon, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cI came back, and I really liked the pictures, but it\u2019s just a set of 10 photos,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nIn December 2012, he made a return trip to Utqiagvik with a friend and decided to photograph the same cabins from the exact same perspectives. The stark backdrop of winter and changes to the cabins make the photo sets different in both obvious and subtle ways.\n\nIn the book, the summer photos come before the winter ones, and the collections are broken up by what is effectively a two-page spread the same Arctic Ocean shoreline photographed 18 months apart.\n\nBoth Huff and Johnson said the theme of Johnson\u2019s work and the do-it-yourself nature of \u201cBarrow Cabins\u201d were a match, and the books were tailored to a specific vision.\n\nFor example, the book\u2019s blue-gray cover features an angular die-cut shape that allows a title page\u2019s white to break up the steely color by filling in negative space. The shape is one of the cabins that Johnson had photographed and picking a suitably odd outline was deliberate.\n\n\u201cWe wanted something more enigmatic that looked almost like a building block or a sculpture,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI always thought of these things as sculptural in a sense.\u201d\n\nHuff and Johnson hope people will be able to appreciate those choices in a way that will only be possible with the book.\n\n\u201cAll those little decisions are meant to inform not a single picture but to inform that set of pictures,\u201d Huff said. \u201cand the books is kind of the only way to feel that fully realized vision or version of what that work is and can be. \u201c\n\nWhile Johnson and Huff are excited by that concept, they know not everyone is, and they are content to hope \u201cBarrow Cabins\u201d finds a like-minded audience.\n\n\u201cIf someone else had made this, I would love it, and I would buy it,\u201d Huff said. \u201cbut I know there probably aren\u2019t 5,000 people maybe like me that would see it as part of their world, the way they deal with books.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Eirik Johnson's newest photo book isn't for everyone, and that's partially the point of the project.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ben Hohenstatt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/exchange_boutique_book_51357_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
