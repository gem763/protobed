Over half a century later, he\u2019s passing the baton to a fast-rising Israeli maestro some 53 years his junior.\n\nMaestro Zubin Mehta takes the stage in a series of farewell concerts with the Israeli Philharmonic ending his 50-year tenure with the orchestra in Tel Aviv, Israel October 18, 2019. Picture taken October 18, 2019. REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nThe 83-year-old Indian conductor capped off thousands of performances as music director of the renowned symphony orchestra in a series of farewell concerts in Tel Aviv this week, making way for Lahav Shani, 30, to take the reins.\n\nShani has dazzled audiences for over a decade as both conductor and pianist, building an enviable portfolio of podium appointments in Europe and debasing questions about his youth with his virtuosic musical bravado.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way any conductor could have done all 104 symphonies of Haydn, so there\u2019s lots left for Lahav,\u201d Mehta told Reuters in an interview with the duo, where he gave advice to and talked repertoire with Shani, who becomes music director in 2020.\n\nShani began piano studies while growing up in Tel Aviv, and with Mehta\u2019s encouragement, later expanded his training to orchestral conducting at Berlin\u2019s esteemed Academy of Music Hanns Eisler.\n\n\u201cI (listened) to the orchestra with the maestro (Mehta) many times as a child,\u201d Shani said. \u201cWhen I was a student, I learned from the musicians in the orchestra. They were my teachers for chamber music (and) double bass.\u201d\n\nShani first performed with the 100-member orchestra when he was 18, playing Tchaikovsky\u2019s Piano Concert No. 1. His active schedule as a pianist this season includes performances of Rachmaninov\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 3 with the Staatskapelle Berlin.\n\nHe concurrently serves as chief conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic \u2014 its youngest ever \u2014 and principal guest conductor of the Vienna Symphony.\n\nIsraeli classical music fans celebrate Shani\u2019s appointment but say Mehta\u2019s retirement marks the end of an era.\n\nThe Mumbai-born conductor\u2019s tenure with the ensemble, founded in 1936 as the Palestine Orchestra when the region was under British rule, has spanned much of Israel\u2019s dramatic history since the country\u2019s founding in 1948.\n\nMehta\u2019s storied six-decade career also saw him lead the philharmonic orchestras of New York and Los Angeles and the main opera houses of Munich and Florence.\n\nBut Israel\u2019s orchestra was a mainstay throughout. Mehta says he stayed on as music adviser and director since 1969, in part out of admiration for an Israeli audience that cherishes the arts during times of conflict.\n\nMehta recalled a Tel Aviv performance during the height of a war with Gaza\u2019s Hamas militant group, where rocket sirens forced him to pause the concert.\n\n\u201cTwenty minutes later, we continue. Audience never left,\u201d he said. \u201cIn times of crisis, the audience never stays home.\u201d", "description": "Zubin Mehta was only 25 years old when he first conducted the Israel Philharmonic.
