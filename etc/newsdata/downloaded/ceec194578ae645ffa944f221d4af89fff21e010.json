Several border guards and alleged poachers were hurt and one of the North Koreans later died from his wounds.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nMoscow summoned a North Korean diplomat over the incident.\n\nA regional border official at the Federal Security Service said last week the poachers had resisted because they feared punishment back home for loss of state property over the confiscation of their vessel.\n\nThe countries have had disputes over fishing in the region in the past. Moscow accused Pyongyang in July of illegally detaining one of its fishing vessels. North Korea said the crew had been detained for breaching the rules for entering its territory.", "description": "Russia detained three North Korean vessels and 252 crew on Friday in the second such incident in two weeks as part of a clampdown on poaching by the secretive nation's fishermen.", "authors": ["Tom Balmforth", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434541017&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0XU", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
