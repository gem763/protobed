It\u2019s double punishment,\u201d he told conference attendees.\n\nSome have condemned the speech, including Prime Minister Edouard Philippe who called it \u201cnauseating\u201d and \u201cprofoundly contrary to the idea we have of France and the Republic\u201d. However, others on the right have voiced support for Zemmour.\n\nGilbert Collard, MP for the populist National Rally, wrote: \u201cOne may not agree with Zemmour, but must he suffer the unjust tyranny of prosecution, censorship, prosecutors, and verbal straight jackets? No!\u201d\n\nMayor of B\u00e9ziers Robert M\u00e9nard also came out in favour of the philosopher and stated: \u201cI know Eric Zemmour well. He speaks harshly, but he is absolutely not racist. If we condemn Zemmour, we condemn freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nMarion Marechal Calls for French to Resist \u2018Great Replacement\u2019 https://t.co/e5lwcWlJup \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 1, 2019\n\nM\u00e9nard is no stranger to hate speech prosecutions. In 2017, he was fined 2,000 euros for comments regarding the shifting demographics in B\u00e9ziers\u2019 schools, having said: \u201cIn a class in the city centre of my town, 91 per cent of the children are Muslims. Obviously, this is a problem. There are limits to tolerance.\u201d\n\nFellow philosopher Michel Onfray, who recently made headlines for labelling climate activist teen Greta Thunberg a \u201cSwedish cyborg\u201c, said there were double standards on enforcing speech offences.\n\n\u201cIndeed, if we do not have the right to make this kind of comment and then we must expand to all other things that praise tyrants, dictators, bastards etc.,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI can not be an intellectual who says \u2018let us complain about people who do not think like us,'\u201d he added.\n\nThe conference also saw Marion Mar\u00e9chal, niece of National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, call for those on the right in France to resist the Great Replacement, a theory used to describe rapid demographic shifts due to mass migration.", "description": "French authorities have launched an investigation into philosopher Eric Zemmour over a speech on Islam made at a right-wing convention.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1171631582-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
