I quickly worked out at Norwich (3-1 defeat in August) that we didn't have the players with the capability to play the way I'd envisaged.\n\n'In the Premier League you've got to be big and physical and have the ability to run. Unfortunately that is one thing here now, from the back to my midfield, we haven't got.\n\n'And, ultimately, until we've got that, we're going to have to play in a certain way and the identity will be to sit deep and play on the counter-attack, because that is the only way we can play.\n\nBruce played three at the back in Newcastle's 1-0 win over Spurs earlier this season\n\n'That certain way has been drilled into them (by Benitez). We have to start with that again.'\n\nBruce, meanwhile, does not like some of the criticism regarding his team's lack of identity and has taken it personally.\n\n'I'd like to think, after 400 games as a Premier League manager, that it's an insult to me that I just say to them, \"Go on, get on with it\",' he added. 'It's an insult to the two coaches I have who work repeatedly on the tactical side.\n\n'Mud has been thrown my way since I walked through the door. You don't get the time anymore. You can't think you're going to get two or three years to change things round, you have to work with what you've got and try to find a few results.'", "description": "Bruce's only win - 1-0 at Spurs in August - came when he used that system but he has since changed approach and his players were not comfortable when he lined up with a back four.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/18/19308646-0-image-a-11_1570210833690.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
