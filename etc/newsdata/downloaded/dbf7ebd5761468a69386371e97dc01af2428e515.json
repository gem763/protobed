Long before hipsters took over the \u201cCity of Roses,\u201d it was one of the most dangerous port towns in the country, with a brutal kidnapping epidemic that led to the nickname \u201cForbidden City of the West.\u201d\n\nFor nearly 100 years\u2014between the mid-1800s, past Prohibition, and up into the 1940s\u2014an illicit flesh market funneled reportedly thousands of men and women to Pacific-bound ships to serve as crew members and prostitutes.\n\nWidely-shared tales of \u201cshanghaiing\u201d tell of drunken patrons falling through trapped doors in seedy bars to wake up enslaved as seamen; men lured by prostitutes into underground holding cells where they\u2019d remain until being sold to the next ship that docked in town; and women drugged and kept in solitary cells underground in conditions meant to break their will.
