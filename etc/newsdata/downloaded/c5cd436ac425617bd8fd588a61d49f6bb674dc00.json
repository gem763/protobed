Oh, and the time he admitted on George Stephanopoulos\u2019s show that, sure, it\u2019s possible that Cohen might have paid hush money to other former Trump mistresses if circumstances required it.\n\nWas that Rudy being strategic, revealing a bit damning information as if it\u2019s no big deal in the expectation that the info would leak eventually anyway?\n\nOr was that Rudy being Rudy, one of the most erratic and undisciplined guests on all of cable news? His loose lips in front of the camera have reportedly earned the president\u2019s anger before, remember.\n\nThe line from Trump and his aides thus far has been that he did indeed raise the Biden investigation with Ukraine\u2019s president on July 25 but that he never threatened to withhold the $250 million in military aid that had been pledged to Ukraine. Right, said Rudy to Maria Bartiromo earlier today, Trump never threatened that. One hundred percent certainty, Bartiromo replied? Welllllll, said Rudy\u2026\n\nSome critics insist that Trump should be impeached for what he said to Zelensky if he never brought up the military aid. You don\u2019t need to reach the question of whether extortion occurred, they maintain; as soon as Trump tried to enlist a foreign government into making trouble for his probable opponent in next year\u2019s election, that was impeachment-worthy.\n\nOkay, but extortion on top of that would make the abuse of power that much more vivid and objectionable. And Trump and Rudy know it, which is why they\u2019re so keen to emphasize that no threat was made. I think they\u2019re probably telling the truth too, since there was no need for Trump to explicitly threaten Zelensky. It would have been clear enough to the Ukrainian after the aid had been delayed what the likely consequences would be if he flatly refused Trump\u2019s request on Biden. Same goes for Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, who delivered a speech this weekend in which claiming there was no pressure from Trump or his administration related to the military aid. Put yourself in his shoes: His country will be dealing with the Trump White House for another 14 months at a minimum and possibly until early 2025. They know that Trump wants better relations with Russia and that they\u2019re a prime obstacle standing in his way. If Trump did pressure Zelensky, would the minister dare admit it and risk making an embittered enemy of the president? How might Russia react if American patronage of Ukraine were suddenly completely cut off?\n\nThe stakes in alienating the U.S. government don\u2019t need to be spelled out to the Ukrainians. Even if there were no military aid involved in this, there\u2019d still be loads of \u201cpressure\u201d to comply with Trump\u2019s request.\n\nThe X factor in the Ukraine matter is whether the Bidens really are guilty of impropriety or not. Right, right, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, but Trump\u2019s defense that he was only interested in getting Ukraine to fight corruption will be more persuasive to Americans the more evidence there is that the Bidens really were corrupt. There\u2019s certainly an appearance of impropriety: What the hell was Hunter Biden doing on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, and why would Joe Biden agree to be a liaison to the Ukrainian government on the subject of corruption knowing that his son had business interests there? It looks terrible. As to whether there was actual corruption, with Biden pressuring the Ukrainians not to investigate his son\u2019s company, that\u2019s harder to answer. Starting with the fact that there\u2019s no one left who\u2019s sufficiently trusted by both sides to answer it definitively:\n\nLet me confess something that bothers me \u2014 I don't trust the media to get the Trump-Ukraine story right. But I also don't trust conservative media outlets to do anything other than provide spin. \u2014 Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) September 23, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s unimaginable that a partisan right-wing outlet would investigate and conclude that Biden\u2019s intentions were pure, but it\u2019s also unimaginable that big media would put the brakes on a Democratic impeachment train that\u2019s just about to reach runaway speed over this scandal by pronouncing Biden guilty of corrupt interference in the Ukrainian justice process. Even if they did, lefties would retort that Biden\u2019s misdeeds are no excuse for Trump\u2019s abuse of power, merely a reason to disqualify Biden in the Democratic primary. But \u201cBiden guilty!\u201d would be a bad headline for Dems when they\u2019re trying to convince people that Trump is the guilty one.\n\nEd did a nice job this morning making the case that there\u2019s a conflict of interest and that Joe Biden should have been more sensitive to it. But as to the big question of whether Biden really was trying to get the Ukrainians to back off of his son\u2019s business, Burisma Holdings, that\u2019s dicier. By the time Joe started twisting Ukraine\u2019s arm to fire the lead prosecutor, the probe into Burisma had already gone dormant. People who follow Ukrainian politics insist that the prosecutor really was corrupt, too. In other words, this wasn\u2019t a case of Joe leaping into the political fray in Ukraine to block an investigation by an idealistic D.A. that was on the brink of exposing Hunter Biden\u2019s corruption. This was Biden leaning on Ukraine to fire a guy who needed firing and who had declined to aggressively pursue Burisma, for whatever reason.\n\nBut maybe there\u2019s more to it? Which brings us back to Erickson\u2019s point: Whom do you trust to find out?\n\nHere\u2019s Trump this afternoon at the UN addressing the Ukraine matter briefly \u2014 but significantly, for two reasons. One: He himself connects U.S. aid to Ukraine to his conversation with Zelensky. Why would we give money to a country that\u2019s not fighting corruption, he wonders? But the whole point Giuliani\u2019s been trying to make is that money, i.e. the $250 million, wasn\u2019t part of Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Now here\u2019s Trump hinting that it was part of his calculation in raising the Biden matter. Two: How often does Trump press foreign leaders on the subject of domestic corruption? Has he ever once brought up Russia\u2019s kleptocracy in his chats with Putin? Has he brought up corruption in conversations with the leaders of other U.S. client states, like Saudi Arabia or Egypt? This should be an easy question for the White House to answer. Go through the transcripts of his calls with heads of state and count up how many times he\u2019s confronted them about their corrupt administration of justice back home. If he really is bringing it up often with foreign officials then his conversation with Zelensky will look more innocent. If the only time he\u2019s ever brought it up is in his conversation with Zelensky then that\u2019s strong evidence that it\u2019s not corruption that Trump cares about, it\u2019s making trouble for Joe Biden specifically.", "description": "\"Well, I can't tell you if it's 100% percent.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/rg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
