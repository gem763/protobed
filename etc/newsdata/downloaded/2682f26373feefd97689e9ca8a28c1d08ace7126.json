It\u2019s not about what others think about them.\u201d\n\nIn this Sunday, Aug. 11, 2019, photo an iPhone displays the apps for Facebook and Messenger in New Orleans.

But that was not a surprise to me,\u201d Flory says. \u201cOn the flip side, over 80% talk about how creativity is a positive outlet for them, and something that adds value to their mental health.\u201d\n\nFlory said what surprised him most wasn\u2019t that Gen-Z is hyperaware of their mental health in the digital age \u2013 but that they prioritize it.\n\n\u201c55% [of respondents] talked about how they\u2019re so aware of the mental health issues that are surrounding them with social media, that they\u2019re carving out time in their daily routine to invest in creativity in order to protect and improve their mental health,\u201d says Flory. \u201cI think they are keenly aware of the impact, and how to operate and navigate, this landscape of social media. They are looking at it from a social operating system, in which they\u2019re using it for themselves and how to better their lives \u2013 I think a lot of good can come from that.\u201d\n\nVSCO\u2019s filters are frequently used to manipulate images that users then post to Instagram; but Flory doesn\u2019t draw comparisons between VSCO as a business and Instagram. Their missions, he says, are entirely different.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, VSCO\u2019s business has been about building a product that people are willing to pay for, direct-to-consumer,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe difference is that we\u2019re in the business of selling an experience that you\u2019re willing to pay for, use, and continue to pay for, and for us, that business model alignment to mission and vision and values is so critical.\u201d\n\nOlivia Balsamo is a writer and producer at Yahoo Finance.
