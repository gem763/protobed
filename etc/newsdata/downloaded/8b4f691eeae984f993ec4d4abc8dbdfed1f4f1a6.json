Trump\u2019s lawyer distanced the president from Mulvaney\u2019s account. The Justice Department said the explanation was news to them. And Democrats cast Mulvaney\u2019s remarks as further evidence wrongdoing as Trump sought a \u201cfavor\u201d from Ukraine.\n\nTrump, traveling in Texas, appeared to stand by his top aide, calling Mulvaney a \u201cgood man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a lot of confidence\u201d in him, Trump said.\n\nBut Mulvaney\u2019s initial remarks, made during a rare appearance by an administration official in the White House briefing room, spun open a new phase of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHe indicated that a quid pro quo was at play for the military aid \u2014 but a different one than Democrats initially highlighted as they probed Trump\u2019s efforts to have Ukraine investigate a company linked to the son of his Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nTrump, as shown in a rough transcript of the July call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sought help in investigating not only the firm tied to Biden, but also a security company hired by the DNC that discovered that Russian agents had broken into the committee\u2019s network. The stolen emails were subsequently published by WikiLeaks ahead of the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters, delivering the White House\u2019s most granular explanation yet of the decision to withhold military assistance.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that,\u201d Mulvaney continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Jay Sekulow issued a pointed statement distancing the president\u2019s legal team from Mulvaney\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing,\u201d it said.\n\nWithin hours, Mulvaney issued a separate statement claiming his remarks were misconstrued.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\u201d\n\nBut it may be difficult to erase what Mulvaney said as House Democrats dig into their investigation.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee leading the impeachment probe, said, \u201cI think Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.\u201d\n\nMulvaney, who has already received a subpoena for documents in the impeachment probe, will now likely be asked by investigators to appear for a deposition.\n\n\u201cI believe that they\u2019re getting closer to basically admitting a crime,\u201d said Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who said Mulvaney should testify. \u201cWhere he talks about politics being attached to foreign policy. I mean, you\u2019re going up to the water\u2019s edge there.\u201d\n\nMulvaney during the press briefing defended Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine by casting it as part of an ongoing Justice Department investigation looking into the origins of the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\nHe said the investigation was one of several reasons Trump held up nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, including a desire for European nations to increase their own assistance to Kyiv. Funding was eventually released.\n\nA senior official at the Justice Department said if the White House was withholding aid in regard to cooperation with any investigation at the department, it was news to them. The official was not unauthorized to discuss the situation and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump\u2019s request to Ukraine for an investigation into the 2016 election appears linked to unfounded conspiracy theories about a Ukraine link to the DNC hack that began circulating almost immediately after the breach was discovered. Some were propagated in stories online and by Russian media and included mention of a supposed \u201chidden DNC server,\u201d which acolytes of the Republican political operative Roger Stone picked up and circulated.\n\nThe sudden development punctuated another fast-moving day in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nLawmakers met for hours behind closed doors with the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who testified that he disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision to have envoys work with the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine policy, rather than through traditional government channels.\n\nThe ambassador was the latest in a series of witnesses, many of them career State Department and foreign policy officials, providing new and detailed concerns about Trump and Giuliani and their attempts to influence Ukraine.\n\nSondland\u2019s attempt to stand apart from Trump is remarkable since, unlike other career civil servants, he is a hand-picked political appointee of the president who contributed $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nMulvaney defended Trump\u2019s decision to tap Giuliani to help lead Ukraine policy, saying it was the president\u2019s prerogative.\n\n\u201cYou may not like the fact that Giuliani was involved,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal, it\u2019s not impeachable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president gets to set foreign policy, and he gets to choose who to do so, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate any law,\u201d Mulvaney added.\n\nAs for complaints about mixing politics with foreign policy, Mulvaney had a blunt rejoinder: \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nDemocrats plodding their way through hours of witness testimony during a week of closed-door hearings said Mulvaney\u2019s admissions were game-changing in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Mulvaney \u201cco-signed the president\u2019s confession.\u201d", "description": "Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said that Trump did nothing wrong in linking the aid to Ukraine\u2019s investigation, then backtracks comments.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GP019_mickmu_ZG_20180827124205.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
