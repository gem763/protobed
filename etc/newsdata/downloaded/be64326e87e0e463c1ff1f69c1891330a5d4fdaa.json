Strap them on while you eat, sleep, walk and repeat and they\u2019ll seamlessly track your activities \u2014 from step counters to sleep quality \u2014 all while making a stylish statement.\n\nTech expert Steve Sammartino tells news.com.au that Apple and Samsung are the better brands to opt for.\n\n\u201cThey have the advantage of seamlessly interacting with your other devices, so you get a better read,\u201d he said.\n\nConsider some of these recent models to find one that matches your budget as well as your style.\n\nRELATED: Kids getting active with new tech\n\nRELATED: \u2018My Fitbit made me fat\u2019\n\nFITBIT CHARGE 3\n\nPrice: $229.95\n\nSteve\u2019s rating: 6/10\n\nThe Fitbit Charge 3 is most people\u2019s go-to when shopping for a fitness wearable. Widely considered to be the most complete fitness tracker on the market, it\u2019s one of the simplest to use and has proven accurate when measuring the wearer\u2019s steps and heart rate. The most obvious downside? Price point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expensive compared to other competitors that are not smart watches,\u201d says Steve. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot like a smartwatch, so as a consumer I reckon you\u2019re better off with a smartwatch!\u201d\n\nPros:\n\n\u2022 Waterproof up to 50 metres (pool and ocean)\n\n\u2022 Up to seven days battery life\n\n\u2022 Light design\n\n\u2022 Big screen\n\n\u2022 Heart rate tracking\n\n\u2022 Sleep monitoring (even naps)\n\n\u2022 Can view smartphone notifications\n\n\u2022 Responds to notifications (Android only)\n\n\u2022 Fitbit Pay support (special edition only)\n\n\u2022 Works with iOS and Android (Windows coming soon)\n\n\u2022 Interchangeable straps\n\n\u2022 Can auto-recognise certain activities if they are more than 10 minutes\n\nCons:\n\n\u2022 No GPS tracks your workout by tapping into the signal on your phone\n\n\u2022 Not a colour screen\n\n\u2022 Expensive\n\nGARMIN VIVOSMART 4\n\nPrice: $199\n\nSteve\u2019s rating: 7/10\n\nThe Garmin V\u00edvosmart 4 offers fitness tracking in a small package. Its itsy-bitsy touch screen is still functional but can be a touch more difficult to use. Its slimmer, sleeker design is well suited to an avid gym-goer but not recommended for serious athletes. One of its key features \u2014 the Body Battery metric \u2014 does a solid job of estimating how much juice you have in the tank or whether you may need to rest.\n\nIts also comes in two sizes: small/medium (designed to fit wrists with a circumference of 122-188mm) and a large option (for those with a wrist circumference of 148-215mm).\n\nSteve recommends this one for more \u201ccasual users\u201d.\n\nPros:\n\n\u2022 Slim design\n\n\u2022 Long-lasting battery\n\n\u2022 Rep counting for gym exercises\n\n\u2022 Heart rate monitor\n\n\u2022 Step tracking\n\n\u2022 VO2 Max testing (great for those HIIT and Crossfit classes)\n\n\u2022 iOS and Android support\n\n\u2022 All day stress tracking (comes with an optional \u2018Relax Reminder\u2019)\n\n\u2022 Body Battery metric (energy monitoring)\n\n\u2022 Pulse Ox sensor (estimates blood oxygen saturation)\n\nCons:\n\n\u2022 Very small touchscreen\n\n\u2022 No GPS\n\n\u2022 Waterproof but touchscreen doesn\u2019t work in water\n\n\u2022 Fixed strap (can\u2019t swap colours)\n\n\u2022 Mileage tracker and accelerometer are not as accurate as competitors\n\nAPPLE WATCH SERIES 5\n\nPrice: From $649\n\nSteve\u2019s rating: 8/10\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 is at the pricier end of smartwatches. While it doesn\u2019t differ hugely from its previous generation \u2014 the Series 4 \u2014 there are a few key changes. The latest release has an always-on retina display (which can be disabled if you like), which means you see the time without having to move your wrist.\n\nWhile Apple didn\u2019t release the Series 5 with a native sleep tracking feature, an accidentally released screenshot for Apple Watch Alarms shows a sleep feature that perhaps hasn\u2019t launched yet. It\u2019s unclear whether that feature will be debuted or what effect it will have on the device\u2019s already lesser battery life.\n\nWhile it\u2019s designed to be a smartwatch, it also includes basic fitness tracking capabilities making it a perfect choice for those who want an activity tracker that can also do other things.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to check your phone to read messages, you can check your watch \u2014 which is great for workers who may not be able to access their messages easily,\u201d Steve explains.\n\nYou can even make calls from the watch itself! \u201cI rate it as the best smartwatch on the market,\u201d says Steve.\n\nPros:\n\n\u2022 Improved heart rate sensor tech\n\n\u2022 Titanium case option (exclusive to Series 5)\n\n\u2022 Mapping support (including a compass)\n\n\u2022 Increased storage (32GB) for apps and music\n\n\u2022 Fall detection\n\n\u2022 Water resistant (up to 50m)\n\n\u2022 International emergency calling enabled\n\n\u2022 Old bands work on the new model\n\nCons:\n\n\u2022 Pricey\n\n\u2022 Apple warns certain bands can affect accuracy\n\n\u2022 Shorter battery life than competitors (an average of 18 hours)\n\n\u2022 Can only track sleep through third party app\n\n\u2022 Only compatible with iOS devices\n\nSAMSUNG GALAXY WATCH ACTIVE\n\nPrice: $349\n\nSteve\u2019s Rating: 8/10\n\nTo most people, the Galaxy Watch Active looks like Samsung created an Apple Watch alternative for Android users at a cheaper price point. But the difference between them is obvious to users. Apple\u2019s Smart Watch acts more like a \u201cSwiss Army knife iPhone on your wrist\u201d, explains Steve, whereas the Galaxy Watch Active is much more health focused.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much wasted if you treat it like a basic tracker. When you manually start a tracked exercise it records everything from pace, heart rate and distance to calories.\n\nAnd when it comes to the gym, it matches your pace. \u201cIt\u2019s very good at tracking small movements like arm curls in a gym,\u201d says Steve. \u201cNothing is too inconsequential for it to measure.\u201d\n\nPros:\n\n\u2022 Sleek yet subtle design (looks more like a watch)\n\n\u2022 Waterproof\n\n\u2022 Interchangeable straps\n\n\u2022 Very bright screen\n\n\u2022 Built-in GPS\n\n\u2022 Heart rate sensor\n\n\u2022 Can store a small amount of music on it\n\n\u2022 Includes NFC chip to allow for payments processing\n\n\u2022 Supports most of the fitness apps like RunKeeper and Strava\n\nCons:\n\n\u2022 Missing Samsung\u2019s trademark rotating bezel (without it, it can be difficult to navigate)\n\n\u2022 Longer charging time\n\n\u2022 Short battery life in comparison to others (two days average)", "description": "When it comes to wearables, we\u2019re not just talking about your gramp\u2019s watch anymore.", "authors": ["Adrianna Zappavigna"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6720d3d26b45ae6b65d61976a4d7a955?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
