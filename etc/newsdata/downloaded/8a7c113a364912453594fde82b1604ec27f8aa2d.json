That was a victory for French President Emmanuel Macron, who had blocked the path of the two would-be members, even though most EU leaders took the opposite view.\n\nThe Czech leader's point was a simple one: The EU had promised both countries that they would be invited to begin membership talks if they met certain conditions. In the case of North Macedonia, that included settling a decades-old dispute with Greece; for Albania, it involved rooting out corrupt judges. The European Commission judged that both Skopje and Tirana had kept their word. But, in the eyes of most of its own leaders, the EU itself did not.\n\n\"Let me be very clear: North Macedonia and Albania are not to blame for this,\" European Council President Donald Tusk said. \"I would like to send a message to our Macedonian and Albanian friends: Please do not give up. I fully understand your frustration, because you did your share and we haven't.\"\n\nIn the end, the only thing leaders could agree unanimously on the issue was a single sentence: \"The European Council will revert to the issue of enlargement before the EU-Western Balkans summit in Zagreb in May 2020.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker branded the EU's rebuff to the two countries \"a grave historic mistake.\" Juncker repeated the phrase to make his point and, possibly not by accident, delivered his message in French.\n\nFor supporters of talks with the two countries, the stalemate in Brussels could have serious repercussions in one of the most volatile parts of the Continent, the scene of a series of interlinked wars just two decades ago. Diplomats have noted that the European Union often portrays itself as a peace project above all, yet now seems reluctant to use a tool meant to cement peace in the Balkans \u2014 the prospect of EU membership to encourage good neighborly relations and democratic reforms.\n\nHowever, Macron disputed many of the arguments used by advocates of EU enlargement. At his end-of-summit press conference, he argued the entire process needed reform before any further countries could begin the years-long accession journey and that the EU also needed to overhaul unwieldy decision-making structures to accommodate new members.\n\nIn the end, the only thing leaders could agree unanimously on the issue was a single sentence: \"The European Council will revert to the issue of enlargement before the EU-Western Balkans summit in Zagreb in May 2020.\"\n\nParis has been at the center of successful efforts to resist opening talks with North Macedonia and Albania on three separate occasions going back 16 months.\n\nThat outcome was particularly galling for the government in North Macedonia, which was first recommended for membership talks by the Commission 10 years ago.\n\n\"The least that the European Union owes the region is to be straightforward with us. If there is no more consensus on the European future of the Western Balkans ... the citizens deserve to know,\" North Macedonia's Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov tweeted.\n\nFor years, when the country was called Macedonia, its path was blocked by Greece, which said the name implied unjustified claims on Greek territory and cultural heritage. After a new government came to power in Skopje, the country struck a deal with Athens that included changing its name. But with Greek objections finally overcome, the country found itself blocked, above all, by another single member state \u2014 France.\n\nParis has been at the center of successful efforts to resist opening talks with North Macedonia and Albania on three separate occasions going back 16 months.\n\nFrench officials have bristled at assertions that Paris has been isolated on the issue. But diplomats say even those few countries that offered limited support to France \u2014 such as the Netherlands and Denmark \u2014 would likely not have held out if Paris, one of the bloc's diplomatic heavyweights, had dropped its opposition to talks, at least with North Macedonia.\n\nIn Thursday night's debate among the EU's 28 leaders, 25 countries could have accepted launching membership talks with both North Macedonia and Albania, according to a diplomat familiar with the discussion. Germany was among those countries backing the start of talks for both countries but could not persuade France to shift.\n\nThe debate was a \u201cvery, very bad-tempered discussion\u201d with many leaders \"piling up\" on Macron, said another EU diplomat briefed on the meeting.\n\nThe subject was deeply personal for some of the leaders, including those from Central and Eastern Europe whose own countries went through the accession process to become EU members.\n\nSome leaders recalled their accession experience, warned of damage to the EU's credibility if talks were not launched and stressed that rival powers in the Balkans such as China, Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia would benefit, according to the first diplomat.\n\nThe feeling around the table was that North Macedonia was at a more advanced stage than Albania, but five or six member states did not want to agree to opening talks with just one of the two candidates, the diplomat said.\n\nAt one point, Macron sat on a sofa with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and tried to draft a text with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, stating that the Council would reach a decision by May 2020. Yet, after various attempts to improve the text, that effort failed.\n\nAn Elys\u00e9e Palace official said there had been \"a counterproductive and unwelcome strategy of putting pressure on France and the Netherlands \u2014 thinking that in tabling the issue on the agenda of the European Council, the positions might change.\u201d\n\nThe official complained that this \"game of pressure\" consisted of saying that those who favored the start of talks had strategic vision and those who did not lacked such vision.\n\nWhen exactly the EU will try again to find consensus on the issue remains unclear.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said his country would propose giving it another try at a meeting of the EU's General Affairs Council next month.\n\nSome expect the issue to be on the agenda of the next regular European Council in December. Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister who will take over from Tusk as Council president on December 1, agreed to that idea, one of the diplomats said.\n\nBut both those events could come too soon to carry a realistic prospect any change. Some diplomats say much of Macron's resistance is linked to fears that the topic could be exploited by the far right and expect France's position could soften after local elections in March next year.\n\nOne diplomat expressed doubts that France's stance would shift as long as Paris keeps focusing on calls for changes in EU processes \u2014 which generally take a very long time to implement \u2014 rather than on the record of the candidate countries.\n\nIf France continues to take that line, the diplomat argued, North Macedonia and Albania \"could turn into Switzerland\" and still not get the green light for talks, the diplomat said.\n\nAndrew Gray and Rym Momtaz contributed reporting.", "description": "Macron\u2019s rejection of membership talks for North Macedonia and Albania angers other top officials.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1153223486-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
