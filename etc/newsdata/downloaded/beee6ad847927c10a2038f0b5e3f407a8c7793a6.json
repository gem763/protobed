For decades, the 55-year-old Darby has been a reliable source of insight for global investors, having worked previously as a strategist at Nomura and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, and before that as an investment manager himself. We checked in with Darby about what life might look like after the European Central Bank\u2019s launch of a major stimulus package and the political protests in Hong Kong. To learn the answers to these questions and why China and the U.S. are more alike than you think, read the following edited excerpts.\n\nBarron\u2019s: What do you think of the ECB\u2019s latest package to boost growth?\n\nDarby: It didn\u2019t disappoint investors. It duly delivered a deposit rate cut of 0.1% and restarted its bond purchase program at 20 billion euros [$22.1 billon] a month. In many ways, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have the same problem\u2014they\u2019ve used unconventional policies and never really exited the initial quantitative easing programs. Indeed, Japan introduced a super-yield-curve control program, as well. When they do engage in policy shifts, they have an eye on keeping their currencies weak as part of the reflation strategy.\n\nEuropean authorities are looking to expand the fiscal side. Europe gets unfair treatment from investors, even though virtually all of the European countries outside of France and Greece run current account surpluses, so they have big savings surpluses. Borrowing costs are rock-bottom, and governments are far richer than they\u2019ve been in the past 10 years.\n\nWhen people voted in European elections earlier this year, one of the most important issues was climate. Green tech industries are a very positive way of providing a populist uplift with potentially very big multipliers for the European economy.\n\nNow that Hong Kong CEO Carrie Lam yanked the controversial extradition bill, does that put an end to the protests?\n\nIt was the major focus of the anger, so for a lot of people, it\u2019s the end of the problem. But the other demands, such as investigating the police response [as well as amnesty for the protestors and direct elections for all lawmakers] are unlikely to be answered. I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s the political will to deal with it. Authorities, both in Hong Kong and China, will look to appease the protesters by applying some populist measures. They will look to cool the property prices in Hong Kong.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a signal to buy Hong Kong assets, I take it.\n\nCorrect. Hong Kong was fortunate because while retail sales, tourism, and hotel numbers were impacted quickly by the protest movement, the financial system was extremely robust, and the U.S. Federal Reserve was on an easing path. So rates remained relatively subdued. Bear in mind that when the handover occurred in 1997, Hong Kong\u2019s gross domestic product accounted for 18% or 19% of China\u2019s GDP. Today, it\u2019s probably no more than 3%. Over the past 10 years, authorities have made an enormous effort to build what\u2019s termed the Greater Bay Area, an infrastructure linking Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Macau. That\u2019s what the Chinese authorities are really interested in. They were keen to ensure that Shenzhen was given the opportunity to have the same sort of role as Hong Kong. The effect of the protests was relatively small there, because a lot of these other companies just aren\u2019t influenced by Hong Kong macro data, but by what\u2019s happening on the mainland.\n\nHas China lost face in this encounter?\n\nThere\u2019s no easy answer. The Hong Kong legislature was unpopular for other decisions outside the extradition bill, including heavy-handed new policies relating to land development and reclamation projects. There are two deadlines for China in terms of the resolution of this protest. First, and most imminent: On Oct. 1, China celebrates the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic. Chinese authorities would not want to be embarrassed by any external protest.\n\n\u201c \u201cA very Western, consumption-led type of stimulus is being introduced [in China].\u201d \u201d \u2014Sean Darby\n\nAnd in 2021, President Xi Jinping and China celebrate the centenary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. While President Donald Trump is doing his utmost to ease and make sure the U.S. economy is really juiced up for 2020, Xi Jinping has to have the same occur with China\u2019s economy in 2021.\n\nEconomists are downgrading Chinese growth forecasts because of the trade war.\n\nThere are clearly defined political dates by which they need the economy to be rosy. People argue that the Fed made a policy mistake by raising interest rates in December. China also made a policy error by introducing draconian tightening measures for the banks to address wealth management products and account for bad loans. And in May and June of last year, China experienced a credit crunch\u2014coincidentally, that was when the trade dispute began escalating. So China has two parallel problems: trade, and it over-tightened. The Chinese authorities do need to put a floor under the economy, because employment conditions have been deteriorating for almost a year. Like the Fed, the People\u2019s Bank of China is very sensitive to unemployment numbers and job growth.\n\nWhat kind of growth-revival plan should we expect from China?\n\nAgain, there are quite interesting similarities with the U.S. Last year, instead of doing the normal fiscal pump-priming or infrastructure spending, the Chinese authorities did a large-scale overhaul of personal taxation rates, centered on lower-income households. Recently, it did interest-rate reform that essentially pushes the banks to bring down lending rates to be more in line with the rates at which they borrow from the central bank. That would lower refinancing costs for small and medium-size enterprises, and also bring down mortgage rates. Very recently, the Chinese authorities again announced that they will review tax packages. A very Western, consumption-led type of stimulus is being introduced. And, as in the U.S., China has been trying to bring down long-term rates.\n\nWhere are we in the global cycle?\n\nThere are a lot of similarities between what\u2019s happening today and what we experienced in the late 1990s. Back then, central banks were just getting accustomed to low inflation rates. Today, they\u2019re worried about deflation. The U.S. today, like in the \u201990s, was the major focus of global growth. The late \u201990s spawned the growth of the internet and digitalization. Today, we have a very big sea change in the frontier of technology applications, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrencies. And back then, the Fed eased only to take rates back up again. That could happen in this cycle. The yield curve in the U.S. is not fully inverted. It\u2019s kinked around the five-year duration, and onward it starts to steepen. This is the scenario we\u2019re using for clients.\n\nWhat are you advising?\n\nThat there are some pretty good, healthy growth stories. One is sporting events in Japan. There\u2019s the upcoming Japan Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Generally, events of that magnitude produce decent returns for companies involved in the branding of sports goods. Investors haven\u2019t focused on it. Our basket includes advertising and PR company Hakuhodo DY Holdings [ticker: 2433.Japan], sporting-goods company Mizuno [8022.Japan], tourism and leisure company H.I.S. [9603.Japan], and Meiji Holdings [2269.Japan], which produces nutrition bars.\n\nGreen tech is an easy win for politicians, particularly in Europe. Our basket includes energy company E.ON [EOAN.Germany], wind-turbine company Nordex [NDX1.Germany], and GEA Group [G1A.Germany].\n\nWhat other themes do you like?\n\nThe degree of risk aversion in the financial markets is quite unwarranted, given that we have easing, and global growth is forecast to come in at 3.2% this year, by no means a disaster. We\u2019re not seeing evidence of big waves of deflation. Wages are holding up pretty well globally. The Fed has been cutting short rates, and long rates have come down so far that mortgage refinancing will really kick in. You know, 50% of 30-year mortgages in the U.S. will be up for refinancing at these levels. I\u2019d be bullish on U.S. home-refurbishment companies like Home Depot [HD] and home builders like D.R. Horton [DHI]. We also have a crane, digger, and excavator theme: Companies like Caterpillar [CAT], Hitachi Construction Machinery [6305.Japan], and Komatsu [6301.Japan] tend to benefit when U.S. rates are cut, because it feeds through to the emerging markets, which are all starting to cut rates, too.\n\nWhat do you see differently as a strategist, given that you sit physically in Hong Kong?\n\nA few weeks ago, I looked up, and the PBOC had just announced it was shortly going to publish its work on developing a digital currency, the e-yuan. What amazed me is that China\u2019s financial system, in many ways, is still behind that of the West\u2014but its big leap in developing a digital currency puts it far ahead of the Fed and other countries. For the past 50 years, the U.S.\u2019s big advantages included the dollar and its economic scale. Well, China can scale four times more than the U.S. and is only just now trying to bring its currency into the mainstream. A new economic bloc is being created, scaling things to unimaginable levels.\n\nThanks, Sean. \u2022", "description": "China needs to shore up its economy and stabilize its markets ahead of a series of important anniversaries.
