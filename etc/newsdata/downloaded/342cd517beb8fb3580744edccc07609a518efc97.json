(AP) - Michigan linebacker Josh Uche recalls being excited when he saw the second half of this season\u2019s schedule.\n\nThe 16th-ranked Wolverines (5-1, 3-1 Big Ten) kick off a tough closing stretch of games at No. 7 Penn State (6-0, 3-0) on Saturday night.\n\nThey host No. 8 Notre Dame next week in the Big House under the lights and close the regular season against rival and fourth-ranked Ohio State at home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s big time now,\u201d Uche said Monday. \u201cPrime-time television. We have a chance to be legendary.\n\n\u201cWe just got to do our jobs, execute and the rest will take care of itself.\u201d\n\nThat will not be easy.\n\nThe Nittany Lions are favored to win by more than a touchdown, perhaps in part because Jim Harbaugh is 1-6 against ranked teams on the road over five seasons as Michigan\u2019s coach.\n\nMichigan was embarrassed the last time it had a chance to beat a Top 25 team away from home, giving up five straight touchdowns before losing to Wisconsin 35-14 last month. Badgers running back Jonathan Taylor ran for 203 yards and two touchdowns, finding huge holes behind a line that was pushing the Wolverines around.\n\n\u201cYou guys were saying we can\u2019t stop the run and we\u2019re soft,\u201d Uche told reporters. \u201cWe kind of framed that in our minds and that\u2019s given us a lot of motivation to work hard. That underdog mentality has given us a new flame.\u201d\n\nBesides ranked opponents remaining on the schedule, Michigan also has matchups looming against rival and upset-minded Michigan State at home along with road games against Maryland and Indiana.\n\nThe Wolverines don\u2019t have room for error as they chase their first Big Ten title since 2004, which would end the school\u2019s longest conference championship drought.\n\n\u201cEvery game from now on is important for us to do what we want to do this season,\u201d linebacker Khaleke Hudson said.\n\nMichigan\u2019s defense has played at a relatively high level, other than against Wisconsin. And it has been very stingy since playing the Badgers, giving up just 111 yards rushing against Rutgers, Iowa and Illinois over the last three games.\n\nThe offense, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t figured out how to move the ball and score consistently well. The unit is also failing miserably at taking care of the football.\n\nMichigan ranks 10th in the Big Ten in red zone offense and is slightly worse on third-down conversions.\n\nFumbling has been the biggest problem under first-year coordinator Josh Gattis, a former Penn State assistant. The team ranks among the worst in college football with nine lost fumbles and 13 turnovers.\n\n\u201cOur defense has their identity,\u201d tight end Nick Eubanks said. \u201cOur offense is getting our identity. We found a groove of it. We believe it\u2019s coming together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a new offense, adversity is going to come. We came together and overcame the adversity.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://twitter.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Michigan linebacker Josh Uche recalls being excited when he saw the second half of this season's schedule.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/michigan_illinois_football_50580_c0-137-3300-2062_s1200x700.jpg?b8d17fcc5445bc61e64899c581368704c503e168", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
