It was, according to the outlet, a \u201cdefining moment\u201d of Sunday\u2019s \u201centhralling\u201d victory.\n\n\u201cThe tighthead prop was in tears, his game done, but the response of the Japan bench was, to a man, to run to the touchline and give the 25-year-old Takushoku University graduate a consoling hug,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe Brave Blossoms describe themselves as \u201cOne Team\u201d and their amazing run \u2026 has been a collective effort, one based on the Japanese work ethic and performed by an eclectic group devoted to playing and coaching for the land they live in.\u201d\n\n\u2018Japan\u2019s rugby team shows off the changing face of the nation\u2019\n\nOf the 23 players who were named in the match-day squad on Sunday, only 11 were born to Japanese parents. For Japan Today, the Brave Blossoms \u201coffer a diverse and slightly different look for an insular but changing country.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cThere was criticism of the amount of foreigners when the squad was announced in August, and that has died down as the team has gone on an unprecedented winning run through its pool.\u201d\n\n\u2018Congratulations to Japan the brave\u2019\n\nThe Brave Blossoms also drew praise from all levels of the Twittersphere.\n\nJapan\u2019s Prime Minister, Abe Shinzo, congratulated Joseph\u2019s men, tweeting that their ability to forge ahead under pressure \u201cgave courage\u201d to victims of Typhoon Hagibis, which just a day earlier flooded large swathes of the country and left more than 50 dead or missing.\n\nFormer England international Brian Moore tweeted: \u201cCongratulations to Japan the brave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed watching Japan more than any other team so far in this tournament.\u201d\n\n\u2018The most extraordinary game of rugby\u2019\n\nScott Hastings, a former Scotland and Lions player, said on Twitter: \u201cThe most extraordinary game of rugby #JAPvSCO \u2013 the atmosphere, the accuracy and speed that @JRFURugby played at was phenomenal \u2013 @Scotlandteam will return home to think again \u2013 euphoric despair!\u201d\n\nEven actor Russell Crowe got in the action, but kept things simple. \u201cJapan v Scotland... what a game,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFootage was also shared on the platform of Japan\u2019s fans celebrating the win at Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya Crossing, the busiest crossing in the world which, at peak times, sees upwards of 3,000 people scrambling across the intersection.\n\nSafe to say there\u2019ll be a few headaches among that lot this morning.\n\n\u2018We should be praising Japan instead of bemoaning Scotland\u2019s fate\u2019\n\nAnd what about the reaction in Scotland?\n\nAllan Massie of The Scotsman wrote: \u201cThe Scotland team had reason to be ashamed of their performance against Ireland, and indeed were ashamed. They have no cause to be ashamed today. Japan played as good rugby as any yet seen in this World Cup.\u201d\n\n\u2018A deflating failure\u2019\n\nThe Edinburgh Evening News, however, took a far more critical stance. \u201cFor Scotland, who had been described as the fittest and best-prepared squad to represent the country at a World Cup, it is a pool-stage exit for only the second time after 2011 and what can only be described as a deflating failure,\u201d it said.", "description": "Hosts Japan\u00a0made history on Sunday evening after beating Scotland\u00a028-21 to reach the quarter-finals of the Rugby World Cup for the first ever time.
