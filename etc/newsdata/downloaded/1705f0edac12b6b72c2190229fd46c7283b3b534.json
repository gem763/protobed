A league already touted for its compelling story lines, best-in-class progressivism, and support for individual expression had also seemed to achieve something like the grail of competitive parity. A series of off-season maneuvers among the highest tier of players had left the league more open than in recent memory; no longer would the Golden State Warriors start the season as presumptive champions.\n\nThen, over the weekend, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweet-and-deleted. The post was just an image that said, \u201cfight for freedom stand with Hong Kong,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t up long, but it launched a continuing news cycle about the NBA\u2019s interests and political bent. The league would likely have preferred to focus on Zion Williamson\u2019s first preseason dunks, or even on how Kevin Durant told Hot 97 that the Knicks are no longer a cool team. But Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests sat uneasily with an organization with massive strategic interests in growing the sport in China.\n\nIn its initial statement on Sunday, the NBA essentially asked Morey to get in line. \u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,\u201d spokesman Mike Bass said. \u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.\u201d\n\nFrom there, well, everyone else joined in. \u201cThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke tweeted. \u201cWhat an embarrassment.\u201d \u201cThe brave #BlueCheckBrigade has trouble distinguishing between what is inappropriate & what is dangerous,\u201d Marco Rubio wrote. \u201cPOTUS asking #China to investigate Biden is wrong, but it isn\u2019t going to happen. China regulating speech in America is dangerous & is actually happening via @NBA.\u201d Josh Hawley, Ben Sasse, Juli\u00e1n Castro, and Ted Cruz were among the other political participants landing in about the same place. Bari Weiss and the Washington Post editorial board too.\n\nThe breadth of that chorus brought into focus just how closely the league\u2019s public face is tied with its politics, however accurately. As a matter of precedent, the NBA is widely expected to take these sorts of opportunities to support free expression. But the tone among the Rockets was more cautious. The NBA was the first major American sports league to play in China, and the Chinese streaming platform Tencent has said that 500 million in the country watched NBA programming last season. The Rockets in particular have had an outsize presence in China ever since the team drafted Yao Ming in 2002.\n\nMorey himself didn\u2019t explicitly apologize, but he walked his sentiment back. \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nRockets owner Timan Fertitta later told ESPN, \u201cWe got a huge backlash, and I wanted to make clear that the organization has no political position. We\u2019re here to play basketball and not to offend anybody.\u201d Standing next to his fellow Rockets star Russell Westbrook after a practice in Tokyo on Monday, James Harden went so far as to apologize to Chinese fans: \u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,\u201d Harden told reporters. \u201cFor both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.\u201d", "description": "The NBA had a better reputation than any other professional American sports league\u2014but one tweet, and a subsequent diplomatic freak-out, may have changed all that, weeks before the season even begins.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Dan Adle", "Eric Lutz", "Yohana Desta", "Vanity Fair", "Alison Durkee", "Laura Bradley", "Bess Levin", "Kenzie Bryant"], "top_image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d9cf6396478d00009c48f23/16:9/w_2560,c_limit/Daryl-Morey-NBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
