An official cause of the blaze has yet to be determined, though authorities say it could be linked to ongoing renovations.\n\nThe structure is unlikely to reopen to the public for at least three years, a spokesman for the Parisian landmark said in April.\n\nThe fire prompted outreach from the international community, with $17.7 million worth of donations made to the Notre Dame Foundation in the two months after the fire. An additional $425 million was pledged by donors, though many big-money French donors did not immediately donate what they said they\u2019d give to the cause.", "description": "The melted scaffolding on top of the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral will reportedly be removed \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d so restoration work can begin, according to France\u2019s culture minister.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/notredamefire3_041519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
