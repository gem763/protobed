As such, its bright colors are almost as good as new.\n\nWhat made it even more special was an attached handwritten note, which read: \"Maori mat worn by the Chief Rewi when peace was declared between Maoris and Europeans after the Battle of Orakau,\" according to a press release from Burstow & Hewett.\n\nRead More", "description": "A small British auction house has withdrawn from sale a rare Maori cloak which apparently once belonged to a tribal chief, after receiving online intimidation.", "authors": ["Lianne Kolirin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190913105726-02-maori-shawl-auction-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
