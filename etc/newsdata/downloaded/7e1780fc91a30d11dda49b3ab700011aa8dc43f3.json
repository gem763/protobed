That cold is good for you.\n\nAt least that's what proponents of cryotherapy claim. Cryotherapy emerged around 2015 as a recovery method for elite athletes like LeBron James and slowly found its way into mainstream wellness culture.\n\nFor 2-5 minutes, clothed only in socks, Crocs, and gloves, you stand in an insulated cryochamber that is filled with air that ranges between -120 and -150 degrees Celsius. Supposedly, this triggers a shock response from your body, which then redirects bloodflow from your limbs to your core.\n\nCryotherapy proponents claim that the treatment offers a whole host of benefits, including increased metabolism, heightened endorphin levels, weight loss, muscle pain relief, improved skin, and glossier hair.\n\nHowever, the science behind cryotherapy is a little shaky.
