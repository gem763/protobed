Katsouleas and UConn\u2019s chief of police, Hans Rhynhart.\n\n\u201cHowever offensive the use of a racial epithet, not directed at any person, the First Amendment protects offensive language, and neither the University of Connecticut nor its police officers may abridge students\u2019 First Amendment rights,\u201d Mr. Steinbaugh wrote, demanding the university drop any charges. By \u201cinvestigating and arresting students who use offensive language, UConn has departed from its clear and non-negotiable constitutional obligations.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 11, Mr. Karal and Mr. Mucaj were walking home from a bar and pizzeria near midnight when the pair began playing a game in which each dared the other to say, \u201cpenis,\u201d in an increasingly loud voice until one man quit or whispered it, and at some point during the game, the word reportedly morphed into the n-word, according to The Daily Campus, the UConn student newspaper.\n\nAnother student, playing video games in his dorm room, reportedly heard them early in the game and sprang to his window to begin videotaping them. When Mr. Karal and Mr. Mucaj allegedly saw the student filming them, according to his account, they fell silent for a time and then switched to the N-word.\n\nThe videotaping student, whose name has not been released, did not actually catch the n-word but after rewatching the clip and turning up the volume determined it was the racial slur, according to affidavits cited by The Daily Campus.\n\n\u201cAs the group transitioned to saying (the N-word) they began to speak in a much softer tone and were not screaming nearly as loud as they had been previously,\u201d the taping student was quoted as saying.\n\nHe reported the incident, which led to Mr. Mucaj\u2019s and Mr. Karal\u2019s arrest by university police on charges of violating Connecticut General Statute 53-37, which bans ridicule on account of creed, religion, color, denomination, nationality or race, according to UConn spokesman Stephanie Reitz.\n\nA third man walking in the parking lot with the other two, who apparently did not participate in the game and told them they should stop playing it, was not charged.\n\nThe Daily Campus reported that the arrested students gave differing accounts to university police, with Mr. Karal admitting what happened and apologizing for the game, which he insisted was not directed at any person and was instead just general foolishness. Mr. Mucaj said he was drunk and did not remember what was said, according to the affidavits.\n\nDespite the ignoble behavior, UConn has no right even to investigate its students for words unquestionably protected by the First Amendment, according to FIRE.\n\n\u201cEven short of arrest, UConn\u2019s maintenance of a lengthy investigation, coupled with its refusal to clarify to reporters whether it might pursue disciplinary action against the students involved, is itself a violation of the First Amendment,\u201d Mr. Steinbaugh wrote.\n\nFIRE also objected to Mr. Katsouleas\u2019 praising university police for their actions and painting the incident in dire terms.\n\nThe school \u201cis supportive of our core values to pursue accountablity, through due process, for an egregious assault on our community that has caused considerable harm,\u201d Mr. Katsouleas said in a UConn statement at the time.\n\nMr. Steinbaugh told school officials that the case was so obvious that the officers who arrested the students should not be praised.\n\n\u201cIn the course of a ten-day investigation over a high-profile controversy, the university and its law enforcement officers must have learned both that the students\u2019 speech was protected and that the statute through which it justified their arrests was unconstitutional,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf they did not, it is a remarkable failure for an institution ostensibly dedicated to furthering freedom of expression, and it is disappointing that the leadership of such an institution would praise law enforcement for arresting its students.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
