Jurors determined that Gilead should pay $2.54 billion in damages, which was the largest verdict ever in a U.S. patent case.\n\nBut a federal judge in Delaware tossed the verdict in 2018, saying the Merck patent should not have been granted in the first place because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.\n\nIn Wednesday's split decision, the appeals court said it agreed with that determination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jan Wolfe; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Leslie Adler)", "description": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a determination by a federal judge in Delaware that the Merck patent at issue in the case, which relates to hepatitis C treatment, was invalid.
