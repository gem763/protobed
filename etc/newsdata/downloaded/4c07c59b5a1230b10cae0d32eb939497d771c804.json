Wait ... What?", "language": "en", "text": "BOSTON (AP) - Boston College hasn\u2019t been to the NCAA Tournament in a decade, and when coach Jim Christian looked ahead to this season he naturally wanted a reasonable goal for the program.\n\nSo he picked \u2026 the Final Four?\n\n\u201cPeople may say I\u2019m crazy. I think if you don\u2019t approach it that way, then what are you trying to do? What are we doing?\u201d Christian said at the Eagles\u2019 media day to preview his sixth season on the BC bench. \u201cWhy would we limit ourselves? Play it out.\n\n\u201cStop thinking about this, stop thinking about that. Stop thinking about trying to get to the tournament. We need to try to get to the Final Four,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 15 teams. Why are we different? We need to come out here and try to get to the Final Four like everybody else.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lofty goal for a program that went 14-17 (5-13 Atlantic Coast Conference) last season, but Christian spent some time this summer visiting Chris Beard at Texas Tech and one of the things he learned down in Lubbock was that things can turn around quickly. The Red Raiders went 6-12 in the Big 12 three years ago, then went to the Elite Eight in 2018 and the NCAA championship game last season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a Texas Tech\u201d this year, Christian said. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to go to the Final Four, but we are going to pursue it with everything we have. Stop listening to predictions, stop listening to whatever and (say) \u2018Why can\u2019t we do that?\u2019\u201d\n\nChristian took over in Chestnut Hill in 2014 and went 0-18 in the Atlantic Coast Conference in his second season. They snapped the streak the next year, winning two league games, and made a big jump two years ago, when they won seven times in the ACC and had 19 wins overall - the only winning record of Christian\u2019s tenure.\n\nBut last year was a step back, as the Eagles failed to find a consistent scorer to replace Jerome Robinson. Wynston Tabbs showed promise, but he went out with a knee injury in January and will miss this season as well.\n\nAlso gone are Ky Bowman (19 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4 assists), who went undrafted and signed with the Golden State Warriors. Jordan Chatman (13.2, 2.2, 2) graduated, leaving senior Nik Popovic (14.5 points, 7.1 rebounds) as the only one of the team\u2019s top four scorers from last year to return.\n\n\u201cI was just a child when I came here. I was not a mature guy,\u201d Popovic said. \u201cI went to becoming somebody that can actually play, create and be a leader.\u201d\n\nIN WAITING\n\nDerryck Thornton inherits the job as point guard with Tabbs out for the season following left knee surgery. As a freshman last year, Tabbs started 14 games, averaging 13.9 point, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists.\n\n\u201cDerryck is a true point guard, and we\u2019ve never had that before until Wynston came. And Wynston didn\u2019t stay long,\u201d Popovic said. \u201cWhen we learned he wasn\u2019t going to play it was like \u2018What now?\u2019 And then Derryck came in, and it was like relief for us.\u201d\n\nThornton started his career at Duke, then transferred to Southern California and came to BC this season as a graduate transfer.\n\n\u201cBC\u2019s had some tough years and so have I,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m really rolling now as a player. I think this season is almost going to be comeback season, not only for myself but for the whole program. We have so much young talent and returners that have talent. I think we\u2019re going to shock a lot of people.\u201d\n\nALL ABOUT THE HAMILTONS\n\nJairus Hamilton, who is 6-foot-8 and 240 pounds, was the first top 100 recruit to commit to BC since Craig Smith in 2002. As a freshman last year, he averaged 5.6 points and four rebounds. His older brother, Jared, is a 6-foot-4 guard who transferred from Georgia Southern last semester became eligible midseason, averaging six points.\n\nChristian said Jairus Hamilton \u201cis still trying to make the game a little simpler for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about understanding the game,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI took a lot of time watching film \u2026 understanding the time and the decision making of the game at that time. I feel like I\u2019ve really grown on that.\u201d\n\nROUGH ROAD\n\nThe ACC schedule rotation brings two games against Duke this year, and two against defending champion Virginia.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time the Eagles will double up against those two powers since 2012-13.\n\n\u201cAs a competitive person as I am, I love that,\u201d forward Steffon Mitchell said. \u201cYou can\u2019t come to the ACC if you\u2019re not looking forward to those games. Those are games that everybody wants to play in. \u2026 You get up for those game every time. It doesn\u2019t matter how you\u2019re feeling or how you\u2019re playing. The emotions of it are just special.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Boston College hasn't been to the NCAA Tournament in a decade, and when coach Jim Christian looked ahead to this season he naturally wanted a reasonable goal for the program.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jimmy Golen"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
