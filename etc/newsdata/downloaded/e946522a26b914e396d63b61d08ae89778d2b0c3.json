Court documents reveal that Gunton somehow managed to convince a mobile telco's operator to add a call forwarding number to Coburn's mobile account.\n\nThis meant that any incoming calls for Coburn's phone would be silently forwarded to a Google Voice number operated by the two.\n\nGunton and Nashatka didn't waste any time and immediately used the call forwarding feature to silently bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) on Coburn's EtherDelta (admin) account.\n\nA day later, on December 20, the two moved in to capitalize on their hack. They first started by modifying DNS settings in the company's G Suite portal and redirected Gmail traffic through a UK server they owned, allowing the two to intercept and hide certain emails.\n\nThe next step was to reset the password on EtherDelta's Cloudflare account, retrieve the password reset link from Coburn's intercepted emails, and access the Cloudflare account as new owners, changing the password and locking out other company employees.\n\nThe final step was to change EtherDelta's DNS records inside the Cloudflare account and add new values, effectively pointing the EtherDelta official site to a web server they operated. Here, the two hosted a clone of the original site, but one that logged users' credentials.\n\nThe DNS redirection lasted only a few hours until it was spotted and widely reported in the media.\n\nAfter their plan was exposed, the two moved on to cash in on the stolen credentials. While court documents don't say how much the two made, they do reveal that one victim reported losing more than $800,000.\n\nGunton already sentenced in the UK\n\nThe indictment was filed on August 13, in San Francisco. Three days later, Gunton was sentenced to 20 months in prison in the UK for trading personal data online, for cryptocurrency, following his arrest in 2018. The US case is believed to have stemmed from the data found on Gunton's devices.\n\nIn the US, the two face five counts each, with maximum prison penalties of up to 20 years, up to three years of supervised released, and a fine of up to $250,000.\n\nIronically, in November 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission also charged Coburn, the EtherDelta CEO, with running an unregistered securities exchange [PDF].", "description": "Elliot Gunton and Anthony Tyler Nashatka charged for 2015 EtherDelta hack.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/dc4dffa6-b8aa-4a66-bc17-87cbe436dfc5/thumbnail/770x578/11f7f02c2b5e614abdbe6e0d9c04f006/20190920-175155-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
