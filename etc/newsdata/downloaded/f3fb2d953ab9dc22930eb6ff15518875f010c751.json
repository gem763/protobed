As moms in today\u2019s world it can feel like we\u2019re all competing for a trophy that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"I literally thought in that delivery room that I would somehow be 'less than' as mother for tapping out and asking for the drugs. Like there would be a gold medal or AT LEAST a gold sticker on my medical chart for having a natural birth.\n\n\"Since having this third sweet boy six weeks ago I\u2019ve given lots more thought to the invisible trophies we create as moms. Some society creates for us. Standards we try so hard to measure up to even though the contest is make believe and we were made to live in community, not competition.\"\n\nAshley then reminds fellow mums that there's no trophy for losing baby weight the fastest, for breastfeeding vs bottle feeding or for coming up with the most creative birthday party theme.\n\nShe finished her post by adding a very sincere and important message for her followers.\n\n\"My husband has no idea how meaningful those words have been allowing me to relax into having a newborn again. And I wanted to invite you to relax into motherhood with me.\n\n\"Because the only trophy you\u2019ll carry through life is the bond you create with your baby. And we all go home from the hospital with a big basket of mesh undies and sanitary pads the size of our newborns no matter how glamorous our Insta pics look.\"", "description": "A mum has shared the simple words her partner said to her in the delivery room - and why she thinks all parents need to hear them", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty", "Moment Rm"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20264879.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Young-mother-giving-birth-to-a-baby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
