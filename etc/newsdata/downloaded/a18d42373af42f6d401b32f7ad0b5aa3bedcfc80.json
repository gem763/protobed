What Comes Next?: Term Sheet", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re far from the days when the most egregious thing WeWork did was refuse to allow employees to expense meals containing meat.\n\nYesterday, WeWork officially pulled the plug on its initial public offering after announcing that it would withdraw its S-1 registration statement. Co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham said, \u201cWe have decided to postpone our IPO to focus on our core business, the fundamentals of which remain strong.\u201d\n\nThey further said they have every intention to take WeWork public in the future. It\u2019s unclear when that will occur, but it likely won\u2019t happen before the end of the year. That poses several question marks for WeWork, one of which being the $6 billion line of credit contingent on the company going public before the end of 2019.\n\nWeWork has been re-negotiating a new loan with banks led by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to replace the loan it was expected to get after its public offering, according to The New York Times. The banks are now reportedly offering less than the $6 billion that was previously negotiated.\n\nSantosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, told Fortune that the major investors in WeWork are somewhat stuck. \"I\u2019m sure [the financing] can be renegotiated,\" he said. \"At this point, I think that the bankers have invested a lot already, so they\u2019re not going to abandon ship at this point, they will stay the course. It may be renegotiated, maybe on different terms, and maybe they have to pay a higher rate ... but it\u2019ll get done. It\u2019s in the best interest of the banks.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, cost-cutting is in order. WeWork had $2.5 billion in cash as of June 30. At the current rate of cash burn \u2014 about $700 million a quarter \u2014 it would run out of money some time after the first quarter of 2020, according to The Wall Street Journal. There are reports of mass layoffs, the sale of the company jet, and the offloading of some businesses that WeWork had previously acquired.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s next for WeWork. Could the co-working giant regain its footing following its whirlwind of a year? Anything could happen if it gets its numbers in order.\n\nOne compelling tweet I saw was from Collaboration Fund\u2019s Morgan Housel: \u201cWeWork's fall is fascinating because it wasn't hurt by an investigative journalist, a whistleblower, or a customer revolt. It just released its IPO prospectus and *poof*, reality took the reins from the storytelling.\u201d (Housel also wrote a piece on WeWork with great analysis here.)\n\nBelieving in a company\u2019s potential makes sense in the early days, but that blind belief also got WeWork to a $47-billion valuation that many felt was unjustified. So a fluffy mission of \"elevating the world's consciousness\u201d is great \u2014 as long as you can back it up with facts. As Housel notes in his piece, \u201cMagic has to be verified with cold, hard numbers.\u201d\n\nDIRECT LISTINGS ARE ON FIRE: As we noted yesterday, a group of Silicon Valley elite will meet today for an invite-only event in San Francisco to discuss \u201cthe benefits of the direct listing approach to a public listing.\u201d Bloomberg reported today that home-sharing startup Airbnb is laying the groundwork for a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO for its public market debut in 2020.
