But he made few bones about his concerns surrounding Trump\u2019s continued pursuit of the elusive deal.\n\nBolton set the tone by noting early on that he was about to speak about North Korea in \u201cunvarnished terms\u201d and suggested that Kim was happy to see him outside the White House. Bolton then suggested that the negotiations between the two sides were very likely to be fruitless.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the North Koreans will ever voluntarily give up enough\u201d in negotiations, Bolton said, adding, \u201cThere is no basis to trust any promise that regime makes.\u201d\n\nBolton said the United States should stop focusing on summits with Kim and instead pursue a harder approach involving possible regime change and even military force to stop the North Korean nuclear program.\n\nHe also suggested that the Trump administration, as it pursues a nuclear deal, is giving North Korea too much of a pass on its violations of U.N. Security Council sanctions.\n\n\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton delivers the keynote address at the JoongAng Ilbo-CSIS Forum in Washington on Sept. 30.

He was asked whether he agrees with the idea of \u201cbromance diplomacy\u201d \u2014 a term used to reflect Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to emphasize how nice Kim is to him. Bolton said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on that,\u201d as the audience laughed. \u201cNice try.\u201d\n\nThe idea that Bolton would take these positions is hardly surprising. He is among the more hawkish foreign policy voices in today\u2019s Republican Party, and he took similar positions on North Korea long before joining the administration. But it was notable that he decided to raise ideas that were so contrary to Trump\u2019s No. 1 foreign policy goal so soon after leaving the administration.\n\nBolton has been sending signals ever since his exit that he\u2019s not particularly optimistic about what lies ahead in Trump\u2019s foreign policy. Within hours of Bolton\u2019s resignation announcement, an anonymous aide was telling reporters, \u201cSince Ambassador Bolton has been national security adviser over the last 17 months, there have been no bad deals.\u201d (The implication being that any deals that come now would not reflect upon Bolton.)\n\nThe big question with Bolton is how far he\u2019s willing to go \u2014 and whether he might be a key witness in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry over Ukraine. Bolton was in office when, according to a whistleblower, the White House attempted to bury what Trump told Ukraine\u2019s president on a code-word-level National Security Council computer. As national security adviser, Bolton led that council.\n\nWhen Bolton departed earlier this month, Trump attacked him for having advocated in 2018 the \u201cLibya model\u201d for North Korea \u2014 the idea that North Korea would completely abandon its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cWhen he talked about the \u2018Libyan model\u2019 for Kim Jong Un, that was not a good statement to make,\u201d Trump said, noting that the Libya model led to the downfall of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi. \u201cThat was not a good statement to make. And it set us back.\u201d\n\nBolton said Monday that the Libya model was \u201cfeasible\u201d yet difficult. But he then contrasted it with the folly of seeking a middle-ground approach with North Korea.\n\n\u201cIt may be the Libya model is not possible,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cBut what I regard as even worse, in a way, is pretending that you\u2019re getting to a resolution of the nuclear issue when you simply allow North Korea still to have a nuclear capability but give it enough economic assistance \u2026 that gives the regime a lifeline it currently doesn\u2019t have.\u201d", "description": "It was subtle, but it was unmistakable.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sZsOZMoPH9oRh75oFTDxmfdweEw=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-30-2019/t_fa0b54610c1b46d8a2395d5630286408_name_1920_bolton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
