(TSLA) , that sent shares soaring 17.7% in after-market activity. Jim commented further on Tesla in his Real Money column and TSLA is holding onto a big gain Thursday so let's find a charging station and check out the charts and indicators.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of TSLA, below, we can see a bullish alignment of the indicators before Thursday's upside price gap. Note the rising 50-day moving average line and the strength in the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line earlier this month. More aggressive buying in the weeks ahead of the news suggests that people closer to the company were buyers. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator turned up above the zero line in September for a buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of TSLA, below, we can see a positive picture leading up to today's price strength. TSLA was already above the declining 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been rising from late May and the MACD oscillator gave a cover shorts buy signal in late June and is now not far below the zero line.\n\nIn this first Point and Figure chart of TSLA, below, we can Thursday's breakout and rapid rally. Point and Figure charts do not have gaps so we have a long column of X's. An upside price target of $342 is being projected.\n\nIn this second Point and Figure chart of TSLA, below, we used weekly closing prices to construct the chart. Here a potential upside price target of $392 is being projected.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The base in TSLA goes back to June so it can support prices higher than where we are now. Do not count on or expect that TSLA will pull back to fill any of the price gap. Wait for some sideways price action to go long and use a stop below the lows of that price action.", "description": "Tesla Signaled Its Change of Direction Before Thursday's Upside Breakout...TSLA", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Tesla Signaled Its Change Of Direction Before Thursday'S Upside Breakout", "Do Not Count On Tsla Pulling Back To Fill Any Of The Price Gap.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Ed Ponsi", "Doug Kass", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden", "Jim Cramer"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/ee418489-e384-11e9-822b-cdb7c7fa10d4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
