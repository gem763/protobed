(\u201cTILT\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (CSE: TILT) (OTCQB: TLLTF), a foundational technology cannabis platform comprised of assets to support brands worldwide, announced today that its plant-touching operating asset Commonwealth Alternative Care (\u201cCAC\u201d) has received local approval(i) for adult-use cannabis sales at its retail store in Taunton, Massachusetts.\n\nCAC began selling cannabis to patients through the Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana program in August of 2018. Legislation in Massachusetts was passed in late 2016 legalizing adult-use cannabis although the program faced delays and sales only began in November of 2018. CAC has been working closely with local regulatory bodies and the state\u2019s Cannabis Control Commission (\u201cCCC\u201d) in order to process an application to allow Massachusetts residents above the age of 21 to purchase cannabis products at its retail outlet in Taunton. The approval is conditional pending completion of a few milestones for CAC as well as final approval from the CCC, which the Company hopes to receive in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWe have always had a tremendous opportunity with our plant-touching assets in the Massachusetts market and this approval brings us one step closer to capturing additional market share through adult-use cannabis sales,\u201d said Mark Scatterday, interim CEO of TILT. \u201cWith the overwhelming support for this approval shown by the City Council\u2019s 8-1 vote, we are confident that we have all of the pieces in place to receive final approval on an adult-use permit for our Taunton retail facility. Beyond our wholesale business that continues to see high growth, our vertically integrated positioning in the state creates an opportunity for additional high-margin cannabis product sales and customer awareness. We are proud of the work the team has done on the ground in Massachusetts and look forward to further updates out of that operating asset.\u201d\n\nWith almost 7 million residents, the Massachusetts cannabis market is expected to exceed $1 billion(ii) by next year. The Company has a noteworthy early-mover advantage in this \u201climited-license\u201d market as one of the first to have vertically integrated operations from its production facility in the same city. The Company recently announced increases in its revenue generated from wholesale cannabis sales in the market under the direction of cannabis industry expert and newly appoint COO Tim Conder. Furthermore, the Company sees potential in leveraging(iii) its other core operating assets such as technology and distribution powerhouse Blackbird/Baker as well as leading hardware supplier Jupiter Research.\n\nTo learn more about TILT Holdings, Inc. visit www.tiltholdings.com.\n\nAbout TILT\n\nTILT Holdings serves cannabis brands worldwide through a strong network of portfolio companies committed to technological innovations that support long-term success.
