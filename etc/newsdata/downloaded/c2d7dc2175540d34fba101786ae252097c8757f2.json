Recently, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins and Malachi \u201cReverse2k\u201d Greiner attempted to break the \"Fortnite\" record for most duo wins in a row.\n\nThe record Ninja and Reverse2k had been chasing was set by Siqqza, who won 42 duo games in a row.\n\nThis record is impressive and many \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" players have tried to break it, but they haven't been successful. On October 2, around 6:20 PM Eastern Time, Ninja and Reverse2k won their 42nd duo game in a row, tying the record. In their next game, the team landed on a relatively unpopular location west of Sunny Steps, and they eventually won the game, breaking the record.\n\nThe record now stands at 43 wins and counting\n\nNinja, who is still one of the most popular \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" players, has a 58 percent win rate in Duos in Season X.\n\nHis K/D ratio is over 16.2, and he has had the best stats in this mode when compared to the other two core modes. On the other side, Reverse2k's winning percentage in Duos mode in the current season is around 47 percent with 12.4 K/D ratio. Just like his Duo partner, Reverse2k has the best stats in this mode.\n\nThese two players struggled in a few games, but they managed to stay focused and break the impressive record.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!
