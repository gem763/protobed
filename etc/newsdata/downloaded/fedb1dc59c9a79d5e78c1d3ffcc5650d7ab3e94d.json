Because that's close to spy,\" Trump says on the recording. \"You know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Times obtained and released the recording.\n\nIn a formal complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general, the whistleblower said \"I was not a direct witness to most of the events described\" but had received information over the past four months from multiple U.S. government officials alleging that Trump \"is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\"\n\nThe whistleblower found the accounts by colleagues to be credible because \"in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another.\"\n\nThe allegations stem from a July telephone conversation in which Trump urged Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to help investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump maintains the conversation was \"absolutely perfect\" and says he did nothing wrong.\n\nMeeting with Trump on Wednesday in New York, Zelenskiy said \"nobody pushed me\" during what he said was a \"normal\" conversation with Trump.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., yielded Tuesday to mounting pressure from her caucus and announced the launch of an impeachment inquiry against Trump. She cited alarm over reports that Trump had turned to a foreign country for political assistance, along with the administration's refusal to send the complaint to Congress, as expected by law.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday released a rough transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy conversation, the same day the whistleblower's complaint was sent to Congress. The House Intelligence Committee released a redacted version of the complaint, totaling nine pages, on Thursday.\n\nTrump's comments Thursday at the New York event led the Democratic chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees to warn the president to temper his comments because they are seeking to hear from the whistleblower and other individuals referenced in the complaint.\n\n\"The president's comments today constitute reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress' impeachment inquiry,\" Reps. Eliot Engel of New York, Adam Schiff of California and Elijah Cummings of Maryland said in a joint statement. \"Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.\"\n\nFormer State Department and other officials who have participated in events similar to Thursday's, which are standard for presidents, also condemned Trump's remarks. They urged lawmakers from both political parties to do the same.\n\n\"The president of the United States threatened potential charges of treason and execution to those who would dare report abuses of power,\" the statement said.\n\n\"An American leader issuing such threats in front of public servants, not to mention their young children, is a dangerous and damaging development for our country. Such a statement is not only illegal, it is immoral.\"\n\nThe White House had no comment.", "description": "President Donald Trump lashed out on Thursday at the person who gave information to a whistleblower who has accused the president of abusing the nation's highest office for political gain, saying that individual is \"close to a spy\" who could have committed treason - an act punishable by", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zz_GmMrixk89k0ys.SuePg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/0ddf6766fdf657b669c170a52762df84", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
