I\u2019m meeting with the vice premier over at the White House, and I think it\u2019s going really well,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see them tomorrow, right here, and it\u2019s going very, very well.\u201d\n\nIt was previously reported that the Chinese negotiating team might leave Washington earlier than planned due to worsening relationship with the U.S. Earlier this week, the U.S. blacklisted eight Chinese technology firms.\n\nBut things were looking more optimistic yesterday after some reports suggested that China is open to a partial trade deal and even offer to purchase more U.S.-made agricultural products.\n\nDespite the positive trade news today, China\u2019s slipped 0.1% by 10:45 PM ET (02:45 GMT), while the SZSE Component was down 0.4%.\n\nOther Asian markets rose. Hong Kong\u2019s gained 0.7%, while Japan\u2019s and South Korea\u2019s both traded 1.0% higher.\n\nDown under, Australia\u2019s climbed 0.8%.", "description": "Chinese Stocks Slip Despite \"Very Good\" Trade Talks; Other Asian Markets Rise", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0B0BR_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
