Livingston had tweeted that Kik had signed a letter-of-intent with a \u201cgreat company,\u201d but that it was \u201cnot a done deal.\u201d\n\nNow we know the the company: MediaLab. In a post on Kik\u2019s blog on Friday the MediaLab said that it has \u201cfinalized an agreement\u201d to acquire Kik Messenger.\n\n\u201cKik is one of those amazing places that brings us back to those early aspirations,\u201d the blog post read. \u201cWhether it be a passion for an obscure manga or your favorite football team, Kik has shown an incredible ability to provide a platform for new friendships to be forged through your mobile phone.\u201d\n\nMediaLab is a holding company that owns several other mobile properties, including anonymous social network Whisper and mixtape app DatPiff. In acquiring Kik, the holding company is expanding its mobile app portfolio.\n\nMediaLab said it has \u201csome ideas\u201d for developing Kik going forwards, including making the app faster and reducing the amount of unwanted messages and spam bots. The company said it will introduce ads \u201cover the coming weeks\u201d in order to \u201ccover our expenses\u201d of running the platform.\n\nBuying the Kik messaging platform adds another social media weapon to the arsenal for MediaLab and its chief executive, Michael Heyward .\n\nHeyward was an early star of the budding Los Angeles startup community with the launch of the anonymous messaging service, Whisper nearly 8 years ago. At the time, the company was one of a clutch of anonymous apps \u2014 including Secret and YikYak \u2014 that raised tens of millions of dollars to offer online iterations of the confessional journal, the burn book, and the bathroom wall (respectively).\n\nIn 2017, TechCrunch reported that Whisper underwent significant layoffs to stave off collapse and put the company on a path to profitability.\n\nAt the time Whisper had roughly 20 million monthly active users across its app and website, which the company was looking to monetize through programmatic advertising, rather than brand-sponsored campaigns that had provided some of the company\u2019s revenue in the past. Through widgets, the company had an additional 10 million viewers of its content per-month using various widgets and a reach of around 250 million through Facebook and other social networks on which it published posts.\n\nPeople familiar with the company said at the time that it was seeing gross revenues of roughly $1 million and was going to hit $12.5 million in revenue for that calendar year. By 2018 that revenue was expected to top $30 million, according to sources at the time.\n\nThe flagship Whisper app let people post short bits of anonymous text and images that other folks could like or comment about. Heyward intended it to be a way for people to share more personal and intimate details \u2014 to be a social network for confessions and support rather than harassment.\n\nThe idea caught on with investors and Whisper managed to raise $61 million from investors including Sequoia, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Shasta Ventures . Whisper\u2019s last round was a $36 million Series C back in 2014.\n\nFast forward to 2018 when Secret had been shut down for three years while YikYak also went bust \u2014 selling off its engineering team to Square for around $1 million. Whisper, meanwhile, seemingly set up MediaLab as a holding company for its app and additional assets that Heyward would look to roll up. The company filed registration documents in California in June 2018.\n\nAccording to the filings, Susan Stone, a partner with the investment firm Sierra Wasatch Capital, is listed as a director for the company.\n\nHeyward did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nZack Whittaker contributed reporting for this article.", "description": "Popular messaging app Kik is, indeed, \u201chere to stay\u201d following an acquisition by the Los Angeles-based multimedia holding company, MediaLab.
