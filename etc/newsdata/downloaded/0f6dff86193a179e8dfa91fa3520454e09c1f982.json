Though Facebook has suffered more scrutiny and reputational damage for its role in 2016, it was cable, not social networks, that went gaga pumping up Trump d uring the campaign. Today, it\u2019s the toxic feedback swirl of Twitter and cable \u2014 and a president and a press corps that spend all hours feeding on one another\u2019s digital droppings in a dystopian circle of life \u2014 that has rendered our political culture so vulnerable to reflexive, narrow-minded conspiracies, tribalism and groupthink.\n\nLately, however, I\u2019ve found myself gorging like a bear in salmon season on the worst, most brain-corroding corner of cable, the network I\u2019ve called a \u201cforked-tongue colossus\u201d for its two-decades-long project of dismantling our collective hold on the truth.
