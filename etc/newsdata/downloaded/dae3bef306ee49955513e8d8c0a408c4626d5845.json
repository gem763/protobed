Of course, that includes my husband.\n\n'Getting married to him was the best thing that ever happened to me. My husband's the best. He's the greatest human being, and he's my great partner. Marriage is certainly hard, and it's a lot of work. You need somebody who's willing to do the work with you, because there's no 60-40 in marriage. It's 50-50 period. All the time.'\n\nThe Bad Teacher star wasn't sure if she was 'ready' for marriage when they got hitched, but she always knew Benji was 'special'.\n\nShe added: 'I don't know if I was ready [when I got married], but I knew Benji was special. He's just a good man. There's no bulls***. It's really refreshing. I'm grateful for him.'\n\nCameron also insisted she's in no rush to return to the spotlight. She said: 'The way I look at it is that I've given more than half of my life to the public. I feel it's OK for me to take time for myself now and choose how I want to come [back] into the world. If I decide to.\n\n'I don't miss performing. Right now I'm looking at the landscape of wellness and all that. But whatever I do, it has to be something I'm passionate about - something that just feels effortless.'", "description": "She's going into the weekend with a fresh face.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/07/20208378-0-image-a-75_1572070029185.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
