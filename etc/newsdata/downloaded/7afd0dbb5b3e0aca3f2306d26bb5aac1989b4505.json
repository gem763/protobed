However, a Foreign Relations Committee aide said votes on Hong Kong-related measures were expected in the chamber in the coming weeks.\n\nThe third measure passed by the House is a non-binding resolution recognising Hong Kong's relationship to the United States, condemning Beijing's \"interference\" in its affairs, and supporting the right of the city's residents to protest.\n\nThe Hong Kong government expressed regret over the passage of the legislation and reiterated that foreign legislatures should not interfere in the city's internal affairs.\n\nThe fourth measure was another non-binding House resolution commending Canada for its actions related to a US request to extradite Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies, who was arrested in Canada in December.\n\nMeng is charged in the United States with bank fraud and is accused of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc about Huawei's business in Iran, which is under US sanctions. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.\n\nThe United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions. Many Republican and Democratic members of Congress say they view the company as a security threat.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by at times violent protests over concerns Beijing is tightening its grip on the former British colony and eroding its democratic system.\n\nBeijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, like the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He has warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] The US House of Representatives on Tuesday passed four pieces of legislation taking a hard line on China, three related to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and one commending Canada in its dispute over the extradition of a Chinese telecom executive. .
