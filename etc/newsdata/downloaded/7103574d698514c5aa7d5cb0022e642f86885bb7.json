It is now better known for something else: a string of flops and its mastery of face-saving accounting wheezes.\n\nThe dumb money was not so dumb after all. Public investors rejected WeWork\u2019s plan to float.\n\nInstead, SoftBank \u2014 supposedly the smart money in tech \u2014 will double down on its investment in the controversial US offices business. The Japanese group will inject $US6.5 billion ($9.5 billion) to dodge a writedown and save face. The constituency convinced by SoftBank\u2019s accounting manoeuvres is dwindling fast.\n\nThe investment group would wind up with 80 per cent of WeWork\u2019s equity. Yet even with a majority economic stake, SoftBank would not take full control. It plans to redirect voting rights acquired from founder Adam Neumann to an expanded WeWork board. It will classify WeWork as an associate rather than a subsidiary.\n\nDoing so attracts lenient accounting treatment. Without technical control, SoftBank does not need to record the investment at cost and later adjust it according to its earnings performance \u2013 or the lack thereof. Instead, because SoftBank may hold WeWork shares for transfer to its Vision Fund, they would be a financial asset measured at fair value. This is in the eye of the beholder for an unlisted stock.\n\nSoftBank has been adept at registering increases in stakes, sometimes through transactions in small parcels of shares, that boosts the notional value of the whole. At SoftBank it contributes to reported group earnings which are also swelled by a share of paper profits from subsidiaries.", "description": "SoftBank was once seen as a master of tech investing for buying early stakes in Yahoo and Alibaba.
