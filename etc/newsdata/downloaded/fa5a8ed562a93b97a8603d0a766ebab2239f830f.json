The CIA reportedly assisted in the locating of the terror chief.\n\nTrump tweeted without explanation on Saturday, 'Something very big has just happened!'\n\nEarly reports suggests Baghdadi may have detonated his suicide vest in the raid, killing himself.\n\nAn audio recording believed to be the voice of Baghdadi was release last month, and called for ISIS members to free Muslims held by 'Crusaders and their Shiite followers.'\n\nThe US had reportedly placed $25 million bounty on the head of the terror leader.\n\nThe reported death of such a high-value US target comes amid a difficult political backdrop fro Trump, who has been frustrated by the U.S. news media's heavy focus on the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, which he calls an illegitimate witch hunt.\n\nHe has also faced withering criticism from both Republicans and Democrats alike for his U.S. troop withdrawal from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America's Kurdish allies.\n\nTrump was expected to make the statement in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, which he has used to make a number of major announcements.\n\nJust last week he used the same room to announce that a ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds had taken hold.
