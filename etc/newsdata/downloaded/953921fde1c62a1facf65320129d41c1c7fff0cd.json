Our main aim is that that company survives, and everything continues as normal.\n\n\u201cSo we have to be extremely careful that we don\u2019t have to cause the company to collapse ourselves by taking any actions.\u201d\n\nWhen Monarch Airlines \u2013 a much smaller operation \u2013 collapsed two years ago, planespotters had already predicted the carrier\u2019s imminent demise, based on identifying aircraft movements around Europe that clearly mimicked the doomed airline\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cWe never position planes until 48 hours before the failure,\u201d says Cohen.\n\n\u201cSome of these planespotters, they should be working for the security services, they\u2019re so good at it. What we learnt is that we have to put these planes in locations where they\u2019re not easily spotted.\n\n\u201cSo if we have an American carrier that\u2019s used to going somewhere like Shannon [in Ireland] for troop movements, then we put the plane there. And that tends to work.\u201d\n\nFinding planes was particularly tricky this autumn, he says, because of the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 Max after two fatal accidents.\n\n\u201cThe issues with the 737 Max meant that many of the aircraft we would like to get in this particular instance were not available to us. So we had to use aircraft from smaller carriers, which have less resilience.\n\n\u201cThe number one criterion is safety. And secondly, that they were willing to partner with us, in secrecy, so we could have planes on demand when required.\u201d\n\nWhile the aircraft were deployed around Europe, CAA staff were redeployed around the office. An operations room was set up in the library. Screens show the schedule and the status of every flight in the pop-up fleet.\n\nThomas Cook had both long- and short-haul flights, and some of the latter were to tricky locations \u2013 such as the Greek island of Skiathos, with a short and difficult runway. \"You can\u2019t just put any old plane in there,\u201d says Cohen.\n\nBecause no airline is any use unless passengers turn up to fly on it, a team was set up to grind through the data from Thomas Cook about which passengers were expecting to fly on which routes, and when.\n\nEvery whiteboard in Whitehall, it seems, has been requisitioned by the CAA for this complex operation. Most are decorated with hieroglyphics containing the alphabet of airport codes from AGP (Malaga) to ZTH (Zakinthos), numbers of \u201cpax\u201d (passengers) and notes such as \u201c4 TC staff\u201d.\n\nCivil service staff from Whitehall \u2013 the Foreign Office and the Department for Transport \u2013 have been requisitioned too. They are embedded in the CAA HQ, to provide support \u2013 which proved invaluable when hotels in Cuba started demanding that Thomas Cook holidaymakers paid again.\n\nIn the first few days of Operation Matterhorn, the CAA had contacted all 3,000 Thomas Cook hotels around the world and explained that they would be getting paid for the current guests.\n\nBut the message wasn\u2019t always received well by property owners who are unlikely to be paid for the key months of July and August. One hotel on the Riviera Maya in Mexico is said to be owned \u00a32m by Thomas Cook.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got every right to be grumpy,\u201d says Dame Deirdre Hutton, \u201cBut holding our passengers hostage is not the answer.\u201d\n\nAt call centres in Gateshead and Glasgow, calls began coming in by the thousand. Meanwhile on the social media desk, messages were targeted on key resorts to alert holidaymakers to the Thomas Cook collapse and direct them to the official website, thomascook.caa.co.uk.\n\nMost incoming calls and messages are routine, seeking reassurance that what is promised on the website will actually happen.\n\nBut tricky cases are sent to the \u201cEscalations\u201d team at the CAA: for example people in the UK calling to ensure that older relatives needing special assistance would be looked after, or travellers with electric wheelchairs wanting certainty that their precious mobility aid would be able to travel safely with them.\n\nIn any large population of holidaymakers, there is a regular incidence of problems: people who need to come back early because of a family emergency; illness that delays a trip home; and the disorganised or confused traveller who misses their flight. In the absence of Thomas Cook, all of these cases become the concerns of the staff at the CAA.\n\nAs does Rocky, a large rescue dog currently on the island of Fuerteventura in the Canaries. (To be clear, Rocky is not helping in the rescue operation but was rescued by a British couple who are now trying to take him home with them.) So far, the quest has defeated even the CAA team on the Isle of Dogs.\n\nIn the second week of Operation Matterhorn, the challenge has moved from sheer scale to managing capacity efficiently. Because Thomas Cook holidaymakers on one-week breaks did not travel out from Monday 23 September onwards, they do not need to be brought back. Fewer than half as many holidaymakers will be flown home in week two, but many of them are touching down at unfamiliar airports.\n\nOn Sunday 6 October, for example, passengers booked on Thomas Cook flights from Palma to Bristol, Gatwick and Glasgow will arrive at Manchester.\n\n\u201cGenerally we make people go to the middle of the country,\u201d says Andy Cohen.\n\nTop CAA executives have left their desks and are currently stationed at big British airports \u2013 Gatwick, Birmingham and Manchester in particular. They are helping passengers who have touched down on the right day in the right country, but who need to be bussed to their final destinations (or, in the case of Belfast, booked on easyJet or other airlines \u2013 at the CAA\u2019s expense).\n\nAt the bus station at Manchester airport this week, a gentleman who had just stepped off a bus from Birmingham airport stopped me to say: \u201cI think the government\u2019s doing a fantastic job. Make sure you report that.\u201d Another passenger told me: \u201cI think it\u2019s worked miraculously.\u201d\n\nIn any airline, whether long-established or only 12 days old, stuff happens: a wheel needed to be flown from Paris to Cancun in Mexico for a grounded Airbus A380; an earthquake in Istanbul interrupted services at Antalya in Turkey; and thunderstorms in southeast Europe on Thursday wrought havoc with Greek flights.\n\nPerhaps inevitably travellers who encounter problems are far more likely to pipe up than those who have had smooth journeys.\n\nOne passenger, Norman McLeod, relates his experience coming back from Kalamata in the Greek Peloponnese: \u201cThe CAA sent an aircraft with 180 seats to collect 290 passengers. We were consequently bumped, sent to a hotel overnight together with a further 30 bumped off a Manchester flight.\n\n\u201cWe eventually arriving back at Birmingham 27 hours late, at 11pm, on an Air Malta-liveried aircraft staffed by DAT Scandinavian personnel who had been sitting in Gatwick from 10am not knowing where they were going.\u201d\n\nCohen says: \u201cWe have our moments and we make mistakes. But the key to it is that when we make mistakes we rectify them and learn from them.\n\n\u201cThe data we received from the company was not as we would like it, which gave us extra difficulties. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen for a company of this size.\u201d\n\nRather than a centralised register of everyone booked aboard Thomas Cook Airlines between 23 September and 6 October, staff had to trawl through 150 different reservation systems to identify the 150,000-plus travellers who were believed to be abroad with the holiday firm.\n\nDame Deirdre tells of two elderly women who happened to be abroad with Monarch at the time of that firm\u2019s collapse, and found themselves two years later being repatriated once more as Thomas Cook customers.\n\n\u201cBecause they had travelled with us before, they were very relaxed and comfortable.\u201d Then she goes off to check her team are relaxed and comfortable. A masseur is in the building on Friday afternoon, and a bowl of fruit or a bag of sweets is never far from reach.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re asking people to go above and beyond, you\u2019ve got to keep them going.\u201d\n\nThe actual customer of Operation Matterhorn is the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who says he is \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of the CAA response: \u201cThe collapse of Thomas Cook presented us with a challenge of unprecedented scale.\n\n\u201cSo far we have brought more than 130,000 people home but the job\u2019s not finished yet. We are working hard to get everyone back as quickly as possible during this difficult period.\u201d\n\nOnce the \u201cdifficult period\u201d is over, there will be many questions about why the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of travellers have been disrupted twice in two years \u2013 and why nothing has apparently changed in the government\u2019s approach to failing airlines.\n\nPassengers touching down at Manchester airport will see the Thomas Cook Airlines HQ and a row of planes parked outside it. Hundreds of Thomas Cook cabin crew and flight crew are currently available for duty, because they were not expecting to lose their jobs.\n\nAfter the Monarch collapse two years ago, everyone agreed it would be a good idea to keep a failing airline aloft for long enough to recover passengers and close down gently, rather than spending a fortune assembling a \u201cshadow\u201d carrier that is never going to be a perfect match.\n\nBut it would require some uncontentious legislation to be passed, to allow aircraft from an airline that is technically bankrupt to continue flying, and to provide protection from creditors. And as you may have noticed, the government\u2019s attention has been elsewhere for the past few years.\n\nOperation Matterhorn is expected to cost \u00a3100m; \u00a360m will be met by the Atol fund, but the remainder is picked up by the taxpayer.\n\nDame Deirdre has one final observation. \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, we never, ever want to do this again.\u201d", "description": "\u201cTwelve hour shifts, no weekends, doing something you\u2019ve never done before\u201d \u2013 that, says Dame Deirdre Hutton, was part of the job description for Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) staff working on Operation Matterhorn.
