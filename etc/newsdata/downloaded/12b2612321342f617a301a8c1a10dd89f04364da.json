I can assure you there was no quid pro quo.\" pic.twitter.com/M1g62vje4r \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) October 23, 2019\n\nWhat\u2019s up with that? Can a quid pro quo really be that subjective? Or are Republicans denying reality?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the new \u2018no collusion,\u2019\u201d said Jessica Levinson, a law professor a Loyola University in Los Angeles.\n\nIt\u2019s also the red line many Republicans have drawn on whether to stand by Trump, perhaps fully aware it\u2019s hard to prove.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSure. I mean \u2026 show me something that \u2026 is a crime,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) to Axios on HBO in an interview last week. \u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing.\u201d\n\nI called Levinson up for some clarity on the legal definition of a quid pro quo and how that fits into the current political debate. She made three main points:\n\nAD\n\n1) It\u2019s not that the term quid pro quo is subjective, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s hard to prove in a court of law. That makes it subjective in the political realm, where lawmakers can take advantage of that fact. \u201cWhat happens in real life is in lead-up to the phone call [between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president], which is [that] everybody knows that military aid is on the line, and with that knowledge, you go into the phone call and say: \u2018I really want something from you,\u2019\u201d Levinson said. \u201cBut you never say both parts of the sentence, which is \u2018you want something from me, and I want something from you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPolitically, that means lawmakers can move the goal posts of the definition of a quid pro quo. It\u2019s so extreme to explicitly ask for something in return for something that it seldom happens in real life, or even in those mobster movies. That gives folks like Graham extra security to say: I do have a limit for what Trump does \u2014 it\u2019s a clear quid pro quo. They likely know it never happened.\n\n2) Talking about a quid pro quo risks missing the point of whether Trump broke the rules. This was Levinson\u2019s main point. Sometimes quid pro quos are necessary and even good in governing, she said. You wouldn\u2019t want to give taxpayer money to a country that is going to squander it corruptly, so a president might try to hold up funds until a country cleans up its act. But asking for a political favor is where it probably crosses the line.\n\nAD\n\nStill, Washington is getting caught up on whether it crosses the line into a clear quid pro quo. That\u2019s because even if you don\u2019t have a clear quid pro quo (and Taylor shared secondhand conversations that sound very much like there was one), getting reelection help from a foreign government is illegal. It might even be a campaign finance violation.\n\nAD\n\nWe could step back even further and point out that all this talk about crimes somewhat beside the point in the impeachment debate: Trump doesn\u2019t even have to have committed a crime to get impeached. Congress could decide what he did is just plain wrong as the nation\u2019s leader. The Constitution allows for subjectivity on that, too.\n\n3) There\u2019s one big misconception out there about quid pro quos that people are using to defend Trump: that you have to carry it through for it to have happened.\n\nAD\n\nAs it becomes clearer that Trump did try to exchange military aid and/or an Oval Office meeting to get a foreign country to investigate Democrats, this is one argument we expect to hear more of from Trump\u2019s defenders. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal editorial board said this:\n\n\u201c \u2026 [I]t may turn out that while Mr. Trump wanted a quid-pro-quo policy ultimatum toward Ukraine, he was too inept to execute it. Impeachment for incompetence would disqualify most of the government, and most Presidents at some point or another in office.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s inaccurate, at least legally.\n\n\u201cAn attempt is enough,\u201d Levinson said. \u201cThe point isn\u2019t whether you were successful, it\u2019s whether you tried.\u201d\n\nSo Trump doesn\u2019t have to have been successful on his quid pro quo to be accused of one. He doesn\u2019t have to be caught explicitly offering a quid pro quo to be accused of one. And he doesn\u2019t even have to have been found committing a quid pro quo to get impeached.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump doesn\u2019t even have to have been found committing a quid pro quo to get impeached.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8b2j6yHE5elc6y8SyjZAbf3v91M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WKTEP7HKXYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
