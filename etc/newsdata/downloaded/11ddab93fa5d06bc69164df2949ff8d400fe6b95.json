Replace them with primaries.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-02", "text": "Caucuses typically occur at a set time and can last for hours, during which attendees may be expected to participate in an organized discussion or cast their votes publicly. Byzantine rules govern them, and horse-trading is common. Unsurprisingly, only the committed turn out. Research shows that substantially fewer people show up to caucuses than to primaries. And those who do tend toward the ideological fringe, relative to primary voters. Caucuses therefore tend to favor more extreme candidates. Despite complaints that the Democratic Party\u2019s nominating system was rigged for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential cycle, the caucus system in fact favored Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nFor some voters, caucuses are simply exclusionary. They make it hard for night-shift workers or the disabled to have their say. That\u2019s plainly inequitable.\n\nSensitive to these criticisms, the DNC changed its rules after the 2016 nominating cycle, encouraging primaries and requiring caucus states to make it easier to participate. Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, Utah and Washington state have switched from caucus systems to primaries for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIowa and Nevada, both of which hold their nominating events in February, are the key early states that have refused to switch. So state Democratic officials have tried to figure out ways to make them fairer. Iowa Democrats would have allowed people to register in advance and obtain a PIN they could enter as they called in to cast their vote. Iowans would have had six opportunities to call in. The system would have been tested during the fall. But national party officials worried that it would be too risky, particularly in the wake of Russia\u2019s 2016 election-hacking campaign. \u201cWhile only five months remain before the caucuses, we will explore what alternatives may exist to securely increase accessibility from previous years given the time allowed,\u201d Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price said Friday.\n\nWhy make such an effort to preserve an unjustifiable system? It is time to end nominating caucuses once and for all.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Democrats need more democracy\n\nPaul Waldman: The presidential caucus needs to die\n\nMax Boot: My day at the Iowa State Fair reaffirmed a little of my battered faith in America\n\nPaul Waldman: The Iowa State Fair is everything that\u2019s wrong with presidential politics\n\nJennifer Rubin: Why Iowa is so important this time", "description": "Bending over backwards to shore up the old-fashioned, exclusionary system makes no sense.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GWF5FYWLHQI6TPQF65VMJ3DBRQ.jpg"}
