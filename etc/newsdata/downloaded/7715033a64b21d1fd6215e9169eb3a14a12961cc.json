Mislav Orsic stepped up to score the spot kick.\n\nHowever, it was Shakhtar\u2019s turn to level through Brazilian right-back Dodo in the 75th minute.\n\nDinamo ended a 13-game losing run in European away games but could have taken the win, with Olmo twice hitting the post in the second half.\n\nA win for either team would have given it a strong hold of the second qualifying spot in Group C since Italian side Atalanta, which plays Manchester City later, lost both of its opening two games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Shakhtar Donetsk salvaged a 2-2 draw with Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Tuesday as both teams failed to gain a clear grip on second place in Group C.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
