Fiji crossed again moments later, but scrumhalf Frank Lomani's try was also scratched by the TMO after a forward pass.\n\nWorse was to come for Wales when hooker Ken Owens was yellow-carded in the eighth minute for flipping number eight Viliame Mata on his back in an ugly tackle.\n\nThe barnstorming Semi Radradra, named player of the match, made Wales pay at once, setting up a try for fullback Kini Murimurivalu in the right corner.\n\nFlyhalf Ben Volavola failed to covert either try, however, and Fiji's gains were further squandered by lock Tevita Cavubati who was yellow-carded for a shoulder charge in the 17th minute.\n\nBiggar wasted no time setting up Wales' first try with a sumptuous cross-kick to Adams. Wales' forwards then ramped up the pressure and Fiji's scrambling defense was soon on the brink of collapse.\n\nFlanker Semi Kunatani saw yellow for a fourth off-side penalty and soon after Adams was strolling over for his second five-pointer as the Welsh sliced open Fiji's threadbare right flank.\n\nFiji were fortunate to trail by only four points at 14-10 at the break but blew a chance to retake the lead in the 49th minute with another forward pass disallowing a try for Radradra.\n\nBIGGAR WORRY\n\nThe game turned on its head minutes later, however, as Davies was yellow-carded for a ruck infringement.\n\nFiji kicked for the corner, rumbled a lineout drive to the line and were awarded a penalty try after Wales collapsed the maul.\n\nA shudder went through the Welsh crowd when Liam Williams clattered into Biggar as both attempted to catch a clearing kick. After several minutes of medical attention, Biggar groggily got to his feet and jogged off the field.\n\nHis replacement Rhys Patchell stepped up to slot a 42-meter penalty and minutes later Adams had his hat-trick, again at the corner following a stunning linebreak by Davies.\n\nFiji provided plenty of highlights but were guilty of a defensive blunder late on as scrumhalf Gareth Davies cantered through a hole to set up Williams for the sealing try.\n\n(Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Tony Lawrence)", "description": "By Ian RansomOITA, Japan Oct 9 (Reuters) - Winger Josh Adams grabbed a hat-trick of tries as a battered and bruised Wales battled to a 29-17 bonus-point win...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
