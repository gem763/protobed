A new case of dementia is diagnosed every three seconds. Annual costs for treating dementia are already $1 trillion and rising. And if you are over the age of 65, your risk of developing dementia\n\ndoubles every year. This is not to be confused with Alzheimer\u2019s disease . Dementia is a general term for a severe decline in cognitive ability. Alzheimer\u2019s is a specific disease in which dementia is the prominent symptom. As many as 40% of dementia cases aren\u2019t caused by Alzheimer\u2019s, and many have signature symptoms and features:(dementia as a result of a stroke) comes on nearly as quick as a stroke. Cognitive deficits follow a step-like pattern instead of a gradual decline.is caused by accumulation of proteins that develop in the areas of the brain that control your thinking and movement. These proteins are often found in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, and symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson\u2019s disease. These overlaps make it difficult to accurately diagnose Lewy body dementia.is a group of related conditions caused by gradual degeneration of your temporal and frontal lobes of your brain. These parts of your pain are crucial for emotional and behavioral control, decision making, and language. Loss of these skills are signature symptoms of frontotemporal dementiadevelops lightning fast \u2013 sometimes within weeks and months \u2013 and has a host of possible causes: developing an autoimmune disease, vitamin deficiencies, infections, reduced blood flow to brain, exposure to toxic substances (including prescribed medications) and more. And that\u2019s just a short list. It\u2019s likely that someone you love is at risk for developing dementia, perhaps even you. But I have some good news: We know what causes many forms of dementia and many of them are preventable.\n\nRecognizing the Signs of Dementia\n\nPreventing Dementia One Plate at a Time\n\nI consider dementia the Trojan Horse of modern times. The causes of dementia are right in front of us and we allow them into our bodies. But there\u2019s one difference between the sack of Troy and the onset of dementia: It takes decades for most forms of dementia to set in. In that time, the symptoms of dementia \u2013 memory loss, poor judgment, difficulty keeping track of things, mood fluctuations, withdrawal, and more \u2013 can surface. But you may not notice them or you write them off as something else: fatigue, dehydration, aging. However, you have a big advantage over dementia. Time is on your side to prevent it, but the time to start is now. You have another advantage that people 5 years ago didn\u2019t have. And you can thank Dr. Dale Bredesen for that. His groundbreaking 2014 research took a person-specific approach to recognizing and treating dementia. For each patient, he took multiple blood tests and cognitive evaluations and then implemented (and tweaked) treatments based on results. He focused on hormone levels, sleep, exercise, brain stimulation levels, vitamin levels, gastrointestinal health, antioxidant levels, and much more. I strongly urge you to read more about his work. It\u2019s truly fascinating. Prevention of all forms of dementia is generally the same. I divide preventative practices into four main categories: Nutrition, Lifestyle, Supplements, and Drug Interaction.Let\u2019s talk about what you should eat. Your body is different from everyone else\u2019s, but you probably don\u2019t know exactly how. A nutritional panel gives you critical information about what your specific nutrient needs, much more targeted than the general advice I can give in a newsletter. A comprehensive nutritional panel will reveal nutritional deficiencies \u2013 proteins, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. It also reveals your total blood count and metabolic profile. Armed with that information, you can create an optimized dementia diet. Perhaps you need more vitamin D\u2026perhaps you need more\n\n100% whole grains\n\nComplex carbohydrates\n\nAim for 5 - 10 servings of vegetables a day. The greener the better.\n\nHealthy fats such as nuts, seeds, avocado, and olive oil\n\nLean proteins such as legumes, chicken, and fish\n\nLow glycemic fruit like berries\n\nProcessed foods\n\nMore than two servings of meat a day. Aim for one.\n\nRefined carbohydrates like white or non-whole-grain bread, crackers, pasta and pastries\n\nAdded sugars and high-fructose corn syrup\n\nThe Top 5 Lifestyle Habits of Dementia Prevention\n\nB12 (a common source of dementia symptoms) . Only a nutritional panel can tell you. On top of that, I suggest you follow some basic dietary do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s of dementia prevention: DO eat:DON\u2019T eat:A healthy diet keeps your blood pressure and cholesterol in check \u2013 which is critical to prevent a stroke and vascular dementia.I cannot understate the value of a healthy lifestyle. Not just for preventing dementia, but all forms of disease. A \u201chealthy lifestyle\u201d can mean a lot of different things, so to make things simple, I pared it down to five dementia fighters:, andA 2017 study found that people who get less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep have a greater risk of developing dementia. Separately, a 2018 study found that being physically fit decreases your risk of developing dementia. And it doesn\u2019t take another scientific study to tell you that regular exercise helps you sleep better. In fact, just a little exercise today will help you sleep better tonight. You don\u2019t need to run a marathon or bench press your own body weight. But going for a brisk walk, every evening after dinner, could work wonders.\n\nChronic stress is common for dementia patients prior to their diagnosis. Stress doesn\u2019t outright cause dementia but it plays an important role. When you experience stress, your body releases the hormone cortisol. Many studies link elevated cortisol levels with learning and memory problems, lower immunity, thinner bone density, weight gain, higher blood pressure and cholesterol, and greater risk of heart disease. Reducing your daily stress is critical for preventing dementia. And there are dozens of ways to do it. My favorite stress busters are exercise, enjoying my favorite hobbies, reading, and mindful meditation. But you might try yoga, tai chi, massage, talking with friends or family members\u2014even therapy is an excellent stress reducer.You may not think of playing cards, board games, crossword puzzles, and suduko as \u201chealthy\u201d activities. But all that thinking and strategizing keeps your brain operating in high-gear \u2013 forming new neural connections and preserving older ones. Lifelong learning, particularly learning in areas where you don\u2019t already have experience, is the equivalent of exercise for your brain.Finally, studies suggest that weekly fasting can delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease by slowing down your body\u2019s aging process. This seems promising for other forms of dementia, as well. By fasting, I\u2019m not talking going days without food \u2013 more like 16 to 24 hours of reduced calorie intake or full fasting. When you think about it, 16 hours from evening to morning isn\u2019t that long if you include 8 hours of sleep within that time frame. Fasting can also prevent diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nSupplements that Boost Your Brain Power\n\nStacks of research show that curcumin, omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFA), and vitamin B12 are bona fide dementia fighters.Protein accumulation, oxidative damage, and inflammation are the hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases. Curcumin can prevent aggregation of proteins, flush potent toxins and free radicals, and stop and prevent inflammation. It\u2019s the ideal dementia fighter. I recommend 1,500 mg over the course of the day.Numerous studies show that omega-3 essential fatty acids can prevent and reduce the progression of dementia associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but it fights off other forms of dementia too. One of its acids in particular, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), protects you from other dementia risk factors like head trauma, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. I recommend up to 3,000 mg of the omega-3 EFAs per day. Be a label reader! Make sure the combined EPA and DHA content specifically is at least 1,000 mg or more. Research also suggests that DHA is more effective when taken in conjunction with antioxidants.Numerous studies have linked diets deficient in vitamin B12 with increased risk of depression and cognitive impairment \u2013 especially among people over the age of 50. In fact, many cases of dementia are actually long-undiagnosed B12 deficiencies. Adding to this, your body does not absorb B12 as well as you get older. I know I talk a LOT about eating plenty of vegetables per day, but many of them lack B12. Focus on greens if you are trying to get B12 from plant sources \u2013 spinach, broccoli, green peas, asparagus, and turnip greens. But animal proteins like meat, milk and cheese are the most plentiful source of vitamin B12. But I recommend taking 6 mcg of a B12 supplement daily so you don\u2019t have to overthink what\u2019s on your plate every day.\n\nDrugs Linked to Dementia\n\nA Fighting Chance\n\nReferences\n\nFinally, a growing body of research links anticholinergic drugs to increased risk for dementia. These drugs are commonly prescribed for urinary incontinence, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, depression, allergies, sleeping problems, and asthma. And they work by decreasing overactive gut activity, reducing production of digestive juices, and altering the production of neurotransmitters. Apparently, though, they work too well. An April 2018 study of 40,000 people found \u201ca robust association between some classes of anticholinergic drugs and future dementia.\u201d The anticholinergic drugs in particular were anti-Parkinson\u2019s Disease medication, quetiapine (Seroquel), and medications to curb overactive bladder. If you are prescribed anticholinergic medications, I suggest that you talk with your doctor about finding alternatives that do not carry as much risk.Ten years ago, I couldn\u2019t write the following sentence with confidence: There\u2019s a wealth of knowledge readily available to you that can treat and prevent dementia. And it\u2019s growing by the day. That gives me hope in the face of those grim dementia statistics \u2013 that millions of people at risk for dementia now have a fighting chance to delay it, blunt it, or prevent it outright.", "description": "I don\u2019t get scared very easily, but this statistic is .09/02/2019 2:59:59AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
