While Zellweger may lack much of Garland\u2019s vocal prowess, she makes up for it in sheer moxie; her renditions of \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d and \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d are riveting.\n\nOf course, the film would be far less effective without its intimate moments too. One of the most poignant scenes depicts Garland meeting a gay couple, Dan and Stan (played by Andy Nyman and Daniel Cerqueira), who wait for their idol to exit the stage door after a concert. Through an unlikely series of events, Garland winds up at the couple\u2019s apartment, where a night of revelry ends with an emotional discussion of how the two men find comfort in her music and films while maintaining their relationship amid legal and social persecution.\n\nThe scene, which appears about halfway through the film and has been singled out in numerous reviews, is very much an allegory. While Dan and Stan are fictional, they stand in for the legions of LGBTQ fans who embraced Garland during her career peaks \u2014 from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to \u201cA Star is Born\u201d and, later, live at Carnegie Hall \u2014 and stuck by the star as her private bouts of depression and drug addiction became more pronounced.\n\nFor many of those admirers, the connection was personal in more ways than one. Many historians believe \u201cfriend of Dorothy,\u201d a code term used to explain that a man is gay that became popular in the mid-20th century, was inspired by Garland.\n\nDavid Hindley/Roadside Attractions In \"Judy,\" Judy Garland (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) is shown comforting a gay devotee, Dan (Andy Nyman).\n\nFor Nyman, the scene\u2019s aim was twofold: to relay the oppression members of the LGBTQ community had experienced in 1960s England to a modern audience, and to draw a connection between those challenges and the ones many encounter in today\u2019s political climate.\n\n\u201cIn the past five years, we\u2019ve had dramatic changes in our ability to talk about things like world politics, gender politics,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201c[Until recently] it felt like you could sit down and chat politics with people of opposing views. A conversation would ensue, and that would be the end of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a place now where you\u2019re walking on eggshells and want to avoid those conversations,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to presume everyone thinks the way you do, until you discover, \u2018Holy shit, they voted for Brexit,\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, my God, does that mean they voted for Trump?\u2019 I find that very parallels the world of suppression, illegality and fear that [LGBTQ people] were experiencing in England back then.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudy\u201d wisely steers clear of addressing Garland\u2019s fabled, oft-contested connection to the 1969 Stonewall uprising \u2014 the symbolic start of the modern day LGBTQ rights movement \u2014 altogether.\n\nThe \u201cJudy myth\u201d nods to the fact that the riots took place in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village neighborhood on the morning of June 28, 1969. less than 24 hours after Garland\u2019s funeral service was held in the city. Some have suggested Garland\u2019s death resonated so deeply among LGBTQ fans, it inspired those at Stonewall to stand up to a police raid.\n\nDavid Hindley/Roadside Attractions Zellweger, as Garland, performs a powerful rendition of \"The Trolley Song\" in a scene from \"Judy.\"\n\nOf course, both the 50th anniversary of Garland\u2019s death and Stonewall this year serve as a reminder of the great social strides since the time depicted in the film.\n\nDan alludes to missing Garland\u2019s 1964 performances at London\u2019s Palladium because Stan was serving six months in jail for obscenity. The fact that the pair would be able to attend concerts together just four years later is accurate: The Sexual Offenses Act of 1967 decriminalized homosexual acts in the U.K.\n\nAs for his take on Garland\u2019s enduring appeal to the LGBTQ community, Nyman said, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret she was troubled and her journey was difficult. You hear it in the music \u2014 you\u2019re not just getting something vanilla. There\u2019s no filter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a level of vulnerability that speaks to people who feel like outsiders,\u201d he added. \u201c\u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019 for instance, is a dreamlike fairy tale with a happy ending. At the heart of it is cruelty and lack of acceptance, but its message is ultimately, \u2018Be who you are, the world will accept you.\u2019 How can that fail to speak to the LGBTQ community?\u201d\n\nSandra Vijandi Nyman is also slated to appear in Disney's \"Jungle Cruise,\" due out in 2020.\n\nNyman, whose credits include \u201cKick-Ass 2\u201d and Disney\u2019s forthcoming \u201cJungle Cruise,\u201d also relished working with Zellweger, calling her \u201cfucking amazing\u201d both on-screen and off.\n\n\u201cIt was remarkable to see Ren\u00e9e arrive, and bit by bit, there would be Judy,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would transform herself physically \u2014 I felt like I was doing those scenes with Judy, and that made my job 1,000 times easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s utterly collaborative,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo bullshit. Just wants to act and do it truthfully and well. It\u2019s a phenomenal piece of work from a brilliant actress who is, at times, underrated. And that\u2019s a really interesting parallel with Judy.\u201d", "description": "The Judy Garland biopic, starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, examines its subject's connection with her LGBTQ fans \u2014 and hints at why that bond endures today.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93d0f02100006901513d00.jpeg?cache=6r94m1q7to&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
