What I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office,\u201d said Biden. \u201cOn the 17 \u2014 look, the fact George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president, that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our election,\u201d Biden said as he oddly diverted from his initial thought.\n\nERIC TRUMP BLASTS HUNTER BIDEN OVER 'RAMPANT CORRUPTION'\n\nUpon playing this clip, Noah immediately mocked the former vice president.\n\n\u201cOkay, one minute he\u2019s talking about his son, then it\u2019s George Washington then something about the 17?\" Noah asked, wondering why Biden's response was so frenetic. \"Joe Biden is the only candidate who remixes his speech while he\u2019s giving it,\u201d Noah said before imitating sounds of a record scratching.\n\nThe controversy behind Hunter Biden stems from when the son of the former vice president accepted a lucrative position to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nINGRAHAM: 'SWAMPINESS OF THE BIDEN'S' REMINDS AMERICANS WHY THEY VOTED FOR TRUMP\n\nThe 49-year-old son of former Vice President Joe Biden told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, \"poor judgment.\"\n\n\u201cI know I did nothing wrong at all.

What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea,\" he said, claiming that the allegations of impropriety have been \"debunked by everyone.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah laid into former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden Tuesday night after his strange response to a rather pressing question.
