And the better the apartment, the better the return is likely to be.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a view that\u2019s shared by Scott Kuru, the co-founder of Freedom Property Investors, who has accumulated 13 investment properties in six years. He believes that often people budget and try to save money on a new investment apartment, when they should be stretching themselves to buy the very best they can.\n\n\u201cIf you can afford to buy into an iconic building like Central Park or in Barangaroo, or a penthouse or sub-penthouse, that\u2019s what you should be doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next four years, 4 million Baby Boomers will be downsizing and looking for quality property.\n\n\u201cThere are also the investors from China and India and America who are looking for renowned, globally iconic buildings or bigger apartments. With so many more potential buyers, the resale value is always going to be higher.\u201d\n\nGlobally iconic buildings like Sydney\u2019s Central Park can attract overseas buyers.\n\nWhere should you buy?\n\nLocation is as important as it\u2019s ever been, and the joy of an apartment is living close to amenities like parks, beaches or waterways, schools, work, public transport and cafes, restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cYou should also choose an area that has a limited supply of new apartments because there\u2019s then less competition when you come to re-sell,\u201d said Tim Rees, senior director of residential projects in Sydney with CBRE.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarrickville appealed to Mr Sergeant, for instance, precisely because of its lack of cranes on the skyline and a local council very strict on new development as well as its popularity and potential for further price growth.\n\nMr Sergeant bought an apartment in the Marrick + Co development as an investment.\n\nIt\u2019s important to check the neighbourhood too. \u201cYou have to check on future projects nearby,\u201d said real estate author and buyers agent Patrick Bright, director of EPS Property Search.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen many developments where a development next door takes the view.\u201d\n\nAnd while transport links are important, you don\u2019t want to be too close to them, warns Anna Porter, property valuer and principal of property advisors Suburbanite.\n\n\u201cThere can be problems if you\u2019re too close to a train station, as it might attract riffraff or kids hanging around and there might be vandalism or cars being broken into.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of building should you buy into?\n\nIt can be wise to favour smaller buildings over big \u2013 unless there are great views or something special about the high rise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn a big building, you might always have three or four apartments for sale at the same time, and then it becomes a race to the bottom on price,\u201d said Mr Bright.\n\nOwner-occupiers also tend to favour smaller buildings, Mr Rees adds. \u201cThey also tend to choose apartments by a developer with a strong reputation and with higher quality. They like entry lobbies, too, that look higher quality \u2013 that\u2019s much more important these days \u2013 and that look good on the ground plane with nice gardens.\u201d\n\nThe building shouldn\u2019t have too many facilities like pools and spas and gyms which can frighten some people off with the spectre of larger strata levies, advises Ms Porter. \u201cBut it should have parking. With more and more cars on the road, more congestion and less street parking, that\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nBefore buying, you should check that the strata levies look right for the building, and not artificially low for the beginning period when it still has warranties disguising the true cost of running the place, Mr Bright says.\n\nAnd given concerns around cladding and cracking in some apartments, the developer and builders\u2019 past records should also be checked. Mr Sergeant even asked for a certificate to confirm the cladding had a good fire rating and looked into the certifier.\n\nWhat kind of apartment should you choose?\n\nIdeally, there should be something a little different about your apartment, something that gives it a unique selling point. That might be size or a view, or having a courtyard or bigger outdoor area. \u201cThe lack of supply of those kinds of apartments will stand you in good stead,\u201d said Mr Bright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the apartment should stand out from the others, it shouldn\u2019t be too quirky. \u201cThose different features should still give it broad appeal,\u201d said Ms Porter. \u201cNot everyone will appreciate an unusual-shaped study, so it still has to be attractive to the most number of buyers, and having plenty of natural light is essential.\u201d\n\nPenthouses and apartments with views will stand out in a crowded market.\n\nBigger, well-designed apartments tend to appeal to downsizers as well as other buyers. \u201cBaby Boomers in particular want space,\u201d said Mr Kuru. \u201cBut then if a building has had a good architect and the apartments are well laid-out and designed, a 90 square metre apartment can feel like 120 square metres, and the reverse is true with a bad layout.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll always get a premium for views, too,\u201d Mr Kuru said. \u201cIf you\u2019re choosing between three or four apartments, spend a little more for a view. That will command a premium.\u201d\n\nAnd buy something you like, that others will too. \u201cIf you fall in love with something like a view,\u201d said Mr Rees, \u201cthen chances are that, when it comes to your resale, someone else will fall in love with it too.\u201d\n\nThis story first appeared at Domain.\n\ndomain.com.au", "description": "The first mistake most people make is thinking they should pay less than what the property they live in is worth, say experts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5174%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9a147aac79a68d24ebc3e77e15b9874a84522d18", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
