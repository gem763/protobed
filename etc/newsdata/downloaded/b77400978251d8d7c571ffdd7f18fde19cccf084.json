Before I jump into today\u2019s topic, let\u2019s catch up a bit. Last week, I wrote about All Raise\u2019s expansion, Uber the TV show and the unicorn from down under.\n\nRemember, you can send me tips, suggestions and feedback to kate.clark@techcrunch.com or on Twitter @KateClarkTweets. If you don\u2019t subscribe to Startups Weekly yet, you can do that here.\n\nThe SoftBank saga\n\nAccording to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, SoftBank plans to take a more conservative approach as it begins deploying capital from Vision Fund II. Why? The Japanese mega-fund\u2019s track record is less than stellar. Not only has it lost billions on WeWork, but several of its other portfolio companies are suffering through layoffs, mismanagement and more.\n\nFair.com, a startup building a flexible car ownership business that is valued at $1.2 billion \u2014 backed by some $500 million in equity from SoftBank and others, plus billions more dollars in debt funding \u2014 said this week that it will be laying off 40% of its staff. On top of this, it\u2019s removing its CFO, Tyler Painter, the brother of the CEO and co-founder (and car business veteran) Scott Painter. He\u2019s being replaced in the interim by Kirk Shryoc. Read more from TechCrunch\u2019s Ingrid Lunden.\n\nWeWork, the co-working giant we\u2019re all too familiar with at this point, has benefited from $18.5 billion from SoftBank, according to Marcelo Claure, a SoftBank executive who\u2019s speech to WeWork employees was leaked to Recode this week. \u201cWe have guaranteed the future of WeWork, but more importantly is we\u2019re putting the future back into our hands. There\u2019s no more days needed to go fundraising \u2026The size of the commitment that SoftBank has made to this company in the past and now is $18.5 billion. To put the things in context, that is bigger than the GDP of my country where I came from. That\u2019s a country where there\u2019s 11 million people.\u201d Now nearly every single WeWork investor, particularly SoftBank, is entirely under water.\n\nThere\u2019s more where that came from. Brandless, another \u2026 star of SoftBank\u2019s portfolio, has struggled greatly with layoffs and a CEO shake-up, according to The Information. The dog-walking startup Wag raised $300 million from SoftBank, has also endured layoffs and management changes, and has failed to protect the safety of its pets, per this great report from CNN. And Compass, a real estate unicorn, has lost its CFO, CMO and CTO in what\u2019s been labeled \u201cAnother SoftBank-Fueled Real Estate Exodus.\u201d\n\nMeet me in Berlin\n\nThe TechCrunch team is heading to Berlin again this year for our annual event, TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin, which brings together entrepreneurs and investors from across the globe. We announced the agenda this week, with leading founders including Away\u2019s Jen Rubio and UiPath\u2019s Daniel Dines on tap for great talks.

Buy tickets to the event here.\n\nVC deals\n\nEquity\n\nThis week, Alex was remote and I was in studio to chat about a new angel fund, the WeWork saga and Lime\u2019s losses. Listen to the latest episode here.\n\nEquity drops every Friday at 6:00 am PT, so subscribe to us on iTunes, Overcast and all the casts.\n\nStartup Spotlight\n\nBespoke Financial wants to provide cannabis businesses with the same kind of financial services that other businesses get, but that dispensaries and growers can\u2019t yet access.\n\nThe regulations around cannabis operations are so stringent at the local level \u2014 and so nebulous at the federal level \u2014 that national banks won\u2019t give businesses in the cannabis industry the same basic services (like short-term loans).\n\nThat\u2019s why one former Goldman Sachs banker has partnered with two entrepreneurs from the traditional agriculture industry to create Bespoke Financial. And it\u2019s why the company has raised $7 million in financing led by Casa Verde Capital \u2014 the investment firm launched by legendary cannabis aficionado, Calvin Broadus (AKA Snoop Dogg).
