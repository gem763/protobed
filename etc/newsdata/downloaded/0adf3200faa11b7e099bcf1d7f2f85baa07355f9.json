It raises new questions about the president\u2019s handling of sensitive information and may further strain his relationship with U.S. spy agencies. One former official said the communication was a phone call\u2026\n\nIntelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson determined that the complaint was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of \u201curgent concern,\u201d a legal threshold that ordinarily requires notification of congressional oversight committees.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security Trumps-Communications-With-Foreign-Leader-Are-Part-Of-Whistleblower-Complaint-That-Spurred-Standoff-Between-Spy-Chief-And-Congress-Former-Officials-Say"], "top_image": ""}
