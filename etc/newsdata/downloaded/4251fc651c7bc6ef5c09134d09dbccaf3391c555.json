The challenge for him here is delivering two roles, one of which is significantly younger \u2013 think 51 vs 23 years of age \u2013 using the latest CGI dots-on-your-face-and-the-tech-guys-will-sort-it-later VFX. The resulting Fresh Prince-era Will Smith is a mixed bag, with the overall look a moderate success but certain specific details failing to deliver. There\u2019s a slight upper lip blurring you might remember from Henry Cavill\u2019s infamous moustache removal blooper during the Justice League reshoots, and that\u2019s not a good look.\n\nThe performances are pretty good all round, with Benedict Wong\u2019s cigar-chomping pilot pal Baron probably the stand-out \u2013 there\u2019s a brief moment involving a toucan that\u2019s delightful \u2013 and Mary Elizabeth Winstead\u2019s Danny does a decent job as a fellow assassin on the run and Smith\u2019s kinda-sorta love interest (though the age gap does feel a little off). Clive Owen has no problems as the villain as ever, and everyone is more or less, well, fine. Damning them with faint praise? Well, maybe a bit.\n\nCertain action sequences are good fun, notably a motorbike fight between the Wills and some Budapest back and forth in some catacombs. When your director is Ang Lee and your producer is Jerry Bruckheimer, you\u2019d expect quality in the spectacle department. If you enjoy explosions, gun play and fistfights in a natty new framerate, the film is also screening in high frame rate IMAX 3D+ in certain cinemas.\n\nCons\n\nThe script was written in the \u201890s and it feels like it. This comes over like a Face/Off knock-off, an oddly flat and pedestrian high-concept sci-fi action thriller that isn\u2019t quite funny enough, dramatic or spectacular. Considering the talent involved, it\u2019s a reverse miracle that it\u2019s turned out this\u2026 bleh. The script has been kicking around for so long that directors including Tony Scott, Curtis Hanson and Joe Carnahan were all attached at some point, as were stars Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and Sean Connery. Twenty years in development hell is a long time, and with the film finally out, it\u2019s hard to work out why they saw it through. This is a film where I felt so disconnected from what was going on, I found myself counting the number of times Will Smith hugs someone. The final tally? Seven. Now you know.\n\nThere\u2019s a sense that the cart was leading the horse, technology-wise. The \u201cyouthification\u201d of Will Smith is impressive \u2013 we\u2019ll see similar work done on Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro for Scorsese\u2019s upcoming The Irishman \u2013 but it\u2019s not reason enough to make the movie, much like the high frame rate. It\u2019s a gimmick, a neat trick, but ultimately it's not enough. More time spent on making sense of the story and injecting more life into the characters would have gone so much further than a few more days tweaking Will Smith\u2019s forehead wrinkles.\n\nBenedict Wong\u2019s Baron can summon up a plane, a runway, whatever you need to fly across the planet as and when you need it, and honestly it\u2019s a headscratching plothole that is almost dumbfounding. So\u2026 we\u2019re going to go to all this trouble explaining how cloning can happen but we\u2019re going to dismiss lots of other basic stuff with a wave of a hand?\n\nOh, and if you\u2019re not a fan of product placement, definitely steer clear of this film, because there are some clanging \u201cWOULD YOU LIKE A BEER?\u201d moments.\n\nThree word review: Flat, flimsy, tired.", "description": "Considering the talent involved, it\u2019s a reverse miracle that it\u2019s turned out this\u2026 bleh", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07qtpyq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
