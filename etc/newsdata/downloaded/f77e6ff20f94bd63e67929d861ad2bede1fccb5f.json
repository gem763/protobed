The flow is the equivalent of around 500,000 barrels per day.\n\nIt is unclear where the cargoes will end up, but traders said that Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-run oil company Aramco is seeking to buy large volumes of refined oil products.\n\nEurope\u2019s exports of gasoline and blending components to Saudi Arabia averaged 60,000 bpd in the first five months of the year, according to data analytics firm Vortexa.\n\n\u201cA flurry of gasoline bookings that emerged this week for Europe to Middle East voyages could see more European gasoline make its way to Saudi Arabia,\u201d Vortexa said in a note.\n\nTraders said the rise in shipping bookings was related to a sharp increase in demand following attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure on Sept. 14, which knocked out around 1 million bpd of Saudi Arabia\u2019s refining capacity.\n\n(Graphic: Saudi Arabia's oil refineries png, here)\n\n(This version of the story fixes typo in headline)", "description": "Gasoline exports from Europe to the Middle East and Asia are set to surge this week after recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities crippled output at the kingdom's refineries.", "authors": ["Ron Bousso", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
