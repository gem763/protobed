The AP has agreed and will send a representative to the hearing.\n\n\u201cThe Associated Press stands by the reporting of correspondent Nataliya Vasilyeva,\u201d agency spokeswoman Lauren Easton said in a statement. \u201cAfter her story was published, AP listened to concerns from representatives from the Central Election Commission and agreed to issue a clarification to add details about why some independent candidates running for the city legislature in Moscow had been excluded.\n\n\u201cAt no time did AP indicate it would publish the video interview with the head of the CEC in its entirety, or publish a transcript,\u201d she said. \u201cAP intends to comply with a request from the Public Council for Press Complaints to work with them as a result of further complaints from the CEC and looks forward to a resolution.\u201d\n\nThe press council is a civil body for media self-regulation and dispute resolution.\n\nThe lawyer whom AP is consulting says its decisions are non-binding.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Associated Press has agreed to accept the jurisdiction of Russia's press council in a dispute between the news agency and the head of the country's elections commission.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
