Along with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) he even issued his own addendum dissenting from the official findings of the Republican majority, complaining that the Obama administration had \u201cstonewalled\u201d the committee by refusing to turn over key documents or allowing crucial witnesses to testify.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s interview, Pompeo said the House probe into the Benghazi attack treated Foggy Bottom more fairly, allowing State Department attorneys to listen to depositions and review transcripts of interviews after they were transcribed.\n\n\u201cThis is deeply troubling to me,\u201d Pompeo said, adding that the department has relayed these concerns to Democrats conducting the probe. \u201cBecause I have an obligation to protect the State Department. Not only [is it] classified information but private conversations that are confidential, are information we don\u2019t want in the hands of others. And we\u2019ve not been permitted to see what it is our former employees have told this committee.\u201d\n\nPompeo\u2019s criticisms echo the House Republicans\u2019 strategy in dealing with the inquiry: He is rapping Democrats for the manner in which they are conducting their investigations, but not directly addressing the substance of the probe.\n\nReps. Jordan, Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) \u2014 some of the president\u2019s top allies \u2014 have repeatedly complained about the private nature of the investigation. Gaetz and other Republicans have sought to attend impeachment hearings, even though they are not on the committees conducting the inquest. Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, has pushed Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold a vote to begin an impeachment probe, which would be largely ceremonial.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has made the State Department employees the star witnesses. Michael McKinley \u2014 a former top adviser to Pompeo who said he quit over Yovanovitch\u2019s firing \u2014 gave a deposition this week, as did U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordan Sondland, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary in charge of Ukraine. Yovanovitch appeared last week, and Kurt Volker, who recently resigned as special envoy to Ukraine, testified Wednesday.\n\nExecutive branch departments and agencies have uniformly rejected subpoenas and document requests from House Democrats. Nearly all of them \u2014 the State Department, the Pentagon, and the vice president\u2019s office \u2014 have pointed to a letter signed by White House counsel Pat Cipollone last week calling the impeachment inquiry illegitimate and vowing not to cooperate.\n\nThe State Department has directed some current and former diplomats not to testify, but most of them have shown up for their depositions anyway. Democrats say it\u2019s further proof that the White House impeachment blockade is crumbling.\n\nPompeo has largely brushed off questions about his involvement in the efforts of Giuliani, who claims he was acting at the behest of State Department diplomats. Sondland said this week that his understanding was that \u201call my actions involving Ukraine had the blessing of Secretary Pompeo,\u201d who had even sent him \u201ca congratulatory note that I was doing great work, and he encouraged me to keep banging away.\u201d\n\nAsked about current and former State Department employees who were choosing to testify in the probe, Pompeo seemed to encourage it \u2014 with a caveat.\n\n\u201cI hope they go to tell the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd say things that are accurate to the best of their knowledge and complete \u2014 not only accurate, but complete and then I have every expectation that Congress will perform its oversight function properly if the process is appropriate \u2026 The American people ultimately hold their elected officials accountable. I believe deeply in the process. But you have to have a process that\u2019s fair and reasonable.\u201d\n\nAndrew Desiderio and Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5d/23/1370e98f4125aa3392e148b615dc/191018-mike-pompeo-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
