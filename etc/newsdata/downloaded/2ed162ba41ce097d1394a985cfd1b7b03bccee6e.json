Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC, centers around former employee Aimee Stephens, who originally agreed to the sex-specific dress code of the establishment but later decided he wanted to present himself as a woman. Stephens was fired, and the ACLU accused Rost of discrimination.\n\nBusiness owner Thomas Rost said that is not the case and spoke after the Supreme Court heard the case.\n\n\u201cAmericans and American businesses should be able to rely on what the law says,\u201d Rost said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the Supreme Court will uphold that basic right for everyone.\n\n\u201cOur business exists to serve grieving families. There is no time in life more difficult than after losing a loved one,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cOur company has a professional code of conduct and sex-specific dress code to ensure families can focus on processing their grief,\u201d he explained.\n\nRost said he hired a male funeral director who agreed to the code of conduct and sex-specific dress code in 2007. Nearly six years later, the employee penned a letter, indicating that he wanted to violate the dress code and present himself as a female.\n\n\u201cI felt deep concern for the employee. I care about all the people who work for me. They\u2019re part of my family. That\u2019s why I intervened to save the employee\u2019s job a few months earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated that his business created the dress code for grieving families and determined that it was in the best interest of those families to reject the employee\u2019s request, describing it as a \u201cdifficult choice.\u201d\n\nEven though Rost acted in accord with federal law, the ACLU targeted his business.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU is trying to use my grandfather\u2019s business as a pawn to achieve a larger political goal that it has been unable to achieve in Congress, where this issue belongs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that the Supreme Court won\u2019t impose such unjust punishment on us,\u201d he continued. \u201cAll of us should be able to rely on what the law says.\u201d", "description": "The funeral home owner at the center of an LGBT-centered Supreme Court case says the ACLU is trying to use his business as a \"pawn.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Thomas-Rost-Speaks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
