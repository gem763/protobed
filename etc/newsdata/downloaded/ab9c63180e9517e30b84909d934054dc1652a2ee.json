Some jerks don\u2019t re-rack their weights, others don\u2019t wipe down equipment, and the worst kind of jerk takes up the only squat rack in your gym to curl for an hour.\n\nResponding to a recent post of ours, one commenter also pointed out what he considers to be another type of gym jerk: The lifter sitting on a piece of equipment and \u201cfutzing around\u201d on their phone. While it\u2019s easy to assume they\u2019re a jerk, a simple explanation is that they\u2019re resting and trying to kill a little time. (Hopefully, they\u2019ve allowed you to work in; if not, then yes, they\u2019re a total jerk.)\n\nBut what exactly do you do to pass time between sets? Well, there\u2019s no single, right answer and it depends on how long your break is. If it\u2019s a short rest, refilling your water bottle or jotting down your lift in a journal might suffice. Or you could just stare into space, but chances are that if you\u2019ve come here, you want your rest to feel a little more productive or entertaining.\n\nHow To Get Someone To Stop Hogging Gym Equipment Gym etiquette is a delicate art, and not many people get it right. 'Hogging equipment' and 'taking a rest break' can seem very similar, so it's important to know what's what, and how to deal with it. Today we\u2019ll tackle a tough question about what to do when somebody is using the equipment you want, and seemingly wasting their (and your) time.

On r/Fitness, weekly \u201cMoronic Monday\u201d, \u201cRant Wednesday\u201d and \u201cGym Story Saturday\u201d threads are full of Redditors\u2019 complaints and questions about lifting programs and general gym etiquette. (There\u2019s also the daily Simple Questions thread at the top of the subreddit each day.)\n\nEven if you don\u2019t find any applicable or valuable advice, at the very least, you\u2019ll find amusing stories that won\u2019t feel like a distraction as you focus on your next set.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned or otherwise curious about your form, it might kill time to record your lifts and use your rest period to watch the video (and try and correct your form for the next set, if needed). Our health editor, Beth, usually spends time editing videos of her lifts during her rests.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to see 30 seconds of setup, not my coach or friends and it\u2019s annoying if every thumbnail is just an empty bar and/or my thumb,\u201d she said. That, combined with writing down your lifts in a journal or phone, will likely help pass the time.\n\nAs some users suggest on a Reddit thread, you might also use the time to stretch, find the right playlist or even pick up a new hobby or skill, such as learning a new language via an app. Or you might circuit train to minimise the amount of rest between sets altogether.\n\n(On another note, both Beth and I seem to agree that answering work emails or doing anything work-related is generally a bad idea.)\n\nAnd if you are going to be on your phone, just don\u2019t let it distract you to the point that you end up hanging around the squat rack for 10 minutes just to look at memes. Stay focused, and if someone asks, let them work in.", "description": "Spend an hour at the gym and you\u2019ll likely come across at least one type of gym jerk during your workout.
