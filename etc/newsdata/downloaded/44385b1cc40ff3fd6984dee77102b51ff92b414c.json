And it has a bit of a reputation: many people claim that it causes allergies - bringing them out in a rash if they eat too much Chinese food! However, most scientists today agree that the idea that MSG causes headaches of allergies in humans is unfounded. The Japanese are the world\u2019s largest consumer of MSG per capita but they have the second longest lifespan and the lowest obesity rates in the entire world.\n\nGlutamate occurs naturally in many foods like parmesan, seaweed, peas and walnuts. And it\u2019s what gives us umami \u2013 our fifth taste. These days, MSG is made from sugar cane or molasses.\n\nPreservatives\n\nPreservatives are added to food to stop spoilage caused by bacteria. They keep foods fresher and safe to consumer for longer. As far back as Ancient Rome salt was being used to preserve food. Modern preservatives include sulphites in wine, sorbic acid in cheese or nitrates in meat products.\n\nYou may have heard the scare stories around nitrates used in bacon and ham, which are reported to contribute to cancer. It\u2019s true that when you look at these chemicals in large amounts you can get some carcinogenic effect in animals, but most experiments are using thousands of times the dose that we would naturally consume. Again, it\u2019s all about balance and moderate consumption of processed foods.\n\nAntioxidants\n\nWhile preservatives protect against microorganisms, antioxidants help to stop the spoiling effect that oxygen has on our foods. Fats and oils and the foods containing them (like crisps, for example) are most likely to suffer from oxidation and go rancid. The fats react with oxygen and begin to decompose, developing unpleasant flavours and odours! The most commonly used antioxidant in food is naturally occurring Ascorbic acid (E300) or Vitamin C. Think about how adding lemon juice to a chopped apple or lime to your guacamole will stop it going brown.", "description": "A quick guide to the bewildering world of food additives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p05d0w3j.jpg"}
