Warming myself internally while wearing a thick, fuzzy sweater makes me sweaty \u2014 and panicky \u2014 which is why I keep my cocktails cold and guzzle-able, no matter the weather.\n\nEditor's Note: You can purchase Cardamaro from a variety of online sellers, including here.\n\nFor a flawless spring spritz, you\u2019ll need a bit of Cardamaro. In spite of what its name might imply, the vermouth-like liqueur is not cardamum-flavoured. It\u2019s made with cardoon and blessed thistle, two artichoke relatives that give the mascato-based aperitif an earthy, foresty flavour. If you\u2019ve ever tried Cynar and thought \u201cI almost like this,\u201d you will most likely love Cardamaro and its slightly syrupy dried fruit sensibility. Mix it with an apple-y white wine and high-quality ginger beer, and you have a most autumnal spritz. To make it, you will need:\n\n60mL chilled white wine (look for one that has \u201cgreen apple\u201d in the tasting notes)\n\n30mL Cardamaro\n\n60mL chilled ginger beer\n\nAdd the first two ingredients to a lowball with a big ice cube (or a handful of small cubes) and give it a little stir. Add the ginger beer, slightly stir once more, and garnish with an apple slice if you\u2019re feeling twee. Guzzle and repeat as needed.", "description": "A lot of people like to drink hot alcohol in cold weather, but I am not one of those people.
