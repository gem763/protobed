In 2018, the Bruins were clearly the better team, but the Leafs led the most recent matchup 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 before losing on home ice with a chance to clinch in Game 6. Boston then won Game 7 at TD Garden.\n\n\"We need to take a step forward,\" Matthews said. \"The Achilles heel has always been that first round for us, so just trying to get over that hump. It's tough to measure a successful season without reaching that ultimate goal and accomplishing it.\n\n\"It's been frustrating the last two years \u2014 same team, same result. For us, [it's] just making sure that everybody's just really focused and dialed in.\"\n\nDubas said at the start of training camp he wants to see his team get better at dealing with adversity after three consecutive first-round playoff exits. (Christopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press)\n\nHead coach: Mike Babcock enters the fifth season of an eight-year contract.\n\nLast season: 46-28-8, lost in first round of the playoffs to the Boston Bruins for the second straight year.\n\nKey players: Auston Matthews \u2014 The star centre was flying high after signing a five-year, US$58-million contract extension that kicked in July 1 before the disorderly conduct and disruptive behaviour charge came to light. Matthews has missed 34 games with various injuries over the last two seasons. If he can stay healthy, Matthews could get to 50 goals for the first time in his career.\n\nJohn Tavares \u2014 Toronto's quiet leader found instant chemistry with Mitch Marner last season after inking with the Leafs in unrestricted free agency. The 29-year-old centre registered career-highs with 47 goals and 88 points, but his calm demeanour is also important on a young team still trying to break through.\n\nFrederik Andersen \u2014 Set to turn 30 on Wednesday, the Leafs' goalie has started at least 60 games in each of his three seasons with Toronto. Andersen allowed just one goal in exhibition play after struggling with a nagging groin injury for stretches of last season. There's no doubt the Leafs can fill the net, but with a defence corps sporting some new faces, Andersen's health will be key.\n\nThe big question: Can the Leafs take that next step? Toronto certainly has the talent up front, but how a new-look blue line meshes could go a long way in determining the Leafs' fate. Tyson Barrie came over as the centrepiece of the Nazem Kadri trade with the Colorado Avalanche and, along with Morgan Rielly and rookie Rasmus Sandin, should help get the puck up to the likes of Matthews, Tavares, Marner and William Nylander even quicker.", "description": "After consecutive playoff disappointments, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas said at the start of training camp he wants to see his team get better at dealing with adversity.
