The deficiencies have prompted the coroners to call for an investigation by Quebec's nursing oversight body. In a previous investigation, we took hidden cameras into an Ontario nursing home to see how staffing shortages could affect patient care.\n\nToyota customers fuming over missing parts\n\nToyota owners coast to coast have been left in the dark about when parts needed to repair their vehicles will arrive. The company says the issue has been caused by a \"planned systems transformation to provide an improved overall customer experience.\"\n\nCatrina Brown of Halifax said she has waited two months for her Toyota to be repaired because the collision centre can't get parts from the company. She is shown here with a rental car. (Robert Short/CBC)\n\nRed Bull settlement payout\n\nYou could be entitled to up to $10 in compensation thanks to a class-action lawsuit against Red Bull. The company allegedly \"failed to inform consumers of the inherent dangers concerning the ingestion of its caffeinated energy drinks,\" according to a consumer rights law firm. Canadians have until mid October to make a claim.\n\nCanadians who consumed or bought a Red Bull energy drink between Jan. 1, 2007 and July 23, 2019, could be entitled to up to $10 in compensation. (Simon Dawson/Reuters)\n\nWarning about FlightHub, JustFly\n\nFollowing a CBC News story about complaints against online travel agency FlightHub, the Better Business Bureau now says FlightHub and sister company JustFly generated nearly 800 customer complaints over the past 12 months. The business watchdog says many of the complaints are similar.\n\nAdrian Dywan of Niagara Falls, Ont., got his money back plus gift certificates from FlightHub after CBC News contacted the online travel agency about the invalid ticket he purchased on the site.
