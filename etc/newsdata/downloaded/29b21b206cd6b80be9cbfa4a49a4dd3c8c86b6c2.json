Designed by Peter Salter Taran Wilkhu\n\nNorth Greenwich to Blackheath\n\nLength: 3.5 miles\n\nFor a pick and mix sort of walk, amble from North Greenwich to Blackheath, taking in some of south-east London\u2019s most eclectic sights. Starting at North Greenwich Pier \u2013 home to the O2 arena and Antony Gormley\u2019s Hellraiser-style Quantum Cloud sculpture \u2013 it follows the river past the fancy Greenwich Yacht Club and then on to the Thames Barrier. You\u2019ll pass through Hanging Wood, where marauding 18th-century highwaymen carried out their dastardly deeds, then trudge across the urban oasis of Woolwich Common. Next, stroll past the 17th century alms house of Morden College, and end at the village pond at the corner of Blackheath, where Canada geese scoot past and tiny children dole out breadcrumbs to ducks.\n\nHampstead Heath circular walk\n\nLength: 4 miles\n\nOne of the country\u2019s most famous heaths has featured in plays, on screen and in fiction, and is definitely best explored on two feet. Begin your four-mile ramble on Hampstead High Street and stroll past the historic, red-brick Campden Baths and Wash Houses, built in the late 19th century to help the workers of North London stay squeaky clean. The next stop, the museum and arts centre of Burgh House, is even older (dating back to 1703), but the real draw here is the Heath itself, where you can pootle about the grassy expanses, discovering the famous bathing ponds, Parliament Hill \u2013 with its iconic panorama across central London \u2013 and Kenwood House, with an art collection that includes works by Turner, Rembrandt and Barbara Hepworth\u2019s Monolith-Empyrean on the lawn.\n\nRichmond to Ham House\n\nLength: 4.5 miles\n\nThe view from the top of Richmond Hill down towards the Thames \u2013 where rowers glide past and swans gather their cygnets \u2013 is the only view in the country protected by an act of Parliament. Wander towards Richmond Park for a stroll amongst the deer, then head to the village of Ham where Georgian Mansions line the pretty streets. Nearby, you\u2019ll find the atmospheric 17th century Ham House. Once owned by William Murray and his tenacious daughter Elizabeth, it\u2019s now a National Trust property, with beautiful landscaped gardens, ghost tours around its shadowy halls and a caf\u00e9 serving up superlative cream teas.\n\nThe Parkland Walk\n\nLength: 2.5 miles\n\nParkland is officially London\u2019s longest nature reserve (it stretches for two and a half miles along a leafy disused railway line) making it a prime place to spot bumbling hedgehogs, wily foxes and cute muntjac deer. The line used to connect Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace, and there are still vestiges of the old railway dotted around the place, from abandoned platforms to echoing old tunnels. It\u2019s a fairly easy stroll and you\u2019ll likely be sharing the route with dog walkers, cyclists and runners, but you\u2019ll feel far, far away from the heady bustle of London.\n\nTate Modern to Jubilee Gardens, Southbank\n\nLength: 1 mile\n\nThe South Bank is a cinematic sort of spot, especially when the sun goes down and the swell of commuters subsides to a trickle of evening amblers. Walk the mile or so from the famous Tate Modern to the Jubilee Gardens at the foot of the staggering, red-lit London Eye, and you\u2019ll pass the glow of Victorian lamp posts reflected on the inky waters of the Thames, the National Theatre decked out in its after-dark stream of colours and Westminster lit from below like a stage star.\n\nIn association with Voltarol.
