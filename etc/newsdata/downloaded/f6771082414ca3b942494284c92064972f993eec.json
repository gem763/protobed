I\u2019m in shock and when I look at the page I want to cry.\n\n\u201dPeople are so kind and have been amazing. I want to say thank you to everyone who has helped and especially to Paige.\n\n\u201dBefore my diagnosis I was a complete worrier and couldn\u2019t cope with the littlest thing. But my whole outlook has changed and I can\u2019t believe how positive I am.\u201d\n\nFaith hopes to go for a beach holiday in Mexico or the Caribbean - the sort of place \u2018she had never dreamed in a million years\u2019 she would be able to visit.\n\nShe was originally diagnosed in June 2018 and after having a 17cm tumour removed from her abdomen was initially cancer free.\n\nBut the cancer returned in February and had spread to her liver, kidney and pelvis.\n\nOf those with Faith\u2019s diagnosis just under 50 per cent live a year, a similar proportion live for two and a small percentage live for five.\n\nPaige has also been left gobsmacked by the kind response to the fundraiser.\n\nShe said: \u201cFaith is a wonderful person who lights up a room so when I heard about this it was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201dI have been blown away by the response and couldn\u2019t be more grateful. It restores your faith in humanity.\"\n\nTo donate visit her GoFundMe page here .\n\nOther friends of Faith - Ella Blinkhorn, Michael Mason and Sam Maguire - have also set up fundraisers.\n\nAnyone who donates will be entered into a prize raffle.", "description": "Faith Mitchell, 32, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, is suffering from stage four leiomyosarcoma but cannot pay the \u00a33,000 demanded by insurance companies for her holiday", "authors": ["Alex Scapens", "Neil Murphy", "Image", "Cheshire-Live.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650118.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_181019SLUG_6833JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
