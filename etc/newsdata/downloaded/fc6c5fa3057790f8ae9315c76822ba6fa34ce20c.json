(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nThere\u2019s one element that\u2019s been missing from the timeline surrounding a still-secret whistleblower complaint apparently involving a conversation President Trump had with a foreign leader.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Thursday that the complaint involves Ukraine. That revelation immediately generated speculation that the behavior at issue surrounded a public effort by Trump allies to undermine former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination or, should he be nominated, his general election campaign.\n\nThat effort, led by Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, theorizes that Biden acted inappropriately in 2016 when he called for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor at the risk of Ukraine losing substantial foreign aid. The prosecutor may have been investigating a company that had Biden\u2019s son Hunter as a board member, but the prosecutor was also a target of widespread criticism for failing to adequately crack down on public corruption. The Bidens have repeatedly insisted that the then-vice president\u2019s demand of Ukraine wasn\u2019t linked to Hunter Biden\u2019s work.\n\nOver the course of this week, there has been an effort to construct a timeline that could help identify the nature of the whistleblower complaint. We know, for example, that Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke at the end of July. According to Zelensky\u2019s office, that call included Trump\u2019s expressing confidence that \u201cthe new Ukrainian government\u201d \u2014 Zelensky was sworn in in late May \u2014 \u201cwill be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorruption\u201d is precisely how Giuliani referred to his Biden investigation on CNN on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cHe had every right to say to the Ukrainian president, \u2018We have two outstanding allegations of massive corruption, and you should investigate it,\u2019 \u201d Giuliani said when asked by host Chris Cuomo whether Trump had mentioned Biden to Zelensky.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that during Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, Trump had been more specific than Giuliani suggests, pressuring the Ukrainian president to target Hunter Biden specifically. The Post has confirmed that report.\n\nGiuliani has been focused on this alleged Ukrainian issue for months. In early May, shortly before Zelensky was inaugurated, Giuliani was reportedly planning to travel to Ukraine to ask Zelensky to dig into the issues. That trip was canceled after criticism that Giuliani was essentially doing overtly what Trump had privately been accused of in regard to Russia: soliciting political information from a foreign power. Giuliani\u2019s trip came to light only weeks after the public release of the report of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III detailing Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and points to overlap with Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s worth highlighting one side story to Mueller\u2019s probe. In May of last year, the New York Times reported that Ukrainian officials had stopped providing assistance to Mueller\u2019s investigation out of concern for how it would affect the country\u2019s relationship with the United States and a pending agreement on military assistance.\n\nTrump himself mentioned the Biden allegations in a Fox News interview in May.\n\n\u201cLook at Joe Biden,\u201d he said. \u201cHe calls them and says, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare persecute, if you don\u2019t fire this prosecutor\u2019 \u2014 The prosecutor was after his son. Then he said, \u2018If you fire the prosecutor, you\u2019ll be okay. And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u2019 or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?\u201d\n\nAs The Post has reported, this is an inaccurate representation of what Biden did.\n\nBut the timing is important. That was May 19, the day before Zelensky\u2019s inauguration and about a week after Giuliani canceled his trip.\n\nA few weeks later, Trump was asked by ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos whether he would accept assistance from a foreign power for his 2020 campaign or whether he would turn the material over to the FBI. Trump speculated that he might \u201cdo both.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you might want to listen, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with listening,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cIf somebody called from a country, Norway, \u2018we have information on your opponent\u2019? Oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d\n\nThat comment prompted a public rebuke from the chair of the Federal Election Commission, who said that what Trump suggested was illegal, and \u201cnot a novel concept.\u201d Trump later revised his comment to say that while \u201cof course, you have to look at it,\u201d he would then \u201cgive it to the FBI or report it to the attorney general or somebody like that.\u201d\n\nThe conversation with Zelensky was July 25, well after Trump expressed concern about Biden\u2019s actions and after he acknowledged that he was receptive to looking at material provided by foreign countries. A few days after the call, Trump announced the resignation of then-director of national intelligence Daniel Coats. (He and Coats had been at odds since at least early July.) On Aug. 12, the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was filed. At some point around this time, Giuliani met with a representative of Zelensky\u2019s in Madrid.\n\nIn late August, Politico reported that the Trump administration was delaying military aid meant to go to Ukraine \u201cin order to ensure the money is being used in the best interest of the United States.\u201d Two weeks later, the aid was reinstated. That reinstatement came one day before Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, subpoenaed the acting director of national intelligence to obtain a copy of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nUnusually, The Post\u2019s editorial board wrote Sept. 5 that it had been \u201creliably told\u201d that the withholding of aid was meant \u201cto force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts here, and it\u2019s not confirmed that the whistleblower complaint specifically deals with Trump having discussed the Biden allegations with Ukraine\u2019s president. But the following order of events is correct:\n\nGiuliani\u2019s intent to go to Ukraine to talk to Zelensky about Biden is reported. Trump talks to Fox News about those allegations, indicating his familiarity with them. Trump indicates an openness to accepting aid from a foreign country to help his election. Trump talks to Zelensky, pressuring him to investigate Hunter Biden. The Trump administration delays military aid to Ukraine. It then reverses that decision immediately before the complaint comes to public attention.\n\nThere are gaps of various lengths between those events, and there isn\u2019t yet a demonstrated, public throughline between them. If such a throughline emerges, however, the ramifications are significant.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint may be that throughline.", "description": "This summer, Trump was asked about aid from Russia.
