Against the previous quarter, however, NII was down 2.7%.\n\nUnicaja meanwhile reported a more than 3% fall in NII in the quarter against the year-ago period and was down 2.5% against the previous quarter.\n\nShares in Bankia were down 3.3% at 0926 GMT, while Unicaja stock was up 0.8%.\n\nAMBITIOUS AIM\n\n\u201c(Bankia) NII was in line with UBSe/consensus, but declined circa 3% quarter-on=quarter and makes management\u2019s aim to repeat last year\u2019s 2.05 billion euro annual number increasingly ambitious, with a c5% quarter-on=quarter pick up needed in the fourth quarter,\u201d UBS said in a note.\n\nIn an attempt to offset the impact of increasing competition on margins, Spanish banks are focusing on cutting costs.\n\nBankia is shifting its focus from a mostly mortgage loan book to a more profitable consumer and enterprise business.\n\nOn Monday, Bankia said it was advancing in setting up a joint venture unit called \u2018Soyou\u2019 with Credit Agricole in consumer lending.\n\nIn the first nine months, Bankia expanded its net loan book by 0.4%.\n\nAt the end of September, Bankia\u2019s core Tier-1 capital ratio, the strictest measure of solvency, was 13% compared to 12.91% at the end of June.\n\nBankia has so far generated 1.28 billion euros in excess capital since it launched its plan in February last year to return 2.5 billion euros ($3.1 billion) to shareholders over three years in an effort to pay back part of public bailout cash.[L8N27C0DD]\n\nBankia got a 22.4 billion-euro rescue package in 2012 to recover from property-loan losses at the height of Spain\u2019s financial crisis. The government is now selling off the 61% stake it holds.", "description": "Spain's state-owned Bankia and smaller savings bank Unicaja reported on Monday a fall in lending income in the third quarter, hurt by ultra-low interest rates.", "authors": ["Jes\u00fas Aguado", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
