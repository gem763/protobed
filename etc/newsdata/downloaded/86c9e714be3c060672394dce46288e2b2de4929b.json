Human faeces shouldn't be on any street,' she said.\n\n'Something needs to be done.'\n\nThe 39-year-old celebrity publicist is determined to find the culprit and posted the videos to Instagram to get public assistance on Monday evening.\n\nJacenko deleted footage of the incident from her Instagram account - which has nearly 250,000 followers - on Tuesday morning.\n\nShe told Daily Mail Australia she 'actually didn't want to look at it any longer, it's simply revolting.\n\n'I don\u2019t believe that this is a medical condition, and if it is, there are many ways to ensure that this is managed using incontinence products which are readily available rather than a street by residences, places of work and even worse a junior school.\n\nShe claimed: 'This person is looking for a thrill which is why this is happening in full daylight, multiple times a week in the SAME spot. We aren't talking about a one off, this is a repeat offender.'\n\nVideos show the jogger desperately running and crouching behind a car to relieve herself (pictured)\n\nThe PR maven shared videos of a woman running behind a car on Watson Street in Paddington, pulling down her pants and relieving herself on two occasions (pictured)\n\nDefecating in public is a type of offensive conduct in New South Wales and carries a maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment and/or a $660 fine. NSW Police say officers are investigating.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Ms Jacenko told Kyle and Jackie-O that the woman deserves no sympathy.\n\n'This isn't a person with irritable bowel syndrome, this is a person who's getting off on it!' Roxy said on Tuesday, after some of her Instagram followers suggested the woman may have a health problem.\n\nShe added: 'When I Googled it [public defecation], I was shocked how around the world this is a thing.'\n\nRoxy then encouraged the unidentified woman and other poo joggers to find a better hobby, saying: 'Take up swimming, or something? Why do you need to s**t in the street?'\n\nWhile it has been understood the woman took to the streets as she couldn't hold it in, the owner of a nearby cafe said she ran straight past the business and could have used the toilet.\n\nIn another video taken on Monday morning, the jogger is seen once again crouching behind a car and relieving herself\n\nWhile the third video does not show the woman defecating, it is a clear shot of her running down the street, wearing navy running tights and a lavender top\n\n'From the footage I think we may have recognised the woman but it's not someone we know,' owner of Wolf cafe, Sam Gregg, told news.com.au.\n\nMr Gregg said the behaviour was not particularly out-of-the-ordinary, as Ms Jacenko's office has been targeted multiple times.\n\nHowever, he did say this was the first time someone took to the street to do their business repeatedly about 6am.\n\n'It's 50-50 that it's someone targeting her. It's an odd thing to do,' Mr Gregg said.\n\n'If you were in real desperate need to go to the toilet we were open, so she could have come and used the toilet. So that would again point to (it being targeted).'\n\nIt is the latest in a string of public defecation incidents in Australia, including a business executive who was famously caught relieving himself repeatedly while on morning jogs.\n\nPsychologist Dr Grant Brecht said possible motivations for poo jogging behaviour include vindictiveness, the 'thrill' of it, mental illness - and, obviously, stomach issues.\n\nClinical psychologist Dr Grant Brecht says there are several possible reasons for the phenomenon\n\n'One reason is they may actually need to go to the loo - they've got a bout of diarrhea or something. Let's not exclude that,' Dr Brecht said.\n\n'If we're talking about recidivists, who do it quite regularly ... it can also be a 'get back' (at someone).\n\n'Something has happened and \"cop this\". It's kind of, \"I'm going to poo all over you''.'\n\nDr Brecht said a more 'alarming' explanation is the result of an obsessive-compulsive or anxiety disorder.\n\nIS THERE BE A PHYSICAL REASON FOR 'POO JOGGING?' When a similar incident occurred last year, Royal Melbourne Hospital's gastroenterology professor, Dr Geoff Hebbard, said physical activity can get the gut moving. 'Vigorous exercise can have significant effect on the gut although that would usually be more than a jog around the block,' Dr Hebbard explained.\n\n'(That is) where a person believes if they don't do this, if they don't continue to do it, something bad is going to happen to them or a family member.\n\n'Or they'll bring bad luck on themselves or others and then get these compulsive thoughts and obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours around needing to do this in the same spot everyday.\n\n'It's a similar sport of thing to people not wanting to step on cracks, a superstitious thing.'\n\nA third explanation is Ms Jacenko's theory - that the 'poo joggers' enjoy the sheer thrill, or relief, from the brazen act.\n\n'They take a risk and they get a buzz,' said Dr Brecht.\n\n'It can have that element, as does any sort of addictive behaviour associated with an emotional and physiological high.\n\n'They get an adrenalin rush - it's like having an gambling addiction or a sex addiction.'\n\nPsychologist Dr Brecht said that, rather than public shaming, the best way to deal with a poo jogger was to contact authorities, or 'try and front the person if you feel OK about it'.\n\n'We've just got to be careful of kneejerk reactions ... sometimes we need to take a deep breath and work it out,' he said.", "description": "Roxy Jacenko shut down rumours the Paddington poo jogger she caught defecating outside her Sydney office may be Jackie O, before jokingly comparing Carrie Bickmore to the culprit.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri", "Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19731956-0-image-a-25_1571130866929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
