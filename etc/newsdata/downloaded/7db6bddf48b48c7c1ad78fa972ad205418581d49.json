So no, I don\u2019t plan on guarding it.\u201d\n\nWell, a good thief can find a way to steal anything.\n\nAnd sure enough, police in Oxfordshire were alerted to a burglary at 4:57 a.m. local time on Saturday. They arrived to the scene to discover that a band of thieves had spirited away with the golden throne, which had already been used at least 100,000 times in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened by this extraordinary event, but also relieved no-one was hurt,\u201d a spokesperson for Blenheim Palace said in a statement. \u201cWe are very grateful to our staff and to Thames Valley Police for their rapid and brave reactions.\u201d\n\nThe toilet, designed by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, is called \u201cAmerica.\u201d Critics have described it both as a reflection of American obsession with luxury and consumerism and as a depiction of the American Dream.\n\nIt was previously on display in a public bathroom on the fifth-floor of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, where museum-goers queued for hours for the chance to pop a squat \u2014 and staffers diligently cleaned it at 15-minute intervals.\n\nThe Guggenheim famously offered the toilet to President Trump in 2017, in lieu of his request for Van Gogh\u2019s 1888 \u201cLandscape With Snow.\u201d\n\nAccording to an email obtained by The Washington Post early last year, the museum\u2019s chief curator told the White House that Cattelan \u201cwould like to offer it to the White House for a long-term loan.\u201d When reached by The Post at the time, and asked to explain why he offered the toilet to the Trumps, Cattelan said: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of our life? Everything seems absurd until we die, and then it makes sense.\u201d\n\nThe toilet was never welcomed into the White House, but was installed in Blenheim Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this summer as part of an exhibition of Cattelan\u2019s controversial work. Other pieces on display include a child-size statue of Adolf Hitler on his knees, his hands folded as though in prayer, and a statue of Pope John Paul II crushed under the weight of a meteorite.\n\nThe exhibition opened just two days ago and was scheduled to run through Oct. 27. Visitors who paid around $33 for entrance to the grounds were able to sign up in advance for time slots that allowed them to use the functioning loo for a maximum of three minutes each.\n\nThe palace said a lot of visitors were looking forward to the opportunity to see Cattelan\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore a great shame an item so precious has been taken,\u201d a palace spokesperson said. On Saturday afternoon, the online booking page for the toilet appeared to have been taken down.\n\nAs one would imagine, the heist also caused a bit of a mess.\n\n\u201cDue to the toilet being plumbed in to the building, this has caused significant damage and flooding,\u201d detective inspector Jess Milne said in a statement, adding that the offenders are believed to have used at least two vehicles in their getaway.\n\nOne 66-year-old man has already been arrested, but the police declined to elaborate further on what they described as a \u201clive investigation.\u201d\n\nThe palace closed its doors Saturday but planned to reopen for what remained of the exhibition Sunday.\n\nSpencer-Churchill told the Guardian in May that \u201cdespite being born with a silver spoon in my mouth,\u201d he\u2019d never used a golden toilet. \u201cSo I look forward to it,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nThe Washington Post was unable to immediately confirm if he had the chance before it disappeared.\n\nRead more\n\nThe White House asked to borrow a van Gogh.
