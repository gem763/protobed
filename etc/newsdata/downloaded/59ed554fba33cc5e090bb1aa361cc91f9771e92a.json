Bush who tried unsuccessfully to reverse it. Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) have also called for Trump to exempt the state from the rule.\n\n\u201cIt should never have been applied to our state, and it is harming our ability to develop a sustainable, year-round economy for the Southeast region,\u201d Murkowski said in a statement to the Washington Post.\n\nThe old-growth trees of the Tongass National Forest provide a MAJOR BUFFER against climate change.https://t.co/wW5bGGhBnK \u2014 Earthjustice (@Earthjustice) August 25, 2019\n\nEnvironmentalists, however, fear the implications of opening up the rainforest to commercial activities.\n\nThe pristine forest includes thousands of islands along with glacial fjords and old-growth cedar, spruce, and hemlock trees \u2014 old-growth trees are those that have generally grown undisturbed for at least 120 years. The area supports countless wildlife, including all five species of Pacific salmon, brown bears, wolves, and Bald Eagles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the years, logging has threatened the oldest \u2014 and largest \u2014 trees. But while only 9% of the rare forest has so far been threatened by logging, according to the Audubon Society \u201cperhaps half of the big-tree old growth has been cut.\u201d\n\nThe forest is also a vital player in tackling climate change.\n\n\u201cThe Tongass stores hundreds of millions, if not over a billion, tons of carbon, keeping the heat-trapping element out of the atmosphere,\u201d wrote Earthjustice, which tweeted that the old-growth trees provide a \u201cMAJOR BUFFER\u201d against climate change.\n\nCutting down ancient trees risks not just releasing the carbon stored in them over the past century but also reducing the forest\u2019s ability to store new carbon.\n\nNews of the Trump administration\u2019s logging intentions in Tongass come as another major forest suffers devastating wildfires. In Brazil, more than 26,000 forest fires have been recorded in the Amazon this month \u2014 the most in a decade.\n\nLike the Tongass, the Amazon \u2014 often referred to as the \u201clungs\u201d of the planet \u2014 plays a vital role in storing carbon as well as critical habitat to endangered species.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-849886740.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1"}
