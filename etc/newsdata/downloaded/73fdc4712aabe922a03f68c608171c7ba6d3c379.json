Even after they picked up the show they didn\u2019t want to put it on the air,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I\u2019m a stubborn person and I was very protective of the comedy. And because I fought for it to get on the air in its purest form the show became a success and once it became a success that did open the door for other shows that came after it.\u201d\n\nOf course, Green\u2019s fall was just as rapid as his rise. After he was diagnosed with testicular cancer at just 28 years old, MTV stopped production on the show. Once he was in remission, Green made a play for movie stardom.\n\nFirst came the hits Road Trip and Charlie\u2019s Angels, where he met Barrymore. Then there was Freddy Got Fingered, which he not only starred in but also wrote and directed. While Green says people still approach him nearly every day to quote lines from the film like, \u201cDaddy, would you like some sausage,\u201d it was a massive box office flop that more or less derailed his comedy career.\n\n\u201cI had multiple films that I could have done instead of Freddy Got Fingered,\u201d Green reveals, including ones \u201cthat other people wrote, that major studios were coming to me with, that major stars ended up doing, that became huge movies.\u201d\n\nGreen imagines an alternate universe where\u2014instead of making one of the biggest bombs of all time\u2014he starred in a string of wildly successful comedy hits. On the one hand, he says that \u201cwould have been pretty cool,\u201d but on the other, he adds, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have been as satisfied creatively with what I was doing.\u201d\n\nNearly two decades later, Green is a working stand-up comedian, touring the world \u201cpretty much non-stop\u201d and trying to stay relevant through bizarre stints on reality shows like Celebrity Big Brother and before that, The Celebrity Apprentice, on which he was fired by Donald Trump for staying out too late drinking with Dennis Rodman.\n\nEarlier this year, Green finally became a U.S. citizen. \u201cIt\u2019s nice knowing that I can\u2019t get kicked out. It\u2019s nice knowing that I can vote,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think it really had anything to do with my old boss.\u201d\n\nHighlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nOn \u2018speaking truth to power\u2019 on \u2018The Tom Green Show\u2019\n\n\u201cI still think there was an element of The Tom Green Show where we were speaking truth to power. As a 28 year old, I sort of felt like I was rebelling against authority and the status quo and the media and even the way comedy was made. Take something like hanging a painting on the wall of the National Art Gallery of Canada and seeing how long it would stay there. When you\u2019re getting chased by a security guard, the \u2018power\u2019 for a 28-year-old skateboarder is the security guard. I felt like in some ways we were mocking television and even mocking comedy. And I think that may have potentially rubbed some people the wrong way, even in the comedy industry.\u201d\n\nDoes he regret any of his \u2018Tom Green Show\u2019 pranks?\n\n\u201cMost of the bits, before we shot it, we would say what\u2019s the requirement to go shoot this? And my friends and I would look at each other and say, well let\u2019s think of something where in 20 years if someone asks you if you regret it you\u2019ll say, yes I regret it\u2014OK, let\u2019s do that. Let\u2019s think of something that will make us cringe. Let\u2019s try to do something that\u2019s the most embarrassing, ridiculous, crazy, strange thing possible. Because we went into with that mindset, there\u2019s not really anything [that I regret]. I always felt like I had a moral and ethical line that I didn\u2019t cross. I never wanted anybody to be ridiculed in a way that, if you take a step back and get out of the heat of the moment\u2014I think anybody that appeared on camera, once they stepped back and realized what was going on, they weren\u2019t really offended by it.\u201d\n\nHow his cancer diagnosis altered the course of his career\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it ended. There are some misconceptions out there, because the show wasn\u2019t canceled. I quit the show. Essentially I did the cancer special and that was the last episode of The Tom Green Show. People sometimes think it was canceled when they talk about it. I\u2019ve tried to clarify that over the years, because it does matter to me that people know that the show wasn\u2019t canceled. It\u2019s kind of rare that a show goes out on top like that. So I had cancer, I had this massive surgery, removing lymph nodes out of the back of my spine and all this stuff and it was extremely painful. To be completely honest with you, I had major opportunities in film. I was being offered Stealing Harvard, Freddy Got Fingered, other movies that I didn\u2019t do, Road Trip. There were huge opportunities for me, coupled with the fact that I could not see myself in that condition going out on the street and falling down on the ground and getting chased by people.\u201d\n\nWhy he \u2018actually liked\u2019 Donald Trump on \u2018The Celebrity Apprentice\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is surreal to say that you know the president of the United States. I can recall dozens of one-on-one conversations I had with him while we were filming. I do find it disappointing\u2014and that\u2019s the kindest way I can put it\u2014the rhetoric that he has used, the racial division that he has used. That I find so upsetting. Because if it wasn\u2019t for that\u2014the divisive, racial tone that he has brought to the country\u2014if it wasn\u2019t for that, I would actually like him. It\u2019s not like I have a problem with the way he\u2019s aggressive on trade or the way he is with so many issues. That to me is upsetting, because I actually liked Donald Trump. The reason I did The Celebrity Apprentice is because I thought he was funny. Even when he screamed at me and fired me I liked him.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Stand-up comedian and star of ABC\u2019s Black-ish and Grown-ish, Deon Cole", "description": "The man who changed MTV with his infamous prank show opens up about his rise to fame and current life as a stand-up comic and reality show star.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569910933/190930-Wilstein-Last-Laugh-Tom-Green-tease_blcmy3", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
