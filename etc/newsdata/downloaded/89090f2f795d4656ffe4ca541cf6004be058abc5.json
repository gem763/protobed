After a scandal within the populist radical right Freedom party (FP\u00d6), the FP\u00d6\u2019s coalition government with the conservative People\u2019s party collapsed. New elections were held, which led to a mass exodus of Freedom party voters to the People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP).\n\nWhen the Freedom party first entered the government in 2000, other EU member states confronted Austria with a boycott. That feels like a long time ago; when the Freedom party returned in 2017, radical right parties were in government in Hungary and Poland, and radical right policies were no longer at the fringes of European politics.\n\nSimilarly, in Austria, politics have moved on. In 2016, the Freedom party candidate Norbert Hofer, now the party leader, almost won the presidency, drawing significant support from People\u2019s party supporters in the second round of the elections. And the People\u2019s party is no longer the mainstream conservative party of Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, who had to fight off significant internal opposition to his coalition with the Freedom party. Today\u2019s \u201cnew people\u2019s party\u201d is the personal vehicle of Sebastian Kurz.\n\nAt just 33 years old, Kurz, the almighty leader of the conservative People\u2019s party, has achieved what almost all politicians aspire to: he is central to Austrian politics. With a monster score of roughly 37% of the vote, an increase of almost 6%, Kurz is certain to return as prime minister. The only remaining question is: with whom?\n\nKurz has the Qual der Wahl (agony of choice), given that an unprecedented number of coalition options are possible. Strengthened by an extremely strong (personal) mandate, he can play the social democratic party against the populist radical right Freedom party, which both suffered painful losses. And this still leaves him fallback options of a coalition with the Greens, the biggest winners, and even a minority government.\n\nMany pundits are already writing off a new \u00d6VP-FP\u00d6 coalition, pointing to opposition within both the conservative and the populist radical right party. But at this point, this seems the most likely coalition. First, Kurz is ideologically closest to the FP\u00d6 and can now govern with them on his own terms. Second, the vast majority of both \u00d6VP and particularly FP\u00d6 voters were \u201cvery or rather\u201d satisfied with the previous Kurz government. This will make it very hard for FP\u00d6 leaders to reject a decent offer by Kurz.\n\nAnd Kurz can easily ignore any remaining internal dissenters. The Austrian political Wunderkind (miracle child) has personally revived the faltering party, bringing them back from a low of 24% in 2013 to 37% six years later. In 2017 more than half of \u00d6VP voters (54%) named Kurz as one of the main reason for their vote. And despite the fall of his coalition government, Kurz was still the most important reason for the electoral victory this Sunday \u2013 almost one third of \u00d6VP voters named him.\n\nThis is not to say that there won\u2019t be some cosmetic changes. Some FP\u00d6 hardliners will be sacrificed, notably former FP\u00d6 leader and Deputy Chancellor \u201cHC\u201d Strache (who was at the heart of the Ibizagate scandal) and former Minister of Interior Herbert Kickl, involved in a range of corruption and political scandals. New FP\u00d6 leader Hofer will probably stay in parliament, so as not to become politically compromised by an \u00d6VP-dominated government, and use the time to rebuild the party after yet another scandalous period.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the coalition negotiations, Kurz will brand his new government, and himself, as more centrist, rather than as the bridge between the mainstream right and radical right, as he did in 2017. There will be fewer photo-ops with Hungarian strongman Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and more visits to Berlin and Brussels, as he reassesses the \u201cEuropean mood\u201d.\n\nBut this does not mean that Kurz has actually moderated. Even in this campaign, as arrivals of asylum seekers to Europe have plummeted and immigration no longer dominates the concerns of Europeans, Kurz stated: \u201cPeople often come up to me at events and say they don\u2019t feel at home in their own neighborhood. They almost feel foreign where they live \u2026 We must keep fighting illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nKurz may change the tactical course of his party and government, and rebrand them as \u201ccentrist\u201d, but it mainly illustrates how rightwing the Austrian and European center have become. In this way, Kurz remains the perfect bellwether for European politics.", "description": "Sebastian Kurz may change the drift of his party and government, and rebrand them as \u2018centrist\u2019, but it mainly illustrates how rightwing the Austrian and European center have become", "authors": ["Cas Mudde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c2ee6fd0ee717d3b85f4ffcef98b654086d3ac3/0_140_4858_2916/master/4858.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=030852285dcce00f9b9d498f96c6398c"}
