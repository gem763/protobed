Over 700 species come into contact with marine litter which is found from the poles to the equator, and estimates are that the quantity of plastic in the oceans will triple in the decade to 2025,' said Professor Richard Thompson, OBE, Director of the Marine Institute, University of Plymouth, in a statement.\n\n'The Mayflower Autonomous Ship gives us the opportunity to rethink how to collect data and further our understanding of this global issue.'\n\nIBM and Promare will be one of many organizations currently attempting to pioneer a future generation of sea-faring autonomous vessels capable of traversing waters without a human pilot.\n\nOther company's involved in the effort to build autonomous ships include automaker, Rolls-Royce and the tech giant Intel who have partnered to build self-navigating cargo ships.", "description": "Once completed, the self-navigating craft is slated to make a 3,000-mile journey across the Atlantic on September 2020 - a date that coincides with a 400-year anniversary for the original Mayflower voyage.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19797372-0-image-a-26_1571244815544.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
