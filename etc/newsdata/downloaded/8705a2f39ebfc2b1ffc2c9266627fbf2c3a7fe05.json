If there\u2019s a no-deal Brexit, it\u2019s not going to be OK. But people are doing all they can to ensure Britain keeps trading.\u201d\n\nThe transport minister, George Freeman, confirmed the government\u2019s \u201cplanning assumption\u201d was that no-deal disruption would roughly halve the traffic \u2013 a fall of 40%-60% \u2013 able to pass through Britain\u2019s main trading link for three months.\n\nYellowhammer: no-deal chaos fears as secret Brexit papers published Read more\n\nDover handles \u00a3122bn a year by value, or 17% of the UK\u2019s trade in goods. A fleet of 12 ferries carries more lorries than all other UK ports combined, on the shortest sea crossing between the UK and the EU.\n\nFreeman said he hoped goodwill would prevail if a deal was not agreed by 31 October, averting worst case disruption. Asked what preparations the government was making for \u201cmalign interventions\u201d, such as a potential blockade by French fishermen, Freeman said he had seen cabinet papers showing that \u201cthe ministry of defence are actively looking at it\u201d.\n\nThe Freight Transport Association(FTA) said it did not expect \u201cwholesale meltdown\u201d but British consumers could expect to see less fresh produce. James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the FTA, said: \u201cThere will be changes to what people can expect to see in the shops, undoubtedly.\u201d\n\nThe FTA plan to hold 140 training sessions in the next few weeks to educate hauliers about the potential paperwork needed. Hookham said questions still remained unanswered, even with the intricate flowchart issued by the Department for Transport to explain customs and border processes.\n\n\u201cThe biggest unknown in our book is what the French and EU will demand in terms of British goods imported into the EU,\u201d he said.\n\nHookham added that the full impact of a no-deal Brexit on Dover, Calais and Kent would probably not be seen until 4 November, due to the public holiday on 1 November.", "description": "Port of Dover chief tells Conservative conference traffic drop would cut \u00a31bn from goods flow", "authors": ["Gwyn Topham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c21564e62040482dc0587bdc624674491fe7f44a/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d1118856692fbda5d473d3b4a6fc6032", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
