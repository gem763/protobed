And it\u2019s now on sale for $169, or $30 off its list price on Amazon.\n\nAlthough it looks like one, the Ring Video Doorbell 2 isn\u2019t a regular doorbell at all. It\u2019s a smart doorbell that can provide you with a 24/7 HD video stream with a wide field of view of all the activity that\u2019s going on around your home.

This is great for taking deliveries when you\u2019re at work, or when you want to confront someone who\u2019s not supposed to be at your house \u2014 like an intruder or unwanted guest.\n\nMeanwhile, the device also features a customizable motion detection system that can alert you to anyone who sets foot on your property, while it works in the evening with infrared night vision. Now you can always be aware of your surroundings even at night.\n\nThe Ring Video Doorbell 2 is compatible with Android and iOS smartphones and tablets, Echo Show and Echo Spot devices, and Windows 10 and MacOS laptops. In addition, it comes with lifetime theft protection, so if someone steals the smart doorbell itself, Ring will replace it for free!\n\nThe Ring Video Doorbell 2 has a 4.2 out of 5 star review rating with over 9,700 reviews. (Photo: Amazon) More\n\nHere\u2019s what reviewers on Amazon have to say about the Ring Video Doorbell 2.\n\n\u201cAfter getting a new door (and frame) but forgetting to add new wiring for a door bell I decided to give the Ring Video Doorbell 2 (because it has a battery) a try,\u201d wrote a reviewer on Amazon. \u201cI wasn't expecting much, but it sure has surprised me. Mounting the doorbell on the provided mount into masonry was straightforward, and the setup was incredibly easy. After a week with our new Ring doorbell we couldn't go back to a normal doorbell again. Being able to monitor the front door live when ever you want is a cool feature, but being notified when someone is within five feet of the door is the real neat feature. Before anyone rings I am already looking at who is at the door and video is clear day or night. Definitely a great product.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has been great. I have Ring scheduled to ignore when I leave and when I get home,\u201d wrote an Amazon reviewer. \u201cIt's tuned for only the areas where an intruder or visitor would pass. The field of vision is wide and outstanding. The video quality via WiFi is outstanding. The battery consumption is measured in weeks (I have a charger with a couple extra batteries on standby). I was able to intercept a pushy neighbor making trouble with my wife via the unit's Mic and Speaker remotely while I was at work - on the FIRST day of ownership! Totally paid for itself in that one instance. The installation and configuration of each was super simple. The iPhone app is great and very easy to use. If you're on the fence about a video doorbell, this is the one to buy!\u201d\n\nShop it: Ring Video Doorbell 2, $169 (was $199), amazon.com\n\nThe reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\n\nRead More from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
