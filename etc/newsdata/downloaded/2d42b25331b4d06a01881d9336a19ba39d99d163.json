Her tracker was pinging west of the Dry Tortugas islands on Monday.\n\nOCEARCH catches and collects samples from marine life before releasing the animals back into the ocean. The group says a big mature female like Unama'ki could lead them to where she gives birth.\n\nOCEARCH tagged 11 white sharks during its 2019 expedition off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Unama'ki was tagged in the area in September \u2014 more than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away from Florida waters.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Naples (Fla.)
