That means another streaming service could carry the show in global markets. The deal also extends the syndication deal between Warner Bros. Television and TBS through 2028.\n\nOther reports from Deadline and Variety suggest the deal for the exclusive streaming rights and extended syndication deal came in at around $600 million. It\u2019s a large discrepancy, but one that might be explained by an extended syndication run on TBS. The five-year deal was originally set to expire in 2024, and Variety notes that \u201cit\u2019s unclear exactly how TBS was compensated for giving up its rights but it ends up with an extension through 2028 on the cable rights.\u201d The Verge has reached out to WarnerMedia for comment.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the biggest deals to date, although part of that has to do with the syndication rights on traditional cable, too. NBCUniversal reportedly paid around $500 million for the rights to stream The Office, and WarnerMedia reportedly spent $425 million reacquiring the rights to Friends. The shows will stream on NBCUniversal\u2019s untitled streaming service and HBO Max, respectively.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that HBO Max will be the exclusive streaming home for this comedy juggernaut when we launch in the spring of 2020,\u201d Robert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia\u2019s entertainment and direct-to-consumer divisions, told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThis show has been a hit virtually around the globe, it\u2019s one of the biggest shows on broadcast television of the last decade, and the fact that we get to bring it to a streaming platform for the first time in the US is a coup for our new offering.\u201d\n\nThe Big Bang Theory was rumored to be one of the hottest TV shows in the bidding wars between streaming players. Alongside it were rumors that Two and a Half Men, also a Chuck Lorre production, would go to HBO Max. The Hollywood Reporter doesn\u2019t suggest if that deal is still being worked on.\n\nAlthough The Big Bang Theory airs on CBS, which has its own streaming competitor called CBS All Access, the show is distributed by Warner Bros. Television. This essentially keeps it in the family. Having a \u201ccomfort\u201d show like The Big Bang Theory for subscribers on a new service \u2014 HBO Max \u2014 is important, but extending syndication rights through traditional cable is a big part of this deal.\n\nThe big question is a cultural one; people worried that HBO\u2019s brand would be diluted by non-HBO content on a streaming service like HBO Max will have to see how a show like The Big Bang Theory plays to its new subscriber base.\n\nUpdate (Sept 17th, 5:30pm ET): The story has been updated to include new reported numbers for the deal. Both Deadline and Variety report the deal could be worth $600 million, but with questions over how much it cost to allow TBS to run an extended syndication run of the series.", "description": "Just one day after Netflix secured the streaming rights to Seinfeld in a deal reportedly worth more than $500 million, WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max has gone one step further, acquiring the rights to The Big Bang Theory in a deal reportedly worth more than $1 billion.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vKTsicsp4i_8D2biLMOmkwWOey0=/0x332:3000x1903/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12757783/112448_0785b2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
