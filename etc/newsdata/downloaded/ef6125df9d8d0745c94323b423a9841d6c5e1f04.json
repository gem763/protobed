Here\u2019s where the real silencing happens in the comedy world:So many would-be comics \u2014 women, people of color, other marginalized groups \u2014 are silenced from the beginnings of their careers. Despite their talent and work ethic, they leave the industry and take their brilliance elsewhere, or perhaps nowhere. Reaching a level in their career where they could even get canceled remains a dream for most.\n\nComedy, like so many of our cultural institutions, remains dominated by men, usually straight and white men. I\u2019ve seen countless versions of Shane Gillis and his material truly spread all over the world, and I\u2019m not about to wrestle the mic from them. I have no problem with anybody speaking their piece, even when it\u2019s lazy and xenophobic. I\u2019m not going to listen, but please, get that off your chest, son! If the most absorbing and insightful thing Mr. Gillis and his buddies have to sound off on is that they find Chinatown to be ugly, then by all means, go right on ahead.\n\nThe problem is when Mr. Gillis \u2014 and the others like him \u2014 frame their words as bold and boundary pushing and brave. What would really be shocking, what would really be exciting and edgy to watch, would be a person climbing down from their safe height and fighting the powerful in a situation where there\u2019s a chance they will lose more than a role on a show. I\u2019m not saying comics need to get into fistfights. We\u2019re too out of shape and anxiety-ridden for that. But a little real bravery wouldn\u2019t hurt.\n\nWhen anyone disagrees with something a comic says, or there are repercussions for their behavior, the comic too often seems genuinely shocked. Your words have consequences. Imagine! What these men need to learn is that just because you want a job on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you deserve one.\n\nExpressing myself through comedy has saved my life. Connecting to others by trying to say what\u2019s happening inside my head \u2014 and make them laugh while doing it \u2014 is a beautiful thing. But when you do express yourself into a mic to a room full of strangers, or into a camera to a country full of strangers, you might want to consider them, too.", "description": "Many of my fellow comics are worrying about freedom of speech.
