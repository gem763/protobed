It\u2019s the least interesting thing about [Batwoman].\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI mean, I even look at her as I look at my own sexuality,\u201d added Rose, who identifies as gay. \u201cI would think my sexuality is the least interesting thing about me. We all identify as something. We wake up in the morning and we don\u2019t think about it, it just is. Being straight and being gay, it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s just love. It\u2019s who you love.\u201d\n\nGay heroes have appeared throughout the CW\u2019s DC shows as supporting characters, but never as a headliner. Batwoman is also known as Kate Kane, billionaire Bruce Wayne\u2019s kid cousin, who becomes a bat-vigilante herself and watches over the night skies of Gotham City. The Australian-born Rose, an MTV personality and model turned actress, was the No. 1 choice by \u201cBatwoman\u201d showrunner Caroline Dries for the cape, cowl and, most important for the comic book die-hards, the red wig.\n\nBut Dries thought Rose \u2014 a budding movie star, recently seen on Netflix in \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d and on film in \u201cJohn Wick 2\u201d and \u201cThe Meg\u201d \u2014 was too big of a name to accept, even if she was offering the keys to her very own Batcave.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou kind of can\u2019t take your eye off of her. [To me,] it\u2019s like asking Angelina Jolie or Kristen Stewart or something,\u201d Dries said. \u201cIn my mind, I was sort of \u2026 looking for the gettable version of Ruby Rose and [someone] who possessed all of her characteristics. That hard edge \u2026 emotionally vulnerable and smart. All those characteristics. I think I was scared to just reach out and say, hey, what about this crazy idea.\u201d\n\nAfter going through \u201ctons\u201d of auditions looking for a Rose alternative, David Rapaport, the CW\u2019s casting director, told Dries she should just go after the real deal.\n\nRose did a bit of soul searching when CW called. Shooting a network TV season often means filming almost year round, leaving a limited window for Rose to make movies. She would have to move from Los Angeles to Vancouver, where most of the CW\u2019s DC shows film.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut ultimately, Rose answered the bat-signal call \u2014 the role was too emotionally appealing to pass up. She tried to think of any upcoming role she\u2019d been offered that could make her feel the same way. There weren\u2019t any.\n\n\u201c[This role is] something that we all wish did exist when we were growing up [watching] television. It would have helped [us] as well as other people feel less alone and less misunderstood or all confused or isolated and different and not unlike many other things that come with being young and gay,\u201d Rose said. She hopes the show will impact people who feel alone \u2014 \u201cand empower them to feel like they\u2019re a superhero too and that they can change the world too.\u201d\n\nIn the \u2018Birds of Prey\u2019 trailer, Harley Quinn is done with the Joker and assembles a whole new squad\n\nRose also has an unexpected connection to the Batman universe: She was close with fellow Aussie Heath Ledger, who passed away before winning an Oscar for playing the Joker in 2008\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just thought, wow, he\u2019s really made it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I got the [Batwoman] opportunity as well I felt, well, I guess I need to pinch myself, because it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\n\nBatwoman first appeared in the pages of DC Comics as Kathy Kane in \u201cDetective Comics\u201d No. 233 on May 22, 1956, as a romantic interest to Batman. Her debut was speculated to have been a push back against the rumor that Batman and Robin were a gay couple, which was perpetuated by Fredric Wertham, who spoke frequently on the effects he thought comic books had on child development.\n\nShe was killed off in 1977, with occasional resurrections typical of superhero story lines. But she didn\u2019t come back for good until June 21, 2006, in \u201c52\u201d No. 7, when she was reintroduced as Kate Kane \u2014 and, for the first time, openly gay, as it was revealed she had a prior relationship with Gotham City police detective Renee Montoya.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2009, she took over for Batman as the lead character of \u201cDetective Comics\u201d for 10 issues (she\u2019s since had two solo series). Writer Greg Rucka and artist J.H. Williams used those issues to retell Batwoman\u2019s origin story, which serves as a heavy influence on the TV show\u2019s first season. The new story focused on her exit from the military after she was outed and her complicated relationship with her father as they dealt with survivors\u2019 guilt from the accidental death of Kate\u2019s mother and sister.\n\nRucka knew a lesbian superhero would make waves, but said he was determined to help create a story that would give Kate Kane staying power.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got her baggage. She has her complex. She has her complications,\u201d Rucka said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, you\u2019re always going to have a hero.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn the TV show, Batwoman will go up against the Joker-esque, Alice in Wonderland-themed character Alice (Rachel Skarsten), with whom she shares a tragic connection. When the cowl comes off, Kate Kane will battle emotions after reuniting with Sophie (Meagan Tandy), the woman she had to let go after being expelled from the military.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe interesting part of [Batwoman] that I don\u2019t really think they explored in the comics [is] \u2026 it\u2019s a show about a girl who is so comfortable with her sexuality and it\u2019s never been a question that she would be in the closet or lie about it,\u201d Dries said. \u201cNow here she is wearing a mask. Lying about who she is. Allowing people to think the wrong things about her. And she has to find a way to reconcile that. \u2026 She\u2019s going into the closet for the first time and trying to figure out where she fits in that paradigm as a superhero.\u201d\n\nBut Rose noted that each time she suits up as Batwoman, the main theme should always be saving the day.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fight crime in a gay way or in a lesbian way,\u201d Rose said. \u201cShe\u2019s a superhero. That\u2019s what she is.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nOur definitive ranking of the Jokers, from Jack Nicholson to Joaquin Phoenix\n\nAfter their CW treatments, Batwoman and Nancy Drew have a hard time being themselves\n\nAD", "description": "The Australian actress stars as Gotham City's newest caped crusader on the CW.", "authors": ["David Betancourt", "Reporter Focusing On Comic Book Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/l0jfSs_cFXT58lEBwvgOff2xTDU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O2RCHDOHWVEJLODUD2WXQBGXP4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
