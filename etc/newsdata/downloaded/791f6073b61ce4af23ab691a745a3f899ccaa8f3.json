The board is recommending that minority shareholders vote in favour of the deal.\n\nHudson\u2019s Bay Co. has tried everything from cutting costs to selling off assets, but nothing had halted its stock\u2019s decline when Baker teamed up with investors, including Rhone Capital and WeWork Property Advisors, to make the offer in June.\n\n\u201cWe believe that improving HBC\u2019s performance will require significant time and patient long-term capital that is better suited in a private company context without the emphasis on short-term results and returns,\u201d Baker said in a statement in June.\n\nActivist investor Land & Buildings Investment Management, which has pushed for change at the iconic retailer, dismissed the group\u2019s original bid as \u201cwoefully inadequate.\u201d\n\nMore to come \u2026", "description": "The price is 9% higher than $9.45 per share offer from the group in June, but minority shareholders still have to vote on deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/hbc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
