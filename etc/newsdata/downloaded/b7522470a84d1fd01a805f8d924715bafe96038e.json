He added the timeline for the launch of libra, which Facebook originally targeted for the first half of next year, could be moved as the group works to comply with regulations.\n\n\"With such a big project and the vision that we're having, launching a few quarters later or before makes no real change,\" he said.", "description": "A top executive from the association overseeing Facebook's cryptocurrency project said he is \"confident\" 100 members will join the group by the time the digital currency launches.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Schulze"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106019124-1563194786186gettyimages-1158030552.jpeg?v=1563468414", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
