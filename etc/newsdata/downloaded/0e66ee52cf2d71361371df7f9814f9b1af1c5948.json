REUTERS/Fayaz Aziz\n\nThe value of the net long dollar position was $15.29 billion in the week ended Sept. 17. The net long dollar position had stood at $13.33 billion last week.\n\nTo be long a currency means traders believe it will rise in value, while being short points to a bearish bias. U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.\n\nIn a wider measure of dollar positioning NETUSDALL= that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the greenback posted a net long position of $15.40 billion in the week ended Sept. 17, compared with $12.58 billion the previous week.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies and it posted its first weekly increase in three, helped by hopes that the Federal Reserve would not lower rates aggressively.\n\nAgainst a favorable economic backdrop, the Fed lowered key lending rates by a quarter point on Wednesday, but signaled a higher bar to further reductions in borrowing costs.\n\nInterest rates futures implied traders saw a 63% chance of another rate cut by year-end, compared with 69% late on Thursday, CME Group\u2019s FedWatch program showed.\n\nWhile interest rate cuts typically weaken the U.S. dollar, because investors often swap dollars for foreign currencies to take advantage of better interest rates in other countries, the recent Fed rate cuts have done little to hurt the greenback.\n\nThe strength of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the world and low interest rates around the globe have led investors to favor the U.S. dollar.\n\nJapanese Yen (Contracts of 12,500,000 yen)\n\n$-2.759 billion\n\n17 Sep 2019 Prior week\n\nweek\n\nLong 50,842 56,579\n\nShort 26,980 23,988\n\nNet 23,862 32,591\n\nEURO (Contracts of 125,000 euros)\n\n$9.488 billion\n\n17 Sep 2019 Prior week\n\nweek\n\nLong 164,272 180,535\n\nShort 232,831 230,377\n\nNet -68,559 -49,842\n\nPOUND STERLING (Contracts of 62,500 pounds sterling)\n\n$6.728 billion\n\n17 Sep 2019 Prior week\n\nweek\n\nLong 21,332 37,903\n\nShort 107,456 130,136\n\nNet -86,124 -92,233\n\nSWISS FRANC (Contracts of 125,000 Swiss francs)\n\n$0.574 billion\n\n17 Sep 2019 Prior week\n\nweek\n\nLong 15,125 16,087\n\nShort 19,681 18,979\n\nNet -4,556 -2,892\n\nCANADIAN DOLLAR (Contracts of 100,000 Canadian dollars)\n\n$-1.497 billion\n\n17 Sep 2019 Prior week\n\nweek\n\nLong 62,004 54,971\n\nShort 42,181 43,448\n\nNet 19,823 11,523\n\nAUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (Contracts of 100,000 Aussie dollars)\n\n$2.751 billion\n\n17 Sep 2019 Prior week\n\nweek\n\nLong 34,566 36,994\n\nShort 74,648 90,008\n\nNet -40,082 -53,014\n\nMEXICAN PESO (Contracts of 500,000 pesos)\n\n$-2.108 billion\n\n17 Sep 2019 Prior week\n\nweek\n\nLong 135,507 126,807\n\nShort 53,881 31,170\n\nNet 81,626 95,637\n\nNEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (Contracts of 100,000 New Zealand dollars)\n\n$2.291 billion\n\n17 Sep 2019 Prior week\n\nweek\n\nLong 15,824 22,490\n\nShort 51,867 52,280\n\nNet -36,043 -29,790", "description": "Speculators boosted their net long bets on the U.S. dollar in the latest week to a five-week high, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.", "authors": ["Saqib Iqbal Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432108725&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J22P", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
