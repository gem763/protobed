Maybe that\u2019s going a little bit too far, but we\u2019re starting to see some responses to that garbage response we just told you about from the NBA on the Houston Rockets\u2019 GM who dared to tweet, \u201cStand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-FL) called the NBA\u2019s statement \u201cshameful\u201d and that they\u2019re \u201cmore interest in money than human rights\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the @NBA is more interested in money than human rights. Tonight\u2019s statement from Commissioner Silver is an absolute joke. The NBA is kowtowing to Beijing to protect their bottom line and disavowing those with the temerity to #standwithHongKong. Shameful! https://t.co/RBPJa04xzK \u2014 Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) October 7, 2019\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) tweeted, \u201cThis is a mistake that they should fix quickly\u201d:\n\nThis is a mistake that they should fix quickly. https://t.co/qNmKNTdksV \u2014 Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) October 7, 2019\n\nAnd Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) pointed out that the \u201cChinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators\u201d:\n\nChinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators \u2013 and NBA wants to \u201cbridge cultural divides\u201d? Cultural divides? https://t.co/d6jXQOzb5F \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 7, 2019\n\nHouston, YOU have a problem. And so does the NBA.\n\nUpdate: Add Ted Cruz to the list:\n\nAs a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong. Now, in pursuit of big $$, the @nba is shamefully retreating. https://t.co/7waMde5KrM \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated.\n\n***\n\nRelated:", "description": "\"It\u2019s clear that the @NBA is more interested in money than human rights.\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/f9657bc0-28c0-42a9-8549-9edce23f58ce.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
