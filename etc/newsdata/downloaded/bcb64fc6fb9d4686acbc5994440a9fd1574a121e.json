Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) announced she was not seeking re-election and fully dedicating herself to her presidential run, she joined Sean Hannity on Fox News to discuss a few hot topics Thursday night. Hannity gave her a chance to respond once more to Hillary Clinton's attacks. Last week, Clinton, the 2016 presidential also-ran, randomly accused Gabbard of being the Russians' favorite candidate. The Hawaii congresswoman responded in a Twitter video, then again on Tucker Carlson's show, and now once more she gave Clinton a piece of her mind during her discussion with Hannity.\n\n\u201cShe is not only calling me a traitor, she is not only trying to smear my character, she's sending a warning out to every veteran, every single American, anyone who stands up the warmongering foreign policies that really are her legacy, that have been so destructive and costly to my brothers and sisters in uniform, because the American people trillions of dollars, and because of so much damage in the war,\u201d Gabbard said.\n\nAs entertaining as her thoughts on Hillary were, Hannity also wanted to know what Gabbard thought of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry in Congress. Republicans have complained of late that Adam Schiff has been blocking them from closed door testimonies, even members of the Judiciary Committee, which launched the inquiry. Although she supports the inquiry, it sounded like Gabbard took the GOP's side in criticizing how the Democrats are handling it.\n\n#NEW: 2020 hopeful Tulsi Gabbard criticizes the lack of transparency in the ongoing impeachment inquiry while appearing on Fox News\u2019 Hannity. pic.twitter.com/0fVhN2o1tP \u2014 Alex Salvi (@alexsalvinews) October 25, 2019\n\n\u201cI don't know what's going on in those closed doors,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cWe as members of Congress do not have access to the information that's being shared. I think the American people deserve to know exactly what the facts are, what the evidence is being presented as this inquiry goes on.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers stormed one of the depositions earlier this week, demanding the Democrats be more transparent. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who's done much of the talking for his colleagues, said they want Democrats to offer President Trump the same due process that Presidents Clinton and Nixon were afforded during their own impeachment inquiries. Democrats said they expect to begin public hearings before Thanksgiving.", "description": ".10/25/2019 11:59:52AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/a0f8da64-8061-4902-b778-424704844bdf.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
