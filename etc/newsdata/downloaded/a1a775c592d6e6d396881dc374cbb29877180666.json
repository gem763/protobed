When the prosecutors are bribable, when your supervisor is afraid to get crossways with the mob, when your fellow citizens have become inured to high levels of dishonesty and violence \u2014 well, where\u2019s the harm in \u201creading\u201d from a blank piece of paper now and then? Or as Montalbano himself put it in \u201cA Voice in the Night\u201d (2012), \u201chow do you remove s--- from the middle of the street without a pooper-scooper? You have no choice but to use your hands and get them dirty.\u201d\n\nAndrea Camilleri, Italian author of Montalbano detective series, dies at 93\n\nIn \u201cThe Other End of the Line,\u201d Montalbano\u2019s 25th outing, the inspector takes his latest case personally. Forced to get a new suit for a wedding he has promised to attend with his longtime companion, Livia, the inspector puts himself in the hands of a highly recommended local tailor, Elena Biasini. To his surprise, the fitting is a pleasant experience, mostly because Elena is so attractive and engaging. Despite having been in the same room with her only a couple of (wholly innocent) times, Montalbano is deeply disturbed when Elena is found dead in her office, her body raked by cuts from a sharp tool of some sort. One of his colleagues poses the problem succinctly: \u201cShe was a woman who had a gift for being liked by everyone. She\u2019d given work to so many people in town. She wasn\u2019t a homewrecker, didn\u2019t make married women jealous, or bust anyone\u2019s chops. And yet, it\u2019s also clear that this was a crime of passion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is no shortage of suspects, including one of Elena\u2019s ex-boyfriends and a young employee whose infatuation with her became so pronounced that she had to fire him. Montalbano spends a lot of time checking on their alibis; as he does so, troubling aspects of Elena\u2019s past begin to surface.\n\nMontalbano\u2019s creator made a career in the theater, notably as a teacher of play-directing in Rome, and his gift for dialogue reflects that background. He was also lucky enough to find a fine translator, the American poet Stephen Sartarelli, who is especially good at rendering Sicilian dialect and general verbal muddle in English. Take, for example, the verbally challenged Catarella, the cop shop\u2019s male receptionist, who has been minding the murder victim\u2019s cat at Montalbano\u2019s expense and now has a question for him.\n\n\u201cI wannit a tell yiz. \u2019at F\u2019renix [a local store] axed me t\u2019ax yiz if y\u2019er also gonna pay for the cat\u2019s letter.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLetter? What letter?\u201d\n\n\u201cChief, I swear, I tried a ax \u2019em, but I dint unnastand. \u2019Ey jess said sum\u2019n \u2019at sounded like a \u2018cat letter.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWas it cat litter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, \u2019a\u2019ss it, Chief! \u2019A\u2019ss azackly right!\u201d\n\nAfter this farrago, what can Montalbano do but agree to foot the bill for the letter/litter, too?\n\nIn an author\u2019s note at the end of \u201cThe Other End of the Line,\u201d Camilleri thanks one Valentina Alferj, who helped him write the book \u201cnot only physically but also by intervening creatively in its drafting. In other words, now that I am blind, I would not have been able to write this story (nor those that I hope will follow) without her.\u201d Camilleri died at age 93 in July of this year, but at least one more novel did follow (it\u2019s due out in the United States next spring), and possibly there are more. Let\u2019s hope so, because for anyone who likes mysteries with good plotting and characterization, vivid local color, and sparkling language, the Montalbano series is azackly right.\n\nDennis Drabelle is a former mysteries editor of Book World.\n\nTHE OTHER END OF THE LINE\n\nBy Andrea Camilleri\n\nTranslated from the Italian by Stephen Sartarelli\n\nPenguin. 304 pp. Paperback, $16.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cThe Other End of the Line\u201d captures the voices of Camilleri\u2019s native Italy.", "authors": ["Dennis Drabelle"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Jf8LD4OlGuDt620QMT1p__idax4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OIWL4XFIUMI6TEQUERXFSTPF2U.jpg"}
