I gave one to my dad and he\u2019s somebody who just, you know, the idea of eating some kind of fake beef is just not his world at all. When he was halfway through eating it, I said, \u201cYou know that\u2019s not beef.\u201d He was like, \u201cYou could have fooled me; it\u2019s delicious.\u201d He loved it. They changed their recipe at the beginning of this year and it\u2019s even better now; it actually kind of caramelizes like beef. People always say, \u201cWhy do vegetarians want to eat stuff that tastes like meat?\u201d I didn\u2019t become a vegetarian because I didn\u2019t like the taste of meat; I became a vegetarian because I didn\u2019t like the idea of animals being killed. I mean, think about what it takes to raise a cow; all the water and food that you have to give a cow can be used to give to people. Cut out the middleman and the middle animal in this relationship, I think it\u2019s environmentally very sound.\n\nI don\u2019t judge people who eat meat \u2014 people in my family do \u2014 it\u2019s not about that. But I think they\u2019ve been raised to do it unconsciously, and I think you should at least think about whether or not you want to do it. I mean, everybody loves hamburgers. I ate them as a kid; I ate them as a young adult. You love the taste and the fun of it \u2014 and you get all of that through these. I like mine with just ketchup and cheese, definitely cheese.", "description": "Michael Imperioli, best known for his role on \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d shares the ten things he can\u2019t live without, including musical albums by Diamanda Gal\u00e1s and Jesse Malin, personal essay collections by Kathy Acker and Lydia Lunch, and Beyond Burgers.", "authors": ["Michael Imperioli", "Simone Kitchens"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/10/10-michael-imperioli-wiclw.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
