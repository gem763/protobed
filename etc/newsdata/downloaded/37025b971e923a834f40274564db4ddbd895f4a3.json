In Israel, countless Israelis have literally never stepped foot in a synagogue, but instead, express their belonging to their people through their expressions of peoplehood, not least by their choice to live in a Jewish state.\n\nIsraelis right and left, religious and secular, still overwhelmingly believe in the importance and legitimacy of Israel as a distinctly Jewish state, in which the national narrative is Jewish history, the holidays that define the calendar year are Jewish, public religious symbols are overwhelmingly Jewish and the spoken language is the language of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nIsraeli Arabs voted in greater numbers in this election, and now, at long last, represent a formidable parliamentary bloc. They appear ready to become more involved in the political process than they have in decades. But the subject they avoid is whether or not they are willing to accept the notion that Israel is not only democratic, but Jewish.\n\nThis, too, could complicate American Jews\u2019 view of Israel. If and when even seemingly moderate Jewish Israeli voices object publicly to including Israel\u2019s Arab Parliament members in the coalition, American Jews \u2014 imbued with America\u2019s commitment to universalism \u2014 will most likely see a blemish in a democracy\u2019s obligation to be ethnically blind. Meantime, Israelis will see themselves seeking to perpetuate the purpose for which their state was created.\n\nAmerica granted the Jews who came to its shores a chance to sidestep history. History was a \u201cnightmare,\u201d says von Humboldt in Saul Bellow\u2019s Nobel-Prize winning \u201cHumboldt\u2019s Gift.\u201d He had come to America to get \u201ca good night\u2019s rest.\u201d Zionism sought no such rest. Jews who chose Zionism sought a re-entry into history, with all the complexity and even ugliness that history and power invariably entail.\n\nAmerican Jews are repulsed by the interminable conflict with the Palestinians, and chant \u201cEnd the Occupation,\u201d often without regard for the risks Israelis might have to assume to make that happen. Most Israelis would like the conflict to be over, too, but if perpetuating the unique project that is the Jewish state means that the conflict will continue until the Palestinians demonstrate (not just declare) an to end their drive to destroy the Jewish state, Israelis will unhappily bear that, too.\n\nIf the rift between American Jews and Israel is to be healed, salvation will come not in the form of Benny Gantz or any other prime minister, but in beginning an overdue conversation between the world\u2019s two largest Jewish communities, to deepen our understanding of each other\u2019s differences, successes and vulnerabilities, in the hopes that we can learn from the best that each has to offer. In a world that is darkening for the Jews once again, we need each other now more than ever.\n\nDaniel Gordis (@danielgordis) is Koret Distinguished Fellow at Shalem College in Jerusalem.
