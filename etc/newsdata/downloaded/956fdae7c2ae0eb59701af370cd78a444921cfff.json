It\u2019s a fraud.\u201d After months of restraint, Ms. Pelosi last month charged Mr. Trump with betraying the nation\u2019s security by seeking to enlist a foreign government to damage a political rival for his own gain.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s remarks came after two nights of raucous campaign rallies, one in the progressive city of Minneapolis, and another in the deep-red district of Lake Charles, La. But at an official White House event on Saturday night, Mr. Trump delivered an almost indistinguishable message from behind a podium with a presidential seal.", "description": "For the third night in a row, the president delivered a version of his combative response to the start of the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Annie Karni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/12/us/politics/12dc-trump/merlin_162602700_f7731381-9c0f-4104-abad-92ea9b16eb18-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
