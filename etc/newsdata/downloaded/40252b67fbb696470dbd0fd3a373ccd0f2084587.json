Adam Schiff of Intelligence, Eliot Engel of Foreign Affairs and Elijah Cummings of Oversight.\n\nThe subpoena capped a breakneck day of political drama as Trump and Democratic leaders lobbed legal and rhetorical bombshells at each other over the intensifying Ukraine scandal.\n\nDemocrats gave the White House a two-week deadline of Oct. 18 to comply with their demand, and they warned Mulvaney \u2014 a former House member himself \u2014 that his \u201cfailure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the behest of the President or others at the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstructing the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President.\"\n\nDemocrats had previously warned that they would issue the subpoena for Ukraine-related documents, with Cummings even threatening the move earlier in the week if the White House didn\u2019t provide the material by Friday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Friday said the \u201csubpoena changes nothing \u2014 just more document requests, wasted time, and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the President did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump on Friday spoke with House Republican leaders, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, and \u201cemphasized that Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Schiff are deliberately misleading the American people about the truth, and are trampling over procedure and precedent to advance their political goals.\u201d\n\nTrump and other administration officials \u2014 as well as House GOP leaders \u2014 have challenged the legitimacy of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry on the grounds that the full House has not voted to begin the proceedings, as it did during previous presidential impeachment hearings.\n\nBut Schiff, Engel and Cummings insist a vote of the full House is not necessary to initiate an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"The vote of the full House is not required to launch an impeachment inquiry, and there is no authority for the White House to make such a claim,\" the three chairmen asserted. \"There is no such requirement in the Constitution or in House rules.\"\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, in an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's editorial board on Friday, wouldn't commit to holding such a vote, saying it wasn't necessary to move forward with the probe.\n\n\"If we want to do it, we'll do it. If we don't, we don't. But we're certainly not going to do it because of the president,\" Pelosi said.\n\nDemocrats also sent a request on Friday to Vice President Mike Pence seeking documents related to Trump\u2019s open solicitation of assistance from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to target Joe Biden, whose son Hunter worked for a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nAnd the intelligence community\u2019s top watchdog provided corroborating details to lawmakers about a bombshell whistleblower complaint involving Trump which has quickly become the central focus of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee when Democrats sent the request to Pence.\n\nDemocrats who emerged from the classified hearing appeared satisfied with Atkinson\u2019s level of cooperation after more than six hours of testimony, indicating that he provided information corroborating the whistleblower\u2019s complaint centering on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Zelensky to investigate Biden.\n\nIn a statement, Schiff said the panel \"explored with the IG through documents and testimony the reasons why he found the whistleblower complaint to be both urgent and credible. Now that we have all seen the call record, we can see that the IG\u2019s determination was correct in both respects.\"\n\n\"[Atkinson] just cemented the integrity of how thorough he was to corroborate,\u201d added Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), a member of the Intelligence panel. \u201cLet\u2019s put this in perspective, folks. What the inspector general said last time was, the whistleblower pulled the fire alarm. We have now seen the smoke and the fire.\u201d\n\nQuigley said Atkinson is \u201ccontinuing to protect the whistleblower,\u201d whose credibility has come under attack from Trump and his allies. Atkinson deemed the complaint \u201curgent\u201d and credible after his review.\n\nMost lawmakers were tight-lipped as they emerged from the closed-door hearing. But Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told reporters that Atkinson spoke about the process of his investigation.\n\n\u201cHe made a very compelling case,\u201d Speier said.\n\nAtkinson\u2019s testimony came the day after a former top envoy to Ukraine provided lawmakers with damning text messages suggesting that the White House was withholding critical military assistance unless Ukraine\u2019s president launched investigations targeting Trump\u2019s political adversaries.\n\nAtkinson\u2019s appearance before the panel on Friday was his first since the whistleblower complaint was released publicly, and lawmakers were eager to hear how he handled the whistleblower's claims. It was unclear whether Atkinson would share his full report with the committee, but Democrats were insisting on it.\n\nAtkinson returned to Capitol Hill as House Democrats ramped up their impeachment inquiry, issuing subpoenas for witness testimony and documents to better understand Trump\u2019s efforts to solicit foreign assistance to damage Biden, a potential rival in 2020.\n\nIf the committee obtains all or parts of Atkinson\u2019s report, Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry could speed up dramatically. In the meantime, the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight panels have been investigating Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelensky and the extent to which State Department officials were assisting Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, who was in contact with Ukrainian officials regarding Biden.\n\nThe committees\u2019 joint letter to Pence on Friday demanded documents related to Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, during which Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to launch an investigation targeting Biden and his son Hunter. The request has a deadline of Oct. 15, and a subpoena could be issued if Pence doesn\u2019t meet their demand.\n\nThe Democrats are seeking information from Pence \u201cabout any role [he] may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian president,\u201d the chairmen wrote.\n\nDemocrats also noted news reports that a member of Pence's staff participated in the call between Trump and Zelensky, documents Pence may have reviewed about the call, and the fact that Pence met with the Ukrainian president and reportedly discussed the administration\u2019s hold on U.S. military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nIn response, Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Waldman said, \u201cIt does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the 'do nothing' Democrats to call attention to their partisan impeachment.\u201d\n\nFriday was also deadline for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to comply with a Democratic subpoena for documents related to State Department officials\u2019 involvement with Giuliani as he sought to coordinate his efforts with Ukrainian officials. And Democrats have subpoenaed documents from Giuliani and set an Oct. 15 deadline for him to turn over the material.\n\n\n\nPompeo did not comply with the subpoena, although Democratic aides said State Department officials had reached out to the three committees about the issue.\n\n\u201cSecretary Pompeo has failed to meet the deadline to produce documents required by the subpoena,\" said a Democratic aide. \"However, the State Department has contacted the committees on this matter and we hope the department will cooperate in full promptly. Apart from the outstanding subpoena, we look forward to hearing from Ambassadors Sondland and Yovanovitch next week.\u201d\n\nKurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, testified behind closed doors for nearly nine hours on Thursday about his knowledge of Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Zelensky to investigate Biden and other political opponents. In one of the messages released by House investigators late Thursday night, Volker suggested that Zelensky\u2019s visit to Washington is contingent on him launching an investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, a top priority of Trump and his allies.\n\nTrump and his allies have sought to undermine the whistleblower\u2019s credibility by asserting that the individual did not have firsthand knowledge of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky.\n\nHowever, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire told lawmakers last week that the complaint was \u201cin alignment\u201d with the rough transcript of the call, and whistleblower complaints do not require firsthand knowledge of the events in question. In a statement earlier this week, Atkinson pushed back on those claims, saying the whistleblower \u201cstated on the form that he or she possessed both first-hand and other information.\u201d\n\nWhistleblower protection laws require that a complaint be turned over to Congress when the inspector general deems it \u201curgent,\u201d as Atkinson did in this case. But Maguire withheld the complaint from the House and Senate Intelligence committees after consulting with the Justice Department and the White House counsel\u2019s office.\n\nAtkinson opposed Maguire\u2019s decision and later briefed the Intelligence Committee. But Atkinson was unable to discuss the substance of the complaint during that briefing because Maguire had not yet authorized it to be released.\n\nIn recent days, Trump and his allies have seized on the revelation that a Democratic staffer on the Intelligence Committee had brief contact with the whistleblower before he or she filed the complaint. It\u2019s part of a larger GOP strategy to deflect criticisms from the president and instead hammer Schiff and Pelosi over how they're conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHouse GOP leaders are demanding a full House vote authorizing the inquiry \u2014 which Pelosi has rejected \u2014 while suggesting Schiff and his aides improperly communicated with the whistleblower before the complaint was filed.\n\n\u201cChairman Schiff should be disqualified from running an investigation where his committee \u2014 members or staff \u2014 are fact witnesses about contact with the whistleblower and the whistleblower process,\u201d Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) said after emerging from Friday's hearing in the basement of the Capitol.\n\nBut Schiff\u2019s staff has maintained that it is normal for whistleblowers to contact the Intelligence Committee for guidance before submitting a formal complaint. A committee spokesman said earlier this week that the committee did not \u201creview or receive the complaint in advance.\" The whistleblower was told to contact Atkinson's office instead, Democrats said.\n\nSenate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Atkinson\u2019s briefing before his panel last week was \u201cextremely helpful at trying to fill in some of the things we haven't been able to pickup from published documents.\u201d\n\nDaniel Lippman and Anita Kumar contributed to this report.", "description": "They also demanded Ukraine documents from Vice President Mike Pence.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "John Bresnahan", "Heather Caygle", "David M.
