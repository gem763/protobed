While this is down from the 10% annual growth Amex found in Q3 2018, it matches the 8% annual jump it posted in Q2 2019.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nNotably, this marks the second straight quarter where Amex's US billed business growth increased or remained the same, and since this comes after two straight quarters of decelerating growth \u2014 when it dropped from 10% YoY in Q3 2018 to 7% by Q1 2019 \u2014 it may mean Amex has avoided a prolonged negative trend.\n\nThe company's rewards spending remained its largest expense by far, but its growth hasn't surged to new heights. It reached $2.61 billion this quarter, up 9% annually. This matches the 9% YoY bump the expense saw in Q2 2019, and is down from an 11% annual increase in Q3 2018. That Amex has been able to find consistent growth in its US billed business without drastically ramping up its rewards spending is a good sign for its ability to succeed going forward.\n\nNow, Amex is set to revamp its rewards programs for two key parts of its business, which could boost its performance in the future.\n\nIt's announced a corporate program that could increase spend from businesses and startups in particular. The program includes new benefits for spending with Uber, Clear, and Hilton that should make Amex cards more attractive for corporate travel, and an updated app for corporate cardholders that might make Amex cards easier to use. Amex is also introducing a program explicitly for startups that can help them avoid having their spending impact their personal credit score, and \"dynamic spending capacity\" that could give them greater flexibility. The new corporate program could bring in new cardholders and entice them to spend more with Amex, improving its billed business.\n\nAmex recently revealed a new set of rewards for the Delta SkyMiles American Express card portfolio, which is part of its largest cobrand partnership. The new rewards apply to its Blue tier consumer cards and its Gold, Platinum, and Reserve level cards for both consumers and business owners, and include perks like earning double miles at restaurants and US supermarkets. This move can be extremely impactful for Amex if it increases spending on the cards since the portfolio already accounts for 8% of its cards spending and 20% of its loans.\n\nTo account for potentially higher rewards costs with its new perks, Amex may need to bring in revenue through tactics like higher annual fees, something it's already doing with its Delta portfolio. Raising annual fees could scare some businesses and consumers off from using Amex's cards, but if it wants to avoid rewards expenses negating the gains it might get from its more attractive offerings, it might need to consider doing so for a number of cardholders.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
