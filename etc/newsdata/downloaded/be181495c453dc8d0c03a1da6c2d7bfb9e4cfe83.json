National Review. It\u2019s our battle, yes, but it\u2019s very much yours too, because the consequences of a courtroom defeat will be serious (an understatement if there ever was one) for all Americans. Hence we turn to you again for your financial support, to help us underwrite these critical legal efforts, on our behalf and yours, and also to help NR\u2019s broader task of pouring unrelenting conservative fire on reinvigorated socialism, its full-throated advocates, and the apostles of Alinsky who prowl the world, seeking the ruin of souls and of America as our founders envisioned it.\n\nOn Mann: Right now, the quite liberal District of Columbia Court of Appeals \u2014 which has refused to toss the case despite the Supreme Court\u2019s clear and plentiful established rulings about free speech \u2014 has ordered this case to go to a jury trial. The seven-year process of reaching this verdict has come with a price tag of well over a million dollars. So far. That may be a down payment on the battle\u2019s possibly enormous final tally.\n\nThe slow, meandering legal process (here is our most recent editorial, which provides the case synopsis) has nothing on the matter\u2019s massive, looming impact on a fundamental right possessed no less by NR magazine editors than by every other American. Earlier this year, after all appeal options with the D.C. court had been exhausted, NR turned to the U.S. Supreme Court to ask the justices to hear the case and to protect free speech. Our pending cert petition \u2014 which SCOTUS will rule on, possibly this week (a yes means it will take the case, a no means the trial proceeds in the D.C. court) \u2014 made several important points. Please do read it. But here is the heart of its argument:\n\nYet, in this case, the D.C. Court of Appeals held that a jury could impose defamation liability on a conservative media outlet for opining that the risks of climate change were being overhyped by misleading statistical analyses. Petitioner National Review, Inc. published a blog post that criticized the so-called \u201chockey stick\u201d graph created by Respondent Dr. Michael Mann, a scientist who is a leading voice in the climate-change debate. The validity of the graph has itself been the focus of intense argument, with its opponents objecting to its cherry-picking of data and apples-to-oranges comparisons. The blog post at issue decried the graph as \u201cdeceptive\u201d and \u201cfraudulent,\u201d calling its creation \u201cwrongdoing\u201d and \u201cmisconduct.\u201d Remarkably, the Court of Appeals concluded that a jury could treat those statements as \u201cprovably false\u201d representations of fact and impose liability, without offending the First Amendment. In that court\u2019s view, a reasonable jury \u201ccould\u201d construe the statements as conveying not only a subjective and non-falsifiable value judgment about the graph\u2019s legitimacy, but also some (never-specified) objective, verifiable fact about Mann\u2019s conduct or his \u201cintegrity.\u201d In view of that supposed possible construction, the court remanded the defamation case for discovery and trial.\n\nIf the D.C. Court of Appeals ruling is allowed to stand, it will mean this: If someone doesn\u2019t like what you say \u2014 yeah, you \u2014 and doesn\u2019t like your opinion, that someone, bogusly aggrieved, can take you to court, one that is specially scouted and selected, and there a jury will be empowered to determine whether your opinion is right or wrong. And on a larger scale, to determine the rightness or wrongness of . . . climate-change policy? Immigration? Tax policy? Trade policy? What\u2019s next: your Second Amendment rights? Your freedom to assemble? To worship? Is it that hard to conceive that a jury in a cherry-picked location might hold, Constitution be damned, a respected creed illegal, an ancient dietary practice verboten, a sacred rite wrong, a venerable charity a hate group? When will habeas be corpsed?\n\nHyperbolic language, this? Nope. This process puts our rights under threat, our voice behind a gag.\n\nA few weeks back, Wall Street Journal columnist William McGurn nailed the consequences of this fight NR is waging:\n\nIn some senses the Mann suit may represent the perfect storm for litigation because so many consider climate science beyond question. The opinion of the appellate court, for example, carries the whiff of a religious authority rendering final judgment \u2014 the idea being that university faculties and other authorities have spoken so debate must be closed. There\u2019s also the venue. This lawsuit didn\u2019t go through the federal courts but through D.C.\u2019s equivalent of state courts, where judges and juries probably aren\u2019t the friendliest to conservatives. With so many publications, think tanks and activists keeping offices in the nation\u2019s capital, it isn\u2019t hard to see how Washington could quickly become the venue for similar lawsuits. The larger point is that while so-called climate deniers might be the first defendants, they are unlikely to be the last. If the D.C. ruling stands, National Review asks in its petition to the high court, what\u2019s to prevent, say, Charles Koch from suing Greenpeace for accusing him of having funded a \u201cjunk study . . . loaded with lies and misrepresentations of actual climate change science\u201d? Or Steve Bannon from founding a deep-pocketed organization to sue Trump opponents, and then shopping for a venue where a friendly jury might agree that an over-the-top opinion is a defamatory statement of fact?\n\nWhether the Supreme Court takes the case or it proceeds to trial in the D.C. court, there will be significant financial costs \u2014 above and beyond what our insurers bear \u2014 to NR. This being a mutual fight, we ask our readers, and any and all conservatives, and any and all believers in a vigorous First Amendment, to donate to our 2019 Fall webathon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can do this with assurance that NR\u2019s combativeness is just as keen outside the courtroom. Look at some recent issues of the magazine: The current issue is an all-out take-down of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s most egregious policy prescriptions; the issue prior to that focused on defending your Second Amendment rights; and earlier in the year we carpet-bombed socialism right after making a full-throated defense of free markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis place built and maintained by Bill Buckley \u2014 its mandate to defend and expand conservatism, to hound and excoriate leftism, entrusted by Bill to us \u2014 remains vital. The fact that it remains is because of the help of many over the years. That need for help remains. There are plentiful reasons right now to come to NR\u2019s aid, to join it in the foxhole and the cockpit, to stand with it on the ramparts and at the deck guns. The enemies of our beliefs \u2014 and yes, they are enemies \u2014 are plentiful, financed, and determined. We aim to withstand them and defeat them.\n\n\u201cWe\u201d includes you. In advance of your selfless generosity, take our hand as we help you on top of the barricades, and accept our sincere thanks.\n\n(Donations to the 2019 Fall Webathon can be made here.
