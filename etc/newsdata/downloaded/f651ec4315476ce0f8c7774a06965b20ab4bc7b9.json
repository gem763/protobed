Karl also said that if Joe Biden's son, Hunter, weren\u2019t politically connected then he probably wouldn\u2019t have been in a position to profit from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHunter Biden, as far as I know, doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience with Ukraine, I think if his name were Hunter Smith he probably wouldn\u2019t have been getting paid,\u201d Karl said.\n\nCo-host Meghan McCain then pointed out that reporters act like \u201cthe end of the world is coming\u201d on a regular basis and asked Karl why this latest story was any different.\n\n\u201cI think that this is significant and this is a little bit different and very easy to understand. You have what the president himself has already acknowledged, which is even if there was no quid pro quo, even if he wasn\u2019t holding that aid over the head of the president of Ukraine, merely bringing up your political opponent in a conversation with a newly elected president, any president of a foreign country, is going to be seen as problematic,\u201d Karl said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "It\u2019s was a big day for corporate synergy on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThe View\u201d Monday when the network\u2019s chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl joined the daytime gabfest to explain the controversy over a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
