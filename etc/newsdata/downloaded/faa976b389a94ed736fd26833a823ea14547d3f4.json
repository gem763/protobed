A third, released in March 2018, depicted a similar encounter.\n\nEveryone who watched \u2014 including the pilots who filmed them \u2014 had the same question: What, exactly, are these things?\n\nLast week, a Navy official publicly called these mysterious objects \u201cUnidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP),\u201d giving name to the inscrutable little dots and reigniting scrutiny around the unidentified flying objects (a term the Navy does not want to use even though the objects that are flying cannot be identified.)\n\n[The government admits it studies UFOs. So about those Area 51 conspiracy theories \u2026]\n\n\u201cThe Navy designates the objects contained in these videos as unidentified aerial phenomena,\u201d Joseph Gradisher, spokesman for the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare, told the Black Vault blog, a massive civilian repository of government documents mostly obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nGradisher further explained that \u201cThe \u2018Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\u2019 terminology is used because it provides the basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorized/unidentified aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges.\u201d\n\nBlack Vault\u2019s founder, John Greenewald Jr., told The Washington Post that he believed the remarks were significant because, for the first time, the Navy acknowledged the existence of the objects in the videos on the record and admitted that the department cannot identify them. Greenewald also reported that the videos were not originally intended for public release.\n\nBecause of this revelation, Gradisher\u2019s comments to Black Vault have ricocheted across the Internet this week, getting picked up everywhere from Popular Mechanics (\u201cThe Navy Says Those UFO Videos Are Real\u201d) to the front page of the Drudge Report (\u201cUPDATE: Navy says It\u2019s Tracking UFOs \u2026\u201d).\n\n\u201cThe most powerful military doesn\u2019t know what these objects are,\u201d Greenewald said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean aliens, or that they don\u2019t have some plausible logical explanation. But \u2026 admitting that they see things in the sky and they can\u2019t identify them, that to me is the most amazing part of this.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent interview with The Post, Gradisher downplayed the significance of the moniker, saying that \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d was not a new term and that the Navy preferred it to the more popular \u201cUFO\u201d because the latter comes with cultural stigma that might discourage pilots from reporting such incidents for fear of being labeled, well, kooky.\n\nThis year, the Navy overhauled its guidelines for reporting these UAPs to encourage pilots to flag disturbances, which have been occurring regularly since 2014. Gradisher said one possible explanation could be the rise of unmanned aerial systems (or UAS, if you can handle another abbreviation) such as quadrocopters, a kind of drone easily available to the public.\n\n\u201cAll of this is about incursions into our training ranges by what we\u2019re calling UAPs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese incursions cause a hazard to the safety of our aviators and the security of our operators, and that\u2019s what the Navy\u2019s investigating, these range incursions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese three videos that are out there \u2026 reflect three reports of incursions into our training ranges\u201d that occurred in 2004 and 2015, he said.\n\n[Head of Pentagon\u2019s secret \u2018UFO\u2019 office sought to make evidence public]\n\nThe three videos, titled \u201cFLIR1,\u201d \u201cGimbal\u201d and \u201cGoFast,\u201d were initially released by the New York Times and an organization called To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science, which \u201cengages with global citizens to investigate the outer edges of science and unconventional thinking\u201d and was founded by a former member of Blink 182.\n\nThat the eerie footage had emerged along with revelations about a secret and since-shelved Pentagon division known as the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program did not exactly staunch speculation that a less-earthly culprit was to blame for these \u201cincursions.\u201d On YouTube, the footage has been watched millions of times.\n\nBlack Vault\u2019s founder, Greenewald, would not speculate whether Gradisher\u2019s comments were further proof of extraterrestrial life, saying he prefers to stick to what the documents he\u2019s obtained via FOIA requests tell him. But the subject of UAPs, or UFOs, or whatever we\u2019re calling them, continues to fascinate him.\n\nThe truth is still out there, and for Greenewald, there was only one way to find it: \u201cWe just have to keep asking those questions.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nHow angry pilots got the Navy to stop dismissing UFO sightings\n\nHalf a million people signed up to storm Area 51. What happens if they actually show?\n\nPerspective: UFOs exist and everyone needs to adjust to that fact\n\nHe got 2 million people to say they\u2019d storm Area 51. Now he\u2019s planning an alien festival.", "description": "The Navy admits it doesn't know what the flying objects in some videos are, but it doesn't want to associate its investigations or concerns for pilot safety with speculations on alien life.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk", "September At Pm", "Kayla Epstein Is The Social Media Editor For National At The Washington Post.
