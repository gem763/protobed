The Russell 2000 index , which suffered a bearish \"death cross (link)\" on Thursday, was on track to shed 2.1%.\n\nWhat's driving the stock market?\n\nThe 136,000 new U.S. jobs created in September were slightly below the 150,000 forecast by economists surveyed by MarketWatch, but revisions to July and August job growth showed that the U.S. economy added 38,000 more jobs in those months than previously thought. The average job growth of 157,000 during the past three months is enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down, even as it illustrates a steady slowing of job growth in the U.S. labor market.\n\n\"This is the classic definition of a 'Goldilocks' report,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors told MarketWatch. \"The rate of job growth is slowing, but the labor market continues to be a strength of the U.S. economy.\"\n\nAverage hourly earnings for workers ticked down 1 cent to $28.09, after rising 11 cents in August. Yearly growth in wages fell to 2.9% from 3.2% in August.\n\n\"The one concern is that average hourly earnings ticked down a bit,\" Arone said. \"Some might take this as a positive as because wages aren't rising enough to feed into inflation, and it will allow the Fed to cut rates again.\"\n\nInvestors are placing a slightly lower chance that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting ending Oct. 30, with the Fed-funds futures markets pricing an 80.7% chance of a cut later this month, down from about 90% before the report was released. The market is still placing a more than 91% chance of a cut by the end of 2019, however.\n\nThe jobs data hold particular significance after reports about American factory activity showed evidence of contraction in September, with the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing report on Tuesday showing the weakest reading in about a decade (link) and an ISM nonmanufacturing report on Thursday, coming in at 52.6% (link) -- the weakest level in about three years.\n\nFederal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida late Thursday played down the chances of a near-term recession. He said the risk remains low \"with appropriate monetary policy,\" speaking at a question-and-answer session sponsored by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nClarida offered no explicit forward guidance about whether the Fed would cut rates again at its meeting on Oct. 29-30.\n\nInvestors were also watching developments on the trade front, and stocks added to their gains late Friday morning after President Trump told reporters at the White House (link) that there was \"a very good chance\" that a deal could be reached between the U.S. and China. The two sides are set to meet for high level talks in Washington Oct. 10-11.\n\nA parade of other Fed speakers also is in focus, headlined by a 2 p.m. talk from Fed chair Powell, where he will deliver opening remarks about employment and price stability at a Fed hosted event.\n\nBefore that, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren spoke at 8:30 a.m. at an event in his home region, Atlanta Fed boss Raphael Bostic gave remarks at 10:25 a.m. in New Orleans, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will talk at 12:45 p.m. at an event in his district. Capping off the Friday appearances are Fed Gov. Lael Brainard, who will moderate a panel at 2:10 p.m., and Fed Vice-Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles, who moderates a panel at 4 p.m.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nShares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) rose after a report (link) in the Nikkei Asian Review that the company has asked suppliers to ramp up production of its latest iPhone 11 model by 10%, or 8 million units.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp. (COST) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close Thursday, with earnings and revenue falling short of Wall Street estimates, though same-store sales growth of 5.1% matched expectations.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell about one basis point to 1.522%.\n\nGold prices retreated (link) after settling higher on Thursday. Gold for December delivery fell $3.90 to $1,510.10 an ounce on Comex.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude-oil for November delivery rose 44 cents (link), to $52.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nIn Asia overnight Wednesday, the Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.1% as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam banned protesters from wearing masks in a hardening of the government's stance on the territory's most disruptive crisis since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. The mask ban takes effect Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan's Nikkei 225 meanwhile, gained 0.3% after a 2% fall on Thursday. European stocks were mostly higher, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.7%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 12:09 ET (16:09 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
