When he was pulled over, he refused a breathalyzer test and was hospitalized. His blood-alcohol level was 200 mg/dL, which can occur after consuming 10 or so alcoholic drinks.\n\n\"For years, no one believed him. The police, doctors, nurses and even his family told him he wasn't telling the truth, that he must be a closet-drinker.\" \u2014 Dr. Fahad Malik\n\nDespite insisting he hadn\u2019t consumed any alcohol, \u201cthe hospital personnel and police refused to believe him when he repeatedly denied alcohol ingestion,\u201d the report reads.\n\nFollowing the arrest, the man sought treatment at a clinic in Ohio. A stool sample revealed the presence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of yeast often used in winemaking, baking and beer brewing. To definitely say whether or not he had ABS, doctors gave him a carbohydrate-rich meal and then monitored his blood-alcohol levels. Eight hours later, his levels raised to 57 mg/dL, they wrote. (ABS occurs when the body turns high-sugar foods or carbohydrates into alcohol, causing intoxication, according to Healthline.)\n\nThe man was treated for the condition at the Ohio clinic and his symptoms improved. But a few weeks later, he reported having ABS \u201cflares\u201d \u2014 one of which resulted in a fall that caused a bleed inside his brain. He was hospitalized as a result.\n\n\u201cHere too, the medical staff refused to believe that he did not drink alcohol despite his persistent denials,\u201d the researchers wrote in the report.\n\nDesperate for help, the man eventually was connected with physicians with the Richmond University Medical Center. Following a series of tests, anti-fungal and other treatments improved the man\u2019s ABS symptoms \u2014 excluding the one time he ate pizza and drank soda resulting in a \u201csevere ABS relapse,\u201d they wrote.\n\nEventually, the man\u2019s symptoms dissipated and he was even allowed to gradually re-introduce carbohydrates into his diet. Now, nearly two years following treatment, he \u201cremains asymptomatic and has resumed his previous lifestyle, including eating a normal diet while still checking his breath alcohol levels sporadically,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe antibiotics the man took to treat his thumb injury may have triggered his case of ABS. The medication, cephalexin, \u201cresulted in a change in his gastrointestinal microbiome allowing fungal overgrowth,\" they wrote.\n\nDAD'S SKIN CANCER BATTLE LEAVES HIM WITH MASSIVE CHUNK MISSING FROM NECK, BACK\n\n\"For years, no one believed him,\" Dr. Fahad Malik, one of the report's authors and a chief medical resident at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told New Scientist. \"The police, doctors, nurses and even his family told him he wasn't telling the truth, that he must be a closet-drinker.\"\n\nThe news comes after doctors in September detailed a Chinese man\u2019s ABS case. The amount of alcohol-producing bacteria in his gut potentially led him to develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which had \"severely\" damaged his liver.", "description": "A 46-year-old man developed the rare, but very real condition known as auto-brewery syndrome (ABS), colloquially referred to as \u201cdrunkenness disease,\" after finishing a round of antibiotics, according to a recent report.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Dr. Fahad Malik", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
