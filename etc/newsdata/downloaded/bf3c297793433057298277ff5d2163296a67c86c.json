It\u2019s rated among our best credit cards for 2019.\n\nThings to know about credit cards:\n\nLong introductory period APR rates are only a short-term incentive. Potentially high APR rates snap into effect after the card\u2019s intro period ends, which could cost you a lot in interest if you\u2019ve left your balance unpaid. It\u2019s really important\u2014especially when getting a card for a big purchase\u2014to keep an eye on your finances, and keep an eye on the calendar.\n\nAPR rates and credit limits vary based on your individual credit. Credit limits and interest rates for each card are determined based on each cardholder's personal situation, so we did not take that information into account when evaluating these cards. Remember to pay your card off in full every month, so you will not be charged interest.\n\nBanks have final say on who they accept for a credit card. These recommendations were put together with the assumption that applicants would have average credit or above. That being said, banks decide who they will issue credit cards to using criteria including, but not always limited to, an individual's credit score when evaluating each applicants.\n\nSo is the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards worth it?\n\nUltimately, whether this card is right for you depends on your priorities as a spender and saver. Look elsewhere if you want a complex (though potentially more rewarding) system of points, shifting rewards categories, and other gambits. But if you want a consistent, no-annual fee card with a solid cash back plan and reasonable travel perks, the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards is a great pick.\n\nWhen you sign up for one of these cards, Reviewed may receive an affiliate commission from The Points Guy Affiliate Network.\n\nPlease note: the offers mentioned above are subject to change at any time and some may no longer be available.\n\nOther Top Credit Card Options\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
