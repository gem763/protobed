REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo\n\nThe departure of Romero Deschamps could allow President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to take a firmer grip of the future of national oil company Pemex, the world\u2019s most indebted.\n\nLopez Obrador this week said Romero Deschamps was under investigation, and on Wednesday revealed the union boss could face prosecution over two complaints filed against him.\n\nIn a statement, Romero Deschamps defended his record as union boss, pointing to positive changes for workers that include improvements in pensions and healthcare as well as salary increases.\n\nBut Romero Deschamps said he was resigning and that there was no longer \u201cthe cooperation that must exist between workers and administration to promote projects that allow Pemex\u2019s true progress towards consolidation.\u201d\n\nRomero Deschamps was a federal lawmaker with the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled Mexico for most of the past century, five times. He served three times in Mexico\u2019s lower house of Congress, and twice in the Senate. The posts gave him immunity from prosecution.\n\nAfter assuming leadership of the oil workers union in 1993, he wielded considerable power, keenly aware that taxes levied on the giant company accounted for a large chunk of the federal government\u2019s annual budget.\n\nIn 2000, Romero Deschamps was accused of helping divert 1.5 billion pesos from Pemex accounts to the presidential campaign of the then PRI contender Francisco Labastida.\n\nWhile a government audit later revealed anomalies covering 2.3 billion pesos in the so-called Pemexgate scandal, Romero Deschamps himself escaped unscathed. Others were not so lucky and were punished and fined.\n\nNow Romero Deschamps and \u201cother people\u201d face two complaints for \u201cthe crime of (financial) operations with funds of illegal origin,\u201d according to information provided by the financial intelligence unit of Mexico\u2019s finance ministry.\n\nEarlier this year, sources said the attorney general\u2019s office had accused him and several relatives of illicit enrichment and money laundering.\n\nRomero Deschamps has previously denied all charges.\n\nPast media reports of the lavish lifestyle of him and his family, which included trips on private jets and the purchase of a yacht and luxury sports cars, despite his modest official salary, had stoked accusations of corruption.\n\nIn 2012, his daughter Paulina posted pictures of a trip to Europe on her Facebook page, including images taken in private jets and five-star hotels along with her British bulldog traveling companions.\n\nThe photos created a media storm in Mexico, and the Facebook page was taken down shortly afterwards.\n\nLopez Obrador on Tuesday suggested that the veteran union leader and politician might consider quitting to address the allegations.\n\nLopez Obrador, who was himself a PRI member until the late 1980s, won office by a landslide in 2018 after years of campaigning against corruption.\n\nThe veteran leftist has promised to boost the fortunes of Pemex, which has suffered more than a dozen years of declining oil output, at a time when the company\u2019s payroll continued to rise.\n\nFor decades Pemex has been dogged with accusations that it is a hotbed for graft and kickbacks. Most of Pemex\u2019s employees are members of the oil workers union.\n\nManuel Limon Hernandez, a close confidant of Romero Deschamps, was picked to succeed him, according to the media reports, which cited sources inside the union.\n\nLimon Hernandez, who served as the union\u2019s treasurer for over a decade up until last year, is also a federal congressman with the PRI representing the oil-rich state of Veracruz.", "description": "The longtime head of Mexico's powerful oil workers union, Carlos Romero Deschamps resigned on Wednesday, a day after the president hinted he should step down to face allegations of wrongdoing.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441735345&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G02O", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
