And then this franchise shows you how much worse things could get.\n\nThis was a game that many fans and pundits alike \u2013 yours truly included \u2013 saw as a possible win. A chance for an 0-2 struggling Redskins team with a highly-touted defense to get right against a struggling 1-1 Bears offense (26 points in their first two games) and an inept Mitch Trubisky at quarterback. After all, he came into the game having completed 42 of 72 passes for 348 yards, no touchdowns and one interception in his first two games.\n\nBy halftime, when Trubisky had completed 20 of 23 passes for 173 yards and three touchdowns and staked his team to a 28-0 lead, those expectations seemed a little off.\n\nInstead, it turned out to be another chapter in Redskins futility, this one their special \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d entry.\n\nGoing into the Monday night game, the Redskins\u2018 record in these contests was the stuff of legends \u2013 2-15 since 2008. Their last Monday night win came in 2014, when Colt McCoy, playing in place of an injured Robert Griffin III, led Washington to a 20-17 overtime upset victory over the favored Cowboys in Dallas.\n\nBut then you had the Chicago factor that offset Washington\u2019s Monday night track record of disaster. The Redskins had beaten the Bears in their last seven meetings and had a 13-2 record against Chicago since 1989.\n\nIt was lining up as a Redskins chance to right the ship \u2013 with the right opponent.\n\nThen they took the field.\n\nFive minutes into the game, Redskins quarterback Case Keenum\u2019s pass was picked off by former Washington safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix \u2013 Keenum\u2019s first interception of the season \u2013 and returned 37 yards for a Bears touchdown and a 7-0 lead.\n\nThere would be more Keenum interceptions \u2013 including another by Clinton-Dix \u2013 three interceptions in all, along with two fumbles and four sacks. The Bears, led by linebacker Khalil Mack, showed Josh Norman, who had another dismal performance, and his great Redskins defense what defense truly was.\n\nIf defensive coordinator Greg Manusky \u2013 who the organization spent all winter trying to replace, to no avail \u2013 was on the hot seat before Monday night\u2019s game, that seat has got to be white hot now after several weeks of his defenses looking lost while failing to stop offenses, both good and bad. Snyder made his way down from his personal box to downstairs at the 2:00 warning. It\u2019s hard to imagine Manusky surviving that walk, but after the game Gruden insisted no changes were imminent.\n\nIn fact, he claimed he saw some progress defensively.\n\n\u201cI felt like there was some effort there, some physicality,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nHe went on to say something like \u201cthere are still a couple of things in the red zone we\u2019ve got to get cleaned up\u201d and muttered something about getting in and out, who knows what.\n\nHere is what is clear \u2013 there isn\u2019t enough soap in a Dove factory to clean up what is wrong with this team.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
