But the picture of Trump\u2019s outreach to additional potential foreign partners, and the scope of involvement of top government officials in the effort, was quickly changing.\n\nImpeachment: the five conspiracy theories behind Trump's Ukraine dilemma Read more\n\nBarr and Pompeo \u2013 whose vast portfolios nominally run from administering criminal justice in the United States to securing international alliances and combating threats abroad \u2013 have separately tried to distance themselves from the avalanching revelation that Trump\u2019s conduct of the matters of state has apparently, in significant proportion, been devoted to the pursuit of the president\u2019s personal bugbears and ambitions.\n\nBarr was previously reported to be \u201csurprised and angry\u201d to find his name mentioned in a summary of a call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, while Pompeo, when asked what he knew about that phone call, replied that he had not seen a copy of the whistleblower document that flagged it: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the complaint,\u201d he told ABC News.\n\nIn fact, Pompeo reportedly took part in the call, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing a senior state department official. For his part, Barr flew to Italy and to London to ask for help in \u201cinvestigating\u201d the roots of the Russia investigation, the Washington Post reported. Trump also asked the Australian prime Scott Morrison for help, and Morrison agreed to assist, something first reported by the New York Times, and confirmed by the Australian government.\n\n\u201cIt should trouble all of us that the attorney general is flying overseas and spending his time focused on discrediting the origins of the Mueller probe instead of combating crime here in the US,\u201d tweeted the former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. \u201cHis personal involvement reinforces the view that he does Trump\u2019s bidding.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty clear that Barr is working feverishly [with] Trump to produce some kind of anti-Mueller report,\u201d tweeted the MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\nThe justice department defied that characterization, issuing a statement Monday describing Barr\u2019s work as business-as-usual to support the US attorney John Durham\u2019s ongoing investigation of the FBI\u2019s former investigation of Russian election tampering. The justice department opened the counter-investigation following Trump\u2019s repeated claims that his campaign, which had serial secret contacts with Russian operatives, had been unfairly targeted for scrutiny.\n\n\u201cAt attorney general Barr\u2019s request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the attorney general and Mr Durham to appropriate officials,\u201d the spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mike Pompeo reportedly took part in a phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine. Photograph: Darren Ornitz/Reuters\n\nForeign officials could have information useful to Durham because the investigation of Trump\u2019s campaign began with a tip to the FBI from an Australian diplomat that a Trump aide had drunkenly told him about a Russian offer of \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut it was very unusual for the attorney general, much less the president, to be personally involved at such lengths in an internal investigation, even where foreign contacts are required, former federal prosecutors said.\n\n\u201cIn a real investigation, all that is needed is a request from a line prosecutor to the foreign country, made through the [justice department] Office of International Affairs, and pursuant to the terms of a mutual legal assistance treaty,\u201d tweeted Harry Sandick, a former prosecutor in the southern district of New York. \u201cNo calls from the president are involved.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s exertions to rewrite the history of the 2016 election and win re-election next year are the focus on an impeachment inquiry, which he appears to want to beat by exploiting the powers of his office to tar his political opponents as corrupt.\n\nAfter the impeachment inquiry was announced last week, the Trump administration intensified an investigation of communications between career public servants and Clinton, who found scandal by setting up a private server to host her correspondence as secretary of state.\n\nPompeo oversees the internal state department investigation \u2013 but has refused questions about it.\n\n\u201cI tried to ask [Pompeo] today why he is targeting veteran diplomats for routine emails when they had nothing to do with that private server,\u201d the NBC News anchor Andrea Mitchell tweeted Monday. \u201cHe turned his back and walked away.\u201d\n\nImpeachment: the five conspiracy theories behind Trump's Ukraine dilemma Read more\n\nWhen a summary appeared last week of the July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, the scope of involvement by the Trump administration seemed at first to be limited. Trump had mostly used his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to pursue his project, it seemed.\n\nBut that picture has quickly changed. The release of a whistleblower report Thursday suggested an active role by Barr, and said that a dozen US officials had listened to the Trump-Ukraine phone call, and that summaries of the call had been distributed more widely \u2013 raising the question of what proportion of Trump administration energies in recent months have been devoted to Trump\u2019s pet projects.\n\n\u201cThe America First crowd is jeopardizing our national security,\u201d tweeted Barack Obama\u2019s former speechwriter Jon Favreau, \u201cby pressuring foreign governments to help them discredit our intelligence officials and rig our elections.\u201d", "description": "Attorney general and secretary of state both reportedly took part in contacts between Trump and foreign leaders", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52f5467cd18954f8ce72f3e95b5eb1f2c2ecc935/0_68_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8fd0979894afea6260bb9d381a6b5a19", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
