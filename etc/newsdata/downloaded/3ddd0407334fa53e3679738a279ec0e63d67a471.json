I hope to learn how they react to questions, how they face questions they do not know in advance,\u201d said Mohamed Mazhoud, 31, a software developer.\n\nHe had come to the cafe with his brother Ali, 25, and three friends, planning to listen to each of the candidates scheduled for the first night of debate, with most of the other 18 appearing on Sunday or Monday.\n\nSaturday\u2019s batch included Abdelfattah Mourou, who is the first presidential candidate put forward by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, former prime minister Mehdi Jomaa and former president Moncef Marzouki.\n\nMourou was placed next to Abir Moussi, one of two women in the race and a supporter of the ousted autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, whose government banned Ennahda and jailed many of its members.\n\nAnother very prominent candidate, media magnate Nabil Karoui, is in detention on suspicion of tax fraud and money laundering, charges he denies and attributes to political chicanery. Debate organisers have said they will keep an empty podium place on the night he was scheduled to appear.\n\nThe furore surrounding his detention is not the only challenge facing Tunisian democracy during this election - years of economic troubles have also undermined trust in politics and turnout for municipal voting last year barely reached 30%.\n\nThe government has spent the past three years trying to push through tough spending cuts to curb the large level of public debt and to bolster security after Islamist militant attacks in 2015 that devastated the crucial tourism sector.\n\nUnemployment, at 12% before the revolution, now stands at 15% nationally and more than 30% in some cities.\n\n\u201cDEMOCRACY IS FOR THE RICH\u201d\n\nAround Tunis on Saturday evening, most cafe televisions seemed set to a football match between France and Albania, though politically engaged people may have chosen to watch at home where they could better hear the candidates.\n\nOutside the Cafe Les Palmiers, groups of men sat playing cards or smoking. At one table of four, Rida Ben Salem, 53, said he had lost any belief that the elections would change his difficult lot in life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the debate and I don\u2019t want to watch it,\u201d he said. He makes 400 Tunisian dinars ($140) a month selling prickly cactus fruit from a wooden barrow he pushes round the streets by hand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need this democracy. Democracy is for the rich, not for the poor like us,\u201d he added.\n\nStill, he said that with elections coming the police would lay off street vendors like him, only cracking down on them again after the polls.\n\nIt was the self-immolation of a street vendor whose barrow was confiscated by police that sparked the revolution.\n\nIn a downtown cafe where dozens of people were watching the debate on a large screen on the pavement, engineer Saidan Abdelsettar said he was definitely planning to vote, but had not yet chosen a candidate.\n\n\u201cUntil now I can\u2019t say one candidate stands out. But the debates help because it gives me an idea of how they present themselves,\u201d he said.", "description": "Eight presidential candidates stood behind their podiums aiming to impress Tunisian voters on Saturday evening in the young democracy's first ever televised election debate.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
