There\u2019s a hell of a lot of money on the line as well as the belt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m going to back Lima. I\u2019ve fought them both. Rory is a finisher and has these murderous calm fighting style, but I think Lima will bring it to him and he won\u2019t be able to scrap by this time. He\u2019ll get stopped.\u2019\n\nAfter a draw with Jon Fitch in April, MacDonald surprised everyone by saying he wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to \u2018hurt\u2019 people anymore. The honest admission led to speculation the former UFC star might retire early.\n\nMacDonald, however, did not hang up his gloves and continued in the grand prix, beating Neiman Gracie to book his place in the final against Lima. The winner of the tournament takes home the welterweight belt, as well as $1million (\u00a3776,980) in prize money.\n\nThe grand prix winner takes home the belt and $1m (Picture: Getty)\n\nDespite appearing to resolve his doubts, Daley believes it is the prospect of a massive pay day that is keeping MacDonald from retirement.\n\n\u2018Rory has looked lacklustre,\u2019 Daley explained. \u2018I know he\u2019s said he wants to go on in the sport, but I think he just wants to get as much as he can financially from the sport.\n\n\u2018His performances aren\u2019t the Rory of old. He\u2019s been in big fights and taken a lot of beatings even in victories. His body is feeling it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a matter doing it for the money. Lima has more to prove and wants to be recognised on the big stage, even if people think he\u2019s one of the best in the world anyway.\u2019\n\nWatch Paul Daley in action at Bellator 232 this Saturday night on Sky Sports Action from 2am.\n\nMORE: Conor McGregor announces UFC return in January and Nate Diaz trilogy fight in 2020\n\nMORE: Dan Hardy advises Conor McGregor to take Dustin Poirier fight and avoid Justin Gaethje", "description": "Douglas Lima will dethrone a distracted Rory MacDonald at Bellator 232, according to British MMA fighter Paul Daley.", "authors": ["Coral Barry"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-908138920_1572022613.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
