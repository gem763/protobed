This time he has even gone as far as to release documents that he believes back up his conduct in relation to his call with Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelensky. The memo about that call is now a major part of the impeachment investigation against Trump.\n\nAmerica\u2019s 45th president has the right to defend himself, but the media must be careful about how this is taken into account when addressing the issue at hand. The impeachment inquiry is a good example. From the texts presented to congress by Kurt Volker, the former US special representative for Ukraine negotiations, to the details of the call with Zelensky, some elements of the scandal are turning from opinion into fact.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe texts show that US officials had at least suggested to their Ukrainian counterparts that support from Washington may be dependent on Kiev\u2019s help with \u201cinvestigations\u201d. With Trump also calling on Zelensky to contact attorney general William Barr and the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani during their July phone conversation, it is obvious that he is turning the powers of the state towards helping him out.\n\nTrump may tweet that all he is interested in is weeding out corruption, but using the state resources to potentially seek help from a foreign power to investigate a political rival \u2013 Joe Biden \u2013 is against the rules. Trump may not pay a legal price if the House of Representatives votes for impeachment and a trial in the Senate, but Democrats want to make sure he pays a political one.\n\nThe president\u2019s narrative is that this is all a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him, and with it he is seeking to turn the investigation from deciding whether his conduct has passed the bar for wrongdoing, to whether it is wrong at all for a White House incumbent to seek help from a foreign country. All media should be wary of falling into that trap.\n\nWe are there to report on the facts of the inquiry as it carries on and its framing is clear. Changing the question is just what Trump wants. As always, he is trying to muddy the waters, tarring every politician with the same brush so his conduct looks ordinary. Trump may come out of this investigation with a clean slate, but it is the media\u2019s job to make sure the case is heard clearly.\n\nYours,\n\nChris Stevenson\n\nActing deputy premium editor", "description": "Donald Trump will always defend his actions one way: \u201cI have done nothing wrong.\u201d The president often won\u2019t dispute the allegations against him.
