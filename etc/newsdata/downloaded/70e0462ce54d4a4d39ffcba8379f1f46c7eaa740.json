Talking to CNBC this morning, the Senate Majority Leader again reminded the hosts that Senate rules require the upper chamber to start a trial if the House impeaches a federal officeholder, and that it would take 67 votes to change those rules. McConnell doesn\u2019t plan to challenge the rule, but he says that the trial might not last too long if and when one starts:\n\nThe Senate would have to take up impeachment of President Donald Trump if the House effectively votes to charge the president, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday. \u201cI would have no choice but to take it up,\u201d the Kentucky Republican told CNBC. \u201cHow long you are on it is a different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment.\u201d \u2026 If the House impeaches, the Republican-held Senate would then hold a trial on whether to convict Trump and remove him from office. Despite the current lack of support for the inquiry among Senate Republicans, McConnell said the chamber by rule would have no choice but to follow through with the process.\n\n\u201cHow long you are on it is a different matter,\u201d McConnell says as an aside, which the CNBC panel doesn\u2019t notice. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju did, however, and he speculates that McConnell would simply move to dismiss after following the letter of the rules in starting the trial:\n\nMcConnell added that it would require 67 votes to change Senate rules to prevent a trial from taking place \u2013 so the rule change won\u2019t happen. But he can move to dismiss after the trial begins. \u201cHow long I\u2019m on it is another matter,\u201d he said of a trial \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 30, 2019\n\nThe most recent version of the Senate rules on impeachment indeed require that a trial commence; it does not even provide for a vote on the subject. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court then becomes the presiding officer and rules on all motions presented at the trial, unless a member of the Senate moves to hold a vote on it or the presiding officer asks for the Senate to resolve it themselves. Under Rule VII, that becomes a non-debatable motion on the floor with an immediate final vote:\n\nPresumably, a motion to dismiss would be in order at any point once the trial began. If Chief Justice John Roberts ruled against it or ruled it out of order, Rule VII allows any member of the Senate to call for a vote on the motion, which Roberts must grant. At that point, the normal rules of the Senate come into play \u2014 except that there can be no debate before the vote. Without debate, there is no filibuster or cloture, which means a dismissal motion would rise or fall on a simple majority.\n\nIf Republicans move to dismiss, they could incur some political risk in shutting down a trial before it plays all the way out. By that time, everyone will see what the House puts into the articles of impeachment and can judge whether it rises to the level of removal, and so far Ukraine-Gate seems to fall far short of that mark. Short-circuiting a trial could erode the credibility of the final vote, which is almost certain to be an acquittal on a party-line vote, but McConnell might still get one or two Senate Democrats willing to say Trump\u2019s bad but that impeachment and removal was unwarranted. A dismissal would probably preclude that possibility and open up charges that Republicans cooked the process to protect Trump \u2014 even though a dismissal motion is a legitimate procedure in a trial. That\u2019s no small consideration just months before Senate Republicans head into an election cycle where they have to defend a lot more seats than Democrats do.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s an option in McConnell\u2019s pocket, and his offhand remark here suggests he\u2019s taking that option seriously. If anyone can play it for political benefit, it\u2019s Cocaine Mitch.", "description": "\u201cHow long you are on it is a different matter.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mcconnell-cnbc.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
