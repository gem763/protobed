I\u2019m not gonna play that game.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed a report that he was among those who listened in on Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky.\n\nBlinken said it would not be unusual for Pompeo to listen in.\n\n\u201cThe issue, though, is not, to me at least, necessarily his presence on the call,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cIt\u2019s hearing the president try to shake down the Ukrainians for discrediting political dirt on his leading political adversary. Why didn\u2019t he say anything? Maybe he did. We just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "In a new episode of \u201cSkullduggery,\u201d Tony Blinken says the president\u2019s request for foreign leaders to investigate the former vice president and his son \u201cfundamentally undermines our institutions of government.\u201d", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1GjOhSmFsV7Fj4VazBYDMA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/57f248d0-e602-11e9-b5cd-ad7c2e6a8124", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
