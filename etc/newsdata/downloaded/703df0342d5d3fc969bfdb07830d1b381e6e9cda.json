As one indication, Whistleblower Wednesday brought sky-high cable ratings \u2014 including on Fox, where Trump defenders were working tirelessly in prime time but where news coverage couldn\u2019t fully avoid, or spin, the obvious.\n\nRelated slideshow: Donald Trump's life in pictures\n\nAnd even those who weren\u2019t all that interested could hardly avoid it.\n\nIt was thrust before their eyes, including on the three networks\u2019 evening news shows, which all led their 30-minute broadcasts with substantial segments \u2014 not one of which could have made Trump happy. (Those three half hours are still appointment viewing for more than 20 million people each night, on average.)\n\nEven in this digital age, most Americans still get their news on the tube, according to a 2018 Pew Research study \u2014 though that of course is shifting fast to digital sources, especially smartphones.\n\nIn fact, it may be the combination of the incessant online blasts and the negative television imagery that is proving so hard for Trump to control.\n\n\u201cBrace Yourself for the Internet Impeachment,\u201d was the headline of a Thursday New York Times article.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event,\u201d wrote Kevin Roose. \u2018The political stakes are high, the dramatic story unspools tidbit by tidbit and the stark us-versus-them dynamics provide plenty of fodder for emotionally charged social media brawls.\u201d\n\nFrustrated and angry, Trump has ramped up his customary attacks on journalists \u2014 and has acknowledged, with an edge of bitter self-pity, that things have dramatically changed.\n\n\u201cI used to be the king of good press,\u201d he lamented at the U.N. news conference. \u201cThey covered me well \u2014 otherwise, I probably wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nHe now favors a new adjective of disparagement.\n\n\u201cMuch of the press \u2026 is not only fake, it\u2019s corrupt,\u201d he said at the same event.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has abandoned \u2014 perhaps foolishly \u2014 a traditional way it used to get its message out (and allow itself to be held accountable): the daily press briefing.\n\nIt has now been 200 days without one. The new White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, has yet to answer questions from behind the lectern \u2014 preferring, apparently, to condemn reporters in writing, whether by tweet or by op-ed in the friendly spaces of the conservative Washington Examiner.\n\nIt\u2019s about to get worse: Impeachment hearings are sure to flood the media zone with images and words that cannot make the president look good, despite the best efforts of his loyal defenders.\n\nIn the new film, \u201cWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn?\u201d the disgraced lawyer to the mob \u2014 and to celebrities, including Trump \u2014 is heard speculating in an interview on how he\u2019ll be remembered. Cohn confidently predicts that his obituary will emphasize his role as aide to the red-baiting Wisconsin senator, Joseph McCarthy.\n\nHis voice then is spookily followed by a photograph of his New York Times obituary. He called it: \u201cRoy Cohn, Aide to McCarthy and Fiery Lawyer, Dies at 59.\u201d\n\nThe moment of truth for McCarthy and Cohn came in televised hearings when a lawyer for the U.S. Army shut down the senator with his damning accusation: \u201cHave you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\u201d\n\nTelevision made all the difference in 1954, as it did again almost two decades later during the televised Watergate hearings, with their disastrous effect on Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency.\n\nGranted, the media world looks nothing like it did in the 1950s or the 1970s.\n\nBut then again \u2014 for the president \u2014 it also looks nothing like it did two weeks ago.\n\nmargaret.sullivan@washpost.com", "description": "Accustomed to manipulating the news, he\u2019s watching now \u2014 and so is America", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHVIap.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1153&y=337"}
