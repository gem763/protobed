Yet, litter is still dumped on the streets, leaving residents to navigate water-filled potholes and emergency services to rescue people trapped in their flooded homes or stranded \u2013 there have been over 30 declared fatalities so far.\n\nIn a move which surprised many, prime minister Narendra Modi \u2013 who recently reaffirmed his country\u2019s commitment to the Paris Agreement \u2013 last week side-stepped a widely anticipated ban on single-use plastic throughout India, instead pledging his commitment to \u201craising awareness\u201d of the issue, in line with plans to eliminate single-use plastic entirely by 2022.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nCritics of a nationwide ban cite a law passed in March 2018, by the state government of Maharashtra \u2013 of which Mumbai, with its population of 22.5 million, is the capital \u2013 that banned the sale, use and distribution of plastic bags, polystyrene, single-use plastic cutlery and pouches, PET bottles with a liquid capacity smaller than half a litre and non-woven polypropylene bags.\n\nOver 18 months later, there are cries that Mumbai is no closer to success \u2013 with a large number of its businesses blaming a lack of alternatives, disruption to supply chains and rising production costs \u2013 leading many to question whether the government\u2019s environmental efforts are anything more than a PR exercise. However, despite a lack of support from above, grassroots organisations in the city are building momentum and leading the way in the promotion of sustainable practices \u2013 a lesson for the rest of the country that, under no uncertain terms, change is possible.\n\nFollowing a call-to-action made during his annual Independence Day address on 15 August, Modi was widely expected to ban single-use plastic by 2 October, the 150th anniversary of Gandhi\u2019s birth. However, after loud resistance from the country\u2019s plastic corporations \u2013 which employ nearly 4 million people across 30,000 processing units \u2013 an \u201cawareness campaign\u201d was announced in place of a blanket ban.\n\nThe much-hyped \u201cClean India\u201d mission \u2013 which, in line with Gandhi\u2019s vision for the country, requires all businesses and individuals to dedicate 100 hours per year to India\u2019s sanitisation as of October 2014 \u2013 tweeted \u201cit is not about banning single-use plastic but creating awareness and a people\u2019s movement to curb its use\u201d. The news also comes after figures, released in June 2019 by the National Sample Survey Office, showed an overall unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent; the highest in 45 years.\n\nIn March 2018, the Maharashtrian government issued a three-month warning before putting its ban on single-use plastic in place throughout the state, applicable to businesses and consumers alike. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) deployed around 300 blue-uniformed guards to carry out spot checks on businesses and slap fines on business owners for failing to comply with the law \u2013 anywhere from 5,000 rupees (\u00a355) for a first-time offence, to 25,000 INR (\u00a3274), plus a three-month prison sentence as a maximum penalty.\n\nA year later, just half of the BMC patrol are said to remain on active duty. Civic efforts are running out of steam, due, in part, to a lack of space for collected waste and a perceived disinterest in recycling contracts. When questioned, corporations lobby against such regulations and blame a lack of hygienic alternatives offered \u2013 particularly those that would cover the cost of liability for transmitting foodborne illnesses \u2013 feeling ill-equipped to fully relinquish the use of single-use plastic in their day-to-day operations.\n\nBut the issue runs deeper: according to a report by the British Plastics Federation, the growth rate of the Indian plastics industry is one of the highest in the world \u2013 growing at 16 per cent per annum, compared to 10 per cent in China. Despite India\u2019s population of 1.37 billion (versus China\u2019s 1.39 billion), its plastics industry regularly reports shortages in labour, thus it invests heavily in Indian technology, such as automation and conveyor belt systems.\n\nWith Mumbai now a hotbed for \u201cecopreneurs\u201d, single-use plastic alternatives \u2013 such as Beco, a technology startup selling biodegradable alternatives to kitchen-based plastic packaging, which has already been able to prevent over 130 tons of waste since the company\u2019s inception in March \u2013 are indeed available, but lack corporate and governmental support persists.\n\nOne of the first things we are asked is, \u2018Who do you work with already? What\u2019s in this for us?\u2019, which just makes you understand that this is an ingrained mindset and a lot of businesses are reluctant to be the ones seen to be leading change\n\nA growing shift in consciousness is being led by local students and environmentalists, heralding the rise of grassroots schemes that challenge antiquated social conventions, such as caste-focused hierarchies, and tackle the bureaucracy that\u2019s hindering much-needed environmental change. Many of these grassroots groups focus on collecting plastic waste throughout the city, leading the charge in transforming each of Mumbai\u2019s districts and eco-systems.\n\nOne example is Mumbai\u2019s \u201cBeach Warriors\u201d, a group which mobilises to collect plastic waste each weekend and, having succeeded in bringing locals together to transform its plastic-ridden beaches, has recently dispatched a team to the ghats (riverside steps) in Kolkata. The non-profit organisation \u201cProject Mumbai\u201d \u2013 led by lawyer and environmentalist Afroz Shah \u2013 mobilised nearly 5,000 Mumbaikars to clean up almost 20 tons of litter from nine beachfronts, four rivers and various mangroves, a feat which was later recognised by the United Nations as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest beach cleanup project\u201d. Shah has since been praised for a second accomplishment: successfully unifying people of all castes and religions \u2013 everyone from residents of the Dharavi slums to Bollywood actors \u2013 to engage with a cause that impacts all Indians, regardless of their background or circumstance.\n\nElsewhere, the sustainability movement is changing how the fashion industry works. In India, the industry will be worth $59.3bn by 2022 \u2013 comparable to the UK\u2019s $65bn \u2013 making it the sixth-largest in the world. Mumbai\u2019s up-and-coming designers are determined to make sustainability fashionable, and to teach consumers about the supply chain, highlighting India\u2019s longstanding history of craftsmanship to a younger, more socially-conscious audience, who are increasingly inclined to reject the waste being created by \u201cfast fashion\u201d outlets.\n\nThere\u2019s Toile, an eco-friendly boutique in the city\u2019s Khar West district, run by Farheen Rahman and Priti Jain, which is known for donating to charity with every purchase and for championing home-grown eco-labels. Doodlage, an entirely zero-waste brand, donates excess fabrics to various NGOs, such as the welfare-focused Samarpan Foundation, to create reusable sanitary products for women in rural areas.\n\nKaSha, by Karishma Shahani \u2013 a graduate from the London College of Fashion \u2013 creates jackets from plastic bags, jewellery from chandeliers and weaves entirely new fabrics from onion sacks. Apurva Kothari, a young Mumbaikar, designs organic, non-GMO cotton clothing under her e-commerce label No Nasties, which benefits farmers in Maharashtra and nearby state Andhra Pradesh. Bhumika and Jyoti \u2013 located in Mumbai\u2019s trendy Juhu neighbourhood, mere steps from Soho House\u2019s first outpost in Asia \u2013 was conceived by a former Bollywood actress, who leveraged her star power to create India\u2019s first zero-waste concept store.\n\n4 million The number of people employed in India\u2019s plastics industry\n\nAlso changing is Mumbai\u2019s hospitality industry. The global market has woken up to the fact that its guests want their experience to be environmentally friendly \u2013 with the world\u2019s largest hotel operator, Marriott International, announcing that it is to ban plastic amenities in its properties by the end of 2020. A study by tourism operator Cox and Kings India, which surveyed 5,000 millennials (aged 20-35) in key cities found that 89 per cent would choose a hotel based on its sustainable practices. Furthermore, 92 per cent of those surveyed also showed an interest in \u201caltruistic travel\u201d: cause-based trips, NGO visits, sustainable treks, hikes and rural tours.\n\nErin Zaikis is founder of the India-centric NGO Sundara Fund, which recycles used hotel soap \u2013 melting down the product and sanitising it to create new bars. Sundara currently hires almost 40 local women full-time. She pays them a fair living wage and empowers them to conduct free hygiene classes for other vulnerable communities and distribute what they have made. Zaikis attributes the challenges the Indian hospitality industry faces to an almost insurmountable level of bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cWhen Sundara gets soap from a partner, we\u2019re asked to sign a liability contract and take out insurance, so if it ever came down to it, we\u2019d be the ones being sued,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the first things we are asked is, \u2018Who do you work with already? What\u2019s in this for us?\u2019, which just makes you understand that this is an ingrained mindset and a lot of businesses are reluctant to be the ones seen to be leading change.\u201d\n\nOne of the hotels which have been fearless about exacting change, however, is boutique hotel Abode Bombay \u2013 one of Sundara\u2019s first partners in India \u2013 which signed up to the project without hesitation. Co-founder Abedin Sham created a concept of \u201cnothing new, everything local\u201d, which extends to everything in the hotel, from carefully repurposed furniture to fabrics and artworks sourced from Mumbai\u2019s vintage markets.\n\nThe homely property, located in downtown Mumbai, is passionate about social enterprise. It works with a female-owned and operated taxi company, which helps survivors of child marriage, alcohol abuse and domestic violence into employment, and, in a rare move for the hierarchical Indian hospitality industry, places its staff firmly on the same social strata as their guests by putting them on first-name terms. It has also completely eschewed single-use plastic which, with shabby chic chandeliers and sari-covered cushions, would look equally at home in Shoreditch. In line with the \u201cClean India\u201d policy, Abode Bombay and other hotels in the area each conduct cleanup initiatives around Colaba, Mumbai\u2019s main tourist district.\n\n\u201cBy making people lead change in each region, others will follow, and sometimes we find that our guests want to join us and help,\u201d says Sham. \u201cWe end up collecting around three tons of dry litter per outing, with the help of our guests, friends and family.\u201d The growing wave of environmental consciousness is filtering up to the country\u2019s titans of hospitality. The five-star IHCL Group \u2013 which operates the landmark Taj Mahal Palace in downtown Mumbai \u2013 pledged to minimise its carbon footprint by maximising renewable energy and, at key properties, has invested in bottling plants in order to phase out PET bottles, which are still being manufactured at an alarming rate across India. The group recently opened beach resort Taj Exotica Resort and Spa in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, off the east coast of the country, which is entirely free of single-use plastic.\n\nThe tide has changed with India\u2019s younger generation, who recognise environmental apathy as an impending threat to their health, business and biodiversity, but can also readily identify the need for a collective Indian identity in order to impact change on a macro level \u2013 and change appears to becoming, as a result of their sustained efforts. Leading conglomerate GVK, which owns some of the country\u2019s biggest energy, hospitality and transportation businesses, has announced that as of 2 October Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport is now 100 per cent free of any single-use plastic, with all food and drink and retail outlets having tackled any residual use.\n\nParticularly with the current absence of rigid national law, which perhaps suggests the government\u2019s growing recognition of the gulf between corporate and consumer interest, the time is ripe for Indians to collectively create room for global innovation in the fight against plastic pollution. Entrepreneurs need only to look to the new generation in Mumbai to see that environmental polluters will increasingly find their businesses under threat if they don\u2019t clean up their act.", "description": "This year\u2019s monsoon in Mumbai saw the highest rainfall in history, breaking the\u00a0previous record of 3,452mm\u00a0in 1954.", "authors": ["Shivani Ashoka"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/11/mumbai-monsoon-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
