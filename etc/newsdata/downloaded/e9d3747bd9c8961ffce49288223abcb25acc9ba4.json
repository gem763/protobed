Other candidates, many of whom are courting moderate Democrats and risk failing to qualify for the November debate, made it an uncomfortable evening for Warren \u2014 but they failed to knock her off stride.\n\nFor his part, Biden skimmed through the debate and maintained his focus on attacking President Donald Trump on domestic policy, foreign relations and presidential leadership. He faced no criticism from any rivals for his son Hunter\u2019s work on the board of a foreign company in Ukraine while he was vice president, an issue that sits at the center of a House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden deflected an early question about his son\u2019s arrangement, insisting that neither of them did anything wrong and the fault was solely with Trump for asking Ukraine to investigate his family. He never had to address the issue again in the three-hour debate.\n\nDemocratic strategist Adam Jentleson said the Democrats who went negative on the Massachusetts senator were \u201cbroadcasting that they think Warren is the one to beat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s big backlash risk to them because Warren is extremely well-liked,\u201d Jentleson said. \u201cShe was cool under pressure and turned the attacks into made-for-TV clap-backs.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg questioned Warren\u2019s honesty when she declined to give a yes or no answer on whether her health care plan will raise taxes on the middle class.\n\n\u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2014 except this,\u201d he told her at the CNN-New York Times debate in Westerville, Ohio. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to get affordable coverage for everybody is to obliterate private plans.\u201d\n\nWarren \u2014 who has adopted Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan to put all Americans in an expanded Medicare program \u2014 diverted the issue to overall health care costs, promising to only sign into a law a bill that that lowers expenses for middle-class families.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough for Amy Klobuchar.\n\n\u201dAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d she said after Sanders declared that taxes would go up to cover the $30 trillion cost of Medicare for All. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, you have not said that.\u201d\n\nIt was a marked change on the debate stage for Biden, who had been the clear front-runner since the start of the nomination contest and generally took the most attacks from his Democratic rivals. It\u2019s not clear the offensive will help the Democrats break out of the pack, with all but Warren, Biden and Sanders polling in single digits.\n\nIn earlier debates, going negative has often hurt candidates with party voters, many of whom are desperate to defeat Trump and worry that an ugly primary will leave their nominee bloodied before the general election.\n\nKamala Harris went after Warren for refusing to join her demand that Twitter suspend Trump\u2019s account for allegedly inciting violence, and repeatedly challenged Warren to back her proposal.\n\nWarren didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI don\u2019t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to push him out of the White House.\u201d\n\nLater, Beto O\u2019Rourke said that sometimes \u201cSenator Warren is more focused on being punitive\u201d while discussing her plan to tax wealth above $50 million. He said the goal should instead be \u201clifting people up.\u201d\n\nWarren brushed it off, saying she\u2019s \u201creally shocked than anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive,\u201d and adding that she doesn\u2019t \u201chave a beef with billionaires\u201d but rather believes they should pay higher taxes.\n\nTulsi Gabbard joined in, challenging Warren to support her calls for ending wars. Warren responded that she\u2019d prefer to \u201cget out of the Middle East\u201d but that \u201cwe have to do it the right way, the smart way.\u201d\n\nThe attacks on Warren had an upside for her, ensuring that she had the most speaking time of anyone on stage, according to a tracker by the New York Times. The rules of the debate stated that a candidate who\u2019s referenced by a rival is allowed to respond.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Democratic presidential candidates treated Elizabeth Warren like a front-runner in the fourth debate Tuesday, ripping into the progressive contender on her sincerity and poking holes in her signature policy plans to provide health care for all and tax the rich.The race is rapidly becoming", "authors": ["Sahil Kapur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T7JugWPXgPhPaa34T69nmg--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/9543701af94e9dbbcd5d559d5821125d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
