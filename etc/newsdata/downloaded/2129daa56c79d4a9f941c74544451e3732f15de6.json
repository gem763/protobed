Deliberations took approximately 90 minutes before a unanimous sentencing was arrived at.\n\nConvicted murderers are sentenced by a jury in Texas, and the crime carries a sentence of five to 99 years in prison.\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp allowed the jury to consider a potential verdict \u201cunder the immediate influence of sudden passion,\u201d which would have reduced the range to two to 20 years, but the jury unanimously rejected the caveat.\n\nIn its closing statement, the prosecution asked jurors to consider a minimum of 28 years for Guyger. Jean would have turned 28 this coming Sunday. Attorneys also attempted to shed doubt on Guyger\u2019s character by bringing up past texts and social media posts which showed racist and violent tendencies from the former Dallas police officer.\n\nThe defense maintained its tragic mistake argument throughout the sentencing proceedings, asking the female-majority jury to not compound the loss of Jean\u2019s life with a life behind bars for Guyger.\n\nAlmost immediately after the sentencing, protests began outside the courtroom, as angry chants of \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d broke out, and supporters of the Jean family gave their reactions to reporters.\n\nIn a powerful moment during witness impact statements following the sentencing, Jean\u2019s younger brother Brandt Jean forgave Guyger and embraced her in the courtroom.\n\nWOW moment I\u2019ve never seen in a murder trial. #BothamJean brother asks to hug #AmberGuyger after talking about God\u2019s forgiveness. \u201cGive your life to Christ,\u201d he told her.\n\nThey embrace for a long time. pic.twitter.com/aeRiWkl8x7 \u2014 Cynthia Izaguirre (@wfaaizzy) October 2, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp also took a moment to offer her condolences to Jean\u2019s parents and family, and spoke directly to Guyger before giving her a Bible.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "The jury in the Botham Jean murder trial sentenced Amber Guyger on Wednesday to ten years in prison for the murder of Botham Jean.
