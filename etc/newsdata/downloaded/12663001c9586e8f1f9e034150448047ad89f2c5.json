If all goes according to plan, you\u2019ll remember the name a lot better in the near future when it starts bringing its foldable phones to market, including this ambitious tri-fold model that it\u2019s still working on.\n\nCNET\u2019s Jessica Dolcourt got a chance to check out a prototype of TCL\u2019s latest venture, which features two of the company\u2019s DragonHinges to morph into a 10-inch tablet when unfolded: One folds in, and the other folds out.\n\nWith two hinges, the device will naturally be pretty thick, but at least it\u2019ll feel like a normal phone with a usable tall screen on the front, and a quad camera array on the rear. And as Dolcourt noted, the tri-fold design could allow for using one portion of the screen as a keyboard, while the other two portions could serve as a large display. That leads me to believe there might be something to this foldable madness after all.\n\nCredit: CNET TCL\u2019s tri-fold phone has one portion of its screen fold in, and the other fold out\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s too early to tell. The prototype that Dolcourt handled wasn\u2019t a working model, and we have no idea about the device\u2019s specs, pricing or launch date. The company has previously shown off other foldable concepts, including one with a single hinge and a working flexible OLED display \u2014 so hopefully it will actually be able to bring these to life.\n\nFor now, you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on Samsung\u2019s $1,980 Galaxy Fold, which is now available in stores across South Korea, and Huawei\u2019s CNY 16,999 ($2,400) Mate X, which will begin shipping in China on November 15.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "CNET got a chance to check out a prototype of TCL's latest venture, which features two of the company's DragonHinges to morph into a 10-inch tablet.", "authors": ["Abhimanyu Ghoshal", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Fold-foldable-phone-hed.jpg&signature=2cc04211fcb4fee0510a6e55c7dbb7d8", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
