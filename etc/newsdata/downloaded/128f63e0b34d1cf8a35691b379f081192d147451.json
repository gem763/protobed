I have to say something?\u201d Fognini replied, asked by AFP what he made of Murray\u2019s accusations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to defend myself. The past is the past, I have known him since we are 14.\n\n\u201cFor me they stay on court, and that\u2019s it\u2026 I\u2019ve nothing to say.\u201d\n\nPushed if was aggrieved to have been told to \u201cshut up\u201d by a fuming Murray, Fognini said: \u201cI don\u2019t (wasn\u2019t) upset, I\u2019m not.\n\n\u201cHe has his character, I have mine, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nFognini, who defeated Russia\u2019s Karen Khachanov to reach the last eight in Shanghai on Thursday, queried the need to make peace with three-time Grand Slam champion Murray.\n\n\u201cPeace? I told you, we know each other really well,\u201d said Fognini.\n\n\u201cInside the court we are almost the same because most of the time I\u2019m complaining and he\u2019s complaining.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s part of our job, so I\u2019ve nothing to say.\u201d\n\nReports suggested that Fognini and Murray, who clashed at the net towards the end of their tetchy match, followed the row on afterwards.\n\n\u201cWe talked normally,\u201d said the Italian.\n\nFognini put on another colourful display to reach the Shanghai quarter-finals.\n\nThe Italian had several prickly exchanges with the chair umpire and the crowd in a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Khachanov.\n\nFognini collapsed in fits of laughter at the net after one umpiring decision and then had an animated exchange with the official in Italian.\n\nHe next plays Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev, the in-form world number four and US Open finalist.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the worst player that I can play at the moment because he changed completely in the summer,\u201d Fognini said.\n\n\u201cOf course he was great also before, but he made unbelievable changes during the US swing and he\u2019s dangerous, he\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 Fabio Fognini said on Thursday that Andy Murray and himself are alike because they both like to complain, after their match at the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/f09a31_bad-blood-boiled-on-tuesday-fognini-defeated-murray-in-bitter-sets-briton-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
