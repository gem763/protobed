He prescribed so many narcotic pills he became known by drug users as \"the Candy Man,\" authorities said.\n\nThe medical professionals helped fuel the state's opioid epidemic, prosecutors said.\n\nSpayd distributed more than 4 million doses of opioid narcotics to 450 patients between 2014 and 2019, authorities said.\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration took notice of Spayd because of signals including patients traveling long distances, prescriptions written before previous prescriptions expired, and patients using multiple names and pharmacies, according to a criminal affidavit.\n\nAt least 19 of Spayd's patients \"died within one month of filling an opioid prescription\" issued by her. Twelve died within two weeks and five died the same day or the next day, the affidavit said.\n\nDavidhizar prescribed more than 700,000 narcotic pills between 2017 and 2019, and \"was well known in the drug abuser community on the Kenai Peninsula,\" a criminal affidavit said.\n\nUndercover Federal Bureau of Investigation agents posed as patients with signs of opioid addiction but \"little pain justifying the opioids they sought,\" according to the affidavit, which said Davidhizar still prescribed opioids to them.\n\nSpayd faces a minimum of 20 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charges, while Davidhizar faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Anchorage Daily News, http://www.adn.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
