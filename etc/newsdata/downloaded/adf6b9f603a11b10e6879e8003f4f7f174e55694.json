Senate Republican leaders have repeatedly said they are waiting for President Trump to clearly articulate and lobby for specific gun policy changes before committing to bringing a bill to the chamber\u2019s floor.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), a member of leadership, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that any legislation needs the president\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cThe president needs to step up here and set some guidelines for what he would do,\u201d Mr. Blunt said.\n\nThe administration has at times sent mixed signals over other policy positions to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, or quickly reversed its position. A Republican effort to pass an immigration bill last year that met the administration\u2019s standards while also winning support from moderates collapsed without vigorous support from the president. A tweet he sent the morning of the vote endorsing the bill did little to salvage it.\n\nMore recently, Mr. Trump\u2019s support for a two-year budget agreement that also raised the U.S. government\u2019s borrowing limit did not translate into widespread GOP support. Unlike some other legislative battles, Mr. Trump and the administration took a more conventional lobbying approach for the bill, calling undecided lawmakers and repeatedly advocating for it in public. Many Republicans defected, however, with 23 Republicans opposing it the Senate and 132 Republicans voting against it in the House.\n\nEven if the White House does commit to specific gun-control provisions, then, Republicans may or may not go along with it.\n\nRelated Video Following three recent major mass shootings, Congress will return amid an outcry for tighter gun controls.
