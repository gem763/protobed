I spend 99% of my life travelling the world by commercial,\" he said.\n\n\"Occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe - it's generally as simple as that.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"While no one is perfect we all have a responsibility for our own individual impact\"\n\nDuring his opening speech, the duke said \"no one is perfect\" in terms of his impact on the environment.\n\nQuestions have been asked about the royal couple's use of private jets and their impact following their support of environmental causes.\n\nPrince Harry has previously spoken about the importance of tackling climate change.\n\nIn September's edition of Vogue - edited by Meghan - the prince spoke about environmental issues and his love for nature, saying: \"We are the one species on this planet that seems to think that this place belongs to us, and only us.\"\n\nThe Sussexes came under fire over the summer after taking a private flight to the home of singer Sir Elton John, in Nice.\n\nSir Elton defended the royal couple, saying he provided them with his private plane to \"maintain a high level of much-needed protection\".\n\nHe also said he paid to carbon offset their trip to his French home.\n\nImage copyright Press Association Image caption Sir Elton John performed at Harry and Meghan's wedding\n\nCarbon offsetting allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flights.\n\nThe money is then invested in environmental projects - such as planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount.\n\nThe duke said that what is important is \"what we do to balance out\" negative effects.\n\nHe went on to say that he has always offset his carbon emissions and will continue to do so.\n\n\"In my mind it's the right thing to do and we need to make it cool,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to connect people to where that little bit of extra money is actually going.\"\n\nPrince Harry has spent three years working on the project alongside five co-founders - Booking.com, Ctrip, Skyscanner, TripAdvisor and Visa.\n\nHe hopes it will improve conservation, environmental protection and help increase the economic benefits of tourism for local communities.\n\nFigures from accounts published in June show the royal household's carbon emissions due to business travel almost doubled last year.\n\nThe increase was put down to the use of chartered flights for more overseas visits, which are planned by the Foreign Office.\n\nHowever, emissions savings from greener heating and lighting meant the household's overall carbon footprint stayed around the same as the previous year.", "description": "The Duke of Sussex responds to criticism of his travel at the launch of an eco-tourism project.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F289/production/_108598026_6d2f14fd-d987-428c-9219-a035ed092a23.jpg"}
