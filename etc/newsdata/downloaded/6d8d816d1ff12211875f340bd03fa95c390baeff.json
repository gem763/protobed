We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table.\"\n\nThe move was criticised as too little, too late by the top Democrat in Congress.\n\nUS House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: \"His announcement of a package of sanctions against Turkey falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster.\"\n\nTurkey aims to neutralize the Kurdish YPG militia, the main element of Washington's Kurdish-led ally, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nThe group has been a key US ally in dismantling the jihadist \"caliphate\" set up by Islamic State militants in Syria.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBut Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish insurgents.\n\nYesterday, Russia-backed Syrian forces deployed deep inside territory in Syria held by US-backed Kurdish forces south of the Turkish frontier.\n\nWashington said on Sunday it was pulling out its entire force of 1,000 troops, which had provided air support, ground assistance and training for Syrian Kurds against Islamic State since 2014.\n\nTrump said US troops would remain at a small garrison at Tanf in southern Syria \"to continue to disrupt remnants\" of Islamic State.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBut the base would do little to support operations elsewhere in the country.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, better known for his backing of Trump, joined his critics to express concern over the Syria pullout, saying it would \"invite the resurgence\" of Islamic State.\n\n\"Such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States' strategic interests,\" he said in a statement.\n\nIn a speech during a visit to Azerbaijan, Erdogan said: \"We are determined to continue the operation until the end, without paying attention to threats.\"\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\n\"Our battle will continue until ultimate victory is achieved,\" he added.\n\nThe Turkish Defence Ministry said 560 militants had been \"neutralised\" since the operation began. Earlier, Erdogan said 500 militants had been killed, 26 surrendered and 24 were wounded so far.\n\nThe Syrian army deployment is a victory for President Bashar al-Assad and his most powerful ally, Russia.\n\nIt gives the Syrian-Russian alliance a foothold in the biggest remaining swath of the country that had been beyond their grasp.", "description": "The US President called Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and signed an order imposing sanctions after he was blamed for sparking fresh conflict in northern Syria", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Anadolu Agency Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582300.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_trump-sanctions-main.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
