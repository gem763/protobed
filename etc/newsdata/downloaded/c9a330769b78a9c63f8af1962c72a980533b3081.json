It\u2019s uplifting,\u201d Ivanyuk said. \u201cI expected he would show these kinds of results.\u201d\n\n(This story was republished to remove incorrect reference to Akimenko clearing 2.35 metres on his third attempt in seveth para)", "description": "A few weeks before the world championships, silver medallist high jumper Mikhail Akimenko didn't think he would compete, let alone step onto the podium.", "authors": ["Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437176844&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931P5", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
