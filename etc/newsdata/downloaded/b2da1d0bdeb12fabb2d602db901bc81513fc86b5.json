This could be particularly true if you\u2019ve recently been arrested for anything. The outlet, named WEHOville, has been running a list of everyone that\u2019s taken downtown by the cops and some of the locals are not happy about this at all. (CBS Los Angeles)\n\nAn online publication is now allowing its users to view who has been arrested in West Hollywood including names, ages and the crime they \u2014 for alleged crimes from misdemeanors to felonies. Some in the tight-knit community said they are upset and called this nothing more than public shaming, but the man behind WEHOville said residents have the right to know. \u201cWEHOville is committed to publishing the facts about life in West Hollywood, without fear or favor,\u201d publisher Hank Scott said in a statement. \u201cThose facts have included the felony convictions of a recent city commissioner and revelations of lawsuits against various people who have run for City Council.\u201d\n\nSo is this legal? In a word, yes. But one legal analyst from the area described it as lawful, but awful. Another neighbor called it \u201cpublic shaming.\u201d\n\nBut is it really? WEHOville has already posted the names of people arrested for crimes ranging from driving on a suspended license all the way up to rape. If you are arrested, even if it turns out you\u2019re innocent, that\u2019s news and it\u2019s made available to the media by law enforcement. When more famous people such as celebrities, politicians and athletes are arrested, the press rushes to put the news out long before they are even officially charged, to say nothing of convicted. Is there some unwritten rule saying that the hoi polloi are granted some level of privacy that the powerful and famous are not?\n\nWhen I was on assignment with a couple of other people for an extended period in Chattanooga, Tennessee some years ago, we always picked up a copy of a weekly paper called \u201cJust Busted in Chattanooga.\u201d We didn\u2019t even know anyone down there, but it was still an entertaining read. One of our local contacts we worked with always grabbed our copy as soon as we showed up and started flipping through it to see if anyone she knew was in there.\n\nLet\u2019s face it. This may not be the noblest endeavor in the history of journalism, but most people like to gossip sometimes whether they admit it or not. And if you get arrested, your friends and neighbors generally wind up finding out about it anyway. One of the objections being raised by one person in West Hollywood is that the information will be on the internet forever and \u201ca potential employer\u201d or \u201csomebody you might be interested in dating\u201d could Google your name and see it.\n\nI suppose that may be true, but if you\u2019ve been arrested for rape, might not a woman you are asking out want to at least know about that and look into the details further? If you\u2019ve been arrested for embezzlement or fraud, your potential employer would probably like to know that as well. And if the guy running this website isn\u2019t breaking any laws, trying to drive him out of business sounds more like a case of you shaming him.", "description": "Sorry, not sorry?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MugShot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
