Fingers crossed it doesn\u2019t affect anyone negatively.'\n\nSurreal: Jameela, 33, revisited her anger on the topic as she re-tweeted an interesting insight from cosmetic doctor Dr Tijion Esho who turned down the chance to work on the show\n\nCaroline retweeted Jameela in turn, hitting back by insisting that those seeking free surgery on the show are 'people not contestants'\n\nShe tweeted: 'As you know self image is a complicated, sensitive and personal subject.\n\n'At the heart of this show are people not contestants who have sought help to want to better them selves in their own eyes. Their stories deserve to be told and not ridiculed online.'\n\nWhen quizzed about her comments by a disgruntled follower, Caroline responded: 'You really need to watch it .. it\u2019s a discussion show.'\n\nHitting back: Caroline was quick to respond after seeing Jameela had tweeted once again\n\nHitting back: Caroline retweeted Jameela in turn, hitting back by insisting that those seeking free surgery on the show are 'people not contestants'\n\nClearing things up: When quizzed about her comments by a disgruntled follower, Caroline insisted that all judgement should be reserved until the series airs\n\nAnd while Caroline was responding to her followers, Jameela was doing the same, as a follower asked if it was 'fair' to target Caroline, Jameela hit back: 'I didn\u2019t go for Caroline. I said the show sounded like black mirror, and Caroline came for me over it.\n\n'I was not criticizing her. She didn\u2019t create the show. I hope it doesn\u2019t cause adverse effects on young people. Reality Tv is so insane these days. A jury judging bodies is wild.'\n\nAs they debated over whether it had been necessary to tag Caroline in her tweets, Jameela responded: 'Just questioning your slight double standard here, questioning me for responding?\n\n'The unfortunate thing is it\u2019s always the woman of colour who gets tone policed for speaking back to the white person. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not your intention.'\n\nMore to say: While Caroline was responding to her followers, Jameela was doing the same, as a follower asked if it was 'fair' to target Caroline\n\nDebate: Jameela was caught up in a lengthy debate with one of her followers who questioned the star's decision to tweet Caroline about the new show\n\nFollowing her spat with Caroline, Jameela wrote and pinned a tweet with a huge 'WARNING' label, which reiterated her point.\n\nIt read: 'Just wanna remind everyone that teenage cosmetic surgery numbers are the highest they\u2019ve ever been. Teenage suicide/self harm numbers are the highest they\u2019ve ever been.\n\n'Teenage eating disorders are the highest they\u2019ve ever been. This is why I never shut up. Fix it and I\u2019ll chill.'\n\nWarning: Following her spat with Caroline, Jameela wrote and pinned a tweet with a huge 'WARNING' label, which reiterated her point\n\nThe Good Place actress first laid into Caroline's controversial new show, The Surjury, on Friday before it has even aired, causing a war of words to erupt on Twitter.\n\nJameela posted a story about Caroline's new show and wrote: 'Welp. Black Mirror is officially happening guys. It's here.'\n\nBut Caroline quickly wrote back: 'Have you managed to see a copy before me ? Please forward .. am desperate to see..'\n\nShe's not impressed: Jameela loves to attack women who do things she doesn't agree with - sometimes justified - but Caroline wasn't taking her words lying down\n\nTwo sides to every story: Caroline had some choice words for Jameela after her post\n\nThe premise of The Surjury is that participants will go under the knife if they are given the thumbs-up by a 12-strong jury.\n\nContestants will have to secure 75 per cent of the jury vote to get their procedure, and then will be invited back to 'show off the results' after a few months.\n\nCaroline's new show recently wrapped up filming in Manchester, and is expected to air on Channel 4 in early 2020.\n\nBut following Jameela's post, a fan tweeted Caroline: 'How can you be so defensive about a show this toxic and exploitative that you're willingly hosting?'\n\nShe replied: 'Because I've filmed it and the people who have taken part are amazing and have been through a lot and life is about individual choice...'\n\nSorry, what? But Caroline seemed confused as to why Jameela was attacking the show before she has even seen it\n\nAnother fan then wrote: 'Are you saying it's not how the article suggested? Is it done in a 'positive, compassionate way'?\n\n'After reading about your personal journey with your mental health I'm surprised at your choice of job but ultimately they would have got another presenter.'\n\nCaroline responded: 'Well mental health is a sensitive subject and as we progress we are constantly asked to be more open and visible.\n\n'My feeling toward the show is that it opens up conversations on why some people turn to surgery to help them lead the life that they believe will make them happier.'\n\nHappy to talk: Caroline answered fans who had questions about the show and explained why she felt happy to present it despite its controversial nature\n\nOpen and honest: Caroline said the show goes a lot deeper than one might think and addresses why people feel the need to get surgery\n\nJameela has had surgery herself, but it's not something she has shied away from talking about.\n\nBack in 2018, she addressed the subject with a fan and tweeted: 'Mine? Yes 100 percent. I had my breasts reduced because my back was hurting.\n\n'And have no problem with cosmetic surgery of any kind but would always publicly own it as I see no shame in doing it. I see huge shame in hiding it.'\n\nIt's true that Jameela has not seen the show yet and a Channel 4 spokesperson insists the main focus is actually about giving people confidence.\n\nA Channel 4 rep previously told The Sun: 'Rather than wag a disapproving finger, this new series looks at who wants it, and why \u2013 and allows those who make a strong enough case to their peers, to undergo the procedure of their choice.\n\n'The show will neither glamourise nor condemn their choices: the aim is instead to interrogate the realities. All contributors featured in the series have actively been seeking surgery of their own accord.'\n\nThey're not a fan: At first glance, it appears as though Jameela has a lot of support for her words as many thought the show's concept was questionable\n\nRoss McCarthy, executive producer for show creators Gobstopper Television, added: 'This is a totally new way of doing peer-to- peer advice.\n\n'Our pitchers will either get the surgery they've always wanted, or a massive boost in confidence when the public rules they don't need work at all!'\n\nCaroline first announced the news that she would be presenting the show on social media, writing: 'Over the Mooooooon to be hosting my first @channel4 show \u2764\ufe0f #thesurjury.'\n\nHer words: Jameela has made no secret of her own personal journey with plastic surgery and shared this in 2018\n\nControversy: Earlier this year, surgeons condemned the programme for 'glamorising' procedures (file photo)\n\nEarlier this year, medical professionals warned of the potential harm of the programme, saying it glamorises and trivialises life-changing procedures, and could lead to a rise in botched surgeries.\n\nChannel 4 director Ian Katz said the aim of the broadcaster was to 'make entertaining, mischievous and innovative shows about the big issues and arguments in Britain today'.\n\nThe British Association Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) president and surgeon Mark Henley said: 'We are extremely concerned about the message this programme portrays and its particular focus on young people.\n\n'Based on the promotional materials alone, we believe the show will trivialise the serious decision all should take when considering aesthetic procedures.\n\n'It is disappointing that, in 2019, we are still having to remind large broadcasters of the potential harm caused by glamorising cosmetic surgery - particularly when targeting young adults or those with self-esteem issues.'\n\nReady to go! In a new Instagram post shared to her account, the Love Island presenter recently enthused she's 'over the moon' to front her first show for Channel 4\n\nChannel 4 said in promoting the show: 'From bum-lifts to nose jobs, sculpted abs to breast enlargements, The Surjury allows people to explore their choices more thoroughly.'\n\nSurgeons have suggested many people who have gone under the knife are less confident after a procedure than they were before.\n\nMark added: 'There is every chance that a show like The Surjury - which asks young people to 'pitch' their 'dream' surgery to a panel - will encourage viewers to rush into personal decisions about cosmetic procedures without considering all outcomes and risks, or taking the time to ensure they visit a reputable surgeon.\n\n'This is particularly a concern given the frequency with which BAPRAS surgeons are having to perform complicated reconstructive procedures on individuals who have received 'botched surgery' both at home and abroad.'", "description": "The 'activist', 33, inspired the Love Island host, 39, to hit back, which saw Caroline insist\u00a0those at the heart of the series 'are people not contestants' as she branded it 'a discussion show'", "authors": ["Ellie Phillips For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20060274-0-image-a-83_1571785675857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
