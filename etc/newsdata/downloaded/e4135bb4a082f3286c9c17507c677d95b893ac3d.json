He refers to his specialty as the \u201cextended enterprise,\u201d the network of third parties connected to the formal structure of the corporation itself.\n\nThis extended enterprise has grown out of necessity, as corporations look to drive down costs and race against rivals to take advantage of the latest mapping service or payment platform on the market, he said.\n\nThe result, he said in an interview at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s headquarters, is a business structure that poses a unique set of opportunities and risks.\n\nMr. Kinsella, based in Omaha, Neb., was in town to talk about Deloitte\u2019s fourth extended-enterprise risk-management survey, a global, cross-industry study of 1,055 corporations. Highlights of the conversation:\n\n\u2022The number of elements in the extended enterprise and the volume of activity flowing through them rose about 15% during the past year, according to Mr. Kinsella. The increase was calculated by multiplying the number of connections in these networks by the volume of activity, Mr. Kinsella said.\n\n\u2022During the past three years, 83% of corporations have experienced a problematic incident related to a third party, and half of survey respondents indicated they don\u2019t understand the nature of their third-party relationships.\n\n\u2022Only 1% of corporations said they considered themselves fully prepared to address all important issues related to extended enterprise risk management.\n\nCompanies can improve management of their extended enterprise, even to the point of boosting the bottom line, Mr. Kinsella contends. How so? The first step is to make sure senior leadership and the board itself are aware of the risks associated with the extended enterprise, and monitor them.\n\nStep two, he said, is technology. Companies can buy software platforms for managing their extended enterprise, and deploy more specialized applications within that framework. They also have the option of outsourcing management of third-party risk to yet another third party, a company such as Deloitte.\n\nThe API\n\n\u201cThere is a fundamental shift in the way that innovation happens. It\u2019s no longer done within the four walls of your organization. It\u2019s actually done through ecosystems,\u201d Ross Mason, founder of MuleSoft LLC, said last week at a customer event. MuleSoft, acquired last year by Salesforce.com Inc. for $6.5 billion, helps companies create and manage the pieces of software that enable applications, data and devices to connect to one another.\n\nMuleSoft founder Ross Mason speaking in New York City, Sept. 17, 2019 Photo: Steven Rosenbush / The Wall Street Journal\n\nThis connective tissue, known as the application programming interface, makes it possible for a phone to connect to an app store, or for a restaurant reservation app to mark dinner plans on your calendar.\n\nIt also helps corporations integrate third parties into their own businesses. He calls this the \u201cbroader village.\u201d\n\n\u201cUber didn\u2019t build a payment broker. They used Stripe\u2026They didn\u2019t build telephony\u2026What they did is build in telephony into the application using Twilio , \u201d Mr. Mason said. \u201cThe value of Uber isn\u2019t measured by whether they built maps or telephony. It\u2019s actually measured by the value they provide to consumers.\u201d\n\nThird-Party Robots\n\n\u201cI think that working with a company like VirtualAPT gives us access to technologists that we probably wouldn\u2019t have in a construction company,\u201d said Anthony Colonna, senior vice president for innovative construction solutions at Skanska USA Building Inc., part of multinational Skanska Group.\n\nBryan Colin, VirtualAPT, left, and Anthony Colonna, Skanska Photo: Steven Rosenbush / The Wall Street Journal\n\nHe applies advanced technology to projects such as the redevelopment of LaGuardia Airport and Penn Station in New York. That includes building relationships with startups such as Brooklyn, N.Y.-based VirtualAPT, which uses autonomous robots to capture video.\n\nThose relationships work best when everyone benefits, Mr. Colonna told the Journal last week during a Skanska technology showcase. \u201cThis is the first construction thing we have ever done,\u201d said Bryan Colin, co-founder and CEO of VirtualAPT, which has its roots in advertising and marketing. \u201cTony said we can use this\u2026in an industry we never would have set foot in.\u201d\n\n\u2014Tom Loftus contributed to this article\n\nWrite to Steven Rosenbush at steven.rosenbush@wsj.com", "description": "\u201cNo one and everyone is in charge and it is a bit of a blessing and a curse,\u201d said Dan Kinsella, a partner with Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory, part of Deloitte LLP.", "authors": ["Steven Rosenbush"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109415/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
