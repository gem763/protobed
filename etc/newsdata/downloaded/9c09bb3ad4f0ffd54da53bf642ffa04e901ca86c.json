Cakiroglu defeated China's Cai Zongju in her quarterfinal bout.\n\nHowever, two-time bronze-medallist Kavita Chahal (+81kg) bowed out after a 0-5 loss to Belarus' Katsiaryna Kavaleva.\n\nFor Rani, her next opponent is going to be Thailand's Chuthamat Raksat, who upstaged fifth seed Yuliyanova Asenova. Boro will take on top seed and former Asian Games bronze-medallist Huang Hsiao-Wen.\n\nIn a tactful performance, Mary Kom waited for her chances and defended sharply to ensure that Victoria's plan to impress the judges by throwing in more punches didn't yield results.\n\nThe Indian's huge reservoir of experience came in handy as she swung her right arm masterfully to connect well-placed hooks. Her straight punches were as effective and regularly pierced through Victoria's reasonably strong defence.\n\nPTI\n\nWith this, Mary Kom bettered her own record as the most successful boxer in the history of the marquee tournament.\n\nThe Manipuri, in terms of number of medals won, is in fact numero uno cutting across both the men's and women's competitions.\n\nCuban icon Felix Savon is the most successful in the men's event with seven medals -- six gold and a silver.\n\nEntering into this edition, Mary Kom had six gold and a silver in her kitty but this is the first time, she has secured a world medal in the 51kg category. She had finished a quarterfinalist in this division in the past.\n\nThe latest achievement has only added to her ever-growing legend.\n\nBesides six world titles, Mary Kom's incredible career is also studded with an Olympic bronze medal (2012), five Asian titles, gold medals at the Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games, besides numerous other international top finishes.\n\nThis year alone, she won gold medals at the India Open in Guwahati and President's Cup in Indonesia.\n\nShe is also a member of the Rajya Sabha.\n\nBoth Rani and Boro fetched hard-fought victories, engaged with strong opponents who hardly gave anything away defensively. But the two Indians were remarkably good in counter-attacks.\n\nHowever, three-time Asian medallist Chahal didn't seem up to it and put up a rather sloppy show against a more agile Kavaleva, who got the result merely by hitting straight and clean for most part of the bout.\n\nWith Inputs From PTI.", "description": "Mary Kom secured an unprecedented eighth World Championship medal before debutants Manju Rani and Jamuna Boro also joined her in the semis.
