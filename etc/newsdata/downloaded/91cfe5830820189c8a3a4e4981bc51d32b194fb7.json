Those two, along with fellow Daria Kasatkina and Ekaterina Alexandrova form a cluster of around the top 40 rankings, with some big futures predicted by tennis experts.\n\nAfter her victory, Kazan native Kudermetova spoke to RT Sport about playing in front of her home crowd, the inspiration of \u201chero\u201d Medvedev, friendly rivalry among her contemporaries, and about being \u201cnot young\u201d at only 22.\n\nYou\u2019ve beaten Elina Svitolina, the world no. 4, what are your emotions after that match?\n\nOf course I am really happy because when you beat one of the top 5 players in front of home crowd its a very good feeling. It helped me a lot today because I never played with so many people supporting me like today.\n\nShe seemed a bit irritated, do you think you maybe used that to your advantage?\n\nI\u2019m not sure about it you know I\u2019m trying to focus on my game and try to think what I need to do on the court.\n\nA lot of the other Russian players say how great it is to play at the Kremlin Cup, is it the same for you?\n\nYeah it\u2019s really enjoyable but you know it also has some pressure because you want to play every match like one hundred percent and you want to win every match that you play.\n\nGiven there was a lot of pressure, how relieved are you to get the win?\n\nYou know I just try to play my game, focus on my work and try to enjoy every moment on the court.\n\nWhere does that victory rank in your career?\n\nIt\u2019s very good for me for next season, I have to think I can play with top players and sometimes beat them. I think for me I have some confidence in myself.\n\nThere\u2019s a group of female Russian tennis players now in and around the top 40: yourself, Kasatkina, Alexandrova, Pavlyuchenkova, is there a rivalry between you?\n\nI think we are all friendly and we try to speak every time when we are together and if someone gets a high ranking we try to push and follow her way and try to go up and up.\n\nYou are also very young\u2026\n\nI\u2019m 22 (laughs). Twenty-two is not young! I think I\u2019m not young. We have younger players now like [15-year-old] Coco Gauff and some more junior players. No, I\u2019m young but on the tour there are a few others younger.\n\nThe whole world is talking about Daniil Medvedev, the world no. 4, how much does that motivate the rest of the Russian players?\n\nYou know it\u2019s in men\u2019s tennis not women\u2019s. But he does a really, really good job. Right now here in Russia the people every time support Daniil and I think it\u2019s really nice now.\n\nHow much does his success inspire the country?\n\nI think he gives inspiration for tennis player and like I say before, I think he\u2019s the hero for Russia.\n\nPeople write that he\u2019s a bad boy figure, do you agree with that?\n\nSometimes he\u2019s very emotional on the court. I think it\u2019s ok it\u2019s not bad he just tries to find his way and tries to play. I think for me it\u2019s not bad.\n\nAre you confident of continuing your form into next year?\n\nYou know I try to play the same like today and tomorrow. I hope to yes, maybe even better!\n\nBy Danny Armstrong at Krylatskoye Ice Palace", "description": "Rising tennis star Veronika Kudermetova, who shocked world no. 4 Elina Svitolina at Moscow's Kremlin Cup, insisted while Daniil Medvedev is a \u201chero in Russia\u201d, a healthy rivalry between Russia\u2019s female players is key to success.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da9c47e85f5401b0476f599.png", "published_at": "2019-06-01"}
