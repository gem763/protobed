It is a hypothetical question. It is up to the members of our party to decide who the leader is.\n\n\"John gave an answer to an interview that he undertook. My answer is this: I am leading this party to go into an election. We have hundreds of thousands of members determined to win that election.\"\n\nMr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn have transformed the Labour party together since the latter became leader in 2015.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThat process has been tumultuous, but they have since secured control of the party and shifted its policy offer to be more radical - which they believe will see them swept to power in a general election .\n\nIn a interview with former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell for GQ, said that the pair would fall on their swords if they didn't form the next government.\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn dismissed the claim saying: \"I am determined to get a message that it is only Labour that is going to get a message out there, that it is only Labour that is going to end austerity and invest in a better future for this country. I want to lead the party to do that.\"\n\nHe said there is a \"strong possibility\" that there will be a general election before Christmas.\n\n(Image: Anthony Harvey/REX)\n\nThe Labour leader said the prospects could depend on what happened when Boris Johnson goes to the EU summit this week seeking a Brexit deal.\n\nAsked on Sky News's Sophy Ridge On Sunday about the chances of an election before Christmas, he said: \"That is obviously a strong possibility, We are are ready for an election at any time.\"\n\nHe said that it was \"ludicrous\" for the Government to be holding a Queen's Speech on Monday when it was more than 40 votes short of a Commons majority.\n\n\"It obviously depends on what happens this week, but we have a Government that is now in minus 40, it hasn't yet won a vote in Parliament.\n\n\"Having a Queen's Speech and a State Opening of Parliament tomorrow is ludicrous. What we have got in effect is a party political broadcast from the steps of the throne.\"", "description": "It comes after his close friend John McDonnell said they would both go if Labour does not win", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Pa", "Anthony Harvey Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20570133.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jeremy-Corbyn-speech.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
