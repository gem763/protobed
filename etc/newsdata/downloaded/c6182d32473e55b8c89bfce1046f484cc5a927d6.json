Last year, he handed over the title of \u201cpresident\u201d \u2013 the head of the nation\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature \u2013 to Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, creating the false impression that he had let go of the reins of power.\n\nIn the State Department\u2019s announcement of the new designation \u2013 pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the FY 2019 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act \u2013 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that all of the identified Castros \u201chave been involved in significant corruption or a gross violation of human rights.\u201d\n\nRa\u00fal Castro and three of his children \u2013 Alejandro Castro Esp\u00edn, Deborah Castro Esp\u00edn, Mariela Castro Esp\u00edn, and Nilsa Castro Esp\u00edn \u2013 are officially banned from entering America. Alejandro has run the nation\u2019s counter-intelligence (espionage) services for years and helps his father control the military, though he has taken a less public role since the beginning of President Donald Trump\u2019s tenure. Mariela is the head of the Cuban state-run queer association, CENESEX, which works to repress LGBT Cubans who demand rights from the communist regime.\n\nDeborah and Nilsa do not hold public office, but both are married to high-ranking Cuban military officials. The Cuban military controls not just the nation\u2019s defense infrastructure but owns all major tourism \u201cbusinesses\u201d on the island and plays a key role in keeping the socialist dictatorship of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in power in Venezuela. Estimates suggest there are between tens of thousands and 100,000 Cuban government agents operating in Venezuela to keep Maduro from facing a coup.\n\nPompeo accused Castro and his family of significant crimes against humanity in his statement announcing the new sanctions.\n\n\u201cAs First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party, Raul Castro oversees a system that arbitrarily detains thousands of Cubans and currently holds more than 100 political prisoners,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cAs First Secretary of Cuba\u2019s Armed Forces, Castro is responsible for Cuba\u2019s actions to prop up the former Maduro regime in Venezuela through violence, intimidation, and repression.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn concert with Maduro\u2019s military and intelligence officers, members of the Cuban security forces have been involved in gross human rights violations and abuses in Venezuela, including torture,\u201d the statement elaborates. \u201cCastro is complicit in undermining Venezuela\u2019s democracy and triggering the hemisphere\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis, forcing 15 percent of the Venezuelan population to flee the country and precipitating a food shortage and health crisis of unprecedented scale in this region.\u201d\n\nThe Cuban people have suffered under the brutal Castro regime for over half a century, but Pompeo concludes by promising the people of Venezuela that America \u201cwill continue to pursue all diplomatic and economic tools to help the Venezuelan people achieve the transition they deserve.\u201d\n\nWhile Pompeo prioritized the Venezuelan people over the Cubans in his statement, the designation will help the Cuban exile community make a legal case in international court against the Castro regime for crimes against humanity. Justice Cuba, an independent commission compiling the legal evidence for precisely such a case, has successfully urged at least three Latin American countries to consider leveling charges of crimes against humanity against the Castro regime.\n\nWith probable cause, any nation in the world can bring charges of crimes against humanity against an accused individual, typically a world leader. The legal definition of crimes against humanity is a series of acts \u201ccommitted as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.\u201d The United Nations lists \u201cmurder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer \u2026 imprisonment, torture, rape, [and] sexual slavery\u201d as examples of the acts that constitute evidence of the crime.\n\nThe Justice Cuba commission has presented before the Organization of American States (OAS) evidence that the Castro regime has, in the past 60 years, run labor camps to enslave political dissidents, holds prisoners of conscience, has murdered and tortured dissidents, and killed refugees fleeing the country, including children as young as five months old. The Castro regime has also aided terrorist organizations such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Hezbollah, and offered refuge to American criminal refugees such as Joanne Chesimard, who killed a police officer in 1973.\n\nThe Cuban regime has not, at press time, responded to the Castro family designation on Thursday. Instead, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, Granma, featured D\u00edaz-Canel clamoring for Cuba to invest more heavily in \u201cideological preparation\u201d to \u201cdismantle the imperialists\u2019 schemes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is not a single person or group that can assume with commitment moments like these if they are not well prepared ideologically, if they don\u2019t know the origin of this situation, which is part of the battle against the empire\u201d D\u00edaz-Canel said at an event on Thursday. Cuban communists refer to America as \u201cthe empire\u201d derisively; D\u00edaz-Canel was referring to the Trump administration\u2019s pro-human rights policies against Cuba. \u201cWe are dismantling the imperialists\u2019 schemes, we are dismantling the imposition of neo-liberal colonization that they want to impose on us.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The U.S. Department of State designated Ra\u00fal Castro and four family members on Thursday, banning them from entering the United States.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/Ra\u00fal-Castro.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
