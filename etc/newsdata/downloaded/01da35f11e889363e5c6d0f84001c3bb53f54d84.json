One section will seek to question the legitimacy of the Mueller probe generally by alleging \u201cpossible conflicts\u201d of interest by federal law enforcement authorities. The other section will respond to more substantive allegations of Trump campaign collusion with Russian government agents to sway the 2016 election, and obstruction of justice allegations stemming from, among other things, the president\u2019s firing of former FBI director James Comey.\n\nThough this latter section will focus on the meat of Mueller\u2019s investigation, Giuliani acknowledged that he doesn\u2019t actually know what Mueller\u2019s findings will look like, making the act of putting a counter-report together a bit more challenging.\n\n\u201cSince we have to guess what it is, [our report so far] is quite voluminous,\u201d Giuliani said, claiming that he would spend much of this weekend \u201cparing it down\u201d and that he was editing the document created by the \u201cwhole team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first half of it is 58 pages, and second half isn't done yet\u2026 It needs an executive summary if it goes over a hundred,\u201d he added. Giuliani also indicated that most of what\u2019s being put together by him and his Trump-defending colleagues currently can already be found on Google.\n\nGiuliani said that Trump\u2019s legal team had not conducted any original interviews or investigation for their current draft.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there's anything in it that isn't publicly available in some form or another,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere is no [secret] grand jury material here\u2026 It'll be our report, put out on... personal stationery, and it would be in response to their report\u2026 We may have to use it in court, or [send to] Congress.\u201d\n\nGiuliani also mentioned that Trump\u2019s legal team is considering devoting a section of the report to revelations surrounding former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty last week to a number of federal crimes, including campaign finance violations in which he directly implicated the president.\n\nGlenn Kirschner, a retired federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., said it was highly unusual for a rebuttal report to be authored by lawyers for potential subjects of an investigation, and virtually unheard of for it to be put together prior to the investigation\u2019s findings being made public.\n\n\u201cThis sounds to me like pure PR nonsense,\u201d Kirschner said. \u201cThey are making an announcement that they will issue a rebuttal to a report that we don\u2019t know when it is coming out or what it will contain.\u201d\n\nKirschner said he believed the entire exercise was being done for the purposes of trying to \u201cpoison the well\u201d for Mueller, as there was virtually zero likelihood that Giuliani and others would admit to any wrongdoing on the part of Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess that they will find no obstruction or collusion,\u201d Kirschner said.\n\nThe Trump team\u2019s counter-report has been in the works since late July. Giuliani briefly mentioned the \u201creport\u201d in a tweet earlier this month, but little information about the actual document has been reported since.\n\nAmong those working on it are Giuliani and fellow Trump attorney Jay Sekulow along with their colleague on Trump\u2019s legal team, Marty Raskin. Sekulow would only tell The Daily Beast that the president\u2019s legal team is \u201cpreparing a comprehensive report that will include issues related to the commencement of this investigation through the legal issues of it.\u201d A number of attorneys who work with Sekulow at his nonprofit legal group, the American Center for Law and Justice, are assisting with the report, though they are not doing so in their capacity as ACLJ employees, and the organization is not involved in its formation.\n\nSekulow declined to go into detail about the report\u2019s contents, or conversations he\u2019s had with the president about it.\n\nGiuliani, who said the report was \u201cprobably\u201d his idea, was more forthcoming, telling The Daily Beast that the president is aware of the report and Trump \u201cknows it is part of our [legal] strategy and he\u2019s happy with it.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he aims for the preliminary draft of the \u201ccounter-report\u201d to be \u201cin pretty good shape by next week.\u201d A source familiar with the process said those involved expect the counter-report to be ready to go in the next two to three weeks. The same source said that the initial deadline for the Trump team\u2019s draft was Sept. 1, the date that Giuliani previously said that he expected Mueller\u2019s investigation to wrap up. That appears unlikely to happen, so Trump\u2019s legal team now hopes to have its counter-report ready to go once Mueller does submit his findings.\n\nGiuliani suggested that his report could be released sooner if he gets a sense that Team Mueller \u201cleaks theirs\u201d or part of their findings. He also acknowledged that the entire process could be derailed by developments in the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cIt may all be for naught,\u201d Giuliani said, \u201cbecause they may subpoena [the president], and then we'd have to turn our attention to fighting the subpoena.\u201d\n\nThe report\u2019s apparent focus on the roots of the Mueller investigation tracks with tactics taken by Trump\u2019s chief defenders in Congress\u2014notably House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) and House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.). It also aligns with lines of attack taken by Trump\u2019s favorite cable news personalities and informal advisers, such as Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs.\n\nTrump himself routinely tweets about the \u201cangry Democrats\u201d on Mueller\u2019s investigative team. Efforts to paint the Mueller investigation as the fruit of a poisoned tree have been fueled by revelations that senior FBI officials such as Peter Strzok, who was recently fired, harbored intense private antipathy towards Trump.\n\nAn examination of the roots of the investigation could also touch on the process by which the FBI obtained a foreign intelligence surveillance warrant against one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Some of the evidence presented to obtain that warrant was produced by former British spy Christopher Steele on behalf of the firm Fusion GPS, a subcontractor for both conservative entities and, subsequently, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u2014With additional reporting by Sam Stein", "description": "It\u2019s being done with the explicit blessing of Trump who is \u2018happy\u2019 that this is part of his legal team\u2019s \u2018strategy,\u2019 the president\u2019s lawyer says.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Lachlan Markay", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1535658591/180830-swin-lach-rudy-tease_ppkzqe", "published_at": "2018-08-30"}
