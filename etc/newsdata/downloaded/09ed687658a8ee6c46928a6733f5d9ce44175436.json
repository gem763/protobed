Liu has recommended moving forward with charges for fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe after he lied under oath multiple times to federal investigators.\n\nLast year McCabe was referred to the U.S. Attorney for criminal charges by the Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz. After a lengthy investigation, Horowitz found McCabe lied to FBI agents, Inspector General agents and improperly leaked sensitive information to the media. At the time of that referral, McCabe's lawyers were confident their client wouldn't be pursued.\n\n\"We were advised of the referral within the past few weeks. Although we believe the referral is unjustified, the standard for an IG referral is very low,\" McCabe's attorney released in a statement at the time. \"We have already met with staff members from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. We are confident that, unless there is inappropriate pressure from high levels of the Administration, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office will conclude that it should decline to prosecute.\"\n\nFrom the IG report:\n\nWe found that, in a conversation with then-Director Comey shortly after the WSJ article was published, McCabe lacked candor when he told Comey, or made statements that led Comey to believe, that McCabe had not authorized the disclosure and did not know who did. This conduct violated FBI Offense Code 2.5 (Lack of Candor \u2013 No Oath).\n\n\n\nWe also found that on May 9, 2017, when questioned under oath by FBI agents from INSD, McCabe lacked candor when he told the agents that he had not authorized the disclosure to the WSJ and did not know who did. This conduct violated FBI Offense Code 2.6 (Lack of Candor \u2013 Under Oath).\n\n\n\nWe further found that on July 28, 2017, when questioned under oath by the OIG in a recorded interview, McCabe lacked candor when he stated: (a) that he was not aware of Special Counsel having been authorized to speak to reporters around October 30 and (b) that, because he was not in Washington, D.C., on October 27 and 28, 2016, he was unable to say where Special Counsel was or what she was doing at that time. This conduct violated FBI Offense Code 2.6 (Lack of Candor \u2013 Under Oath).\n\n\n\nWe additionally found that on November 29, 2017, when questioned under oath by the OIG in a recorded interview during which he contradicted his prior statements by acknowledging that he had authorized the disclosure to the WSJ, McCabe lacked candor when he: (a) stated that he told Comey on October 31, 2016, that he had authorized the disclosure to the WSJ; (b) denied telling INSD agents on May 9 that he had not authorized the disclosure to the WSJ about the PADAG call; and (c) asserted that INSD\u2019s questioning of him on May 9 about the October 30 WSJ article occurred at the end of an unrelated meeting when one of the INSD agents pulled him aside and asked him one or two questions about the article. This conduct violated FBI Offense Code 2.6 (Lack of Candor \u2013 Under Oath).\n\n\n\nLastly, we determined that as Deputy Director, McCabe was authorized to disclose the existence of the CF Investigation publicly if such a disclosure fell within the \u201cpublic interest\u201d exception in applicable FBI and DOJ policies generally prohibiting such a disclosure of an ongoing investigation. However, we concluded that McCabe\u2019s decision to confirm the existence of the CF Investigation through an anonymously sourced quote, recounting the content of a phone call with a senior Department official in a manner designed to advance his personal interests at the expense of Department leadership, was clearly not within the public interest exception. We therefore concluded that McCabe\u2019s disclosure of the existence of an ongoing investigation in this manner violated the FBI\u2019s and the Department\u2019s media policy and constituted misconduct.\n\n\n\nAfter he was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2018, McCabe set up a GoFund me page and received more than $500,000. Two weeks ago he was hired by CNN.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information.\n\n", "description": ".10/02/2019 13:07:22PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/261/c260b580-08db-486e-9fab-2dae254d06a2.jpg"}
