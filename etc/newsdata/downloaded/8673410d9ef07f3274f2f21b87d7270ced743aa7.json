It was a reckless act.\u2019\n\nThe 16-year-old, who cannot be named, placed the yellow hire bike in front of Michael as he sped down a road in Hartcliffe (Picture: PA)\n\nDuring trial, prosecutor Adam Vaitilingam QC said the motorbike Mr Rice had been riding on April 5 had been stolen a day earlier.\n\nMr Rice was from the Knowle West area of Bristol and was riding around the Hartcliffe area in a \u2018provocative way\u2019, he told jurors.\n\nThe keen motorcyclist first passed the Fulford Arms pub Road once, drawing attention to himself from a crowd of children and young people outside.\n\nWhen he returned a second time some of those gathered suggested blocking the road to stop him \u2013 with one emerging on a bicycle to face him.\n\nThe teenager, then 15, grabbed hold of the YoBike and dragged it into the road.\n\nThe motorcycle had been stolen the day before (Picture: PA)\n\nCollision investigators calculated that Mr Rice was travelling between 52mph and 55mph at the time of the impact with the YoBike.\n\nJudge Blair said it would have been possible for Mr Rice to have stopped to avoid the bike but he was accelerating and pulling a \u2018wheelie\u2019 at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was not the impact of the motorcycle with the bicycle which led to the fatality,\u2019 the judge said.\n\n\u2018Instead it was his panicked reaction to what was in front of him in the road which led to him applying the front brake lever while the front wheel was still in the air.\n\n\u2018Tragically, that led to him going over the handlebars of the motorcycle when it touched down and he was killed in an instant when he collided with a parked van.\u2019\n\nIn a victim personal statement, Mr Rice\u2019s mother Donna Rice described how her son \u2018was a loving, caring person\u2019.\n\n\u2018It feels like so long since we have been able to see Mike\u2019s cheeky smile and hear his infectious laugh,\u2019 she added.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Detective Chief Inspector James Riccio, of Avon and Somerset Police, paid tribute to the \u2018courage and dignity\u2019 Mrs Rice and her family had shown throughout the case.\n\n\u2018We appreciate that to Michael\u2019s family and the wider community this sentence may seem lenient,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018We are now looking to consider making a formal appeal to have the sentence reviewed.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
