Secrets of Sugar Baby Dating, a new documentary from The Passionate Eye, explores online platforms aiming to connect high-net-worth individuals and young, attractive people. To stay on the right side of the law, the sites often say that they prohibit prostitution and escorting.\n\nThe very nature of a so-called sugar arrangement, however, brings together the worlds of money and intimacy \u2014 opening up a grey area between dating and sex work that can lure young people in financially precarious situations. And sometimes, those people are cash-strapped students.\n\nSugar dating in Canadian universities\n\nOne such website specifically markets to teens and young adults in college.\n\nSeeking Arrangement has dedicated a section of its website to \u201cSugar Baby University,\u201d positioning sugar dating as a fun, lucrative way to avoid student debt and boost career opportunities.\n\nThe Canadian version of the platform claims that more than 300,000 Canadian students use its services to meet \u201csugar daddies\u201d or \u201csugar mommies.\u201d\n\nOne UK student talks about the temptation of sugar dating.\n\nAccording to Seeking Arrangement, the University of Toronto, York University, University of Waterloo, McGill University and Carleton University are the top 5 \u2018fastest growing sugar baby schools of 2019\u2019\n\nWhat is sugar dating?\n\nIn the documentary, BBC journalist Tiffany Sweeney creates a profile on Seeking Arrangement\u2019s U.K. site, that promises to introduce \u201cwealthy men to beautiful women.\u201d\n\nIn Sweeney\u2019s fake profile, she says she is 18 years old and attending university. She posts pictures of herself fully clothed in casual wear. Sweeney writes a neutral profile and responds to messages in non-flirtatious language.\n\nSweeney says the aim was to see how sugar daddies would attempt to start a \u201crelationship\u201d without any direction from her.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, out of the hundreds of messages that I received, I would say there were only a couple [responses] where the men showed an interest in me, in my fake profile,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cThey would ask me, \u2018What are you studying?\u2019 and things like that to show interest in me.\n\n\u201cBut the majority were basically like, \u2018Do you want to have sex for x amount of money in a hotel room? I can meet you there.\u2019 And they were straight to the point.\u201d\n\nValentina and Luke: Sugar dating in the U.K.\n\nThe documentary features 18-year-old Valentina, a student in London who has seven sugar daddies and brings in thousands of dollars each month. Most of the men are more than 40 years old, and she says the relationships are both emotional and sexual.\n\n\u201cI maintain a relationship with these men,\u201d Valentina says in the film. It\u2019s similar to other forms of dating, she explains, except she is being \u201cfinancially supported.\u201d\n\nLuke, 22, is a student in Nottingham who created a profile when he struggled to afford food and rent. He went on a few dates with a man in his mid-50s before agreeing to have sex, for which he is paid roughly $100 each time.\n\n\u201cSometimes afterwards,\u201d Luke says in the documentary, \u201cyou kind of do want to just go get back in bed and sort of curl up by yourself \u2014 just to make yourself feel better, really.\u201d\n\nThe two examples are strikingly different: Valentina appears confident and considers the arrangements reasonable; Luke expresses shame, but he still needs the money.\n\n\u201cValentina is, like, the top of the spectrum,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cAn elite sugar baby, if you will.\n\n\u201cThere are extreme cases where girls have made a lot of money, but I think for the majority, it\u2019s like Luke. They don\u2019t really want to do this.\u201d\n\nSugar babies are vulnerable to scams and predators\n\nThe documentary explores how sugar babies on these websites are susceptible to scams and predators.\n\nOne 26-year-old woman living in New York, Chandler, arranged for paid sex with a man she met on Seeking Arrangement. Chandler says the man didn\u2019t pay her after sex, and she eventually went public with her experience \u2014 revealing an alleged predator as other women came forward with the same story about the same man.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a really dangerous side to sugar dating,\u201d Chandler says in the documentary. \u201cEvery time you go up to that hotel room, you don\u2019t know what can happen.\u201d\n\nSugar dating is sex work, says journalist\n\nAfter interviewing a range of sugar babies and having her own experiences with a fake profile, Sweeney agrees that sugar dating \u201ccan be quite dangerous.\u201d\n\nSweeney says such websites appear to be predominantly used by older, wealthy people who want to have sex with young people, with the expectation that cash will be exchanged.\n\n\u201cWhen I started making this documentary, I wanted to understand how different sugar dating is to escorting and prostitution,\u201d she says in the film. \u201cI personally think sugar dating is sex work. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other way of saying it.\u201d\n\nWatch Secrets of Sugar Baby Dating on The Passionate Eye.", "description": "\u2018I personally think sugar dating is sex work.
