What can they get done?", "language": "en", "text": "THE LIGHTBULB\n\nSen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) (Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nIt has been about a decade since the Senate seriously kicked around ideas for tackling climate change on a bipartisan basis. Now, two senators are hoping to change that.\n\nSens. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) announced Wednesday they are forming the first Senate bipartisan caucus focused on finding solutions to climate change that both Democrats and Republicans can agree on.\n\nBut the senators have a tough road ahead of them if they want to build legislation on an issue that many Republicans, including President Trump, refuse to acknowledge as a scientific reality. The new caucus is a sign while moderate compromises are possible, a big comprehensive bipartisan climate bill is still far away. But the pair suggested a deal may be what's necessary to address the warming of the planet in the long term.\n\n\"I'm dear friends with Joe Donnelly,\" Coons said of the Indiana Democrat that Braun unseated last year. \"One of the challenges of serving here is you've got to be willing to extend your hand and say, 'Great to meet you. Welcome to the Senate. What can we work together on?' \"\n\nBraun, who halls from a state hit this year with devastating floods, does not count himself among those doubters about human contributions to rising temperatures. \u201cI just know when you put carbon into the air, it creates a greenhouse effect,\u201d he said in an interview with Coons. \u201cThat's chemistry and physics. And I think if you keep doing it, it's going to get harder to fix than nipping it in the bud.\u201d\n\nThe creation of the caucus comes as many Senate Democrats, including those running to unseat Trump from the White House, pitch a series of proposals for curbing greenhouse gas emissions far more aggressive than what was pursued during the Obama administration, spooking many conservatives.\n\nYet at the same time, a handful of Washington Republicans are cautiously wading into the debate about how Congress can combat climate change, often by promoting innovations in types of carbon power generation with little to no carbon footprint. The last time Republicans and Democrats in the Senate seriously tried hammering out a climate bill with a chance of passing was the cap-and-trade bill in 2010.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of private conversations, and now some of those conversations are becoming public,\u201d said Alex Flint, executive director of the Alliance for Market Solutions, a group of conservative business leaders interested in advancing a revenue-neutral carbon tax. \u201cAs the politics of climate change are evolving, Republican members in particular have struggled to identify policies\u201d to support.\n\nOnly one other Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski from the quickly warming state of Alaska, has committed to joining the caucus so far, though Braun expects to add more Republican members in the coming weeks. The two senators want to keep an equal number of Republicans and Democrats in the caucus.\n\n\u201cStay tuned,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Del.). (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nA similar climate caucus in the House is still trying to find its footing after its Republican ranks were decimated in the 2018 elections. Rep. Francis Rooney, who replaced fellow South Florida Republican Carlos Curbelo as the top GOP member of the House Climate Solutions Caucus, has struggled to find more than just one other GOP co-sponsor for a carbon tax bill designed to cut payroll taxes. And Rooney recently announced his retirement in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe haven't had a lot of success recruiting a lot of co-sponsors,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cBut there are more Republicans talking about climate change as something that needs to be addressed. So I'll take that as optimistically a good step.\u201d\n\nPlacing a price on carbon, which would encourage companies to invest in lower-emission methods of generating electricity and moving people around, is popular among many economists. Even some elder GOP statesmen have warmed to the idea. Former secretaries of state James A. Baker III and George P. Shultz have suggested putting in place a $40-per-ton tax of carbon dioxide.\n\nBoth Braun and Coons said they are willing to consider that and other carbon pricing mechanisms. \u201cI'm open to anything because I believe in science and markets and technology. You take those three things, I think that's what's going to drive us to solving the issue of climate change,\u201d Braun said.\n\nBut the Baker-Shultz proposal comes with a compromise: In exchange for taxing carbon emissions, Congress would cut air regulations and limit lawsuits against oil companies.\n\n\u201cIn my caucus, the idea of permanently rolling back all regulatory power for the EPA for greenhouse gases?\u201d Coons said. \u201cThat's a tough sell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think that would happen,\u201d Braun added.\n\nBraun said he and Coons hope to pick off \u201clow-hanging fruit,\" or legislative ideas that should find broad bipartisan support.\n\nThat may include more research dollars toward clean energy and improvements in energy efficiency, Coons said. Among the ideas that Braun, who chairs the Senate Environmental and Public Works subcommittee on nuclear safety, backs is investing in the next generation of smaller and conceptually safer nuclear reactions.\n\nBut there are clearly limits to the comradery. Last week, Braun and most Senate Republicans voted to keep a Trump administration regulation on coal-fired power plants that congressional Democrats have decried as too weak.\n\nTrump doubled down on that message in a speech during a shale conference Wednesday in Pittsburgh by promoting his reversal of environmental policies under Obama, including the repeal of the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions from coal plants and the approval of permits for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.\n\n\u201cI promised that, as president, I\u2019d unleash American energy like never before, because our natural resources do not belong to the government,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey belong to the people of this country. And I am proud to declare that I have delivered on every single promise I made.\u201d He later said: \u201cYou\u2019ll never have another president like me. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\n\u2014 More on Trump's Pittsburgh speech:\n\nTrump heaped praise on his administration\u2019s energy efforts: Trump said the energy industry was \u201cunder assault\u201d when he entered the White House. He pointed to an liquefied natural gas plant he recently visited in Louisiana, which he said was a \u201cdead project, and I had it approved almost immediately.\u201d CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale pointed out, however, that it got it approvals during the Obama administration.\n\nTrump said the energy industry was \u201cunder assault\u201d when he entered the White House.

Harold Hamm introduced Trump: The oil and gas business executive and Trump campaign donor called the president a \u201cchampion for U.S. energy.\u201d Trump returned the favor by telling a story about Hamm and paper straws. He said former football coach Barry Switzer once said about Hamm in a meeting: \u201c\u2019You know, sir, that guy could take a straw\u2019 \u2014 probably the plastic ones before they changed them. The paper straws aren\u2019t working too well \u2014 \u2018Sir, he could take a straw and put it into the ground and oil comes out.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe oil and gas business executive and Trump campaign donor called the president a \u201cchampion for U.S. energy.\u201d Trump returned the favor by telling a story about Hamm and paper straws.

California's response: California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) painted it as just the latest in the administration's \"political vendetta against California, our climate policies and the health of our communities.\"\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry. (Alex Edelman/Bloomberg News)\n\n\u2014 Perry on the record: Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in an interview with Hugh Hewitt that he never heard Trump mention former vice president Joe Biden during his conversations with him about Ukraine.\n\nTo quote: \"In our conversations dealing with this issue, I never heard the President say the words Biden. I never heard the word Biden mentioned, not from him, not from staff, not from the EU ambassador, not from Kurt Volker. Never one time was that said.\"\n\n\"In our conversations dealing with this issue, I never heard the President say the words Biden. I never heard the word Biden mentioned, not from him, not from staff, not from the EU ambassador, not from Kurt Volker. Never one time was that said.\" But: Perry couldn't explain why Trump brought up Bidenduring the now infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which is at the center of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. \"I have no idea, you know, when the President said it on that phone call, the idea that somehow or another this was the main focus of his effort here,\" Perry said.\n\n\u2014 Air pollution is getting worse, and people are dying: Last year alone, the worsening air quality was linked to nearly 10,000 additional deaths in the United States, compared with the 2016 level, The Post\u2019s Christopher Ingraham reports. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University found that concentrations of fine-particle air pollution, known as PM2.5, rose 5.5 percent since 2016.\n\nWhy this is harmful: \u201cFine particles can damage a person\u2019s respiratory system, accumulate in the brain and send people to the emergency room,\u201d Ingraham writes. \u201cThe elderly appear to be especially susceptible to PM2.5, which has been linked to dementia and cognitive decline. And the data shows that many of the pollutant\u2019s effects occur at levels well below current regulatory thresholds.\u201d\n\nPacific Gas & Electric crews work to restore power lines in Paradise, Calif.
