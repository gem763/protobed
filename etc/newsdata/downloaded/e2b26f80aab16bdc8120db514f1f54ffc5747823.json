Over the years, we\u2019ve mistakenly believed that a number of founders have obtained specific college degrees based on their LinkedIn bio, only to learn offline that they enrolled for some period of time in a particular program that they didn\u2019t complete.\n\nIt happened most recently with the cofounder of a startup who one would might surmise based on his LinkedIn profile has a master\u2019s degree from Harvard but does not. We also misunderstood the CEO of a robotics company to have a PhD based on her LinkedIn. It was our fault; it mentioned under the credit that she\u2019d left to start a company. But anyone scanning the site might have come to the same wrong conclusion. (We pointed this out to her team, and mention of the PhD was deleted.)\n\nIn a higher-profile case, James Damore, the fired Google engineer who authored that infamous memo about the company\u2019s diversity practices and whose LinkedIn page cited under \u201cEducation\u201d a \u201cPhD, Systems Biology,\u201d removed mention of those doctoral studies after Wired confirmed with Harvard that he was enrolled in the program but didn\u2019t complete the doctorate.\n\nDamore tried to defend his own LinkedIn profile, tweeting at the time, \u201cI never told anyone I have a PhD. LinkedIn can\u2019t distinguish between being in the PhD program and having a PhD (I forgot to update it).\u201d\n\nThough few on Twitter found him credible, he wasn\u2019t mistaken on this front. In creating a profile on LinkedIn, the choices one is given are to a.) list a completed degree and leave off anything partially completed, no matter how much time was invested in a program (or minuscule its acceptance rate) or b.) list an incomplete degree without a clear way of explaining that it\u2019s no longer being pursued or whether it will ever be obtained.\n\nLinkedIn doesn\u2019t view the issue as its fault. Asked whether LinkedIn members might be posting incomplete degrees because of the company\u2019s user interface, a spokesperson emailed us today, writing that LinkedIn\u2019s user agreement and \u201cprofessional community policy\u201d guidelines are \u201cclear that members should provide factual information about themselves on LinkedIn.\u201d\n\nAdded this person: \u201cPeople should definitely add their education details to their LinkedIn profile. The education section includes \u2018Start Year\u2019 and \u2018End Year (or expected)\u2019 fields. If a member has a partial degree, we recommend they clearly state the status of their degree within the \u2018Degree\u2019 and/or \u2018Description\u2019 fields.\u201d\n\nStill, that \u201cdescription\u201d field isn\u2019t easy to find. And why LinkedIn \u2014 which has more than 600 million users \u2014 hasn\u2019t added fields for partially completed degrees is a bit of a mystery, particularly given that so many people drop out.\n\nCynically we will note that LinkedIn makes a lot of its revenue off recruitment services. Before it was acquired by Microsoft, and the companies\u2019 financials were consolidated, 65 percent of LinkedIn\u2019s revenue came from recruitment services. And often the more distinguished the degree, the more people will pay to associate themselves with the ostensible degree holder. (LinkedIn itself strongly encourages loading up one\u2019s profile with education-related details, saying these attract \u201c11x\u201d more profile views.)\n\nA much bigger factor, however, is human nature, argues Stanford professor Jeffrey Pfeffer, a renowned professor at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business who has written extensively about organization theory. Asked if he has reason to think that more students are listing incomplete degrees on LinkedIn \u2014 or even dropping out of school with less compunction, knowing they might \u2014 he points us to numbers published in 2001 by the payroll and benefits managing company ADP.\n\nWhat they show: of 2.6 million background checks that the company performed that year, 44 percent of applicants were discovered to have lied about their work histories, 41 percent lied about their education, and 23 percent falsified credentials or licenses.\n\n\u201cPeople lie about everything all the time,\u201d says Pfeffer. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s any worse now than it was 10 or 20 or 30 years ago.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something recruiters anticipate, he says. He recalls a conversation with a top executive from the search giant Heidrick & Struggles, who Pfeffer had interviewed for one of the many books he has authored. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018So many people make up credentials that we no longer use fudged credentials as a reason to disqualify a candidate.\u2019 He said recruiters will correct what they find wrong with someone\u2019s resume. But he said if they used exaggerated \u2014 even made-up \u2014 credentials as a reason to disqualify people, they would never have enough candidates.\u201d\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s limited menu of options may give more cover to people. But Pfeffer cautions not to assign the company too much blame, no matter its reach. It\u2019s a little like shooting the messenger, he suggests. \u201cSure, LinkedIn could play some role. But they could change the way they operate tomorrow, and people would still find a way to make themselves look more accomplished than they are.\u201d\n\nMaybe so. We\u2019d rather see some changes to find out.", "description": "A couple of years ago, the cofounder and CEO of a blood-testing company was publicly taken to task for implying in articles and professional profiles that he has a PhD when in reality, he\u2019d left a prestigious graduate group three years after enrolling, without a degree.
