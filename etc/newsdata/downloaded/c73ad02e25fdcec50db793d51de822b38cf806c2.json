What fools we were! Have we learned nothing from last year\u2019s non-stop album drop marathon? Well, the answer is no, because Yeezy himself has teased a new release date for his new music: October 25. According to Forbes, the rapper reportedly told attendees of Saturday\u2019s Jesus is King: A Kanye West Experience at George Washington University that the unwashed masses would finally get an official release of some kind on October 25. The reason for the delay? Said West, \u201cI\u2019m making it better for ya\u2019ll.\u201d\n\nThis date should come as no surprise to those of you who hung on Kim Kardashian West\u2019s every tweet back in September, hinting at her husband\u2019s Friday, September 27 album release, then reassuring fans that Jesus Is King would definitely, absolutely, for sure arrive on Sunday, September 29. When both those days came and went without Jesus arriving, October 25 became the new goalpost. That\u2019s the release date for West\u2019s companion IMAX film, also named Jesus Is King, a documentary-style movie made at at James Turrell\u2019s installation art piece Roden Crater in Arizona that features \u201csongs arranged by West in the gospel tradition along with music from his new album.\u201d If he somehow manages to push back both his album release and the premiere of his new film\u2026 well, frankly, we\u2019d just be impressed. Kanye\u2019s not going to do anything Kanye doesn\u2019t want to do, that\u2019s for sure.", "description": "Kanye West told fans at George Washington Universe that his new album Jesus Is King will be released on October 25, almost a month late.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/13-Kanye-West-Coachella.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
