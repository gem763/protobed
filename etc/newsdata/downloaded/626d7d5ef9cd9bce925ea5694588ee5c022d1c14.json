So she killed him, police say.", "language": "en", "text": "Lillian Parks was 87 years old and worried about who would take care of her disabled grandson after she died. So, she told police in Bradenton, Fla., she killed the 30-year-old man she was supposed to protect.\n\nNow a warrant has been issued for the arrest of the elderly woman, who will face second-degree murder charges in the death of her grandson, Joel. Bradenton police spokesman Brian Thiers said that while authorities do not have a timeline, Parks will be taken into custody as soon as she is released from a doctor\u2019s care. He said police will do everything they can to get justice for the victim\u2019s family and friends.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find people now that are going to be the voice for Joel,\u201d Thiers told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to work for him and try to figure out why this happened.\u201d\n\nThe death was discovered Sunday, after Joel Parks\u2019s sister went to check on him and found his body in the apartment he shared with his grandmother in Bradenton, a city of 56,000 people about 13 miles north of Sarasota. A cause of death has not been released; Thiers said Lillian Parks volunteered that she had given her grandson medication with the intent of causing an overdose.\n\nAuthorities have confirmed that the man \u201ccould not function as an adult\u201d and required constant support and care, Thiers said. His father was dead and his mother was estranged, according to the Bradenton Herald. His grandmother, a former nurse who had no criminal record, was his legal guardian. He lived in a group home during the week and with her on weekends.\n\nNeighbors told the Bradenton newspaper that Joel Parks did not have physical disabilities but struggled with mental problems from an accident that happened when he was a baby. They said he often worked at a local convenience store on weekends he spent with his grandmother. He was seen there \u201cin good spirits\u201d on Saturday, the day before his body was found.\n\nThe case is \u201ctragic all around,\u201d Thiers said, noting that detectives feel some sense of sympathy for a person who apparently felt she had no other options.\n\n\u201cBut, again, she took a human life,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t discriminate based on age or race \u2014 anything. We have to look at it from the totality of the circumstances. And, at the end of the day, we have to protect his rights, too.\u201d\n\nBrittany.Shammas@washpost.com\n\nRead more:\n\nA steamy chat distracted an officer when she entered the wrong apartment and killed a man, prosecutors say\n\nAn 11-year-old drove 200 miles alone to live with a man he met on Snapchat, police say\n\nMassachusetts to ban sale of all vaping products for 4 months in toughest state crackdown\n\nAn inmate allegedly confessed to the \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 killing that Steven Avery is in prison for", "description": "A police spokesman called the case \"tragic all around.\"", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm", "Brittany Shammas Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
