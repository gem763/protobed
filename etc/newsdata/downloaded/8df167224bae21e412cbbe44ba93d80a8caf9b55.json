Set in an alternative history in 1985, in which Richard Nixon is still president and the United States won the Vietnam War, it presented a world where masked crusaders were as real and as innately flawed as people\u2014because most of them were ordinary people. The adventures of its \u201cheroes\u201d (the anarchic Rorschach, the grandiose Ozymandias, the actually superpowered Doctor Manhattan) played out against the backdrop of an America stalking toward an apocalyptic conflict with the Soviet Union.\n\nLindelof, the creator of Lost and The Leftovers, has confessed that he agonized over whether to take on the task of adapting Watchmen. While he\u2019d been a fan of the source material since he was a child, as he wrote in an impassioned Instagram manifesto more than a year ago, he was well aware that Moore, its original writer, was fundamentally opposed to adaptations of the story outside of the medium in which it was born. Lindelof\u2019s compromise was that he would leave the story of Watchmen be, while using it as a jumping-off point for a story set several decades later in the same universe. \u201cThe tone will be fresh and nasty and electric and absurd,\u201d he wrote. Most crucial of all was that it \u201cbe contemporary.\u201d\n\nRead: The movie review: \u201cWatchmen\u201d\n\nWhat Lindelof didn\u2019t mention in his letter was the most striking thing he\u2019s done with Watchmen, which is reorient this canonical story around a century of American racism. The first episode of Watchmen begins with a depiction of the 1921 Tulsa massacre (in which a prosperous black community was decimated by racist mob attacks) and ends with a body hanging from a tree. Rorschach is no longer a hero but the motif of a white-supremacist terrorist movement whose members wear ghostly white masks adorned with amorphous inkblots. Their goal, they state in a video released to the police, is to turn the streets of Tulsa \u201cinto gutters overflowing with liberal tears.\u201d They call themselves the Seventh Kavalry. As the camera pans out on the mask-wearing member who\u2019s speaking, it reveals that he\u2019s not wearing a full-body costume, but an ordinary plaid shirt.\n\nThe illicit power that masks and anonymity offer their wearers is a subject that Watchmen returns to again and again. Without the burden of having their real selves exposed, the characters can be insulated from the consequences of the things they do and the ideas they espouse. The central character in the new series is Angela Abar (played magnificently by Regina King), a former cop who \u201cretired\u201d from the force after the White Night, a synchronized Kavalry attack on Tulsa police and their families that killed Angela\u2019s partner and his wife. After that event, police were allowed to cover their faces to disguise their identity. Angela, going a beat further, started moonlighting as a hero called Sister Night, supporting the cops as a costumed vigilante while keeping her real identity secret to protect her family. Her motives are sincere, the show suggests, but they\u2019re not simple. \u201cPeople who wear masks are driven by trauma,\u201d the Watchmen member turned FBI agent Laurie Blake (Jean Smart) tells her. \u201cThey\u2019re obsessed with justice because of some injustice they suffered.\u201d", "description": "The new HBO series is a stunning, timely departure from its graphic-novel origins.", "authors": ["Sophie Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/b4f21495b7031f862cb735a7d25aed905e0e052e1ed8c8ebd21adb8ada23fea9cf71803fb7ea22c97f00025e8261abcb/facebook.jpg?1571671032", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
