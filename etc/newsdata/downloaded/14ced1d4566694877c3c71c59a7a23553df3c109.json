And that may set you up for poor choices in your eating habits, self-care and finances.\n\nA new study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology asked elite endurance athletes to overtrain for three out of nine weeks, and compared them to a group who did a normal 9-week training program.\n\nNot only did those overworked athletes perform worse on a cycling test administered at the end of the overtraining, MRIs of their brains during behavioral tasks showed more fatigue in the cognitive control part of the brain system.\n\n\"Cognitive control in this situation is the capacity to maintain exercise despite things like muscle pain,\" said study author Bastien Blain, a research associate at University College London. \"And what we found is there is an intellectual component involved in exercising and it has a finite capacity. You cannot use it forever.\"\n\nIn other words, your brain will burn out and affect your body's ability to exercise. But that's not all. Overworking that part of the brain also reduced the athletes' abilities to resist temptation of an immediate reward.\n\nRead More", "description": "Levels of exercise may impact our brain's control over our impulses, possibly leading to poor choices in how we eat, manage our finances and handle self-care, studies show.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170425174611-crossfit-tease-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
