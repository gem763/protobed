The Colombia-born Dunoyer family is one of them, but the price of their participation has been steep: Newsweek reports that they're now living in fear of being targeted by ICE.\n\nThe family explained in the series that they fled to the U.S. in 2002 and applied for asylum through San Diego's immigration system because their father Roberto's life was being threatened by drug traffickers. (The series even stated that guerillas in Colombia were still sending Roberto threats at the time the documentary was made.) But in 2008 a judge denied their asylum request. After the Netflix series aired, Roberto was picked up by authorities in the parking lot of his job and he was deported, the family tells Newsweek. Now, his sons Camilo and Pablo, who are 18 and 21, have dropped out of school and are living in separate hideaway locations. Camilo told Newsweek, \"I don't feel safe anywhere. [...] I barely leave the house I'm in.\"\n\n\n\nThe Dunoyer family's plight highlights an issue in documentary filmmaking: what happens when a project puts its subjects at risk? In Living Undocumented, Roberto's background story of narrowly escaping murderous drug traffickers heightens the drama and suspense of the series. But for the Dunoyer family, that's their reality.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Taylor Hosking on Twitter and Instagram .", "description": "A Colombian family told Newsweek that, since the series aired, their father has been deported and their two sons have left school to go into hiding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da73e49d9e6360009ffcec2/lede/1571243282223-Living_Undocumented_S01E02_4m17s6171f_NEW-5.jpeg?crop=0.8889xw:0.9986xh;0.0414xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
