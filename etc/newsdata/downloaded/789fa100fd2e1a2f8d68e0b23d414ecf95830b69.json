Running on Saturday afternoons from 26 October, the hour-long show will be presented by composer Jessica Curry, who won a Bafta for her work with UK studio The Chinese Room and created and presented Classic FM\u2019s video game music programme, High Score.\n\n\u201c[BBC presenter and journalist] Tom Service and his producer Brian Jackson came to interview me for Radio 3 at Chinese Room a couple of years ago, and we all really hit it off,\u201d said Curry. \u201cTom\u2019s an avid gamer and there was a definite feeling of excitement about the gaming scene and the music that\u2019s being composed for games.\n\n\u201cLots of people think that it\u2019s all battle music and aggression. The show will prove that that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Mind-blowing music\u2019 \u2026 Jessica Curry.

The Distant Worlds concert, which features compositions from Japanese role-playing game Final Fantasy, has been touring the world for more than a decade, while video-game-themed symphony concerts devoted to games such as Legend of Zelda, Mass Effect and Halo have taken place at the world\u2019s major classical venues, including the Royal Albert Hall in London and Sydney Opera House. Meanwhile, a new market for vinyl video game soundtrack albums has grown up with specialist labels iam8bit and Data Discs producing lavishly packaged records for new and retro games.\n\nFor fans, the appeal of the music is often nostalgic and related to their love of the games, but Curry says video game soundtracks are attracting a wider interest for their own qualities. \u201cI believe we\u2019re entering a golden age of games music,\u201d said Curry. \u201cThe sheer breadth of soundtracks this year has been mind-blowing, and the quality and diversity of games music is on the rise. At the moment, I am in love with Lena Raine\u2019s music for Celeste \u2013 it has such a beautiful nod to nostalgia but is also completely now. All of Grant Kirkhope\u2019s music is stunning, and I have Olivier Deriviere\u2019s incredible score for 11-11 Memories Retold on repeat.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Video Games Live at Hammersmith Apollo, London, in 2006.

Speaking to the Guardian last year, composer Winifred Phillips said: \u201cGames are structured so that there are long expanses where there is no dialogue. And music that you create for those sequences, you have the opportunity to really develop musical ideas.\u201d\n\nCurry also points out that, as game music needs to be able to fill long periods of time while the player explores at their own pace, it can be more ambient and unintrusive \u2013 making it perfect to listen to while doing other things or relaxing. \u201cTodd Baker\u2019s music for Monument Valley always goes on when I\u2019m stressed and need to chill out,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile symphonic scores are flourishing, experimental electronic soundtracks are also gaining wider recognition. \u201cIf you look at Sayonara Wild Hearts, that game is packed full of lush electronica. Berlinist\u2019s score for GRIS was a gorgeous mix of more traditional game music and epic electronic dreaminess. Chipzel is tearing the house down with her chip-tune bangers.\u201d\n\nWhile many video game soundtracks are intended as a discrete compositions, there has been a rise in \u201cprocedural\u201d scores, which adapt to the actions of the player, rising in tempo and urgency in action set pieces and becoming more ambient during exploration. Experimental group 65daysofstatic produced over two hours of modular electronic music for the space adventure No Man\u2019s Sky, while Matt Boch, associate arts professor at NYU Game Center, created a percussive interactive jazz soundscape for beat-\u2019em-up game, Ape Out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Electronic adventurers \u2026 65daysofstatic\n\n\u201cNostalgia isn\u2019t going anywhere; the AAAs will stick with the traditional filmic orchestral model,\u201d said Curry. \u201cBut the success of Ape Out means that the use of procedural music is going to keep growing.\u201d\n\nShe believes an influx of new talent, training specifically as video game composers, will also challenge the status quo.\n\n\u201cLots of us older composers were trained in film and television and adapted our compositional approach, but the young guns are digital natives and grew up wanting to compose specifically for games. They have a very intuitive understanding of interactive media and that\u2019s one of the reasons that music for games is getting better and better. It\u2019s been exciting to see more women breaking through, as traditionally it\u2019s been very male, and those different voices have inevitably led to new and exciting approaches.\u201d\n\nCurry says her programme will seek to showcase the variety in the medium, as well as explore how game scores are written.\n\n\u201cEach week we play a classic track \u2013 one that I feel has stood the test of time \u2013 as well as a new release and an interview with a games composer, lifting the lid on what it takes to write music for games. For the rest of the show I will be unashamedly partisan and just play tracks that I absolutely love.\u201d\n\nCurry sees the medium evolving further as its profile increases. \u201cMore bands will write music for games,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd with an increase in tours and performances of their work, game composers are going to become stars in their own right.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sound of Gaming is on Radio 3 every Saturday for six weeks from 26 October. The programme will also be available on BBC Sounds.", "description": "Presenter Jessica Curry says she wants to prove it\u2019s not all about soundtracking battle scenes \u2013 there are plenty of beautiful, relaxing sounds, too", "authors": ["Keith Stuart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f7483a81e824ca2e0490a29c7b8a400a83e3859/293_197_664_398/master/664.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=90e3a71d569ad0c7e475a64eb2bbfe07", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
