Because I have a Google machine and access to the research.\u201d Smith then went on to read from a study that shows that vaping has a \u201cnegative impact on air quality\u201d and there are \u201cno long term studies to back up claims\u201d that vapor is less harmful than conventional cigarette smoke.\n\nAfter Abboud objected, insisting that the American Cancer Association says vaping is on a lower risk spectrum than cigarettes, Smith noted that the American Lung Association finds that \u201ce-cigarettes are not safe and can cause irreversible lung damage and lung disease.\u201d\n\nSmith continued to pepper the lobbyist with questions on the dangers of vaping, asking him if vaping can cause cancer. When Abboud said it is still unclear, Smith read from studies that show e-cigarettes contain cancer-causing substances before questioning whether the vaping industry is being dishonest with its consumers.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at individual studies,\u201d Abboud retorted, prompting Smith to utter: \u201cOh, dear.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Smith repeatedly pressed the vaping advocate on whether or not the industry marketed flavored e-cigs to kids. After Abboud said some vapes had been \u201cmarketed in inappropriate ways\u201d in the past, Smith demanded a direct yes or no answer.\n\n\u201cI asked, were they marketing to children, yes or no?\u201d Smith declared.\n\n\u201cI think, Shep, I said yes, in the past that was in fact happening,\u201d Abboud replied. \u201cThat\u2019s why we came out with marketing standards for the industry in 2017 and hand-delivered them to Commissioner Gottlieb in January of 2018 and implored him to enforce on marketing standards even more. And then we told our industry this is what you need to do.\u201d\n\nSmith, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied with this answer and specifically asked the lobbyist: \u201cWeren\u2019t the flavors marketed to kids? Were they or not? Flavors, bubblegum, the rest. Even mint. Weren\u2019t they for kids?\u201d\n\nAbboud, however, confusingly said \u201cthat\u2019s not what the science says,\u201d causing Smith to clarify that he\u2019s talking about all the fruity and sweet flavors and whether they were marketing to kids who never smoked before rather than to adults who were trying to quit smoking.\n\n\u201cThe answer to that is you\u2019re marketing to adults, there\u2019s no question about that,\u201d Abboud responded.\n\n\u201cThere is a question about it, with respect,\u201d Smith snapped back. \u201cThere is a great question about it. The problem is with children.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe have a whole generation of kids who realized smoking is nasty and I\u2019m not going to do it and now they are running around in schools all over the country in bathrooms where the teachers can\u2019t catch them, they are getting addicted to nicotine. Do you have a problem being in an industry that addicts children to nicotine?\u201d\n\nSmith would go on and grill Abboud for a while longer, eventually telling the lobbyist that it is \u201cunfortunate\u201d that his industry has addicted millions of kids to nicotine.", "description": "\u201cWeren\u2019t the flavors marketed to kids?
