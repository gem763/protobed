After having proceeded through the system properly and lawfully, they have a legal right to remain anonymous,\u201d said lawyer Mark Zaid in an email statement to Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cIn light of their intelligence community status and the heightened partisanship, revealing their identities, correctly or falsely, places those individuals and their families at risk of harm and harassment,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans are becoming increasingly outraged at the prospect of Democrats conducting an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d in secret. Democrats have not taken an official vote in the House to begin an official impeachment inquiry, which would trigger certain rights for Republican lawmakers, and have refused to release the transcripts of witnesses who have recently testified to Congress as part of the inquiry.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Monday that House Democrats are weighing \u201cextraordinary steps\u201d to mask the identity of a CIA official who filed a whistleblower complaint against Trump, prompting their so-called impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats are considering having the official testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual\u2019s appearance and voice, or a \u201cstaff-only\u201d session that would prevent lawmakers from attending and asking questions, according to the Post.\n\n\u201c[House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA)] does not want to burn his identity,\u201d a senior congressional official told the paper.\n\nSchiff denies knowing the whistleblower\u2019s identity, but he was forced to admit the whistleblower contacted his committee before making his complaint against Trump.\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that the CIA official went to the House Intelligence Committee and spoke with a Schiff aide, who then passed on the allegations to Schiff and instructed the official to file a whistleblower complaint with the inspector general.\n\nFred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst and chief of staff of the National Security Council, said lawmakers need to be able to question the CIA official to assess him, his allegations, and his motivations, particularly given reports the whistleblower had a prior working relationship with Democrats.\n\n\u201cSchiff\u2019s efforts to prevent an in-person, closed door @HouseIntelComm hearing with the [whistleblower] looks like he wants to hide the WB\u2019s partisan motivations for filing his complaint,\u201d he added.\n\n7/ Schiff's efforts to prevent an in-person, closed door\n\n@HouseIntelComm hearing with the WB looks like he wants to hide the WB's partisan motivations for filing his complaint. \u2014 Fred Fleitz (@FredFleitz) October 8, 2019\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Sunday said if House Democrats advance articles of impeachment, he will \u201cmake sure\u201d the officials who filed whistleblower complaints face public questioning.\n\n\u201cIf the whistleblower\u2019s allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it\u2019s imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public, under oath, and cross-examined,\u201d he said on Fox News Sunday Morning Futures.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "None of the whistleblowers who have come forward with allegations against President Trump intend to reveal their identities.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/mark-zaid-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
