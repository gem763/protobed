CEO Robert Iger has stepped down from Apple\u2019s board of directors as the two companies prepare to launch competing video streaming services aimed at market leader Netflix.\n\nApple disclosed Iger\u2019s departure in a regulatory filing Friday, but his resignation became effective Tuesday. That\u2019s the same day that Apple announced its long-awaited video streaming service will debut Nov. 1 and cost only $5 per month, less than half the price of Netflix\u2019s most popular plan.\n\nDisney is gearing up to launch a video streaming service for $7 per month later in November.\n\nThe dueling services raised potential conflicts of interest that apparently prompted Iger to step down after spending nearly eight years on Apple\u2019s board.\n\nApple praised Iger as an \u201cexemplary\u201d board member and one of its \u201cmost trusted business partners\u201d in a statement.\n\nIger responded in kind. \u201cApple is one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, known for the quality and integrity of its products and its people, and I am forever grateful to have served as a member of the company\u2019s board,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nIger, 68, became intertwined with Apple in 2006 when he negotiated a $7.4 billion deal to buy computer animation studio Pixar, a company run by Steve Jobs. That made the Apple co-founder Disney\u2019s largest shareholder, and Jobs took a seat on Disney\u2019s board, which he held until his death in 2011.\n\nNow both companies are taking aim at the rapidly growing video streaming market - a field that Netflix pioneered along the way to amassing more than 150 million subscribers worldwide. But the intensifying competition could slow Netflix\u2019s growth, a threat that came into sharper focus earlier this summer when the company disclosed its first quarterly decline in U.S. subscribers since 2011.\n\nWithout elaborating, Apple said its relationship with Iger and Disney will continue \u201cfar into the future.\u201d\n\nThe Cupertino, California, company didn\u2019t say whether it intends to replace Iger on what is now a seven-member board.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Walt Disney Co.
