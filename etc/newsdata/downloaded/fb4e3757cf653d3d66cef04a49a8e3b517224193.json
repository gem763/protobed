That follows a 13.1% tumble last week, and brings the two-week selloff from the Sept. 6 record close of $169.86 to 35.6%.\n\nThis week\u2019s selloff was highlighted by Wednesday\u2019s 13.7% plunge, after Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -0.69% said it will start giving away its Xfinity Flex streaming-media player for free to those who subscribe to the cable operator\u2019s internet-only plans.\n\nAnd last Tuesday, Roku shares tumbled 10.5% after Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.46% unveiled the price for its Apple TV+ service that was half of what was expected.\n\nThis week\u2019s decline is headed for the biggest since Roku went public in September 2017, surpassing the 24.1% tumble during the week ending Nov. 9, 2018. Friday\u2019s selloff is the second-biggest one-day drop in the stock\u2019s public history, only behind the 22.3% fall on Nov. 8, 2018 after the company\u2019s reported disappointing quarterly results.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nOn Friday, Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak sent a note to clients titled, \u201cIs Roku Broku?,\u201d as he started coverage of Roku with a sell rating and stock price target of $60, which is 45% below current levels.\n\nWlodarczak said that Roku management \u201cdeserves a lot of credit\u201d for creating a pure-play over-the-top (OTT) investment in the move away from traditional cable. But despite the recent pullback in the stock, he believes it remains \u201cdramatically overvalued\u201d following a near than four-fold run up (up 294%) this year.\n\n\u201cWe see dramatically more competition emerging that will likely drive the cost of OTT devices to zero and put material pressure on advertising revenue splits, highlighted by Comcast\u2019s recent moves with its free Xfinity Flex product that is likely to be copied by other distributors,\u201d Wlodarczak wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cWhile Roku management deserves credit for the asset they have created, everyone has realized the living room is too important and the big boys...with massive leverage are likely to make Roku growth much more difficult,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, most analysts on Wall Street remain bullish, as the average rating of the 17 analysts surveyed by FactSet is the equivalent of \u201coverweight,\u201d and the average price target of $130.69 is about 20% above current levels.\n\nFactSet analyst coverage\n\nOn Friday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein affirmed the outperform rating he\u2019s had on Roku for the past 14 months, while raising his price target to $155 from $120, as he remains upbeat on international expansion plans and believes Roku has a leg up on its competition.\n\nHelfstein said Roku\u2019s U.S. strategy playbook should allow for \u201cfast international market share,\u201d and its subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) subscriptions will be a \u201cclear tailwind,\u201d as many new services play catch-up in a crowded market.\n\nOn Thursday, Roku unveiled new streaming devices, including new offerings for Canada and the United Kingdom, and introduced a new Roku Express that is 10% smaller and costs less than the older model.\n\n\u201cWe estimate Apple+, Disney+ and a mix of others (notably HBO Max) will provide $21/share in combined upside,\u201d Helfstein wrote in a note to clients. \u201cWe see Roku \u2018cashing\u2019 in on their U.S. market penetration (~33%), promoting and selling SVOD subscriptions directly, with competition from new entrants...as being too late.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that the stock is still \u201cexpensive,\u201d but given the current growth and bullish secular outlook, he sees the stock moving higher from current levels.\n\nThe stock is still up 4.2% over the past three months, while Comcast shares have gained 6.8%, Apple\u2019s stock has advanced 10.1% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.49% has tacked on 1.6%.", "description": "Shares of Roku Inc. plunged Friday, putting them on track for their worst-ever weekly performance, as investors continued to express concern over increasing...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR735_Roku_0_ZG_20190920101801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
