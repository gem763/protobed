By the late innings, this game was a zombie slasher meets son of the Hindenburg as closer Daniel Hudson escaped a bases-loaded, eighth-inning jam by getting Matt Carpenter to ground out. In the end, Tanner Rainey, Sean Doolittle and Hudson held the fort for the last dozen outs \u2014 a plot twist beyond comprehension.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is no gift like an unexpected gift, no joy like the jubilation when you anticipated sadness.\n\n\u201cSome of the best things come from the unexpected moments,\u201d Nats postseason hero Howie Kendrick said this week.\n\nThere is no shock like the discovery that a desperate moment \u2014 May 23 for these Nats \u2014 that felt like the end of an era of success was really a time of transformation under duress into something better, richer and more satisfying than you had imagined possible.\n\nJust when it felt like the best era of Washington baseball since 1924 to 1933 was swirling down the drain, with the Nats\u2019 record at 19-31, suddenly everything that seemed wrong began to go right. The struggling and lame \u2014 Trea Turner, Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto \u2014 came back from the injured list and gradually got hot.\n\nAD\n\nThe team landed a Baby Shark named Gerardo Parra on a one-ounce test line \u2014 picked up for free, with the San Francisco Giants still paying his salary. And the team that knows how to put the huge, ugly \u201cE\u201d in \u201celimination game\u201d suddenly became the first team in major league history to win two elimination games in the same October after trailing by three or more runs.\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals \u2014 once known as the \u201cNatinals\u201d on their own jerseys, the same team that got knocked out of the first round of the playoffs four times \u2014 celebrated the patriarch of D.C. baseball by claiming the pennant on Ted Lerner\u2019s 94th birthday. His team knows what it has given him. And he understands what he has given to this city for the first time in 86 years.\n\nThe Nats go to the World Series as just what they love to be \u2014 disregarded, constantly underdogs. They\u2019ll face an American League champion, either the Houston Astros or New York Yankees, that will be regarded as much their superior. But the Nats are certain in their baseball guts that this will be darn close to a toss-up World Series.\n\nAD\n\nGood pitching beats good hitting \u2014 that\u2019s the thesis for a supposed long-shot Nats World Series win. Patrick Corbin fanned a dozen Cardinals and got the win Tuesday night, although he ran out of gas after five innings.\n\nAD\n\nTwo points, both apparent in Game 4, should be made about these Nats \u2014 akin to noting that lightning can not only electrocute you but also knock down trees on your head.\n\nIn their past 123 games, only the Yankees have scored more runs per game. The Nats\u2019 lineup, in their current state of perfect health, is one of the deepest and most multifaceted in the majors.\n\nGame 4\u2019s seven-run first inning epitomized the Nats\u2019 versatile attack \u2014 one that\u2019s defiantly out of step with the home-run-or-whiff model of this era. Yes, the Nats hit homers \u2014 231, but that was only 13th best this year. Within the NL, they are first in on-base percentage, tied for first in batting average and second in fewest strikeouts. They also tied for the league lead in steals. To many, all of this is heresy. But it has worked, with a master-class example in the first inning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nats scored seven runs without hitting a ball farther than 275 feet in the air. They slapped a single (Turner) and double (Soto) to the opposite field. A power hitter (Rendon) put the first pitch he saw in play because he knew it could produce a sacrifice fly. Two players merely put the ball in play: Ryan Zimmerman sharply and Victor Robles with a popup. The Cards made an error on the first and completely missed the second as it fell between three of them. Yan Gomes and Turner followed with two-run singles drilled through the left side of the infield. Between them, Corbin put down a perfect sacrifice bunt.\n\nIt was, frankly, nothing less than baseball high art: The first 10 hitters of a game with the pennant on the line executed perfectly.\n\nDakota Hudson, the Cards\u2019 wins leader, left having gotten one \u2014 o-n-e \u2014 out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe other Nats weapon that has brought them to this city-delighting pennant is depth. In World Series games played in the AL city, the Nats will be able to pick a bat off their loaded bench to be the designated hitter \u2014 perhaps switch-hitting Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera (91 RBI), or Brian Dozier or Matt Adams (20 homers each). There might even be a spot for Parra \u2014 who got a hit, to universal delight, in the pennant clincher.\n\nIn the glee that now sweeps over Washington, don\u2019t bet the house on the Nats against the 107-win Astros or 103-win Yanks. But it might be worth taking out a second mortgage on your gardening shed.\n\nWhatever ills or joys are still to come, Tuesday night was the best baseball victory in D.C. since 1933, another era when America seemed chest-deep in serious problems. In October 2019, Washington is united behind one flag and one purpose \u2014 symbolized by those silly Baby Shark bandannas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nats are also a team for their place and time. They exalt in their diversity with eight key players, and team leaders, from Venezuela, Brazil and the Dominican Republic. Their manager, Dave Martinez, told his Latin teammates when he arrived in the minors in 1983, \u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t speak Spanish.\u201d\n\nNow, of course, he does. But he has also learned a lot about another language that he struggled with when he took the job last year: He\u2019s now closer to fluent in \u201cbullpen.\u201d He has learned at least four words \u2014 Doolittle, Hudson, Rainey and Rodney. And he used that vocabulary well in Game 4, getting a scoreless inning from Rainey in the sixth. Doolittle blanked the Cards in the seventh, and Daniel Hudson completed a scary eighth before a perfect ninth to end it.\n\nAll of these factors are part of the explanation of why the Nats\u2019 NL championship is neither magic nor fluke. It is excellent, but some of it hides in plain sight.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis, however, is also a team with a fire deep inside it that it seldom fully articulates. This is a band of old men without rings.\n\nOnly one National, reliever Hunter Strickland, has played for a World Series winner. After Game 2, Zimmerman and Max Scherzer, both 35, referred to themselves, and the 16 other Nats on this playoff roster who are past their 30th birthdays, as \u201cLos Viejos\u201d \u2014 the Old Men.\n\nFor Washington, it has seemed as if it took a baseball eternity to win a pennant. But to three-quarters of these Nationals, winning the NLCS may mean more than just the D.C. joyride of a visit to the World Series.\n\nTo them, grabbing a pennant, marvelous as that is for their city and its fans, is probably \u2014 though none will say it \u2014 a stepping stone to their collective dream of rings.\n\nAD\n\nIf you think Game 4 was hard as that 7-0 lead dwindled to 7-4, and that those comebacks in elimination games against the Milwaukee Brewers and Los Angeles Dodgers were harrowing, be forewarned. What these old men, plus a few gifted youngsters, with their dugout dancing and hugging, really have in mind, starting next Tuesday, will be even more challenging. Perhaps even impossible.\n\nAD\n\nBut, as we have learned, the prize that is least expected, the goal that seems almost impossible, is also the most thrilling.\n\nPop the corks. Raise the pennant. But know one thing: The Nationals don\u2019t think their season has reached its peak.", "description": "This unexpected joyride of a season could hold more promise yet.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qSt-_gDOQWlS7lpiGV4N8ckqOyU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RGCJ5QXPWAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
