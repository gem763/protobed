USA TODAY\n\nRunning from zombies for 10 years must be exhausting.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why \u201cZombieland: Double Tap\u201d (\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of five; rated R; in theaters nationwide Friday) seems so tired. Director Ruben Fleischer and the heart of the cast of 2009\u2019s \u201cZombieland\u201d return, but the goofy magic of the original is in short supply. There are some funny bits and a welcome shot of new blood, but there\u2019s not a lot of overwhelming evidence for this movie\u2019s need to exist.\n\nColumbus (Jessie Eisenberg) begins the movie by welcoming everyone back. He explains what\u2019s been going on for the last 10 years. He\u2019s in a relationship with Wichita (Emma Stone), while Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) acts as kind of a surrogate father to Wichita\u2019s sister, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), although she\u2019s not as enthusiastic about that as he is.\n\nThey classify zombies in three different ways now, depending on the abilities of that particular walking dead. Fair enough \u2013 the slow-moving dumb ones are called \u201cHomers,\u201d after Homer Simpson \u2013 but it never really amounts to much in terms of the story, with the exception of a more-evolved type of zombie that\u2019s harder to kill.\n\nAbigail Breslin (left) and Emma Stone star in \"Zombieland: Double Tap.\" (Photo: Jessica Miglio)\n\nThe four take up residence in the White House, where Donald Trump jokes go untold. (There is one about William Howard Taft, however, if you're waiting for that.)\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a good life, Columbus tells us. But an ill-advised question sets Wichita and Little Rock on a different path for a time, where they meet Berkeley (Avan Jogia), a hippie pacifist \u2013 not exactly what you want in a world full of zombies, but Little Rock is desperate to meet someone her own age, so she\u2019s willing to overlook it.\n\nColumbus and Tallahassee, meanwhile, meet Madison (Zoey Deutch), an airhead who is without question the most-welcome addition to the cast and the best thing about the movie. She brings the same zany energy that was so pervasive in the first film \u2013 the go-for-broke willingness to do anything for a laugh.\n\nThe group, in varying combinations, will travel to Graceland and then to a commune called Babylon. In Memphis they meet Nevada (Rosario Dawson), a tough survivor and someone for whom Tallahassee can at least temporarily drop his tough-guy act.\n\nWoody Harrelson and Rosario Dawson star in \"Zombieland: Double Tap.\" (Photo: Jessica Miglio)\n\nThere\u2019s a funny, ambitious bit in Memphis that\u2019s best left unspoiled, but it makes you long for more of this kind of inventiveness. And there\u2019s a post-credits cameo that seems like an almost desperate attempt to reclaim one of the best bits in the original film. Without saying too much, an earlier reference is genuinely funny. The post-credits scene is too much.\n\nThis is a really great cast, but it\u2019s just impossible to recapture the antic feel of the first film in a sequel. In the original, the zombies were new, and part of the fun was the group of survivors wrapping their heads around the fact that the dead were rising and, while they\u2019re at it, eating people. Once they did that, they had to adapt and learn how to survive.\n\nNow they know how, and they seem almost bored with it. They\u2019ve lived this long by becoming really good at killing zombies \u2013 so good that, with a few exceptions, there\u2019s never really any danger. That edge, that tension, was a big part of what made \u201cZombieland\u201d so funny. \u201cZombieland: Double Tap\u201d could have used a lot more of it.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/18/zombieland-emma-stone-double-tap-review-magic-is-missing/4012867002/", "description": "Woody Harrelson and the original cast return in 'Zombieland: Double Tap,' the sequel to the 2009 hit, but the manic energy of the first film does not.", "authors": ["Bill Goodykoontz", "Published A.M.
