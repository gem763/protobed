Journalists at The Desert Sun in Palm Springs began the project in late 2016 to examine the polluted New River, which flows from Mexicali across the border into the United States, and ultimately uncovered widespread pollution in the region\u2019s air and water. Their research intersected with the digital journalism power of USA TODAY NETWORK to create new forms of storytelling.\n\nThe research for \"Poisoned Cities\" involved analysis that linked government records from Mexico and the United States, encompassing years of work. The investigation of the New River found that the pollution \u2014 in the water, air, and all around the region \u2014 is linked to the rise of industry in Mexicali, where factories manufacture products that supply Mexico and the United States. The pollution is linked to high rates of respiratory illnesses and deaths, but the system of regulation in Mexicali does little to regulate factories or punish polluters.\n\nTo highlight the different aspects of reporting, the \u201cPoisoned Cities\u201d project is broken down into four segments: \u201cWhere air can kill,\u201d \u201cAn industrial takeover,\u201d \u201cA toxic river\u201d and \u201cA dumping ground.\u201d The findings are being shared with an innovative approach to audience navigation based on options for time \u2013 one minute, five minutes, or full article \u2013 and catered by media preference including videos, interactive graphics, photography and 360/virtual reality. This new digital design allows for a matrix of experiences to bring the problems at the border into focus.\n\n\u201cThis project is border focused, but universal in human toll and drama,\u201d said Greg Burton, who was executive editor of The Desert Sun when \u201cPoisoned Cities\u201d began and now is the executive editor of The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com. \u201cI am so proud of the collaborative effort by teams from The Desert Sun, The Arizona Republic, and USA TODAY NETWORK to shed light on this issue that is affecting so many lives.\u201d\n\n\"This is a large, multifaceted project, and we wanted to allow our audience to engage with the content in different ways and of their choice. This was important to us in sharing this compelling and complex story most effectively,\u201d said Reid Williams, senior director, USA TODAY NETWORK Storytelling Studio.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Poisoned Cities\u2019 investigation exemplifies USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s core goals of investing in investigations and pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling\u201d,\u201d said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, president, USA TODAY NETWORK and publisher, USA TODAY. \u201cThe project is the culmination of truly fantastic journalism.\u201d\n\nTo read more about Poisoned Cities, visit: https://www.desertsun.com/poisoned-cities/\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2018/12/05/usa-today-networks-poisoned-cities-deadly-border-investigation-uncovers-pattern-unchecked-pollution/2212802002/", "description": "Unprecedented investigation of pollution on the border is brought to life in a new digital design", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published A.M.
