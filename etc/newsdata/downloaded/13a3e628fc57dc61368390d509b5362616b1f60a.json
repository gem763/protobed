US to send troops and machines to guard Syrian oil interests, after having vowed to \u2018withdraw\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "US Defense Secretary Mark Esper has confirmed that US troops are being relocated to Syria\u2019s oil regions and more \u201cmechanized forces\u201d are coming, despite previous pledges to pull out.\n\nJust weeks ago, President Donald Trump pompously declared it was \u201ctime to bring our soldiers back home\u201d as he announced that American forces would withdraw from Syria in the face of the then-looming Turkish offensive targeting Kurdish-led militias \u2013 Washington\u2019s long-time allies in the fight against Islamic State (IS, former ISIS/ISIL) terrorists.\n\nThen, he suddenly changed his mind and said that certain troops will stay, supposedly to prevent the Syrian oil fields falling into the hands of potentially resurgent terrorists that escaped Kurdish prisons in the turmoil accompanying the Turkish operation.\n\nAlso on rt.com Coming back to another warzone: US troops leaving Syria will find \u2018home\u2019 in\u2026 western Iraq\n\nNow it turns out that the US will send even more troops to the area, to ensure that the oil is \u201ctotally secure.\u201d On Friday, Esper told other NATO defense ministers in Brussels that the US is \u201ctaking some actions ... to strengthen our position at Deir Ezzor, to ensure that we can deny ISIS access to the oil fields.\u201d\n\nHe also added that the American contingent in the area would now \u201cinclude some mechanized forces.\u201d While Esper did not provide any more details on the issue, some media reports suggest that some Abrams tanks might be deployed to the area. The exact number of troops to be sent on this new mission is also still unknown.\n\nDespite all these fluctuations in the US\u2019s Syria strategy, Esper insists \u201cthe mission remains unchanged.\u201d \u201cThe mission in Syria remains what the mission in Syria began,\u201d he said, noting it\u2019s all about defeating IS.\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump\u2019s Syria \u2018oil gambit\u2019 is a crime, and what may be worse \u2013 a mistake\n\nThis directly contradicts Trump's previous statements, on multiple occasions, that IS has been largely or entirely defeated, that the captured terrorists remain in prison and that the US mission was only supposed to last for a few months, but ended up stretching to years in an \"endless war\" he\u2019s wanted to end.\n\nSyria has previously condemned any US troop presence on its territory as an illegal foreign invasion, no different than that of IS. While the remaining scattered IS militants seem unlikely to take or even threaten an oil field, the presence of US troops will prevent the Syrian people from using it to rebuild.\n\nLike this story?
