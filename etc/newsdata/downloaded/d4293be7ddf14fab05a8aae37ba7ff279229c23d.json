We are in absolutely uncharted parliamentary territory here. There are roughly half of the members of parliaments about 300, 350 who have looked at what it means to leave the European Union without a deal and really don't like what they see. They've also seen the deal that the Prime Minister has brought back from Brussels and, really,it doesn't suit anybody. There will be a delay that leads everything on the table. We can still have a No Deal, very very messy exit. The Prime Minister could still get his way or this could even go back to the people either through a general election or less likely a people's vote second referendum.\"Hundreds of thousands of people marched in London over weekend for a second referendum on leaving the EU, which would take around 22 weeks to organise, if pursued.In the meantime, Johnson is continuing to push for an on-time Brexit.\"He still believes that this is the best he's going to get from Europe. He is probably right in that and that because of the boredom in the nation. He will be able to force it through.He's going to make the meaningful vote now a legislative votes, which he hopes will be enough to win over enough of the waverers to give him victory. It probably won't be the 31st. It's not even enough time in Europe for them to conduct the appropriate scrutiny.\"With just ten days left until the deadline, the government hopes to push through with a vote this week.But observers say breaking the Brexit impasse won't be likely by that time.Oh Soo-young, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
