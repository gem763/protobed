(AP) - A judge cleared the way Tuesday for OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma to stay in business while it pursues bankruptcy protection and settlement of more than 2,600 lawsuits filed against it in a reckoning over the opioid crisis.\n\nAt the first court hearing since the Chapter 11 filing late Sunday, Purdue lawyers secured permission for the multibillion-dollar company based in Stamford, Connecticut, to maintain business as usual - paying employees and vendors, supplying pills to distributors, and keeping current on taxes and insurance.\n\nThe continued viability of Purdue is a key component of the company\u2019s settlement offer, which could be worth up to $12 billion over time.\n\nUnder the proposal, backed by about half the states, the Sackler family, which owns Purdue, would turn the company, its assets and more than $1 billion in cash reserves over to a trust controlled by the very entities suing it.\n\nThe Sacklers have also agreed to pay a minimum of $3 billion of their own money to the settlement over seven years, as well as up to $1.5 billion more in proceeds from the planned sale of their non-U.S. pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\u201cThis is a highly unusual case in that the debtors have pledged to turn over their business to the claimants,\u201d U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said. \u201cAll of the claimants, in essence, have the same interest in maximizing the value of the business and avoiding immediate and irreparable harm.\u201d\n\nJoe Rice, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, estimated it could be more than a year before the bankruptcy and settlement are finalized.\n\n\u201cThis is not a sprint. We\u2019ve got a little bit of a marathon here,\u201d he said after the three-hour hearing in New York City\u2019s northern suburbs.\n\nPurdue\u2019s bankruptcy filing has effectively frozen all litigation against the company, which its lawyers said has been spending more than $250 million a year on legal and professional fees, but it has not stopped lawsuits against the Sacklers from moving forward.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, who is suing the Sacklers and opposes the proposed settlement, said last week that her office found that members of the family used Swiss and other accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves.\n\nPurdue lawyer Marshall Huebner said he hoped states that are opposed to the proposed settlement could be persuaded to change their positions.\n\n\u201cIn essence, America itself that stands to benefit or lose from the success or failure of these reorganization proceedings,\u201d Huebner said.\n\nNone of the Sacklers attended the hearing, but the family name did come up several times as Purdue lawyers declared that they wouldn\u2019t benefit from any steps taken Tuesday to keep the company in business.\n\nAs the bankruptcy unfolds, Purdue will continue to pay its approximately 700 employees under preexisting salary structures.\n\nNo member of the Sackler family is an employee and none will receive payments, Purdue lawyer Eli Vonnegut said.\n\nBecause of commitments Purdue made before the bankruptcy filing, the company will pay sign-on bonuses to five employees and retention bonuses to about 100 employees. The company agreed to hold off on seeking to continue other bonus plans, such as incentive bonuses.\n\nDrain, the judge, also allowed the company to continue covering legal fees for current and former employees, which Vonnegut estimated wouldn\u2019t exceed $1.5 million per month. The company stopped covering legal fees for members of the family on March 1, he said.\n\n\u201cWe swear up and down that no payments will go to the Sacklers,\u201d Vonnegut said.\n\nPurdue lawyers argued that the sign-on and retention bonuses were vital to attracting and keeping top talent in a tumultuous time for the company. Covering employee legal fees is important to morale and sends a strong signal that the company backs the people who work for it, the lawyers said.\n\nBankruptcy trustee Paul Schwartzberg objected, saying the bonuses went \u201cway beyond\u201d normal compensation and were padding the pockets of employees who already make upward of $300,000 a year.\n\n__\n\nFollow Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A judge cleared the way Tuesday for OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma to stay in business while it pursues bankruptcy protection and settlement of more than 2,600 lawsuits filed against it in a reckoning over the opioid crisis.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael R.
