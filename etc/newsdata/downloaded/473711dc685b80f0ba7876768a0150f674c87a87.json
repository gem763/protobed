Keeping with Encircle\u2019s easy-to-use design, the new moisture tool has an intuitive user-interface that guides technicians as they enter information.\n\nDeveloped with the help of certified restorers and water loss specialists, Encircle\u2019s Moisture tool facilitates the user through a drying plan, giving restorers a way to visually document the claim.\n\nThis visual representation illustrates the mitigation strategy through a moisture map or sketch, helping stakeholders understand what is required to dry the structure. It also includes dehumidifier and air mover calculators that follow the S500 IICRC Standard, helping technicians determine how much equipment is needed on the job.\n\nEven better, the tool features new reports to help insurers and policyholders understand the extent of the loss. Reports are available to all stakeholders on the Encircle Platform as soon as they are created.\n\n\u201cOur Moisture tool bridges the communication gap between insurers and restorers allowing both to make accurate and timely decisions,\u201d noted Paul Donald, CEO of Encircle. \u201cSimplifying the process of documenting a water loss is a game changer for the property claims industry.\u201d\n\nEven techs with little to no background in water mitigation can use the Encircle Moisture tool, allowing experienced technicians and PMs to remotely review their work to ensure that readings and equipment are properly placed. It also features helpful alerts that notify restorers when the dehumidifier is not working, allowing them to proactively mitigate issues.\n\n\u201cEncircle once again outpaces their competition in user experience with their new Moisture tool. Finally, a company in the restoration industry that knows how to create the complete field tech user experience & interface with professional reports. It just keeps getting better,\u201d added Jay Holland, Field Consultant at Restoration 1 Holdings Company.\n\nThe new Moisture tool is a key component of the Encircle platform, available now to all Encircle customers.
