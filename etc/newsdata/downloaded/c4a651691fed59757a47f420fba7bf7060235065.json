And it boasts a little gem of a tennis stadium, owned by billionaire phone mogul and America\u2019s Cup winner Larry Ellison, host to the now famous Indian Wells tennis tournament held every March - of which more later.\n\nStar quality: Palm Springs has long drawn in A-list celebrities - from Frank Sinatra through to Charlize Theron\n\n\n\nI like to visit Palm Springs every time I am in LA. You know you have reached the desert when, after about two hours\u2019 freeway driving, you go over the pass in the casino town of Cabazon, your ears pop from the change of pressure and the temperature soars by 10 degrees.\n\nOn one side is the tallest peak in southern California, Mount San Gorgonio, where Frank Sinatra\u2019s mother, Dolly, died in a plane crash. (She is buried next to Frank in the local cemetery.)\n\nOn the other is the majestic Mount San Jacinto, with its aerial tramway, from where you can see as far as California\u2019s own Dead Sea, the Salton. Between them runs the romantic highway 111 that ends in Mexico but first leads straight into the main street of Palm Springs.\n\nCreature comforts: Once a simple desert pitstop, Palm Springs now boasts restaurants and hotels aplenty\n\nAs soon as I arrive, I head for a bar and order a margarita on the rocks, not blended, and guacamole and tortilla chips. Later, I take a pavement table at Ruby\u2019s cheap and cheerful diner for chili with extra onions and watch the people go by.\n\nDowntown Palm Springs offers an increasingly lively, young bohemian scene - but drive on and the highway turns into a sophisticated main street lined with opulent winter homes and high-class shopping centres.\n\nThe romantic names of the side streets make you think you are in a cowboy movie. Deep Canyon, Shadow Mountain, Indian Trail, all sound like somewhere John Wayne would have known.\n\nFor the incorrigibly nostalgic there is a genuine Fifties\u2019 roadside diner, Keedy\u2019s - serving gloopy milkshakes and crispy hash browns - where Humphrey Bogart would have felt at home.\n\nFive minutes away is Indian Wells. For years I have watched the tennis tournament on TV, marvelling at the cloudless skies as I shivered in the English rain.\n\nRavishingly rugged: Palm Springs is framed by the San Jacinto Mountains, which like immediately to the west\n\nThis year I decided to see it first hand. Gone are the days when you could get up close and personal with the stars at events such as Wimbledon, which are now corporate jamborees.\n\nBut even though the top players flock to Indian Wells, competing for a mammoth $6 million purse, the desert matches manage to remain refreshingly intimate.\n\nI spotted some old stars in the stands, including Billie Jean King, Rod Laver and Roy Emerson, and on court some new ones, such as razor-cheeked Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov, who smashed every ball as though he was aiming it at Vladimir Putin.\n\nI took some fabulous action shots of Djokovic and Federer, and proved to myself that it is very different seeing events live rather than on TV.\n\nThis being Southern California, the commentaries are supercharged and our once polite English game is treated as a blood sport.\n\nIf you stay in one of the larger resort hotels, such as the Hyatt or La Quinta at tournament time, you could find yourself checking in next to Andy Murray. I found a quiet motel, the Mojave Resort in Palm Desert, five minutes from the stadium and handy for the boutiques and restaurants on El Paseo, the desert\u2019s version of Beverly Hills\u2019 Rodeo Drive.\n\nFull service: The Indian Wells tennis tournament draws in giants of the game, such as Roger Federer\n\nRun by a cheery Tanzanian called Mash, who used to live in London, it\u2019s a little pricey in the season at around \u00a3150 a night, but the rate drops to \u00a350 in the summer if you want to experience 100-degree heat - and everything is air-conditioned, so why not?\n\nIn any case, you can always retreat to the desert\u2019s many darkened cocktail lounges to knock back highballs like Sinatra.", "description": "It is the corner of California that has long lured the stars - from aces of the tennis court to cinematic greats.
