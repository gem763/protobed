We\u2019re still going to be fighting,\u201d Kamalani Keliikuli, vice president of Ku Kiai Kahuku, or Protectors of Kahuku, told Hawaii One News. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want the turbines, and we want them to listen to us. We\u2019re in it for the fight.\u201d\n\nActivists at a second site in Kalaeloa duct-taped and zip-tied themselves together as they sat in the middle of the road, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, while video showed protesters chanting and using their phones to film police officers.\n\nProtesters have raised objections to what they describe as health problems caused by the fast-moving turbines, including migraines and nausea from the lights, noise and motion, as well as what one activist called \u201cthe desecration of the land.\u201d\n\n#UPDATE: @honolulupolice Chief confirms 55 protestors arrested \u2014 22 in Kalaeola where wind turbine supplies are being moved from, and 33 from wind farm site in Kahuku, says they\u2019re also still investigating chain saw being used to cut down pole that blocked Kamehameha Hwy @KITV4 pic.twitter.com/81rt3msa4H \u2014 Tom George (@TheTomGeorge) October 18, 2019\n\n\n\nThe developer, AES Corp. of Arlington, Virginia, has insisted that the project is safe and delayed plans to transport the equipment Sunday after protesters blocked the convoy route.\n\nHonolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard said all 55 protesters were charged with disobeying a police order after refusing to move out of the way, and that all posted the $100 bail and were released.\n\nProtesters continue their fight today to block the installation of eight massive turbines for a wind-energy farm in #Kahuku.
