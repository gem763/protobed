Faces Congress: Live Updates", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cHe needs to resign, I will say that to his face,\u201d said Nadia Milleron, whose daughter Samya Stumo died in the second Max crash in Ethiopia in March. \u201cI think he\u2019s very bad for Boeing, he\u2019s very bad for the U.S., he\u2019s very bad for safety. He should resign, the whole board should resign.\u201d\n\nA pilot raised concerns about a new system \u2018running rampant.\u2019\n\nIn 2016, well before the 737 Max was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane\u2019s chief technical pilot told a colleague that a new system on the plane was \u201crunning rampant\u201d in simulator tests. The pilot, Mark Forkner, went on to say that he had unknowingly lied to regulators.\n\nThe messages, which were made public this month, raise serious new questions about what Boeing knew about the new system, known as MCAS, which played a role in both crashes. Boeing said in a statement that it had not been able to speak to Mr. Forkner, who now works for Southwest Airlines, about the messages.\n\nBut Mr. Muilenburg may face questions about who else besides Mr. Forkner was aware of the problems he had on the simulator, and about the pilot\u2019s belief that he had lied to regulators. Lawmakers are also likely to ask why Boeing, which has known about the messages for months, waited so long to hand the messages over to Congress and the F.A.A.\n\n\u201cBoeing should have notified the F.A.A. about that conversation upon its discovery immediately,\u201d Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said in his opening statement.\n\nThe Times was the first to report on Mr. Forkner\u2019s involvement in the Max, revealing that during the plane\u2019s development, he asked the F.A.A. to remove mention of MCAS from the training manual.", "description": "Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, is testifying before Congress for the first time since the crashes of two 737 Max jets that killed 346 people.", "authors": ["David Gelles", "Natalie Kitroeff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/business/29BOEING1/29BOEING1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
