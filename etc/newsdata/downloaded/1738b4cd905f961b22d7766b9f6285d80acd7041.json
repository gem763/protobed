In the past year, as the U.S. system buckled under waves of regressive Federal policies that overcrowd detention, the food portions and quality in Batavia have suffered as well.\n\n'Additionally, those who have medical conditions connected to diet are adversely affected by the food they receive to the point that they can become very ill in the course of their detention.'\n\nAnd while many were pleased with Lloyd's decision, several right-wing critics blasted the company for its decision. According to Cimino, co-founder for the food truck, the establishment lost three scheduled visits.\n\n'The men and women who work at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility are Detention Officers, Deportation Officers, administrative support staff, Doctors, Nurses, Judges, Attorneys, and maintenance staff,' ICE said in a statement\n\nThey received even more flack after ICE released its own statement.\n\n'The men and women who work at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility are Detention Officers, Deportation Officers, administrative support staff, Doctors, Nurses, Judges, Attorneys, and maintenance staff,' they said in a statement.\n\nCimino apologized for making the 'hastily made' decision to say sorry for serving ICE, adding that the company had 'reacted too quickly to criticism we received for that visit.'\n\n'Each and every one of them is entrusted with the safety, security, and care of the detainees here. Almost 50% of the staff are Veterans.\n\n'Families are not detained here nor has any child been here. Further, an overwhelming percentage of the detainees detained at this facility are criminal aliens, meaning, they continued to commit more crimes after illegally entering the United States.\n\n'We are doing our jobs, enforcing the laws passed by Congress. Just like we have for many Presidents. We will not apologize for doing this, not even to a food truck that now chooses to discriminate against us.'\n\nCimino apologized for making the 'hastily made' decision, adding that the company had 'reacted too quickly to criticism we received for that visit.'\n\nHe would not allude as to whether or not the company would go to those types of businesses in the future.\n\nJustice for Migrant Families WNY later posted on Facebook that they were not 'sure' if they were still getting the donation after Cimino rescinded his apology\n\n'We live in divisive times,' Cimino said, according to WIVB. 'People get emotional and feel strongly about issues like immigration policy, and social media magnifies those emotions, but we make lunch and dinner, not policy. We support all our communities.'\n\nJustice for Migrant Families WNY later posted on Facebook that they were not 'sure' if they were still getting the donation after Cimino rescinded his apology.\n\nCritics then blasted Cimino's decision to stay 'apolitical.'\n\nCritics then blasted Cimino's decision to stay 'apolitical'\n\n'They parked a truck outside of a federal detention center in Batavia and received some negativity from the left for serving employees of that facility,' said one Reddit user.\n\n'The right then got pissed that Lloyd would apologize and defended the federal detention center employees. It seems Lloyd is trying to stay as apolitical as possible but even trying to sell some tacos gets everyone all worked up.\n\n'It's the same hyper-polarized politics we're unfortunately used to seeing in this day and age.'", "description": "Lloyd Taco Trucks - Buffalo's first food truck - issued their initial apology after serving lunch at Buffalo Federal Detention Facility for the Department of Homeland Security on October 23.", "authors": ["Matthew Wright For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20333468-0-image-a-49_1572364129804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
