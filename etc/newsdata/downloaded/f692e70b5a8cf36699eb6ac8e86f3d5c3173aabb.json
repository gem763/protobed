The five runs they scored in Game 1 wasn\u2019t an accident.\n\nThe groundwork for this success was laid in conversations with manager Dave Martinez and his coaching staff going back to spring training. The two-out run-driving hits began in the batting cages at West Palm Beach, just a few hundred feet away from the Astros in the complex the two teams share. And those conversations continued even through the early struggles of this Nationals squad, when they were 19-31 and on the brink of collapse.\n\nHere\u2019s one instruction that sunk in and stuck with this veteran team \u2014 don\u2019t strike out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this a lot when we were struggling, and the strikeouts,\u201d Martinez told reporters after Washington\u2019s Game 3 victory Wednesday night. \u201cI\u2019ve always said this: Strikeouts is not OK, regardless of what people say. I don\u2019t believe in it. There\u2019s nothing comes from it when you strike out, you\u2019re just going to walk back to the dugout. I believe in just putting the ball in play. Things happen when you put the ball in play, regardless. Regardless of whether you get a hit or not. But good things happen when you constantly put the ball in play. And we\u2019ve got better at that. And tonight was a perfect example.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals continue to be the anti-trend team in baseball, the one that still relies on scouting, instead of their rivals, the Astros, who swept away much of their scouting staff two years ago and invested their resources in video and computer. It has served Houston well, with one World Series title in 2017, a trip to the American League Championship Series last year and a 107-win season this year. But the old-school ways, with a team full of old-school players, can still be a path to success in the game today.\n\nNo strikeouts? That\u2019s old school.\n\nStrikeouts have gone up every year for at least a decade, as players are being taught to try to drive the ball out of the park, even at the cost of striking out.\n\nThey have been taught the risk is worth the reward, part of the analytics movement.\n\nNot in Washington, where the value of putting the ball in play is still paramount. The players believe it is part of this team\u2019s comeback identity.\n\nAnthony Rendon was asked after Game 2 about his team\u2019s success hitting with two strikes.\n\n\u201cIf we could pinpoint one certain thing, man, I think it might just be our resilience,\u201d he said. \u201cDavey emphasized in spring training he doesn\u2019t like strikeouts. If we are striking out then obviously we\u2019re not giving ourselves a chance to get on base, we\u2019re just getting ourselves out, and obviously we\u2019re not making the defense work.\n\n\u201cWe have some speed at the top of the order, so we can run balls out and put some pressure on the defense any way possible,\u201d Rendon said. \u201cIt was great to be able to be put some balls in play and limit our strikeouts as much as we can, and just try to scratch any kind of run we can get.\u201d\n\nThis series has been portrayed as old-school versus new-school baseball, and it is never as simple as that. The Nationals have an analytics department they value and use as part of their decision making. And again, the Astros way has resulted in unprecedented success for the franchise. But the debate has also, right or not, been portrayed as humanity versus data, and right now in this series, humanity is winning.\n\nThe Nationals are oozing humanity \u2014 the dancing in the dugout, the Gerardo Parra \u201cBaby Shark\u201d movement, the Juan Soto show, the whole \u201cLet\u2019s have fun,\u201d mantra that Martinez has preached to whoever would listen, like he did after Washington\u2019s 5-4 Game 1 win over Houston. \u201cLike I tell the boys: Just one day at a time,\u201d he said, the message that has not changed over a long season.\n\n\u201cJust stay in the moment. Enjoy the moment. Have fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cFun\u201d for the Washington Nationals is winning baseball games with two strikes. After all, they\u2019ve had two strikes against them for much of the season.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
