We had a bit of a curveball when we announced your name to our family, as someone pointed out, it\u2019s possibly illegal to name you that in Australia, as it falls loosely under the category of \u2018title\u2019 like \u2018King\u2019 \u2018Duke\u2019 \u2018Lord\u2019 or \u2018Captain\u2019.\u201d\n\nSo what is this name you speak of? I hear you all gagging to know\u2026\n\n\u201cWelcome to the family Citizen Sage Alexander-Johnston.\u201d\n\nThe Byron Bay mum attempted to look into another name \u2013 but kept being drawn back to Citizen.\n\nWant to join the family?

But nothing else felt right for you as a Libra, with a [very sensible and grounded] Capricorn moon. So Citizen you are, and always will be- a Citizen of the world,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Australian law, names that are contrary to the public interest by being \u201cmisleading\u201d are banned.\n\nIt states \u201cthe name might contain an official title, position or rank recognised in the community that might mislead others as to whether the person holds that title or rank officially.\u201d\n\nHowever, the name isn\u2019t on the 46 banned names which include Admiral, Corporal, Lady, General and Captain.\n\nAtlas, Everest, Zephyr and Citizen.

And in Ancient Greece- a wise man [but you know, no pressure],\u201d Claire adds.\n\nClaire, who is already mum to Atlas, Everest and Zephyr, even described Citizen as her \u201cfavourite child.\u201d\n\nThe name was enough to divide Claire\u2019s followers, with many admitting they were unsure about her bold choice.\n\n\u201cHmm!! Not sure but good on you for being ORIGINAL!!\u201d one commented.\n\n\u201cIs his name really Citizen??\u201d another said.\n\nClaire just after giving birth to Citizen.
