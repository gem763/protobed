Like Brexit itself, no one would describe the methodology as scientific. Still, the euro\u2019s steady glide lower, throughout 2019, in step with a stream of deteriorating economic counters, has brought frequent interest in contrarian bets in favour of the pound.\n\nIn more recent weeks however, the advent of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, which heightened volatility anew, made bullish strategies more difficult to manage. On top of that, U.S.-Eurozone rate differentials have narrowed sharply this year, as the Federal Reserve becomes increasingly boxed in. True, spreads remain enormous: the two-year . differential spanned -0.786% to 1.4255% at last check. But tightening of around 1% since late January is still punchy. Tapering of the Eurozone-UK 2-year spread by 0.3% and change since mid-April is less spectacular but can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nAside from Brexit, these moves are another reason why sellers of dollars or pounds against the single currency in recent weeks, have seemed to be pushing hard at a door, unaware that it was open. Such instances, like EUR/GBP\u2019s 73-odd pip run higher in Europe on Tuesday, can pose the risk of corrective setbacks. Downing Street\u2019s unravelling Brexit negotiating strategy\u2014and possibly unravelling poise too\u2014has coincided with weak though better-than-expected German output stats and worryingly soft U.S. factory gate inflation. Upside euro momentum was seized on, but the test of whether it\u2019s run too far has already begun.\n\nThe rate was last eyeing the lower side of 0.8974. That was resistance established by clear reversals between 10th and 13th September. That makes the line a pivotal check of the euro\u2019s rebound from a floor on the 20th September. Well, the level did give way, but not sustainably, therefore the test is incomplete. RSI momentum is now tracking higher with price. Rougher trends, like the 50-hour average are also in step. Even better, the 50-HMA has provided additional support in recent sessions. In other words, conditions are ripe for the euro to capitalise more on souring Brussels-London talks, and any further retreats by Downing Street into the twilight zone. But if the single currency keeps stalling here, it will probably stall hard. In that instance, the rising trend line from September lows could be next in line top break.\n\n\u2013 Hourly [08/10/2019 16:50:17]\n\nEUR/GBP Hourly\n\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
