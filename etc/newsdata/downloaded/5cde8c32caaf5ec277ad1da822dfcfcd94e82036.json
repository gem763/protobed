Additionally, more than half of people say that finding fun in everyday life gets harder the older you get.\n\nPrevious research supports the idea that middle age is rough. Data from the U.K.\u2019s Office of National Statistics (ONS), which looked at the well-being of more than 300,000 adults over three years, found that people ages 40-59 were the least happy and most anxious. And a working paper distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that there is \u201cmuch evidence\u201d that \u201chumans experience a midlife psychological \u2018low\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there is a \u201chappiness curve,\u201d and it bottoms out in midlife, Jonathan Rauch, author of \u201cThe Happiness Curve,\u201d explained to MarketWatch\u2019s Alessando Malito. \u201cThe happiness curve is how aging, independent of other things, affects your happiness and it is U-shaped,\u201d Rauch said. \u201cIt turns out the aging process drags your happiness down through your 40s, bottoms out around 50, and then aging increases your happiness for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nSo what causes this midlife slump? The ONS researchers suggest that the juggling of the multitude of responsibilities in middle age could be to blame, including \u201cthe burden caused by having to care for both parents and children at the same time.\u201d Some 23% of American adults balance caring for their kids and their parents, and they often face financial challenges as a result, a 2015 Pew Research Center report found.\n\nMidlife doldrums could also be related to the struggle to balance careers and personal lives, the ONS researchers wrote, explaining that while younger people might still be in school, \u201cthose in their middle years may have more demands placed on their time and might struggle to balance work and family commitments.\u201d\n\nWhat should you do if you\u2019re going through a midlife slump? Try to get back the fun in your life, says psychologist Erika Martinez of Envision Wellness: \u201cBy middle age, people can be bogged down with responsibilities \u2014 mortgages, children, spouses, etc. Somewhere along the way, they stop doing the things they enjoyed when they were younger. I think the key to enjoying middle age is not to let responsibilities rule you. Keep doing, or re-engage in, the activities that you found fun and exciting before.\u201d\n\nAnd sometimes it requires you to think even bigger. \u201cIf you had big dreams when you were younger, and have not accomplished what you wanted to do, or you are feeling burned out in your career or no longer really needed as a parent because your children are grown, life can feel very empty,\u201d explains Tina B. Tessina, a psychotherapist and author of The Ten Smartest Decisions a Woman Can Make After Forty. \u201cBut, actually this is a great time to reinvent yourself on a new basis. Instead of worrying about what you haven\u2019t done, why not figure out what you can still do? It\u2019s never too late to be who you might have been!\u201d", "description": "If you\u2019re unhappy in your 40s, you\u2019re not alone.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT705_midlif_ZG_20191021112508.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
