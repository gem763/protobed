It applies to unauthorized public gatherings and police-approved protests.\n\nLam said she would go to the legislature later to get legal backing for the rule. She stressed that the use of emergency powers does not mean Hong Kong is in a state of emergency.\n\n\u201cPeople are asking can Hong Kong go back to normal? Is Hong Kong still a place where we can have our sweet home?\u201d Lam said as she announced the ban.\n\n\u201cWe must stop the violence,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all over Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nYet even as Lam wrapped up her announcement, protesters in masks and concealing themselves under umbrellas gathered in central Hong Kong.\n\nLam said the ban targets violent protesters and rioters and \u201cwill be an effective deterrent to radical behavior.\u201d Masks will be permitted for \u201clegitimate need,\u201d when their wearers can prove that they need them work, health or religious reasons.\n\nThe ban makes the wearing of full or partial face coverings, including face paint, at public gatherings punishable by one year in jail. A six-month jail term could be imposed on people who refuse a police officer\u2019s order to remove a face covering for identification.\n\nLam wouldn\u2019t rule out a further toughening of measures if violence continues.\n\nShe said she would not resign because \u201cstepping down is not something that will help the situation\u201d when Hong Kong is facing \u201ca very critical state of public danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must save Hong Kong, the present Hong Kong and the future Hong Kong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave the situation to get worse and worse.\u201d\n\nThousands of masked protesters marched in the city\u2019s business district before Lam spoke. They chanted \u201cI want to wear face masks\u201d and \u201cWearing mask is not a crime\u201d as many cars, stuck in traffic due to the march, honked in support.\n\n\u201cWill they arrest 100,000 people on the street? The government is trying to intimidate us but at this moment, I don\u2019t think the people will be scared,\u201d one protester, who gave his surname as Lui, told an online live broadcast.\n\nAt the nearby Causeway Bay shopping area, a huge crowd occupied streets to protest the mask ban. Smaller rallies were held in several other areas.\n\nFace masks have become a hallmark of protesters in Hong Kong, even at peaceful marches. As the use of police tear gas has become widespread, many young protesters have worn heavier duty gear including full gas masks and goggles.\n\nEven peaceful masked marchers cite fears they could lose jobs and be denied access to schooling, public housing and other government-funded services if identified as having taken part in demonstrations.\n\nMany also are concerned their identities could be shared with the massive state-security apparatus that helps keep the Communist Party in power across the border in mainland China, where high-tech surveillance including facial recognition technology is ubiquitous.\n\nAnalysts said the use of the Emergency Ordinance for the first time in over half a century set a dangerous precedent. The law, a relic of British rule enacted in 1922 to quell a seamen\u2019s strike and last used to crush riots in 1967, gives broad powers to the city\u2019s chief executive to implement regulations in an emergency.\n\n\u201cEven though the mask ban is just a small move under the Emergency Ordinance, it is a dangerous first step. If the anti-mask legislation proves to be ineffective, it could lead the way to more draconian measures such as a curfew and other infringement of civil liberties,\u201d said Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Chinese University.\n\nLam bristled at a suggestion that the ban nudges Hong Kong closer to the authoritarian rule imposed by the Communist Party across the rest of China.\n\nShe insisted she was not acting under orders from the central government in Beijing, which she visited this week when Communist Party leaders celebrated 70 years in power on Tuesday.\n\nThe ban followed widespread violence in the city Tuesday that marred China\u2019s National Day and included a police officer shooting a protester, the first victim of gunfire since the protests started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill.\n\nThe wounded teenager was charged with attacking police and rioting.\n\nThe movement has snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing\u2019s interference in Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. More than 1,750 people have been detained so far.\n\nActivists and many legislators have said the mask ban could be counterproductive, impractical and difficult to enforce in a city bubbling with anger and where tens of thousands have often defied police bans on rallies.\n\nThe government last month withdrew the extradition bill, widely slammed as an example of the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, but protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections of the city\u2019s leaders, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, the unconditional release of protesters and not characterizing the protests as riots.\n\n\u201cFive demands, not one less!\u201d many protesters shouted during Friday\u2019s rallies as they held up five fingers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam banned protesters from wearing masks Friday in a hardening of the government's stance on the territory's most disruptive crisis since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Leicester", "Eileen Ng"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/Hong_Kong_Protests_50974.jpg-ae908_c0-218-3000-1967_s1770x1032.jpg?9d0c8dd19ad25a0f745ecd7e1bb85a76ee2d80c4", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
