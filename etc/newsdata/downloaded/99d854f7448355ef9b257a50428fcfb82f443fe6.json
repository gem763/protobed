He rode a wave of populism that boosted his fame within the Republican party. Then he squandered it all when he broke the law on the White House lawn.\n\nAbout a week after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, the end came for one of his most ardent followers in Congress, New York\u2019s Rep. Chris Collins. Though the outcome of the president\u2019s own predicament is likely months from a resolution, the rise and fall of Collins, a boastful, head-butting, self-proclaimed political outsider with a knack for making enemies, offers, in some respects, a version of the Trump saga in miniature.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCollins, 69, leveraged his notoriety as the first Republican member of Congress to endorse Trump to hold onto his deep-red district in Western New York despite a federal indictment. Then, on Monday, after more than a year of insisting on his innocence, he resigned and pleaded guilty to two felony insider trading charges, including conspiracy to commit securities fraud and lying to the FBI. His sentencing is scheduled for January and he faces up to five years in federal prison for each count.\n\n\u201cChris Collins was not coming across as the naturally likable guy you want to have a beer with. He\u2019d be the guy working on your mortgage,\u201d said Jim Campbell, a professor of political science at the University of Buffalo. \u201cBut the bottom line is that\u2019s not what got him into trouble, and the constituents from the last election were willing to stick with him if the alternative was a Democrat and not an especially strong candidate.\u201d\n\nCollins\u2019 legal woes began in June of 2017 with an email he received while attending a picnic for members of Congress and their families at the White House. The CEO of Innate Immunotherapeutics, an Australian biotech company of which Collins was a board member and one of its largest shareholders, told him that a drug designed to combat multiple sclerosis had failed a recent test. Collins was stunned. He immediately relayed the information to his son, Cameron Collins, another prominent investor in Innate. The two spoke for about six minutes at 7:16 p.m.. As it happens, a CBS video, captured around the same time, shows Collins speaking on the phone just steps away from Jared Kushner. The federal indictment states that Collins violated the law by passing nonpublic information to his son so that he could use the information to make timely trades and tip off others. According to Buffalo News, Cameron dumped his shares the next day, saving himself $570,900 in losses, and tipped off others.\n\nReporters in Buffalo and Washington had been zeroing in on Collins\u2019 murky business ties since early 2017. Collins, then the Congressional liaison to Trump\u2019s transition team, and Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, then Trump\u2019s nominee for health secretary, had both invested in Innate. In 2015 and 2016, Price purchased shares of Innate four times, totaling between $60,000 and $110,000, according to the New York Times. That unusual behavior alerted both Democrats and government ethics groups ahead of Price\u2019s confirmation hearing in January 2017.\n\nCollins criticized national outlets for printing \u201coutright lies\u201d and ripped a page from Trump\u2019s playbook by calling his hometown paper \u201cthe fake Buffalo News.\u201d He exploited conservatives\u2019 resentment of the press and went to war with The Buffalo News in his fundraising emails. For those who had watched Collins\u2019 rise in politics, his Trumpian treatment of the press seemed out of character for Collins. Up until the News began to cover Collins\u2019 involvement with Innate, he had a more or less cordial relationship with the paper.\n\n\u201cHe was actually very helpful as a source and very accessible until all of this stuff started happening in early 2017,\u201d said Jerry Zremski, the News\u2019 Washington correspondent. \u201cI could get him talking for whatever reason. What other people saw as arrogance, I saw as a refreshing brashness.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2018, the FBI arrested Collins and charged the congressman with wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy. On Aug. 11, he announced he would suspend his re-election campaign in the wake of his indictment. But just five weeks later, Collins made a dramatic about-face and said he would remain on the ballot. The change confounded western New York Republicans who were already in the process of searching for a replacement. Erie County Republican Chair Nick Langworthy said he felt \u201ca bit like a jilted groom at the altar\u201d after Collins informed him of his decision.\n\nDespite the indictment, Collins squeaked to victory, beating the Democratic challenger Nate McMurray by about 1,000 votes. In some rural parts of the district that were news deserts, constituents had no idea the congressman had been indicted, say Zremski and McMurray who both talked with voters. Others knew about the charges but simply refused to vote for a Democrat.\n\n\u201cAmong some groups it was a badge of honor to have these legal problems, like the system was out to get him,\u201d McMurray said. \u201cAnd some people thought, \u2018This can\u2019t be true. How can the guy who comes to my gun club be a horrible person?\u2019\u201d\n\nRe-election looked less like a win for Collins himself than a victory for intense partisanship. It also seemed to be a lesson for politicians in the Trump era: You can do whatever you want, even break the law, as long as you align yourself with the president.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe parallels between Collins and Trump run deeper than their legal troubles, alliances with Tea Party fringes and cries of \u201cfake news.\u201d Long before Trump transformed himself from a real estate mogul to a president, Collins had already marketed himself as an entrepreneur-turned-politician.\n\nWhen Collins ran for Erie County executive in 2007, he pledged that he would run the government like a business. As a native of the Buffalo suburbs, I remember the sigh of relief that prospect brought to many western New Yorkers, particularly Republicans. Collins seemed like the conservative antidote for a county whose fiscal house was in such shambles that it required a state-appointed financial control board. And while he would later make several gaffes in his political career, he boasted a respectable pedigree as a first-time candidate.\n\n\u201cI was impressed with him, he seemed to have a good command of his facts, I thought he was extremely ethical,\u201d said Kevin Hardwick, a former Republican turned Democrat who serves on the Erie County Legislature and interviewed then-candidate Collins for his talk radio show. Collins had emphasized not only his business acumen, but his time as an Eagle Scout, a credential that gave him a 1950s \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d quality.\n\n\u201cChris Collins as county executive was infinitely more professional than the way the president is running the country,\u201d Hardwick said. \u201cHe got a reputation for being aloof or arrogant, but he was not incompetent, and he was always convinced he was doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nVoters had reason to believe that Collins could right the ship in Erie County. Unlike Trump\u2019s failed ventures with casinos, airlines, professional football, steaks and higher education, Collins was a self-made millionaire with a reputation as a tough manager who bought companies and fixed them up.\n\nBut they do share a certain set of personality traits.\n\n\u201cCollins is like Trump in that he really has very little patience for anyone in his way,\u201d said Matt Spina, a reporter at The Buffalo News who covered Collins\u2019 tenure as county executive. \u201cIn their minds, they cut a fuller jib than someone who had a career in government.\u201d\n\nCollins showed that obstinate side during his tenure as county executive, a job he saw as a CEO position with a legislature as his board of directors, Spina said. Like Trump, Collins clashed with that legislative body and often met them in court.\n\n\u201cHe would simply not write the check. He basically would say, \u2018If you don\u2019t like it, sue me,\u2019 and they did,\u201d said Geoff Kelly, a reporter in Buffalo who covered Collins for the city\u2019s alt-weekly, Artvoice. \u201cHe insisted that only he knew how to fix the problems and only he had the authority to do the things that needed to be done.\u201d\n\nLike Trump, he also never really stepped away from his businesses, despite campaign promises to do otherwise. As he unwound his relationships with several companies before becoming county executive, he remained an unpaid director and lead shareholder of Virionyx, a New Zealand-based biopharmaceutical company now known as Innate. Collins argued that he had stayed on because he had a responsibility to his investors, a cadre of wealthy Buffalonians that included then-Sabres coach Lindy Ruff.\n\nCollins made no friends as Erie County executive. His off-color comment about a lap-dance at New York\u2019s State-of-the-State address in 2010 led New York papers to run headlines such as \u201cCollins\u2019 Foot-in-Mouth Disease\u201d and quips like \u201cChris Collins: Running his mouth like a business.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had his flaws and was in many ways more Bidenesque than Trumpesque,\u201d Hardwick said. He wasn\u2019t lewd, like Trump at his Access Hollywood worst, but Collins could be kind of socially obtuse. I once congratulated him on his son\u2019s engagement, to which he responded by asking if I\u2019d seen the size of the ring.\n\nCollins prided himself on his reputation as a calculating businessman. During one speech, he cited a clich\u00e9 bastardization of the golden rule: \u201cRemember, he who has the gold makes the rule.\u201d The comment may have been tongue-in-cheek, but I suspect he believed there was some truth to it.\n\nHis fiscal conservatism could curdle into a Scroogelike miserliness. In 2010, he dealt a blow to working mothers when he decreased child care assistance, a cut that would reverberate into the next county executive\u2019s term. As he searched for ways to trim the county budget, he took aim at small theaters, libraries and cultural organizations in the Buffalo area, slashing operational funding in the 2011 budget for all but 10 of the largest cultural groups in the county.\n\nThe move incensed and mobilized artists to get out the vote that fall for Mark Poloncarz, a Democrat who had previously served as Erie County comptroller. While Buffalo is often lampooned by outsiders as a backwards, Rust Belt town obsessed with football and chicken wings, it boasts a vibrant cultural community that its citizens hold dear.\n\n\u201cThe night Poloncarz wins, I go to his victory party and there\u2019s like a dozen arts leaders in the crowd,\u201d said Tod Kniazuk, who led the Arts Services Initiative, a local advocacy group formed in the wake of Collins\u2019 attack on arts funding. \u201cThat advocacy was really powerful. That was something that really galvanized folks and made people realize the power we all had.\u201d\n\nCollins delivered on his promises and they turned out to be his undoing. His defeat in the 2011 county election shocked him. He soon found hope, though, in New York\u2019s 27th, a reliably conservative district that swept around the rural and suburban areas of Buffalo and Rochester. The district had recently flipped to Democratic control following another Republican congressman\u2019s scandal and subsequent resignation, but after it was redrawn it ensured victory for Collins in 2012.\n\nThe 27th District is Trump country in miniature. East of Buffalo lies the wealthy suburb of Clarence, Collins\u2019 hometown and the land of McMansions. Farther east, dairy farms dot Genesee and Wyoming counties. Conservative hopefuls vying for Collins\u2019 now-vacated seat fill the local AM radio airwaves with talk about one of the district\u2019s hottest issues: the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cYou take a Norman Rockwell main street, it\u2019s rolling fields, farms, the Great Lakes,\u201d McMurray said. \u201cIt\u2019s quintessential America, but it\u2019s quintessential America after years of decline.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nCollins had entered Congress as a traditional conservative in the model of Mitt Romney, but he began tracking Donald Trump following an encounter with him at an Erie County Republican fundraiser in 2014. Although Collins initially endorsed Jeb Bush for the Republican nomination, he was later persuaded to give Trump a look by Michael Caputo, a Buffalo Republican groomed by longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone. Once Bush\u2019s campaign floundered, Collins made it his mission to be the first member of Congress to endorse Trump.\n\n\u201cChris was very keen on being the first in the House,\u201d Caputo, a Trump campaign adviser, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a position of strength and honor if you are the first. You\u2019re correctly perceived as a brave and staunch defender.\u201d\n\nCollins had already begun cozying up to the Tea Party by that point, but he may have thrown his support behind Trump earlier than other Republicans because he saw a kindred spirit in another businessman.\n\n\u201cBoth Collins and Trump eschew the niceties of political life,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cIn the end Chris doesn\u2019t care what you think of him, he\u2019s focused on making policy. But that comes back to haunt you because when you need friends you haven\u2019t made any.\n\nThere is a sense of schadenfreude back in western New York today, that a man who had been mean and avaricious finally had his comeuppance. Critics of Collins who had filed complaints against him with the Office of Congressional Ethics in early 2017 characterized his time in Congress as \u201cself-serving\u201d and \u201cprofiteering in nature,\u201d according to The Buffalo News. Even if his policies aligned with Republicans, his cold nature never garnered allies in his own party.\n\n\u201cTrump has this persona which has allowed him to develop this base that\u2019s very loyal to him,\u201d Zremski said. \u201cCollins is very different. If you talked to people in western New York, you would find that he did not have a lot of close relationships, he didn\u2019t have that base to draw from.\u201d\n\nBut for many, including The Buffalo News\u2019 most dogged reporters, Collins\u2019 story is a tragic one.\n\nEarly this week, Zremski wrote that Collins took the guilty plea in an effort to protect his son.\n\n\u201cI think it was a crime of passion,\u201d Zremski said. \u201cHe was all in on Innate Therapeutics, he genuinely believed that it was going to cure [MS], that he was going to be a lot richer. So there he is on the White House lawn and it crushes his dream.\u201d\n\nIn the heat of the moment, Collins probably didn\u2019t think it through and did what often got him into trouble: He ran his mouth. Only this time, it wasn\u2019t an off-handed comment at a political event but a phone call that broke the law.\n\n\u201cA lot of people accuse Trump of being a narcissist, I don\u2019t think people would accuse Collins of being a narcissist,\u201d Zremski said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have that prized political possession of a self- censor.\u201d", "description": "Chris Collins mimicked the president\u2019s playbook.
