During a 12-year follow-up of these people, 10,500 deaths were recorded.\n\nAfter stripping factors that may influence results, experts found that, compared with people of a healthy weight, those who became obese between the age of 25 and middle adulthood had a 22 per cent higher risk of early death from any cause.\n\nA 49 per cent increased risk of death from heart disease was also observed.\n\nOverall, being obese during the entirety of adult life carried the biggest risks - with up to a 72 per cent increased danger of dying young.\n\nBeing obese throughout one's entire adulthood poses the greatest risk, hiking one's chances of an early death by 72 per cent\n\nPeople who lost weight and went from being obese to a healthy weight over the same period had no increased risk.\n\nHowever, the same was not true for people who lost weight when they were older.\n\nThose who moved from being obese to a healthy weight between middle age and later in life had a 30 per cent increased risk of dying early from any cause and a 48 per cent increased risk from heart disease.\n\nAlthough obesity has previously been linked to 12 separate cancers, in this study no association with weight change was reported.\n\nThe authors concluded: 'Stable obesity across adulthood, weight gain from young to middle adulthood, and weight loss from middle to late adulthood were associated with increased risks of mortality.\n\n'The findings imply that maintaining normal weight across adulthood, especially preventing weight gain in early adulthood, is important for preventing premature deaths in later life.'", "description": "Scientists from Huazhong University, China, found that gaining weight between the age of 25 and 47 hikes the chances of an early death from any cause by 22 per cent.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19793256-0-image-a-87_1571239607234.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
