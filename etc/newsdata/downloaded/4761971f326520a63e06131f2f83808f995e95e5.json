USA TODAY\n\nThe past isn't always predictive the future. But when trying to forecast the second half of the college football season, the first seven weeks of play are helpful.\n\nThere's been the expected success of Alabama, Oklahoma and Clemson and impressive showings by Ohio State, LSU and Wisconsin.\n\nThere's been disappointments from preseason Top 25 teams Texas A&M, Michigan State and Syracuse. Meanwhile, Arizona State, Baylor and SMU are surprisingly all in the current top 20.\n\nAnd the Heisman Trophy race is up in the air with three strong contenders in Jalen Hurts, Tua Tagovailoa and Joe Burrow.\n\nClemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence celebrates after scoring a touchdown during the first quarter against Florida State.

The college football staff at USA TODAY make their predictions on how it will all turn out.\n\nPower Five conference winners\n\nPaul Myerberg: Clemson, Oklahoma, Ohio State, Oregon, Alabama.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Clemson, Oklahoma, Ohio State, Oregon, Alabama.\n\nEddie Timanus: Clemson, Oklahoma, Ohio State, Oregon, LSU.\n\nErick Smith: Clemson, Oklahoma, Ohio State, Utah, Alabama.\n\nCollege Football Playoff field\n\nPaul Myerberg: Alabama, Ohio State, Clemson, Oklahoma.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Ohio State, Clemson, Alabama, Oklahoma.\n\nEddie Timanus: LSU, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Alabama.\n\nErick Smith: Alabama, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Clemson.\n\nNational champion\n\nPaul Myerberg: Clemson. This team might not be as good as year\u2019s unbeaten champion. Alabama, Ohio State and Oklahoma have been outstanding. Clemson hasn\u2019t always looked invincible. But I\u2019m banking on the Tigers having another gear in store beginning in November. Besides, this is a staff and roster that just knows what it takes to win in January.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Ohio State. The Buckeyes will ride Justin Field\u2019s emergence and a defensive resurgence to a national title in Ryan Day\u2019s first season as coach.\n\nEddie Timanus: Ohio State. Oklahoma\u2019s defense is better, but I still wouldn\u2019t call it a strength. Alabama and LSU look remarkably similar, killer offenses but not as lock-down on defense as we\u2019re accustomed to seeing from those two programs. The Buckeyes look like the total package. They haven\u2019t encountered an offense the caliber of those other three I have in the playoff field yet, but they\u2019re built to slow that kind of attack down with that devastating pass rush.\n\nErick Smith: Ohio State has gotten the headlines. Clemson has been disappointing. Oklahoma has been better than expected. Everyone seems to be overlooking Alabama. The Crimson Tide might not have the defense of recent vintage, but that offense is good enough to add another title to Nick Saban's trophy case.\n\nHeisman Trophy winner\n\nPaul Myerberg: Tua Tagovailoa. The numbers have been off the charts. Alabama has climbed to No. 1 in the Amway Coaches Poll. There\u2019s a feeling that this is Tagovailoa\u2019s year, since he led for much of last season and is seemingly destined for the NFL. That game with LSU is going to tell the story.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Tua Tagovailoa seemed the likely winner last year, when he burst onto the scene \u2013 until Kyler Murray blew past him at the last moment. All Tua has done this season is exceed last season. And when Alabama wins the SEC (beating LSU in a head-up battle with Joe Burrow), he\u2019ll have the edge.\n\nEddie Timanus: Joe Burrow. Jalen Hurts is having a spectacular season, but I have an inkling that the winning quarterback in the Alabama-LSU game will jump to the front of the line. I just have a hunch that it will be Joe Burrow. Can it hurry up and be Nov. 9, please?\n\nErick Smith: An Oklahoma quarterback can't win it three years in a row, right? That might be the only thing working against Jalen Hurts since his numbers have been great, and the Sooners are again one of the top offenses in the country. If he keeps this up, it will be hard to deny him the trophy.\n\nTeam to fall out of the top 10 by end of year\n\nPaul Myerberg: Florida. This feels like the safest bet, though I was tempted to go with Notre Dame (and spent a split-second thinking about Penn State\u2019s tough second-half schedule). The Gators still have three tough games away from home in South Carolina, Georgia and Missouri.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Florida\u2019s trajectory in year 2 under Dan Mullen is upward. The Gators have been impressive so far, beating Auburn and playing fairly well in a shootout loss to LSU. But the annual clash with Georgia in Jacksonville looms, and there\u2019s also a trip to Missouri. And the season finishes with rival Florida State. Florida doesn\u2019t have to fall far, but it might finish out of the Top 10.\n\nEddie Timanus: Penn State. The Nittany Lions have been very good in the first half, but I see at least one more loss on that schedule and possibly two with road trips to Michigan State and Minnesota before the Ohio State encounter.\n\nErick Smith: Notre Dame is still lacking that extra gear on offense and that is going to be problematic with second-half trips to Michigan and Stanford. That Georgia loss that seemed to good in September has lost some luster with the Bulldogs slipping.\n\nTop 25 team that will finish in the top 10\n\nPaul Myerberg: Oregon. This is based on how the Ducks have looked across the past few weeks, though the pick could fall flat as soon as Saturday\u2019s rivalry game with Washington. The offense has picked up and the defense ranks third nationally in scoring. That\u2019s a good combination. Oregon is currently favored in every game the rest of the regular season.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Oregon lost its first game, to Auburn, and probably fell out of the Playoff race at that point. But the Ducks coulda, woulda, shoulda won that game. They\u2019ve got a serious defense. They\u2019re really good.\n\nEddie Timanus: Oregon. Assuming the Ducks can get by Washington this weekend, which I believe they can, they should be favored in all their remaining games. The trip to Arizona State on Nov. 23 is a potential obstacle, but they\u2019ll crack the top 10 if they take care of business and win the Pac-12.\n\nErick Smith: Boise State. The Broncos quietly keep cruising along with an unbeaten record and it doesn't seem anybody can stop them in the Mountain West. They might have to win a New Year's Six bowl to accomplish the feat, but we've seen that done recently by a Group of Five participant.\n\nUnranked team to finish in the poll\n\nPaul Myerberg: Iowa State. A muffed punt cost the Cyclones in an 18-17 loss to Iowa. A redshirt freshman\u2019s first career field goal led to a 23-21 loss to Baylor. One or two plays currently separates ISU from being 5-0 and in the mix for the top 10. While Oklahoma and Texas are still to come, I think the Cyclones get to eight or nine wins to give the Big 12 four ranked teams.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Iowa State started in the rankings, but fell out after losing to Iowa and stumbling against Baylor. But the Cyclones are good enough to cause issues in the Big 12, and maybe still to reach the Big 12 championship game.\n\nEddie Timanus: Central Florida. We might have given up on them too early. The Knights still have a path to win the American. With the league a lot stronger at the top this year, that will actually include some quality \u2018W\u2019s.\n\nErick Smith: Pittsburgh. The Panthers are playing their best football as the race in the ACC Coastal heats up. A repeat division crown looked unlikely after a loss to Virginia in the season opener, but look for Pat Narduzzi's team to get back to Charlotte if it keeps up the momentum of the last month.\n\nMost significant coach firing\n\nPaul Myerberg: Derek Mason. He\u2019s reached two bowl games in the past three years and received an extension in February. Still, it\u2019s hard to shake off Saturday\u2019s 34-10 loss at home to lowly UNLV, which dropped Vanderbilt to 1-5 with only one clear win (East Tennessee State on Nov. 23) the rest of the way. The this year\u2019s offense is poor isn\u2019t surprising given the program\u2019s track record under Mason, but the defense ranks 129th nationally (ahead of only Massachusetts) in yards allowed per play.\n\nGeorge Schroeder: Clay Helton has done good work at USC, but the expectations there are at least as high as anywhere, and he hasn\u2019t met them. A 3-3 record at midseason likely seals the fate of a coach who entered the season on a very hot seat.\n\nEddie Timanus: Willie Taggart, Florida State. The gap between FSU and Clemson is not closing. If anything, it\u2019s getting wider. It\u2019ll cost money, but this fan base and administration can\u2019t afford to be patient with what is supposed to be the school\u2019s signature sport.\n\nErick Smith: Lovie Smith is respected by the Illinois administration. He's worked hard to improve recruiting and change the direction of the program. It just isn't going in the right direction. Hard to see a turnaround in the second half that convinces his bosses to keep him around for a fifth season.", "description": "With the first half of the season done, it's time to look ahead to the rest of the college football campaign.
