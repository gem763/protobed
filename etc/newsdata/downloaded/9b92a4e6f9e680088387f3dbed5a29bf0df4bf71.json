We are honestly emotionally drained and devasted, it\u2019s a huge investment. But we are here with the police and community leaders and are convening a community meeting. The community must tell us who did this. It can\u2019t be business as usual when a school is broken into.\u201d\n\nLesufi said this crime occurred at a crucial time, as learners are preparing for exams.\n\nTwo months ago, the Education MEC said that school vandalism and theft have cost the department more than R120 million just this year alone.\n\nThe department said that out of the 256 schools in Gauteng, 262 criminal cases had been registered since January.A number of school break-ins were reported in several parts of the country this year.\n\nMost of the losses were incurred on the East where thieves targeted more than 50 schools.Police are investigating the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Lesufi \u2018Devastated\u2019 After Equipment Stolen From Soweto School appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "Lesufi \u2018Devastated\u2019 After Equipment Stolen From Soweto School", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/World_News_9_800x533_L_1420026261.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
