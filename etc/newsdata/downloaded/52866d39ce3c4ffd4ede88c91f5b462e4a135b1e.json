They are set to vote on a motion for a December 12 poll on Monday.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has previously managed to sway the bloc's extension decisions significantly from the plans prepared in advance of the bloc's meetings and the line Paris would take is another risk factor on Friday.\n\nRead More: Could France go against all odds and veto a long extension for Brexit?\n\nA second EU official said: \"We'll see tomorrow. Might also be an argument for waiting one day more to see what happens in London.\"\n\nA third one added: \"If there are elections in the UK, it is clear to everybody that we need to give Britain a long extension.\"\n\nThe draft text also said: \"The further extension cannot be allowed to undermine the regular functioning of the (European) Union and its institutions,\" a clause the bloc hopes would shield its vital interests from the protracted Brexit drama.\n\nMore than three years since Britons voted out, the fate of Brexit remains uncertain, ranging from a disorderly split at the end of this month, to another delay and a national election in bitterly divided Britain.", "description": "Brussels has delayed its decision on a Brexit extension, an EU source told Euronews, adding the agreement will likely be decided upon next Monday or Tuesday.", "authors": ["Cristina Abellan Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/75/72/1000x563_cmsv2_800542d7-cfe1-5ff4-9a1c-630f41762e42-4257572.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
