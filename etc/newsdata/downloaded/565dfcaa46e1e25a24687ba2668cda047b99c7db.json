Salman Khurshid, a leader with the main opposition Congress party, said that Mr Abdullah had \"upheld the unity and integrity\" of India.\n\nRegional politician MK Stalin tweeted that the move was \"excessive, arbitrary and unlawful\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @mkstalin I am deeply concerned about the detention of former J&K Chief Minister and Member of Parliament, Dr Farooq Abdullah under Public Safety Act.\n\n\n\nThe act of placing one of the seniormost political leaders in a jail within a jail is excessive, arbitrary and unlawful. pic.twitter.com/Hv89BC6Lod \u2014 M.K.Stalin (@mkstalin) September 17, 2019 Report\n\nThe announcement that Mr Abdullah would now be detained under the PSA came hours after a regional politician from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, Vaiko, filed an application in the Supreme Court, asking for Mr Abdullah to be produced before the court.\n\nHe had said that there were \"competing claims\" about where Mr Abdullah - a member of India's upper house of parliament - was.\n\nThe court, in turn, asked the government to respond by 30 September.\n\nEarlier, Home Minister Amit Shah had told parliament that Mr Abdullah was \"not detained\". He was responding to criticism that the government had not followed procedure in informing parliament about the arrest of a member of the house beforehand.\n\nCorrespondents say the decision to detain Mr Abdullah could well be an attempt to pre-empt any court decision compelling the government to release him even for a few days, as this could be used as a precedent to release other people currently under detention.\n\nThe government is believed to have detained thousands of people including activists, local politicians and businessmen. Many have been shifted to jails in cities outside the region.\n\nHowever, there has been some social media support for the government's decision as well.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @54_sundar Life coming a full cycle for all rascals- karma catching up.
