With Tottenham it always feels as though if they do this [clicks fingers] then they are back again.\u2019\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer frustrated Jurgen Klopp at Old Trafford (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe \u2018different way\u2019 Klopp believes United set up against Liverpool is much more defensively than they do against other teams.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s tactics very nearly gave his side a victory last Sunday as it took a late Adam Lallana equaliser to rescue a point for Klopp\u2019s men at Old Trafford after Marcus Rashford opened the scoring in the first half.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not the person who should be frustrated by United\u2019s style,\u2019 said the Liverpool boss. \u2018In the last years they just defend, that\u2019s how it is, it\u2019s no criticism, it\u2019s just a fact.\n\n\u2018When you think United v Liverpool you think both teams attacking, but it\u2019s not. You [United] can\u2019t play against each team like this.\u2019\n\nKlopp is clearly expecting a much more open game against Spurs on Sunday when Mauricio Pochettino takes his team to Anfield.\n\nAlthough, how offensive Pochettino will want to be on Merseyside is yet to be seen, after the Argentinian described the Reds as the favourites to lift the Premier League title this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Yes, Liverpool is the favourites,\u2019 said the Spurs boss. \u2018Of course it\u2019s so early in the season but Liverpool and Manchester City are the clear favourites to win the title this season.\u2019\n\nMORE: Harry Redknapp predicts where Tottenham will finish in Premier League and warns Liverpool\n\nMORE: Roberto Firmino is the best Liverpool player to watch, claims Peter Crouch", "description": "Jurgen Klopp admits that Liverpool struggle to 'be themselves' when they take on Manchester United at Old Trafford.
