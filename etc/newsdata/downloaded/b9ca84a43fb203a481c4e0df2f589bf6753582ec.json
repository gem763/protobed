Not just the idea that this year\u2019s game is going to be the one that rejuvenates the series, following the encroachment of Fortnite and others (which has been going on since 2017\u2019s WWII) but the concept of having a purposefully shocking story campaign that rips scenarios from news headlines and presents its violence and excess as an attempt to portray the realities of modern warfare.\n\nIt certainly worked for the original Modern Warfare back in 2007, of which this is a loose reboot, but reached the pinnacle of its shamelessness with 2009\u2019s Modern Warfare 2 and its infamous No Russian mission \u2013 where you got to take part in a civilian massacre at an airport. The inclusion of that scene was always indefensible, but it certainly did its job in terms of causing controversy and getting the game talked about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis new Modern Warfare has one eye on that same ploy but rather than pure exploitation tries to wrap it in a story that does have something intelligent to say about modern soldiery. The idea that there\u2019s some kind of thoughtful anti-war message going on at the game\u2019s heart, as suggested before the game\u2019s release, is debatable, but while the campaign remains bombastic and exciting Modern Warfare has finally shaken off the ghost of Michael Bay and is now something that can be taken a lot more seriously.\n\nAs usual (except for last year\u2019s Black Ops 4, which had a Battle Royale mode instead of a story campaign) Call Of Duty is a game of three parts: the campaign, the multiplayer, and a co-op mode. We\u2019ll deal with the latter two at a later date, not least so we can play it on live servers, so this review will consider only the single-player campaign.\n\nThe campaign works along the same principles as the earlier games, in that you control multiple different characters which are switched in and out as the story demands. None of them, no matter how important they seem to be, is safe from a scripted death if the game deems it necessary, to the point where you even worry about the seemingly invincible Captain Price. Although this time you also get to play as a rebel fighter called Farah, who\u2019s from a fictional Middle East country and easily the game\u2019s most interesting and sympathetic character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plot has similar ingredients to the original, with Russians and an Al-Qaeda like terrorist group your main opponents. But while they are still the obvious go-to villains for a game like this, they\u2019re not really the focus of the narrative. Instead, the game is interested in portraying not just the horrors of war but the very modern problem of civilian involvement and where the lines blur between innocent people and legitimate combatants.\n\nModern Warfare absolutely earns its 18-rating, not so much in terms of the gore but the genuinely disturbing scenarios that are brought up, including torture, purposeful civilian deaths, and chemical warfare. For example, the already infamous flashback sequence with Farah as a child, which was teased before the game\u2019s release, involves a chemical attack on a town and her having to knife to death a full-grown Russian soldier while she\u2019s just a child.\n\nIt\u2019s all deeply upsetting stuff, as is another scene which, like No Russian, you don\u2019t even have to get involved in if you don\u2019t want to \u2013 and yet, unlike No Russian, there is a clear point being made by it. In each case the protagonist feels they\u2019re doing the right thing, and often the end result is beneficial, but the cost is always perilously high. It\u2019s also interesting that the three main groups of protagonists all have a different approach, with Farah being the moral centre and Price far more willing to perform questionable acts for the supposed greater good.\n\nCall Of Duty: Modern Warfare (PS4) \u2013 COD with a conscience\n\nThe disappointment with the story campaign though is that it doesn\u2019t quite have the courage to follow through entirely. While you\u2019re playing, you\u2019re constantly questioning what you\u2019re doing and the motivations of the characters, but by the end the story lets them all off the hook and meekly decides that since they all meant well there\u2019s no need to question things further. You as player will, but it\u2019s a shame the game cops out from doing so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe campaign also could have been a little braver in terms of breaking past the established Call Of Duty gameplay conceit of listening to the instructions of a commanding officer and essentially just doing what you\u2019re told. This has been at the heart of series\u2019 single-player gameplay for a decade now and even with the amazing visuals of this new game the spell is often broken and you realise you\u2019re just carrying out stage directions that are very difficult to get wrong and where there\u2019s little to no punishment if you do.\n\nModern Warfare is aware of how familiar its tricks will be to veteran players though and it does manage to subvert itself on a few occasions, most notably when you\u2019re directing someone yourself using security cameras to help them escape from an embassy.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not an issue in more action-oriented sections, which rely on the series\u2019 always excellent gunplay, but that\u2019s never really been what the campaigns are about \u2013 since if you wanted all-out action you\u2019d just go and play the multiplayer. Not that those sequences aren\u2019t entertaining but the ones you\u2019ll remember are usually those where Price is whispering instructions to you over your earpiece and the tone is closer to that of a stealth game than a multiplayer shooter. (And, yes, of course there\u2019s a version of All Ghillied Up, although it\u2019s not a just a straight rehash, which is appreciated.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCall Of Duty: Modern Warfare campaign review summary\n\nDespite its issues this new Modern Warfare is an impressive achievement and deserves to be taken seriously. Or at least it would be if not for the fact that despite all its careful consideration of the civilian cost of war and acceptable modern tactics it then goes and throw white phosphorous into the multiplayer mode, which seems to contradict everything the campaign is about. The Call Of Duty campaigns have often felt like their own separate games and this more than ever feels like it probably should have been.\n\nIt\u2019s not only of a high enough quality to stand on its own but it wouldn\u2019t have to mix its messages by being just one third of a larger package. Whether that will ever happen we don\u2019t know but as disturbing as it is it\u2019s good to have the campaign back and it\u2019s impressive to see it take itself so seriously.\n\nScore: 7/10\n\nFormats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, and PC\n\nPrice: \u00a359.99\n\nPublisher: Activision\n\nDeveloper: Infinity Ward\n\nRelease Date: 25th October 2019\n\nAge Rating: 18\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare has leaked and people are already playing it\n\nMORE: Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare will not have loot boxes at launch says Infinity Ward\n\nMORE: Fans angry at Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare Survival mode PS4 exclusivity", "description": "The story campaign for the new Call Of Duty is the most violent and disturbing so far, but what does it have to say about modern warfare?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot_4-46c3_1571998275.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
