One of three articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee against Mr. Nixon before he resigned in 1974 charged that he \u201cwillfully disobeyed\u201d congressional subpoenas, thereby \u201csubstituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry.\u201d\n\nIn his report to Congress in 1998, Mr. Starr argued that among the grounds for impeachment was what the prosecutor considered Mr. Clinton\u2019s \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cpatently groundless\u201d assertions of executive and other privileges to thwart a perjury and obstruction of justice investigation stemming from the president\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky. In that case, though, the House opted against including such a charge in the articles of impeachment passed against Mr. Clinton.\n\nIn some ways, Mr. Trump is employing a version of Mr. Clinton\u2019s strategy, albeit on steroids. During Mr. Starr\u2019s investigation, Mr. Clinton repeatedly sought to block testimony or documents, only to be overruled by the courts, just as Mr. Nixon was in the Supreme Court\u2019s groundbreaking and unanimous U.S. v. Nixon decision. Unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Clinton finally agreed to testify before Mr. Starr\u2019s grand jury, although only after refusing six times and eventually being subpoenaed.\n\nWhen the Republican-led House took up the matter, it did little original investigating of its own, relying primarily on Mr. Starr\u2019s findings, so there were not the sort of subpoenas to resist the way Mr. Trump is now. But Mr. Clinton likewise felt outrage about the effort to impeach him, convinced that it was a partisan witch-hunt, and set about discrediting it with the public.\n\nHouse Republicans rejected protections and limits sought by Mr. Clinton\u2019s team, and his Democratic allies attacked the process, accusing the other side of railroading the president and making it an us-versus-them fight to keep wavering Democrats on Mr. Clinton\u2019s side. House Democrats privately called their strategy \u201cwin by losing,\u201d reasoning that the more process motions they lost on partisan votes, the more illegitimate the effort would seem.\n\nIn the end, the House voted almost entirely on party lines to impeach Mr. Clinton and, with Democrats sticking by him, the Senate voted to acquit him after a trial \u2014 the scenario that, flipping the parties, looks most likely to repeat itself with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIn one respect, President Trump seems to be borrowing from the Clinton White House playbook,\u201d said Ken Gormley, the author of \u201cThe Death of American Virtue\u201d about Mr. Clinton\u2019s battle with Mr. Starr. \u201cHe is attempting to throw gasoline over the entire impeachment process in the House and light a match, in order to cause a conflagration and treat the entire process as illegitimate from the start.\u201d", "description": "At its core, it is born out of the cold calculation that Mr. Trump probably cannot stop the Democrat-led House from impeaching him.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/us/politics/09dc-assess/09dc-assess-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
