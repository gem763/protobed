While he was one of Shiite Islam\u2019s most important figures, the holiday is also marked in some largely Sunni countries like Morocco.\n\nIn most places, Ashoura is an emotional time in remembrance of the historic events that led to Hussein\u2019s death. Hussein\u2019s killing has been attributed with cementing the schism between Shiite and Sunni Islam.\n\nWhile in countries such as Iraq believers weep over his death or beat their own backs with chains, in Morocco, religious and cultural traditions give the day a unique celebratory atmosphere.\n\nFamilies gather at home to eat a variety of sweets, dried fruits, and pastries that are served up throughout the Ashoura week. Traditional couscous meals with meat and vegetables are cooked, as women sing songs that are chanted to the beat of newly-bought Taarejs, colorful drums which are given as gifts to children. Girls get traditional henna tattoos for the occasion.\n\nThe rituals don\u2019t end there.\n\nAs night falls, people spill out onto the streets. Children light sparklers and ask for treats, in an atmosphere reminiscent of Halloween.\n\nCrowds of youths in cities like Sale on the Atlantic Coast ignite flares and fireworks - despite an annual crackdown on sales by authorities in an effort to reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nIn open spaces, young people drag tires and light them up, as residents gather to watch a huge bonfire blaze under the night sky.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Women thrumming drums, children devouring rich pastries, red flares lighting up the sky - these are telltale signs that Moroccans are marking Ashoura.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mosa'Ab Elshamy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/morocco_ashura_photo_gallery_95495_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
