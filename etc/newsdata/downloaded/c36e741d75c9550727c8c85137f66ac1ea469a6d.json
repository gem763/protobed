The agency downgraded Typhoon Hagibis' intensity to \"powerful\" from \"very powerful\" around 6 p.m.\n\nIt is forecast to bring winds of 216 kph to the Tokai region in central Japan and the Kanto-Koshin region, including the Tokyo metropolitan area, and could potentially knock down houses, the agency had warned.\n\nA street is empty in Yokohama on Saturday afternoon.
