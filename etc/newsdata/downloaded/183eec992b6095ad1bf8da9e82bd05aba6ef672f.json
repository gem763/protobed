Was it racist when Ronald Reagan had it?\" she asked. She got back many answers of \"yes.\"\n\nT.I. asked the conservative pundit, \"Which period in America was great that we're trying to replicate?\" and all hell broke loose.\n\nTo be fair to Owens, she was backed into a corner in a room that clearly did not see her way of thinking.\n\nShe went on to explain that \"Slavery was all over the world,\" before everyone broke out in gasps and boos.\n\nT.I. yelled, \"I wanna like you so bad, because you're so smart.\"\n\nThere was so much clamor, Diddy had to instruct everyone to let T.I. and Owens have the floor.", "description": "things got wild", "authors": ["Gary Trock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PH3j3tLLf.TZxSPS8o1WgQ--~B/aD0xNjkxO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/1bffe4642709f6b6bb830cdcb340289b", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
