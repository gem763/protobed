GEORGE, Utah (AP) - St. George Regional Airport in southwestern Utah reopened Thursday to landings and takeoffs by airplanes after a four-month closure of its runway for reconstruction.\n\nThe old runway was constructed eight years ago and was expected to last 20 years but needed to be replaced because it was very bumpy and required patching due to underlying clay that expanded at various rates.\n\nThe reconstruction included digging out 17 feet (5 meters) of clay and soil, adding drainage and moisture barriers and installing new pavement.\n\nThe runway project cost approximately $26 million, with a federal grant paying for most of it.\n\nWhile commercial flights and general aviation use of the airport was curtailed during the runway closure, helicopters were able to continue to use the airport.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "St. George Regional Airport in southwestern Utah reopened Thursday to landings and takeoffs by airplanes after a four-month closure of its runway for reconstruction.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
