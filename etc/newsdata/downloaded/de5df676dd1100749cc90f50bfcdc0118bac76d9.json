It\u2019s reminiscent of a family business, which makes sense, because that\u2019s the model Trump has known his entire adult life.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s uncertain status says something about Trump\u2019s mind-set. In the face of this latest peril, and nearly 1,000 days into his tenure, he still hasn\u2019t settled on how the West Wing should run. Confronting the impeachment threat is a West Wing staff that Trump has largely neutered. Aides have been left guessing about who\u2019s coming and going, much less what they\u2019re supposed to say about accusations that Trump pressured Ukraine to ferret out dirt on his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden. In the two weeks since the whistle-blower complaint was released to the public, the White House still hasn\u2019t articulated a clear legal, political, or communications strategy needed to withstand impeachment and keep Trump\u2019s Republican support from eroding.\n\nInside the West Wing, Mulvaney is one of several top aides, including Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who are leading the response to the House impeachment probe. From his office just down the hall from the Oval, Mulvaney has been holding multiple meetings a day dedicated to the fallout from the whistle-blower report accusing Trump of abuse of office, a White House official told me on the condition of anonymity, because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for Trump to question associates about how aides are performing, and it doesn\u2019t always mean he wants a particular person gone. Over the past couple of weeks, Trump has also mused that ousting Mulvaney at this moment of his presidency might make matters worse. The president is wary of being seen as shaking up his senior staff with no assurance the next chief will be an improvement, the person close to Trump said.\n\nFor his part, Mulvaney doesn\u2019t seem worried\u2014about any of it. In staff meetings, Mulvaney has said that impeachment is likely to boomerang and result in a decisive defeat for Democrats in the 2020 election, the White House official told me. As for Trump questioning whether Mulvaney is up to the task, the official added: \u201cThat\u2019s not a leading indicator at all. [Mulvaney] could not be happier about the challenges of the job, and is pleased with the role. His feeling is the president is similarly happy with him. The relationship is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nRead: Trump\u2019s chief of staff says he\u2019s having a ball\n\nThere\u2019s a certain irony in Trump questioning whether Mulvaney is the right person to see him through the crisis. Trump promoted Mulvaney partly because he didn\u2019t want a disciplinarian in the mold of the previous chief, retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, who left his White House post last December.", "description": "President Trump has not ruled out replacing his third chief of staff in less than three years.", "authors": ["Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2QCH9/facebook.jpg?1570575151", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
