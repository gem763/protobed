Kamala Harris (D-CA) has been forced to lay off dozens of campaign staffers at her Baltimore headquarters as her flailing bid for the White House continues to suffer from poor polling figures and money woes, according to a report.\n\nPolitico writes Wednesday that in addition to the layoffs in Baltimore, Harris\u2019s campaign is also slashing or re-deploying staff at her offices in key primary states such as Iowa, New Hampshire, and California. Further, the Harris campaign is cutting salaries of top officials, including campaign manager Juan Rodriguez, who was earning $10,000 per month. \u201cHarris\u2019 consultants will also have their payments reduced and the campaign plans to trim and renegotiate other contracts to slash overhead,\u201d Politico reports.\n\nHarris\u2019 sluggish fundraising performance, paired with overspending, has prompted some inside and outside of her campaign to wonder how long she can keep running for the highest office in the land. In the third quarter, Harris blew $14.6 million but only raised $11.8 million \u2014 leaving her with a $2.8 million spending gap. Additionally, her campaign deferred around $900,000 in debts, an accounting trick that inflated her cash on hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unsustainable path,\u201d Ami Copeland, who served as deputy national finance director for Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, told Politico.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the best you\u2019ll squeeze out bringing all of the assets to bear, it\u2019s looking very dire,\u201d Copeland said of Harris\u2019 third-quarter figures.\n\nOne unnamed Democrat donor, who gave the maximum amount to Harris\u2019 campaign, expressed frustration with her lack of fundraising prowess.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s from fucking California. The idea that you don\u2019t have support of high-dollar donors doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d the donor told Politico. \u201cI blame her.\u201d\n\nHarris, whose poll numbers have steadily declined since launching her White House bid in January, sits in fifth place with 4.9 percent support nationally, a Real Clear Politics average of polls shows. A recently-released KQED survey shows Harris quickly losing ground to frontrunners, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in her home state of California. The poll shows Warren leading with primary voters with 28 percent, while Sanders enjoys 24 percent support and former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg sits in fourth with 9 percent followed by Harris with a mere 8 percent.", "description": "Kamala Harris has been forced to lay off dozens of campaign staffers at her\u00a0Baltimore headquarters amid money woes, according to a report.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178669283-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
