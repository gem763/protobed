Wales face Uruguay in the country\u2019s far southwest, which is out of the path of the storm.\n\nBut the match everyone is interested in is hosts Japan against Scotland, scheduled to be played in Yokohama near Tokyo at 7:45pm (1045 GMT).\n\nIf current forecasts are correct, Hagibis will be well into the sea east of Japan by then but organisers will need to assess any potential damage to the venue and also judge transport disruption.\n\nThe match is crucial as Japan aim to make it into their first World Cup quarter-final, which they will guarantee if they avoid defeat to the Scots.\n\nIf the match is cancelled, it will be classed as a 0-0 draw and both teams will get two points, sending Scotland home.\n\nEven the possibility of a cancellation has sparked a row. Scotland threatened legal action if they were eliminated without playing the key match, prompting a stern response from World Rugby which stressed safety was paramount.\n\nHagibis has also disrupted the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka, where Saturday\u2019s qualifying session has been moved to race day on Sunday.\n\nThe typhoon is forecast to crash into central or eastern Japan early Saturday evening, packing maximum gusts of 216 kilometres per hour (134 miles per hour) Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency said.\n\nHagibis is forecast to be the first storm rated \u2018very strong\u2019 to hit the nation\u2019s main island of Honshu since 1991, when Japan\u2019s category system was introduced.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Rugby World Cup officials said they would inspect venues for Sunday\u2019s matches immediately after Typhoon Hagibis has passed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/252ec5_world-rugby-has-axed-two-matches-scheduled-saturday-world-rugby-decide-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
