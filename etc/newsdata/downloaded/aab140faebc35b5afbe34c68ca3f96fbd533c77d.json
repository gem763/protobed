A spokesperson for McCarthy confirmed his comments.\n\nMcConnell added that the administration reached out to him before the operation went public, but after the raid occurred, but they failed to connect. McConnell was spotted talking with Trump during Sunday night's World Series baseball game.\n\n\"The administration attempted to let me know. I didn't connect with them before the president's press conference, but they attempted to let me know before he went public. So the two situations were handled exactly the same from my point of view,\" McConnell added.\n\nThe disclosure that top members of congressional GOP leadership weren't notified comes after top Democrats noted on Sunday that Trump failed to give them advanced notice despite being members of the Gang of Eight \u2014 the group of lawmakers with the highest access to classified information.\n\nThe top two Republicans on Capitol Hill say they were not notified by the administration ahead of the weekend raid that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\"The House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region.
