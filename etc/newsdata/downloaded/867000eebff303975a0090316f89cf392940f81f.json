As the president sees it, this detail is key because, in his mind, it knocks down the quid-pro-quo allegation.\n\nAs the story goes, in order for there to be extortion, one of the parties involved needs to know it\u2019s being extorted. If Ukraine didn\u2019t realize Trump had blocked aid, then there was no way for the Republican to have leverage over his counterpart in Kyiv.\n\nAmong the problems with this argument is that it appears to be completely wrong. The New York Times reported this morning:\n\n[I]n fact, word of the aid freeze had gotten to high-level Ukrainian officials by the first week in August, according to interviews and documents obtained by The New York Times. The problem was not a bureaucratic glitch, the Ukrainians were told then. To address it, they were advised, they should reach out to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, according to the interviews and records. The timing of the communications about the issue, which have not previously been reported, shows that Ukraine was aware the White House was holding up the funds weeks earlier than United States and Ukrainian officials had acknowledged. And it means that the Ukrainian government was aware of the freeze during most of the period in August when Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and two American diplomats were pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to make a public commitment to the investigations being sought by Mr. Trump.\n\nThis reporting reinforces what the other evidence has already suggested. As the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent noted this morning, acting U.S. Ambassador Bill Taylor testified yesterday on U.S. officials telling the Ukrainian government that \u201cthe security assistance money would not come until Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Wall Street Journal reported last month that Ukrainian officials \u201cexpressed concern to U.S. senators that the [military] aid had been held up as a penalty for resisting that pressure\u201d to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nAll of which suggests Ukraine was, in fact, well aware of the circumstances as Trump\u2019s scheme unfolded.\n\nI\u2019m trying to think of a Republican argument that\u2019s come up over the last month, intended to defend the White House, that\u2019s stood up to scrutiny. Honestly, nothing comes to mind.", "description": "Trump's latest argument is that Ukraine didn't know what the White House was withholding military aid.
