The statute allows law enforcement to remove guns from people believed to be a threat. Cole, who was not arrested nor charged with any crime, is now prohibited from owning guns for a year under the Extreme Risk Protection Order obtained against him.\n\n\u201cThis is a hate-filled human being, but unfortunately one who possesses really alarming numbers of weapons,\u201d Holmes told KING-TV.\n\nPolice seized five military-style assault rifles, a shotgun, three semiautomatic handguns and other gun components, according to officials.\n\nThe Atomwaffen Division reportedly has several chapters in the U.S. Members have been linked to five homicides, and the group is under investigation by the FBI. Followers hold so-called \u201chate camps\u201d to share ideology and fighting techniques to prepare for a \u201crace war,\u201d ProPublica has reported.\n\nCole is an admitted member. Police believe he has helped organize hate camps and provided firearms training, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cIt appears that he has gone from espousing hate to now taking active steps or preparation for an impending \u2018race war,\u2019\u201d Seattle law enforcement authorities said in their court petition last month to obtain the order against Cole.\n\nCole was permanently banned from Canada last year because of concerns about his links to a \u201cterror\u201d organization, according to the petition.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center describes the group as a terror organization that aims to use violence for \u201capocalyptic, racial cleansing.\u201d\n\nThe Atomwaffen Division is among the most extreme groups of a rising threat of right-wing violence in the U.S., something the Trump administration rarely addresses.\n\nThe far right accounted for 73% of extremist murders in the U.S. between 2009 and 2018, according to data from the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, compared with 23% by Islamic extremists. In a Capitol Hill hearing earlier this year, Kevin McAleenan, who was then acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security but has since left the position, described white supremacist violence as a \u201chuge issue\u201d and an \u201cincreasingly concerning threat.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThis is a hate-filled human being; unfortunately one who possesses really alarming numbers of weapons,\u201d said the city attorney.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dabe1c72100001b1934a77d.jpeg?cache=zmxzhctbun&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
