REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares\n\nPORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian police used tear gas and live ammunition on Friday to disperse increasingly violent protesters in the capital, witnesses said, as anger over the economic and political problems in the country grew.\n\nHaitians are protesting widespread food and fuel shortages, a weakening currency, double-digit inflation and graft accusations lodged against public officials in the impoverished Caribbean nation.\n\nMany are calling for President Jovenel Moise to stand down after what they say is a failure to address the myriad of problems. Four people died in clashes in recent days.\n\nThe protests on Friday were among the largest and most violent in months, with witnesses reporting that a special unit of the Haitian National Police was looted and a police vehicle set on fire.\n\nIn the wealthier neighbourhoods of Delmas and Petion Ville, angry crowds also looted several stores, banks and money transfer offices, ATMs and pharmacies. They also set a building on fire.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to calm tensions, Moise on Thursday replaced several security officials after calls from human rights groups to remove people they accused of involvement in a massacre in the poor La Saline neighbourhood in the capital.\n\nMoise also cancelled his speech at the United Nations General Assembly this week and made a rare address to the nation.\n\nHe suggested a unity government in the hope of calming tempers after a ruling-party senator fired a pistol to disperse a crowd, injuring a photojournalist.\n\nPolice spokesman Gary Desrosiers said four people were shot to death in demonstrations between Sept. 16 and Sept. 25.", "description": "Haitian police used tear gas and live ammunition on Friday to disperse increasingly violent protesters in the capital, witnesses said, as anger over the economic and political problems in the country grew.", "authors": ["Andre Paultre", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434689762&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1YR", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
