The report gave further ammunition to critics who accuse Boeing of cutting corners on safety in their rush to launch the MAX to compete with a rival Airbus plane.\n\n\"I think it is a good idea to separate the CEO duties to allow a high ranking independent official to manage health and safety concerns,\" said Arthur Wheaton, an expert in aerospace industrial relations at Cornell University.\n\n\"That does not mean the move will be sufficient to save the CEO job once the 737 MAX situation is resolved,\" Wheaton said. \"It may help Boeing buy some time.\"\n\nOne outcome might be for Muilenburg to stay to see through the MAX's return and then exit to give the company a \"fresh start\" under a different leader, Wheaton said.\n\nMichel Merluzeau at AirInsight Research said it would be best if Muilenburg saw the MAX return to service to avoid destabilizing operations and denting morale.\n\n- High-profile hearing -\n\nThe chief executive since 2015, Muilenburg has been the public face of the company as it has navigated one of the toughest periods in company history.\n\nBoeing has been under scrutiny since the Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October, but the situation intensified after the March crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet led to the MAX's global grounding.\n\nMuilenburg's handling of the crisis has at times drawn criticism, as when he initially blamed pilots for the Lion Air crash and called US President Donald Trump after the Ethiopian crash to argue that the MAX should not be grounded, said Scott Hamilton of Leeham News.\n\nSince that time, Boeing's efforts to get the MAX approved by the FAA and global aviation bodies has been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nUnable to deliver new MAX planes to clients, Boeing in April slashed production of the MAX and said over the summer that it could be forced to further curtail or temporarily suspend production if the grounding drags on much longer.\n\nMuilenburg will update investors on this and other key questions when the company reports third-quarter results on October 23.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Muilenburg is scheduled to appear before Congress for the first time about the MAX on October 30.\n\nCharles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware, said the hearing offers little upside for Muilenburg.\n\n\"If it turns out well, there will still be calls for change,\" Elson said. \"They're going to be looking to criticize him no matter what he says.\n\n\"Even if he does well, it's not positive at all,\" Elson added.", "description": "The crisis over the 737 MAX that has tarnished Boeing's image has finally cost Dennis Muilenburg his title as chairman.
