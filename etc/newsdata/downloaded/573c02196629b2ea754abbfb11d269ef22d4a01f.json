And the 68-year-old even had a song to go with it.\n\n\"Float like a butterfly/Sting like a bee/It's time for voting NDP,\" the former NDP leader rapped in the video for Ed's Back!, which could be seen on his campaign's website.\n\nCarol MacIvor, a worker at Broadbent's Ottawa campaign office, said website hits had gone \"through the roof\" since the rap video had been posted a week earlier. (Canada Now/CBC Archives)\n\nThe video had originally been made by an independent production company for the CBC program This Hour Has 22 Minutes.\n\n\"But the Ed's Back! video never made it to air because of concerns it lacked balance,\" explained CBC reporter Danny Globerman.\n\nThe NDP campaign, however, was happy to use the video on its website, sending traffic \"through the roof,\" according to campaign worker Carol MacIvor.\n\n\"Reaction to it has been absolutely amazing.\"\n\nAccording to the Globe and Mail, the video had been downloaded from NDP websites 13,000 times in four days \u2014 almost as much as the party platform.\n\nConservative call-out\n\nIn the riding, Ottawa Centre, opponent Mike Murphy's Conservative campaign had a beef with Broadbent.\n\n\"The true market cost of that video is at a number significantly in excess of a campaign contribution limit,\" said Tom Thompson, a staffer for Conservative candidate Mike Murphy.
