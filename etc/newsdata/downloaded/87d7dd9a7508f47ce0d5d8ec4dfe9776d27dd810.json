The two sides also signed a number of multi-million-dollar investment contracts aerospace, culture, health, and technology sectors.\n\nThe visit comes as Putin mediates between two friendly countries, Turkey and Syria, following the former\u2019s decision to invade the latter. Last week, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a majority Syrian Kurdish coalition that Turkey considers a terrorist group, to ally with Syria\u2019s Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\n#WATCH: Part of the Russian anthem being played at Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh as #Russia's president Vladimir Putin visits #SaudiArabia and is received by King Salmanhttps://t.co/eI1LAM82wx pic.twitter.com/RrNGg0Tzh4 \u2014 Arab News (@arabnews) October 14, 2019\n\nThe meeting marked the strengthening relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia following years of cooperation in a bid to keep oil markets stable, despite being on different sides of regional conflicts in Syria and Yemen.
