I think any citizen would be concerned by that withdrawal.'\n\n'I have to live on \u00a350 a week' Suzanne Coulton, 64, claims she has to live on \u00a350 a week Suzanne Coulton, 64, had to sell her three-bedroom home in London because she couldn't take out her pension. Under the old rules, Mrs Coulton would have qualified for her state pension in 2015. But she will now have to wait until 2021. Instead she receives just \u00a350 a week in personal independence payment, a benefit that covers the extra costs of living with a long-term health condition. It means she has had to carry on working as a part-time teacher. Speaking outside the High Court yesterday, she said: 'Three years ago my husband got very ill. He couldn't get a job so I had to sell the house and move out of inner London to a tiny one-bed house in the country. 'I thought I'd get my pension but now I get only \u00a350 a week to live on. I get really bad asthma. 'Today's decision is deeply upsetting for all of us.'\n\nEarlier this year, Money Mail revealed how the Government publicised the changes in a series of baffling newspaper and magazine advertisements, featuring dogs and Monopoly boards, that appeared in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBut judges Lord Justice Irwin and Mrs Justice Whipple noted that the new pension laws did not include a provision to notify the affected women, and ministers were not legally required to do so.\n\nJoanne Welch, of the BackTo60 campaign, which supported the claimants, said the ruling was 'ridiculous'.\n\nShe added: 'They told people about the TV licence, but we don't need to know about our pensions? It's an egregious constitutional disregard not to tell anyone. No private pension provider would get away with it.'\n\nAnne Keen, 66, from Liverpool, co-founder of the Women Against State Pension Inequality campaign, said she found out about the changes 13 months before she had planned to retire aged 60.\n\nOutside court, she said: 'I'm absolutely appalled by today's decision. You can see, hear and feel the anger. This decision will result in more heartache and hardship for 1950s women.\n\n'I retired in 2013 and lost out on around \u00a320,000. Most of the women here today have lost close to \u00a350,000. It's a travesty.'\n\nCampaigners argue that women born during the 1950s took time out of work to care for children, were paid less than men and could not save as much in occupational pensions, so the change had hit them harder. Barbara Cowlard, 65, an administrator from Kent, said she was never allowed to join a work pension scheme despite paying 48 years of National Insurance contributions.\n\nShe said: 'I believe in equality. I believe we should work the same as men but the way it was done was wrong. They threw equality upon us when we were never equal.\n\n'None of us received letters, none of us were told how they were going to do it.'\n\nJane Shelby, 65, from London, said: 'I never received a letter and I still have not. I didn't find out until I was 63 and a half that I had an extra 18 months' sentence. I don't even remember how I found out. I just heard it somewhere, but not from the Government.\n\n'I should have got it at 60, then it was 64, now it is 66.'\n\nAfter the ruling, the claimants' barrister, Michael Mansfield QC, said many women born in the 1950s were now 'on the brink of survival'. Campaigners have vowed to 'fight on' and said they were considering an appeal\n\nBut the Department for Work and Pensions said it welcomed the High Court judgment\n\nThe judges said they were 'saddened by the stories contained in the claimants' evidence', but concluded that 'wider issues' about whether the Government's actions 'were right or wrong or good or bad were not for the court'.\n\nIn her submission to the court, Mrs Delve said she had thought she would start getting her state pension when she turned 60 last year. She only discovered she would not get it until she was 66 in 2015, after she overheard a conversation on the train to work.\n\nMarcia Willis Stewart, of law firm Birnberg Peirce, which represented the claimants, described the pension age changes as a 'substantial and far-reaching injustice' and said she was 'deeply disappointed' by the judgment.\n\nJon Greer, head of retirement policy at Quilter, said: 'It had been claimed that if the equalisation of state pension ages between men and women were to be reversed it could cost the Government in excess of \u00a3180 billion so... they will be very relieved.'\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions said it welcomed the High Court judgment.\n\nA spokesman said: 'It has always been our view that the changes we made to women's state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds.\n\n'The court decided that arguments the claimants were not given adequate notice of changes to the state pension age could not be upheld. This follows the extensive communications that DWP made to publicise these changes over many years.'", "description": "Those affected gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London today having lost out on up to \u00a350,000 each.
