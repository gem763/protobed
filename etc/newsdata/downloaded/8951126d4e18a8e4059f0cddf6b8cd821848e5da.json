We are calling on them to preserve unity and to show restraint,\" government spokesman Ali Rabiei told a news conference.\n\nThe unrest is the biggest security and political challenge for Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi\u00b4s government since it took power a year ago.\n\nClashes between police and anti-government protesters have revived fears of a new spiral of violence that could suck in influential militia groups and be exploited by Islamic State (IS).\n\nThe Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) - Iraq\u00b4s umbrella grouping of mostly Shi\u00b4ite Muslim paramilitaries backed by Iran - played an important role defeating IS and formally became part of the armed forces last year, reporting to the prime minister.\n\nSome Iranian officials have accused the United States and Israel of stoking the unrest in Iraq. A cleric said on Friday the unrest was planned by Tehran's longtime foes to disrupt a major annual Shi\u00b4ite Muslim pilgrimage planned to be held there this month.\n\nRabiei also said Iran would continue efforts to ease tensions in the Gulf by improving ties with its Gulf Arab neighbours.\n\nTensions between Iran and its regional allies have risen after attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities on Sept. 14 that Washington and Riyadh blamed on Tehran, raising fears that a direct confrontation could lead to a new war in the Middle East.\n\nTehran has denied any involvement in the assault, which Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement said it carried out.
