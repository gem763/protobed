It\u2019s unclear what policy solutions Mr. Trump will put forward, though he made reference to an \u201cindividual task force\u201d to deal with homeless people who are living in tents, under highways and in the streets.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let Los Angeles, San Francisco and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told reporters aboard on Air Force One.\n\nMr. Trump spoke on the topic en route to a lunch in Palo Alto that was slated to pull in $3 million ahead of his 2020 reelection bid. Later, a dinner hosted by real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer at his home in Beverly Hills was expected to haul in $5 million.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump is set to raise $3 million at a Los Angeles breakfast and $4 million at a lunch in San Diego.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tour of the Golden State will benefit his own campaign and the Republican National Committee, which is touting record-breaking hauls in an off-cycle year.\n\nThe RNC said it brought in $20 million in July, or nearly double its haul in July 2017, and says it\u2019s amassed nearly $118 million in this election cycle compared to the Democrats\u2019 $52 million.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is raising funds at an unprecedented rate, including massive support from small donors, proving that people are responding to the policies that have engineered the strong and still-growing economy,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u2019s communications director. \u201cCombined with equally historic fundraising at the RNC, President Trump and Republicans will enter 2020 with an enormous advantage.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump headed straight to California from New Mexico, where he rallied with supporters outside Albuquerque late Monday.\n\nHe is touring California even as he battles the state\u2019s liberal leaders on a number of fronts.\n\nHis administration is questioning the legality of California\u2019s pact with automakers Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW to increase fuel efficiency and cut emissions. The agreement effectively ignores Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to role back federal regulations that were crafted to combat climate change.\n\nThe administration is poised to revoke California\u2019s authority to set mileage standards and assert federal power over the issue on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe president has attacked California Democrats\u2019 over their stance on illegal immigration, particularly \u201csanctuary\u201d policies, and says local leaders have failed to address rampant homelessness.\n\nHe said people come to California, even from abroad, looking for \u201cprestige\u201d and are willing to \u201cpay tremendous taxes,\u201d only to find people living in tents and people living in the entranceways of their buildings.\n\n\u201cAnd they want to leave,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe people of San Francisco are fed up, and the people of Los Angeles are fed up. And we\u2019re looking at it, and we\u2019ll be doing something about it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
