Andrea Kramar, USA Today, USA TODAY\n\nWith rents rising in many U.S. cities and mortgage rates near historic lows, it\u2019s an enticing time for first-time homebuyers. After all, why pay more to the landlord when you can build equity in your own property?\n\nBut first-timers may encounter a number of obstacles, from financial to psychological. Eliot Fuchs, 31, describes buying his first home in Newark, New Jersey, a two-bedroom, two-bath condo, as \u201ca learning experience.\u201d\n\nOne of his early lessons came when he lost out to a higher bid after his first offer. That sparked a realization, says Fuchs, who works in corporate strategy for Prudential.\n\n\u201cYou're not going to necessarily get it just because you put down the asking price,\u201d he notes. \u201cSo if you want a competitive unit, like one in this building, you're probably going to have to pay more than the asking price.\u201d\n\nReal estate investing: Is buying a property right for you? Here are six tips\n\nWant to add a room to your house? How to transform your 3-season porch\n\nBrian Nielson, right, helped Eliot Fuchs land a condo in Newark, New Jersey, after seven months of searching and placing bids on various homes.

He says he and Nielson developed a plan for making second- and third-round bids, which prepared him for going above the asking price.\n\nThe condo, originally listed at $263,000, sold to Fuchs for $292,000.\n\n\u201cHaving done it all, I'm happy that I did it,\u201d Fuchs says.\n\nRead on to learn five tips shared by Fuchs and Nielson about the first-time home-buying experience.\n\nGet your mortgage preapproved\n\nA mortgage preapproval \u2013 when a bank determines how much you are qualified to borrow \u2013 will help buyers zero in on their price range, says Nielson, a Realtor with Keller Williams.\n\n\u201cYou want to make sure that you get preapproved before you start looking,\u201d Nielson says. \u201cThat paper tells you exactly how much you can afford per month.\u201d\n\nHaving preapproval shows sellers that you\u2019re serious about making an offer, Nielson adds. And it can help buyers move quickly once they find a home they love.\n\n\u201cSo when you do find something \u2013 \u2018Bang, I want this property, here's my offer, here's my preapproval\u2019 \u2013 the bank already knows about it and we can hit the ground running,\u201d he says.\n\nFuchs gives a tour of his new duplex which he bought for $292,000. (Photo: Andrea Kramar, USA Today)\n\nHunt for the right location\n\nFuchs knew he wanted to move from Manhattan to Newark, where his office is based, because it would mean a shorter commute and more affordable home prices.\n\nNielson showed him homes around Newark, a city of about 280,000 people close to New York City, helping Fuchs narrow his search to three neighborhoods that appealed to him for their amenities and locations.\n\n\u201cYou don't want to ever regret buying a place,\u201d Fuchs advises. \u201cCast a very wide net in the beginning ... and spend a lot of time just looking at different places.\u201d\n\nKnow what matters most: schools, size?\n\nIt\u2019s also important to know what you want in a home \u2013 and what you might be willing to give up. A homebuyer with children, for instance, might not want to budge on good schools. For other buyers, home size may be more important.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be in a better area with better schools, then we might have to switch around what it is you're looking for,\u201d Nielson says. \u201cSometimes you want a bigger house, but in the nice neighborhoods you might not get that.\u201d\n\nPrepare for a months-long process\n\nFuchs says he eventually found exactly what he wanted in his condo but cautions that finding the perfect home can require months of searching. \u201cThat's probably why it took like seven months to get it to find this place and get it,\u201d he notes.\n\nNielson notes that many of his clients find their dream homes within two months but adds that others take six months or longer.\n\n\u201cIt has to do with more of them not getting the offers accepted,\u201d he says of the longer searches. \u201cThe product is there. They just didn't feel that the product is worth the price tag.\u201d\n\nFuchs chose to buy in the business district of Newark because of its close proximity to his job. (Photo: Andrea Kramar, USA Today)\n\nUnderstand the closing process\n\nOnce a seller accepts your offer, the closing can occur in about 30 days, Nielson says \u2013 or even faster \u201cdepending on how fast your attorneys are, depending on how fast your bank is with everything else,\u201d he adds.\n\nMake sure to budget for closing costs, he says. \u201cClosing costs are everything outside of the down payment,\u201d such as attorneys, insurance and other expenses, he notes. Budget about 3% to 5% of the overall cost of the home on these expenses, he adds.\n\nLastly, Nielson says an agent will walk the buyer through the closing process, such as setting up an appointment with an inspector to examine the property.\n\n\u201cThe agent doesn't cost the buyer anything,\u201d he notes. \u201cIt costs the seller\u2019s agent. We help you negotiate the deals and we get the deals done quickly and as fast and as securely as possible.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/16/if-youre-buying-your-first-home-here-are-5-tips/3983461002/", "description": "With rents rising in many U.S. cities and mortgage rates near historic lows, it\u2019s an enticing time for first-time homebuyers.", "authors": ["Aimee Picchi", "Special To Usa Today", "Published A.M.
