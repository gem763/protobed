He said it was important that findings and remedial actions set out by it should be implemented because they were binding.\n\n\"She [Judge Sulet Potterill] must know that if she rules against us, we are petitioning the Constitutional Court directly. We want the Constitutional Court to once more say they don't care about this office.\"\n\nMalema said just because the party was supporting the Public Protector in this particular case should not mean it had never disagreed with her before.\n\nHe told his supporters the EFF welcomed Monday's ConCourt ruling, which found that Mkhwebane should pay 15% (an estimated R900 000) of the South African Reserve Bank's costs in her personal capacity for her Bankorp-CIEX report that was set aside in February 2017.\n\nMalema said the party had warned her against releasing the report.\n\nALSO READ: ConCourt ruling on Public Protector must be dealt with on own merits, says EFF\n\nHe reiterated it was important that remedial actions set out by the Public Protector should be implemented, adding if they were not, then the office was being disregarded.\n\nMalema said it had brought its case to court, supporting the office, because the \"Constitution was violated\". He added remedial actions needed to be taken by way of Ramaphosa \"disciplining\" Gordhan.\n\n\"Discipline means a simple thing, he [Gordhan] must be fired. Pravin doesn't deserve to be a minister.\n\n\"Pravin Gordhan behaves like an untouchable politician in South Africa. So the EFF goes after the untouchables, once you create an impression that no one can touch you, we come after you. No one must be above the Constitution and the courts. Our courts must interpret the law,\" he said.\n\nHe said the party had nothing against Gordhan but was concerned because there were findings against him, adding there was nothing about the party \"flip-flopping\" because it was a matter of principle.\n\n\"We supported Pravin when Zuma fired him. When we were supporting him, there was no finding by the Public Protector.\"\n\nWe are not friends with white monopoly capital\n\nMalema also touched on allegations that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, had a relationship with one of South Africa's richest men, Johann Rupert.\n\nHe said his party was continuing the fight against white monopoly capital, adding it would continue to fight against those who had the wealth and land they acquired under apartheid.\n\n\"We are not friends with white monopoly capital. We don't want the Ruperts. They can donate their books and say our deputy president is working with them. They can't prove anything because they want to use our deputy president to avoid accountability for Ramaphosa and Gordhan,\" said Malema.\n\nJudgment in Gordhan's urgent application has been reserved.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
