Unless you have been affected by knife crime you cannot understand the heartbreak.\n\n'You cannot imagine how it feels knowing that you can't touch your child because he is a piece of forensic evidence.\n\n'My boy, who I protected for 17 years and watched him grow into a loving, beautiful and intelligent young man, was never going to walk into my room again.\n\n'Imagine as a parent knowing you would never see him graduate or have kids of his own or even talk to me again, as he often did.\n\n'We are completely broken, all we can try and do is change things for our other children.'\n\n'Gentle giant' Yousef, who was 6ft 3ins tall, dreamed of becoming a heart surgeon and, hailing from Burnage, Stockport, was awarded a full bursary to Manchester Grammar aged 11\n\nIn her statement, Debbie also called for changes to the criminal justice system and for children to be taught knife crime is unacceptable.\n\nShe added: 'We need to teach children this is not acceptable in our society and make them fear the justice system, not mock it.\n\n'Every life is precious no matter where you come from or how much money you earn.

The trial has been complete devastation.\n\n'I have another son at home who is struggling and I have to concentrate on him, but I can't because all I do when I wake up is think about this.\n\n'It feels like he didn't exist - it's like I had a dream for 17 years, what did his life mean?'\n\nJoshua Molnar, 18, was cleared of the murder despite admitting to stabbing Makki after an argument in the upmarket village in Cheshire, on March 2.\n\nMolnar was sentenced to a 16-month detention training order \u2013 12 months for perverting the course of justice, and four months for possession of the knife.\n\nHe was revealed as a white Anglo-Hungarian with mild learning difficulties from a well-off family in the village of Hale.\n\nMolnar had been at one time a pupil at Ellesmere College, a \u00a333,000-a-year boarding school in Shropshire, where Latin is still taught and its alumni include former England rugby union captain Bill Beaumont, the current chairman of World Rugby, and Hugh Grosvenor, the seventh Duke of Westminster.", "description": "Debbie Makki delivered the powerful speech in memory of her son, 17, who was knifed to death in March - at a public anti-knife crime event at Manchester Cathedral on Tuesday evening.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/14/19788718-0-image-a-10_1571232468116.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
