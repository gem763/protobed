Cunningham jots down her responsibilities and allots a percentage to each, giving her a rough guide to how she should be spending her day.\n\n\"It's easy to become reactive and focus on tasks that are actively demanding my attention,\" Cunningham told Business Insider. \"The card serves as a touchstone to confirm I haven't strayed too far off track.\" She said she would periodically check the card to see how well she's sticking to her plan, adjusting as needed.\n\nCunningham's approach is somewhere in between those advocated by two of the internet's biggest productivity gurus, the podcaster and \"4-Hour Workweek\" author Tim Ferriss and the Georgetown associate professor and \"Digital Minimalism\" author Cal Newport. Ferriss recommends writing three top priorities for a day on a Post-it note as a reminder that just a few tasks outweigh everything else likely to pop up in a day, while Newport is obsessive about assigning specific time frames to each of the day's tasks.\n\nAs the leader of an organization that isn't always predictable, Cunningham ranks her priorities without getting into minute-by-minute breakdowns.\n\nHer responsibilities include competing for the biggest initial public offerings of the year by persuading companies to list on the NYSE, as opposed to competitors like the Nasdaq, fostering relationships with existing clients, and overseeing the development of new market data and trading software to maintain an edge.\n\nRead more: 100 people transforming business\n\nAnd since she's charged not just with managing her own time but also the priorities of her team, Cunningham added that she took a similar scheduling approach to the way she divided responsibilities, according to skill sets. \"Given our need to divide and conquer in order to scale, I put tremendous emphasis on team composition,\" she said. Similar to how she breaks down a day into slices meant to ensure she gets everything done with the proper amount of effort, she views teams as having a set of required skills and compiles a group that collectively meets all of them.\n\nShe said she'd built this into the way the NYSE hired.\n\n\"By building the right talent pool and then effectively allocating our resources, we are equipped to think creatively and strategically and execute efficiently and flawlessly,\" Cunningham said.", "description": "Stacey Cunningham has made high tech the focus at the New York Stock Exchange, but she uses an especially low-tech technique for managing her time.", "authors": ["Allana Akhtar", "Richard Feloni"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7173372e22af10ee07d7b2-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
