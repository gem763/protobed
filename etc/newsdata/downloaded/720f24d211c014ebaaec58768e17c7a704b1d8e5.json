One of the questions asked by left-wing critics of the Times\u2019s Kavanaugh story is why it was shunted off into the Sunday Review section, which is edited by the paper\u2019s opinion staff, instead of receiving a splashy treatment in the news section befitting the gravity of a new sexual-misconduct claim against a Supreme Court justice. The Times\u2019s deputy opinion page editor, James Dao, offered a \u201cneutral\u201d explanation for that decision: The Sunday Review section is typically the section where the paper publishes \u201cexcerpts or adaptations from books.\u201d The new reporting on Kavanaugh comes from a new book. Simple as that.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what \u201cpeople familiar with how things went down\u201d told Vanity Fair. Supposedly the news section *did* have first crack at the new claim about a woman\u2019s hand being placed on Kavanaugh\u2019s dong during a party at Yale when the two were students.\n\nThey passed. Why?\n\nWhy did the Kavanaugh excerpt end up in the Review? People familiar with how things went down told me that Kelly and Pogrebin initially pitched their scoop to the news side, but the top editors ultimately felt that there wasn\u2019t enough juice to warrant a story there, let alone a big page-one treatment (the type many lefties would have been salivating for). Instead, Pogrebin and Kelly were told that they could pitch the Review, which is entirely independent of the News department. I asked for clarification as to what about the story wasn\u2019t News-pages-worthy, but the Times declined to comment, as did Kelly and Pogrebin. (A Times spokesperson did, however, point out that \u201cit\u2019s not unusual for Opinion or Sunday Review pieces to break news.\u201d) I got mixed reactions from insiders as to whether the Times made the right call. Some agree that the new material, as presented in the book, wasn\u2019t earth-shattering, especially since the anonymous woman at the center of the alleged penis-thrusting incident claims to not remember it. (In a related story, the Washington Post revealed on Monday that it \u201cdid not publish a story\u201d about the incident last year \u201cin part because the intermediaries declined to identify the alleged witness and because the woman who was said to be involved declined to comment.\u201d) Others feel that if a piece of reporting meets the standards of the Review, then it should meet the standards of the News department, and vice versa. Still others find it surprising that newsroom brass didn\u2019t want what Pogrebin and Kelly were offering. Summing up the internal vibe on this overall, one source said, \u201cThe most charitable read is that the Times sometimes twists itself in knots with weird internal rules and traditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough juice to warrant a story\u201d is an odd thing to say about a scoop of this magnitude, presuming that \u201cjuice\u201d means buzzworthiness. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what it means in context. \u201cJuice\u201d here means credibility: Of course the Times\u2019s news section would have loved to showcase a new allegation about fratty Brett Kavanaugh finding comedy in sexually assaulting a classmate, but there just wasn\u2019t enough by way of evidence to meet the section\u2019s standards for publication. How could there have been when the supposed victim herself doesn\u2019t remember it happening?\n\nBut there was enough for the Sunday Review section, strangely. \u201cI seriously don\u2019t get this new standard where reporters think passing on second- or third-hand hearsay, or campus legend, is suddenly OK,\u201d tweeted NRO\u2019s Kyle Smith this morning. It isn\u2019t okay! \u2014 for the news division. It\u2019s fine for opinion, apparently. If you vaguely remember something that may or may not have happened when you were in college and may or may not have involved Brett Kavanaugh and isn\u2019t actually corroborated by the alleged victim, we can\u2019t call that a \u201cfact\u201d\u2026\n\n\u2026but I suppose we could call it an \u201copinion.\u201d That\u2019s good enough for the paper of record, it seems. Which reminds me of a question I asked yesterday: Has the *print edition* of the Times acknowledged any problems with its Kavanaugh story yet? They added that \u201ceditor\u2019s note\u201d to the online version but as I write this at 11 a.m. ET on Tuesday I\u2019m unaware of any print correction or retraction or follow-up story that delves into the controversy about the piece. Print readers presumably remain completely in the dark that there\u2019s any problem with the article.\n\nIn fact, the little Q&A feature I linked up top in which Dao answered questions about the story somehow avoids answering the most burning question about it. Why was it never mentioned that the alleged victim of the newly reported assault by Kavanaugh doesn\u2019t remember it happening? Here\u2019s as close as Dao gets to responding:\n\nSome readers have argued that the latest accusation against Mr. Kavanaugh was too weak to appear in The Times. Given that the woman who was said to be involved in the incident refused to be interviewed, and her friends have said she doesn\u2019t remember what happened, why did you include that accusation in the essay? DAO: The essay included a previously unreported claim that friends pushed Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into the hand of a female Yale student during a dorm party with drunken classmates. During the authors\u2019 investigation, they learned that a classmate, Max Stier, witnessed the event and later reported it to senators and to the F.B.I. The authors corroborated his story with two government officials, who said they found it credible. Based on that corroboration, we felt mentioning the claim as one part of a broader essay was warranted.\n\nThat\u2019s a defense of why Stier\u2019s claim was included in the piece, not an explanation for why the alleged victim\u2019s denial wasn\u2019t included. As we now know from the authors of the piece, the denial *was* included originally. The paper\u2019s editors took it out. Why? Radio silence from Dao.\n\nI strongly recommend reading that entire Q&A, by the way, just to see the bias on display *even while the paper is trying to clean up its earlier bias.* Of the five questions posed there about the Kavanaugh piece, only one \u2014 the one I just quoted \u2014 has to do with the paper being unfair to Kavanaugh by running unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct. Of the other four, three are basically left-wing complaints that the paper should have done more to promote the smear and the fourth has to do with the weird phrasing of a tweet the paper sent while promoting it.\n\nJust to put a cherry on top here, it turns out that the authors of the book that inspired the Times story on Kavanaugh never actually spoke to Stier himself about the bombshell allegation. They\u2019ve confirmed \u2014 I think? \u2014 that Stier *did* make this accusation last year, but they weren\u2019t able to grill him about the details or personally test his credibility.\n\nMax Stier refused to talk to authors of new anti-Kavanaugh book.

When the authors were interviewed again this morning on CNN, however, they were cagier about whether they\u2019d spoken to Stier \u2014 as if not wanting to further undermine their reporting by forthrightly admitting that they haven\u2019t spoken to the key witness for their new bombshell allegation against Kavanaugh. (Whom, by the way, they also fail to note was a Clinton defense lawyer with a possible partisan motive in accusing Kavanaugh.) How many more layers of shadiness can be piled onto this incident?", "description": "\"he Times sometimes twists itself in knots with weird internal rules and traditions.\u201d", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/k-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
