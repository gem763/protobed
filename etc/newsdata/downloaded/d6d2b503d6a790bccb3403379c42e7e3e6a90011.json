We will come out on 31 October and we will get it done,\u201d Johnson told the Mail on Sunday.\n\nBut Ruffalo tweeted in response that \u201cthe Hulk works best when he is in unison with a team\u201d, and that his rage is counter-balanced by the \u201cscience and reason\u201d of his alter-ego, the mild-mannered Dr Bruce Banner.\n\nMark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) Boris Johnson forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of the whole. Mad and strong can also be dense and destructive. The Hulk works best when he is in unison with a team, and is a disaster when he is alone. Plus...he\u2019s always got Dr. Banner with science and reason. pic.twitter.com/jN8BDzgpWl\n\nIn his interview Johnson stressed his willingness to defy the Commons vote for a delay in the event of negotiations with the EU breaking down, saying: \u201cThe madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.\u201d\n\nHis comments drew widespread derision online while Ruffalo\u2019s post prompted an outpouring of colourful memes, with Marvel-themed satire ranging from subversive takes on well-known Avengers quotes and scenes to concern for Johnson\u2019s collection of hand-made model buses, to comparisons with the time he knocked over a 10-year-old while playing rugby in Japan.\n\nGeneral Boles (@GeneralBoles) \"what were you NOT meant to do?\"\n\n\"SMASH CONSTITUTION\"\n\n\"and what did you do\"\n\n\"SMASHED CONSTITUTION\" pic.twitter.com/kdK0CZ72lV\n\nDickleDockle \ud83d\udd36#FBPE #PVWOTR (@DickleDockle) Don\u2019t hold much hope out for Johnson\u2019s model bus collection pic.twitter.com/LEd3ov7wYo\n\nColinTheWarriorMonkey (@CTWarriorMonkey) HULK SMAAAASHHH !!!!!! pic.twitter.com/td4qBpSMLP\n\nHappyToast \u2605 (@IamHappyToast) Good work pic.twitter.com/CTJ6lOfQb1\n\nFormer Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell commented that \u201cif Ruffalo was a town, Johnson just got run out of it\u201d, while Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley Jess Phillips said: \u201cThis is the kind of thing my kids would say aside from they would never make such glaring errors about The Hulk, I\u2019ve raised them properly.\u201d\n\nOthers appeared to look more fondly on the PM\u2019s choice of description, making their own foray into cinematic metaphor.\n\nBrexit secretary Steve Barclay told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge earlier on Sunday: \u201cThe Hulk was a winner and was extremely popular. I\u2019d rather be backing a character and a leader who is The Hulk than one who is on the \u2018Chicken Run\u2019, as Jeremy Corbyn is.\u201d", "description": "Mark Ruffalo pointed out that the Marvel character only fights for the good of the whole", "authors": ["Will Neal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d7e4fa0cd7f61fa03bfc93141df0e6bf5ec8922/605_0_1497_898/master/1497.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=07fe2f6ca4fcfcbbd956386815c65271", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
