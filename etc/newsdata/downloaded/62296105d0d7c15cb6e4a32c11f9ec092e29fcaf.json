REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n\nMOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that Washington would need Russian consent to publish transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.\n\nCongress is determined to get access to Trump\u2019s calls with Putin and other world leaders, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee\u2019s chairman said on Sunday, citing concerns that the Republican president may have jeopardized national security.\n\nAsked about those comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Russia would be prepared to discuss the issue with Washington if it sent Moscow a signal, but that such disclosures were not normal diplomatic practice.\n\n\u201cOf course their publication is to some extent only possible by mutual agreement of the parties. This is a certain diplomatic practice,\u201d Peskov said.\n\n\u201cTo be more specific, perhaps, diplomatic practice in general does not envisage their publication. If there are some signals from the Americans, then we will discuss (them).\u201d\n\nThe Democratic-led House last week launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump in the aftermath of a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump had solicited interference by Ukraine in the 2020 U.S. election for his own political benefit.\n\nThe White House released a memo summarizing Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy after the allegations set off a U.S. domestic political storm.", "description": "The Kremlin said on Monday that Washington would need Russian consent to publish transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435535358&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0WW", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
