But reporters were removed from the event before the audience was allowed to ask questions.\n\nThe GOP leader also skipped taking questions reporters this week when speaking at a Federalist Society meeting in Kentucky, as well as a separate event with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar touting a grant for the University of Kentucky.\n\nAsked about McConnell\u2019s thinking and why he\u2019s decided not to weigh in directly on Trump\u2019s calls for Ukraine and China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenFederal prosecutors investigating Giuliani: report Trump lashes out at 2020 Dems, impeachment inquiry In marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump MORE, a spokesman declined to comment beyond what McConnell has said on the record.\n\nThe relative silence from McConnell \u2014 known for being a cautious but sharp strategist \u2014 comes as Republican senators dispersed across the country have offered different views on Trump.\n\nMcConnell told Politico last month that Democratic criticism of a partial transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukranian President Zelensky was \u201claughable,\u201d but he\u2019s offered no public comment since then directly responding to Trump\u2019s suggestions of investigations by Ukraine. He also hasn\u2019t weighed in on reports suggesting top administration and Cabinet officials are involved in the decision to temporarily block Ukraine aid.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell has learned there is no point in weighing in on every story,\u201d GOP strategist Ford O\u2019Connell said in a discussion on McConnell\u2019s actions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHouse Democrats are at the start of an impeachment inquiry centered on Trump's dealings with Ukraine, including a request that the Ukrainian government work with the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiFederal prosecutors investigating Giuliani: report In marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump Arrested Giuliani associate attended Trump's invite-only 2016 election night party: report MORE, to investigate the Bidens. Two men who allegedly aided Giuliani\u2019s efforts to investigate Biden were arrested on campaign finance violation charges on Wednesday.\n\nThey are also probing allegations that the president tried to withhold aid to Ukraine in an effort to get Kiev to launch such a probe.\n\nMcConnell has been more comfortable taking shots at Democrats over their impeachment inquiry.\n\nHis campaign began Facebook ads shortly after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiTrump lashes out at 2020 Dems, impeachment inquiry In marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump Trump accuses Pelosi of 'hating' US over impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Calif.) formally announced an impeachment inquiry painting himself, and the GOP Senate, as a roadblock to removing Trump from office.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s in the clutches of a left wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president. All of you know your Constitution, the way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader,\u201d McConnell said in the ad.\n\nMcConnell does not mention the allegations surrounding the president's communication with Ukraine in the video.\n\nDuring his Federalist Society speech he compared the fight over impeachment to the battle to confirm Trump\u2019s judicial picks, saying \u201csome people think of it as a judicial-type proceeding. It's a political decision.\u201d\n\nAnd he knocked Democrats in a statement after the White House warned that it would not cooperate with the impeachment probe unless Pelosi holds a formal vote on the floor to open the inquiry. Democrats argue the vote isn\u2019t required.\n\n\u201cSo far, the House has fallen far short by failing to follow the same basic procedures that it has followed for every other President in our history,\u201d he said in a statement that did not directly mention impeachment or the White House strategy.\n\nThe willingness to weigh in on impeachment, but not on Trump\u2019s request for a Biden probe, comes as Republicans voters are still overwhelmingly opposed on efforts to remove Trump from office, despite growing support among voters overall.\n\nA Fox News poll released this week found that 51 percent supporting impeaching Trump. By comparison, according to the same poll, only 13 percent of Republicans support removing from office.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s relative silence could reflect the fact that his conference is at least somewhat divided on how to handle questions about Trump\u2019s conduct. The Senate would also have to act as a jury in an impeachment trial.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to ever get ahead of the conference, and he always wants to be in a place that\u2019s helpful to both ends. ... And look he\u2019s obviously very much attuned to the risk that some of those incumbents face and he doesn\u2019t want to make their job harder. On the other hand, he also knows the facts are developing,\u201d said GOP strategist Matt Mackowiak.\n\nIn one corner of the caucus McConnell has senators like Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman and top Republican to introduce sanctions bill against Turkey US troops in Syria come under Turkish artillery fire Trump to meet Italian president at White House next week MORE (R-S.C.) who has quickly become one of Trump\u2019s fiercest defenders, including threatening to use his panel to launch a counter investigation.\n\nBut McConnell is also contending with a growing number of senators, including Sens.

The Senate Intelligence Committee is having an investigation, a bipartisan investigation, unfortunately what we\u2019ve seen is a very political process take over,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nWhen a reporter pushed back that is was a \u201cyes or no question,\u201d Gardner pivoted, adding \u201chere\u2019s what we see in the House of Representatives you see a very partisan process taking place.\u201d\n\nThe dissonance among Senate Republicans \u2014 a large swath of whom, mirroring McConnell, haven\u2019t weighed in during the break \u2014 reflects a larger struggle within the party to unify behind a single strategy.\n\nMackowiak argued that the White House needs an impeachment \u201cwar room,\u201d that would be responsible for sending out messaging guidance to allies and lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have all the facts,\u201d he said, referring to Senate Republicans. \u201cClearly the White House messaging has been pretty uneven. ... That can be a little risky to be unequivocal or get out on a limb and have the limb sawed off.\u201d", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is keeping a low profile amid the growing impeachment battle", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mcconnellmitch_091119gn2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
