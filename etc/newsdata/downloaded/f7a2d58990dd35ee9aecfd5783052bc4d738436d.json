I am really happy with the players. The last two, three, four weeks, every player - and Mesut Ozil - is working very well.\n\n(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\n\"This is why we can be positive and we can think we are going to do something important this year. I was speaking with Raul and this is the same idea when he is speaking with me.\"\n\nA feather in Emery's cap is his use of young, English players with Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Rob Holding, Calum Chambers, Reiss Nelson, Joe Willock, Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka all handed opportunities since the Spaniard took over in the summer of 2018.\n\nHe believes they are a key part of the process which will see the Gunners return to the upper echelons of the table and challenging for the title again.\n\n\"We can play better each match. It's one process. Little by little we're using the young players to achieve the performance, giving them confidence and experience in the matches,\" Emery added.\n\n\"For example, Bukayo Saka is improving, helping us and taking a good performance. I know he needs to break more steps ahead in his improvement. Other players are the same.\n\n\"This is the way he can give us the best performance and best way to do our way, playing maybe better sometimes. I think this is one process.\n\n\"For us it's very important to be competitive each match. We are being competitive at the moment. Being competitive we can then achieve a better way for how we can play.\n\n\"If we are competitive we can use different players in different moments, some with more skill, some with more capacity to do pressing and transition. We can use them if we, like a team, can feel strong in our mentality and being competitive and consistent each match.\"\n\nArsenal likely XI: Leno; Chambers, Sokratis, Holding, Tierney; Guendouzi, Torreira, Ceballos; Pepe, Aubameyang, Saka", "description": "Arsenal face Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on Monday night in the Premier League", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662156.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
