It is currently the planet\u2019s third-largest crypto economy, after the United States and Japan.\n\nCointelegraph traveled to Korea to meet a new generation of crypto entrepreneurs who are building the future of blockchain. Among the people we talked to were representatives of established firms \u2014 such as crypto investment funds Hashed and Kakao\u2019s blockchain subsidiary GroundX \u2014 but also common Korean investors who still see Bitcoin as a path toward a better life.\n\nDespite strict regulation on initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges, South Korean authorities are also helping the crypto industry and implementing blockchain technology in the public sector. For instance, the city of Busan, Korea\u2019s second-largest city, is creating a local digital currency that will be used in people\u2019s everyday life.\n\nEven though it is fertile ground for crypto entrepreneurship, the Korean market is very competitive: as popular Korean blogger Spunky told Cointelegraph, the overwhelming majority of crypto startups are bound to fail. Only the most daring entrepreneurs offering the best use cases will emerge.\n\nGiven the size of Korea\u2019s crypto economy, it is only natural that Cointelegraph opened a new representative office in Seoul.
