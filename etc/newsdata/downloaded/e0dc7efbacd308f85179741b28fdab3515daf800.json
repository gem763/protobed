What is its appeal \u2013 and is it safe?\n\nRoblox may not be as famous a children\u2019s game as Fortnite or Minecraft, but it recently announced that it has more than 100 million active monthly players.\n\nIt has flown more under the media radar than those rivals, leaving parents whose children are now asking to play it (or playing it without asking) in need of a primer.\n\nWhat is Roblox?\n\nIt\u2019s not a single game, but rather a collection of more than 50m games, all created by its community of players. The simplest comparison is to YouTube: a huge library of \u201cuser-generated content\u201d, but in this case the content is games rather than videos.\n\nChildren (and adults) download the Roblox application for computers, games consoles, smartphones or tablets and use it to browse and play its catalogue of games. Social features are also key to its appeal, including the ability to add friends and chat to them while playing.\n\nRoblox isn\u2019t a new thing: it officially launched in 2006, and has been growing steadily ever since.\n\nHow many children play it?\n\nRoblox doesn\u2019t split its 100 million figure between children and adults, though it does say that 40% of them are women and girls.\n\nIn the UK alone, there are around 1.5 million children playing Roblox, according to research firm Kids Insights. Its data, based on an annual survey of 20,000 British children, suggests that 24% of 10- to 12-year-olds here are on Roblox \u2013 more than on TikTok (13%) and Snapchat (20%) and nearly as popular as Instagram (25%).\n\nThe company adds that 19% of seven-to-nine-year-olds in the UK are playing Roblox, some way behind YouTube (43%) but ahead of TV brands like CBBC (11%), Nickelodeon (10%) and Cartoon Network (8%).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Work at a Pizza Place by Dued1 \u2013 teams of players fill orders and earn credits to buy home furnishings. Photograph: Roblox\n\nWhy is Roblox popular?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a company that does a lot of marketing. The No 1 way that someone finds out about our platform is they get invited to play by a friend. And the second way is they\u2019ll watch people playing on YouTube,\u201d says Roblox\u2019s chief business officer Craig Donato. \u201cSo it\u2019s very much an organic phenomenon.\u201d\n\nHe also suggests that one reason for Roblox\u2019s popularity is its emphasis on \u201cunstructured play\u201d in an era when many children are more restricted in their physical-world activities than previous generations were.\n\n\u201cWhen I came home from school, I\u2019d get on my bike, go out in the woods, do pick-up baseball. But we live in a world today where it\u2019s hard for kids to go out and have unstructured play with their friends,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the experiences on our platform aren\u2019t just about the object to win. It\u2019s an experience you have with other people: a shared experience.\u201d\n\nHow do people make games for it?\n\nAnyone can make a game (or \u201cexperience\u201d \u2013 they can simply be virtual spaces) for Roblox by downloading its separate Roblox Studio software. The company says that it has more than 2 million \u201ccreators\u201d \u2013 so around 2% of its players \u2013 with the most popular games being played by up to 100,000 people simultaneously.\n\nFor many children, creating a simple game or virtual room where they can hang out with friends is the limit of their ambitions, but others build bigger, more complex games, and even start to make money through taking a cut of in-game purchases using Roblox\u2019s virtual currency, Robux. The company expects to pay out more than $100m in 2019 alone to them.\n\n\u201cWe have these teams forming businesses, and making millions of dollars a year,\u201d says Donato. Roblox is keen to foster this community: in 2018 it launched its own curriculum, available under a Creative Commons licence, for educators to use. Donato says it reached more than 500,000 children in its first year.\n\nAre people really making businesses out of this?\n\nThey are. Josh Wood is one of the British Roblox game-makers. He\u2019s 18 now, but discovered Roblox in 2013, and started to make his own games for it a year later.\n\n\u201cFrom there I continued to learn and collaborate with other people on projects until I released my most successful game to date, Game Dev Life, which has so far had over a million play sessions,\u201d he says.\n\nWood has now set up his own company to make games for Roblox, hiring other developers, artists and testers, and even launching a line of toys based on Game Dev Life, in partnership with Roblox.\n\n\u201cWith the money from my games I have been able to pay for my university education, and continue to reinvest in my business,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother young British developer working on Roblox games is Abbie Leigh. Now aged 19, she started playing Roblox in 2011, but took the leap into development in 2017, initially creating assets for other people\u2019s games. She\u2019s currently working on three games, including her own sports-themed title, and hopes to make a full-time career out of freelance development.\n\n\u201cIt never feels like a job, which of course is the best part. I enjoy building and do so in my free time, and I\u2019m simply rewarded when it comes to doing what I love.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Game Dev Life by DoubleJGames.

The company says that it has been working hard to tackle wrongdoers and fix any loopholes in its platform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not defensive if things have ever gone wrong. We hold our hands up and say, \u2018This is what we\u2019ve done to fix it, and this is what we\u2019re doing to make sure it never happens again,\u2019\u201d says Laura Higgins, a British child-safety veteran hired by Roblox in January 2019 as its \u2018director of digital civility\u2019. Her job is to learn from those problems and prevent activities that could harm young players.\n\n\u201cWe really do start with safety as our No 1 priority. We acknowledge that we have younger players, so you have to be as ahead of the game as possible in terms of safety,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an age-old thing: if people have bad intentions towards children, they\u2019re going to gravitate towards where the children are. We\u2019re constantly reviewing the tools that we have, and looking at ways to improve them.\u201d\n\nHow can parents keep informed about it?\n\nAnother measure taken by Roblox is to launch a section of its website called For Parents, which explains its safety tools \u2013 from algorithms blocking swearwords and names and addresses in text chats, to its reporting system for inappropriate chat or content. There\u2019s even an algorithm detecting whether players\u2019 avatars are wearing \u201cappropriate attire\u201d.\n\nHiggins admits that parents can get \u201cvery frustrated\u201d when there\u2019s a horror story around safety on a children\u2019s platform like Roblox: \u201cYou think, how hard can it be? [to stop these things happening],\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very hard, is the answer. When things go wrong, it\u2019s because somebody is trying very hard to break your systems.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s keen to make sure that parents also see the positive side of the games that children are creating on Roblox, citing the example of a game made by a teenager whose father had recently died.\n\n\u201cHe developed a game around managing mental wellbeing, mental health, as a journey for other young people experiencing those kinds of issues,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an amazing outlet for him, but it also helped many young people who played it, and were able to explore their emotions.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an aspect also highlighted by developer Abbie Leigh. \u201cI absolutely love the developer community as a whole. We all stick together, support each other\u2019s creations and help each other when we need it the most,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom feedback on games, to personal issues.\u201d\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
