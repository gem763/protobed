Cook was on hand to accept GLSEN\u2019s Champion Award in recognition of his \u201congoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ rights and creating safe spaces for members of the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nFittingly, Cook shared messages he\u2019d received from people from around the world who\u2019d thanked him after he opened up about his sexuality for the first time publicly in a 2014 essay published by Bloomberg Businessweek.\n\n\u201cIt was my hope that pulling back that curtain on my own private life would help someone, anyone out there,\u201d he told the star-studded crowd, which included \u201cMean Girls\u201d actor Jonathan Bennett and another one of the night\u2019s honorees, Octavia Spencer. \u201cI truly did not expect the response I received in the days, weeks and years that followed.\u201d\n\nOne such note, Cook explained, came from a 62-year-old closeted gay man who has been married to a woman for 28 years and \u201crepressed, suppressed [and] denied\u201d his true self.\n\n\u201cI fought acknowledging who I was because it was not the way things should be,\u201d he said, reading from the man\u2019s letter. \u201cIt makes me happy to know that there are others who are struggling who will give up the struggle and not travel the road that I chose.\u201d\n\nDedicating his award to the man who\u2019d written the letter, Cook added, \u201cI trust that the world is a better, more honest, and more beautiful place when we have every opportunity to be ourselves.\u201d\n\nPrior to the Oct. 25 ceremony, the tech impresario spoke at length about coming out in an interview with People en Espa\u00f1ol, excerpts of which appeared in English on People\u2019s website.\n\nCook told journalist Armando Correa this week that he\u2019s proud to have made history as the first leader of a Fortune 500 company to publicly identify as gay. He went on to note that there were \u201cmany meanings\u201d behind his decision to speak out.\n\n\u201cIt gives me a level of empathy that I think is probably much higher than average because being gay or trans, you\u2019re a minority,\u201d Cook said. \u201cBeing gay is not a limitation. It\u2019s a feature.\u201d\n\nBy going public, Cook said he was hopeful he could help set an example for parents who may be struggling to come to terms with an LGBTQ child\u2019s sexuality or gender identity.\n\n\u201cSome parents \u2014 I know because they\u2019ve reached out to me \u2014 some parents struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cMy message to them is that it doesn\u2019t have to be like that.\u201d", "description": "The tech impresario was honored for his LGBTQ advocacy work at the 2019 GLSEN Respect Awards in Los Angeles.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db73bf7200000a72850707b.jpeg?cache=idtqptmgav&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
