The political dynamic gets reduced to neat binaries\u2014the forces there are either pro-Russia or pro-West; leaders are either corrupt actors or laudable reformers; the good guys versus the bad guys. But that framework belies the moral complexity of the place, which is why it pops up in our domestic political scandals in the first place.\n\nOne main reason for Ukraine's outsize presence in our news cycles is money: There\u2019s a lot of it sloshing around, and, as the ladies selling at the designer store know, it tends to find its way into all kinds of crevices.\n\nUkraine would like America and Europe to think of it as a promising young democracy, the good little country struggling to fend off the gravitational pull of evil Russia. There is a lot of truth in that. But it is also an oligarchy where a very small number of people control the country\u2019s natural resources, a legacy of its Soviet past. Around each of these people is a clan vying for influence, resources, and political power. They sponsor media outlets and politicians. Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for example, has promised to fight corruption but is also closely linked with one of the country\u2019s most powerful oligarchs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pay-to-play democracy, or has been in the past,\u201d says Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who was Obama\u2019s last assistant secretary of state for human rights, democracy, and labor. \u201cAt its most corrupt, you can get very rich, but you need permission to get very rich, so politicians and oligarchs are linked in all kinds of ways. In some ways, it\u2019s very similar to Russia. But Ukraine is a country where you\u2019re more likely to get rich without getting killed if you\u2019re a Western businessman or political consultant.\u201d\n\nIndeed, plenty of American political operatives find there\u2019s a lucrative market for their services in the country. Ukrainians see Americans as being really good at what in that part of the world is known as \u201cpolitical technology\u201d: using data, polling, consulting to win elections. One candidate in Ukraine\u2019s 2010 presidential election, for example, made the American political consultants working on his campaign a major selling point. It didn\u2019t work, but Ukrainians still pay top dollar for any associations with the American political elite. \u201cIt was a part of the world where there was a lot of money to be made,\u201d says Andrew Weiss, who oversees Russia and Eurasia research at the Carnegie Endowment. \u201cThese are people getting paid in a way that is totally out of proportion to how you would be paid elsewhere.\u201d Consider, for instance, the $12.7 million that Manafort made in just five years. Bernie Sanders\u2019s chief 2016 strategist, Tad Devine, was handsomely compensated for work he did for Yanukovych, too. When Devine was contemplating working on the 2014 Ukrainian election, he stipulated that his rate would be $10,000 per day\u2014not including travel.\n\nMuch of the money that works its way into politics in Ukraine comes from the energy sector\u2014perhaps the most lawless corner of the economy. \u201cUkraine is below Nigeria on the anti-corruption scale,\u201d says one former Obama administration official. \u201cIn part, it\u2019s because of natural resources. That\u2019s the most corrupt sector of the economy, and that is the one most closely tied to Russia.\u201d Burisma, the natural-gas giant that put Hunter Biden on its board\u2014and paid him as much as $50,000 a month\u2014is, in some ways, the perfect example. It was founded by Mykola Zlochevsky, who then went on to become Yanukovych\u2019s environment minister, the guy who handed out drilling licenses. Zlochevsky, who was alleged to have used his post to enrich himself and consolidate his holdings in the natural-gas sector, fled Ukraine when his patron, Yanukovych, was ousted from power. (He has since returned to the country.) Burisma is an extremely opaque company, but one with international ambitions. In that part of the world, the best way to launder one\u2019s shady reputation and shine for international investors is to hire big-name Western consultants\u2014as Burisma did. The Russians do this all the time, too, hiring big Western law firms and the Big Four auditing firms to provide window dressing to soothe Western investors. Would the American vice president\u2019s own son, the thinking goes, sit on the board of a bad company?
