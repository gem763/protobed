About 10 minutes after the lander began its descent, the commentary went quiet as officials talked among themselves with concern. K. Sivan, head of the space agency, announced that communication with the lander had been lost.\n\nAfter leaving the control center, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, \u201cThese are moments to be courageous, and courageous we will be!\u201d\n\n\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reacts to the news that contact was lost with the Vikram lander.

In April, Israel attempted to land a spacecraft on the lunar surface, only to fail in the final moments. India had hoped its Chandrayaan-2 mission would make it the fourth nation to land on the moon after the United States, Russia and China.\n\nPallava Bagla, science editor of news channel NDTV, said that the mission would not be considered a failure. Pointing to Chandrayaan-2\u2019s orbiter, which has a mission life of a year, he said, \u201cFifty percent of the mission is already successful and functional.\u201d\n\nThe orbiter carries eight scientific experiments for mapping the lunar surface and studying the outer atmosphere of the moon.\n\nExperts had warned that landing Vikram, named after the country\u2019s first space agency chief, would be challenging.\n\n\u201cProper soft landing is the most crucial part of the exercise,\u201d said Patrick Das Gupta , a professor in the physics and astrophysics department at Delhi University. \u201cFrom an altitude of 21 miles to zero height is the most scary time.\u201d\n\nSivan had called the landing maneuver \u201c15 minutes of terror\u201d in a television news interview.\n\nThe mission has been a source of immense national pride. Social media erupted in support of the space agency and its scientists.\n\n\u201cBe courageous,\u201d Modi told the scientists in the control room, in a moment that was broadcast across Indian public television and live-streamed online. \u201cThis is not a small achievement. The country is proud of you.\u201d\n\n\n\nA graph shows the Vikram lander diverging from its planned path (in red) Saturday.

The current mission would have looked for the presence of water.\n\nIndia\u2019s mission comes as other nations and companies are eyeing the lunar surface. This year, China landed a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, a first, and has plans to land another craft in the coming months.\n\nNASA is desperately trying to return to the moon \u2014 and had hoped to do so this year. Last year, the space agency chose nine companies to be eligible to bid on contracts to fly science experts to the lunar surface. At the time, NASA officials said they were pressing the companies to have a real sense of urgency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we get back to the moon as fast as possible,\u201d NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine told reporters this year. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take shots on goal.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump White House has directed the U.S. space agency to return astronauts to the moon by 2024, an aggressive timeline many think will be difficult to achieve.\n\nOne of the successes of India\u2019s space program has been its cost-effectiveness. Chandrayaan-2 cost $141 million, a fraction of what the United States spent on its historic Apollo moon mission.\n\nIndia also has begun preparations to send a manned mission to space by 2022.\n\n\n\nIndian Space Research Organization employees react as they wait for an announcement by the organization\u2019s chief, K. Sivan, at a facility in Bangalore on Saturday.
