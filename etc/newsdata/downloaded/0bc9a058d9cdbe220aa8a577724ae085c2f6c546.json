If the aim is not just to deny Boris Johnson a majority, but to get rid of the Conservatives as the party of government altogether, the best scenario would be Labour polling high, having created a solid anti-Brexit, anti-hard right, anti-austerity tripod.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened, but a progressive alliance is still more than capable of having a decisive impact. Nigel Farage says a pact between his Brexit party and the Tories would make them \u201cunstoppable\u201d. Yet the focus on Johnson\u2019s ability to ally with Farage is misplaced. The Conservatives and the Brexit party will certainly pull together; the only unknown is how many core Tory values the prime minister is prepared to traduce to get there, which is hardly unknown at all.\n\nA progressive alliance, on the other hand, would be much more fragile and its conclusions less foregone. The fundamental block is the Labour party \u2013 obsessed with vote share, it has always opposed alliances of any kind. In 2017, if it had stood aside in the Isle of Wight \u2013 bear in mind that this seat has never returned a Labour MP \u2013 the Greens would have repaid them in 12 other constituencies. But no dice, then, and advisers around Jeremy Corbyn were scornful about the successful alliances made between the Greens and the Liberal Democrats, on the basis that their main impact had been to reduce the Green vote share (cut by half on the 2015 election).\n\nYou expect a progressive alliance to look scrappy, patchworked, cobbled-together. But when it works, it often looks more like a landslide\n\nWhile Labour frontbenchers talk constantly to Liberal Democrats \u2013 indeed, last week\u2019s parliamentary victories couldn\u2019t have been won without a fair amount of talking to Tories \u2013 nobody at shadow cabinet level is talking about pacts. Emily Thornberry can just about hear the word \u201calliance\u201d without recoiling, but even she \u2013 pragmatic, in a 70% remain constituency \u2013 is not practically seeking one.\n\nThe Lib Dems have erected their own barriers, mainly in the form of their performative hostility towards Labour. Their full revoke stance, adopted this week, is not a meaningful contribution to the Brexit process, unless they believe they\u2019ll win an election outright \u2013 in which case they have taken leave of their senses. Rather, it\u2019s designed to underscore their superiority over the Labour party, in the eyes of hard remainers; entirely speciously, since they know they\u2019ll never be called out on it.\n\nTaken together with the much friendlier noises they make to Tory defectors than to anyone in the Labour hierarchy, it is hard to perceive much warmth between the two blocs. However, this is mostly strategic; it will help both the Lib Dems and Labour if remainer Tories \u2013 has any group ever been so politically homeless? \u2013 find somewhere to cast their votes, otherwise that\u2019s a 4 million-strong army of silence. It would be much harder for them to vote for Jo Swinson\u2019s party were it seen to be chummy with Corbyn\u2019s, and the smarter elements of Labour take their catcalls with a pinch of salt.\n\nA large, formal pact between the major remain forces \u2013 Labour, the Lib Dems, the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the SNP \u2013 is off the table. A month ago, people were talking about 1918, when the Liberals and Conservative coalition won a landslide victory by fielding a single candidate for both parties on a seat-by-seat basis. Never such innocence again.\n\nBut the jeopardy of a far-right Tory majority has introduced a trace of humility (\u201cWith the real prospect of an election, people begin to understand their real size,\u201d one pollster told me. \u201cSo Anna Soubry acts like she\u2019s Germany, but realises she\u2019s actually Luxembourg\u201d). According to Best for Britain data, around 457 seats are immune to alliances, leaving around 150 marginals. In 111 of these, the numbers strongly implore Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid to swing behind Labour (in 30 seats, even a 5% shift from Labour to the Lib Dems would deliver the seat to the Conservatives).\n\nThis is well understood by parliamentary candidates, who are in constant talks about non-aggression pacts. Seats such as Portsmouth South, Battersea, Bermondsey and Old Southwark, and Kensington and Chelsea are tantalising for the Lib Dems \u2013 either because they\u2019re the strongest second party and could leverage their bolder Brexit position, or because they\u2019ve had a recent surge \u2013 but the best bet for a progressive MP in those seats is for everyone to campaign for Labour. There are other seats where the Liberals have to run strong campaigns and be seen to do so. Hope Not Hate has data on Justine Greening\u2019s seat, Putney. The Labour candidate, Fleur Anderson, is strong and well liked, but the numbers \u2013 Tories 34%, Lab 22%, Lib Dems 30%, with a 7% Green showing \u2013 mean that anyone putting together tactical voting cribsheets would go Lib Dem.\n\nAfter the Brexit storm, a new political alliance could emerge | Rafael Behr Read more\n\nStraight tactical voting could work beautifully, or it could go very badly: if lots of different campaigns with different organisational interests make different recommendations, that will be wasted energy and, ultimately, wasted votes.\n\nNon-aggression pacts across clusters of seats are always under-reported, since they happen at grassroots level. But they\u2019re vital \u2013 the Greens in Norwich South would not have swung behind Labour\u2019s Clive Lewis in 2017 if the red-green candidates in neighbouring constituencies had been savaging each other. In the same year in East Sussex, there was an explicit trade in seats between the Lib Dems and the Greens, which nearly pulled off a progressive republic in a sea of blue.\n\nIn Cumbria, too, activists negotiated under the radar across five seats; and there was \u201cquite a lot of speed dating going on between the parties\u201d, as one Lib Dem activist put it, in Frome, Bristol West, Gloucester and Stroud. This is very similar to the informal alliances of 1997, which is the interesting bit; you expect a progressive alliance to look scrappy, patchworked, cobbled-together. But when it works, it often looks more like a landslide.\n\n\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Together, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, Plaid and the SNP could oust the Tories, says Guardian columnist Zoe Williams", "authors": ["Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd795902cb62265ab62150e0234d0b8a9dc3b5d8/0_384_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=11587fe40eedcf32e659eeb9119fb8a7", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
