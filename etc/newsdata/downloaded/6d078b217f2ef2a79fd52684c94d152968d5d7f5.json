There was no proactive notification,\" he explained, after discovering the bill by accident.\n\nHe claims he was sent a bill totalling \u00a39,300 - compared to his usual \u00a3120 usage.\n\n\"It was a panicked moment, given we'd been overseas a fair amount in the past couple of months.\"\n\n\"We suddenly had to question our roaming and contract set-ups to make sure we'd not inadvertently messed up.\"\n\n\"My wife's phone was subsequently blocked. I felt somewhat better when lots of other customers started tweeting their issues too.\"\n\nIt comes as Vodafone today admitted it suffered from a major technical glitch on Sunday, which resulted in more than 40,000 people losing data - and free roaming abroad.\n\nThousands of customers were also sent unusually high bills for data they never had access to.\n\n\"We had no direct contact from Vodafone despite several tweets, direct messages and being on the phone for 75 minutes last night. We gave up in the end,\" Mr Blevins said.\n\n\"I only received a generic tweet response at 11.42 this morning, explaining there had been a technical error.\"\n\n\"Don't worry - you can use your allowance roam-free\"\n\nKeith Holden, 44, was also left stunned after he claims he received an itemised bill with an additional charge of \u00a37,845.24 on Sunday evening.\n\n\"Both myself and my partner have been affected by Vodafone's glitch,\" he told Mirror Money.\n\n\"We've been in Brussels and Belgium - I received the standard text when we arrived in Brussels saying don't worry you can use your allowance roam free.\n\n\"Yesterday, I received a text saying I'd been capped for my data usage at \u00a339.01.\n\n(Image: MirrorPix)\n\n\"I couldn't access my account using my data at the time, so managed to get a WiFi connection when I was waiting for the train - and that's when my stomach dropped.\n\n\"My bill stated that I owed \u00a37,832 - my typical monthly bill for both my partner and I is \u00a367\".\n\nUnder Ofcom guidelines, when a network is down, it must make every effort to inform the customer and supply updates during the outage.\n\nHowever, Keith said he was faced with a blank after getting in touch with the network.\n\n\"I tried to contact Vodafone initially by twitter and was ignored, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger asking for details of my account - I responded but haven't had the courtesy of a response.\n\n\"Vodafone later started sending out the same standard response to all their customers. I am due to renew in November, I think it's likely I'll look elsewhere.\"\n\nCut off until I paid my bill\n\n(Image: Mirror Money)\n\nA third customer, Emma Jones, 25, from Stoke on Trent, says she was hit with a \u00a35,560.96 bill on Monday after being affected by the data outage while on holiday in New York.\n\nHer typical usage is around \u00a343 a month.\n\n\"They offered me 2GB extra of data which doesn't mean much to me as I already have 21GB that I rarely use up.\n\n\"They have now upgraded my plan to allow me to use my data and calls abroad but apparently I could have done this before - and I am paying extra for it.\n\n\"I tried to call my mum this morning as I am on holiday in New York and my phone told me I couldn't make any calls.\n\n\"I then went on my Vodafone app to find that bill, and was obviously left horrified.\n\n\"I contacted Vodafone on their chat straight away. I then received a text saying they had cut my phone off until I paid part of my bill.\"\n\n(Image: MirrorPix)\n\nAccountant, Emma, said the network has now reinstated her contract and she's since regained access to her phone - however she's still waiting for the \u00a35,560.96 bill to be wiped.\n\n\"They have assured me the charges will be waived but I am still seeing a \u00a35,560.96 bill on my app.\"\n\nWhat Vodafone says\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nMirror Money contacted Vodafone on the back of these charges with concerns that bills have not yet been amended.\n\n\"We\u2019re really sorry that yesterday, some customers could not use data or calling services when roaming,\" a statement said.\n\n\"The issue is now fixed and we\u2019re advising affected customers to restart their phones.\n\n\"Some people are also receiving billing messages in error; we are working through these as an urgent priority and are removing any errors from customer accounts.\n\n\"You will not be charged for these incorrect amounts and you don\u2019t need to worry about contacting us as we are proactively checking accounts and fixing any issues.\n\n\"This may take some time but we\u2019re working to fix it as quickly as we can.\n\n\"We will automatically compensate customers and will contact individuals with the details. We will proactively be in touch with any customer affected.\"\n\nIf you've been affected by the outage, see our guide to Vodafone refund and compensation rights, here .", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: A number of Vodafone customers claim they have today woken up to bills amounting to thousands of pounds - in some cases the same as a house deposit - after a data outage on Sunday", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty", "Mirrorpix", "Mirror Money"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9132383.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Vodafone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
