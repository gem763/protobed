REUTERS/Bobby Yip\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - A cyber attack on Asian ports could cost as much as $110 billion, or half the total global loss from natural catastrophes in 2018, a Lloyd\u2019s of London-backed report said on Wednesday.\n\nCyber insurance is seen as a growth market by insurance providers such as Lloyd\u2019s, which specializes in covering commercial risks, although take-up in Europe and Asia remains far behind levels in the United States.\n\nThe worst-case scenario in the report was based on a simulated cyber attack disrupting 15 ports in Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and China. Some 92% or $101 billion of the total estimated economic costs of such an attack are uninsured, Lloyd\u2019s said.\n\nThe figure was calculated by simulating the impact of a computer virus carried by ships and which scrambles cargo database records at the ports.\n\nThe report was produced by the University of Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies, on behalf of the Cyber Risk Management (CyRiM) project, in partnership with Lloyd\u2019s.\n\nAsia is home to nine of the world\u2019s 10 busiest ports and is a crucial part of the supply chains for the world\u2019s leading companies in sectors from autos to industrial goods, clothing and electronics.\n\nThe report estimated that the world\u2019s transport sector, including aerospace, would be hit the most, with economic losses totaling $28.2 billion. Manufacturing would take a $23.6 billion hit, while retail would face losses of $18.5 billion.\n\nCountries with links to each port would also be hit. As such, Asian countries would be hit the most, with $26 billion in indirect losses, followed by Europe with $623 million and North America with $266 million.\n\n\u201cWe know that the biggest assets for companies are not physical, they are intangible,\u201d said Lloyd\u2019s Chief Executive John Neal. \u201cWith the increasing application of technology and automation, these risks will become even more acute.\u201d", "description": "A cyber attack on Asian ports could cost as much as $110 billion, or half the total global loss from natural catastrophes in 2018, a Lloyd's of London-backed report said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Simon Jessop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446347229&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T00C", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
