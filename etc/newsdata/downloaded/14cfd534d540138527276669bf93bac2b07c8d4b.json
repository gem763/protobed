It\u2019s the industry\u2019s first ESG \u201cjunk bond\u201d exchange-traded fund, but the 10th product from Nuveen that incorporates ESG ideals.\n\nJordan Farris, the company\u2019s head of ETFs, says the idea came from a groundswell of demand for what Nuveen calls \u201cresponsible investing.\u201d Nuveen incorporates an additional component \u2014 low-carbon usage \u2014 to the E, S, and G principles most investors understand.\n\nBut there may be some good reasons why this kind of product hasn\u2019t yet been brought to market, said Ben Johnson, a research director at Morningstar. Among other things, it may be challenging to collect robust data sets on issuers of riskier debt, especially on securities that also fit the ESG category.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of moving parts and often what you\u2019re left with may deliver on the promise of screening out the bad actors, but the investment proposition might not be all that compelling,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSee: Welcome to the adult table, SEC says to ETFs\n\nWhile Nuveen says its approach to ESG includes an expectation that its returns will equal those of traditional investing strategies, Johnson points out that such a calculus can be complicated. There may now be more securities issued that fit both of the fund\u2019s criteria than in the past, but there are far fewer than in a more vanilla type of offering.\n\n\u201cMy concern is portfolio concentration,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to meet your values you may be increasing idiosyncratic risk\u201d by loading up on debt from just a few issuers, he said.\n\nRelated: Look at this ETF for a \u2018conscious capitalism\u2019 approach\n\nIt may also be a strange time to consider investing in high-yield debt.\n\nAs MarketWatch has reported, junk bonds are being issued with fewer and fewer protections for investors, making risky bets even riskier. Meanwhile, they\u2019re increasingly less attractive as the business cycle winds on. Traders are so skittish about being caught holding risky assets when economic conditions deteriorate that investor interest in junk bonds has long been considered an economic indicator of its own.\n\nFarris acknowledges such concerns but said Nuveen didn\u2019t want to try to time the market. The company wants to offer funds with an ESG approach for investors across all types of assets.", "description": "Did the investing world really need an exchange-traded fund that checks both these boxes?", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HK841_junk_c_ZG_20190605115030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
