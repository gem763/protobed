Liquidity was also lacking with Japan off and a partial\n\nmarket holiday in the United States for Columbus Day. MSCI's\n\nbroadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nrose 1.1% in light trade.\n\nAustralia's main index gained 0.7% and South Korea\n\n1.3%. Shanghai blue chips added 1.6%.\n\nWhile Tokyo was on holiday, Nikkei futures were trading at\n\n22,075 compared with a Friday close of 21,798 in the\n\nNikkei cash index. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 nudged\n\nup 0.2% after jumping on Friday.\n\nSentiment had been boosted when U.S. President Donald Trump\n\noutlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China\n\nand suspended a threatened tariff hike, though officials on both\n\nsides said much more work needed to be done. The emerging deal, covering agriculture, currency and some\n\naspects of intellectual property protections, would represent\n\nthe biggest step by the two countries in 15 months.\n\nAnalysts, however, advised caution.\n\n\"We have seen a truce established, and then broken, before,\"\n\nsaid Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia at JPMorgan Asset\n\nManagement.\n\n\"The threat to global growth is weak corporate capex, and\n\npotentially spilling over into the consumer sector,\" Hui added.\n\n\"CEOs are not going to restart investing again merely because of\n\nthe latest round of agreement between the two sides.\"\n\nThe drag from the trade war was a major reason Singapore's\n\ncentral bank eased monetary policy on Monday for the first time\n\nin three years as data showed the city-state's economy had only\n\nnarrowly dodged recession. WEEK FOR BREXIT\n\nThe progress on trade was still enough to slug safe-haven\n\nbonds with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes climbing 23\n\nbasis points last week to stand at 1.74% .\n\nThe yield curve also steepened as short-term rates were held\n\ndown by news the Fed would start buying about $60 billion per\n\nmonth in Treasury bills to ensure \"ample reserves\" in the\n\nbanking system. The rally in risk assets had seen the yen ease across the\n\nboard, leaving the dollar holding at 108.32 on Monday\n\nafter hitting a 10-week top around 108.61 on Friday.\n\nThe dollar fared less well elsewhere, partly due to a jump\n\nin sterling, and was last at 98.435 against a basket of\n\ncurrencies after losing 0.5% last week.\n\nThe dollar also slipped on the Chinese yuan to stand at\n\n7.0646 .\n\nThe pound was trading cautiously at $1.2598 having\n\nsurged to a 15-week high around $1.2705 on Friday on optimism\n\nBritain could reach a deal on Brexit with the European Union.\n\nHowever, officials from Downing Street and the EU said on\n\nSunday a lot more work would be needed to secure an agreement on\n\nBritain's departure from the bloc. The two sides will hold more talks on Monday ahead of a\n\nsummit of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe general improvement in risk sentiment saw spot gold ease\n\nanother 0.2% to $1,486.85 per ounce .\n\nOil prices pared gains made on Friday when reports surfaced\n\nthat an Iranian state-owned oil tanker had been attacked in the\n\nRed Sea. O/R\n\nInvestors were also anxiously watching Turkey's incursion\n\ninto Syria as the White House threatened to impose heavy\n\nsanctions on Ankara. Brent crude futures eased 31 cents at $60.20, while\n\nU.S. crude lost 30 cents to $54.40 a barrel.\n\n\n\nAsia stock markets https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nAsia-Pacific valuations https://tmsnrt.rs/2Dr2BQA\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Sam Holmes)\n\n", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia relieved at latest trade truce, China data disappoints", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
