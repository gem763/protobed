The interview with the radio host featured West pontificating on his image, his faith and his critics\u2014and the rapper still sits somewhere between arrogance and ignorance when it comes to sociopolitical issues. On the heels of his latest release, the Christian-themed Jesus Is King, West\u2019s take on race and culture has become even more steadfastly empty\u2014stifled by his belief in his own persecution and, most tellingly, by the resentment and stereotypical lens that he seems to have developed for his own people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only afraid of my daddy, God,\u201d West told Big Boy after he was asked whether or not he was afraid of losing his audience. \u201cI done been 15 years. I\u2019m telling you that God is showing you that you can have your own thoughts, bro. I been canceled before there was cancel culture.\u201d\n\nThat seems to be West\u2019s mantra these days: you\u2019re not the boss of me. It\u2019s his ultimate justification for Trump support; it\u2019s always been his most bitter barb at perceived gatekeepers that he\u2019s simultaneously fawned over. He may be talking more about God and Jesus these days, but Kanye West still mostly kneels at the altar of Kanye West. But its long past time for the public to depart from his church. West\u2019s persona has shifted from simply controversial to something more disturbing and damning. Under the shroud of religiosity and standard Ye hubris, he\u2019s become the Pied Piper of something more insidious: self-hatred.\n\nIn his recent spate of interviews, West has confirmed what many have suspected for years: he\u2019s wholly enamored and obsessed with white approval. And as he rails against liberals, it\u2019s obvious that what he despises about liberals is couched in what he believes about black people\u2014that we are led by the nose by the Democratic Party; that we are perpetrators of our own victimhood; that we are amoral and materialistic. He revealed as much during his sit-down with Big Boy, when he raved as he recounted an exchange with a white conservative who stopped him in traffic to praise him and equated Christianity with \u201cMiddle America.\u201d He repeatedly implied that that America\u2014the \u201cBible Belt,\u201d as he sees it\u2014is the \u201creal\u201d America, bemoaning everything from abortion to \u201ctaking God out of schools.\u201d After performing in black churches around the U.S., he\u2019s still using the MAGA tribe and its rhetoric as the example of faith in a country he sees as going off the rails. It says a lot about who he connects with, and who he aspires to be.\n\nAnd as the country continues to wrestle with race, West represents an anti-black mindset that galvanizes both politics and culture, as more young people parrot the president and his rhetoric and mouthpieces like Candace Owens continue to book high-profile engagements. Like Owens, West responds to questions about his Trump support with dismissals of the Democratic Party. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s so invested in separating himself from what he sees as \u201ctypical\u201d blackness that it doesn\u2019t matter who he aligns himself with\u2014so long as it separates him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not telling nobody to not vote Democrat, I love Obama, I love Lemonade, I love Wingstop, I love Polos, I love Jordans.\u201d\n\nThat West sees whiteness as Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, the \u201creal\u201d America and aspirational ingenuity, but sees blackness as Polos, songs about promiscuity and criminality, and voting for Hillary Clinton, is especially outrageous. While claiming that he\u2019s \u201cstill our voice\u201d (as Big Boy framed the question), West answered yes with the above Wingstop-referencing quote, as if that\u2019s what he thinks black people want from him. Earlier in the interview, West explained that he resented being viewed as a \u201ccoon\u201d because he didn\u2019t support Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential bid, as if there weren\u2019t legions of Black voters who were also not in support of Clinton. Not supporting Hillary Clinton does not automatically equate to fawning over Donald Trump, but for Kanye West, that seemed to be the logical conclusion. It\u2019s galling that he has become so disconnected from black viewpoints that he doesn\u2019t see how wide the chasm is between those two extremes; nor does he really grasp why so many have decided to walk away from him, and what he represents.\n\n\u201cLast year, y\u2019all tried to tell me who I\u2019m supposed to vote for because I\u2019m black. Now, this year, white liberals are trying to tell me who I\u2019m supposed to vote for because I\u2019m Christian.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me\u201d can breed idiocy if your viewpoint isn\u2019t led by anything other than a need to buck perceived criticism. But when your views are given platforms and when you have wide influence (Kanye claims that he\u2019s beloved by Gen Zers in high schools and colleges), it is irresponsible to proudly proclaim you aren\u2019t thinking that hard about what you say. When what you say carries so much contempt for your own; when what you say callously marginalizes non-Christians in your community, your audience and around the country; when you take an anti-abortion stance seemingly on a whim; and when you echo the ignorance of right-wing talking heads that condescend to black experiences and perspectives, your being \u201cfree\u201d to say what you want is secondary to the toxic ideas you endorse.\n\nWest is free to say and think however he wants\u2014and, given his immense popularity, he still has enough of a platform to espouse his ideas without much consequence. But at some point, we have to decide if he\u2019s worth listening to anymore. He can say these things because he knows that he doesn\u2019t need the community that made him anymore. He knows that there is an audience\u2014and a president\u2014that loves having him on their side. That most of them don\u2019t look like him is actually a boon to him. He knows where his bread is now being buttered.\n\nHe knows who his bosses are.", "description": "The \u201cJesus Is King\u201d gospel-rapper is possessed of retrograde beliefs about what it means to be black in America, writes Stereo Williams.", "authors": ["Stereo Williams"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572415501/191029-stereo-kanye-west-tease_gclnti", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
