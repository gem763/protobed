This year's holiday shopping season is six days shorter than in 2018 because of a shorter stretch between Thanksgiving and Christmas, an incentive for Walmart and other retailers to start sales early.\n\nIts \"Early Deals Drop\" on Walmart.com on Friday will include discounts on electronics, toys, sporting goods and more.\n\n\"Saving our customers time is also paramount at this time of year, especially with fewer days to get ready for big family meals, parties and gift giving,\" said Steve Bratspies, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer for Walmart U.S.\n\nDeals include a $99 trampoline and a smart TV for $398. The retailer will also offer free next-day delivery on select items, without a membership fee.\n\nOther big retailers are making similar offers to compete for customers over the holidays. Best Buy has said it will offer free next-day delivery on orders over $35 as well as free standard shipping over the holidays. This marks the first time the electronic goods chain has offered free next-day delivery in a bid to win over shoppers.\n\nBut customers don't always bite at these kinds of offers, research shows. Just 15% of shoppers said fast shipping is more important than free shipping, according to a holiday survey this week from consultancy Deloitte.\n\nThe study shows that Americans are expected to spend an average of nearly $1,500 per household for the holidays this year, up almost 5% from 2018. Total e-commerce sales in the U.S. are expected to grow by up to 18% this year.\n\nRetailers expected to shutter 12,000 stores this year\n\nAs more Americans shop online, many retailers have ramped up efforts to draw shoppers to physical stores by offering better in-store experiences, dubbed by some as \"retailtainment.\"\n\nWalmart says it will host Pok\u00e9mon and Star Wars-themed events in-store around the holidays in addition to the requisite visits from Santa.\n\nDespite Walmart's head start, holiday spending won't peak until early December, versus its usual crest around Thanksgiving, Deloitte predicts. Thanksgiving is unusually late, with Black Friday falling on November 29 and Cyber Monday on December 2. Nearly 70% of consumers say they'll start shopping in early December.\n\nStill those shoppers who start early tend to spend more \u2014 $1,6660 versus $1,239 \u2014 according to Deloitte, and Walmart hopes to claim some of that spend.", "description": "Walmart is starting its holiday sales early this year -- October 25 -- to draw out a shorter holiday shopping season", "authors": ["Megan Cerullo"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/24/9ae191bb-429c-49a6-a905-503550f83685/thumbnail/1200x630/a85208498b8ea987e32fec375e289eae/gr1-7537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
