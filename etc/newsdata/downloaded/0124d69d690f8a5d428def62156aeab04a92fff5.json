The conditions include that a patient is experiencing unbearable suffering with no hope of recovery, and wishes to die.\n\nThe trial centered around a 74-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease four years before her death.\n\nThe patient had a certified living will stating her wish for euthanasia if her condition were to worsen significantly. The doctor carried out the mercy killing with the consent and support of the woman\u2019s family.\n\nProsecutors brought the criminal case, arguing that the doctor should also have checked with the patient herself, even though she was no longer mentally competent, saying the law was unclear on that point.\n\nBut judges ruled the doctor was right to rely solely on the living will to carry out the mercy killing.\n\n\u201cThe court concludes that the doctor did not need to verify the current desire for euthanasia (of the patient),\u201d presiding judge Mariette Renckens said.\n\nThe judge said the patient was too affected by dementia to make a \u201ccoherent\u201d request to die, but that her request was clear in her living will and from numerous prior conversations with her family and medical professionals.\n\n\u201cThis is a clear advice of the judges that it is possible to give euthanasia to a person who is no longer mentally competent but does want euthanasia,\u201d Steven Pleiter of the Dutch Centre of Expertise for Euthanasia told journalists.\n\nHe said the mercy killing of people in such an advanced stage of dementia is rare and makes up just two or three cases out of over 6,000 cases of euthanasia reported in the Netherlands each year.", "description": "A Dutch doctor was acquitted on Wednesday of all charges for the euthanasia of an elderly patient who suffered from dementia.", "authors": ["Stephanie Van Den Berg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
