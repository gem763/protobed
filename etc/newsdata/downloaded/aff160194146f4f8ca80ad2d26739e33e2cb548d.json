Photo: Getty Images\n\nWhat is passion if not the precariously thin line between adoration and agony? A fixation so consuming that it frees and traps you at the same time. A hot sauce that burns your tongue, but also loosens it, so that you, Shia LaBeouf, can inform all of your fellow diners how good it is.\n\nYes, according to \u201cPage Six,\u201d the actor, performance artist, and dirtbag street-style icon has a new passion, and it is the house-made \u201clacto-fermented\u201d hot sauce at Honey Hi on Sunset Boulevard. Per \u201cPage Six\u201d:\n\nAs the \u201cTransformers\u201d star bussed his own plates after enjoying his meal outdoors, he kept repeating his love for their hot sauce saying, \u201cWow! This hot sauce is amazing! Has everyone tried it?\u201d loudly enough for the entire restaurant to hear.\n\nThe source added, \u201cIt was absolutely a bit manic, but it was also very sweet.\u201d They did not say whether they had tried the hot sauce, and whether it was indeed worthy of LaBeouf\u2019s hype.\n\nPerhaps the lacto-fermented hot sauce will take over the emotional real estate once occupied by LaBoeuf\u2019s previous passions, like his anti-Trump livestream\u2013slash\u2013performance art piece called HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US that he installed at the Museum of the Moving Image on the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration, which was shut down a month later after it attracted neo-Nazi trolls, and LaBoeuf was arrested for getting into an altercation with one of them. So far, no sauce-related altercations have been reported.\n\nOnly time will tell if Kanye West will take this hot sauce from LaBeouf as well as his clothes.\n\nStay in touch.
