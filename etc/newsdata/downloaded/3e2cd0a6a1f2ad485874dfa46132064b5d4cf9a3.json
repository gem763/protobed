You can reduce the number of flights, ferries or train journeys to get from one place to the other, and you can do that while you\u2019re sleeping. As someone who loves to explore different places, the idea of waking up in a different destination each day is very attractive. A cruise allows people to get the maximum out of their precious holiday time.\n\nYou took your family to the Gal\u00e1pagos on Celebrity Flora. What makes the ship so special?\n\nThere are many things Celebrity Cruises has installed into Flora that will become the norm for ships. She has solar panels to supplement electricity. There\u2019s no plastic on board, which is a big passion of mine, and they\u2019ve done it well. It\u2019s never a hassle to get water: each room has a fresh-water drinking tap chilled by osmosis, so you\u2019re drinking sea water. It\u2019s brilliant \u2013 you can\u2019t taste the difference. My kids loved that Flora has an onboard laboratory and scientific equipment that tracks sea temperatures: all sorts of data is harnessed while you travel, and contributing to our understanding of this very fragile ecosystem. Each day my children spent an hour on-board with a naturalist, looking down microscopes, examining the volcanic rock that they\u2019d collected from the beach.", "description": "TV adventurer Ben Fogle shares his love of the Gal\u00e1pagos and why he feels passionate about helping his children become responsible travellers", "authors": ["Kaye Holland"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Cruise/RESTRICTED-Ben-Fogle-family-in-the-Galapagos-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
