The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.09% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.26% were both up by at least 0.2%.\n\n\u2018We serve all Americans, regardless of their political party.\u2019 Jerome Powell\n\nPowell said he hasn\u2019t regretted becoming the leader of U.S. central bank, responding to a question that appeared to be a loosely veiled reference to constant attacks the Fed chairman has endured from President Donald Trump who nominated him.\n\nTrump has persistently criticized Powell, saying, as recently as Friday morning that he questioned his decision to pick the 66-year-old former lawyer and private-equity investor. Unlike most Fed chiefs, Powell is not a trained economist. \u201cWhere did I find this guy Jerome,\u201d the president said via Twitter.\n\nI agree with @jimcramer, the Fed should lower rates. They were WAY too early to raise, and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didn\u2019t exactly help either. Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well, you can\u2019t win them all! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\nPowell repeated that the Fed makes its decisions in a nonpolitical manner.\n\nWhen asked specifically about a controversial essay by former top Fed official William Dudley, who postulated that the Fed might consider Trump\u2019s reelection prospects when making policy, Powell said Dudley\u2019s idea was \u201csimply wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe serve all Americans, regardless of their political party,\u201d he said.", "description": "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the August job report was a sign of continued strength in the U.S. labor market", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO462_powell_ZG_20190731080600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
