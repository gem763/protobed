In the phone call, Trump asked Zelensky to look into Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter's, swampy behavior. Hunter sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company and was being paid $50,000 a month despite having zero experience in natural energy. At the time, Joe Biden was handling affairs with the Ukrainian government. Democrats were quick to say Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky investigated. That was proven to be false.\n\nAccording to the president, the impeachment inquiry is nothing more than another witch hunt, a clear reference to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller ultimately said no collusion took place and failed to make a determination that collusion took place.\n\n\u201cWe have a great relationship in the Senate. I have a 95 percent approval rating in the Republican Party. I believe the Senate \u2013 and I haven\u2019t spoken to that many senators \u2013 but I believe the senators look at this as a hoax, it\u2019s a witch hunt, it\u2019s a disgrace. Should have never happened. Just like Russian collusion delusion should have never happened. That was a witch hunt,\" Trump said. And just like that, should have never happened. So I think in the Senate, I think they feel the Republican Party has been treated very very badly.\"\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to unload on Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) over allowing freshman Democrats to have control over the party.\n\n\"Now, in the House, they have the majority. They all vote with AOC and plus three. Nancy Pelosi is petrified of them,\" he explained. \"I mean she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s going to lose her position. Nancy Pelosi will lose her speakership right after the election when the Republicans take over the House.\u201d\n\nTrump is right. Pelosi has lost all control of her caucus. Ever since this new Congress began, she has repeatedly said Democrats would not pursue impeachment. She knew it would hurt Democrats in the long run. But the progressive freshmen, known as \"The Squad,\" have been outspoken about their opposition to Nancy and her plans. They've made it very clear they campaigned on impeaching Trump and they need to do that to keep their seats.\n\nPelosi has at least made peace with the fact that the Democrats will lose the House next year. That's why she made the point that it's more important to \"protect and defend the Constitution\" than it is to keep control of the House.", "description": "Boom..10/04/2019 19:50:42PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/5362b7ab-ef7e-449c-8704-0e51a8cf9d45.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
