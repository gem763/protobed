Mitt Romney (R-UT) suggested Friday that he is not leading a Never Trump Republican coup against President Donald Trump.\n\nSen. Romney, who has served as a frequent critic of President Trump, denied that he is leading a Never Trump GOP coup against the president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m leading a wing of the party. Because there\u2019s no wing that\u2019s very large that is aligned with me,\u201d Romney said this week in an interview with Politico.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been back, I have not spoken with a single senator about the impeachment process or about the implications of the process that\u2019s going on or how I would vote,\u201d the failed 2012 Republican presidential candidate said.\n\nRomney\u2019s interview follows as President Trump called the freshman Utah senator a \u201cpompous ass\u201d and Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, asked if Romney is \u201ccolluding to bring down our president.\u201d The president\u2019s son shared a video from the conservative Club for Growth group, criticizing Romney\u2019s anti-Trump tactics:\n\nIs Mitt Romney colluding to bring down our president? He begged to be in the administration and now he\u2019s bitter and angry! https://t.co/4suNgAavR1 \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 16, 2019\n\nSen. Romney has frequently criticized and opposed Trump\u2019s legislative agenda since before he took office. Before Vice President Mike Pence swore-in Romney to become the junior senator from Utah, Romney took to the leftist Washington Post to slam President Trump.\n\nSen. Romney has on multiple occasions voted against Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration, which allows him to secure the southern border by reappropriating defense funds.\n\nThe Utah senator delivered a speech on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon, issuing a sharp rebuke of the president\u2019s move to withdraw troops from northern Syria.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria and allegedly \u201cabandon the Kurds,\u201d Romney said, \u201cwill stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nFurther, Romney attacked the \u201cadministration,\u201d or President Trump, for speaking \u201ccavalierly, even flippantly, even as our ally has suffered death and casualty.\u201d\n\nSen. Romney even discounted President Trump\u2019s efforts to cease America\u2019s \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\nDespite his opposition to Trump\u2019s policies on immigration and foreign policy, the Utah senator said he and Trump see \u201ceye-to-eye\u201d on most issues.\n\nRomney\u2019s opposition to Trump\u2019s America First policies has incensed Trump-supporting Republicans in Utah. One even suggested he might primary Romney should he run for reelection in 2024.\n\nLeland Pollock, a Garfield County commissioner said, \u201cHe\u2019s made some bad comments about Donald Trump, and Donald Trump has done everything we\u2019ve asked him to do. If [Romney] decides to run in 2024, I\u2019ll even put my black hat in the ring. I would run myself.\u201d\n\nDarin Bushman, a Piute County commissioner, said, \u201cThe people who are in love with Mitt Romney right now are the Democrats. And there aren\u2019t a lot of them in Utah. I actually did vote for him. And I regret that to this day. If I had to do it over tomorrow, I would vote for the Democrat.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
