(Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cHe's been the ultimate teammate, competitor, gamer,\u2019\u2019 Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, \u201che left everything on the field. Left everything he had on the mound.\n\n\u201cI talk about it to our guys every now and then about, 'Give us everything you've got.' And CC embodied that, and he left it all out there last night. \u2026\n\n\u201cIn a weird way, it was kind of a perfect way to go out.\u2019\u2019\n\nThis is one of baseball\u2019s greatest warriors. He pitched at least 190 innings in 11 seasons during his career, won a Cy Young award with the Cleveland Indians in 2007, pitched on short rest down the stretch to lead the Milwaukee Brewers to the postseason in 2008, won a World Series title with the Yankees in 2009, and became only the 25th pitcher to win at least 250 games with 300 strikeouts.\n\nHe loved the game of baseball, and baseball loved him back.\n\nIn Sabathia\u2019s dreams, he would have been standing on the mound one last time in the World Series, with the Yankees capturing their second title since his arrival in 2009, but this is real life, not Hollywood.\n\nIt\u2019s over with the Yankees making it official by replacing him on the postseason roster with reliever Ben Heller. Even if the Yankees miraculously recovered from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Houston Astros in the ALCS, he\u2019d be ineligible for the World Series.\n\nSo this is where it ends, at Yankee Stadium, in front of a sellout crowd, and an emotional clubhouse who weren\u2019t quite ready to stay good-bye.\n\n\u201cYou can never say that man didn\u2019t give his all,\u201d Yankees slugger Aaron Judge said. \u201cYou had to rip the jersey off to get him off that mound. He got everything out of that arm. That\u2019s a warrior right there.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he has so much respect around the game. He left it all out there.\u201d\n\nGAME 4: Astros silence Yankee fans with win\n\nTHE CHOSEN ONE:Harper opens up about Nationals' World Series run\n\nWhat other pitcher would blow out his shoulder on a pitch, stay on the mound facing George Springer, and throwing three more pitches before he simply couldn\u2019t tolerate the pain.\n\n\u201cWhen I was throwing those pitches to Springer,\u2019\u2019 Sabathia said, \u201c I couldn't even look up to see where I was throwing the ball. I was just letting it go and whatever happened, happened. \u2026\n\n\u201cI threw until I couldn\u2019t anymore.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s Sabathia.\n\nThis is his legacy.\n\n\u201cI think everyone understands how authentic it is and genuine,\u2019\u2019 Boone said. \u201cHe's the best. I mean, he's how you would draw it up from a teammate standpoint, from a competitor standpoint.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest things CC has -- and I think is one of the greatest things on a human being -- is he's kind of dripping with humility. That's real. That's who he is.\n\n\u201cA lot of people can come across that way. CC is that. And it's why I think he's beloved in there but across the sport and really with anyone he comes in contact with.\n\n\u201cBut as far as a ballplayer, a competitor, and a teammate, it's hard to draw it up any better than CC Sabathia.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe crowd at Yankee Stadium, who had been booing their team all night, stopped and gave Sabathia a standing ovation when he clutched his shoulder, walked off the field Thursday, through the dugout, and crumbled walking down the steps.\n\nJoe Girardi, Sabathia\u2019s former manager, choked back tears talking about Sabathia on the MLB Network postgame show. Even the Astros clapped their hands out of respect watching him leave the field.\n\n\u201cI think that's what got me more emotional than the actual injury,\u2019\u2019 Sabathia said. \u201cJust hearing the fans and the way that they were cheering me. It just makes me feel good. \u2026It was just awesome to hear that and get that on the way out. \u2026\n\n\u201cMakes you super emotional. So many texts, tweets, so many things. It\u2019s been awesome.\u2019\u2019\n\nSabathia, 39, hopes to stay in the Yankee organization. He\u2019ll work as a special assistant, an advisor, an instructor, whatever they desire.\n\nThe only thing he knows for sure is that he has thrown his final pitch.\n\n\u201cI told Amber (his wife) last night that this was the best way for it to end for me,\u2019\u2019 Sabathia said, \u201cbecause of the way I\u2019ve been feeling, loving the bullpen, jogging out, feeling pretty good. I feel like about July of next year, I\u2019ll be like, I think I can pitch.\n\n\u201cSo, knowing that obviously the way I feel now, I can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fitting.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not sappy enough for a movie script, but for this man, it truly is perfect ending.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "CC Sabathia, still in severe pain a day later, his left arm in a sling, the Yankees acknowledged that his 19-year career is over.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
