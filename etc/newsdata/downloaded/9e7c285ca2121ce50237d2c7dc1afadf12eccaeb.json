The elders in her family, Flores said, spoke in a hidden language to conceal the contents of their conversations\u2014maybe gossip, risque jokes, or private discussions.\n\n\n\nBut there was something more, something subtle and revelatory: when they spoke in that language, everyone seemed more at ease, more confident and trusted. Flores would wish to be part of that circle of trust, that exclusive conversation. This way, she'd be able to understand the topics that were exclusive to adults.\n\nWhat Flores grew up with was Quechua, a native Andean language of the Quechua indigenous people. Quechua is the second-most spoken language in Peru, and also used in Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina.\n\n\u201cMaybe my curiosity to figure out what they were saying was the catalyst for all this,\u201d said Flores, who's from Huamanga, a small province of Ayacucho, an Peruvian Andes region south of Lima.\n\n\u201cAll of this\u201d is her actual career as a pop singer in Quechua, a career that took off in 2015 from her cover of Michael Jackson\u2019s famous hit \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel.\u201d Flores has dedicated nearly the last five years to performing songs in her family and ancestors' native tongue, and combines trap, hip-hop, and electronic influences with Andean instruments. In a country like Peru, where many feel pressure to hide their indigenous roots, Flores\u2019s singing is surprising and provocative.\n\nHer unconventional musical choices have brought huge success: millions of views on YouTube; features and interviews in Peruvian media and foreign press like The Clinic, Telemundo, El Pa\u00eds, AJ+ Espa\u00f1ol, CNN, and BBC; fans in Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Mexico, the United States, Spain, Italy, China, Algeria, and counting. And with it, Flores is challenging the very way people value languages, especially indigenous ones.\n\nWhen she first began to sing, around five or six years old, Flores didn\u2019t know Quechua. Her maternal and paternal grandparents, the most gifted Quechua speakers of the family, didn\u2019t really instill it in their children. Flores's parents became attentive listeners but rarely spoke it. Over time, neither grandparents, parents, or any other family members found it necessary, much less useful, to teach Quechua to Flores. The singing granddaughter began to train her voice in English.\n\nPatricia Rivera, Flores's mother and manager, remembers the first time she heard Renata sing: she sang a Green Day song to herself in her bedroom.\n\n\u201cIt was a strong and serious voice,\u201d Rivera told VICE. \"When I heard her, I was impressed.\u201d\n\nRivera and Flores's father, Milder Flores, were both musicians who owned an academy called Shapes and Sounds. Renata started attending the academy at an early age, where she learned the violin and continued her studies with piano, and eventually focused on singing.\n\nFlores rehearsed with songs by Adele, The Animals, Alicia Keys, and Michael Jackson, putting more and more emphasis on her vocal training. Since she wasn\u2019t fluent in English, she would sing the covers phonetically. Instead of picking up Quechua, Flores was doing what many Peruvians and Latin Americans do because they consider it necessary to survive: learning English.\n\nIt\u2019s very common for many Quechua speakers to not teach their children or grandchildren the language because they consider this knowledge as a burden. To explain the shortage of active bilingualism in Peru, the linguist Virginia Zavala uses the concept of \"linguistic ideologies,\" which are the ideas that people have about languages. For example: French is the language of love; German sounds rough; Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish are similar.\n\nQuechua, similarly to other indigenous languages, is associated with poverty, rural life, and illiteracy. These ideas have been shaped by history and society to the point that people hold on to these beliefs as if they were universal truths. And these \u201ctruths\u201d are deeply embedded in their conscious thought process. Value hierarchies also exist with languages. Some are \u201cworth\u201d more than others.\n\nThe end result is that many native Quechua speakers believe that using Quechua in public is unnecessary after learning Spanish. Either by shyness or shame, they reserve their maternal tongue for private spaces and intimate conversations.\n\n\u201cQuechua is a mark of vulnerability,\u201d Zavala says in one of her YouTube classes\u2014or worse, a sign of inferiority that isolates and condemns its speakers. That\u2019s why some Quechua speakers are reticent to use the language more widely.\n\nIn 2014, Flores's life took what one might call a linguistic turn. After participating in a singing TV show titled \"The Voice Kids,\" she and her mom decided to do a cover and shoot a music video. She was determined to stand out from the competition. The idea was to combine Andean instruments, like the quena and the charango, with the piano, which Flores knew how to play very well. But both mother and daughter agreed that there should be something more, something new.\n\n\n\n\u201cImmediately the idea of language dawned on us,\u201d said Rivera.\n\nIn the video clip of \u201cIntipa lluksina wasi,\u201d Flores appears to be playing the piano in the middle of La Pampa de la Quinua grasslands, a perfect representation of her home region of Ayacucho. On YouTube and Facebook, the video received hundreds of likes and comments. But that was nothing, or very little, compared to what happened a month later.\n\nEncouraged by the positive reception of her song, Flores and Rivera wanted to try it again but this time with a Quechua cover of \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel\u201d by Michael Jackson titled \u201cChaynatam ruwanki cuyanaita.\u201d From that song, a fusion of blues, jazz and Peruvian music, everything escalated in a way that neither Flores nor her family could have imagined.\n\nIn less than two weeks from the release of the video\u2014which naturally was recorded in Vilcashuam\u00e1n, an Incan fortress\u2014it received more than a million views. The calls and interview requests poured in. TV programs and radio shows, newspapers, magazines, blogs, Peruvian and foreign, were talking about this blue chullo-wearing girl who, against the serene mountainous backdrop, sang modern songs in the Incan tongue.\n\nJust like she did as a young girl in English, Flores memorized Quechua lyrics phonetically. Since no one taught her, she only know how to say \u201ca\u00f1a\u00f1au\u201d after eating something tasty, or \u201cacacau\u201d when something was hurting, or \u201calalau\u201d when she felt cold. For tips pronunciation and linguistic nuance, Renata asked her paternal grandmother Adalberta, a family relative who until then had spoken the Andean language in private. Her grandmother, although surprised by the request, accepted.\n\nFlores knows that many of her fans and followers are not fluent in Quechua, so she makes her songs easy to pronounce and understand. Sometimes, she has captioned videos at her concerts so the audience can read and sing along. \u201cI believe they do understand and learn the lyrics that way,\u201d she said. \u201cMusic is the true universal language.\"\n\n\u201cI like Quechua because it\u2019s a language that is considerate of others,\u201d said Flores. In Quechua, for example, there are two pronouns for \u201cus\u201d: \u201c\u00f1uqanchik\u201d and \u201c\u00f1uqaiku\u201d. The first translates to \u201cyou and I, or you and us,\u201d and the second translates to \u201cus, but not them.\u201d (It's referred to as \u201cus inclusive\u201d and \u201cus exclusive.\")\n\nHer lyrics, which are composed in Spanish and later translated to Quechua with the assistance of a professor in Huamanga, use pop, trap, hip hop, electronica fused with Andean music and instruments, such as quena, zampo\u00f1a or violins, such as in the song \"Tijeras\":\n\nManan pipas qawanchu manan imatapas\n\nAtinichu ruwayta, rimayta munani\n\nQaparispanmi, tukuy runamanan uyarikunchu\n\nRimasqayta Qinaspa nini Qaparisaqmi\n\n\u201cNo one sees anything, I can\u2019t do anything, I want to speak with loudness, people don\u2019t hear what I say, so I\u2019ll shout,\u201d Flores sings.\n\nQuechua is an official language of Peru, and it is also the second most widely spoken language after Spanish. According to statistics from the Ministry of Culture, 3,805,531 Peruvians speak Quechua, representing a little over 13% of the population. That\u2019s more than the population of Uruguay, and comparable to the population of Panama. Peruvian Quechua speakers represent a little over 13% of Peru\u2019s population, and in the last 10 years, have grown by almost half a million.\n\nWhile these are positive numbers for Quechua, the statistics are not favorable for other native languages. Of the 6,700 worldwide, approximately 40% are in danger of disappearing. Peru has the third-most language diversity in Latin America, behind Mexico and Brazil. The country is host to 48 native languages, but 21 are in danger of disappearing. According to information from the Ministry of Culture, there are a number of Amazonian languages under real threat, with very few speakers. For example, the Muniche only has eight remaining speakers; the I\u00f1apari has only five; and the Omagua and Res\u00edgaro have just three each. The Taushiro language has only one speaker left.\n\n\u201cThe key to encouraging bilingualism,\u201d Virgina Zavala says in a YouTube video, \u201cis to fundamentally change the [social] environment,\u201d which is currently not supportive of native languages. It is crucial to change the social thought process that sees \"Quechua is a problem\" to \"Quechua is a resource.\"\n\nThis change must be implemented by both public institutions and the speakers themselves. The institutions can do this by passing new legislature, through public policy, scholarships, and workshops which promote Quechua speech. The speakers can implicitly agree with one another to use the language in spaces where it was not done before\u2014just like Flores, who is bringing Quechua to the world of pop.\n\n\u201cI used to see the discrimination that my grandmother would face for knowing Quechua. There was one time I felt ashamed of being with her, and now I regret that,\u201d Renata says in \u201cWho I Am,\u201d a short documentary about her life.\n\nFlores said she was a bit freaked out by her sudden rise to fame. Why all this attention? Why did other people care so much about this musical experiment she created with her mother? The media spoke about reclaiming Quechua, and how Flores was helping the language gain new value. Those are big words, ones that suggest a commitment that Flores wasn't sure she was ready for. One day, Flores asked, \u201cMom, what did we get ourselves into?\u201d\n\nIn \"Who I Am\", Rivera tells a story of a random man on the street who lashed out to Renata: \"Who are you to represent the Quechua people?\" Despite her popularity, Flores has received criticism from those who still do not accept Quechua in new spaces, as if those spaces degrade or distort the \"essence\" of the language.\n\nRenata, however, is not the only transgressor of the supposed status quo in the Andean language. There are plenty of other Peruvian singers who are taking the language to various musical genres which are not traditional: Liberato Kani with hip hop, soprano Sylvia Falc\u00f3n sings in Andean lyrics, Damaris fuses it with pop, Uchpa with rock. Other Latin American countries also have singers in this similar vein; Mexico is one of the most prolific with the Mixe soprano Mar\u00eda Reyna, Mayan rapper Pat Boy, and the Tsotsil band Lumatok's psychedelic rock.\n\n\u201cThe stereotype where indigenous people are seen as timeless or pure must be challenged. When native people are put in that box, we are fossilizing them,\u201d said Am\u00e9rico Mendoza Mori, coordinator of the Quechua Program at the University of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania. Mori, who was also an advisor on the Quechua dialogue in the \u201cDora the Explorer\" movie, strongly believes in Quechua reaching the rest of the world in different media, from movies to pop songs. He also also encourages speakers of indigenous languages to use present-day social media platforms to communicate with one another, something Flores has found great success with.\n\n\u201cSunqullay\u201d and \u201cpitaq kani\u201d are Flores\u2019s favorite words in Quechua. She uses sunqullay\u2014\u201cmy little sweetheart\u201d or \u201cwith heart\u201d\u2014constantly in her social media posts to express gratitude to her fans and followers for their support. \u201cPitaq kani\u201d is a question the young singer frequently asks herself: \u201cWho am I?\"\n\nEven before she blew up, Flores hadn\u2019t really thought about who she was, which is another way of asking where do I come from? When she finally did ask, she started taking Quechua classes (she\u2019s improving, but still has a long road ahead) and studying the Andean worldview. The project \u201cYoung people also speak Quechua,\u201d which she established with her mother to spread Quechua, became \u201cPitaq kani\u201d, and this year they received governmental funding to continue growing. She also began to create original compositions: \u201cMirando a la misma luna\u201d / \u201dLooking at the same moon\u201d, \u201cTijeras\u201d / \u201cScissors\u201d, \u201cMiradas\u201d / \u201cLooks\u201d, songs that deal with identity, discrimination, and violence against women. Her latest release, \u201cQam hina,\u201d which Flores composed and produced, is about the hard life for girls in rural areas.\n\n\u201cMy mother and I always talk about issues that are happening, what could be the theme for the next song, what it can teach. I don\u2019t want to make songs about nothing, I want them to reach people,\u201d said Flores.", "description": "When she was 14, Flores rose to fame with her Quechua cover of Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel\u201d, which has over 2 million views. Now 18, she is a spokesperson for one of the most widely spoken indigenous languages in Latin America.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9283f81b54520008099e96/lede/1569941661643-169_RenataFlores_V1.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
