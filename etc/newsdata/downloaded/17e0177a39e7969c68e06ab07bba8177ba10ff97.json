Love it.\"\n\nKeegan had completely lost his cool and inevitably, Ferguson's United went on to win the league.\n\n'Wee club in the North East'\n\nTimes may have shifted since Newcastle were a genuine threat at the top of the table, but that didn't stop Fergie poking fun at his former rivals in 2012.\n\nDuring a disagreement aired via the press with then-Newcastle manager Alan Pardew, Fergie delivered a thinly-veiled dig at the size of Newcastle.\n\n(Image: Stu Forster)\n\n\"Alan Pardew's come out and criticised me,\" said Ferguson.\n\n\"Alan Pardew's the worst, his whole staff for criticising and haranguing the referee. He was at it the whole game on Wednesday.\n\n\"He shoves the referee and makes a joke of it and he's got the cheek to criticise me - it's unbelievable.\n\n\"It's unfortunate - I carry that because I'm the manager of the most famous club in the world. I'm not at Newcastle, a wee club in the North East.\"\n\nAlan Shearer and the Man Utd transfer that never happened\n\nDuring the glory days under Ferguson Man Utd could seemingly sign whoever they liked - but they never managed to get Alan Shearer.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe former Newcastle and England captain has confirmed that the Red Devils made an approach for him, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"I had a call from someone at Manchester United, said Shearer. \"They said they'd heard about the talks and they were interested.\"\n\nBut Shearer had already made a promise to Newcastle, and upon telling Man Utd that he needed an answer within three days, they never returned. Newcastle fans still sing about it to this day.", "description": "Though neither side are challenging at the top of the table this season, there's plenty of history behind the clash between Newcastle and Man Utd", "authors": ["Joe Cooper", "Image", "Skysports", "Stu Forster", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20387586.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_KEVIN-KEEGAN-AND-ALEX-FERGUSON.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
