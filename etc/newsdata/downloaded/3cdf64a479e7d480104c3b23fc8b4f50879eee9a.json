That translates to nearly 2.6 million elderly folks who don\u2019t enjoy regular human contact on a daily basis. Perhaps most alarming though is researchers say an alarming 225,000 individuals will go a week without talking to anyone face-to-face.\n\n\u201cA friendly \u2018hello\u2019 or \u2018how are you?\u2019 is something most of us take for granted \u2013 it\u2019s just part of every day life, but these latest figures show that hundreds of thousands of older people in the UK will spend today and the rest of this week alone, with no one to share even a few simple words with,\u201d says Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, which partnered with Cadbury Dairy Milk to commission the research, in a statement.\n\nThe survey also revealed that 38% of seniors admit to feeling lonely at times as they\u2019ve aged, with 12%, or about one in eight, agreeing that loneliness has kept them from leaving their home.", "description": "", "authors": ["Study Finds", "Studyfinds.Org Lonely-Lives-Alarming-Number-Of-Seniors-Go-Entire-Week-Without-Talking-To-Anyone"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
