Ilhan Omar (D-MN) announced she is endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s (I-VT) 2020 campaign in a statement Tuesday night, becoming the first \u201cSquad\u201d member to publicly confirm their reported plans to endorse the socialist senator after his heart attack.\n\n\u201cBernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography,\u201d Omar said in a statement distributed by the Sanders campaign.\n\n\u2018That is why he is fighting for a humane immigration policy that treats immigrants as human beings and not criminals. And it\u2019s why Bernie is fighting to end our forever wars and truly prioritize human rights in our foreign policy\u2014no matter who violates them. And it\u2019s why I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d the progressive lawmaker concluded.\n\nOmar\u2019s endorsement follows reports from the Washington Post and CNN stating Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) are planning to endorse Sanders\u2019s White House bid at the senator\u2019s first rally since suffering a heart attack two weeks ago.\n\nNew: Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib will also endorse Sanders, according to source. AOC will, as @daveweigel and @WaPoSean first reported, will do the same on Saturday in NYC. \u2014 Greg Krieg (@GregJKrieg) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to Saturday,\u201d Corbin Trent, Ocasio-Cortez spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nDuring tonight\u2019s CNN-New York Times\u2019 Democrat presidential debate, Sanders floated that a \u201cspecial guest\u201d would appear alongside him at his \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d event in New York City.\n\nThe development comes after Sanders said that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a recent heart attack.\n\nThe Vermont senator backtracked in an interview with NBC News just a day after indicating that health concerns would force him to change \u201cthe nature\u201d of his campaign, in the short term, at least.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders told NBC, downplaying the impact of the heat attack, which required him to be rushed to the hospital where he received two stents to clear a clogged artery in his heart.\n\n\u201cPeople should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cPeople should think that according to the doctors I\u2019m on the way to a full recovery.\u201d\n\nThe 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist was hospitalized after experiencing chest discomfort while campaigning in Las Vegas last week. His staff initially said the stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing only two days later that he had had a heart attack.\n\nSanders told NBC it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest his staff hadn\u2019t been forthright about his condition. He said he was still talking to doctors and trying to understand what was going on.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Ilhan Omar is the first \"Squad\" member to publicly confirm their reported plans to endorse Bernie Sanders after his heart attack.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177308078-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
