Calling online bullying a \u201cglobal epidemic,\" she said she helped create the video \u2014 which came with a trigger warning \u2014 to shine a light on how people, especially kids, may be silently be dealing with it, noting, \"It can be hard to see the signs.\u201d\n\n89th Academy Awards - Oscars Vanity Fair Party - Beverly Hills, California, U.S. - 26/02/17 \u2013 TV personality Monica Lewinsky. REUTERS/Danny Moloshok More\n\nHaving been bullied herself stemming from her sexual relationship with President Clinton as a White House intern \u2014 which led to the impeachment investigation against Clinton led by prosecutor Kenneth Starr \u2014 Lewinsky was asked if the current impeachment investigation into Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings triggers her emotionally. (She has spoken publicly about her depression stemming from the public bullying and shaming she faced amid scandal as well as admitted she contemplated suicide.)\n\n\"Impeachment is a constitutional crisis, it's much bigger than me.

Of course...I've become the punch-line of a joke a little bit more than normal.\" - @MonicaLewinsky pic.twitter.com/pq25X5C2A3 \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cImpeachment is a constitutional crisis, right? So obviously it\u2019s much bigger than me,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut am I affected personally? Sure. Of course. I mean people are making comparisons to when Bill Clinton was impeached. I\u2019ve become a punchline of a joke a little bit more than normal. And I\u2019ve found myself the last few weeks \u2014 I\u2019m certainly more sensitive. Some people in my world might say cranky. I\u2019ve needed more self-care but the truth is if we\u2019re talking seriously about impeachment, it actually means we\u2019re all affected in the country.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with People magazine, she expressed a similar sentiment, admitting that she\u2019s \u201cbeen a little more on edge\u201d as the impeachment inquiry dominates the news. But she also told the magazine it\u2019s \u201cbigger than any one person,\u201d saying, \u201cYes, this is hard for me but I don\u2019t want to give anyone the impression that in the scheme of things I think that matters... It\u2019s far bigger and greater than me.\u201d\n\nLewinsky, who has given talks and written extensively about the pain she felt amid the scandal, expressed worry for what was happening in Washington, D.C. beyond just the impeachment.\n\n\u201cI worry that because of the behavior we are seeing come out of D.C. these days, that hate speech, cyberbullying and online harassment are not only being modeled for our young people but that the frequency and level of vitriol becoming the norm,\u201d Lewinsky told People. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay,\u201d referring to the president\u2019s frequent witter tirades and attacks.\n\nLewinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Epidemic\u201d is timed with National Bullying Prevention Month. While you view it on a screen \u2014 there is also a mobile component where the viewer gets the texts that the young woman in it was sent, making for an even deeper impact.\n\nstop scrolling and watch this film about a devastating epidemic that\u2019s going unnoticed. #TheEpidemic [Trigger Warning.

But make no mistake; there are real, offline consequences that range from bad to grave. With \u2018The Epidemic\u2019 we're working to build vital awareness, help people learn empathy through experience and remind anyone who is being bullied: please don't suffer in silence.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
