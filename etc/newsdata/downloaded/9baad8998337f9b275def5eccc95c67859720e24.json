His lawyer, Jonathan Bach of Shapiro Arato Bach, told Deadline that \u201cMr. Rose vehemently denies and will vigorously contest these (most recent) allegations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong other things, the allegations in the complaint are completely inconsistent with written statements made by the plaintiff to Mr. Rose, including \u2018I love working for you at your show, and would love to be part of any show that you host,\u2019 \u2018I consider it an honor to be a member of your team,\u2019 and \u2018hope to see you more often! Please stop by anytime\u2019 \u201c, Bach said revealing texts Rose allegedly received from the plaintiff between 2010 and 2012.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiggi said she added Bloomberg to the complaint because the media and financial information company ignored Rose's increasingly inappropriate behavior.\n\n\u201cBloomberg supervisors personally observed Mr. Rose\u2019s behavior on countless occasions, and received numerous complaints from female staff about Mr. Rose over the years,\u201d Riggi claims in the complaint, adding that Bloomberg considered her an independent contractor and not a full-time employee. \u201cIn some instances, Bloomberg supervisors experienced the harassment themselves. Despite substantial notice of Mr. Rose\u2019s behavior for many years, Bloomberg refused to address or remediate it, dismissing it, in words or effect, as \u2018Just Charlie being Charlie.'\u201d\n\nRose was fired from CBS and had his interview show \"Charlie Rose\" canceled by PBS just a day after the first sexual harassment claims against him in 2017. After Rose\u2019s show was canceled, Riggi alleges she was let go from Bloomberg -- which still features videos of interviews Rose conducted with the likes of musician Macklemore and actor Harrison Ford on its web site -- without severance or other unemployment benefits because she had been classified as an independent contractor. She is seeking damages and equitable relief for the harm she claims she endured emotionally and financially working for Rose.\n\n\u201cAt no time was the plaintiff an employee of ours,\u201d said Bloomberg spokesman Ty Trippet on Friday of Riggi\u2019s filing and claims. \u201cWe understand that the plaintiff was a contractor of Charlie Rose Inc., and given that they operated independently of us, any of her compensation would have been handled solely by Charlie Rose Inc.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Disgraced ex-CBS News host Charlie Rose is being sued again for sexual harassment by a former makeup artist less than a year after the company settled a handful of similar claims against him.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/dfb7c489-Charlie20Rose201280x720.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
