The front-rower went on to have a decorated career, for various leading clubs and his country, but his wild offence in November 1990 guaranteed him a permanent seat at the top-table of infamy.\n\nFederico Mendez was sent off for Argentina against England after punching Paul Ackford\n\nEven now, people stop him to talk about the incident.\n\nSpeaking to Sportsmail from his home in Mendoza, Mendez said: 'I am asked about it many, many times!\n\n'In the streets, sometimes in London, or sometimes in Argentina, people still remember that.\n\nIt was one of the trademarks of my career. It was an iconic punch \u2014 and that was before social media.'\n\nWhen he recounts the tale, it provides a stark illustration of how much the game has changed.\n\nBack in those pre-professional days, open warfare between packs was common.\n\nWhen teams such as England and Argentina \u2014 both armed with powerful forwards \u2014 locked horns, there was always likely to be trouble.\n\nThe Pumas prop admitted the attack was a case of mistaken identity and he lost his head\n\nAs there was when Mendez encountered England prop Jeff Probyn. 'Probyn thought that I'd grabbed at his balls, so he kicked me in the head, and I just reacted,' Mendez said.\n\n'I punched Paul Ackford, who had absolutely nothing to do with it. The first white jersey I saw, I just punched him. That was it. I had to go off.\n\n'I just went completely out of my head. My mind blew \u2014 I wasn't even thinking. Of course, nowadays, you are not allowed to do that, because your career would be finished.\n\n'As I walked off, I was saying to myself how stupid I was and that I would never be called to play for the Pumas again. That was my fear. I had had a rush of blood and I was regretting it. I was very scared.\n\n'But I was just a boy and everyone understood how young I was, with the way they reacted. I was looked after. It was very important to me that they understood I wasn't in control when I reacted.'\n\nThe prop would go on to have a successful career with 75 caps and two Heineken Cups\n\nThe notoriety from that day was hard to shake off. Eight years later, Mendez was playing for Bath against London Scottish, whose flanker Simon Fenn needed several stitches after having his ear bitten.\n\nThe entire Bath front row \u2014 Mendez, Kevin Yates and Victor Ubogu \u2014 were cited by their opponents. Eventually, Mendez and Ubogu were cleared. Yates was banned for six months.\n\n'Kevin Yates was ear-biting one of the players and it was a big thing,' said Mendez. 'I was cited for that and nothing happened, but everyone reminds me of that occasion.\n\n'Actually, Paul Ackford was writing for a newspaper and he did an article against me. I came back to him and said, \"It wasn't me, but if I find you in the street I'm going to punch you again!\"\n\nThe 1982 Falklands War between Britain and Argentina provided added tension on the field during Mendez's career. He is glad that modern players from his country regard this merely as a high-stakes sporting rivalry, without the wider connotations.\n\n'Everyone in Argentina knows that was a stupid war done by stupid military politicans,' he said.\n\n'Nowadays, everything is 100 per cent fine with England. Of course you want to beat them on the field, but it is no more than that.'\n\nMendez insisted that Argentina are capable of producing World Cup shock against England\n\nAfter calling time on a playing career which yielded 75 Test caps, plus the distinction of winning the Heineken Cup with two different English clubs \u2014 Bath and Northampton \u2014 Mendez was coaching his local club and province until a few years ago.\n\nNow, while running real estate and security businesses, he follows rugby as a fan whose nephew has become established in Argentina's Under 20s.\n\nMendez, 47, recognises the calibre of Eddie Jones's England team, but believes the Pumas can trouble them, in a legitimate way.\n\n'England have five or six players who could be in any World XV. They are candidates to win the World Cup. But Argentina are a Latin nation \u2014 and in Latin rugby nations, things can change very quickly.\n\n'If Argentina can put everything together, I really think they can put big pressure on England. It is not an impossible task.'\n\nIf they are to have a chance of causing an upset, the Pumas will need to keep 15 men on the field. For all their talk of waging war, actual fighting is now a history lesson.", "description": "INTERVIEW BY CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO: England have been warned to expect a 'war' against Argentina, in a fixture which has often featured volatile, violent rivalry.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/21/19313372-0-image-a-34_1570219253332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
