REUTERS/Costas Baltas\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Mario Draghi ignored advice from the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee not to resume bond purchases, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, shedding more light on how divisive the move was.\n\nThe ECB pledged indefinite bond purchases in September, even as more than a third of the rate-setting Governing Council opposed the move, an unusually high level of dissent for a body that normally strives for consensus.\n\nThe monetary policy committee - made up of technocrats mostly from the euro zone\u2019s 19 central banks - sent a letter to Draghi and other Governing Council members several days before the meeting, advising against fresh bond buys, the FT cited three members of the council as saying.\n\nAlthough the committee\u2019s advice is not binding, there have only been a handful of occasions during Draghi\u2019s eight-year tenure that the Governing Council went against it, the FT added.\n\nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe ECB will start bond purchases, at 20 billion euros per month, on Nov 1.", "description": "European Central Bank President Mario Draghi ignored advice from the bank's monetary policy committee not to resume bond purchases, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, shedding more light on how divisive the move was.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439167594&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990GN", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
