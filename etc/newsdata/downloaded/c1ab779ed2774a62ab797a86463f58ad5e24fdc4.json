(Oct. 10) AP\n\nAngelina Jolie is speaking candidly about how she grappled with re-discovering Maleficent for the follow-up to the 2014 film.\n\n\"It was a tough time,\u201d the Oscar-winning actress admitted to People magazine of slipping back into the role for \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,\" in theaters Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been coming off a few years of difficulty, and I was not feeling very strong,\" she added. \"In fact, I was feeling pretty broken. It took me a moment to feel the strength of (Maleficent) again.\u201d\n\nJolie, 44, did not expand to the entertainment news outlet on the difficulty she experienced. It is worth noting that she filed for divorce from her long-time love Brad Pitt in 2016 after two years of marriage. \"This decision was made for the health of the family,\" Robert Offer, an attorney for Jolie, told USA TODAY in a statement at the time.\n\nReview: Angelina Jolie's 'Maleficent 2' is like a dark and magical 'Meet the Fockers'\n\nAngelina Jolie fought to find the perfect Russian Red lips in 'Maleficent 2'\n\nAngelina Jolie as Maleficent (Photo: Disney via AP)\n\nThe former pair have six children \u2013 Maddox, 18; Pax, 15; Zahara, 14; Shiloh, 13; and twins Vivienne and Knox, 11 \u2013 who were at the center of a custody dispute. Jolie wanted sole physical custody, while Pitt desired to to share physical custody.\n\nIn court documents from August 2018, Jolie's attorneys alleged Pitt hadn't paid any \"meaningful\" child support for a year and a half and she planned to seek a court order for retroactive funds. Pitt hit back, asserting in court documents that he loaned Jolie $8 million for her current Los Angeles residence and has paid over $1.3 million in bills for her and the children.\n\nAngelina Jolie's kids steal the show at 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' premiere\n\nBrad Pitt talks sobriety, Alcoholics Anonymous: 'I removed my drinking privileges'\n\nBrad Pitt talks Trump tweets, being a better dad and crying in 'Ad Astra'\n\nAngelina Jolie with four of her six kids: Vivienne, Zahara, Shiloh and Knox Jolie-Pitt at the \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" premiere in central London on Oct. 9, 2019.

Director Joachim Ronning said \"hours and hours\" were spent discussing the character's lipstick choice.\n\n\"I felt in the first film, (the lips) were a bit saturated,\" he told USA TODAY. \"I wanted to make them feel a little more natural, a little cooler and darker \u2013 but keeping them the red, red, red.\"\n\nRonning says he and Jolie went back and forth before agreeing upon the film's no-shine MAC Matte Russian Red lipstick.\n\n\"It's so important to her. So it was pretty much Angelina and I, battling it out. But at the end of the day, we agreed. We changed the color a bit,\" says Ronning, who notes that the decision ultimately rested with Jolie, one of the film's producers. \"When she gets happy, then I get happy. That\u2019s the order of things.\"\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell, Maria Puente and Bryan Alexander\n\n'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' first reactions: Critics praise Angelina Jolie's 'fierce fairytale'\n\nAngelina Jolie explaining her emotional farewell to college-bound Maddox will make you cry\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/16/angelina-jolie-struggle-reprise-maleficent-after-feeling-pretty-broken/3996015002/", "description": "\"It was a tough time,\u201d Angelina Jolie said in a new interview of slipping back into the role for \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,\" in theaters Friday.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Published A.M.
