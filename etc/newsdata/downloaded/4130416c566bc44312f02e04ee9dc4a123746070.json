He\u2019s familiar with fame, having been an internet sensation since high school.\n\n\u201cI feel like when he dunks and does all that, you\u2019ve seen that since he was like 16 years old,\u201d Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday said. \u201cOne thing that surprised me was his maturity - his maturity level off the court, being able to handle these types of situations and come in with so much hype and still be able to go out there and perform.\u201d\n\nOr as Williamson puts it: \u201cI\u2019m just playing a game I love.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to know about the New Orleans\u2019 2019-20 campaign:\n\nNEW ERA\n\nThe Pelicans, who\u2019ve missed the playoffs three off the past four seasons, have been looking forward to a fresh start since six-time All-Star and 2012 No.1 overall draft choice Anthony Davis requested a trade in late January.\n\nThey started by replacing former general manager Dell Demps with new Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations David Griffin, who\u2019d led Cleveland\u2019s front office during the Cavaliers\u2019 2016 NBA championship.\n\nGriffin arrived looking to bring in a bounty of promising young players in exchange for Davis. He gained more leverage than expected when the Pelicans won the NBA\u2019s draft lottery - and the right to select Williamson.\n\nNew Orleans ultimately dealt Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for a major haul: 2016 second overall draft pick Brandon Ingram, 2017 No. 2 overall pick Lonzo Ball, 2017 late first-round pick Josh Hart and three first-round draft picks. Those picks include the fourth overall this year, which Griffin trade so he could select Texas center Jaxson Hayes eighth overall and Virginia Tech guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker 17th.\n\nHaving accumulated all that youth, Griffin made a trade with Utah for veteran center Derrick Favors and signed free-agent guard J.J. Redick.\n\nLINEUP CHANGES\n\nHoliday, whom Griffin calls the Pelicans\u2019 \u201cbest player,\u201d is expected to be the only returning player in the starting lineup.\n\n\u201cJrue is a perfect conduit for us between the young guys and some of our veteran leaders,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nThe 29-year old guard, who has been among the club\u2019s top scorers and defenders in recent seasons, is expected to be joined by Ball at point guard, along with Ingram, Williamson and Favors in the front court.\n\nHow that lineup stacks up in the Western Conference remains to be seen. In the meantime, Griffin is preaching patience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an unbelievably difficult conference. We\u2019re going to take some lumps,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWhat we do after that is all that really matters.\u201d\n\nREDICK\u2019S ROLE\n\nRedick looks likely to be a top reserve in his 14th season. A 41 percent career 3-point shooter, he should draw defenders to the perimeter and give players like Williamson more space to operate inside.\n\nGriffin said he also values Redick\u2019s veteran presence in the locker room.\n\n\u201cOur style of play lends itself very well to the way he plays the game, but our roster lends itself to the leadership component he brings,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nZION\u2019S ZEAL\n\nWhile Williamson is bound to find NBA defenses more nuanced and challenging during the regular season, he doesn\u2019t downplay his ability to contribute.\n\n\u201cI can see myself being a big play-maker for this team, like attacking the basket, making open passes and just improving on my jumper,\u201d Williamson said, adding that he believes his perimeter shooting is underestimated.\n\n\u201cPeople kind of over exaggerate the whole \u2018can\u2019t shoot\u2019 thing,\u201d Williamson said after hitting a 3-pointer in his third preseason game. \u201cIf they want to leave me open, I\u2019m going to shoot every time.\u201d\n\nPelicans executives, coaches and players have effusively praised Williamson for an unselfish, team-first approach that they find refreshing for a player who has been such a magnet for attention.\n\n\u201cHe wants to win,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s the main thing for him. He doesn\u2019t care about exposure.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Zion Williamson celebrated a recent alley-oop dunk with an ebullient smile and a flexed left bicep as an energized crowd roared approvingly.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/jazz_pelicans_basketball_91282_c0-112-2691-1681_s1200x700.jpg?d84080f5d874a5148f3d9b5fc7a69f5f92d54673", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
