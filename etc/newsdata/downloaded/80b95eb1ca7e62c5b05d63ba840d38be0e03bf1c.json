Their aim, he wrote in a Washington Post Op-Ed, was to \"neutralize\" a longstanding threat against Turkish citizens and to \"liberate\" the local population.\n\nThe escalation comes three days after the White House announced that it would pull back troops from northeast Syria to make way for a long-planned Turkish operation. The White House said Turkey would now be responsible for all captured ISIS fighters in the area.\n\nThe announcement brought a wave of criticism from around the world, including from Republicans as well as Democrats in the U.S., that the American governmentwas abandoning its Kurdish allies.\n\nNews\n\nThe SDF has been a crucial U.S. ally in the war against ISIS and currently controls much of the area close to the border with Turkey. It says its forces have lost 11,000 fighters in that struggle.\n\nOvernight, as Kurdish fighters braced themselves for a Turkish invasion, the SDF reported that ISIS sleeper cells had launched three attacks on its security bases in the city of Raqqa. NBC News could not independently confirm the attacks.\n\nReports of the attacks followed a warning from a top Kurdish general on Mondaythat fighters assigned to guard thousands of ISIS captives were rushing to the border ahead of an expected Turkish attack. It also came after analysts told NBC News that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the area and a Turkish invasion would be a \"godsend\" for the Islamist militants.\n\n\"ISIS is no more the priority,\" Bali said. \"We fought ISIS for years; now we have to look after ourselves.\"\n\nTurkish soldiers drive towards the border with Syria near Akcakale in Sanliurfa province on Tuesday. Bulent Kilic\n\nThe SDF called on the international community on Wednesday to implement a no-fly zone over the area to protect civilians from attack, similar to what was done for Kurds in Iraq. In 1991, the U.S. enforced a no-fly zone over northern Iraq to protect the Kurds from a brutal crackdown by Saddam Hussein's armies.\n\nAn SDF official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of safety concerns, told NBC News on Tuesday that its fighters expect Turkish-aligned Islamist factions to enter Syria first, followed by the Turkish military.\n\nTurkey, which sees the Kurdish-led forces as terrorists who threaten the integrity of its country, used a similar tactic when it moved into the Kurdish-enclave of Afrin early last year, displacing some 300,000 people.", "description": "\"We are and we have to be prepared for the worst,\" said the spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, as pictures appear to show Turkish forces amassing on the border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4219572/1000x563_nbc-191009-turkey-troops-border-mc-9073_473db0a690052cdf959d0c3478e16e22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
