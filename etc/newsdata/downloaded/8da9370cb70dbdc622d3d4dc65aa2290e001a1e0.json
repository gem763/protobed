As I entered the big black door of No 10, I looked up at the window and saw \u2014 horror of horrors \u2014 a tabby cat giving me the evil eye. I\u2019ve discovered that this is Larry, the boss of Downing Street. When I get a bit bigger, I\u2019ll remind him how things work with dogs and cats\n\nSmarter than shaggy Boris: Later in the day, I focused on ignoring that cat. My mum, Carrie, is lovely and cuddly, while my Dad, Boris, seems pretty cool, too \u2014 although he should get his fur groomed. He\u2019s looking a bit shaggy. He kept muttering about Brexits. I think they\u2019re a kind of biscuit. But check out my new threads: a smart new red scarf. I\u2019ve also got a great big house with a huge garden and more Persian rugs to pee on than I can count\n\nI can't stay pup all night: It wasn't that long ago that I was just a humble, wonky-jawed scruff rescued from a puppy farm in Carmarthenshire \u2014 but just look at me now. I am one lucky pup. And I\u2019m getting used to this life of luxury. On night one, I couldn\u2019t wait to get in my basket (after updating my Instagram account, of course). Night all\n\nA perfect pick-me-up from my mum and dad: Such a crazy day. I went down to the garden with Mum and Dad while lots of people took my photograph. Later, I met Bailey, a cavapoo who lives next door with her dad, Saj. She\u2019s pretty clever, and almost as cute as me. Later, I cuddled up to Mum and Dad on the sofa and we watched 101 Dalmatians. Dad started chortling when Cruella de Vil came on and he told me Cruella used to live at No.10\n\nElection winners and snoozers: September 14 \u2014 At breakfast today, Dad was bending Mum\u2019s ear about someone called Dave. Bailey said he used to belong to a family called the Camerons who lived here before. \u2018Is he coming back?\u2019 I asked Bailey. \u2018The Camerons are never coming back to Downing Street.\u2019 \u2018So what\u2019s the problem?\u2019 I asked. \u2018It all goes back to the Bullingdon Club,\u2019 said Bailey enigmatically. I needed a snooze on Mummy\u2019s jumper after all that gossip\n\nIt's time for a big tear-up: September 18 \u2014 Today we watched something on telly called the Supreme Court. It wasn\u2019t very exciting but Mum and Dad were glued to the spectacle. In fact, Dad was looking a bit worried. I thought I had done something wrong. Not wishing to disappoint him, I decided to tear apart the best part of a toilet roll before anyone even noticed. But at least I\u2019ve learned a new word \u2014 \u2018prorogue\u2019. I\u2019ve heard it a lot more recently than my favourite words \u2014 walkies and din-dins\n\nLooking like Jack the lad: Tonight, I had my first official engagement. I got all dressed up in a Union Jack scarf to meet a gathering of military personnel. I was a bit nervous, but Mum was brilliant and kept me cuddled up to her the whole night and tickled my tummy. I didn\u2019t have to do anything apart from look cute, which I\u2019m really brilliant at. People seemed much more excited to meet me than Dad\n\nSomeone's in the doghouse (but not me): September 30 \u2014 Daddy doesn\u2019t like the Sunday papers. They make Mummy shout at him. Last week, she went potty about someone called Jennifer Arcuri and then this week she was going on about someone called Charlotte Edwardes. Today, the housekeeper sneaked in and removed the plates from the kitchen (and had a go at the wine stains on the sofa). I\u2019m on my best behaviour at the moment", "description": "Adorable Jack Russell Dilyn has settled into life at No.10 after cute photos have emerged of the cross rescue puppy dressed in a Union Jack scarf and snoozing.
