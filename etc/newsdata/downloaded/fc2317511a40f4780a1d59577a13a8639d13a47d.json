Greta Thunberg in Berlin in July. Photo: ddp images/SIPA USA/ddp images\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nWhen Greta Thunberg stepped onboard the Malizia II \u2014 a 60-foot racing yacht owned by the royal family of Monaco \u2014 it had been less than a year since she first walked out of school as an unknown, awkward, nearly friendless 15-year-old making a lonely protest outside the Swedish Parliament against her country\u2019s absolute indifference to the climate crisis, which she saw in uncannily black-and-white terms. She painted her now-iconic sign in those colors, which she carried across the Atlantic on the two-week carbon-free journey she documented periodically on social media. Black capital letters on white: SKOLSTREJK F\u00d6R KLIMATET (or \u201cSchool Strike for Climate\u201d).\n\nBy the time she stepped off the yacht in New York on August 28, two weeks after she\u2019d set sail from Plymouth, England, wobbly legged from the weeks at sea as she walked to address a crowd of many hundreds, she had become something even more unusual than an adolescent protester or even a generational icon. She was the Joan of Arc of climate change, commanding a global army of teenage activists numbering in the millions and waging a rhetorical war against her elders through the unapologetic use of generational shame.\n\nThe comparison might seem hyperbolic and may come to look even more strained than that, depending on what the future brings for Greta and for climate action. But for the moment, there is simply no other appropriate analogy from political history to draw on in describing just how much she has achieved at such a young age and in so little time. (Even Malala Yousafzai, now a student at Oxford, was celebrated more in newsmagazines and on conference stages than in the streets.) In a way that is perhaps possible only in the social-media age, Greta has become almost a synecdoche for the global climate movement: its mascot, its theorist, its revolutionary, and a representative \u201cvictim\u201d of generational malice. A well-off white girl, she has even been called out by fellow activists for embodying the movement\u2019s blind spots and shortcomings \u2014 though she has been conscientious, in ascending the world stage, to praise the work of all the other teens striking from school now each Friday.\n\nWithin four months of beginning her strike, Greta had spoken at the U.N.\u2019s climate-change conference in Katowice, Poland, excoriating the crowd for its nihilistic self-interest:\n\nYou only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children. But I don\u2019t care about being popular. I care about climate justice and the living planet. Our civilization is being sacrificed for the opportunity of a very small number of people to continue making enormous amounts of money.\n\nThe language was hot, relatively speaking, but Greta has Asperger\u2019s, and her delivery was cool, flat, almost blank in its affect \u2014 somehow flatter even when performed aloud before an audience than when read on the page.\n\nThe year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children, maybe they will spend that day with me. Maybe they will ask me about you. Maybe they will ask why you didn\u2019t do anything while there still was time to act. You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\n\nA month later, at the World Economic Forum\u2019s orgy of plutocratic comity at Davos, where she traveled by train and slept in a small tent in the Swiss winter, she used even more direct language:\n\nAdults keep saying we owe it to the young people to give them hope. But I don\u2019t want your hope. I don\u2019t want you to be hopeful; I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act, I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if the house was on fire, because it is.\n\nIn March, an estimated 1.4 million schoolchildren did just that, following Greta\u2019s lead, walking out of classrooms and marching in cities and towns around the world: 300,000 students in Germany, 200,000 in Italy, 150,000 in Quebec. There were strikes in Delhi, Seoul, and Cape Town; London and San Francisco and Washington, D.C.; Melbourne and Brussels, Lisbon and Taipei, and Quezon City in the Philippines, and Kenya and Namibia and Ghana; Edinburgh and Dublin and Sydney and Prague; Paris and Reykjav\u00edk and Tokyo. Greta stayed home, leading the strike in Stockholm. She had only just turned 16.\n\nI don\u2019t want you to be hopeful; I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.\n\nBut the strikes themselves are only part of what Greta has achieved. In February, the president of the European Commission committed to spending fully a quarter of the E.U. budget on climate mitigation over seven years, following a meeting with her. And shortly after she visited the British Parliament, its Conservative majority voted to declare a climate emergency, then promised it would zero out on its carbon emissions by 2050 (and this amid the long, consuming drama of Brexit).\n\nThese were just pledges and may soon prove illusory, like every other pledge that has ever been made to fight climate change. But all are far more ambitious than would have seemed even conceivable a year ago. After all, when Greta began her school strike, late in August 2018, the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had not yet released its \u201cdoomsday\u201d SR15 report, which would arrive that October festooned with alarm bells and produce a sea change in public concern; the British protest movement Extinction Rebellion had not yet launched, which it would in November, blockading five bridges across the Thames and effectively stopping traffic in parts of London; hardly any American had heard of the Sunrise movement, which would make itself known when it occupied Dianne Feinstein\u2019s Senate office in February 2019 and later forced two single-issue climate town halls onto the Democratic primary calendar; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had not yet been elected to Congress or introduced the crusade toward a Green New Deal. It has been a dizzying year for climate mobilization, in other words, and improbably but inarguably, Greta Thunberg has become its face.\n\nArriving in Davos, Switzerland, to protest outside of the World Economic Forum.

In the photos she shared on Twitter and Instagram along the way, Greta looked not entirely comfortable at sea. In New York, where she disembarked from the boat at Brookfield Place\u2019s glitzy North Cove Marina, she took the stage wearing blister-revealing Crocs and a two-piece, water-resistant matte-black sailing outfit, printed on the back like an athletic jersey with her name (GRETA), as though anyone onboard or off would need help identifying her. On the front, a nameplate read G. THUNBERG, as it would on a military uniform. The crowd that welcomed her was made up of television and print media, activists pumping in the air signs like THERE IS NO PLANET B, and proud parents and teenage climate strikers she\u2019d inspired, singing in rounds, to the tune of \u201cFr\u00e8re Jacques,\u201d \u201cWelcome, Greta, welcome, Greta / To New York.\u201d\n\nGreta hung back nervously as she was introduced by two local climate strikers: Alexandria Villase\u00f1or, a 14-year-old who moved to New York from California last fall for a single school year while her mother pursued a master\u2019s degree at Columbia and quickly started striking weekly in front of the U.N., inspired by Greta\u2019s December call to action, and Xiye Bastida-Patrick, a 17-year-old from Mexico who moved to the U.S. because of her parents\u2019 work on climate change and whose phone bore the sticker GRETA HAS A POSSE. Onstage, both towered over Greta, each more charismatic and typically adolescent in their affect than the headliner \u2014 a little more demonstrative, burning with considerably more performative righteousness as they addressed the crowd. \u201cAll of this is very overwhelming,\u201d Greta said when she finally took the microphone. Losing her train of thought, she apologized: \u201cMy brain isn\u2019t working correctly.\u201d\n\nGreta has delivered 12 speeches in her short but very public life, now packaged together in a Penguin paperback called No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference. But they have all been relatively quick, her interviews often briefer, and while she is regularly enveloped by supporters during climate strikes, she seems generally uncomfortable in crowds. \u201cGreta\u2019s in the middle there, looking miserable,\u201d a reporter whispered to me, a few days later, when she joined Villase\u00f1or\u2019s weekly climate strike at the U.N.\n\nHer natural medium \u2014 as it is for many celebrities roughly of her generation \u2014 is the controlled stage of social media. There, she has called her atypicality a \u201csuperpower\u201d and has been quite open and unguarded about the details: As a young child, she says, she was diagnosed not only with Asperger\u2019s but obsessive-compulsive disorder and what\u2019s called \u201cselective mutism.\u201d Beginning at age 11, seized by a deep depression about the fate of the world, she stopped talking and eating. That has led, she says, to the stunted growth that today gives her the appearance of a preteen, a wise-beyond-her-years golden child.\n\nThis atypicality has not proved, as you might have expected, a challenge in her public life. In fact, the plot points of Greta\u2019s rise could have been lifted from Joseph Campbell: an Everygirl turned reluctant crusader, a dark night of the soul, a forbidding and intrepid journey from the imperial periphery to the very center of global power. The saga was irresistible. And as was the case for the Parkland students who originally inspired her strike with their protests against gun violence in the U.S., Greta serves as a wish-fulfillment fantasy for members of an older generation, the one she so pointedly and repeatedly calls out, who seem desperate to believe in a next-generation savior \u2014 and who seemed gratified to be flagellated a little bit for their selfishness and shortsightedness.\n\nAlong the way, Greta\u2019s childlike clarity has been her best and most unique asset \u2014 fortifying her moral standing and underlining the standing of her generation as a whole. She has been alive for fully a third of all the carbon emissions ever produced in the entire history of humanity, yet she is only now truly coming into political consciousness, just as the window for avoiding catastrophic warming is, the scientists tell her, almost closed. Perhaps for this reason, too, she does not appear to be grandstanding, even when she is.\n\nThat she delivers her message with such direct, uninflected matter-of-factness is another aspect of her disarming rhetorical power. Unlike alarmist activist groups like Extinction Rebellion, she cannot be accused of hyperbolic license in her presentation of the state of the science \u2014 they say the U.N. understates the crisis; she takes its reports at face value. Unlike policy-makers like Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Bernie Sanders, and those working on Green New Deal legislation, she cannot be faulted for pushing \u201ctoo fast,\u201d however necessary change may be, because she is not advocating any particular policy at all, merely describing the problem as scientists do and showcasing the failure of leaders to do much, yet, about it \u2014 a failure anyone with eyes can plainly see. And unlike climate celebrities like Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio, she cannot be attacked as a hypocrite, because she is already living an exemplary low-carbon life \u2014 abjuring plane travel, going vegan, denouncing consumerism.\n\nGreta\u2019s visit to New York was occasioned by two essentially simultaneous but in other ways counterpoised events. There is the U.N.\u2019s Climate Action Summit, beginning September 23, where many nations are expected to unveil new emissions-reductions commitments more ambitious than the ones they have all, to this point, failed to meet, and the Global Climate Strike, on September 20 and September 27, the first of its kind to invite adults to join the ranks of schoolchildren and walk out of work. There will be strikes in at least 500 places in the U.S. thanks to the organizing efforts of other teenage leaders, from Villase\u00f1or and Bastida-Patrick to 13-year-old Haven Coleman and 17-year-old Jamie Margolin, among others. (\u201cMany activists stand in the shadow, not being focused on, highlighted, being appreciated for what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Greta told me.) And there will be thousands more strikes elsewhere in the world. Which means Greta will have flanked with disruptive politics the whole project of addressing climate change through the existing, elite-governed order \u2014 though of course she will be a star attraction at the U.N. events that week too.\n\nAt the pier in Battery Park City, teenagers waiting for Greta to arrive burst now and again into call-and-response chants: \u201cShow me what democracy looks like,\u201d followed by \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d But a strike, of course, is what you do when conventional politics has failed. The summit, like all U.N. activity on climate change, is aimed at stabilizing the planet\u2019s temperature safely below two degrees of warming. At that level, a recently leaked U.N. report suggested, climate change would increase damages from storms and sea-level rise a hundred times over, displacing at least 280 million people. Already, the planet\u2019s landmasses, which warm faster than its oceans, have surpassed 1.5 degrees. A report published in September found large parts of the ocean too had already hit that threshold of warming.\n\nThe stated goal is to keep global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. Practically speaking, by the time her yacht carried Greta into New York, that ship had already sailed. Nevertheless, she arrived buoyed by a kind of unpersuadable relentlessness of purpose, one that could almost look like optimism, it so contrasts with the reflexive resignation of so many older than she.\n\nGreta in Stockholm.

They deserve to have air-conditioning. They\u2019re getting very high wet-bulb temperatures. Jesus Christ, by 2070 there could be just a massive number of people dropping dead in the streets.\u201d\n\nGates is, famously, a techno-optimist. In recent years, the Gates Foundation has focused more on climate change, and he is, as an investor, behind a lot of the most ambitious work being done on next-generation nuclear power (critical to making new plants affordable), battery storage (critical to making intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar truly scalable), and carbon-capture technology (critical if we hope to take enough carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to bring carbon concentration back under catastrophic levels). But on innovation he cites more pessimistic thinkers. \u201cThe greatest expert on energy is Vaclav Smil,\u201d Gates said, echoing praise he has offered elsewhere for the iconoclastic Canadian academic and author of Energy and Civilization. \u201cWhenever you spend time with Vaclav, he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh yeah? You\u2019re going to do what in 20 years?\u2019 \u201d\n\nI called Smil. His new book, Growth, closes with the line \u201cThe long-term survival of our civilization cannot be assured without setting \u2026 limits on a planetary scale.\u201d When I put the question of two degrees to him, he literally laughed: \u201cTo make that happen, you are talking about billions and billions of tons of everything. We are mining now more than 7 billion tons of coal. So you want to lower the coal consumption by half, you have to cut down close to 4 billion tons of coal. You have to get rid of more than 2 billion tons of oil. These are transformations on a billion-ton scale globally. They cannot be done by next Monday.\u201d\n\nNaomi Klein, the leftist and climate activist, was more hopeful but still called the goal of staying below two degrees \u201ca moon shot.\u201d When I asked Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the lead policy author of the Green New Deal, whether it was possible to decarbonize on the U.N. timeline, she said, \u201cThis is going to sound very dark, and I should preface it by saying \u2018I am a depressive,\u2019 but a lot of life is pain. And one of the best things you can hope for is that, in life, you have the privilege to pick what kind of pain you want.\u201d\n\nIn dozens of conversations like these in the months leading up to the U.N. summit, not a single climate leader expressed great confidence to me that we would manage to avoid two degrees of warming. That may seem like a rebuke to the clarity of purpose embedded in Greta\u2019s goals \u2014 and indeed to the whole U.N.-supported climate apparatus targeting, as she does, a safe landing at 1.5 degrees. And it does probably signal the arrival of a new era for climate politics, the post-two-degree phase, when we may stop so single-mindedly chasing quixotic temperature goals and debating how many angels have to dance on the head of a pin to get there.\n\nInstead, we can begin designing ways to limit warming beyond that level and designing ways to live best amid those conditions, which once seemed unimaginable. As nearly all of my interlocutors pointed out, by any rigorous logic, the faster arrival of catastrophic impacts argues not for fatalism but for more ambition in response, deployed more quickly and more widely, especially to protect those already suffering. Gunn-Wright told me she hardly ever thinks about the technical question of whether the U.N. timeline is plausible, so focused is she on the work of preventing more warming and more pain at any temperature level. As Klein put it, \u201cI don\u2019t see this as either we do it all or we should all just give up and drink ourselves to death. I think it all matters because every quarter-degree is hundreds of millions of lives, if not more.\u201d Then she added, \u201cThe rockier the future is, the more important it is that we become a decent society. Which we\u2019re not right now.\u201d\n\nHere is why everyone is so pessimistic: Emissions are at an all-time high, not moving too slowly in the right direction but still moving in the wrong direction, last year reaching a new peak partly because of increased energy demand arising from growing air-conditioning use for relief on all the additional punishingly hot days; staying safely below two degrees, the U.N. says, requires halving emissions globally over the next decade; those modeled pathways also require such rapid deployment of technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere that by the end of the decade, we\u2019d have to have built from scratch a carbon-capture industry at least twice and perhaps four times as large as today\u2019s oil and gas businesses, which took more than a century to develop; and they also require expanding nuclear power probably by at least 150 percent, perhaps by as much as 500 percent, by just 2050. There are other paths to climate stability than the ones drawn by the IPCC, of course, but those that feature less nuclear and less carbon capture require decarbonization to come even more quickly \u2014 perhaps, one IPCC scenario suggests, by adjusting our policy priorities away from economic growth. Even the slower, more manageable path to two degrees requires, the U.N. says, a global World War II\u2013scale mobilization. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who met Greta last December, says it needs to begin this year.\n\n2019 has been, yes, a remarkable one for climate, with all those protests and town halls, rising poll numbers for concern about climate change (ten points in a single year in the U.S.), and wind and solar power expanding around the globe (now cheaper, in many parts of it, than dirty energy). But even a climate optimist would tell you this progress isn\u2019t enough, not nearly. The rosy view is: With exploding political energy and skyrocketing policy pledges and astonishing progress with renewables, everything is moving in the right direction but time. The bleaker perspective is: We haven\u2019t even begun to dent the centuries-long trajectory of global emissions growth, and, in the form of Category 5 hurricanes stalling for days over low-lying islands and record heat waves broiling Europe three times in a single summer, the impacts are already unprecedented and beginning to overwhelm us.\n\nThe politics show it, growing only more jagged. It has been just three years now since the historic signing of the Paris climate accords, which formalized the two-degree goal, and here is what has happened in the meantime: Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, pledging to boost coal, kill wind power, and roll back environmental regulations so aggressively that the industry groups he was theoretically appealing to have objected; Jair Bolsonaro was elected president of Brazil, promising to deforest the Amazon at such a rate that scientists of his own country estimated the impact would be, over the course of a decade, equal to adding a second China and a second U.S. to the global carbon footprint, if only for a year; and Xi Jinping appointed himself president for life of China, a booming autocracy that has, just this year, proposed new coal plants to single-handedly push us past the Paris goals.\n\nWhat this means is that while Greta can look like a refreshing vision of a green future, in other ways her protest embodies the climate politics of the era now ending, when the forces of denial and delay so shaped the boundaries of political discourse that simply advocating for action and demanding we respect the science could sound, at first, like a radical gesture and perhaps sufficient. Greta knows it isn\u2019t, not anymore, which is why she has pointedly said that what she wants now is \u201ca concrete plan, not just nice words.\u201d\n\nWho Greta Met This Year (clockwise from top-left): U.N.

For most of the past year, the right wing stayed quiet about her aside from a few early attempts to dismiss her by saying she and her fellow strikers should just have stayed in school.\n\nBut beginning with the announcement that she would be traveling to the U.N. by boat \u2014 which they read as a kind of trolling, a gesture of liberal superiority \u2014 a phalanx of critics appeared and moved so much in unison you\u2019d be forgiven for seeing it as a coordinated attack. \u201cIs Greta a green prophet or a schoolgirl puppet controlled by more sinister forces behind her?\u201d asked the British Sun, a Rupert Murdoch paper. \u201cNo teenager is more freakishly influential than Thunberg, the deeply disturbed messiah of the global warming movement,\u201d the Australian columnist Andrew Bolt wrote in the Melbourne Herald Sun, another Murdoch paper. \u201cI have never seen a girl so young and with so many mental disorders treated by so many adults as a guru.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe arrival of Greta Thunberg in New York on Wednesday was one of many recent events that illustrate how rapidly modern environmentalism is degenerating into a millenarian cult,\u201d Niall Ferguson wrote in the Sunday Times of London, another Murdoch paper. And in the New York Times, the conservative centrist Christopher Caldwell called her rhetoric a threat to democracy.\n\n\u201cThis is not a \u2018woman of the year\u2019 but at best a teenager with autistic prehistory who is burned by her \u2018advisers\u2019 and by willing MSM as a new icon for the \u2018climate church,\u2019 \u201d wrote one far-right member of the German Parliament in the run-up to the European elections. The Swedish populist Jimmie \u00c5kesson described her as the creation of her parents and a PR agency, echoing a puppet narrative that has become so firm on the European right that a full-length book has already been published about the family, The Manufacturing of Greta Thunberg.\n\nI should say a second full-length book, because Greta\u2019s parents wrote their own account of their daughter\u2019s troubled childhood and climate awakening, Scenes From the Heart, first published in 2018, when Greta\u2019s mother \u2014 a successful opera singer who was once Sweden\u2019s competitor in the Eurovision Song Contest \u2014 was still the most famous member of the family. This year, they brought out a new edition with Greta\u2019s name now on the cover too. When it is published in English next year, it will be under a revised title: Our House Is On Fire.\n\nThe book is more of a parenting memoir than a hagiography of a child. In it, many elements of the Greta conspiracy theory are confirmed, but only as perhaps the most normal features of her otherwise nearly incomprehensible adolescence: She is a child of relative privilege who was taught early on about climate change by her singer mother and her sometime actor father, himself the son of a quite famous actor, who first switched to managing his wife\u2019s career, then his daughter\u2019s. He was one of the four to accompany Greta on the Malizia II, for instance, and when she camped out at Davos, and he helped nurse her through her black years, a friend of the family told me, \u201cone gnocchi at a time.\u201d In other words, Greta has been helped, and perhaps even stage-parented, in her journey, as teenagers often are even on much less dramatic missions.\n\nWhen she arrived in New York, Greta was asked what she thought she would miss about the boat now that she was back on land. Her second answer was about the beauty of the ocean; her first was about the solitude it brought. A few days later, on Twitter, she wrote, \u201cWhen haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go. And then you know you\u2019re winning!\u201d She added the hashtag #aspiepower and a photo of herself, smiling, aboard the Malizia II in New York Harbor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not public about my diagnosis to \u2018hide\u2019 behind it,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut because I know many ignorant people still see it as an \u2018illness\u2019, or something negative. And believe me, my diagnosis has limited me before.\u201d\n\nIn a third tweet, she went on: \u201cBefore I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didn\u2019t speak to anyone. I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder. All of that is gone now, since I have found a meaning, in a world that sometimes seems shallow and meaningless to so many people.\u201d\n\nShe also met President Obama and Trevor Noah.

Photo: Max Moden / TT / Sipa USA.\n\nI met Greta late on a Friday morning in early September near the U.N. at the Ford Foundation \u2014 a spectacular mid-century monolith with a towering atrium so wet with plant life that the corridors all the way up on the tenth floor smelled like the reptile house at a metropolitan zoo.\n\nWhen Greta arrived, she was carrying her sign from the strikes and looking tired, even a little sad, wearing gray sweatpants printed with stars and a short-sleeved, medium-blue T-shirt she\u2019d later layer with a sweatshirt of the same color and then a classic yellow raincoat. She wore her hair in a long, single braid and, in a couple of nervous moments, switched it from hanging over one shoulder to the other. Occasionally, between conversational breaks, she returned to the side of the room to collect her sign, held it for a moment, then set it down again.\n\nI started by making an obvious point, that she could surely not have imagined what was to happen for her when she first began striking. \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d she said, looking down and seeming very much like a teenager. \u201cI think I was \u2014 and am \u2014 still in shock about how fast it has been changing. Of course, the situation has not become better, but it feels like people are standing up and understand more the problem.\u201d Back then, she said, \u201cI just thought I will try something new because nothing else seemed to be working in the way that is required.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where it\u2019s led is incredible,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, hundreds of thousands of people all around the world \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cMillions,\u201d she interrupted.\n\n\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was some kind of invisible tipping point that no one really could predict.\u201d\n\nShe seemed genuinely surprised, still. She was sitting in the very seat of imperial American influence, after a few weeks of travel documented (and criticized) in the biggest newspapers and on the most widely watched news channels, outside the U.N., where in just a few weeks she would speak before the General Assembly, the world\u2019s most powerful body, about what she saw as a global existential crisis, a girl from Sweden who had been simply unable to square what she understood about the state of climate science with how little she saw being done in response and simply said so. \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t really deny the science anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the dissonance builds up, the difference between what people say and what people do, what politicians say and what they do, and how the media frames the situation versus how the science frames the situation. I think people are just, in a way, as I was in the beginning. Like, very \u2026\u201d Here, she paused and made a face, almost as if she were pantomiming a T. rex, to suggest how frustrated she was to not be able to find the word in English, her second language. \u201cHow do you \u2026 It\u2019s an easy word, I can\u2019t \u2026\u201d Disappointed in herself, she settled on an unsatisfying alternative: \u201cSurprised, or something like that.\u201d\n\nI asked whether she thought the public as a whole saw the crisis more clearly than they did a year or two ago.\n\n\u201cYes, I definitely think we in general see things more clearly now. That has had several reasons. Both because people seem more worried about \u2014 I mean, floods and heat waves and weather events during the last year. Just many small things adding up to each other. The SR15 report and several U.N. reports and\u201d \u2014 she gave a small laugh at the bland repetitiveness of the language \u2014 \u201cother reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you let yourself be optimistic,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat are you hoping unfolds?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m optimistic, I can just see what has happened during the last year \u2014 during the last month \u2014 and I could never dream that something like this would happen. I think no one could have predicted it, either. And I think: There is the hope.\u201d\n\nInstead I asked what more change would look like. \u201cIf we imagine a world in which the powerful are really focused on addressing this at the scale that is necessary, what kind of power structure would we be looking at?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, that is not for me to say,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I am just an uneducated teenager. I can\u2019t really speak up about things like this; no one would take me seriously. So I try not to speak about politics and that kind of \u2026 structure. I just think that we need to listen to the scientists and the experts so they can say how best to run the situation. I mean, I don\u2019t know how things are going to look like in even the near future. I don\u2019t know how the situation is going to look like in even a week from now because things can change. So I think\u2014that is both the scary part but also the hopeful, exciting part, because things can change so quickly.\u201d\n\nI changed the topic to the logistics of the next few weeks. I knew she would be heading to D.C. the following weekend to meet with lawmakers, as she had in London and Brussels and Stockholm, before returning to New York for the climate strike. Afterward, it would be on to South America with a possible showdown in Brazil with Bolsonaro along the way to Chile and the Santiago Climate Change Conference.\n\n\u201cMy ideal is that during the next month the awareness grows and the information spreads so that people in general become aware of these things. Because I think that once people are aware they will come together and put pressure on people in power.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo ignorance is the main obstacle?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThat has been my experience, that people don\u2019t know about these feedback loops or tipping points or carbon-dioxide budgets. I mean, in general, if you walk out on the street and ask a person, \u2018What is a climate feedback loop?,\u2019 they wouldn\u2019t know how to answer that. So I think that is one of the keys \u2014 to spread awareness. And to treat the climate crisis as the crisis it is, because as it is now, we are just treating it like any other political issue, and that of course minimizes it to a very small subject. We must see it for what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think if people see it that way, that will lead inevitably to some change in our policy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what I hope,\u201d she said cautiously. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think people are evil. I just think we are unaware. And that it is due to these surroundings, these circumstances around us, that make us continue like there\u2019s no tomorrow and not care about anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve spoken in the past about the selfishness of the world\u2019s powerful, the world\u2019s wealthy, people like us who live in the West, relatively well off,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you think that is just ignorance? That once people really understand the story we\u2019ll become less selfish?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what I think and hope,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIs there hope we can stay below 1.5 degrees?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe paused to collect her thoughts and answer carefully. \u201cI have spoken to many scientists who have told me about the aspects not included \u2014 what things the IPCC are not supposed to write about. But I try to stay away from personal opinions. Current best available science says it is still possible within the laws of physics to do it but not as it is now \u2014 not if we continue like we are doing now.\u201d\n\nI told her it must be so strange to be at the center of conversations like that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIn the beginning, it was like, when someone recognized me on the street, I was like, Someone recognized me on the street?\u201d She smiled, then shook her head. \u201cBut now \u2026 it\u2019s nice, of course, when people appreciate what you are doing. But I think it\u2019s a focus on me, as Greta\u201d\u2014and here, as she pronounced her own name, I heard for the first time her native speaking voice, the emphasis on the second syllable \u2014 \u201cnot as one among many.\u201d\n\nThis was not just a matter of fairness, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like being in the center. I don\u2019t like being heard. I don\u2019t like to be always in the spotlight. I\u2019d rather be in the back and not say anything.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut I can\u2019t really complain, because I\u2019ve put myself in this situation and so much is at stake.\u201d\n\nI wondered aloud if she would still be doing the same kind of work in five years.\n\n\u201cI think that I will be doing \u2026 something,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t be as interesting in people\u2019s eyes, of course, as I am now. That will fade away eventually. But I will still try to do everything I can from where I am.\u201d\n\n*This article appears in the September 16, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
