Now, as CNET reports, the company has sent out invites for a November 13th event that prominently displays the unmistakable silhouette of a classic RAZR V3 as part of an animated teaser image:\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to tell for sure, it certainly looks like we\u2019re seeing the RAZR\u2019s signature hinge pulled away from the edge of the handset to reveal a different sort of hinge underneath \u2014 perhaps to better house a true foldable screen like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold.\n\nMotorola appears to have multiple taglines for the event, but they all strongly hint at the foldable RAZR. The invite includes the phrase \u201cYou\u2019re going to flip,\u201d and the event will apparently be the \u201chighly-anticipated unveiling of a reinvented icon,\u201d according to CNET.\n\nWe may already know what this phone looks like, by the way, courtesy of these leaked images from Weibo.", "description": "We heard early this year that Motorola would be bringing back its iconic RAZR handset as a pricy smartphone with a vertically folding screen, and in February the company confirmed it was working on a foldable for this year.
