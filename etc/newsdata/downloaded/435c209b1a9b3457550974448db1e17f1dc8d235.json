And this thing is darn emotional if I do say so myself.\n\nAs someone who has dipped into the saga over the years with differing levels of interest, from watching the original trilogy as a kid, and then The Phantom Menace back as a pre-teen and beyond, even I know the next instalment coming is big. Huge, even.\n\nHas Star Wars ever been this emotional? Probably, definitely, yes. But with this being the last story in the Skywalker saga it adds another layer to proceedings. The ante has been well and truly upped. The door is closing and, while a couple of windows are opening in the form of spinoff trilogies, this is the saga that made us fall in love with the Star Wars universe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe battle between the light and the dark forces is taking shape and it looks mighty ominous. As the Resistance seeks to usurp the First Order once and for all, in emotional scenes that will have us screaming at the screen \u2018I\u2019m not crying, you are\u2019 for all of eternity, Daisy Ridley\u2018s Rey teams back up with John Boyega\u2018s Finn, Kelly Marie Tran\u2018s Rose and Oscar Isaac\u2018s Poe Dameron in the JJ Abrams-directed flick.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nQuickly-cut snapshots that leave us dangling and wanting more show the rebels appear to go up against \u2013 or are they joining up with? \u2013 a very wet, unmasked Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) in the ultimate battle.\n\nBut it\u2019s without a doubt the emotional scenes of Carrie Fisher\u2019s final appearance as Princess Leia \u2013 three years after her death \u2013 that get me. They get me good.\n\nWith her voice, along with Mark Hamill\u2019s Luke Skywalker, talking all about the Force (\u2018The Force will be with you. Always\u2019), one embrace with Rey and a single tear is enough to turn any stone man to a blubbering baby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as if C-3PO taking \u2018one last look\u2026at his friends\u2019 didn\u2019t have you dramatically bawling? Lies!\n\nStill, there are some stonehearted beasts who feel the whole shebang isn\u2019t emo enough for them. \u2018Disappointing\u2019 was what some pundits proferred.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, the final appearance of Carrie f**king Fisher isn\u2019t enough to have you crawling into the foetal position in floods of tears?\n\nCarrie Fisher\u2019s appearance in the trailer would have been enough to penetrate the stoniest of hearts (Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\nWhat heartless wench has this fandom turned into? I didn\u2019t realise I was dealing with a bunch of flippin Sheev Palpatines.\n\nIt seems many have found fault with not receiving any *fresh* information in the trailer. It\u2019s almost like Abrams wanted this snippet to act as a binding of the past films, a gentle reminder of what has happened with the knowledge we know what\u2019s about to come.\n\nTrailers now seem to give away the main event, with fans demanding more and more to have secrets unearthed in the trailer, yet feel robbed of a film when they\u2019re given too much.\n\nWe\u2019re never happy, are we?\n\nHow could C-3PO taking \u2018one last look\u2026at his friends\u2019 not have you bursting into tears? (Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\nThere is no way Abrams was going to give up the gun and share his valuable secrets for the final frontier, which he insisted would tie the past nine films up in a neat little package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith it being the finale, there is absolutely no doubt (in my mind, at least) this film will serve the fans well. After all, it\u2019s not written by the Game Of Thrones showrunners, so surely it\u2019s going to impress (c\u2019mon, I had to).\n\nBut there is a wistfulness to the two minutes of trailer we\u2019ve been blessed with and if you\u2019re after \u2018more\u2019, I mean this with the greatest of respect, but what the hecking heck is wrong with you?\n\nStar Wars fans deserve to have that carrot dangled a little longer to make the finale all the more worthwhile. Since when did we start treating trailers with the same artistic, plot-driven criticism we do the film? Oh, the trailer didn\u2019t give enough away? You now have to go and see the thing in the cinema? I\u2019m soooo sorry.\n\nThe saga has spanned decades but will come to an end this December, with Abrams admitting that, although \u2018endings are the thing that scare me the most\u2019, he hopes the film will provide answers for many of the lingering questions.\n\nTrust that he will, dear reader.\n\nThe trailer gives us just what we need to show how real and raw this chapter is going to be. From the lingering suggestion of \u2018Reylo\u2019 to the emotional forever farewell from Leia and Luke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no coming back from this.\n\nOn the whole the fandom was well and truly in their feels, as the great bard Drake would say, as we now spend the next two months emotionally prepping for what is bound to be splitting heartache.\n\nBecause this is the end, my only friend.\n\nAnd I, for one, am ready.\n\nJust kidding, I\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m not ready at all.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker is in cinemas 19 December.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
