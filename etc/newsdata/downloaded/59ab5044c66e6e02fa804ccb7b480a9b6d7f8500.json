She did not cry out or anything\u2019, the website claimed.\n\nRonaldo with his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez (Picture: Instagram/Golders/@georginagio)\n\nThe police investigation into Ms Mayorga\u2019s allegations lasted 11 months before Nevada prosecutors decided in July not to pursue it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmails suggest the case was dropped because detectives could not be sure the documents published by Football Leaks were not altered.\n\nIn response to the email leak, Ronaldo\u2019s legal representatives denied the rape allegations and pointed to a statement made by his US lawyer Peter Christiansen last year, when a warrant for his DNA was issued.\n\nIt said: \u2018Mr Ronaldo has maintained that what occurred in Las Vegas in 2009 was consensual in nature, so it is not surprising that DNA would be present, nor that the police would make this very standard request as part of their investigation.\u2019\n\nThey have also said that the case was based on \u2018fabricated\u2019 documents \u2014 the supposed notes between the footballer and his team which had been sold to Football Leaks.\n\nMs Mayorga is reportedly now pursuing a civil case against Ronaldo, seeking damages of \u00a3165,000.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
