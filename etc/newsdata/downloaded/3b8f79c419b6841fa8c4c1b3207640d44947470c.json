It\u2019s buried in landfills, it litters the streets in some countries, and sooner or later large amounts of it enters our rivers and oceans. It has prompted some to claim that by 2050 there could be more plastic in the oceans by weight than fish.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just bad for the environment; it\u2019s also bad for the global economy. As most plastic packaging is only used once, up to 95% of the value of the material \u2013 worth up to $120bn annually \u2013 is quite literally thrown away. In short, we\u2019ve been treating something valuable as if it\u2019s worthless. And that needs to change.\n\nBanning plastic isn\u2019t necessarily the best solution, as other types of packaging, such as glass or metal, often have a bigger carbon footprint. It\u2019s also an incredibly useful material: it keeps our food fresh, for example, and it stops products from getting damaged during transport or drying out before we\u2019ve had a chance to use them. But if a total ban isn\u2019t the answer, what is?\n\nTaking collective action\n\nAccording to the New Plastics Economy, which brings together business, government and other actors to rethink and redesign the future of plastic, we should look to reduce the amount of plastic we use, reuse it wherever possible, and ensure it is recycled properly so that it stays within the plastic value chain \u2013 a concept known as the circular economy.\n\n\u201cWe see it [plastic waste] as a systemic problem which no single organisation or part of the value chain can solve on its own,\u201d says Sander Defruyt, new plastics economy lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. \u201cWe need the producers of plastics, the brands and retailers who use and sell packaging, as well as governments and organisations that collect, sort and recycle plastics, to work together in order to solve this issue.\u201d\n\nHenkel, a global chemical and consumer goods company, has risen to this challenge. As well as being a member of the New Plastics Economy and signatory of its Global Commitment, which unites businesses, governments, and other organisations behind a common vision and targets for addressing plastic waste, it is one of the founder members of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. This is a group of global companies that have collectively committed $1bn to developing and bringing to scale solutions that will eliminate plastic waste in the environment.\n\nThe company\u2019s sustainability strategy includes specifics about packaging built around three core principles that reflect the key phases of a circular value chain: materials from sustainable sources, smart packaging design, and closing the loop. There is a dual focus on recyclability (aspects of packaging that make it easier to recycle) and recycled content.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A collector in Haiti receives payment for the plastic they have returned\n\nBuilding infrastructure\n\nIdeally, all consumers should be able to dispose of packaging in a responsible way once they\u2019ve finished using a product, but unfortunately this isn\u2019t always possible in developing nations. \u201cResearch from around the world shows that the vast majority of ocean plastic comes from regions without adequate waste management and recycling,\u201d says a spokesperson for the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. \u201cIn fact, about 80% of all plastic in the ocean originates on land, and 10 major river systems are the primary pathway by which unmanaged waste reaches the ocean.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the only way to combat single-use plastics\u2019: Birmingham\u2019s zero-waste supermarket Read more\n\nPlastic Bank is tackling the issue by providing people in poverty with the chance to earn money, goods or services (including medical insurance and school tuition) by removing plastic waste from the environment. In the countries where the social enterprise operates, traditional market prices for plastic are often too low to motivate people to collect it. By improving infrastructure and paying a membership bonus on collected plastic, Plastic Bank reveals the material\u2019s true value and incentivises its recovery, thereby creating a stable source of income for collectors and their families.\n\nIn 2017, Henkel became the first fast-moving consumer goods company to team up with Plastic Bank. Through the partnership, three new plastic collection centres have been opened in Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world. More than 35 tonnes of plastic has been collected so far, the equivalent of more than 1.2m drinking bottles. \u201cPlastic Bank is a great example of meeting the challenges we face and how we need to think about them holistically and creatively,\u201d says Uwe Bergmann, director of sustainability management at Henkel.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Plastic Bank founder David Katz\n\nClosing the loop\n\nThe plastic collected by Plastic Bank is sorted and introduced back into the value chain as \u201csocial plastic\u201d \u2013 which means Plastic Bank has verified that the collectors received an above-market price for it. To date, Henkel has included this plastic in 25,000 bottles for its laundry and cleaning products, and plans to integrate it into even more of its packaging in the future.\n\nBergmann says this allows consumers to make a positive contribution to the fight against plastic waste. David Katz, founder and CEO of Plastic Bank, agrees: \u201cWhen a company like Henkel takes material that has been collected and puts it into packaging that goes back on to the shelf, the person who then buys that bottle is helping to put an end to poverty, and they\u2019re stopping plastic from flowing into the ocean.\u201d\n\nIndeed, we all have an important role to play in keeping plastic out of the environment and in the circular economy \u2013 and that starts with recognising that it is a material we really can\u2019t afford to waste.\n\nFind out how Henkel is moving towards a circular economy with sustainable packaging", "description": "Plastic is a major environmental pollutant, but the re-use of the material could dramatically increase by providing people in poverty with the chance to earn money through recycling schemes", "authors": ["Duncan Jefferies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/373799f68bfd8382c4e69432f7b00cf0882e2e85/1831_729_2905_1743/master/2905.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cad3a5c8fb3727599cd270e883245818", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
