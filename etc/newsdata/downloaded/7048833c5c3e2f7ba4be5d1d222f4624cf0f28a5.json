REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Waymo is exploring deploying its self-driving technology in the trucking industry, CEO John Krafcik said on Thursday, as it works with industry partners to seize a commercial opportunity from a looming shortage of human drivers.\n\nWaymo, backed by Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google, has so far focused on so-called robotaxis but, in remarks prepared for a speech to the Frankfurt motor show, Krafcik said the self-driving technology, Waymo Driver, was also suited to steering road freight.\n\n\u201cRide-hailing is an important application of our Driver,\u201d Krafcik told political and industry leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at the event\u2019s official opening.\n\n\u201cOur technology can also make trucking safer and stronger, and fill a pressing need for more drivers in many parts of the world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already conducted road tests of the Waymo Driver in Class 8 trucks across the U.S., and we\u2019re working closely with the ecosystem \u2014 shippers, truck makers, and Tier One suppliers \u2014 to ensure a successful deployment.\u201d\n\nIndustry experts and analysts forecast a severe shortage of truck drivers in aging societies, including Germany, leading mobility players including Uber (UBER.N) to develop applications that aim to boost the sector\u2019s efficiency.\n\nTen-year-old Waymo is widely viewed as the leader of the self-driving race, but attaining the holy grail of full and safe automation remains challenging as companies in the field seek to recoup their research and development costs.\n\n\u201cOur journey has been a long one, but there is still a long road ahead. For sure, we\u2019ve learned a few key things over these past 10 years,\u201d said Krafcik.\n\nHe added that it was crucial to achieve scale and robustness, and also to work with partners to win acceptance for a new definition of mobility.", "description": "Waymo is exploring deploying its self-driving technology in the trucking industry, CEO John Krafcik said on Thursday, as it works with industry partners to seize a commercial opportunity from a looming shortage of human drivers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428993843&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0I1-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
