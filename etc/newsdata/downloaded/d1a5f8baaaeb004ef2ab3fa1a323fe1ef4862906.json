Just mentioning a freshman QB isn\u2019t fair to the freshman QB.\n\nAnd yet, while young Arch is four years from being eligible for college and seven or eight from the NFL \u2013 if he even progresses to either level of the game \u2013 his emergence is not a moment too soon for fans who have grown up or become accustomed to having a Manning in their football lives.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nArch is the grandson of Archie Manning, the nephew of Peyton and Eli Manning and the son of Cooper Manning, making him the third generation of what is arguably America\u2019s first family of football.\n\nAnd it is a football family that is experiencing a rare transition.\n\nQuarterbacks Peyton Manning (L) and Eli Manning have a brief second of family time after a 2013 game between the Giants and Broncos. (Getty Images)\n\nOn Tuesday the New York Giants announced rookie Daniel Jones would be their Week 3 starter, meaning mainstay and future Hall of Famer Eli Manning would be a backup.\n\nIt is just the second time since the 1998 season that a Manning isn\u2019t a starting NFL QB. That\u2019s when Peyton, the No. 1 pick overall, began his lengthy career with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here\u2019s how.]\n\nUnlike Week 13 of the 2017 season, the only other time Eli sat, this has the potential to be permanent. If Jones plays as well as the Giants hope (they drafted him sixth overall out of Duke last spring) then Eli may never see another snap.\n\nEli is a Giants legend, but Jones is the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, that\u2019s 21-plus seasons with a Manning brother running a team. Peyton racked up 292 career starts (265 of them in the regular season) from 1998-2015 with Indy and Denver. Eli had 244 starts (232 in the regular season) from 2004-until this past Sunday, all with the Giants.\n\nPrior to that there was Archie, who started 139 games (mostly for New Orleans) from 1971-1984.\n\nThe NFL is 100 years old this year and perhaps no single family has had a greater impact on the league \u2013 at least on the field.\n\nArchie was a hugely popular player in New Orleans, helping establish fan passion for the franchise despite playing on some terrible clubs.\n\nPeyton and Eli, meanwhile, combined for six Super Bowl appearances (and four titles) not to mention countless big playoff and regular-season games. Together they proved to be the most resistant foil to the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady New England super program that has dominated the league the past couple of decades.\n\nAnd yet, just like that, it might be no more Mannings.\n\nThe three of them combined for 337 regular-season victories and 22 more in the playoffs. There is a total of 162,552 yards passing, 1,084 touchdowns thrown, 81 comebacks and 103 game-winning drives. They even rushed for 46 touchdowns, playoffs included.\n\nOf course, the NFL stats tell only part of the story.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left, Peyton, Archie and Eli Manning, pictured in 2008, collectively totaled 162,552 passing yards in their NFL careers. (AP)\n\nAll three were major stars at the college level, with Archie and Eli leading Ole Miss to some of its greatest seasons, and Peyton turning Tennessee into a high-profile national program. All three are either in, or will be in, the college football Hall of Fame. Both Peyton and Eli are shoo-ins for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nArchie has spent time as a prominent college broadcaster and served on the College Football Playoff committee. Peyton and Eli have starred in an array of national television commercials (especially Peyton) and even hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nFor the past quarter of a century the family has run the Manning Passing Academy each summer in Louisiana. It hasn\u2019t just help develop high school quarterbacks but served as a place for college and future NFL stars to serve as counselors and refine their game. Nine future No. 1 picks (from Sam Darnold to Jameis Winston to Matthew Stafford) have worked the camp and it\u2019s not just quarterbacks \u2013 Odell Beckham Jr. and other receivers once ran routes there.\n\nThe Mannings have been \u2013 and will continue to be \u2013 everywhere (sorry, but you\u2019ll be stuck humming that Nationwide jingle for many years to come).\n\nAll dynasties end, of course. All careers come to a close. Maybe with the Mannings it just felt like they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThey were all remarkably durable. Archie famously took a beating with the Saints but always came back. Peyton started every game of his first 13 seasons before missing a year with a neck injury that was supposedly career threatening. He wound up returning for four seasons in Denver, where he missed just six games in his final year.\n\nEli was even more reliable, at one point starting 210 straight regular-season games.\n\nThere were all the big rivalries, the Super Bowls and the controversies (Archie forcing Eli out of San Diego to New York, Peyton receiving curious shipments to his home).\n\nAnd they always welcomed the spotlight. At Peyton\u2019s final playoff run after the 2015 season, the NFL routinely handed out locker room quote sheets of not just Archie but brother Cooper, whose own career as a wide receiver was cut short while he was at Ole Miss.\n\nNow it is Cooper\u2019s son who may one day carry on the family business. Peyton\u2019s twin boys are just 8. Eli\u2019s lone son was born this year; he joins three older sisters. No one knows if any of them want to play football, let alone if they are good enough to make a life of it.\n\nNo one knows with Arch either. Being a freshman starter is pressure enough on the kid.\n\nBut as the Mannings finally, officially, transition out of NFL on-field prominence, there is at least a spark of hope that the name will be back. Until then, all eyes on Isidore Newman.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "America's first football family is in transition after Eli Manning's demotion.
