Officials have referred to the site by several names, including the Nevada Test and Training Range, \"Watertown\" and \"Dreamland.\"\n\nAREA 51 EXPERT ON SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO 'STORM' TOP-SECRET SITE: MILITARY WON'T LET ANYONE GET CLOSE\n\nRead on for more about the history and excitement surrounding the secret military base as the \"Storm Area 51\" event, which may have as many as 2 million people attend, goes on this weekend.\n\nWhere is Area 51?\n\nArea 51 is a government facility in the Nevada desert near Groom Lake, a dry lakebed located about 120 miles north of Las Vegas. The site was chosen in the 1950s to secretly test the Air Force\u2019s U-2 aircraft and train pilots, according to the CIA.\n\nThe area had earlier been used during World War II as an aerial gunnery range for Army pilots.\n\nEmployees take small, unmarked passenger planes from the Las Vegas airport to get to the remote area, according to Business Insider.\n\nWhat is Area 51?\n\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower approved the facility\u2019s development in the 1950s, according to the CIA. The site was used by the Air Force to test the U-2 spy plane during the Cold War.\n\nTRUMP'S' OPINION ON UFOS: NOPE -- BUT YOU NEVER KNOW\n\nIn 2013, the CIA acknowledged its existence, releasing its location and how it had been used to test military aircraft, including the F-117A, A-12 and TACIT BLUE, according to Business Insider.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t exactly known what the base is currently used for, an Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews told The Washington Post that Area 51 is where \u201cwe train American armed forces\u201d and \u201cis an open training range for the U.S. Air Force.\u201d\n\n\"The U.S. Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets,\" McAndrews added.\n\nMcAndrews discouraged civilians from visiting the area.\n\nWhy is it linked to alien conspiracy theories?\n\nIt has been linked to alien conspiracy theories since the testing of a spy plane in 1955, leading to sightings of what people called \u201cunidentified flying objects.\u201d For decades, it has been thought to serve as a holding site for UFOs, aliens and government secrets about extraterrestrials.\n\nSENATORS BRIEFED ON UFOS AS SPECULATION GROWS SURROUNDING NAVAL SIGHTINGS: REPORT\n\nHowever, Air Force officials at the time couldn\u2019t reveal the top-secret U-2 tests to the public. They explained the sightings as \"natural phenomena\" and \"high-altitude weather research,\" according to Business Insider.\n\nUFO fever gripped the U.S. nearly a decade earlier after an unidentified object crashed in Roswell, N.M on July 8, 1947. Officials would label the crashed object a weather balloon.\n\nWhy the hype?\n\nThe secrets surrounding Area 51 have spurred the public's interest in learning what the facility holds.\n\nA group of over 400,000 UFO enthusiasts \u2014 which is continuing to grow \u2014 recently made a social media pledge to \"storm\" the site to \u201csee them aliens.\u201d However, Annie Jacobsen \u2013 author of \"Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base,\u201d said she doesn\u2019t think the government will let anyone near the facility.\n\n\"That base is so jealously guarded, both in terms of media and in terms of actual physicality. I don't think the Air Force or any of the other military partners or intelligence community partners that are all working out there at Area 51 are gonna let anybody anywhere near the entrance to Area 51,\" Jacobsen told \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nJacobsen, a Pulitzer Prize finalist and New York Times bestselling author, said \"disinformation\" and \"cover stories\" about the operations at Area 51 continue to this day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Chris Ciaccia contributed to this report.", "description": "The top-secret military base known as Area 51 has long been a point of discussion for conspiracy theorists who believe the facility holds government secrets about\u00a0aliens\u00a0and UFOs.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-609845268.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-15"}
