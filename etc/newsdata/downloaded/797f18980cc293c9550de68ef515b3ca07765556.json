Biles won five of the six gold medals at last week\u2019s world championships and broke the all-time record of 25 medals by any gymnast, male or female.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just above anything else that we have seen in the sport,\u201d five-time Olympic gold medalist Nadia Comaneci said of Biles on Sunday, praising \u201cthe domination that she has toward all the other gymnasts that competed here.\u201d\n\nBiles has not just got the talent. She\u2019s got the character of an Olympic star.\n\nThere\u2019s the laser-like focus on training, the same easygoing humor which endeared the world to Bolt, and \u2014 crucially in the modern era \u2014 a savvy social-media style.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said Sunday that Biles\u2018 star status would make gymnastics a must-see event at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\u201cYou can have legends confirming their status as we have just seen with Simone Biles, this amazing performance there on the beam, but you also have new stars,\u201d he said. \u201cGymnastics has all the ingredients to be top another time, I must say. A top Olympic event in Tokyo.\u201d\n\nDespite its dispute with Biles over the scoring for her new double-double beam dismount \u2014 its grade was lessened in part so as not to encourage less-skilled gymnasts to attempt the risky move \u2014 the International Gymnastics Federation knows Biles is crucial to the sport.\n\nLabeling her \u201cwonder woman\u201d and \u201ca hero,\u201d FIG president Morinari Watanabe is keen for Biles not to retire after the Tokyo Olympics. \u201cI hope she will continue after 2020, because she is an excellent athlete,\u201d he said Sunday.\n\nBiles is certainly the only athlete who could pull off her look in training at the U.S. nationals in August. She caused a stir with a leotard bearing her surname and a goat\u2019s head picked out in sequins, a nod to \u201cGreatest Of All Time.\u201d\n\nFew disagree, but Biles hasn\u2019t yet won everyone over.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to turn her into some unbeatable queen. If I was 15 years younger, I\u2019d definitely take the fight to the American,\u201d the Russian gymnast Svetlana Khorkina said in comments on the Russian Olympic Committee website Thursday.\n\nKhorkina won 20 world championship medals between 1994 and 2001 and held the women\u2019s record until Biles overtook her Tuesday.\n\nOne record is likely to remain out of Biles\u2018 reach, however. Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina won a record 15 Olympic medals between 1956 and 1964. Biles won five Olympic medals in Rio de Janeiro, and could add six more next year in Tokyo, but appears highly unlikely to stick around until the 2024 Olympics.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another record to aim for. Matching her world championship performance from last week would make Biles the first female gymnast to win five gold medals at a single Olympics, and the first female athlete to do so in any sport since East German swimmer Kristin Otto in 1988.\n\nAfter Biles pioneered a new beam dismount and triple-double on the floor this season, her coach Laurent Landi says he favors refining her existing routines for the Olympics over adding yet more upgrades.\n\n\u201cI can find plenty of (upgrades), but you need to be realistic and only the medals count at the end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to show off everything we can do.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps both retired since the last Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the U.S. gymnast will be the face of the games for much of the world.
