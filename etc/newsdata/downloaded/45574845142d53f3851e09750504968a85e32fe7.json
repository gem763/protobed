October 2003: Anna gives Natalia up for adoption. 2008: Natalia arrives in the United States and was adopted by New Hampshire couple Dyan and Gary Ciccone. April 2010: Natalia is in the care of an adoption agency in Florida who offered Kristine and Michael Barnett the opportunity to adopt her. 2010: The Barnetts take her to Manning Children's Hospital to have her bone density tested. The results estimate she is eight years old. 2012: The Barnetts take Natalia again to have her bone density tested. This test suggests she is 11 years old. 2012: A court decision declares Natalia was an adult born in 1989. 2013: The Barnetts leave for Canada and rent Natalia an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana, cutting off all communication with her. 2013- 2016: Couple Antwon and Cynthia Bishop-Mans come into Natalia's life. 2016: The Bishop-Mans file to become Natalia's legal guardians, describing her as an 'alleged incapacitated person' who was 13 or 14 years old. September 2019: The Barnetts are charged with child neglect. September 2019: DailyMail.com discovers Natalia is living with the Bishop Mans.\n\nShe added: 'I've learnt that they tried to put her in a mental facility twice, that she wanted to poison, to kill someone. That's what I read on Viber, I was sent it, and photos of her parents.'\n\nThe mother of four other kids has shared with DailyMailTV the deeply distressing story of how she felt forced to surrender her newborn daughter because of the child's severe disabilities.\n\nAnd wiping away tears, she made a heartfelt plea to Natalia herself: 'Daughter, forgive me for what happened 16 years ago. Visit soon for me to see you.\n\n'We are waiting for you. You have two sisters and two brothers.'\n\nAnna, who had divorced the baby's father before her birth, says she later learned that social services named the girl Natasha, a Ukrainian variation of Natalia.\n\nDailyMailTV reporters saw a document at the orphanage that proved the baby was admitted in October 2003. They were not permitted to copy of picture it.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Natalia was indeed a minor child and 'dependent' of the Barnetts when they rented her an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana in 2013 before leaving town and breaking off contact.\n\nThe couple, who have since divorced, admit moving to Canada without her so their oldest son Jacob, a physics prodigy with autism, could attend university there.\n\nBut they insist that, by then, Natalia was legally considered an adult after they obtained an emergency court order the previous year to revise her date of birth from September 4, 2003 to September 4, 1989, citing medical experts.\n\nToday, depending on whom you believe, Natalia is either a 30 year-old woman or a 16-year-old trapped in a legal limbo that prevents her from even attending high school.\n\nHer biological mother is insistent, however, the court made a terrible mistake and that her daughter has never lied.\n\nMichael (left) and Kristine Barnett (right) say they are the true victims, however, alleging the cute 'six-year-old' they adopted in 2010 was actually a violent grown up pretending to be a child because of a severe psychiatric illness\n\nDailymailTV reporters saw a document at the orphanage that proved the baby was admitted in October 2003. They were not permitted to copy of picture it. Pictured: The orphanage Natalia was placed where she remained for five years until officials contacted Anna to say she was about to be adopted by an American couple\n\nShe has an especially vivid memory of the distressing events of September 4, 2003 when she gave birth to Natalia at 6:25am but felt forced to surrender her immediately because of the child's severe disabilities.\n\n'I thought everything would be fine. And when I had an ultrasound done I was told that there were, so to say, no options. That the child would be disabled,' Anna told DailyMailTV.\n\n'I suffered for over a day to give birth to her. Doctors showed her to me and immediately told me that the girl shouldn't be taken [home] because she had a complex pathology.\n\nShort little legs, short little arms. She had no neck. In a nutshell they told me to leave her. And that was it. I did not see my baby girl after that.\n\n'Short little legs, short little arms. She had no neck. In a nutshell they told me to leave her.\n\n'The [doctor] said: 'I am not recommending you to take her with you. You are still young, perhaps it will be fine in the future and you will give birth to other children'.\n\n'And that was it. I did not see my baby girl after that.'\n\nAnna, who had divorced the baby's father before her birth, says she later learned that social services named the girl Natasha, a Ukrainian variation of Natalia.\n\nNatasha was placed in an orphanage where she remained for five years until officials contacted Anna to say she was about to be adopted by an American couple.\n\n'They showed a photo on a camera and asked me not to interfere with the adoption,' recalled Anna, whose other children are named Miroslav, Kira, Yulia and Deniska.\n\n'[They told me] there are good people in America, they will pay for everything, the child will be normal.\n\n'I was told that they would do her a surgery which I wouldn't be able to afford. They said the surgery was some $80,000.\n\n'Of course I am not excusing myself, I did wrong too for ditching her, leaving her 16 years ago.'\n\nWiping away tears, Anna said: 'Short little legs, short little arms. She had no neck. In a nutshell they told me to leave her. And that was it. I did not see my baby girl after that'\n\nDailyMailTV has learned independently that Natalia arrived in the US in 2008 with paperwork stating she was named Gava Natalia Vadymivna and was born September 4, 2003\n\nDailyMailTV asked Anna to review photographs of Natalia Barnett to try to rule out the possibility another female had assumed her child's identity.\n\nBut she insisted Natalia and Natasha were the same girl, adding: 'She's like me. The way I was in my childhood.'\n\n'Why did they decide that she is older than according to documents?' she demanded to know. 'It is clear that the child does not look older.\n\n'You [the Barnetts] were saying and swearing you'd help the child but it turns out you didn't do anything. Why are you leaving an underage child and say that she's older?'\n\nDailyMailTV has learned independently that Natalia arrived in the US in 2008 with paperwork stating she was named Gava Natalia Vadymivna and was born September 4, 2003.\n\nThe documents listed her mom's name as Gava Hanna Volodymyrivna and said she had been 'abandoned at hospital #1 of Mykolaiv city due to the affection of her bone muscular system', with no parents or other relatives visiting or interested in her.\n\nNatalia was initially adopted by a New Hampshire couple called Dyan and Gary Ciccone, who this week told DailyMailTV they did not want to discuss their time with her.\n\nBy spring of 2010, Natalia was in the care of an adoption agency in Florida who offered Kristine and Michael Barnett the opportunity to adopt her.\n\nParenting author Kristine, 45, and her 43-year-old ex were eager to have Natalia despite learning she had Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, an inherited bone growth disorder that means she's no taller than a toddler.\n\nBut they claim they soon harbored doubts about her age when they noticed Natalia had public hair, was having periods and possessed a vocabulary way beyond her years.\n\nNatalia was initially adopted by a New Hampshire couple called Dyan and Gary Ciccone, who this week told DailyMailTV they did not want to discuss their time with her. By spring of 2010, Natalia was in the care of an adoption agency in Florida who offered Kristine and Michael Barnett the opportunity to adopt her\n\nKristine Barnett alleged in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Natalia had attacked other kids, poured bleach in her coffee and threatened to stab family members and hide their bodies in the backyard\n\nWhen she allegedly began to suffer mental health problems, the Barnetts say they sought the advice of experts who agreed in 2012 she was likely far older than her birth certificate suggested.\n\nThat same year Kristine and Michael Barnett say they lodged an emergency petition with Marion Superior Court to have Natalia's date of birth revised so she could get the appropriate treatment she needed as an adult.\n\nBy then, Kristine Barnett alleged in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Natalia had attacked other kids, poured bleach in her coffee and threatened to stab family members and hide their bodies in the backyard.\n\n'She was standing over people in the middle of the night. You couldn't go to sleep. We had to hide all the sharp objects,' she claimed.\n\n'I saw her putting chemicals, bleach, Windex something like that, in my coffee and I asked her, what are you doing? She said, I am trying to poison you.'\n\n'The media is painting me to be a child abuser but there is no child here.'\n\nProsecutors see things very differently, however, accusing the couple of felony neglect by endangering the life or health of a dependent and denying her necessary support and an education.\n\nTheir case does not strictly hinge on Natalia's age because under Indiana State law a dependent can be someone who is mentally or physically disabled, regardless of age.\n\nHowever an affidavit of probable cause does refer to two bone density tests carried out on Natalia at the Peyton Manning Children's Hospital in 2010 and 2012.\n\nThe first estimated she was approximately eight years old while the second suggested she was 11.\n\nToday, Natalia is living an hour from Indianapolis with a Christian couple and their five kids. Her new 'dad', 36-year-old Antwon Mans, was recently ordained as a pastor and lives in a former church parsonage with his wife Cynthia, 39, an ex-McDonald's manager (pictured together)\n\nDailyMail.com can reveal the devout couple are aware of the questions swirling around the true age of their Ukrainian 'daughter' - but declined to comment when approached\n\nBishop Mans and his wife appear to have come into Natalia's life sometime between 2013 and early 2016 when they lodged an application to become her legal guardians\n\nToday, Natalia is living an hour from Indianapolis with a Christian couple and their five kids.\n\nHer new 'dad', 36-year-old Antwon Mans, was recently ordained as a pastor and lives in a former church parsonage with his wife Cynthia, 39, an ex-McDonald's manager.\n\nThe devout couple are aware of the questions swirling around Natalia's age but they treat her like a teenager, dressing her in kids' clothes and last month celebrating her 16th birthday.\n\nBishop Mans and his wife appear to have come into Natalia's life sometime between 2013 and early 2016 when they lodged an application to become her legal guardians.\n\nWhen Michael Barnett filed an objection, the Manses sought but failed to overturn the 2012 court decision that 're-aged' Natalia.\n\nAnna, meanwhile, hopes Natalia will one day make the 5,500-mile journey to Mykolaiv, a bleak shipbuilding hub that decades earlier built many of the Soviet Union's feared destroyers and submarines.\n\nThe store worker says Natalia's biological father Vadik, whom she reconciled with after Natalia's birth, died six years ago.\n\nBut there is better news: Natalia's older sister Yulia, 20, is having a baby.\n\n'Natasha will soon become an auntie, my daughter is pregnant now. She's giving birth in February,' Anna added.\n\n'I would like to tell Natasha that I really want to see her. I hope that when she turns 18 she goes to Ukraine and finds me.
