Peloton has posted a net loss every year since its founding in 2012, though its $539 million in cumulative red ink is significantly below the nearly $2 billion that WeWork lost in just the last year alone.\n\nPeloton plans to sell 40 million shares of its Class A stock to public investors, priced somewhere between $26 a share and $29 a share. The company said the underwriters of the IPO would have the right to purchase an additional 6 million Class A shares.\n\nThe IPO would value Peloton somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion, depending on where the shares price. That's a significant step up from Peloton's last valuation in the private markets in 2018, when venture investors pegged its worth at $4 billion.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the company and its bankers could kick off the roadshow on Wednesday to pitch the offering to investors.\n\nA big raise for CEO John Foley\n\nPeloton also disclosed that it had entered into a new employment agreement with founder and CEO John Foley on Monday, doubling his annual salary from $500,000 to $1 million. Foley will also be eligible for annual bonus equal to up to 100% of his $1 million salary.\n\nAfter the IPO, Foley will have 6% voting power at the company, based on his 15 million shares of Class B stock, which have 20 votes per share. Existing Peloton investors Tiger Global Management will control 19.6% of the voting power after the IPO, while True Ventures will have 11.9% voting power.\n\nPublic market investors who buy Class A shares in the IPO will be entitled to one vote per share.\n\nFounded in New York in 2012, Peloton sells $2,000 internet-connected stationary bikes, as well as pricey treadmills. Customers also pay anywhere between $19 and $40 month for access to specially produced live exercise classes. The company describes itself as both a media company and a global technology platform.\n\nPeloton boasts that its \"churn rate,\" the portion of subscribers who cancel service, is extremely low. But according to customer-retention experts that Business Insider has spoken to,Peloton's reported churn metrics are significantly understated.\n\nPeloton, which lost roughly $246 million in fiscal 2019 despite fast growing revenue, plans to trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the \"PTON\" ticker.", "description": "The buzzy fitness startup announced its IPO price range in an S-1 filing with the SEC.", "authors": ["Alexei Oreskovic"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d67ae3a2e22af08b26d6632-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
