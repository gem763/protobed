A nice matchup against a poor Bengals defense sets Allen up nicely as a quality streaming option as well as to see if he can establish himself as a weekly fantasy contributor.\n\nRB: James Conner, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nOpponent: at 49ers\n\n\n\nDespite getting banged up in the Week 2 loss to Seattle, James Conner will look to lead the Steelers, sans Ben Roethlisberger to their first victory of the 2019 season as they try to upset the surprisingly 2-0 49ers this Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nWR: Larry Fitzgerald, Arizona Cardinals\n\nOpponent: vs. Panthers\n\n\n\nLarry Fitzgerald has blossomed in Kliff Kingsbury's offense through two games. For the first time in his 16-year career, he's posted back-to-back 100 yard games from the get-go. A good matchup tips the scale in favor of another big showing in Week 3 against the Panthers\n\nTE: Jason Witten, Dallas Cowboys\n\nOpponent: vs. Dolphins\n\n\n\nAfter bolting from the Monday Night Football booth after just one season, most questioned the move for Jason Witten to return to the Cowboys. Through two weeks of the season, he has thrived. No longer the main cog in Jason Garrett's offense, the veteran tight end has gelled in his new role as evident by the two receiving touchdowns he's accrued. A matchup against the putrid Dolphins should set Witten up for his third-straight week of fantasy relevance.\n\nSit 'Em\n\nQB: Matthew Stafford, Detroit Lions\n\nOpponent: at Eagles\n\n\n\nMatt Stafford has put up respectable numbers through two games against the Cardinals and Chargers, but a tough matchup against Carson Wentz and the Eagles doesn't provide enough upside to warrant a streaming consideration.\n\nRB: Joe Mixon, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nOpponent: at Bills\n\n\n\nDespite being taken off the Bengals injury report, it is clear that Joe Mixon is not at 100%. Through two games he has 27 rushing yards on 17 carries. Until further notice, he needs to be on your bench. If he turns a corner against the Bills and puts in supreme effort, you'll be set for the future, but for Week 3, he's not worth the risk.\n\nWR: Allen Robinson, Chicago Bears\n\nOpponent: at Redskins\n\n\n\nAllen Robinson has yet to make his mark since joining the Bears. Despite a relative resurgence in the season opener, the former Penn State star was a non-factor against the Broncos and will be facing Redskins cornerback Josh Norman on Monday Night Football, who has something to prove after a subpar performance in the team's home opening loss to Dallas.\n\nTE: O.J. Howard, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nOpponent: vs. Giants\n\n\n\nO.J. Howard was primed for his breakout campaign but through two games has seen his role diminish in Bruce Arians' offense. While any improvement against the Giants will be a welcome sign, you cannot afford to have him in your lineup in Week 3.\n\nQuarterback Rankings: Week 3\n\nRunning Back Rankings: Week 3\n\nWide Receiver Rankings: Week 3\n\nTight End Rankings: Week 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantasy Football: Start Em Sit Em Week 3 originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington", "description": "Fantasy Football season is finally here and it's time to set your lineup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BJW67i2D1z2mTUN618ctgg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/408UejiTOQiuwlvq8mxbNg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnwashington.com/eaf65f22ad7b13e805dd6d990ca690e4", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
