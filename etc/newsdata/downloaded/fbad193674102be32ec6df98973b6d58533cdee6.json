Some of the pictures \u2014 obtained ahead of publication by HuffPost \u2015 feature Banksy himself, albeit partially obscured so as not to reveal his identity.\n\nSteve Lazarides \u201cBanksy Captured\u201d contains previously unseen images that Steve Lazarides snapped of Banksy during their 11 years working together, such as this one.\n\nLazarides and Banksy (who both hail from Bristol in southwestern England) first met in 1997, when Lazarides was picture editor and in-house photographer for the now-defunct Sleazenation magazine.\n\n\u201cWe were doing an article, Banksy\u2019s name came up. No one had fucking heard of him at that point, so I went through some of the contacts I knew [from growing up in Bristol] and I photographed him down on the dockside,\u201d Lazarides recalled. \u201cI remember it to this day. I drove a shitty Ford Escort at the time. We went out and got shit-faced. I came back the next day\u201d and someone \u201chad nicked\u201d the Ford.\n\n\u201cIt spiraled from there really,\u201d Lazarides continued. \u201cI started out as his photographer, then began selling some of his works, ended up selling more than his agent at the time. I became his agent, dealer, driver. We then did the gallery. But it wasn\u2019t your standard gallerist relationship. It was much deeper than that. It was much stronger. It was a fucking riot.\u201d\n\nSteve Lazarides The true identity of Banksy, pictured here, has sparked plenty of speculation over the years -- but has never been officially confirmed.\n\nLazarides, who studied photography in college, documented Banksy\u2019s numerous stunts, shows, studios and projects. He wanted his photos to have their own merit.\n\n\u201cI was shooting it like I was shooting a photograph, not like I was shooting a piece of Banksy\u2019s artwork, if that makes sense,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 12,000 film negatives of his time with the artist \u201csat in files for years because I had no contact sheets,\u201d Lazarides said. Then, he finally decided to start scanning them into a computer. The painstaking process took more than two years.\n\n\u201cIt was a very strange period of time,\u201d said Lazarides. \u201cFilm cameras were on their way out. It was incredibly expensive. But digital cameras hadn\u2019t really come in. The internet wasn\u2019t really that up and running. There was no social media, so you\u2019re in a period in time when I suddenly realized, \u2019Oh fuck, I\u2019m the only person in the world with these pictures.\u2019\u201d\n\nSteve Lazarides Steve Lazarides and Banksy, pictured here, went their separate ways in 2008 after more than a decade working together.\n\nSome photos, he couldn\u2019t even remember taking. He lost \u201ca ton of work that just never turned up again that was digital.\u201d The 252-page book will contain around 500 of these pictures, including a small number that appeared in Banksy\u2019s seminal \u201cWall and Piece\u201d book, first published in 2005.\n\n\u201cHindsight is a wonderful thing,\u201d said Lazarides. \u201cTo me, at the time, they didn\u2019t mean fuck all, when you\u2019re stuck in the eye of the hurricane. I was unconfident as a photographer and it\u2019s taken years to look back on some of them and think, \u2018Oh, actually, I wasn\u2019t that shit.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the way people view Banksy\u2019s paintings,\u201d he added. \u201cNow they\u2019re worth 9.8 million, people are looking at them in a different way. But I\u2019m still looking at it thinking, \u2018Fuck me, I had that in the boot of my car.\u2019\u201d\n\nSteve Lazarides Banksy, pictured by Lazarides, putting up his \"Pissing Guard\" piece.\n\nLazarides has a particular fondness for one sequence of images he took of Banksy in 2004, when the artist infiltrated London\u2019s Natural History Museum to hang an installation of a dead rat holding a spray can. The slogan read \u201cOur Time Will Come.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one where he\u2019s on his telephone while he\u2019s doing the piece,\u201d said Lazarides, who shared the pictures on Instagram earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s a pretty ballsy move, you haven\u2019t finished the piece yet, it\u2019s full of people and yeah, I\u2019ll take the phone call.\u2019\u201d\n\nLazarides and Banksy went their separate ways in 2008.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no great animosity there,\u201d Lazarides said. \u201cWe both moved onto different things really. I had a point to prove in one place, he was proving a point somewhere else. Our paths diverged for a bit.\u201d\n\nBanksy, he said, knows of his plan to publish the book.\n\nLars Fassinger The first time that Steve Lazarides, pictured here, met Banksy ended with his car being stolen.\n\nLazarides, meanwhile, opened and ran galleries, and hosted shows for other prominent artists. Then, in September, he announced he was quitting the gallery world for good.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t be bothered with it. It\u2019s boring, uninspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been involved in anything so boring in my life. It\u2019s not creative. It\u2019s just about money, and it doesn\u2019t engender creativity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s dead. I don\u2019t see how it can sustain itself apart from the big galleries,\u201d he added. \u201cI think they\u2019re losing their clientele. A lot of their big billionaire clients used to come to our events because they were interesting. If you\u2019re trying to tempt them with a warm glass of Chardonnay and some fucking paintings on a wall, why are they going to come? They can go anywhere they want, they can buy whatever they want. They want an experience more than anything.\u201d\n\nLazarides said he was unsure about his future. He sees his self-published book (to cut out \u201cthe big players\u201d like Amazon) and its companion website selling prints as a \u201cside project\u201d while he tries to figure out \u201cwhat I\u2019m doing.\u201d His ideas include \u201cbig mega-shows combining music, art, food and performance all under one banner,\u201d or possible further photo books of his times with other high-profile street artists, such as JR and Shepard Fairey (of \u201cHOPE\u201d Barack Obama poster fame).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. To be honest, I haven\u2019t really decided what I\u2019m going to get up to yet, which is a dangerous place for me and an even worse for the rest of you lot,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m scared.\u201d\n\nOne thing he insisted he definitely won\u2019t be doing, however, is giving up Banksy \u2014 whose identity has been the source of constant speculation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve kept the secret for 20-plus years,\u201d Lazarides said. \u201cWhy on earth am I going to give that up now. I\u2019m a stand-up man, everyone knows what that means. They\u2019ll know that I\u2019m never giving it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBanksy Captured\u201d is slated for December publication.
