However, when he was told that the meal was actually for a friend's family as their son was in the ICU, he immediately asked how he could help.\n\nAbby Fink told Phoenix news station KNXV-TV said that she had accidentally texted the wrong number and her messages were going to a man named Bill, rather than her friend, Shaun Jakeman.\n\n\"Hey brother Jakeman, this is sister Fink, we are bringing you dinner tomorrow I was wondering what time would be a good time to bring it over,\" the text read.\n\nAccording to Fink, Bill jokingly replied, \"Oooh! What're you bringing me? I'm allergic to seafood.\"\n\nFink then explained to Bill that the text was meant for Shaun Jakeman and his wife, Alex, who have a four-year-old son, Noah, who was in the ICU.\n\nBill then responded to Fink, asking, \u201cHow can I help?\u201d\n\n\"I was like, 'Well, just pray for Noah,' and he was like, 'Well I don't really pray, but I can help with donations, food, etc.,'\" Fink told KNXV-TV of Bill\u2019s text message.\n\nNoah Jakeman, four, at the ICU at Phoenix Children's Hospital.

Alex was driving Noah, along with his four siblings, to a doctor for a follow-up appointment regarding his broken ankle when he suffered a seizure and vomited, sending the fluid into his lungs.\n\n\u201c[He was] immediately intubated [at Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital], and was in full respiratory failure and has been in the ICU ever since. He had aspiration pneumonia and a bacterial infection in his blood and then has had complications and setbacks along the way,\u201d Jakeman said.\n\nFink said Bill told her he is a single father and helping a family in need would be a teachable moment for his son, adding that it is \"just what people do,\u201d KNXV-TV reported.\n\n\"I'm thinking to myself, \u2018No that's not what people do because it's hard to find good people, good genuine people who want to serve and help others,\u2019\" said Fink.\n\nBill took to Facebook on Sunday to share the exchange he had with Fink and encouraged his friends to help out the Jakeman family. He also set up a fundraiser on Facebook and got in contact with Armer Foundation for Kids, who can further assist the family.\n\nA friend of the Jakeman family has also set up a GoFundMe fundraiser to help pay future medical bills.\n\n\u201cI was blown away. He doesn\u2019t know us or Abby at all and the fact he not only offered to help but actually backed that offer with action is amazing,\u201d Jakeman told Yahoo.\n\n\"I told Bill, 'I don't know if you believe in God or not, but I believe you were sent here to help this family.' I told him he was an angel,\" Fink said to KNXV-TV.\n\nNoah Jakeman is recovering in the ICU of Phoenix Children's Hospital.

She said that she is making plans with Bill so he can meet Noah.\n\nYahoo Lifestyle was not immediately able to locate Fink for comment. a\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "After a stranger received a wrong text message and learned its intended recipient was a father whose son was in the ICU, he immediately asked what he could do to help.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a072fSsPnuxJW68zYLhYSQ--~B/aD05NjA7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/6f84ea90-d66a-11e9-b737-ba91a856f5a5"}
