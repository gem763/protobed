Darch, said Dean shined his flashlight into the bedroom and she could see Jefferson\u2019s face when he shot her.\n\nKraus said there was \u201cabsolutely no excuse\u201d for Jefferson\u2019s death, which he said had \u201ceroded the trust we have built with the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes sense she would have a gun if she felt threatened or if there was someone in the backyard,\u201d Kraus said, ending a press conference after eight minutes as he grew emotional talking about the impact the killing has had on police morale.\n\nFort Worth has called on independent experts to evaluate the police department after the shooting.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Fort Worth Police Department officer Aaron York Dean is seen in a booking photo at the Tarrant County Jail in Fort Worth, Texas, U.S. October 14, 2019.
