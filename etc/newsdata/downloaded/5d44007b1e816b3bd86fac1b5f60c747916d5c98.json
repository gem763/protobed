John Minor Botts, left, circa 1860, and President John Tyler circa 1855. (Library of Congress)\n\nOn July 22, 1842, Virginia Rep. John Minor Botts rose from his seat in the House of Representatives to introduce the first proposal in U.S. history to impeach a president. The president was fellow Whig John Tyler. Botts vowed to \u201chead him or die.\u201d\n\nWhig Party leader Henry Clay of Kentucky cautioned that impeachment might be a risky way to counter the president\u2019s bitter clashes with the Whig-controlled Congress.\n\n\u201cThere is cause enough, God knows,\u201d Clay said, \u201cbut it is a novel proceeding, full of important consequences, present and future, and should not be commenced but upon full consideration.\u201d\n\nSome of the rhetoric aimed at Tyler echoes what House Democrats are leveling at President Trump. On Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff said allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son may make impeachment inevitable. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also sent a letter to Republicans and Democrats that demanded more information from the director of national intelligence about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, but did not use the I-word.\n\n[House Democrats decry their oversight of Trump, push Pelosi on impeachment]\n\nWhen John Tyler faced impeachment 177 years ago, it was the Whigs who decided to create an investigative committee headed by a respected elder statesman, former president John Quincy Adams, who had become a Massachusetts congressman.\n\nJohn Tyler was the first vice president to succeed to the presidency in April 1841 when William Henry \u201cOld Tippecanoe\u201d Harrison died after just one month in office.\n\nThe 51-year-old Tyler, a former Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia, had only recently switched to the Whig Party. As president, he began vetoing so many bills passed by Congress that the Whigs kicked him out of their party. Mobs of angry Whigs protested in front of the White House.\n\nThe anger boiled over on the House floor, where Rep. Edward Stanly of North Carolina got into a fistfight with Tyler\u2019s best friend, Rep. Henry Wise of Virginia. Stanly complained of Tyler: \u201cHe lies like a dog.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Capitol in 1846, a few years after members of Congress attempted to impeach President John Tyler. (John Plumbe/Library of Congress)\n\nThe president was aware of the discontent in Congress. He wrote a friend, \u201cI am told that one of the madcaps talks of impeachment.\u201d That \u201cmadcap\u201d was Botts, who on July 11 gave notice of his plans, warning, \u201cIf the power of impeachment is not exercised by the House in less than six months, ten thousand bayonets will gleam on Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d\n\nEleven days later, Botts formally introduced a petition to impeach Tyler \u201con the grounds of his ignorance of the interest and true policy of this government, and want of qualification for the discharge of the important duties of President of the United States.\u201d The House voted to table the proposal for the time being.\n\nBotts separately specified his charges against Tyler. Among them: \u201cI charge him with the high crime and misdemeanor of endeavoring to excite a disorganizing and revolutionary spirit in the country, by inviting a disregard of, and disobedience to a law of Congress.\u201d He charged the president with \u201cabuse of the veto power, to gratify his personal and political resentment,\u201d and of being \u201cutterly unworthy and unfit to have the destinies of this nation in his hands as chief magistrate.\u201d\n\nThe same Democratic newspapers that had pilloried the Whig presidential ticket of \u201cTippecanoe and Tyler Too\u201d defended Tyler and attacked Botts. \u201cThe bastard son of Virginia has performed his foolish threat and produced articles of impeachment against the President of the United States,\u201d wrote the Madisonian.\n\nClay, who had resigned from the Senate to prepare to run for president in 1844, feared a voter backlash to a premature impeachment action. \u201cLet [Tyler] serve out his time and go back to Virginia from whence the Whigs have bitter cause to lament that they ever sent him forth,\u201d he said.\n\nBotts rejected such concerns.\n\n\u201cThere may be some honest but timid men\u201d who fear impeachment efforts would create sympathy for the president, he said. \u201cBut to my mind it would be quite as reasonable to suffer a mad dog to escape that runs through the public streets biting every living thing he met with, from an apprehension that it might excite a sympathy for him by the cry of kill him.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident John Quincy Adams, circa 1840s. (Mathew Brady/National Archives and Records Administration)\n\nThe Whigs were especially frustrated because Congress had failed to override any of Tyler\u2019s vetoes. The clash hit a breaking point on Aug. 9 when Tyler vetoed a major tariff bill. Adams took to the House floor to declare that the president had put the legislative and executive branches \u201cin a state of civil war.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 11, the House authorized a 13-member Select Committee on the Veto headed by Adams to investigate the president\u2019s actions. Adams despised Tyler because he was a slaveholder.\n\n[As plantations talk more honestly about slavery, some visitors are pushing back]\n\nThe committee reported back just a week later. The majority report accused Tyler of \u201cgross abuse of constitutional power and bold assumptions of powers never vested in him by any law\u201d and of having assumed \u201cthe whole legislative power to himself.\u201d The report said Tyler had \u201cstrangled\u201d the life out of Congress and committed \u201coffenses of the gravest character.\u201d The majority also charged Tyler with obstruction of justice by withholding information needed to investigate the \u201cmisdeeds by government.\u201d\n\nThe majority concluded \u201cthe case has occurred\u201d that was \u201ccontemplated by the founders of the Constitution by the grant of the power to impeach the President of the United States.\u201d However, the report didn\u2019t recommend proceeding with impeachment because \u201cof the present state of public affairs.\u201d\n\nWith the nation sharply divided, the report said, such action would \u201cprove abortive.\u201d The House approved the majority report. Tyler responded that he had \u201cbeen accused without evidence and condemned without a hearing.\u201d In a letter to a friend, the president said he apparently had committed the high crime of \u201csustaining the Constitution of the country and daring to have an opinion of my own.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 10, 1843, the House voted on Botts\u2019s articles of impeachment. But the Whigs had lost control of the body in the 1842 election, and the resolution failed. Tyler eventually issued a total of 10 vetoes (far below Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s record 635 vetoes).\n\nThe Whigs finally got some revenge in Tyler\u2019s final month in office, March 1845, when Congress overrode a veto of a bill on building Marine service ships. Thus, Tyler became the first U.S. president to have a veto overridden.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\n\u2018Kill the beast\u2019: The impeachment trial that nearly took down a president\n\nThe thin-skinned president who made it illegal to criticize his office\n\n\u2018His Accidency\u2019: The first president to die in office and the constitutional confusion that followed\n\nThe police officer who arrested a president", "description": "President Trump is under fire from the Democrats, but John Tyler was attacked by the Whigs, who threw him out of their party and moved to remove him from the White House 177 years ago", "authors": ["Ronald G.
