Yato was unavailable for Wednesday\u2019s surprise defeat by Uruguay.\n\nWallabies can expect aerial assault after Wales show hand at Rugby World Cup | Bret Harris Read more\n\nThe television match official, Rowan Kitt, advised the referee, Ben O\u2019Keeffe, that the collision was within the laws. Kitt did not have access to a camera angle that suggested Hodge should have been sent off under World Rugby\u2019s player welfare policy but the citing commissioner, at Fiji\u2019s prompting, did and ordered the Australian to appear before a three-man disciplinary committee.\n\nWorld Rugby had on Tuesday admitted the standard of officiating in the opening round had fallen below expectation but had been attended to. A few hours later, two Samoa players were not shown red cards for two dangerous challenges, one on the prompting of the TMO, Graham Hughes, who overruled the referee, Romain Poite, saying there was a mitigating circumstance. Rey Lee-Lo and Motu Matu\u2019u both escaped with a yellow card having gone high on the Russia captain, Vasily Artemyev, but were cited on Wednesday and also face missing the rest of the group stage.\n\nThe failure to sanction Hodge on the field prompted Ross Tucker, a sports scientist who this year helped World Rugby formulate its policy on high and dangerous tackles, to quickly tweet it was a straight red-card offence.\n\nThe disciplinary panel, which included the former Scotland coach Frank Hadden, looked at all the broadcast angles of the Hodge incident and ruled it was an act of foul play, reckless rather than deliberate, and that as the tackle made contact with Yato\u2019s head there was a high degree of danger.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThe tournament organisers said in a statement \u201cthe act of foul play warranted a red card\u201d. Hodge was given a six-week ban which was halved because of mitigating factors such as his previous disciplinary record and good conduct at the hearing.\n\nAustralia have 48 hours in which to appeal after receiving the written decision and on Wednesday night reserved their position. Their head coach, Michael Cheika, will have been surprised by the guilty verdict having said before the hearing: \u201cI am not planning for failure. I aim to succeed there. At last week\u2019s meeting with the officials, they talked a lot about empathy as opposed to coming over with a big stick.\u201d The danger of an appeal is that the ban could be increased.\n\nRugby Australia has two referees at the World Cup, Angus Gardner, who was criticised by both France and Argentina after Saturday\u2019s match between the sides, and Nic Berry. It is paying for two coaches to fly to Japan to help Gardner and Berry prepare for matches, saying more needed to be done to assist officials as the pressure mounts.", "description": "Reece Hodge will miss Australia\u2019s three remaining group matches \u2013 starting with Wales in Tokyo on Sunday \u2013 after the wing was banned for a high tackle against Fiji", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f0ea39ee6d1de05c2c2e2a4ac6b0c518e95fe46/247_0_2753_1651/master/2753.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=88590b37283023b721449b93ec9c966c", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
