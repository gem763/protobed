Her character first appears in the original comics.\n\n\u201cI know no one\u2019s going to believe this is true, but it\u2019s true,\u201d Maddow announced on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m \u2018Vesper Fairchild\u2019 in the new Batwoman TV show that starts this Sunday night on The CW. (My character is soooo not me; turns out playing her is one of the most fun things I\u2019ve ever done).\u201d\n\nI know no one's going to believe this is true, but it's true. I'm \"Vesper Fairchild\" in the new Batwoman TV show that starts this Sunday night on The CW. (My character is soooo not me; turns out playing her is one of the most fun things I've ever done).https://t.co/LP8PauXvUL \u2014 Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) October 4, 2019\n\nHowever, the Reporter notes that there is a catch to Maddow\u2019s role, that being that \u201cFairchild will never appear onscreen,\u201d although Maddow will still \u201cappear\u201d in multiple episodes.\n\n\u201cWe consider Vesper Fairchild to be the sardonic Voice of Gotham,\u201d Batwoman showrunner Caroline Dries told the entertainment outlet. \u201cIn addition to Rachel\u2019s interest in Batwoman, we thought she\u2019d be the perfect casting choice because her own hard-hitting journalism wildly contrasts Vesper\u2019s penchant for snark, gossip, and criticism of female superheroes.\u201d\n\nThe series, which debuts this Sunday, will see Orange is the New Black star Ruby Rose take on the role of Kate Kane, the lesbian heiress who, inspired by Batman\u2019s vigilantism, decides to user her wealth and resources to fight crime in the fictional city of Gotham.\n\nAs noted by The CW:\n\nArmed with a passion for social justice and a flair for speaking her mind, Kate Kane (star Ruby Rose) soars onto the streets of Gotham as Batwoman, an out lesbian and highly trained street fighter primed to snuff out the failing city\u2019s criminal resurgence. But don\u2019t call her a hero yet. In a city desperate for a savior, Kate must overcome her own demons before embracing the call to be Gotham\u2019s symbol of hope.\n\nIt is not the first time that Maddow has been involved in a Batman-related project. In 2010, she wrote the introduction for the deluxe hardcover edition of writer Greg Rucka\u2019s Batwoman graphic novel Elegy.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "MSNBC host and left-wing political commentator Rachel Maddow has been cast as a newscaster for the upcoming The CW series\u00a0Batwoman.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/Maddow.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
