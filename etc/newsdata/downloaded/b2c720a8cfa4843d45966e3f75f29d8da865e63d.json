While Friday\u2019s decisions stem from cases unrelated to the Ukraine matter, they each address what plaintiffs claimed was a president overstepping his constitutional bounds.\n\nPresident Trump at a campaign rally on Thursday in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) More\n\nBusiness records\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld a lower court decision, ruling that Congress can see eight years of Trump\u2019s business records held by his accounting firm, Mazars USA. The House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed the records after the president\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen testified that Trump had exaggerated his wealth when applying for loans, which is a crime.\n\n\u201cContrary to the President\u2019s arguments, the Committee possesses authority under both House Rules and the Constitution to issue the subpoena, and Mazars must comply,\u201d Judges David S. Tatel and Patricia A. Millett wrote. The judges went on to call the congressional subpoena for Trump\u2019s records \u201ca valid exercise of the legislative authority.\u201d\n\nTrump will likely appeal again, either to the full D.C. Circuit Court or to the Supreme Court.\n\nDenying green cards and visas to low-income immigrants\n\nU.S. District Court Judge George Daniels of the Southern District of New York issued a preliminary nationwide injunction blocking a Trump administration rule set to take effect next week that would have made it easier to deny green cards and visas to immigrants who cannot show they will not require public assistance. After the administration announced the new rule, nearly a dozen states filed suit to block it.\n\n\u201cThe Rule is simply a new agency policy of exclusion in search of a justification,\u201d Daniels wrote in his scathing opinion. \u201cIt is repugnant to the American dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upwards mobility.\u201d\n\nLater on Friday afternoon, Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton issued a preliminary injunction in a case announced by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.\n\nThe president\u2019s legal team is expected to appeal the decisions.\n\nWall funding\n\nU.S. District Court Judge David Briones, in the Western District of Texas, ruled that the declaration of a national emergency under which Trump diverted funds from other agencies to construct a Mexico border wall was unlawful.\n\nThe decision found that the law \u201cexpressly forbids\u201d a president from using money allocated by Congress for any other purpose than was originally set forth. The county of El Paso and the Border Network for Human Rights brought the lawsuit, contending that Trump had broken the law by diverting Defense Department funds to build the wall.\n\nThe judge did not specify what should now happen, but has asked the county and the Border Network to file a proposed preliminary injunction within 10 days. In the meantime, construction of the border wall can continue, but that could come to a halt once the terms of the injunction are specified.\n\nAn appeal is expected from the Trump administration.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The president's legal team was handed three courtroom defeats on Friday.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z1p4mvtRwzG92pEB75Pozw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/65f4e520-ec5e-11e9-b3b3-f0ceb9e90abf", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
