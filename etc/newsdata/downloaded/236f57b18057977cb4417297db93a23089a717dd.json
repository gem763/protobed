It warned epidemic-prone diseases such as Ebola, influenza and Sars are increasingly difficult to manage in the face of increasing conflict, fragile states and rising migration. The climate crisis, urbanisation and a lack of adequate sanitation and water are breeding grounds for fast-spreading, catastrophic outbreaks.\n\n\u201cFor too long, world leaders\u2019 approaches to health emergencies have been characterised by a cycle of panic and neglect,\u201d said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, former prime minister of Norway and co-chair of the board alongside World Health Organization director Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\n\n\u201cIt is high time for urgent and sustained action. This must include increased funding at the community, national and international levels to prevent the spread of outbreaks. It also requires leaders to take proactive steps to strengthen preparedness coordination mechanisms across governments and society to respond quickly to an emergency.\u201d\n\nThe report acknowledges governments and international institutions have taken steps to increase preparedness for outbreaks in the five years since the Ebola crisis in west Africa, but concludes current preparedness is \u201cgrossly insufficient\u201d. A growing lack of public trust in institutions in some countries, exacerbated by misinformation, hinders disease control, said the study.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors contrast the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a lack of trust between communities and authorities has undermined response efforts, with Uganda, where public health authorities and community officials had a preparedness plan in place when it crossed the border. Cases in Uganda were quickly isolated and detected, reducing further infections.\n\n\u201cThe trust between communities and the institutions that serve them is at the core of an emergency response, but it is almost impossible to build trust in the middle of a crisis,\u201d said As Sy.\n\n\u201cCommunity engagement and trust cannot be an afterthought, it has to be earned. Leaders and public health authorities must work as partners with communities to build that trust. We can\u2019t just show up once a health crisis hits. We need to be there before, during and after.\u201d\n\nOutbreaks could emerge naturally, but there is also a risk of accidental or deliberate release by rogue actors, which could complicate an effective response, they said.\n\nThe looming epidemic threat | Jonathan Quick Read more\n\n\u201cEbola, cholera, measles \u2013 the most severe disease outbreaks usually occur in the places with the weakest health systems,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cAs leaders of nations, communities and international agencies, we must take responsibility for emergency preparedness, and heed the lessons these outbreaks are teaching us. We have to \u2018fix the roof before the rain comes.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe report noted some recent progress. As of July 2019, 59 countries had developed a national action plan for health security. But not one is fully financed.\n\nThe report outlined seven steps to ensure the world\u2019s health system is better prepared for the next health emergency, calling on heads of states to increase funding and for international organisations to build preparedness into funding mechanisms.\n\n\u201cPoverty and fragility exacerbate outbreaks of infectious disease and help create the conditions for pandemics to take hold\u201d, said Axel van Trotsenburg, acting CEO of the World Bank. \u201cInvesting in stronger institutions and health systems will promote resilience, economic stability and global health security.\u201d", "description": "Dire risk is compounded by climate crisis, urbanisation and lack of sanitation, says global monitoring board", "authors": ["Karen Mcveigh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b5e894b9e36b1f9c5b78674860fbcaf576b5fa/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9692ada40ccc08940fc3057f21737e0f", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
