But despite there being more Tezuka content out there than any one fan could reasonably be expected to ever read, Japanese tech firm Kioxia says it\u2019s currently helping to create \u201ca new Osamu Tezuka manga.\u201d\n\n\u25bc Kioxia\u2019s project announcement video\n\nConsidering that Tezuka was born in 1928, you might be thinking that this is an ambitious undertaking for an artist of his age. What makes the news of a new Tezuka manga even more surprising, though, is that he\u2019s been dead since 1989.\n\nSo how does Kioxia hope to produce a new Tezuka manga? The key lies in the company\u2019s name, which comes from the Japanese word kioku, or \u201cmemory.\u201d Until recently, Kioxia was called Toshiba Memory, and the organization specializes in high-speed, high-capacity data storage. By digitizing Tezuka\u2019s works and analyzing them, Kioxia hopes to determine the key elements of his artistic style, then apply that knowledge to AI technology which will draw an answer to the question \u201cIf Osamu Tezuka were alive today, what kind of manga would he draw?\u201d\n\nThe concept sounds similar to what we\u2019ve seen with inputting a vast number of anime-style illustrations into generative adversarial networks and having them create new characters once they\u2019ve identified baseline aesthetics and viable variations. However, unlike previous projects which used artwork from a large number of artists, all of Kioxia\u2019s inputs will come from Tezuka alone. It\u2019s something that\u2019s only possible with an artist with such a huge body of work as Tezuka has, and the results, ideally, should be less of an amelioration of current trends across the anime/manga world, but a statistically valid illustration that Tezuka might have drawn, were he still alive.\n\nKioxia is remaining quiet on specifics, and hasn\u2019t revealed whether the project\u2019s goal is simply a collection of unrelated artwork, or a series of connected pictures that seek to tell a story. The company also hasn\u2019t mentioned if there will be any dialogue (in addition to handling art, Tezuka also was the writer for his comics), or if the AI inputs will include Tezuka\u2019s erotic mouse lady pictures, so we\u2019ll have to wait until Kioxia\u2019s \u201cnew Tezuka manga\u201d is finished and shown to the public, which is scheduled to happen in February.\n\nSources: Oricon News, Yahoo!
