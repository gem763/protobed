News of her expected support churned up positive headlines for the campaign at a time when it needed some good press.\n\n\u201cHaving someone like AOC promoting someone like Bernie Sanders might energize a lot of younger people to vote,\u201d said Raffi Mercuri, the chairman of the local Democratic Party in Boulder County, Colo.\n\n\u201cA lot of people see her as the exemplar for what the Democratic Party should stand for,\" he added. \"A lot of people see her as someone who is untainted by a long stint in Washington, who\u2019s got by just by speaking her truth; someone who\u2019s just a woman of the people.\u201d\n\nMercuri added that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s influence among Democrats, particularly younger ones, was on display last month when she spoke at the party\u2019s annual Truman Dinner.\n\nThe event, held at the University of Colorado Boulder, sold out almost immediately after tickets went on sale, Mercuri said. Organizers eventually opened up an overflow room for those who were unable to get in to the dinner itself.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll released in July showed that Ocasio-Cortez is viewed most favorably by voters who described themselves as liberal, a voting bloc with whom Sanders also performs well.\n\n\n\nMercuri added that he was not surprised by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s decision to back Sanders over Warren, noting that the freshman congresswoman was an organizer for Sanders during his 2016 presidential bid.\n\n\n\n\u201cObviously, this was probably a decision between Warren and Bernie and she came out for Bernie,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know she was a Bernie organizer in 2016 and she\u2019s been on that persuasion for a long time. It\u2019s not really surprising.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s allies are also encouraged by his performance at the three-hour Democratic primary debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday night, viewing it as a high-stakes return to form, even if Warren was the central figure on stage.\n\n\n\nAmong Sanders\u2019s allies, there is cautious optimism. Besides Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders will also be backed by Reps.

Sanders raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of the year, more than any other candidate in the race, and reported having $33.7 million on hand at the end of the quarter.\n\n\n\nBy comparison, Warren had $25.7 million in the bank, while South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegSanders seeks spark from Ocasio-Cortez at Queens rally Biden seeks to fundraise off fact he's running out of money Biden struggles to reverse fall MORE reported $23 million, Sen.

And he conceded earlier this month that he would slow down his pace on the campaign trail in the wake of his heart attack, a stunning concession at a time when candidates typically ramp up their travel and event schedules.Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement could also become a liability in a general election, when he would have to court a broader pool of voters.Among self-described moderates, the CBS News/YouGov poll found only 16 percent said they had a favorable opinion of Ocasio-Cortez, while 28 percent said they viewed her unfavorably and 25 percent said they were neutral.Republicans, including, have sought to tie the Democratic Party in its entirety to Ocasio-Cortez and the \u201cSquad,\u201d using the group of Congress members as a kind of proxy for the liberal proposals that they have dubbed socialistic.Some Democrats expressed doubts that the endorsement will do much to change Sanders\u2019s political fortunes.Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Sen.(D-N.Y.), said that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s appearance at Sanders\u2019s rally on Saturday would give his campaign a short-lived media boost, but that it would do little to give him the sustained momentum he needs ahead of the first primaries and caucuses.\u201cCertainly every camera is going to be there on Saturday,\u201d Reinish said. \u201cBut does it change one single vote? That\u2019s the ultimate question and I don\u2019t see it doing so.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
