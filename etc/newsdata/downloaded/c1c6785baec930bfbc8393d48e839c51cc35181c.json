The fever was found in a farm in the Gifu Prefecture, central Japan.\n\nThe fever detected in Japan is a different strain from the deadly African swine fever that China has been battling, Japan\u2019s agriculture ministry has previously said.\n\nThe disease found in Gifu is also known as hog cholera. It occurs among pigs, wild boar and is not infectious for humans.\n\nJapan is the world\u2019s 10th largest pork producer, and exports about 12 billion yen ($111 million) worth of pork products annually.\n\nPork prices in China, the world\u2019s top consumer of the meat, have hit a record after an epidemic of African swine fever swept through the country\u2019s pig herd, killing millions.\n\n($1 = 108.0700 yen)", "description": "Japanese officials have culled 753 pigs in Saitama Prefecture north of Tokyo after detecting an outbreak of swine fever, the Yomiuri newspaper said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
