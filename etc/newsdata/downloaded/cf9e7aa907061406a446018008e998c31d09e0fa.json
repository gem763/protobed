Please be in no doubt that the game will be suspended and may be abandoned if racist behaviour continues amongst spectators. Help everyone enjoy the game and say no to racism. Thank you.\u2019\n\nFA statement on the racist abuse in Bulgaria The FA can confirm that England players were subjected to abhorrent racist chanting while playing in the EURO 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria. This is unacceptable at any level of the game and our immediate focus is supporting the players and staff involved. As we are sadly aware, this is not the first time our players have been subjected to this level of abuse and there is no place for this kind of behaviour in society, let alone in football. We will be asking UEFA to investigate as a matter of urgency.\n\nUEFA have a three-step protocol in place for dealing with racism at games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Southgate made a complaint to the officials over the chanting midway through the first half, England debutant Mings informed the linesman over racism coming his way from the stands.\n\n\u2018Did you hear that?\u2019 the defender could be heard saying to the nearby official.\n\nSouthgate complained to officials as the first half was stopped on two occasions\u2026\n\nSpeaking after the final whistle, Southgate hit out at the \u2018unacceptable\u2019 racism from Bulgaria supporters which marred England\u2019s win.\n\n\u2018I have to say that the officials were onto everything very quickly,\u2019 the England manager told ITV Sport.\n\n\u2018We reported everything immediately when we heard things. We had constant communication with the officials and referee and I was in contact with the players during the first half in particular and then again at half-time.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an unacceptable situation. I think we\u2019ve made two statements really by winning the game but also we have raised the awareness of everybody to the situation.\n\n\u2018The game was stopped twice and I know for some people that won\u2019t be enough but I think we as a group were on board with that process.\u2019\n\nMORE: England debutant Tyrone Mings makes complaint to linesman over Bulgaria fans\u2019 racist chanting", "description": "Both Tyrone Mings and Gareth Southgate complained to officials over racist chanting from the stands in Sofia during England's Euro 2020 qualifier with Bulgaria.
