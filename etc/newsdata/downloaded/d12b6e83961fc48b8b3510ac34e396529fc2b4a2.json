I went on television the day after he was elected and I said, \u2018I\u2019m willing to give him the bene\ufb01t of the doubt,'\u201d De Niro said in a newly-released interview with British GQ. \u201cBut he\u2019s worse than we ever thought he would be. He\u2019s an idiot. He\u2019s a fool. He\u2019s a buffoon. He\u2019s silly. He\u2019s tacky. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe Goodfellas star then blamed fans of the president\u2019s former reality television program \u2014 The Apprentice \u2014 for creating what he claims is a \u201cmonster\u201d in the White House.\n\n\u201cThat stupid show The Apprentice, people bought it. They buy into it\u2026They created a monster,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAsked if President Trump has \u201cblood on his hands\u201d for the El, Paso, Texas, shooting, where the alleged gunman is believed to have harbored anti-immigrant views, De Niro said he believes that he does.\n\n\u201cYeah. I think he does. And everyone is realizing that now, more and more,\u201d the veteran actor said. \u201cIt\u2019s so preposterous that the NRA has a grip on the Republicans. It\u2019s all about money.\u201d\n\n\u2018They\u2019re beyond shame. Those [gunmen] are crazy people, but they\u2019re inspired by Trump and what he\u2019s allowed,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s all subtle but it\u2019s all there. He\u2019s allowed it. He starts it. He encourages it.\u201d\n\nDe Niro, one of Hollywood\u2019s most high-profile and vocal Trump critics, has used a litany of profanities to describe the president, branding him a \u201cmotherfuck,\u201d \u201cjerk-off\u201d and a \u201cwhite supremacists.\u201d This year, he rocketed to resistance folk-hero fame for his portrayed special counsel Robert Mueller on Saturday Night Live.\n\nPresident Trump has returned fire at De Niro, calling him a \u201cvery Low IQ individual\u201d while aboard Air Force One as he returned to the U.S. from Singapore in June.\n\n\u201cRobert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received to (sic) many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be \u2018punch-drunk.\u2019 I guess he doesn\u2019t realize the economy is the best it\u2019s ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country.
