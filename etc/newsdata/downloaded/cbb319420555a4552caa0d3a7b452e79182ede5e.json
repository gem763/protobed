Crude oil prices are witnessing a rally since the beginning of September backed by Saudi Arabia\u2019s commitment to cut production and Iraq\u2019s decision to follow suit. Conservative demand estimate and overblown global recessionary concerns also boosted oil prices.\n\n\n\nCrude Oil Prices Rally\n\n\n\nLate in the evening on Sep 10, the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that U.S. crude inventories plunged by 7.2 million barrels in the week ended Sep 6 to 421.9 million. Likewise, gasoline stocks fell by 4.5 million barrels.\n\n\n\nFollowing the news, on Sep 11, U.S. benchmark of crude oil price, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures increased 54 cents or 0.9% to $57.94 a barrel. Similarly, the global oil benchmark, the Brent Crude futures rose 51 cents or 0.6% to $62.89 a barrel. Both crude oil prices were the highest since Jul 31.\n\n\n\nCrucial OPEC Meeting\n\n\n\nOn Sep 12, the OPEC and its allies will meet in Abu Dhabi to take a decision on oil production level as U.S. production is approaching 12.4 million barrels per day. U.S. oil production touched 12,123,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD). It declined by 33,000 BOPD in June and is expected to decline more in July. However, these declines in oil production were mainly due to natural calamities.\n\n\n\nThe glut in global oil supply is creating downward pressure on oil prices. The 11-member OPEC led by Saudi Arabia and 10 allies led by Russia will discuss possible steps to restore and stabilize oil prices.\n\n\n\nMoreover, at his speech at the World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said that the organization\u2019s previous estimate of oil demand for 2019 is likely to turn out conservative since fears of an immediate global recession are overblown.\n\n\n\nA fresh round of trade negotiation between the United States and China will start from Oct 1. Additionally, several governments and central banks have either injected stimulus or are likely to do so this month.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia Confirms Production Cut\n\n\n\nOn Sep 9, the new Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who recently replaced Khalid al-Falih, reiterated the Middle-East oil behemoth\u2019s pledge to abide by a global deal to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day.\n\n\n\nNotably, OPEC\u2019s oil supply increased in August for the first time this year as higher level of production from Iraq and Nigeria outpaced output restraint by Saudi Arabia and shrinkage of oil export from Iran due to U.S. sanctions.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on Sep 10, Thamer Ghadhban, oil minister of Iraq said that the second-largest oil producer of OPEC will comply with the cartel\u2019s production cuts from this month after months of overproduction. In August, Iraq reported its highest oil production at 4.6 million barrels per day.\n\n\n\nOur Top Picks\n\n\n\nAt this stage, investment in stocks engaged in exploration, production, refining and marketing of oil will be lucrative.
