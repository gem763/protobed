Absolutely nothing.\"\n\nDoctors had tested Blake for numerous conditions, including meningitis , but each one came back with a negative result.\n\n\"Every test got closer and closer to ANE,\" Kirsty said.\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail / MEN Media)\n\n\"As soon as they showed us - I can't even describe it, it was shattering.\n\n\"We knew straight away what little chance there was of survival and even if he did how catastrophic the effects would be.\n\n\"It was like living in a nightmare, like it wasn't really happening.\"\n\nBlake remained in the coma for two weeks with mum Kirsty and stepfather Joseph Dowell by his bedside.\n\nJoseph, 32, even lost his job because he stayed at the hospital with his stepson.\n\nBlake spent five months at Sheffield Children's Hospital before travelling to a specialist rehabilitation centre in Tadworth, Surrey, called The Children's Trust.\n\nHis older brothers Kayleb, eight, and Haydon, 11, stayed with their grandparents in Hull, leaving the family \"literally torn apart\".\n\nThe family raised funds at the time to allow Blake's brothers to travel down to see him at the weekends.\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail / MEN Media)\n\nAnd Joseph said they have been trying ever since to get Blake back on his feet, now fundraising to help get him the treatment he needs.\n\n\"Just two years ago Blake was a perfectly normal, healthy four-year-old boy,\" he said.\n\n\"Now he's severely disabled - he can only take a few steps as long as we hold him up, he has most of his diet through a feeding tube, he can't speak.\n\n\"It's taken away everything from him.\"\n\nThe exact link between viral infections and ANE is still mostly unknown and there is no cure, only supportive treatments. Many are not available on the NHS.\n\nOnly one in three people survive the disease, with far fewer going on to make a full recovery.\n\n\"There's literally no prognosis, we've been told it's anybody's guess - those exact words,\" Joseph said.\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail / MEN Media)\n\n\"We've just battled and battled from when he was in his coma, to when they told us the worst could be real.\n\n\"You have to go on blind faith and we've never stopped. But awareness of it is absolutely key.\n\n\"Even if there's just one family, one individual that might see the symptoms and even just ask the question, 'Could it be?'\n\n\"That might get them to check it early and save the life of a child like Blake.\"\n\nJoseph and Kirsty, who is 27 weeks pregnant, now care for Blake full-time.\n\nAnd although they said it's a constant effort to support him, they are driven by the hope of one day getting their son back, fueled by seeing the tiny improvements which represent massive victories in his recovery.\n\n\"We have to be his voice, his hands. It's 24/7,\" Kirsty said.\n\n\"You get weeks, even months with nothing. Then you get something massive.\n\n\"We took him to the park and put him in a special disability bike, not expecting much.\n\n\"But then he started pedalling.\n\n\"It's really hard work but that's what keeps you going, keeping that hope and thinking, 'What else can he achieve?'\n\n\"We want to do everything we can possibly do to give back the parts of his life that he's lost.\"\n\nAs well as raising awareness for others, Kirsty and Joseph are raising money to pay for treatment that could help Blake.\n\nKirsty said they want to buy him a 'Mollii Suit', an outfit developed by neurological rehabilitation specialists which sends electrical signals to the wearer via the inside of the garments.\n\nIt can help reduce the muscle spasticity caused by the damaged pathways from the brain and improve posture, function and movement.\n\nBut it has a hefty price tag of \u00a34,500.\n\nKirsty said they also want to send him for a new treatment being trialled in Russia on the Pons area of the brain.\n\nIt involves sending electrical signals through the back of the mouth to the affected region to reconnect the broken pathways.\n\nKirsty said she had been in touch with families of other children with ANE and heard that one girl had began talking again and been able to move her arms following the treatment.\n\nBut that too would cost a huge amount - in the region of \u00a320,000.\n\nIt is only once they have been able to afford those treatments that they would move on to more invasive surgical procedures.\n\n\"Blake needs 24-hour care and we put our heart and soul into everything we do with him,\" said Kirsty.\n\n\"We'll do anything - we'll raise millions if we have to.\"\n\nAnyone wanting to support Blake and his family can donate to their GoFundMe page here .", "description": "East Hull six-year-old Blake, 6, got a rare autoimmune disease called acute necrotising encephalopathy after he fell ill with the flu", "authors": ["Nathan Standley", "Image", "Hull Daily Mail", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20701488.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196564890.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
