In the 1970s the school's music department was housed in a two-room wooden hut adjacent to playing fields.\n\nIn 2013 Mr Snow gave the school $8 million of his own money for a centre for the New Asian Century, as well donating $250,000 from his personal wealth to improve safety in equestrian sport following a double fatality earlier that year.\n\nThe music centre will be built largely underground, below historical buildings. In addition to the auditorium, it will include four classrooms, 20 music tuition rooms, a staff room and a 450 square metre library.\n\nIn the 1970s the school's music department was housed in a two-room wooden hut in a remote location on the campus.\n\nHead of the school, Justin Garrick, said the new music centre would be positioned at the main entrance of the school.\n\nHe said the school's combined primary and senior students contributed to 30 music ensembles and took 330 instrumental tuition classes a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Mr Snow\u2019s exceptional gift will accelerate the school over more than a decade of development, benefiting thousands of current and future students, staff members and families,\" Dr Garrick said.\n\n\"It will place music at the forefront of the school\u2019s educational experience, and it will emphasise the centrality of learning, research and study.\n\n\"The centre will give not just the school, but the Canberra community an outstanding learning facility, meeting space, conference venue, concert hall and community resource for music that will make the school more intrinsic than ever to the educational and cultural life of Australia\u2019s capital.\"\n\nThe next largest donation given to a school by an old boy was a $10 million bequest to Melbourne Grammar School by pastoralist Jack Morrow in the 1990s.\n\nThe Snow family made its wealth with Canberra property development and in 1998 bought the lease of the aviation facilities, land and infrastructure at Canberra Airport, including development rights.", "description": "A former student has made the largest biggest donation to a school for a music centre and scholarships for indigenous Australians.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.394%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_242%2C$y_134/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f89af2afeb409f324b53e4cb70d23eb45847553e", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
