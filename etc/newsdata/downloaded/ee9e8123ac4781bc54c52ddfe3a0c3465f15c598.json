The agency didn\u2019t provide reasons for the reversal.\n\nThe rule would have gone into effect Nov. 1 to conform to a state law that allows any \u201cstreet-legal\u201d vehicle on state and county roads.\n\nInstead, a long-standing ban on ATVs in parks will remain.\n\nAshley Korenblat, an advocate for preserving public lands and CEO of Western Spirit Cycling in Moab, Utah, applauded a move she said will ensure ATVs aren\u2019t crammed into already congested national parks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A rule that would have allowed ATVs on certain roads in the five national parks in Utah has been rescinded by the National Park Service.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brady Mccombs"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
