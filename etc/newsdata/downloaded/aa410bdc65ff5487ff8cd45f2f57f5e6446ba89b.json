Nonetheless, it does point to the contradictions in our lives as men and women grapple with something as ordinary as a hair cut.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), the story goes, visited an upscale Washington, D.C. hair salon and paid a pretty penny for a hair cut and lowlights. Lowlights, for the uninformed, are \u201cpartial or spot hair coloring in which just a few sections of hair are dyed.\u201d She\u2019s young so I\u2019m assuming she isn\u2019t covering gray, just perking up her regular hair color. It\u2019s the hair coloring process that beefs up the final bill.\n\nAlex Swoyer wrote a piece published in The Washington Times documenting AOC\u2019s visit.\n\nThe New York Democrat ventured into Last Tangle Salon on 19th Street Northwest last month and shelled out $80 for a haircut and $180 for lowlights, according to sources familiar with the salon. A 20% tip would have added $52 to the bill.\n\nSwoyer went at the story from the point of view that socialists \u2013 especially politicians \u2013 are hypocrites. Socialists demand legislation that aggressively taxes the fruits of our labor yet they live quite well in their own lives. For example, the two most prominent Socialists in Washington, D.C. are Bernie Sanders and his disciple, AOC. Bernie, as we all know now, owns three houses, including a beach house. Swoyer\u2019s piece was a legitimate criticism.\n\nAOC is a twenty-nine years old single woman living in Washington, D.C., a city that is listed as number 5 out of the 10 most expensive cities in America in which to live. Her home city, New York City, is number one on the list so she is used to a high cost of living. Frankly, she may well think she got a good deal in that salon, depending on what she pays in NYC.\n\nThe problem with the piece arose when a liberal female writer tweeted about the article. She began with: \u201cthis would obvs never be a story about a man\u201d\n\n1) this would obvs never be a story about a man 2) this is not an expensive haircut/color for a public figure who is frequently on TV 3) if her hair was raggedy, that would be the lead story instead 4) \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44https://t.co/CyXaQ860ts \u2014 Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) October 10, 2019\n\nValenti went at it from the sexist angle \u2013 a woman is criticized for her hair care. What Valenti must have missed in the last 30 years, though, is that men, too, have come under fire for hair cuts that seem crazy expensive. Bill Clinton, John Edwards, Mitt Romney were all faulted for spending a lot on their hair. Rick Perry received notice for his preference of $25.00 hair cuts. And so on.\n\nNevertheless, AOC is in the public spotlight. People will talk whether she spends $25.00 or $600.00. I find it much more acceptable to question the exorbitant prices paid by the men, though, to be honest because there is so much less work involved. As a rule, women have longer hair (AOC has long hair) and the whole coloring thing takes time and requires a skilled hair stylist. It\u2019s no secret \u2013 women pay more.\n\nI\u2019m fiscally conservative. I live for a bargain. That isn\u2019t usually possible when it comes to a visit to a hair salon. I\u2019m sure someone recommended this place to AOC and she went. She probably doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to be searching out the best deal. And, as I noted above, it probably isn\u2019t particularly expensive for the area. She is a single, childless professional woman. She makes a salary of $174,000 a year. She can afford a splurge on her hair. At the most, she might go to the salon once a month, but I doubt it is that frequent. Most women go 6 to 8 weeks to keep up with hair color.\n\nCould she do it all cheaper and live a more modest lifestyle? Yes, of course. She lives in an upscale area. The point is she is free to make her own choices. If we were living in her socialist nirvana, her choices would be severely curtailed. That\u2019s the point the liberal virtue-signaling writer missed.\n\nAOC doesn\u2019t have to color her own hair at home like lots of women do because she can afford to visit a hair salon that can remain in business due in part to tax policies. Thanks, President Trump. That business owner\u2019s taxes would be higher if AOC had her way. The cost of living in a large city like D.C. is higher than a less populated place in another part of the country. This is a time when I will stick up for excercising her freedom of choice in hair care. Now, if she starts having her hair done in a plane on a tarmac like Bill Clinton once famously did, all bets are off.\n\nYes, AOC has responded. It\u2019s an apples and oranges kind of response, but her response nonetheless.", "description": "Lowlights", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AOC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
