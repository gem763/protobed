The company intends to debut on the New York Stock Exchange at the end of September, and hopes to pawn off shares at a price range of $30-32, according to filings made with the SEC.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect from Endeavor\u2019s forthcoming foray into the competitive marketplace, and how proceeds from the IPO could supercharge the company as it moves forward.\n\nDon\u2019t count out Endeavor\u2019s talent\n\nThere are many reasons to believe that Endeavor (NYSE:EDR) could enjoy a knockout IPO, beginning with the fact that the company has a sizable talent pool to draw upon when it comes to bolstering its image and convincing investors that its human capital is worthy of backing. Not only is Endeavor the parent company to UFC, but it also owns the powerhouse Hollywood talent agency WME, something it flaunted during the announcement video that revealed to investors the company\u2019s intentions of going public. Initial reports indicate that roughly 19.3 million Class A shares will be sold during the company\u2019s market debut, and Endeavor hopes to raise some $600 million from its IPO if things go well. According to S-1 filings made with the SEC ahead of its IPO, Endeavor won\u2019t be relying solely on the power of its human capital to impress investors, either. The company isn\u2019t yet profitable, but it\u2019s been tidying up its finances in recent years, trimming down losses while bolstering revenue streams.\n\nIn the first six months of 2019, for instance, Endeavor brought in more than $2 billion in revenue compared to the $1.5 billion it generated during the first six months of 2018. Similarly, the company managed to trim its net losses down from $475.6 million to $220.3 million. Mixed martial arts have frequently been labeled the fastest-growing sport in America many times throughout the years, and it\u2019s indisputable that millions of fans across both the country and the rest of the globe are eager to see the UFC expand. Given that the UFC was purchased for a measly $2 million in 2001 and is now a multi-billion dollar property, it\u2019s clear to see that the sport has enjoyed truly mind-boggling growth over the past two decades that could very well endure for years to come. Investors will ultimately be more interested in Endeavor\u2019s finances than they will be in trends across the sporting industry, however, and there are some red flags to consider before backing the company.\n\nEndeavor is managing a hefty debt\n\nPerhaps the biggest blotch on Endeavor\u2019s record is the fact that the company is managing sizable amounts of debt that could turn some investors away in the runup to its IPO. Endeavor is also somewhat embroiled in an ongoing conflict between the Writers Guild of America and various talent agencies under its purview. When Endeavor initially announced its intentions to go public, for instance, the WGA released a withering statement attacking the company and accusing it of profiting off the work of creatives. Nevertheless, many investors may be unconcerned with the legal spat, and much more interested in the amount of debt Endeavor is holding coupled with its post-IPO plans.\n\nWhen Endeavor acquired the UFC for $4 billion back in 2016, for instance, it accrued additional debt that may give some potential investors cold feet. It also purchased IMG for a hefty $2.4 billion in 2014, with its long-term debt totaling around $4.6 billion as of March. Those who are growing concerned with the company\u2019s willingness to accrue debt have one reassurance, however. According to its prospectus, Endeavor intends to use most of its IPO proceeds to pare down its debt to a more manageable level, something many investors will doubtlessly be relieved to hear. It seems that Endeavor is eager to focus on tamping down its hefty debts while simultaneously pivoting deeper and deeper into the entertainment industry.\n\nThe company has also garnered some positive press coverage in recent times; in response to Saudi Arabia\u2019s murdering a journalist from the Washington Post, for instance, the company announced it would be returning the $400 million investment from that country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Nevertheless, Wall Street may not so much be concerned with Endeavor\u2019s moral standing as it is with the company\u2019s debt levels, which investors must keep in mind when mulling their financial prospect. Still, Endeavor has shown that it has a serious capacity to bolster revenue streams while mitigating its ongoing losses, which indicates it has a positive financial future ahead of it. As Endeavor prepares to enter into a competitive marketplace, those counting the company out should reconsider its very serious potential.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Alex Newman covering: .
