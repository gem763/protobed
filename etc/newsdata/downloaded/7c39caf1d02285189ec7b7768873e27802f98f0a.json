Our advice is that this is simply not the case, and is a broad legal matter to be determined by the courts.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnother healthcare industry CEO said that if these doctors were to be found to be NHDS staff, it could have huge financial consequences for the company and its owners, who might have to pay superannuation, taxes, and annual leave entitlements.\n\nThe former Labor senator Sam Dastyari was on the board of the National Home Doctor Service. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nMedicare and the PSR conduct audits of doctors regularly across all areas of health, and not just the after-hours segment.\n\nPSR director Julie Quinlivan is responsible for protecting the integrity of the MBS and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Her agency can disqualify doctors (not companies) from billing certain items. She can seek to claw back repayment of misclaimed MBS benefits.\n\nIn the 2019 fiscal year, the agency recovered more than $29 million in fees \u2013 nearly triple the amount recovered just three years ago.\n\nMr Pappalardo declined to comment on the audit findings of NHDS doctors, adding that he is \"confident of a positive outcome\" in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPRS general counsel Bruce Topperwien confirmed the Health Department referred a number of practitioners as well as NHDS to the agency for review.\n\n\"We have been dealing with each practitioner in their own right, and only just started dealing with NHDS,\" he said.\n\n\"Of all of those (1200) practitioners, it was more likely those 56 were employees, and would be caught by the provision of the Act,\" Mr Topperwein said.\n\nHe said that in the period under review \u2013 roughly two years ago \u2013 there had been public advertising by NHDS calling practitioners \u2018\u2018our doctors\u2019\u2019. Practitioners had to identify themselves as NHDS doctors on arriving at a patient\u2019s home and had to wear an NHDS lanyard and follow the dress code set by the company.\n\nRange of factors\n\nHe said the question as to whether someone was an employee or not depended on a range of factors, and was not restricted to what was in the contracts.\n\nNHDS has had some high-profile board members in the past, including Howard government health minister Dr Michael Wooldridge and former Labor senator Sam Dastyari. There is no suggestion they have done anything wrong.\n\nAccording to the Health Insurance Act, if a company recklessly, negligently or knowingly causes or permits a practitioner employed by them to engage in inappropriate practices, they are said to be engaging in inappropriate practice.\n\nThe federal government last year widened the scope of the Act to try to hold companies accountable for contracted doctors' inappropriate Medicare billing.\n\nOne healthcare analyst said there remained a need for the out of hours doctor service because if it was not available, \"people go to the ED and clog the system\", but there is a risk to the business model because the government is paying triple the cost in some cases, so it has to change.\n\nA hearing has been set for March 2020.", "description": "Australia's largest network of home visiting doctors says it cannot be held accountable for their actions because they are contractors, not staff.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_94/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/48cbaa985aa61b084f15289055d3f77a35605e96", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
