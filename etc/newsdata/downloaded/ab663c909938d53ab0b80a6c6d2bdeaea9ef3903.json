The Nationals made it possible by winning 7-2, over the Houston Astros in a game that was upstaged by controversy, Nats manager Dave Martinez being ejected, and resurrected memories of first-base umpire Don Denkinger\u2019s blown call in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series. Max Scherzer, who was scratched from his Game 5 start, is set to pitch the decisive game for the Nationals, while Zack Greinke takes the mound for the Astros\n\nMillions brace for blackouts as California's Kincade, Getty fires rage\n\nFirefighter\u2019s efforts to battle the raging Kincade Fire in Northern California could be hampered by gusts reaching 60 to 70 mph through Wednesday evening, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Paul Walker warned. The blaze, which had consumed more than 115 square miles, had damaged or destroyed more than 220 buildings and was only 15% contained Tuesday. About 200,000 people had been forced to evacuate the area, but the National Weather Service said almost 18 million Californians were living in areas where the fire risk was critical. Another 3.2 million face an extreme risk, the service said. In Los Angeles, the Getty Fire had burned through more than 650 acres, damaging or destroying more than a dozen homes, threatening 7,000 more and forcing thousands of residents to flee.\n\nCLOSE The Kincade, Getty and Tick fires are some of many wildfires that are raging through California. They have led to mass evacuations and power outages. USA TODAY\n\nU.S. reading, math scores aren't getting any better\n\nFourth and eighth grade reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress haven't budged in a decade, a new report released Wednesday finds. Specifically, 35% of fourth-graders were proficient in reading in 2019, down from 37% in 2017, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which administers the NAEP to a representative sample of students across the country every two years. Math scores didn't fare much better: About 41% of fourth-graders and 34% of eighth-graders scored proficient in math in 2019, not significantly different from 2017. So why are the scores so low? Some experts theorize that children don't spend enough time practicing reading fluency or developing their vocabulary, while others believe students are subjected to far too many tests, which leaves less time for instruction.\n\nBoeing CEO to testify before House committee\n\nBoeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg is scheduled to testify before a House committee Wednesday, a day after being grilled by the Senate. During Tuesday's testimony, Muilenburg defended the aerospace company's safety inspection system, despite two crashes that have grounded its 737 Max jetliner. He also disclosed he was notified before the second crash of a test pilot's signal of \"egregious\" problems with the Max's flight control system, now believed to be at fault in the plane's two crashes. Not only will the 737 Max not fly again until all agree it is safe, Muilenburg said, but Boeing also is reviewing all its safety policies. Tuesday\u2019s hearing was attended by family members of the 346 people who lost their lives in the crashes.\n\nWhat Boeing and CEO Dennis Muilenburgneed to answer about the twin 737 Max jet crashes.\n\nLast hurrah for Fed rate cuts?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates for the third time this year after its two-day meeting that ends Wednesday. But will that be the end of cuts? Economists are divided on whether Fed officials will leave the door wide open to another cut at their next meeting in December or hint that they\u2019re inclined to pause. Since the Fed last cut rates in mid-September, a sluggish global economy and the U.S.-China trade war have dinged the economy somewhat, but job growth and consumer spending have remained solid. Whatever Fed policymakers signal is likely to move stock markets, and their rate decision will determine whether consumer borrowing costs and bank savings rates will continue to edge down.\n\nBoon to buyers? US home prices up as a whole, but cool in major markets\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/30/world-series-game-7-nationals-astros-california-wildfires-boeing/2496459001/", "description": "The World Series heads to a Game 7, millions brace for blackouts as California wildfires continue and more things to start your Wednesday morning.", "authors": ["Editors", "Usa Today", "Published A.M.
