Two crucial votes will take place following the debate on Tuesday. The first vote determines whether the bill has enough support from lawmakers and the second whether there is enough time for parliamentarians to scrutinise it before the U.K.\u2019s scheduled departure from the European Union in nine days.\n\nFollowing the debate, at around 18:00 GMT, the Second Reading vote will take place, where MPs vote on the principle of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. This vote should be indicative of Johnson\u2019s chances of getting his Brexit bill through.\n\nLatest media reports suggest that the PM has just enough support to get the bill through, with the ousted 21 moderate Conservatives expected to vote in favour of the bill. The opposition Labour Party is reported to be voting against the bill, however, the government could see some support from rebel Labour MPs who represent constituencies that voted overwhelmingly for Brexit.\n\nWhile Johnson may get the vote on the principle of the Bill over the line, he may not have the required support in the subsequent vote on the timetabling of the bill.\n\nAt around 18:15 GMT, parliament will bring a so-called \u2018programme motion\u2019 detailing the timing of the withdrawal agreement bill's legislative passage.\n\nThe programme motion has a much greater risk of being ambushed as the opposition may call for greater scrutiny of the bill than the currently proposed tight timetable allows. The government is hoping to have its final say on the Withdrawal Bill on Thursday evening.\n\nOn Wednesday, parliament will also debate a series of proposed amendments to the bill, which could include a customs union with the EU and a second referendum on the final deal.\n\nThe government insists that the U.K. will leave the European Union on Oct. 31. While a request for an extension has been requested from the EU, it is still uncertain if this will be granted and under what terms.\n\nWatch Live: U.K. Parliament to Vote on Boris Johnson's Brexit Deal\n\nThe pound hit is holding above and above .", "description": "Watch Live: U.K. Parliament to Vote on Boris Johnson's Brexit Deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE5C13B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
