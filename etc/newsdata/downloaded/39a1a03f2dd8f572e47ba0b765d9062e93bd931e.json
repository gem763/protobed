To go back farther, it was 130th in 2016. More impressive is the fact that for the third consecutive time India was among the world\u2019s top 10 performers.\n\nTwo of India\u2019s neighbours, Pakistan and China, were also among the top 10 improvers.\n\nDoing Business ranking is based on 12 metrics and covers two cities in India, Mumbai and Delhi. According to World Bank, it measures aspects of business regulation affecting small business firms located in the largest business city.\n\nAs India\u2019s population exceeds 100 million, the data is collected from two cities.\n\nThe report is balanced in the sense that it highlights some areas it does not measure such as corruption.\n\nHow is the measurement undertaken?\n\nAccording to World Bank, it is undertaken primarily on the basis of the statute books.\n\n\u201cApproximately, two-thirds of the data embedded in the Doing Business indicators are based on a reading of the law,\u201d says the Doing Business 2020 report.\n\nHow does one put the report and India\u2019s performance in perspective?\n\nIndia\u2019s performance is impressive and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government deserves credit for making a persistent attempt to remove obstacles to ease of doing business. However, it is not enough to make big difference to the investment climate.\n\nTo illustrate, the rankings of Vietnam and Bangladesh provide food for thought. These countries are held up as good examples in an independent World Bank report on global value chains. Both countries are among top performers in exports in their areas of strength.\n\nIn the case of Vietnam it is electronics. Bangladesh has now become a top performer in apparel and textile exports.\n\nIn Doing Business 2020 rankings, Vietnam stands at 70 and Bangladesh at 168.\n\nPakistan is ranked 108th even though it hasn\u2019t achieved anything on the scale Bangladesh has in the recent past.\n\nThe takeaway is that impressive as India\u2019s performance is, there is a lot more to enhancing competitiveness of domestic firms and making them resilient in a competitive world. The government shouldn\u2019t lose focus on that.", "description": "India\u2019s performance in the World Bank\u2019s annual Doing Business ranking continues to improve.
