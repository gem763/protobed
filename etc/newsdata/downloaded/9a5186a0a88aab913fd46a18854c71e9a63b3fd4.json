Trump, in allowing the Turkish incursion was, in reality, clearing a path for Assad and Russia to regain control over northeast Syria.\n\nDespite his constant blabber about Obama\u2019s failures in Syria, Trump has just echoed his policy. Obama looked the other way when Russia decided in 2015 to fully intervene and crush the opposition. Trump has effectively granted a licence to Russia to finish the Kurds (using a Turkish enforcer) in 2019.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It wants to be seen as an honest deal broker, and the future flagship for stability in Syria. Trump has helpfully shepherded Putin towards this goal.\n\nThe US president\u2019s \u201csand and death\u201d doctrine on Syria pulled the plug on any western involvement and dovetailed neatly with Putin\u2019s long-term objective of knocking out the Americans and Europeans. Under the Syrian peace process discussed in Astana, Russia forced the UN to back Putin\u2019s promoted Syrian Constitutional Committee last month, his first step towards a peaceful resolution.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Meanwhile, Turkey will bear the brunt of a rejuvenated Isis, Assad still has a long way to go in Idlib fighting al-Qaeda affiliates and as it deals with the humanitarian crisis throughout the country.\n\nThe only true winner is Russia.\n\nFrom its new position of strength, Russia can guarantee contracts of exclusive access to the oil-rich area in northeast Syria, and holds sway over a large launch pad for influence across the whole Middle East and Africa. Russia is already involved in propping up General Khalifa Haftar in Libya, and still pushing for establishing military bases in Egypt.\n\nTrump has left even his voters utterly baffled. If the pullback of 1,000 soldiers from Syria has anything to do with his campaign promises to \u201cbring our troops home\u201d, why did he decide last week to send almost 3,000 extra troops to Saudi Arabia? Of course, the Kurds have no cash to pay.\n\nThe attack on the Saudi oil facility of Abqaiq, the drawdown of US troops from Syria, Turkey\u2019s incursion into northeast Syria, and President Putin\u2019s visit to the Gulf today mark a rapid transformation away from the post-second world war American hegemony.\n\nRussia still has a long way to go to present a real alternative to the US, but it does appear to be sprinting in this direction.\n\nGCC countries seem to be so frustrated that they have steadily become willing to grant Russia a fresh and clear mandate in the Gulf. For them, the message behind Trump\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds in Syria was clear: the US has no consistent or coherent strategy of containment against Iran\u2019s influence in the region, and has no desire to protect its allies. This is despite huge Gulf payments being funnelled into the American economy.\n\nTrump showed great reluctance to go beyond economic sanctions in his tentative moves towards Iran, even though he kept up the bogeyman rhetoric, most likely in the hope he would keep the flow of cash rolling. Now though, he has made way for the Turks to proceed with what many believe to be the kickoff in a future permanent settlement in Syria under Russia\u2019s terms, and with Iran\u2019s consent.\n\nPutin has already offered the Saudis the S-400 anti-aircraft system to protect themselves against the drones and ballistic missiles attacks by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.\n\nThe Saudis and Emiratis once saw Trump as a historical opportunity to curb regional rivals in the region, but they are now having a change of heart. Putin\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia and the UAE is a delicate strategic calculation from those two wealthy countries, which reflects their great anxiety towards the likelihood of having to deal with an erratic Trump (if he is to win in 2020) for the next five years.\n\nIt may even be that Putin\u2019s advance in the Middle East also delivers an opportunity in Ukraine, where the new president will be infuriated to be dragged into a US impeachment inquiry. Russia is searching in the ruins of that crisis for a way to secure leverage over its western neighbour. That may yet come to pass, but what is certain is that the new reality in Syria pushes Turkey much closer to Russia, and away from the volatile western powers who have been bashing Erdogan since the start of his operation.\n\nIn the past three years \u2013 since Trump took office \u2013 US influence has been draining in the Middle East, and Russia\u2019s has been rising. It has been a startling turnaround, especially if we wonder what might happen if Trump stays in the White House for another five years.", "description": "Donald Trump has handed Vladimir Putin a free gift in Syria by forcing the Kurds to strike a deal with Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime to hand over Manbij, Kobane and other areas along the border to the Syrian army in their final push to survive Erdogan\u2019s assault.
