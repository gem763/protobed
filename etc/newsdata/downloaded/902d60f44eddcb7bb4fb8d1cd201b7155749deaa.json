This is a problem that affects all of us equally. We\u2019re just asking people to make a small commitment to change.\u201d\n\nBetter than 'meh': Apple Maps is improved, but still is no Google Maps\n\nAnd in more mapping news: Google Maps will let you plan 'mixed modes' of travel for complicated, multipart trips\n\nWith the Waze Carpool app, you type in your ZIP code to find local neighbors who live within a block or two from you and are willing to have you ride along with them to work. Unlike traditional ride-hailing apps like Uber or Lyft, you're not guaranteed a ride.\n\nA neighbor has to be willing to pick you up and be available to leave at similar times. In a test of the app for this article, for a Monday morning pickup between 7 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. in a suburb of Los Angeles, no driver has yet to raise a hand.\n\n\u201cWe have to stop driving alone.\u201d Noam Bardin, CEO of Waze\n\nIn an ideal world, riders would all work in the same corporate building and thus leave at similar times and all be headed to the same location, says Bardin.\n\nFolks who are interested in driving the passengers need to register in the Waze navigation app, at the bottom right of the main screen, under \"Carpool.\"\n\nThe Waze App in a Chevrolet Silverado Monday, September 10, 2018 in Detroit, Michigan.

It\u2019s up to you. The service is you and a small number of people sharing rides. This is not for you coming home from a bar drunk. It\u2019s a community transit service.\u201d\n\nDrivers won\u2019t make money offering rides, but instead break even, Bardin says. \u201cIt covers the cost of gas and wear and tear.\u201d The charge is 58 cents per mile.\n\nWaze, which operates under the Google banner as an independent unit from Israel, has found the most success for car pools in the San Francisco Bay area, followed by Dallas, Texas and Brazil, Bardin says.\n\n\u201cThere is a way to win this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will take change of behavior, but it can be done.\u201d\n\nBut Bardin has a huge challenge ahead of him. Despite being out for a year, a quick check of the Waze Carpool app on the current Top 100 downloads for Apple's iOS and Google Play found no ranking. The Waze app itself is No. 69 on the iOS chart and No. 85 on Google Play.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/10/google-waze-carpool-app-anniversary/3900303002/", "description": "Company CEO hoped Waze would help solve traffic issues, but that didn't happen.
