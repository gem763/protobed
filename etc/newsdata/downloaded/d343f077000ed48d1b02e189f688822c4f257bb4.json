The Intelligent Spine Interface Project is exactly what it sounds like, using AI to bypass injuries to a person's spinal cord, so they can once more have bladder control and movement.\n\n\"This exploratory study aims to build the toolset-the mix of hardware, software and functional understanding of the spinal cord-to make such a system possible,\" said David Borton, assistant professor at Brown's School of Engineering.\n\nThe effort, expected to take two years, will see scientists capture motor and sensory signals from the spinal cord in order to train their AI. Then, in a paralyzed patient, surgeons can implant electrodes at both ends of a spinal injury.\n\nDon't Miss 125 SHARES\n\nEffectively, that will allow them to rewire a person's spinal cord, bypassing the injured nerves, and using the AI to replicate signals sent from the spine to other parts of the body. Aside from research assistance, Intel will also be hopefully providing the tools to run these neural networks locally to facilitate rehabilitation.\n\nTo start with, the team is working on building an interface that works with an external computing system. Once that's done, they can get to work on miniaturization, so implants can be self-contained nerve damage bypasses.\n\nFrankly, this is an ambitious plan to say the least. If it succeeds, it could succeed in restoring movement to patients paralysed by spinal injuries. And it should be successful even if it fails, perhaps even improving the capabilities of prosthetic limbs, and who knows what else?", "description": "We\u2019ve already begun to utilize AI in medicine, though mostly on the research and diagnosis side, given how good it is at pattern and analysis.
