He\u2019s super rich, he flies around everywhere. If you want, you can come by for an interview.\u2019\u201d\n\nGiuffre said Maxwell led her to Epstein, who was laying naked on a massage table, and that\u2019s when the two exchanged a \u201cCheshire grin,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe smiled and nodded, as in, like, approval.\u201d\n\nGiuffre said even after Maxwell ordered her to perform sex acts on Epstein during their first meeting, she went back again because they\u2019d promised they could help her become a real masseuse.\n\nShe said she viewed dealing with Epstein at the time as a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d to get out of a life of abuse and into a \u201cnormal life.\u201d\n\nBut she soon learned that his \u201clife revolved around abuse,\u201d she said.\n\nEventually, she said Maxwell trained her to recruit new girls for Epstein.\n\n\u201cJeffrey was very particular in the kind of girls he wanted. First off, the younger the better.\u201d\n\nEpstein said that to her, Giuffre claimed, and \u201cMaxwell said that too. During the training and telling me how to do it, she said \u2018You always have to go for the youngest-looking ones.\u2019\u201d\n\nGiuffre said she reluctantly brought other girls to Epstein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll always haunt me.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Epstein\u2019s accusers have alleged that Maxwell served as the money-man's madam to lure new girls into his operation, though Maxwell has denied all allegations against her and has not been charged with any crime.\n\nChauntae Davies, who has alleged she was raped by Epstein on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, also told NBC that she was first brought to Epstein by Maxwell.\n\n\u201cJust do whatever he likes and you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Davies said Maxwell told her.\n\nGiuffre said she was expected to be on call for Epstein every day, all day.\n\n\u201c He wanted all of us to be his little Lolita. \u201d\n\n\u201cI had to pretend like I was happy. You couldn\u2019t just be depressed around Jeffrey. You had to pretend like \u2026 like I told you, he wanted all of us to be his little Lolita.\u201d\n\nSeveral months in, when she was 17, Giuffre said she was instructed to start having sex with other men at Epstein\u2019s request.\n\nAfter flying to London, she said, \u201cGhislaine woke me up in the morning excited. And she said, \u2018You\u2019re going to meet a prince today.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said she first met Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew at a nightclub before being told by Maxwell to \u201cdo for him what you do for Epstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe abuse went on for a little bit in the bathroom\u201d at Maxwell\u2019s London home, Giuffre said. \u201cAnd then it continued to the bedroom. And he wasn\u2019t rude or anything about it. He said, you know, \u2018Thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said she was later directed to have sex with Prince Andrew on Epstein\u2019s private island, an incident which she said stands out in her mind because \u201che was a prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grew up watching Disney \u2026 and princes and princesses were the good people of the world,\u201d she said.\n\nPrince Andrew has denied having any relationship with Giuffre, and while he acknowledged knowing Epstein, he has maintained he had no knowledge of any of Epstein\u2019s crimes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to keep denying that it ever happened. But he knows the truth. And I know the truth,\u201d Giuffre said.\n\nFor Giuffre and Epstein\u2019s other accusers, the convicted sex offender\u2019s suicide in his Manhattan jail cell last month only makes it more important for his alleged accomplices to be held accountable.\n\n\u201cI think that \u2026 there should still be some accountability for a lot of the people that were enabling Epstein. You know, there are still people out there, like Ghislaine Maxwell,\u201d said Jennifer Araoz, who said Epstein raped her in his New York home when she was 15. Araoz is suing both Maxwell and Epstein's estate over the alleged rape.\n\nBritish actress Anouska De Georgiou, another alleged victim of Epstein's, struck a defiant tone in the Dateline interview: \u201cJeffrey thought that we were disposable. And he threw us all away. And look who\u2019s still standing.\u201d", "description": "Virginia Roberts Giuffre said that Epstein\u2019s life \u201crevolved around abuse\u201d\u2014and that he had plenty of people helping him get a steady supply of underage girls.", "authors": ["Allison Quinn", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_701,w_1247,x_72,y_301/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569038781/RTS2O2TC_1_xyxuoz", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
