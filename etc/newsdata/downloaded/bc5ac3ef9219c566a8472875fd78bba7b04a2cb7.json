Now that you've picked up all the beauty essentials and the gadgets you'll need to make this semester successful, it's time to think about adding a little personality to that rather bleak room you're inhabiting. So we're sharing the dorm decor looks we love. We've even sourced the corresponding pieces so that you can shop the look. They're affordable \u2014 with a few splurges thrown in here and there \u2014 and we hope they'll make the transition to dorm life a little better and more stylish!\n\nDark but cozy\n\n(Source: ikea.com)\n\nThis dorm room from Ikea is exactly what we want for upcoming cozy fall afternoons. Pair greys and blues for a welcoming space. Plenty of hanging fabrics lend a cozy feel, and strands of lights help cast a warm glow for all those nights of course readings. We also love that these neutrals pair perfectly with wood furniture, which is likely what was awaiting you when you arrived at your new dorm.\n\nRemovable wallpaper exists and it's a beautiful thing. This peel and stick wallpaper comes in tons of different patterns, but we particularly like this geo print in navy. Instead of doing an entire wall, opt for a small accent wall, or use it to create a headboard design behind your school-supplied lacklustre bed frame.\n\nGeo Wallpaper, about $65 CAD, Society6\n\nJust like in our inspo pic, these sheets are a stylish, neutral and pair perfectly with blues for the ultimate study space this semester. This set is pure cotton and both the duvet cover and pillowcase zip shut to keep the pieces inside in their place.\n\nHJ\u00c4RTSTILLA Duvet Cover and Pillowcase, $79.99, Ikea\n\nLuxe crushed velvet is exactly what fall calls for. These tufted floor cushions serve as added seating and add a little texture to your space.\n\nVelvet Floor Pillow, $59, Urban Outfitters\n\nAs seen in the inspo pic, firefly lights add a warm glow to your dorm. And, at 98 feet long, this delicate strand of copper lights is all you'll need!\n\nExtra Long Copper Firefly String Lights, $74, Urban Outfitters\n\nThis room divider may feel like a splurge, but it can offer some seriously-needed storage space, not to mention an element of personal space, to a shared room. We love its industrial, vintage vibe and it's a piece that will easily transition into your first apartment.\n\nVEBER\u00d6D Room Divider, $149, Ikea\n\nThose beige walls need some help. Adorn them with pretty print from Juniper Print Shop. The beauty of this company is that you pay a set fee for the image and then you're free to print it as many times as you want, at whatever size you desire! For a room like this, we particularly like these two images. The nautical print adds a vintage feel to any space, the black and white cityscape is a classic and they both fit with the colour scheme. FYI: For a deal, you can sign up for their newsletter and get a code for \"buy two get one free.\"\n\nNautical Print and Ann Street Print, from about $26 each, Juniper Print Shop\n\nBlack and white and boho\n\n\u200b (Credit: anthropologie.com)\n\nYou can't go wrong with classic black and white \u2014 especially with a bit of boho thrown in. For this look, we're taking styling inspo from Anthropologie. Just as in this setup, aim for plenty of texture, and it's easy to achieve with rugs, throw pillows and embroidered bedding. Keep things classy and clean with framed black and white prints. And since your room will be small (we guarantee it), try subbing in a chair as a nightstand as they did in the pic above. It's perfect for holding your current reading list, and it doubles as extra seating when you have company.\n\nTexture is everything with a very simple colour scheme like this one, plus, the more pillows on your bed, the comfier studying will be. Look for cream, white and black accent pillows like this one and your room will be particularly stylish.\n\nCushion, $36, V de V Maison\n\nStyle meets snuggly with this piece so we're 100% on board. This fleece blanket mixes in perfectly and it's as soft as can be.\n\nAmped Fleece Printed Throw Blanket, $59.99, Urban Outfitters\n\nThe star of our inspo image above, this quilt embodies the boho aesthetic we're after. It's a bit of a splurge, but we absolutely love the embroidered elements. And it may feature an embroidered jacquard front, but it's machine washable and dryer-safe, which is ideal for when you inevitably spill coffee all over it.\n\nEmbroidered Lilou Quilt, from about $200 to $227, Anthropologie\n\nBehold! A laundry basket that's actually aesthetically pleasing! It's pretty and striped... and very convenient. You won't need to hide it away in the back of your closet and it's got handles, so you can take it to the laundry room with you.\n\nJute Laundry Basket, $39.99, H&M\n\nPlease do something with those drab walls that doesn't involve taping a bunch of best-selling college posters to it. This tapestry is an excellent option for covering up some of that empty space. Plus it's got tassels and fringe, which add texture galore!\n\nMoon Phase Textured Tapestry, $49, Urban Outfitters\n\nAdd some additional seating with this very on-trend banana fibre stool. It's boho for sure, but it also happens to be the perfect place for those clothes that are not quite clean enough to put back in your closet but not quite ready for the hamper. I'm not wrong.\n\nALSEDA Stool, $49.99, Ikea\n\nBright and textural\n\n(Source, left: bedbathandbeyond.ca; right: pbteen.com)\n\nFor this look, channel bright, fresh and clean with lots of white. We love these luxe looks from Bed Bath and Beyond (left) and PB Teen (right). A palette like this will add a calm vibe to your space and maybe even make a tiny dorm feel a little more spacious. To keep it from being boring, add in plenty of texture with ruched bedding, lanterns and faux fur accents. And as you can see with the Bed Bath and Beyond pic, it's an opportune palette to mix in your favourite metallics for a bit of glam.\n\nAs seen in our inspo pic, this textural beauty is designed to keep you warm and brighten up your new space. It's also organic and certified to be free from over 300 harmful substances \u2014 and 100% machine-washable.\n\nOrganic Ruched Diamond Duvet + Sham, $20.04-$105.63, PB Teen\n\nA budget-friendly fave, these paper lanterns will cast such a pretty glow on your new space. We love the layered look, like in this idea from Ikea pictured above. And if you're not allowed to put holes in your walls or ceiling, Command hooks will be your new BFFs.\n\nREGOLIT Pendant Lamp Shade, $5, and HEMMA Cord Set, $9.99, Ikea\n\nAdd in texture and make things super cozy with an extremely well-priced sheepskin rug. Fun fact from their site: \"wool is soil-repellent and durable.\" Sounds perfect for a dorm.\n\nRENS Sheepskin Rug, $39.99, Ikea\n\nAccents are truly key with a look like this. If you've got the space, consider investing in what is perhaps the coziest chair we've ever seen \u2014 maybe it'll make that reading list seem a little more manageable.\n\nButterfly Chair, $38.88, Walmart\n\nPlease don't be afraid to mix your metals! You can absolutely have gold and silver accents. And lucky for you, this very chic ottoman is not only pretty, it functions as extra seating.\n\nFaux Leather Silver Pouf, $120, Baba Souk\n\nAs seen in our inspo pic, this photo board is a step up from the traditional cork board. Plus, it's an easy way to incorporate gold into your space.\n\nUmbra Zig Zag Photo Collage Display in Gold, $26.99, Bed Bath & Beyond\n\nPlants, please\n\n(Source, left: urbanoutfitters.com; right: society6.com)\n\nWe're here to tell you that millennial pink and the plants-on-every-surface aesthetic aren't going anywhere. They also happen to look beautiful together. For inspiration, we're looking to the ivy covered walls and all-pink-everything in this shot from Urban Outfitters, along with the plenty of plants seen in this pic from Society6. If your dorm has low light, or your not looking for a commitment right now, opt for faux foliage or plant patterns over actual plants.\n\nCover your walls with a tapestry! It's available in three different sizes, and when it's time to move out of your dorm, it's easy to fold up and pack away. You can use it as a picnic blanket, because it's durable enough to be machine-washed.\n\nTerrarium Tapestry by Beth Hoeckel, about $59 CAD, Society6\n\nPlease ignore the crib in this image and focus on those pretty, matte leaves. Urban Walls is a Canadian company making it easy to achieve a dorm room oasis. These palm leaf decals are also made to be easily removable without causing wall damage (very important!) and you get eleven branches per pack.\n\nPalm Branch Wall Decals, $85.34, UW Decals\n\nPulled straight from our inspo pic, this pack of five faux vines are a wonderful addition to your new room. Leafy and lush, they can be strung just about anywhere \u2014 no watering required.\n\nDecorative Vines Set, $20, Urban Outfitters\n\nIf you do opt for live plants, these mini pots are amazing finds. They're a great home for succulents and cacti and the gold or matte black finish will work so well with the rest of your decor.\n\nSmall Metal Plant Pot, $6.99, H&M\n\nChannel plants and hues of pink with another pretty print from Juniper Print Shop. And since you can print it in any size you want, we love the idea of taking it to your local print house and printing it on vinyl for an oversized wall treatment.\n\nPom Poms Print, from about $26, Juniper Print Shop\n\nPick up this pretty pink sheet set in your pursuit of plenty of millennial pink. Pink bedding is not hard to find these days, but these sheets of sustainably-grown cotton are so well-priced, they made our list.\n\nDVALA Sheet Set, $24.99, Ikea", "description": "New accents to make your temp space cozy, cheerful and a lot more like home.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4815097.1567612878!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dorm-decor-a-jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-07"}
