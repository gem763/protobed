USA TODAY\n\nA comedian called out Harvey Weinstein during a \"tense\" stand-up show in New York after learning the disgraced film producer was at the comedy event.\n\nWeinstein, who faces sex-crime charges and lawsuits stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct, was at Manhattan's Downtime Bar Wednesday night to watch Actor's Hour, according to photos and videos taken by a fellow attendee.\n\nStand-up comic Kelly Bachman addressed the \"elephant in the room\" during her set.\n\n\"I'm feeling a little tense \u2026 anybody else?\" said Bachman, who posted footage of her stand-up performance on social media. \"I'm a comic and it's our job to name the elephant in the room. Do we know what that is? Yeah \u2026 it's a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will.\"\n\nMore: Rose McGowan sues Harvey Weinstein, claiming 'diabolical' intimidation plot\n\nShe continued, \"I didn't know that we have to bring our own mace and rape whistles to Actor's Hour,\" which is described as an exclusive speak-easy \"dedicated to artists.\"\n\nBachman was instantly booed for her remark by several audience members. One told the comedian to \"shut up.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up? This kills at group therapy for rape survivors,\" she said in response. \"They love it.\"\n\nBachman didn't stop there. She added, \"I have been raped, surprisingly by no one in this room. I never got to confront those guys, so just a general (expletive) you to whoever.\"\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed News, Weinstein's rep, Juda Engelmayer, said: \"I would just point out that accusations are not convictions, and due process is still the foundation of each and every one of our civil rights in this country.\" (Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.)\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Weinstein's rep for comment.\n\nMore: Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says he's a 'sinner,' not a rapist\n\nHarvey Weinstein, center, leaves New York Supreme Court in New York on Dec. 20, 2018. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)\n\nAn event patron, Zoe Stuckless, described being kicked out after confronting Weinstein, describing the encounter on Facebook as \"one of the most surreal nights of my life.\"\n\nStuckless shared a video that showed Weinstein silently sitting in a booth surrounded by an entourage as Stuckless yelled at him.\n\n\"Nobody\u2019s going to say anything?\" Stuckless said. \"I\u2019ll get out of here, that\u2019s fine, I am happy to leave. But nobody\u2019s going to say anything. I am going to stand four feet from a (expletive) rapist and nobody\u2019s going to say anything?\"\n\nStuckless said Weinstein \"wasn\u2019t hiding. He came to watch young artists be vulnerable on stage.\"\n\nStuckless continued: \"In some ways tonight was a horrible, painful reminder of the power a man like Weinstein holds even now. It was a reminder that even in this time of relative awareness it is hypnotically easy to be pulled into a culture of silence.\"\n\nDowntime Bar appeared to refer to Stuckless as a \"heckler\" in a statement posted to Facebook Thursday.\n\n\"We want to address some concerns about a recent incident at Downtime. A company called Actors Hour rented our bar for a private event, with a guest list all their own. Shortly into the evening, one guest began heckling another, causing a disturbance to everyone in attendance. After several requests to stop were ignored, we kindly asked the heckler to leave.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"Please know that our goal at Downtime is to create an environment where everyone feels welcome. We respect the privacy of our patrons and event partners, and want to ensure that all guests are treated equally, with the same service and respect. In keeping with this goal, we made a decision that would allow the evening to continue as planned.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Downtime Bar for comment.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/25/harvey-weinstein-comedian-kelly-bachman-calls-out-disgraced-mogul/4093147002/", "description": "A comic called out Harvey Weinstein during a \"tense\" stand-up show at a New York bar after learning the disgraced film producer was in attendance.", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published A.M.
