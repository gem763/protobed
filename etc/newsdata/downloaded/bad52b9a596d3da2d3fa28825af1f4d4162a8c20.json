Suspended from a steel platform, layers of gold-plated copper conductors and intricately threaded pipes are arranged. It is only the small microchip, buried towards the bottom of it all, that betrays the fact that this is a computer.\n\nThe quantum computer - named Sycamore - at Google\u2019s laboratory in Santa Barbara is like no computer most of us are used to. Nor does it bear any resemblance to today\u2019s high-powered supercomputers, which are used to predict weather patterns and run artificial intelligence programs. But the company claims that it can do something no...", "description": "At first sight, the future of computing looks more like an movie villain's superweapon than the history-making machine Google claims.", "authors": ["James Titcomb", "Robin Pagnamenta", "Harry De Quetteville"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/24/2019_SB_Google_0264-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqD38Ygbk4c6nCR8LT0DmIKo3mlXqw5ig802QpMXzG1OY.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
