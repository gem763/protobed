Natural progression, (I\u2019m) delighted for him. He\u2019s a proud lad and proud to get a call up.\n\n\u201cHe can score at international level. I don\u2019t want to put too much pressure on his shoulders, I\u2019m sure he has those attributes and the attitude to take that challenge of being a goal scorer for England.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s competition there and when he steps into that squad he\u2019ll see that there\u2019s great strikers there already, so it\u2019s a challenge for Tammy.\u201d\n\nChelsea centre back Fikayo Tomori received his first call up to the England team and Lampard said he was \u2018delighted\u2019 for the 21-year-old who has flown under the radar.\n\n\u201cMason (Mount) and Tammy have taken headlines, but Tomori\u2026 to see him play the full season last year (at Derby County) and then to come here\u2026 Some people would have easily doubted him,\u201d Lampard added.\n\n\u201cAnother natural progression and I am really pleased, he deserves it. He has shown great qualities and he has been a dream to work with.\n\n\u201cGetting into the team is the next challenge, then it will be about staying in the team. (England boss) Gareth (Southgate) has shown trust, now it is in Fikayo\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nLampard said he expected a \u201ctough match\u201d against Ralph Hasenhuettl\u2019s Southampton, who sit four points behind Chelsea in the standings.\n\nLampard said he would take a late call on N\u2019Golo Kante\u2019s participation after the midfielder, who has struggled with a hamstring injury this season, played 90 minutes in Wednesday\u2019s 2-1 Champions League win at Lille.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori\u2019s call ups to the England national team for this months\u2019 Euro 2020 qualifiers are a \u201cnatural progression\u201d after their performances for Chelsea this season, manager Frank Lampard said on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Foot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
