Shauntai Gracia for not testing the wife for gunfire residue at the time.\n\nThe detectives were directed by Lieutenant Denis P. Walsh, who retired in 2016 as he faced being fired for helping to keep ex-Mayor Daley's nephew from being charged in another killing.\n\nDina Markham died from a Xanax and alcohol overdose in May 2017, and on Wednesday the City of Chicago's Inspector General noted several instances that may have messed up a fair investigation of the case.\n\nTwo cops involved in the investigation of Sgt. Donald Markham's (left) shooting death in 2015 were suspended for five days apiece after a report said they failed to follow 'appropriate leads'\n\nNew report noted that people at a funeral home had heard 'comments suggesting [Dina Markham] was in the room when [her husband] was shot'. However she had claimed she was outside the house in Old Norwood Park on the Northwest Side, and she nor their children heard a gunshot\n\nThe Chicago Sun Times reported that none of the officers were named in the Inspector General's write-up but they identified the subjects.\n\nHe said Walsh ordered the removal of his blood-soaked mattress 'without authorization' from a medical examiner.\n\nFerguson criticized Walsh for the ultimate ruling that Donald's death suicide without 'any investigative avenues which might have led to different conclusions'.\n\nHis wife Officer Dina Markham said she found him dead in bed but she wasn't tested for gunfire residue at the time. She died from an overdose in 2017\n\nHe said cops failed to follow 'appropriate leads'.\n\n'The lieutenant, sergeant and detective violated CPD rules by conducting an incompetent and incomplete investigation . . . neither competent nor complete,' Ferguson determined.\n\nPolice reports from the time of the 51-year-old's death showed the narcotics officer had shot himself in the head after drunkenly arguing with his wife at a bar and later at their home.\n\nDina had told police she was initially locked out of the house and found her husband dead in their bed when one of their children let her into the home.\n\nPolice reports indicate Dina then called 911.\n\nThe pair had earlier been out drinking with Detective Rob Voight and Voight\u2019s wife. Voight later told the FBI he started an affair with Dina after Donald's death.\n\nGracia - who worked with Dina in the Area North Division - assigned Donald's case to Spain and the cops drove together to the family home after the incident.\n\nThe new report states there was no evidence Officers Spain and Gracia 'probed the questionable assertion' that none of the three sons question in front of their mother heard Donald's .380-caliber, Glock semi-automatic pistol being fired.\n\nDonald's siblings have claimed that Dina has in the past threatened to kill her husband and make it look like suicide. The siblings were not interviewed by investigators, Ferguson said.\n\nThe new report mentioned that Dina's cell phone found in her dead husband's pocket at Cook County morgue was returned to her after she refused to allow others access to the contents which 'may have had evidentiary value'\n\nIn 2017 the FBI and Cook County Police released audio tapes of the wife's 911 call as it was claimed Dina could have murdered her husband. But the FBI had dropped the probe after Dina was found dead in her bathtub\n\nFerguson wrote that neighbors who heard the couple arguing in the driveway before the shooting were not interviewed. He added that a responding firefighter had claimed the gun that supposedly killed Donald was not the one he witnessed at the crime scene.\n\n'The investigative team neither challenged nor attempted to verify the account given by [Markham's] spouse, also a CPD member . . . despite their marriage having been marked by credit card debt, allegations of infidelity and volatile arguments.\n\n'Because of the bare, uncorroborated, assertion of the spouse to have not been in the house when [Markham] was shot, the investigative team did not test the spouse for gunshot residue and may have even given the spouse express permission to wash [her] hands.'\n\nThe new report mentioned that Dina's cell phone found in her dead husband's pocket at Cook County morgue was returned to her after she refused to allow others access to the contents which 'may have had evidentiary value'.\n\nFerguson noted in his report that people at a funeral home had heard 'comments suggesting [she] was in the room when [her husband] was shot'.\n\nIn 2017 the FBI and Cook County Police released audio tapes of the wife's 911 call as it was claimed Dina could have murdered her husband. But the FBI had dropped the probe after Dina was found dead in her bathtub.\n\nA police spokesperson noted that at the time of the FBI's probe the agency had not filed charges or enforced sanctions against the detectives who were suspended this week for five days, 'based on case law from other similar rule violations'.\n\nThose officers had been under the direction of Walsh, who had earlier pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors as he faced a criminal sexual misconduct charge in Michigan and was ultimately promoted to lieutenant.\n\nWalsh left in February 2016 as he faced firing when accused of falsifying evidence in the 2004 case of Mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s nephew Richard J. 'R.J.' Vanecko charged with killing David Koschman.", "description": "Illinois Detective Brian Spain and Sgt.
