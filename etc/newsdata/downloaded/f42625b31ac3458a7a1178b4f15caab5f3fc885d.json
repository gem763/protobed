(Photo by Tim Warner/Getty Images)\n\nTexas tackle Samuel Cosmi lived every offensive lineman\u2019s dream in the fourth quarter against West Virginia on Saturday.\n\nWith his team leading 28-17 and deep in WVU territory, Cosmi was on the receiving end of an awesome play. Texas, ranked No. 11 in the country, sent a man in motion, snapped the ball and Texas QB Sam Ehlinger followed the motioning receiver to the right. Cosmi, lined up at left tackle, stayed behind and Ehlinger lobbed a backwards pass to Cosmi about nine yards behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe big man did the rest, lumbering about 21 yards for a Texas touchdown.\n\nBIG MAN TD LET'S GET WEIRD MORGANTOWN pic.twitter.com/iaaF8wcNmL \u2014 Longhorn Network (@LonghornNetwork) October 5, 2019\n\nImagine having to tackle Cosmi, who is listed at 6-foot-7 and 300 pounds, in the open field. Yikes.\n\n(via ESPN)\n\nAnd since Ehlinger\u2019s toss was a lateral, Cosmi\u2019s touchdown officially goes in the books as a 12-yard run. Either way, he\u2019ll take it.\n\nCosmi had to stay on the field for the extra point. After that kick sailed through the uprights, Cosmi was excitedly greeted on the sideline by Texas head coach Tom Herman, as well as a swarm of his teammates.\n\n(via ESPN)\n\nThe touchdown, which came on the heels of a fourth interception thrown by West Virginia QB Austin Kendall, gave Texas a 35-17 lead with 10:31 to play.\n\nTexas would go on to win 42-31 to improve to 4-1 on the year. WVU dropped to 3-2 with the loss.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Texas tackle Samuel Cosmi lived every offensive lineman\u2019s dream against West Virginia on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uuzfKi8ETqw.wmZxKD5PNg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3siSNJpEGBtuv2KlDouYyg--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/71da4640-e7c3-11e9-bfec-0f6d74d54d26", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
