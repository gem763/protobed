It was Brady\u2019s 523rd TD pass. Peyton Manning is first with 539. \u2026 Green Bay\u2019s Aaron Rodgers tied Fran Tarkenton for the ninth-most touchdown passes in NFL history with 342. Next up for Rodgers is Eli Manning, who has 362. \u2026 Kansas City coach Andy Reid won his 210th game, breaking a tie with Chuck Knoll for sixth-most in NFL history. \u2026 Atlanta\u2019s Matt Ryan passed John Elway for ninth on the league\u2019s career completion list - he has 4,143 - and broke a tie with Elway for No. 11 on the career TD passes list - he has 303. \u2026 Philip Rivers made his 209th consecutive start, tying Eli Manning for the second-longest streak in NFL history. Brett Favre started 297 straight, meaning the 37-year-old Rivers would have to play five more seasons after this one to catch him.\n\n___\n\nSTREAKS & STATS\n\nKansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes has 13 games of at least 300 yards passing, breaking Kurt Warner\u2019s mark for the most in the first 20 games of a career. \u2026 The Chiefs have scored 26 or more points in an NFL-record 24 straight regular-season games. \u2026 Denver fell to 0-6-1 all-time on the road against Green Bay. \u2026 Miami has been outscored 133-16, the largest point differential through three games in league history since 1950. \u2026 New England won its seventh straight over the New York Jets and earned its ninth consecutive regular-season win at home over its AFC East rival. \u2026 Seattle\u2019s 33-27 loss to New Orleans was its first at home in the month of September under coach Pete Carroll. The Seahawks had been 15-0 at home in September since 2010.\n\n___\n\nSTARTS\n\nWith a 21-17 victory over Cincinnati, Buffalo improved to 3-0 for the first time since 2011 and only the third time in 26 years. \u2026 Bengals rookie coach Zac Taylor, who took over after Marvin Lewis was fired this offseason, became the fifth of Cincinnati\u2019s 10 coaches to open his first season 0-3, and third in a row. The worst start by a first-year Bengals coach was Sam Wyche, who lost his first five in 1984. \u2026 The New York Jets are off to their first 0-3 start since 2003. \u2026 Miami is 0-3 for the first time since losing its first seven in 2011. \u2026 Dallas is 3-0 for the first time since 2008.\n\n___\n\nTURNING IT AROUND\n\nAfter missing the playoffs last season, Buffalo (3-0), Detroit (2-0-1), Green Bay (3-0) and San Francisco (3-0) are all off to undefeated starts. It marks the fourth time since 1990 - when the current playoff format began - that at least four teams have started the season without a loss in their first three games after missing the postseason the previous year. It also happened in the 2013, 2003 and 2002 seasons.\n\n___\n\nDOMINANT D\n\nWith a 30-14 victory over the New York Jets, the New England Patriots became the first team in the Super Bowl era to not allow a rushing or passing touchdown in their first three games. The Patriots are also the first team to hold opponents scoreless in the first half of five consecutive games, including the postseason, the longest such streak in the Super Bowl era.\n\n___\n\nMR. JONES\n\nRookie quarterback Daniel Jones threw for 336 yards and two touchdowns and also ran for two TDs, including the go-ahead score with 1:16 remaining as the New York Giants rallied from an 18-point halftime deficit to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 32-31. Jones, making his first NFL start in place of benched two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, also led the Giants with 28 yards rushing on four attempts. He is the first rookie with at least 300 passing yards, two passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns in a single game since 1970.\n\n___\n\nPASSING PAT\n\nKansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes threw for 374 yards with three touchdowns and zero interceptions for a 132.0 rating in the Chiefs\u2019 33-28 win over Baltimore. Through 20 NFL games, Mahomes has the highest marks in yards passing (6,576), TD passes (60) and passer rating (115.3) in NFL history. His 13 games of at least 300 yards top Kurt Warner\u2019s previous mark of 12 through a player\u2019s first 20 games. Mahomes is also the first player with at least 350 yards passing, three touchdown passes and no interceptions in three consecutive games in NFL history.\n\n___\n\nYOUNG GUNS\n\nKyle Allen threw for 261 yards and four touchdowns in place of the injured Cam Newton, helping the Carolina Panthers beat the Arizona Cardinals 38-20. The 23-year-old Allen was outstanding in his second career start, making several big throws, finishing 19 of 26, including two touchdowns to Greg Olsen and one each to Curtis Samuel and DJ Moore. He outplayed Arizona\u2019s Kyler Murray, who was his former college teammate at Texas A&M.; Murray was 30 of 43 for 173 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. He also ran for 69 yards. But Murray was also sacked eight times.\n\n___\n\nTOUCHDOWN TEDDY\n\nTeddy Bridgewater threw two touchdown passes in his first start in place of Drew Brees, leading New Orleans past the Seattle Seahawks 33-27. Bridgewater threw a 29-yard touchdown to Alvin Kamara late in the first half on a screen pass where the talented running back bounced off several tacklers on his way to the end zone. He added a 1-yard TD toss to Michael Thomas on fourth-and-goal on the first possession of the second half, a drive kept alive by an illegal formation penalty against Seattle on a missed field goal attempt. It was Bridgewater\u2019s first win as a starting quarterback since Jan. 3, 2016, the final week of the 2015 season.\n\n___\n\nSHAQ ATTAQ\n\nTampa Bay linebacker Shaquil Barrett had four sacks in the Buccaneers\u2019 32-31 loss to the New York Giants. He has eight sacks in three games, tying the Jets\u2019 Mark Gastineau (1984) for the most in the first three games of a season since 1982 - when sacks became an official sack.\n\n___\n\nIMMEDIATE IMPACT\n\nPittsburgh safety Minkah Fitzpatrick intercepted a pass in the first quarter of the Steelers\u2019 24-20 loss at San Francisco and forced a fumble by Raheem Mostert in the red zone in the second quarter that Devin Bush recovered. Fitzpatrick, acquired from Miami this past week in a deal that sent a first-round pick to the Dolphins, became the first Steelers player with an interception and forced fumble in the opening half since James Harrison did it against the Chargers on Nov. 16, 2008.\n\n___\n\nCOOK-ING WITH GAS\n\nMinnesota\u2019s Dalvin Cook ran for 110 yards and a touchdown in the Vikings\u2019 34-14 win over Oakland, becoming the fifth player in NFL history with at least 110 yards rushing and a TD run in each of his team\u2019s first three games. Cook joins Jim Brown (1958), O.J. Simpson (1975), Emmitt Smith (1995) and Curtis Martin (2004).\n\n___\n\nSIDELINED\n\nSuper Bowl MVP Julian Edelman left the Patriots\u2019 win against the Jets with a chest injury. He caught a pass, fell on his right side and was sandwiched by Harvey Langi and Henry Anderson. Edelman got up holding his rib area. \u2026 Giants running back Saquon Barkley left his team\u2019s 32-31 win over Tampa Bay with a right ankle injury late in the first half. He was seen on crutches and with a boot on the ankle afterward. \u2026 Miami wide receiver Allen Hurns had to be taken off the field after a jarring play at Dallas, just as he did in the playoffs last season when he played for the Cowboys. Hurns stayed down for a couple of minutes after a huge hit from Dallas safety Jeff Heath that resulted in an incompletion. He was ruled out with a concussion. \u2026 Atlanta safety Keanu Neal was carted off the field late in the first half at Indianapolis with an Achilles tendon injury. He missed last season after tearing an ACL in the season opener. \u2026 Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton aggravated a quadriceps injury. \u2026 Chiefs running back LeSean McCoy aggravated his sore ankle on his touchdown catch in the fourth quarter.\n\n___\n\nSPEAKING\n\n\u201cI took basically one shot. I hit the ground one time. So, I\u2019m ecstatic. I\u2019ve been at this for a long time. To go home with my body feeling this good is a credit to the offensive line, for sure.\u201d - Green Bay\u2019s Aaron Rodgers, who wasn\u2019t sacked and was barely touched by Denver\u2019s defense in the Packers\u2019 27-16 victory.\n\n___\n\n\u201cI was feeling like everyone was open and I was throwing it to people in my color jersey who were open. It was just one of those days.\u201d - Indianapolis quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who threw for 310 yards and two TDs in Indianapolis\u2019 27-24 win over Atlanta\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "SCOREBOARD", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/ravens_chiefs_football_02524_c0-126-2999-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?972468fa1cc1d90447d941560d1fe998dd054312", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
