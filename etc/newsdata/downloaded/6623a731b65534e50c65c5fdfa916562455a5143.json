Many of the applications come from Long Island developers or homeowners making renovations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe utility is refusing to process the requests for new gas hookups unless the state approves a controversial pipeline project by Williams, arguing that the natural gas line is necessary to address supply constraints. Environmentalists, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo himself, question whether such constraints actually exist.\n\nAlthough the moratorium affects Long Island, most of the region's state senators are declining to take an unequivocal public stance on the issue. County executives in both Nassau and Suffolk have endorsed the pipeline.\n\nLong Island Senate races are among the most competitive in the state, and the region\u2019s politics may make it difficult to take a firm position. The project is opposed by most environmental groups and backed by the Long Island Association, an influential business group, and politically powerful labor unions including the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York.\n\n\u201cLong Island is well known for its green politicians \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 and they know it can be a very complicated and dangerous landscape,\u201d said Larry Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University on Long Island.\n\nThe Democratic senators who played a key role in supporting the passage of the state\u2019s climate bill should take a stand against the pipeline, said Ryan Madden of the Long Island Progressive Coalition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a turning point and we can\u2019t be of two minds right now,\u201d Madden said. \u201cWe have to stop the bad and build the new \u2026 We can\u2019t pass monumental climate legislation only to go on locking ourselves into further emissions. I\u2019d encourage them to take whatever perceived political risk there is and own the new future that we\u2019re building that they helped usher.\u201d\n\nLong Island's Democratic state senators have been a key voting bloc on several issues since their party solidified control of the chamber this year. They opposed a measure to give driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants, were wary of legalizing marijuana and were at the center of debate over ending a religious exemption for school vaccination requirements.\n\nOn this issue, many of the senators \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 have been anything but vocal. The offices of Sens. John Brooks (D-Nassau), Kevin Thomas (D-Nassau), Anna Kaplan (D-Nassau), Monica Martinez (D-Suffolk), Jim Gaughran (D-Suffolk) and Ken LaValle (R-Suffolk) did not return repeated requests for comment or interviews on the subject. The office of Sen. Todd Kaminsky, chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee, did respond but declined to comment.\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesperson for Sen. Phil Boyle (R-Suffolk) said he supports the pipeline.\n\nAnother exception to the rule of silence has been Senate Minority Leader John Flanagan, who represents a portion of Suffolk County. He took a clear public stance in support of the pipeline project on WCNY\u2019s The Capitol Pressroom with Susan Arbetter last week.\n\n\u201cI blame the governor,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cThis was avoidable, this is still fixable. This is going to crush small business, it\u2019s going to kill economic development.\u201d\n\nBrooks, although his office did not respond to POLITICO\u2019s inquiries, wrote a letter in support of the pipeline in August 2019 to DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos. He cited the negative impacts of the moratorium on economic development projects.\n\n\u201cWithout the [pipeline] project. I am concerned that Long Island residents and businesses are being denied the economic and environmental benefits that would come from this project as we transition to renewable energy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThomas signed on to a statement opposing federal changes to state pipeline permitting authority that cited previous opposition to the Williams pipeline. Gaughran publicly struggled with the issue at a town hall event, according to the Syosset Advance.\n\nThe Long Island senators could be taking a wait-and-see approach as the Department of Public Service investigates whether or not the moratorium is justified. Cuomo on Tuesday said that review would not be finished for \u201cseveral weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know they want the pipeline approved and I hope they\u2019re not pressuring government by excluding a lot of customers,\u201d Cuomo told host Brian Lehrer on WNYC on Tuesday, citing cases where customers doing renovations have been unable to reconnect to gas service. \u201cWe\u2019re against the pipeline. That\u2019s our position \u2026 There\u2019s no negotiation. If they\u2019re extorting people and wrongfully turning off gas service, that\u2019s a crime.\u201d\n\nThe former president of the New York League of Conservation Voters endorsed the project, but current NYLCV president Julie Tighe, who was previously chief of staff at the state Department of Environmental Conservation, declined to comment directly on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe believe coal and oil should be replaced as soon as possible by clean renewable energy sources but natural gas can be a bridge fuel that improves air quality and public health outcomes,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis quick and orderly transition will help us ensure energy reliability, affordability, and most importantly help us to achieve our carbon reduction goals, reduce air pollution, and improve public health now.\u201d\n\nDEC's review of the project, known formally as the Williams Northeast Supply Enhancement, does not take into consideration the moratorium or gas supply issues more broadly. Its authority to review the federally permitted pipeline stems from water quality impacts, and those issues were cited in March when DEC rejected the project.\n\nCuomo\u2019s explicit opposition to the pipeline is a more aggressive stance than he\u2019s previously taken. He typically defers more to DEC\u2019s review process, which is ongoing after Williams resubmitted its application with additional information. The governor did mention that submission on WNYC.\n\nDEC said in a statement a decision would be made on or before May 17, 2020.\n\n\u201cDEC subjects all applications for environmental permits to an extensive and transparent review process that encourages public input at every step,\u201d the agency\u2019s statement said.", "description": "The region\u2019s politics may make it difficult to take a firm position.", "authors": ["Marie J.
