It was the fifth consecutive win for the Cardinals, who came back for a 9-8 victory Saturday on consecutive homers by Yadier Molina and Paul DeJong against Craig Kimbrel in the ninth.\n\nThe time, Chicago manager Joe Maddon sent a dominant Yu Darvish (6-8) back to the mound for the ninth to go for his first complete game since 2014. But the result was the same in the Cubs\u2018 fifth consecutive one-run loss.\n\nPinch hitter Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez sparked the winning rally with a leadoff triple that glanced off the glove of diving center fielder Albert Almora Jr. Dexter Fowler followed with a sacrifice fly, tying it at 2.\n\nAfter rookie Tommy Edman singled and stole second, Goldschmidt hit a grounder down the third-base line to put the Cardinals in front for good in the Cubs\u2018 rainy home finale.\n\nMiles Mikolas pitched 7 2/3 innings of two-run ball and Tyler Webb (2-1) got the last out of the eighth for the win. Andrew Miller worked the ninth for his sixth save.\n\nNicholas Castellanos hit his career-high 27th homer for Chicago (82-74), which dropped four games back of the Brewers for the second NL wild card. The Cubs finished with a 51-30 home record after losing their losing their last six games of the year at Wrigley.\n\nIt was the first four-game series sweep for St. Louis (89-67) at Chicago\u2019s famed ballpark since May 1921.\n\nCastellanos also scored the first run of the game when he scampered home on Yadier Molina\u2019s passed ball in the first. But DeJong tied it with his 29th homer, a massive drive to Waveland Avenue in the third.\n\nIt was still tied when Castellanos led off the sixth with a drive to center for his 16th homer in 49 games since he was acquired in a July 31 trade with Detroit.\n\nThe Cubs were without Kris Bryant for most of the day after the slugger sprained his right ankle trying to beat out a double play in the third. X-rays taken at the ballpark were negative.\n\nONE SWEET TUNE\n\nGary Pressy threw out a ceremonial first pitch before his 2,687th and final game as the organist at Wrigley. He also led the crowd in the singing of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d during the seventh-inning stretch.\n\nPressy is retiring after beginning his career at Wrigley in 1986.\n\nABOUT THE NUMBERS\n\nThe announced attendance was 38,606, bringing the season total at Wrigley to 3,094,865. The Cubs\u2018 attendance last year was 3,181,089, but that included a crowd of 38,450 for the Cubs\u2018 NL Central tiebreaker loss to the Brewers.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCardinals: An MRI on Kolten Wong\u2019s ailing left hamstring showed a Grade 2 strain. The infielder is hoping to return during the Cardinals\u2018 last series of the season against Chicago in St. Louis. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to give this enough time where it definitely won\u2019t hinder me going on,\u201d he said.\n\nCubs: SS Javier B\u00e1ez could return to the field Tuesday at Pittsburgh for the first time since he broke his left thumb. He struck out as a pinch hitter Saturday in his first plate appearance since the injury. \u201cThe biggest thing is just closing his glove on defense,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cSo if he\u2019s able to do that and he\u2019s making great progress you may see him.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (13-9, 3.83 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game series at Arizona on Monday night. Wainwright is 4-0 in September, allowing one earned run in 27 innings. LHP Alex Young (7-4, 3.27 ERA) pitches for the Diamondbacks.\n\nCubs: Following an off day, Chicago begins a three-game set at Pittsburgh on Tuesday night. The team hasn\u2019t announced its starting pitchers for the series. RHP Mitch Keller (1-5, 7.74 ERA) pitches for the Pirates in the opener.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Paul Goldschmidt and the St. Louis Cardinals celebrated the franchise's first postseason berth in four years with a champagne toast in the visitor's clubhouse.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jay Cohen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/cardinals_cubs_baseball_73114_c0-135-3226-2015_s1770x1032.jpg?9f3452550ba753df1246bc0b236b17983acd7d9f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
