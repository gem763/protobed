At first glance, things couldn\u2019t be more different: the European Central Bank has just boosted stimulus measures and investors aren\u2019t expecting a U.S. recession until at least next year.\n\nBut this week\u2019s release of disappointing economic data in France and Germany came as a sharp and unpleasant wake-up call for the fans of equities that have returned a whopping 19% this year. The seriousness of the slowdown makes investors doubt the potency of the ECB measures without the support of individual nations\u2019 fiscal stimulus. An escalation in the U.K. political crisis and the start of an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump aren\u2019t helping sentiment either.\n\n\u201cOur concerns have increased while euro-zone stocks have outperformed -- not an attractive mix,\u201d said Lars Kreckel, global equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management, which is underweight euro-zone equities versus the U.S. \u201cRecession risk remains uncomfortably high for the euro zone.\u201d\n\nThe impact from continuing trade tensions and a global slowdown are taking their toll on Europe. Business expectations in Germany fell to the lowest in a decade this month and the slump in manufacturing pushed the region\u2019s largest economy closer to recession.\n\nFund managers are echoing the concerns of the departing ECB President Mario Draghi that governments need to join the central bank\u2019s measures in supporting the economy. According to the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) survey, an expansion in German public spending outranks even a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve in its importance to fueling gains in risk assets.\n\nSo far, there\u2019s little sign of imminent action, with Chancellor Angela Merkel saying that the problem isn\u2019t a shortage of money for investment. This could break the winning streak for the , says Edward Park of Brooks Macdonald Asset Management.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest risks to European equities is that the weak manufacturing data is not enough to encourage a fiscal response from Germany,\u201d said Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald, which is underweight European stocks. \u201cIf this is the case and markets fear a further downturn in business activity, the fourth quarter could be challenging for European risk assets.\u201d\n\nIronically enough, the market\u2019s already pessimistic stance on European stocks could serve as a cushion to possible end-of-the-year downside. Funds focused on the region\u2019s equities have lost $97 billion in outflows this year alone and, based on the Bank of America (NYSE: ) survey, are the least popular assets globally. Plus, strategist cuts to European earnings growth expectations have exceeded upgrades almost every month of this year.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect a repeat of a spectacular drawdown because earnings expectations have come down substantially over the last 12 months, i.e. quite a bit of bad news is discounted,\u201d said Themis Themistocleous, head of the European Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, which is underweight euro-zone equities. \u201cNevertheless, we expect European stocks to struggle in the fourth quarter amid ongoing earnings downgrades and slowing economic growth.\u201d\n\nThe Index fell 12% in the final quarter of 2018, the worst decline since 2011, and spent most of this year making up for this dramatic loss. It is now enjoying the best gain for the first nine months of the year since 2009. Valuations in 2019 have rebounded from December lows, but remain below historical averages.\n\nEquities were up 0.8% on Thursday after Trump, facing an impeachment inquiry, said a trade agreement with China is getting \u201ccloser and closer\u201d and there\u2019s a \u201cgood chance\u201d a deal can be reached.\n\nAs they approach the fourth quarter, fund managers are confronted by the dilemma of risking losing this year\u2019s stellar returns or missing out on further gains if they sell too early. Even such devoted fans of equities as Ken Adams of Aberdeen Standard Investments say the outlook is particularly uncertain at the moment.\n\n\u201cOur overall stance is positive, but only modestly so,\u201d said Adams, the global head of multi-asset strategy at Aberdeen. \u201cMy advice over the next three months is to maintain some dry powder in case something unexpected happens. That\u2019s certainly worthwhile in this environment because the crystal ball is especially clouded at the moment.\u201d\n\n(Updates with today\u2019s market move in the third-to-last paragraph.)", "description": "Terror of $2 Trillion Loss Makes Stock Traders Fear Year-End", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc82905fe0c34cf5b11a98622a5b12284.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
