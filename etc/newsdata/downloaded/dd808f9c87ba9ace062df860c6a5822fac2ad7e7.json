Now, the iconic children\u2019s television show having a muppet named Karli teach them about a more difficult subject: the opioid crisis.\n\nA new muppet named Karli, whose mother is a recovering addict, appears in an online-only segment to teach younger audiences about how to cope with parental addiction as a part of Sesame Street in Communities, an initiative that partners with direct-service organizations that serve vulnerable children and families, including non-profits and social work organizations.\n\nIn the online series, Elmo and other muppets learn about addiction, \u201ca sickness \u2014 but not the kind you catch like a cold,\u201d and how to help their friend Karli cope with her mother getting treatment for her \u201cgrown-up problem.\u201d The educational programming uses language that makes the complex issue easy to understand for its young audience. In addition to explaining what an addiction is and what a parent may be going through, the show also tackles the blame children feel when their parents have an addiction.\n\n\u201cI used to think a lot of things were my fault, especially my mom\u2019s problem,\u201d Karli confides in Elmo. \u201cBut she told me no, it was a grown-up problem and it wasn\u2019t because of anything I did. And she said that she loves me no matter what.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series tackling addiction later introduces Karli\u2019s human friend, Salia, whose \u201cmom and dad have the same problem as my mom: addiction.\u201d\n\nKarli adds, \u201cWhen my mom was having a hard time, I had lots of big feelings. I felt like I was the only one. Now, I met other kids like Salia and we can talk about it together.\u201d\n\nIn the live-action film, Salia, 10, explains that addiction is \u201cgetting attracted to something so you keep doing it over and over again. It makes people feel like they need drugs and alcohol to feel OK.\u201d She goes on to talk about her own parents\u2019 addiction and using coping mechanisms including journaling, drawing and meditation \u2014 something she and her mother would do together while she was undergoing treatment.\n\n\u201cIt feels good to help other children who went through what I went through,\u201d Salia says in the online segment. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Mom and Dad for asking for help and not using drugs and alcohol anymore.\u201d\n\nThe iconic children\u2019s educational television show isn\u2019t known to shy away from difficult topics \u2014 it\u2019s tackled death, incarceration, homelessness, foster care and more though its programming and Sesame Street in Communities \u2014 and parental addiction is no different.\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, more than 130 people in the United States die every day from an opioid overdoes. As legislators on the state and federal level deal with the aftermath of the opioid crisis and focus on getting treatment for those struggling with addiction, Sesame Street aims to help the 5.7 million children nationwide under the age of 11 who have parents dealing with substance abuse, according to creators.\n\n\u201cWe were hearing more and more \u2014 I\u201dm sure because of the growing crisis with addiction \u2014 there was such a need to help young children who were dealing with family members that were struggling with addiction,\u201d Sherrie Westin, Sesame Workshop\u2019s president of social impact and philanthropy, tells Yahoo Lifestyle, who discovered this need through their Sesame Street in Communities partners.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where Sesame Street says what can we do to help children cope with those issues, overcome these issues and build resilience. That\u2019s why we chose to address this issue.\u201d\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children dealing with the trauma of parental addiction can \u201cface social, emotional, physical and mental health challenges that last into adulthood,\u201d which can lead to school failure, substance abuse of their own and health conditions like obesity and heart disease. In addition to the trauma of witnessing a guardian grapple with substance abuse, one in three children are placed in foster care because of parental addiction.\n\n\u201cOpioid addiction can make it difficult for parents to provide children with what they need, including not just safe housing and food but supportive and loving relationships. And too often, it can deprive children of their families, a reality evidenced by rising foster care placements,\u201d says Scott D.
