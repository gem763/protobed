I understand everything about it and exactly what the consequences will be \u2013 because I have followed the instructions on the dull billboard. Get Ready for Brexit! And I have been on a government website. It\u2019s now all totally clear.\u201d\n\nPrecisely no one is saying this \u2013 because none of it makes sense. An expensive ad campaign said to cost \u00a3100m is mystifying in its utter uselessness. The government website is as helpful as Chris Grayling with a head cold. All I can work out is that it will now be immensely complicated if I want to take my cat to Dublin. I don\u2019t, actually. I was just trying to think of a scenario in which any information at all is available, as it basically asks if you will travel anywhere ever after 31 October. My only answer to this is \u201chopefully\u201d.\n\nThere are also seminars in which you can get more information about a no-deal Brexit. I imagine this to be some sort of Arthur Janov Primal Scream set up. Sorry, I am washing my hair every night for the transition period \u2013 so that\u2019s 15 years gone.\n\nThis is all billed as a public information campaign but it is devoid of information and is simply publicly-funded government propaganda. How easily we have slipped into a world where our government consistently breaks every rule in front of us: there is supposed to be a ministerial code governing taxpayer-funded communications.\n\nCivil servants cannot be happy that this campaign is publicly funded. All of this chipping away at the processes designed to ensure fairness is the modus operandi of this government, which is desperately flouting not just the law, but every idea of decency. Voter suppression anyone? Why, given the Benn act, are these ads still running? Get ready for more laws to be broken ...\n\n\u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist", "description": "This hugely expensive campaign is simply publicly funded propaganda.
