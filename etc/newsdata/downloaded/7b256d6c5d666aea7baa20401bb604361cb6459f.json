It was a perfect call, a perfect call. What wasn\u2019t perfect is the horrible thing that Joe Biden said. And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son. I mean, give me a break. He\u2019s already said he spoke to his son. And now he said yesterday very firmly. Who wouldn\u2019t speak to your son? Of course you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son. But, more importantly, what he said about the billions of dollars that he wouldn\u2019t give them unless they fired the prosecutor, and then he bragged about how they fired the prosecutor, and then they got the money.\u201d\n\n\u2014President Trump, speaking to reporters, Sept. 22, 2019\n\n\u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d\n\n\u2014Former vice president Joe Biden, speaking to reporters, Sept. 21\n\n\u201cSomebody ought to look into Joe Biden\u2019s statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he\u2019s not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that.\u201d\n\n\u2014Trump, remarks to reporters, Sept. 20\n\nPresident Trump is under fire for having repeatedly raised Biden, a possible 2020 presidential opponent, in a July conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president at a time when the struggling nation expected to receive military aid for its nascent war against Russia on its eastern border. (The aid eventually arrived after demands from Congress.) The same conversation appears to figure in a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community but the details are not entirely clear because the administration has blocked the sharing of information about the complaint with Congress despite apparent requirements under the law.\n\nThis is one of those vast and complex stories that consume Washington but frequently confuse ordinary Americans. The Trump White House appears to be counting on that confusion to offer a fog of claims and allegations to make it appear as if Biden had done something wrong.\n\nOn top of that, Trump is arguing that because Biden said he withheld aid from Ukraine in the name of battling corruption, there\u2019s nothing wrong with Trump withholding aid from the same country in the name of fighting corruption (ie, Biden was involved in supposedly corrupt dealings and should be investigated).\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nBut there is no equivalency here: We fact-checked these allegations in May and found they did not add up. In fact, Biden\u2019s case has gotten stronger with time.\n\nTrump has claimed that Biden in 2016 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating a Ukrainian gas producer, Burisma Holdings, that had added Biden\u2019s son Hunter to its board. But it turns out the investigation had already been shelved when Biden acted and may have even involved a side company, not Burisma. The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure and \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,\u201d said Anders \u00c5slund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms.\n\nMoreover, Yuri Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.\n\nIn an effort to help readers keep the allegations straight, let\u2019s dissect the president\u2019s latest statements.\n\nBiden lied about talking to his son\n\nBiden told reporters he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings.\n\nTrump labeled that a lie. \u201cWho wouldn't speak to your son?\u201d asked Trump, who has always maintained he never spoke to his son Don about the Trump Tower meeting with Russian operatives. \u201cOf course you spoke to your son.\u201d\n\nIn July, in a profile of Hunter Biden in the New Yorker, Hunter described one brief exchange with his father on the issue.\n\nIn December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter\u2019s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration\u2019s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: \u201cDad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIs that a substantive discussion or not? We will leave it to readers to decide, but it\u2019s a thin reed on which to hang the label of \u201clie.\u201d\n\nBiden was \u2018disgraceful\u2019 when he bragged about holding back the funds\n\nTrump is referring to a 2018 appearance by Biden before the Council on Foreign Relations. Here\u2019s what Biden said:\n\n\u201cI remember going over [to Ukraine in March 2016], convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees. \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from [then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko] and from [then-Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor [Shokin]. And they didn\u2019t\u2026They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, \u2026 we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, \u2018call him.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars.\u2019 \u2026 I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nBiden is certainly being self-congratulatory here. But, as noted, Biden\u2019s action was coordinated with other major players in the region and celebrated at the time because Shokin was widely seen as a failure.\n\nBloomberg reported that \u201cthe U.S. plan to push for Shokin\u2019s dismissal didn\u2019t initially come from Biden, but rather filtered up from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation\u201d and that, in the same month Biden traveled to Ukraine, \u201chundreds of Ukrainians demonstrated outside President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s office demanding Shokin\u2019s resignation, and he was dismissed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis decision creates an opportunity to make a fresh start in the prosecutor general\u2019s office. I hope that the new prosecutor general will ensure that [his office] becomes independent from political influence and pressure and enjoys public trust,\u201d said Jan Tombinski, the European Union\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, in a statement when the firing was announced that decried the \u201clack of tangible results of investigations into serious cases.\u201d\n\nNote that the money in question was $1 billion in loan guarantees \u2014 not \u201cbillions\u201d as Trump claimed.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "The president levels new charges against former vice president Joe Biden. we dissect his claims and find them wanting.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker", "Salvador Rizzo", "Reporter For The Fact Checker", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E3BK2PGAiYfBT0KFNnx-vd6n7PM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X4C5ICG5IAI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
