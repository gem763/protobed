The amount of money received by the recipients would correlate with the amount of time they served for their crimes.\n\nO'Rourke, 46, who is among the most ardent in calling for the decriminalization of marijuana, suggested the tax money could also be used to support ex-marijuana convicts find work, homes, and even break into the legal marijuana trade. O'Rourke says the marijuana tax revenue could also benefit substance abuse centers.\n\nHe has called for the decriminalization of unauthorized border crossings, also called for marijuana offenses to be wiped from the criminal records of illegal immigrants so that those infractions would not prevent the pursuit of American naturalization and citizenship.\n\n[Also read: Beto O'Rourke: Fines will 'compel' AR-15 owners to turn their guns in]", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke detailed a plan Thursday to legalize marijuana across the United States.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df05f82/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+89/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Ff8%2F8d%2F9d4045224778a7b8ca2a1b8ab460%2Fbeto-orourke-experience.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
