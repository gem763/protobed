It now seems that the window for discourse about economic reality is moving as well.\n\nTake the headline on David Leonhardt\u2019s recent New York Times column, summarizing the research of economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who are advisers to Elizabeth Warren: \u201cThe rich really do pay lower taxes than you.\u201d\n\nNo, they do not.\n\nIn a progressive system, people with higher incomes are required to pay a larger share of their income in taxes. This is reasonable and fair because people differ in their ability to earn income and because the labor-market rewards for workers of different skill levels are determined by factors other than ability and effort.\n\nContrary to the narrative that seems to be forming on the political left, the U.S. federal tax code is very progressive. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the lowest-income 20% of households have an average federal tax rate of about 2%. Those in the middle 20% pay 14% of their income in federal taxes. Higher-income households face higher rates. The top 20% pay a 27% federal rate. And the federal tax rate for the top 1% is 33%. These data are for 2016, the most recent year available.\n\nThis is half of the story. When assessing the progressivity of the U.S. federal system, it makes sense to look at both taxes and the means-tested transfer payments \u2014 Medicaid, food stamps and Supplemental Security Income \u2014 that those taxes fund.\n\nIf you subtract these payments from federal taxes paid, the tax rate for the top 20% of households (including the top 1%) is unchanged, as those households don\u2019t receive means-tested benefits. The tax rate for households in the middle 20% drops considerably, from 14% to 9%. And the rate for the bottom 20% of households plummets to minus 70%. Those households receive $49 in transfer payments for every $1 they pay in federal tax.\n\nWhen assessing the total tax burden facing different U.S. households, looking at federal, state and local taxes is instructive. The federal system is more progressive than state and local systems, but combining them \u2014 as the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has done \u2014 doesn\u2019t change the story: the higher your income, the greater your tax burden. Harvard economist and top Obama adviser Jason Furman confirms this by combining federal taxes and transfers with state and local taxes.\n\nHow to square this with Saez\u2019s and Zucman\u2019s research? There is an active debate among economists about technical questions in income measurement. How much of the income that is not reported on tax returns should be assumed to have been earned by the rich? How to account for unrealized capital gains when determining income? Which income group pays the corporate income tax? How should social insurance programs that transfer income across a person\u2019s life cycle \u2014 for example, Social Security and Medicare \u2014 be treated?\n\nThe answers to those questions, and to many others, in large part determine the conclusions about how the tax code treats different groups of households. That applies to any analysis, including mine, above, and to Saez\u2019s and Zucman\u2019s.\n\nBut the existence of this academic debate shouldn\u2019t obscure the overwhelming consensus among economists that the U.S. tax system is progressive. This consensus holds even when you look within the top 1% of households. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center finds that this group faces the highest tax rate.\n\nSaez and Zucman train much of their focus on the 400 wealthiest Americans. This group makes up 0.0003% of households. The New York Times column describing the Saez-Zucman estimates reports that last year this group had a 23% combined federal, state and local tax rate.\n\nIn fact, the jury is still out on that number, which is based on a forecast of what income might have been last year. (The data for 2018 aren\u2019t in. If you filed for an extension, your taxes for 2018 aren\u2019t due until next week.) Even if it turns out to be correct, it doesn\u2019t follow that the U.S. system is not progressive.\n\nCharacterizing features of the tax system based on a few hundred individuals is silly. For one, people cycle in and out of the top 400 every year. And there are over 120 million households in the U.S. The tax code can create strange situations for some of them, depending on their circumstances.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For Democrats, the Overton window \u2014 the range of ideas that are not considered extreme \u2014 has shifted markedly to the left in the last few years.
