Nine years later, after Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, her mother returned to fetch the girls. \u201cOne day was normal, then we were on our flight to the U.S.A.,\u201d Ressa recalls. Ressa and her sister moved in with their mother, American stepfather and new sister in Toms River, N.J. At Toms River North High School, Ressa played piano, violin and guitar, won a countywide debate contest and served as class president her freshman, sophomore and junior years. Ressa attended Princeton \u2014 her classmates included Bezos, a casual acquaintance \u2014 and wrote a play about Philippine politics for her senior thesis. After graduating in 1986, she was awarded a Fulbright fellowship to study political theater in Manila.\n\nRessa\u2019s return to her native country came as it was transitioning away from authoritarianism and adopting liberal, democratic ideas from the United States. In 1987, under the newly inaugurated president, Corazon C. Aquino, the country established a Constitution that limited presidential powers and set up a bicameral legislature. CNN was looking for a fluent English speaker to report on the transformation and hired Ressa. She became a fixture of the network\u2019s Asia coverage, on the front lines of the fight between democratic ideas and authoritarianism.\n\nRessa was interested not only in how democratic ideals flourished but also in how they died, and how extremist ideology spread like a toxin through a society. Thirteen months after the Sept. 11 attacks, she was on assignment, investigating Islamic terrorist networks in the Philippines, when bombers struck two Bali nightclubs and killed 202 people. Ressa began digging. \u201cShe was connecting the dots where others hadn\u2019t,\u201d recalls Atika Shubert, whom Ressa hired as an intern in the Jakarta bureau in 1997 and who later became a CNN correspondent there. \u201cAt one point she said to me, \u2018These guys all went to a training program in Afghanistan!\u2019 \u201d Ressa\u2019s groundbreaking reporting led to the 2003 publication of her first book, \u201cSeeds of Terror,\u201d about the nexus between the Sept. 11 plotters and Southeast Asian terrorist cells.\n\nIn 2004, ABS-CBN hired her away from her post as CNN\u2019s Jakarta bureau chief to manage its news division. Ressa returned to Manila filled with ideas about the power of the news media to bolster democracy and expose and check leaders\u2019 authoritarian impulses. By then, she understood how terrorist ideology had found a home online and how social media allowed ideas to spread with exponential force. \u201cFrom Bin Laden to Facebook,\u201d her second book, published in 2013, was a deep dive into the dissemination of terrorist ideology on the internet, an investigation that foreshadowed the Islamic State\u2019s recruitment of acolytes via social media. \u201cMaria was fascinated by the spread of an idea,\u201d Shubert says. \u201cA lot of people looked at terrorism strictly in terms of security and logistics. Maria saw that it was much more.\u201d\n\nRessa knew that the place to combat that ideology was where it spread, and the Philippines was rapidly growing more connected. Young people were going online in huge numbers, usually on mobile devices, and Ressa viewed them as instruments of change. In 2011, Ressa and five colleagues from ABS-CBN left their jobs and amassed $2 million in seed money. (Ressa retains 23.7 percent of the shares of Rappler.) They recruited six journalists and equipped each one with an iPhone and a laptop. Rappler \u2014 a portmanteau of \u201crap\u201d and \u201cripple,\u201d as in ripples of change \u2014 went live on Jan. 1, 2012. At first, remembers Glenda Gloria, an original partner and now Rappler\u2019s managing editor, Rappler reporters \u201cwere the laughingstock, doing live reports with their iPhones.\u201d Competitors derided the mostly female reporting staff as \u201cRappler-ettes.\u201d But Rappler made its mark covering a devastating cyclone and breaking a story about a Philippine university that had granted the Supreme Court chief justice a civil-law doctorate without a dissertation. He was eventually impeached after multiple charges of corruption. The news site also began to take an interest in a brutishly charismatic mayor named Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nIn late 2015, Pia Ranada, a 25-year-old Rappler reporter new to the politics beat, volunteered to cover Duterte\u2019s long-shot bid for the presidency. She began trailing him to campaign events before the rest of the news media caught on, and the two developed a rapport. \u201cDuterte remembers if you were there from the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of a comfort zone for him.\u201d Ranada\u2019s coverage was among the first to bring national attention to Duterte\u2019s candidacy, at a time when Rappler\u2019s reach was expanding rapidly. In January 2016, Rappler sponsored a live debate anchored by Ressa that every presidential candidate but Duterte passed on. \u201cHe was charming,\u201d Gloria says. \u201cHe won over the crowd.\u201d", "description": "Rappler, one of the country\u2019s most popular media platforms, has incurred President Duterte and his supporters\u2019 wrath by investigating his extrajudicial killing campaign.", "authors": ["Joshua Hammer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/magazine/20mag-rappler/20mag-rappler-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
