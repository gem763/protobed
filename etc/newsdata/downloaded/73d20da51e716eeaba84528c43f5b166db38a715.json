This will be deeply troubling to people who have come here in good faith and who contribute so much to our society.\n\n\u201cMany of us have warned that the government\u2019s approach could lead to another scandal like Windrush. This Tory government seems determined to prove our worst fears correct - once again showing you can\u2019t trust this government.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrat Home Affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine also hit out at Mr Lewis' comments.\n\n(Image: PA Archive)\n\nMs Jardine: \u201cI am absolutely appalled.\n\n\"I have just been at a school where a Hungarian-born pupil told me she was scared about Brexit, and now I learn that the Conservative Government is threatening to deport people like her.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one seriously believes the Home Office will have granted Settled Status to all 3.6 million EU citizens by the Conservatives\u2019 arbitrary December 2020 deadline. Thousands will inevitably be left effectively undocumented \u2013 and now the Government is saying it will deport them.\n\nMr Lewis later took to Twitter to say his word had \"somewhat\" been taken out of context, but didn't rule out deportations.\n\nHe tweeted: \"My words are somewhat taken out of context.\n\n\"EU Citizens have till at least Dec 2020 & there\u2019s plenty of help available to apply.\n\n\"We\u2019ve now had 2 million applications & we\u2019ve always said we\u2019ll allow time for those with reasonable grounds for missing the deadline.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cEU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay.\n\n\u201cThe EU Settlement Scheme is a free and easy way for EU citizens to get the UK immigration status they need.\n\n\u201cWe have received two million applications and are looking for reasons to grant status, not refuse, and EU citizens have until at least December 2020 to apply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they\u2019ll be given a further opportunity to apply.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nYesterday, the Home Office revealed that over 2 million people had applied for settled status.\n\nThe scheme asks applicants to prove their identity, demonstrate they live in the UK, and declare any criminal convictions.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel welcomed the numbers of applications.\n\nShe said: \u201cEU citizens have made a huge contribution to this country and will play a key role in cementing Britain\u2019s status as an outward-looking, global leader after Brexit.\n\n\u201cThat is why I am thrilled that we have had 2 million applications to the EU settlement scheme so that EU citizens can secure their immigration status under UK law.\u201d", "description": "Those who haven't applied by the deadline without a good reason would face normal immigration rules a government minister has claimed", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Getty", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa Archive", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19601231.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brandon-Lewis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
