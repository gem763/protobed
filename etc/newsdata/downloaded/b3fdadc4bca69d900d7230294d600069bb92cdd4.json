Adam Schiff (D-CA) \u2013 were not briefed on the raid in advance due to the fear of leaks. The president confirmed that in his statement on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe notified some; others are being notified as I speak,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWe were going to notify them last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere is no country in the world that leaks like we do and Washington is a leaking machine.\u201d\n\nPelosi, while congratulating the \u201cdedication and skill of our military and our intelligence professionals,\u201d took a veiled shot at Trump in her statement, lamenting that the \u201cRussians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified\u201d in advance.\n\nHer full statement reads:\n\nAmericans salute the heroism, and acknowledge the work of our partners in the region. We are relieved that no U.S. personnel died in this daring raid. The death of al-Baghdadi is significant, but the death of this ISIS leader does not mean the death of ISIS. Scores of ISIS fighters remain under uncertain conditions in Syrian prisons, and countless others in the region and around the world remain intent on spreading their influence and committing acts of terror. This month, the House passed a joint resolution on an overwhelmingly bipartisan 354-60 basis which rejects President Trump\u2019s green-lighting of Turkish aggression into Syria against our Kurdish partners, and calls on him to present a clear strategy to defeat ISIS. The House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region. Our military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington.\n\nDespite Pelosi\u2019s veiled shot, Trump\u2019s announcement earned the praise of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT)\u2013 a notorious critic of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cAl Baghdadi spread \u2018fire and brimstone\u2019 on earth; now he feels it for himself in hell,\u201d Romney wrote. \u201cTo all who arranged his change of venue\u2014the intel officers, the President, the warriors\u2014thank you\u201d:", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) took a veiled shot at President Trump on Sunday after he announced the death of\u00a0ISIS founder al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181652244-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
