(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Mike Richter, a retired NHL goaltender, was growing up, the duck ponds around Philadelphia would freeze each winter, neighborhood kids would lace up their skates, and \u201cI\u2019d be out there all day,\u201d he recalled Wednesday. \u201cMy world just stopped.\u201d\n\nWith temperatures warming, he fears children today won\u2019t discover and fall in love with ice hockey the way he once did, that outdoor pastime propelling Richter to a career that included a Stanley Cup title and an Olympic silver medal.\n\n\u201cWhen I see a pond melt, I know the lost opportunity for this generation to experience this wonderful game that I was able to grow up with,\u201d the 52-year-old told a Senate special committee. \u201cWhat we need to understand is that this represents something far more ominous.\u201d\n\nRichter was among the athletes who visited Capitol Hill this week and spoke at a hearing before the Senate Democrats\u2019 Special Committee on the Climate Crisis. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), chair of the panel, convened the group to explore climate change through the lens of sports, calling the hearing: \u201cThe Fight to Save Winter: Pro Athletes for Climate Action.\u201d\n\n[Skating is a way of life in the Netherlands, but warming temperatures are changing that]\n\nWhile the assembled Democrats and athletes discussed climate change as a critical economic, health and science matter, Schatz said he wanted to highlight that it\u2019s also a pressing lifestyle issue that affects millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cAll of your assumptions about how you spend your time in the winter and summers, what you\u2019re able to do with your family when you have free time and a little bit of money are going to change if we don\u2019t take action,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were powerful advocates for doing something about climate, especially because they don\u2019t have a political agenda. They\u2019re just on the front lines, seeing what\u2019s happening in the real world.\u201d\n\nThe athletes told the senators about the changing conditions they see on the mountains, the shrinking winters and warming temperatures that threaten the sports and activities that rely on snow, ice and cold weather.\n\nJeremy Jones, a veteran snowboarder and founder of the advocacy group Protect Our Winters, pointed to a 2017 study by University of Colorado researchers that suggested the length of winter recreation seasons will shrink in some areas by 50 percent by 2050 and 80 percent by 2090.\n\n\u201cWhich means winter as we know it would be three weeks long,\u201d Jones told the lawmakers. \u201cThat is heartbreaking. I\u2019m also a father, [and] to think my kids\u2019 kids could be the last generation of skiers is a big deal.\u201d\n\n[Extreme heat is changing sports]\n\nClimber Tommy Caldwell and ski mountaineer Caroline Gleich also told the senators they regularly see signs that warming temperatures are eroding conditions and will have a devastating effect on sports Americans love to play and watch.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt increased temperatures are melting away both my sport and my livelihood,\u201d Gleich said.\n\nThe athletes stressed that while climate change impacts competition and recreation, it\u2019s also a major economic concern for businesses, resorts and towns that rely on cold weather to keep ski lifts open, equipment sales up and visitors filling restaurants and hotel rooms. Jones pointed to a 2017 report from the Outdoor Industry Association that found snow sports generate $72 billion annually and support 695,000 jobs.\n\nThe invited athletes are part of a larger group of winter sports competitors who have been outspoken about environmental issues in recent years. Others were in the gallery in the hearing room Wednesday and met privately with senators earlier in the week.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing marked the third time the special committee had convened and the first time it specifically addressed the impact climate change could have on the sports world. Schatz said after the hearing that given their platform, athletes could play an important role in helping people better understand the issue and the sweeping impact.\n\n\u201cPeople personally feel passionately about sports. In order to mobilize the movement necessary to take action, we\u2019re going to have to generate passion,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cPeople feel very passionately about their weekends with the families and the uninterrupted time they get to spend in nature. All of that is changing.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nExtreme climate change has arrived in America\n\nDangerous new hot zones are spreading around the world", "description": "Skiers, snowboarders and climbers tell Senate Democrats how shrinking winters and warming temperatures are impacting winter sports", "authors": ["Rick Maese", "Reporter Covering A Variety Of Subjects", "Including Health", "Safety", "Olympics", "Legal", "Political Issues In Sports", "Rick Maese Is A Sports Features Writer For The Washington Post.
