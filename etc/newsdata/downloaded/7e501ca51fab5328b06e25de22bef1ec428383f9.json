In the UK, the bank Northern Rock got into trouble in late 2007, and then all hell broke loose in the autumn of 2008 with Lehman Brothers going bust.\u201d\n\nCompanies laid off staff, froze pay or shortened working hours to try to survive. The flow of money around the economy slowed - access to credit was restricted. And that fed through into the housing market.\n\nHouse prices, which had risen steadily since the mid-1990s, had been falling in the recession. But this time, unlike in 1997, there was no sweet spot.\n\n\u201cFor prospective house-buyers like yourselves, 2009 was a funny place,\u201d says Jonathan.\n\nIn August 2009, the average house price in the south-east of England was just above \u00a3206,000.\n\n\u201cHouse prices in real terms had grown by 120% since our last year - 1997. But incomes were up by only 25%. That made it a lot harder to buy a house,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Great Recession - as it is now known - also had a greater impact on young people than older generations. Twenty-somethings suffered the biggest falls in earnings and higher unemployment rates. Companies tightened their belts and stopped hiring.\n\nThe late 1990s and first half of the 2000s had seen house prices soar, particularly in the most crowded part of the UK - London and the South East. Demand was outstripping supply. Buy-to-let and overseas investors continued to look for property alongside traditional house-hunters.\n\n\u201cAnd we start to see television shows like Homes Under the Hammer - about selling your house to make a profit,\u201d says historian Claire Langhamer.\n\nFewer homes were also being built. Housebuilding figures fluctuated around the 200,000-a-year mark at the start of the noughties - less than half the total in 1968. By 2009, the number of completed dwellings in the UK had dropped to 157,000.\n\nAnd during the 2009 credit crunch, for those young buyers living in expensive parts of the country, getting a mortgage would also have been tricky.\n\n\u201cThere was a massive contraction of mortgage lending,\u201d says personal finance expert Sharon Collard. \u201cLoan to value of 75% became fairly standard. You\u2019d need a 25% deposit - a big chunk of money. Lenders\u2019 appetites for risk had completely collapsed - and the regulators forced them to become more responsible for their lending.\u201d\n\nThe tough conditions are borne out in figures on home ownership from the Resolution Foundation think tank. In the south-east of England between 1988 and 2009, home ownership among 25 to 34-year-olds fell from 58% to 36%. By 2018 it had dropped further \u2013 to under 30%.\n\nBut for those young people able to get on the 2009 housing ladder, there was one \u201csaving grace\u201d says Jonathan Cribb. Record low interest rates.\n\n\u201cThis was the point where the gap between renters and owner-occupiers opened up. Rents had increased over the decade, and when the Bank of England cut interest rates to keep the economy afloat, that brought mortgage rates down.\n\n\u201cThose who did get a home benefitted from very cheap credit.\u201d\n\nCharlie and Tacita wonder about their August 2009 earnings.\n\nLooking at his spreadsheet, Jonathan says a young couple like them - earning slightly above average wages - would have earned about \u00a337,000. In today\u2019s money, that\u2019s almost \u00a346,000 - and more than they currently earn.\n\n\u201cIt means over the past 10 years young people's earnings have actually fallen back a bit - one of the reasons why it\u2019s so hard to buy in 2019,\u201d says Jonathan.\n\nThe sums for August 2009:\n\n\u00b7 Tacita and Charlie have a 2019 gross income of \u00a343,500, which is slightly above average for couples in their mid-20s\n\n\u00b7 In 2009, a couple in a similar position would have an estimated gross income of \u00a337,000 - that\u2019s nearly \u00a346,000 in today\u2019s money\n\n\u00b7 After saving for an estimated 25% deposit, they could borrow about \u00a3116,000 at an interest rate of 3.9%\n\n\u00b7 In 2009, they could buy a property costing about \u00a3155,000 - that\u2019s roughly \u00a3192,000 in today\u2019s money\n\nSources/calculations: Institute for Fiscal Studies, Savills UK, Building Societies Association, Bank of England\n\nEven if they could have raised a deposit of more than \u00a338,000 - and bought for \u00a3155,000 - there are slim pickings in the Evening Argus property pages.\n\nOnly about half a dozen properties in Brighton would have been affordable.\n\n\u201cThe 2009 deposit would definitely have been a problem. The deposit is partly why we have a problem right now,\u201d says Charlie. \u201cPeople ask me why I haven\u2019t moved out of my mother\u2019s home. I could rent a house in 2019, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to save. Renting and saving at the same time is totally unrealistic.\u201d\n\nThe present day situation for first-time buyers is an intractable problem, says personal finance expert Sharon Collard.\n\n\u201cSome people are doing extremely well out of housing wealth, while others just can\u2019t get on the ladder. And that seems very unfair. There are now at least eight government housing schemes aimed predominantly at helping first-time buyers. That's great, but it just kind of sums it all up doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nAnd how do Charlie and Tacita feel after their journey back in time?\n\n\u201cWe came all the way from buying semi-detached houses to barely being able to afford a flat on a leasehold,\u201d says Charlie.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that to buy in 2019, you\u2019re either in the North - like one of my friends who has managed it - or you\u2019re down here and you\u2019ve been given some help from parents.\u201d\n\nTacita say she is not depressed by what she learned.\n\n\u201cOlder generations say it was just as hard back then,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I come away from this time trip feeling almost relieved that our hunch was accurate - that we are probably the generation for whom house-buying is the hardest.\u201d\n\nThe couple doubt they will ever be able to get on the property ladder in the south of England.\n\nSo what will they do?\n\n\u201cWe have to look at an alternative route,\u201d says Charlie. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to buy a conventional house.\u201d\n\nThey are seriously thinking of building a so-called \u201ctiny home\u201d - explains Charlie - a small self-contained eco cabin, possibly on a trailer.\n\n\u201cWhatever we do will be a long slog,\u201d adds Tacita. \u201cBut we hope to get benefits back in the longer term, with lower bills and no mortgage.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Paul Kerley"], "top_image": "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/extra/shorthand/assets/news/pjfxZM72Gj/assets/f5OfWrkMeU/top_final-nc-2560x1440.png"}
