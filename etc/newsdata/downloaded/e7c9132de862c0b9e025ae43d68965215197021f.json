What were you doing in the middle of the night when you told this jury that you were so comatose by the tablets that you took?\n\n\"Had you done something, Miss Denton, that night that required you to steal away in the middle of the night for what appears to be a couple of hours?\"\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n\n\nMiss Denton suggested the story had been the result of \"close gossip\" among neighbours and repeatedly denied being awake.\n\nContinuing, Mr Sidhu said: \"Your friend has a very different version.\n\n\"She reports a conversation with you. She says that you made some mention of events early that morning and it was along the lines of that you were messaging some uni friends when Kevin was upstairs with Harper.\n\n\"She said it was 4am.\n\n\"It was a group conversation about babies and you were flailing yourself for not being with Harper.\n\n\"What are you hiding?\"\n\nResponding, Miss Denton said: \"I have nothing to hide, absolutely nothing to hide.\"\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Kevin Eves, 37, from Wixams, near Bedford, is\u00a0 trial over the death of his eight-week-old daughter Harper Denton, who was found 'purple' in a Moses basket", "authors": ["William Janes", "Image", "Central News", "Pa Archive Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584944.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-cnl_C_Denton_1b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
