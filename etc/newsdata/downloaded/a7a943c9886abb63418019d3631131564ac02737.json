Because various Trump\u2019s officials sent text messages about it. Here\u2019s one from Bill Taylor, an official at the US Embassy in Ukraine, to Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, on September 1st, 2019:\n\nAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\n\nSondland simply replies \u201ccall me,\u201d which is a solid response if 1) you suspect a Slack DM is about to go off the rails, or 2) you are a Trump appointee who senses that a paper trail maybe isn\u2019t a great idea.\n\nAnyway, Taylor hit up Sondland on September 9th, 2019, to talk about the crimes again:\n\nAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\n\nFive hours later, after reportedly conferring with Trump, Sondland wrote back saying that the president \u201chas been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind\u201d and \u201csuggests we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s one lesson everyone can learn from the hapless, bumbling Trump administration, it\u2019s this: please stop texting about crimes.\n\nRelatedly, later today, Attorney General William Barr will send an open letter to Facebook requesting that it halt its plans to encrypt its messaging apps until it builds a backdoor for law enforcement.", "description": "The unfolding Trump impeachment scandal is very simple to understand: it is illegal to solicit help from a foreign government in an election, and Trump and his aides repeatedly tried to push the new government of Ukraine into digging up dirt on Joe Biden by withholding an aid package.
