The letter will say that the White House won\u2019t comply with the Democrats\u2019 investigation because Pelosi hasn\u2019t codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor.\n\nPelosi showed no signs of backing down, however, writing back to McCarthy: \"The existing rules of the House provide House Committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations. There is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nThe Republican complaints come as House Democrats intensify and widen their impeachment inquiry. Last week, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and Cummings sent a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Friday is the deadline for Pompeo to comply with the subpoena. If he doesn\u2019t, the move will likely fuel Democrats\u2019 case and could prompt obstruction allegations.\n\nCommittee leaders, meanwhile, had announced Wednesday they plan to subpoena the White House for documents related to any efforts to pressure Ukraine to probe Joe Biden. This is what prompted the retort from Jordan and other Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe White House\u2019s flagrant disregard of multiple voluntary requests for documents\u2014combined with stark and urgent warnings from the Inspector General about the gravity of these allegations\u2014have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena,\u201d a memo prepared by Cummings said.\n\nLawmakers are seeking documents \"memorializing communications between President Trump and the leader of any other foreign country\" that relate to Trump's efforts to pursue investigations of political rivals. The subpoena is directed toward acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. It requests 13 separate batches of documents related to the July phone call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and related matters. The oversight panel will issue the subpoena in coordination with the House intelligence and foreign affairs committees, Cummings said.\n\nAlso on Friday, intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson was testifying behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee. Atkinson is the one who originally flagged the whistleblower complaint about Trump's Ukraine call as an urgent matter of concern. His interview comes a day after committees heard from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Kurt Volker.\n\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS PREP WHITE HOUSE SUBPOENA AS TRUMP CALLS BS ON IMPEACHMENT PUSH\n\nPelosi announced the formal impeachment inquiry last week, amid the uproar surrounding Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, in which he sought an investigation into the dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in Ukraine -- namely, Hunter's lucrative role on the board of a natural gas firm and his father's role in the ouster of a prosecutor who had been investigating the firm's founder. Joe Biden has denied wrongdoing, as has Trump.\n\nDemocrats have claimed that the call revealed a quid pro quo, saying Trump tied his request to investigate the Bidens to military aid. Trump reportedly ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the call. The call transcript did not show Trump explicitly mentioning the aid as a bargaining chip.\n\nIn addition to the potential White House subpoena and subpoena for Pompeo, the committee chairs have also issued a subpoena for the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Congressional Republicans are blasting Democrats for charging ahead with subpoenas to the White House for information related to the Ukraine controversy amid their\u00a0impeachment inquiry,\u00a0claiming they did so without consulting GOP members.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
