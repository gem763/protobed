The fighting has prompted a flood of Kurdish refugees out of Syria and caused a political headache for the president, who has been accused by Republicans and Democrats alike of abandoning US allies in the region.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Attorney General William Barr has booked a holiday party for 200 people at the hotel in December that could generate more than $30,000 (\u00a323,000) in revenue for Trump's business.\n\nFAI leaders said their goal was not to fund the Trump Organisation but rather to use the venue to raise awareness about the Kurdish plight and transcend partisan differences. Still, the backlash to their choice of venue was swift.\n\n\u201cWe've been bombarded with emails and responses on social media and phone calls of people who are understandably confused by why we would choose to do [the event] at this location, at Trump hotel, which is owned by the president who made this decision that is causing so much bloodshed and turmoil right now for the Kurds,\u201d Mr Thomas said in an online video that was posted Sunday.\n\nMr Thomas and another leader of the group, Joel Richardson, explained that the intention was to show \u201chonour and respect and humility\u201d for the office of the president while also being \u201chonest about what's taking place\u201d with the Kurds.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

And so this is the approach we've chosen to do that,\u201d Mr Richardson said in the video. \u201cWe are going to, if you will, the president's living room, and we're doing our best to have an honouring, respectful, family discussion.\u201d\n\nHe added that since \u201cevery news story somehow ends up being all about Trump\u201d that it would be good publicity for the issue.\n\nAfter the cancellation, Mr Thomas said, \u201cIt's their prerogative to cancel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it's a shame they used that prerogative though as this was an opportunity for the Trump administration,\u201d he added. \u201cIt seems as though they set out to '[snatch] defeat from the jaws of victory' this month on everything.\u201d\n\nMr Thomas said the Trump Organisation had refunded its money and that FAI now planned to hold the event Sunday at the Grand Hyatt Washington hotel.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "A\u00a0Christian aid group that planned a gathering to honour and pray for the Kurdish people at President Donald Trump's hotel here were told by hotel staff this week that the event was cancelled, according to two members of the aid group.", "authors": ["Joshua Partlow"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/15/trump-hotel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
