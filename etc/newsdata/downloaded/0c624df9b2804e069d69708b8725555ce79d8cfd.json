A table near mine, set for six, expanded to seat ten, then shrank for eight, then enlarged to fit a party of twelve, and was finally occupied, as I finished my meal, by a pack of extremely young women, teenagers, really, with the willowy frames and lovely faces of neophyte models, and a smaller number of older men who appeared to be \u2026 well \u2026 smug probably sums it up best.\n\nA quarter century later, I was reminded of that dinner when Brunel suddenly riveted the world\u2019s attention in the hours immediately before the suicide of the notorious pervert pederast Jeffrey Epstein, when it was alleged that the Frenchman had provided underage women to the very freaky financier.\n\nShortly after that Miami night, I interviewed Brunel, among many others, for a book on the modeling industry, published in 1995 as Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women. So, although I never met nor wrote about Epstein, my phone started ringing following his latest arrest for trafficking underage women, and it hasn\u2019t stopped since, as expos\u00e9s of Brunel pile up like a mound of fetid garbage, notably in England\u2019s Guardian, France\u2019s Liberation, the Washington Post, and The Daily Beast. And reporters have told me that apparently, I\u2019m among the very few journalists who ever interviewed the then-elusive and now impossible-to-find Brunel.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to this story than the handful of damning quotations the papers have lifted from Model, from and about the man sometimes described as a rabbateur, i.e . one who beats the bushes during a hunt to drive game out into the open. There is the videotape of a 60 Minutes segment from 1988\u2014long suppressed by legal order\u2014that exposed him as an alleged serial abuser of young women, for instance; interviews with competitors who described him as a serial rapist; and a 28-page transcript of our taped interview in which I asked about the charges that Brunel was way more loco than parentis with the young women in his charge, as well as his oft-reported fondness for the Champagne of bottled drugs, cocaine.\n\nHis assurances of his innocence then were barely credible, but I felt a responsibility to report them alongside the sordid charges against him, and some of the more damning passages from our conversation. But I left out what happened the same night as our daytime interview. I don\u2019t remember why I was in the nightclub Les Bains Douches that evening\u2014it was 25 years ago after all\u2014but what happened there and afterward is a crystal-clear memory, most likely because I\u2019d planned to include it in a final chapter of Model that was never written because the book was already long and tawdry enough.\n\nMy plan was to conclude the tome with a chapter on the youngest models of all, known as test board kids, discovered in malls and at modeling conventions and then thrown into the deep end of fashion\u2019s pool\u2014the studios and clubs of Paris and Milan\u2014where they would either swim or sink. I\u2019d chosen a handful of them at an annual modeling convention in New York, asked them to be my pen pals for a year, and that day at Brunel\u2019s agency, Karin, met one of them, Robin [I\u2019ve changed the models\u2019 names], a Midwesterner who\u2019d signed with him. She introduced me to her friend, who called herself Dakota, and we chatted and went our separate ways.\n\nBut there was Dakota, on the restaurant floor above the disco at Bains Douches, sitting with Brunel and another group of models and older men at a huge table. And when she waved hello, it was clear she was miserable. She told me she hated the place and Brunel had forced her to come. \u201cCan you get us out of here?\u201d she whispered, gesturing to another model. Sure, easy.\n\n\u201c He\u2019d struck me as shrewd, smug and vaguely sleazy. She\u2019d told me she\u2019d had to rebuff his advances. \u201d\n\nI took them in a taxi to their \u201cmodel\u201d apartment off the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, a crowded room where dirty clothes covered every inch of floor and Dakota told me she\u2019d moved there after first living with Brunel at his far more spacious and glamorous apartment nearby on Avenue Hoche. There, she\u2019d discovered an apparent peep hole that looked into the bathrooms the models in residence used, inspiring her to flee, albeit not very far. The only part of the story that wasn\u2019t normal was that peep hole. Models often bunk in their agents\u2019 homes. \u201cWant to see it?\u201d Dakota asked. She still had a key.\n\nAround the corner we went, then up one of those old French cage elevators, to a far more lavish flat, where, sure enough, there was a hidden hole drilled through a wall and a view of a bathroom. The girls were laughing about their escape when Brunel joined us. Earlier that day, he\u2019d denied that he still used cocaine. \u201cI had a problem,\u201d he\u2019d said in a staccato burst, \u201cit was not a major. I mean, it was a problem\u2026. For four or five years I did it as fun, because I never did it in the day, and then I did it as an experiment, fine, it lasted maybe a bit longer than it should, but it had never been like a problem, it had never been\u2014I was at work at 9 in the morning.\u201d But, as the notes I took afterwards say, he was \u201cuncommonly animated,\u201d so I wouldn\u2019t have vouched for the truth of that assertion. And he was with a friend with a case of the sniffles. And the peephole? \u201cI want you to look behind all the mirrors,\u201d he said. Frankly, I just wanted out of there.\n\nA demand that Dakota return to Bains Douches with him made me nervous. Earlier that day, he\u2019d struck me as shrewd, smug and vaguely sleazy. She\u2019d told me she\u2019d had to rebuff his advances. His reappearance added scary to that list.\n\nThere was a white Ferrari with a white leather interior sitting outside his building. Dakota sat in front and when Brunel offered to drop me off en route, I squeezed into the back. Her hand snaked around the seat where Brunel couldn\u2019t see it. I grabbed it. She squeezed, until we reached the Pont des Arts, and I got out of the thrumming car. \u201cWill you be okay?\u201d I whispered to Dakota. Her voice said yes. Her eyes weren\u2019t so sure. And off they roared into the night.\n\nSome time later, I got a letter from Dakota. She was still in Paris\u2014and I never learned more of what happened to her. But she reported that Robin had returned to the prairie, suffering from an ulcer. I never heard from her again, either. But what young woman, full of dreams, would want to tell the tale of how she failed as a fashion model\u2014even if quitting was one of the smartest choices she ever made?\n\nOver the years since, I vaguely kept tabs on the agents who were the protagonists, if not the heroes, of Model. So I heard that Brunel had broken with this and that partner and founded an agency of his own in Miami. And beginning about a decade ago, when I first learned of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, I certainly wasn\u2019t surprised. For his part, Brunel and his lawyers have denied the claims that he recruited underage girls for Epstein and abused them himself. Still, he\u2019s disappeared in the wake of Epstein\u2019s arrest and suicide.\n\nNow, of course, I feel for the no-longer young women who have finally been emboldened to speak out about Brunel. And I wonder\u2014and still worry\u2014about Dakota.", "description": "I don\u2019t remember why I was in the nightclub Les Bains Douches that evening, but what happened there and afterward is a crystal-clear memory.", "authors": ["Michael Gross"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567112613/190828-gross-jean-luc-brunel-lede_rc8wba", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
