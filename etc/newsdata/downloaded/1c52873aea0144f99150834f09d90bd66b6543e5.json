But He May Not.", "language": "en", "text": "The most important LGBTQ equality cases since same-sex marriage may be a toss-up. And the swing vote\u2014surprisingly, based on today\u2019s oral arguments\u2014may be Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nAt issue in today\u2019s three cases is whether the federal anti-discrimination law, known as Title VII, protects gay and trans workers from being fired because of who they are. That law does not mention sexual orientation or gender identity. But, LGBTQ advocates argue, when someone is fired for being LGBTQ, that is covered under Title VII\u2019s ban on discrimination \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d\n\nAfter all, they argued today, if a man is fired from his job for disclosing that he is attracted to other men\u2014as happened to Gerald Bostock, one of the plaintiffs today\u2014that is sex discrimination: had Gerald Bostock been a woman, he wouldn\u2019t have been fired.\n\nLikewise, when Aimee Stephens transitioned from male to female, her employer (a funeral home) fired her. She attended the Supreme Court on Tuesday, accompanied by her attorneys and actress and advocate Laverne Cox.\n\nOnce again, Stephens' advocates argued, this is discrimination \u201cbecause of sex\u201d: had Stephens been biologically female (or, more precisely, assigned the sex of female at birth), she would not have been fired for coming to work dressed as the woman she is.\n\nThat the cases are at the Supreme Court might surprise many. The vast majority of Americans\u201472 percent, according to UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute\u2014say that transgender people should be protected from employment discrimination. The number is even higher for LGB people.\n\nIn fact, a majority of Americans think that it\u2019s already illegal to fire someone for being gay or trans, and are surprised to hear that it isn\u2019t.\n\nAt oral arguments today at the Supreme Court, the ideologically divided court\u2014five conservatives, four liberals\u2014mostly hewed to form.\n\nFirst, the Court\u2019s four liberals all seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs. Justice Elena Kagan said that Title VII \u201cpretty firmly\u201d backs their claims that they\u2019d been discriminated against \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d She said the test was \u201cextremely simple\u201d: Would the same thing have happened to you if you were a different sex? If not, that\u2019s sex discrimination.\n\nAnd Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg noted that Title VII has been expanded before. Sexual harassment was also not explicitly included in the law, yet cases involving harassment are now routinely covered by it.\n\nOn the other hand, Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concern that the Court was being asked to take the role of Congress, and indeed override Congress\u2019s express refusal to protect gay and trans workers. (The Equality Act, which would do so, passed the House earlier this year but has not been brought up for a vote in the Senate.)\n\nThis is certainly correct. Even if LGBTQ advocates\u2019 reading of Title VII makes sense on paper, it clearly defies both Congress\u2019 understanding of the law and its refusal to expand it.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito was even more hostile. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to change the meaning of what Congress understood sex to be,\u201d Justice Alito told the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney.\n\nAnd yet, to the surprise of many, Justice Gorsuch agreed that when a person is fired because of their sexual orientation, their sex is at least a \u201ccontributing cause.\u201d That would suggest that Gorsuch is at least sympathetic to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments.\n\nHow to understand this conflict?\n\nIn a sense, the Court\u2019s conservatives are being asked to choose between two different conservative commitments: to textualism on the one hand, and to originalism on the other. Usually the two go hand in hand\u2014but not always, and not in this case.\n\nTextually speaking, the words \u201cbecause of sex\u201d may well apply to what happened to Bostock, Stephens, and the third plaintiff, Donald Zarda. If all that the Court is doing is reading the words on the page\u2014\u201cinterpreting laws as written,\u201d as conservatives like to say\u2014then the plaintiffs might well win.\n\nBut not in terms of originalism. No one is arguing that that was the intention of Congress in 1964, when Title VII was passed. On the contrary, in 1964, stigma against gay people was universal, and the word \u201ctransgender\u201d didn\u2019t even exist. Justice Alito is certainly correct that, in 1964, Congress didn\u2019t mean to include gay or trans people in the law.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to predict how a justice will vote based on the questions they ask at oral argument. Often, justices will make arguments they don\u2019t believe, simply to test those arguments and see if they hold up \u201d\n\nDoes all this mean that Justice Gorsuch will be the swing vote for LGBTQ equality?\n\nDon\u2019t bet on it.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to predict how a justice will vote based on the questions they ask at oral argument. Often, justices will make arguments they don\u2019t believe, simply to test those arguments and see if they hold up. While, in this case, it\u2019s easy to interpret Justice Alito\u2019s hostility and Justice Kagan\u2019s \u201cextremely simple,\u201d Justice Gorsuch\u2019s equivocation could really go either way.\n\nSecond, Justice Gorsuch simply noted the textualist point: on the page, the statute favors the plaintiffs. He didn\u2019t say that textualist point overrules Congress\u2019s intent in 1964, or its refusal to protect gay and trans people since. And he added that ruling for plaintiffs could cause \u201cmassive social upheaval.\u201d\n\nMost importantly, Justice Gorsuch has just published a book, called A Republic, If You Can Keep It, touting the virtues of originalism and respect for the will of Congress. The book is practically a manifesto for the \u201coriginal intent\u201d method of interpreting laws\u2014which would doom the plaintiffs\u2019 cases.\n\nSo, no, it\u2019s unlikely that Justice Gorsuch will be the new Justice Antony Kennedy. Nor are LGBTQ advocates looking to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was mostly silent during the oral arguments, or Justice Clarence Thomas, who was home with the flu.\n\nUltimately, when these cases are decided\u2014anywhere from three to eight months from now, based on the Court's calendar\u2014they will likely be misunderstood, which is exactly what the Right wants.\n\nIn reality, the cases are about what a law means\u2014not what it should mean, not what some other law should mean, but what Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 says about LGBTQ people.\n\nBut social conservatives want the cases to ask a broader question: \u201cShould it be legal to fire gay and trans people?\u201d They want this to be a referendum on the legality and morality of homophobia. And if they win, as now seems likely, that\u2019s exactly how they will spin it.\n\nThere\u2019s reason to believe that strategy will backfire, however.\n\nThe Supreme Court may, of course, rule in favor of the three fired LGBTQ employees. But even if they lose these cases, the truth will become better known; and those standing in the way of the Equality Act\u2014including Mitch McConnell\u2014will be held accountable.\n\nToday appears unlikely to bring justice to Aimee Stephens, Gerald Bostock, and Donald Zarda.
