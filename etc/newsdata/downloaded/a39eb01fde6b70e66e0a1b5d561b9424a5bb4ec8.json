Nearly all of the NBA\u2019s Chinese sponsors suspended ties with the league after commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement supporting Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression, while apologizing to Chinese who were offended by the content of Morey\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge how the league handled the situation. I just think that, when you\u2019re misinformed or you\u2019re not educated about something \u2013 and I\u2019m just talking about the tweet itself \u2013 you never know the ramifications that can happen,\u201d James told reporters on Monday night back in Los Angeles. \u201cWe all see what that did, not only did for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through that things that you say that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. I think that\u2019s just a prime example of that.\u201d\n\nWhile Morey\u2019s tweet initial drew a public rebuke from Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, he has not faced any team or league discipline over his post. Morey later attempted to clarify his actions on Twitter, noting that he \u201cdid not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockers fans and friends of mine in China.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers and Brooklyn Nets played a pair of exhibition games in China just days after the local backlash against Morey\u2019s remarks began. The Chinese government mandated that NBA officials cancel media availability for players, as well as Silver\u2019s scheduled press conference, ahead of the game in Shanghai last Thursday.\n\nSilver held a tense meeting with Lakers and Nets players during the league\u2019s trip to Shanghai, with some expressing frustration that they were placed at the center of the situation, according to multiple reports.\n\nJames said he has opted not to address the NBA\u2019s ongoing crisis in China because he was not adequately informed on the political climate there.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cYou guys know when I speak about something, I speak about something I\u2019m very knowledgeable about, something that hits home for me, somethings I\u2019m very passionate about,\u201d James said. \u201cI felt that with this particular situation, it was something not only was I not informed enough about, I just felt like it was something that not only myself and my teammates and our organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time.\u201d", "description": "James said he has opted not to address the NBA\u2019s ongoing crisis in China because he was not adequately informed on the political climate there.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/12/0/0/LeBron-James-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
