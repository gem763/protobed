Nevils\u2019 complaint led to Lauer being fired in 2017 amid the Me Too movement. Nevils\u2019 identity was not publicly known then, and it was only reported at the time that Lauer had been accused of assaulting a network staffer at the 2014 Olympics.\n\n\u201cYou know someone, you feel like you know them inside and out,\u201d Kotb said on air. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, a door opens up and it\u2019s a part of them you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nLauer denied the allegation in a letter released Wednesday, saying he and Nevils had a consensual affair that began during the Sochi Olympics.\n\n\u201cIn a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault,\u201d he wrote in the letter, which was published by Variety. \u201cIt is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\u201d\n\nKotb said the allegations against Lauer were serious and \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know all of the facts in all of this, but these are not allegations of an affair. They\u2019re allegations of a crime,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s shocking to all of us here who have sat with Matt for many, many years.\u201d\n\nGuthrie acknowledged that it must not have been easy for Nevils to come forward with her allegation in 2017 or to decide to publicly reveal her identity. She said she and Kotb fully supported her.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling horrific and reprehensible and we said at the time that\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint,\u201d NBC News said in a statement. \u201cOur hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d", "description": "Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb seemed stunned to learn their former colleague had been accused of rape.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ddaf02100003d07acbc8b.png?cache=maciemcmah&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
