The crew rapidly switches between Spanish and another language \u2013 but it is not English, the international language of hip-hop.\n\nThe other language is Palenquero, one of the two creole languages native to Colombia. There are 68 indigenous languages in the country, and many of them are under threat of going extinct from \u201cpressure to assimilate\u201d or Colombia\u2019s long-running internal conflict with drug cartels and paramilitary forces.\n\nPalenquero traces its linguistic roots to the Bantu language family native to sub-Saharan Africa, and includes influence from several romance languages as well. It is centuries old, and hip-hop might help it survive further into the 21st Century.\n\n\u201cAt one point, Palenquero was considered poorly spoken Spanish, and because of that, people felt bad and decided not to speak it,\u201d says Padilla Julio, who goes by the name Afro Netto. A grassroots revival in the latter half of the 20th Century sought to fight these negative stereotypes while at the same time re-establishing the language among the town\u2019s roughly 3,500 inhabitants.\n\nSimilarly, Kombilesa Mi places an emphasis on language and identity through its music, partly making Palenquero words and phrases accessible to audiences. \u201cIf we want people to learn how to say goodbye, we do it by singing, adding some rhythm, and people enjoy that,\u201d says Padilla Julia. This common didactic approach also explains why, for Padilla Julio, hip-hop is such a natural foundation for a rap version of folkl\u00f3rico palenquero: \u201cWith hip-hop, people can dance but they also listen, and since I\u2019m interested in delivering a message... hip-hop allows me to do that and that\u2019s why I love it.\u201d\n\nAdapting the rhythmic elements of hip-hop to traditional Palenque music and instruments cements it into the community. Though ultimately, it is hip-hop\u2019s legacy as a form of social protest that gives rap folkl\u00f3rico palenquero its sense of immediacy. \u201cPeople see in us [Kombilesa Mi] that courage, that voice of support, that voice of protest, struggle,\u201d adds Padilla Julio. \u201cAnd the way that we\u2019re using hip-hop, we\u2019re not just protesting, but making ourselves stronger, too.\u201d This is important given both the social context and history of San Basilio de Palenque, a town of 3500 people at the base of the Montes de Mar\u00eda and the home of Kombilesa Mi.\n\nFor centuries, San Basilio de Palenque has been a symbol of resistance, one that manifests in its language, culture, and identity\n\nKombilesa Mi (\u201cmy friends\u201d in Palenquero) was formed in 2011 and boasts nine members. The group released their debut album As\u00ed es Palenque in 2016, recording in San Basilio de Palenque\u2019s first and only music studio. Along the way, they\u2019ve forged relationships with Afro-Colombian groups doing similar work in other cities across Colombia, such as Rostros Urbanos in Buenaventura and Son Bat\u00e1 in Medell\u00edn. Kombilesa Mi also has a strong presence, says Padilla Julio, among the Palenque diaspora in the capital Bogot\u00e1. In addition, the group has toured abroad, establishing rap folkl\u00f3rico palenquero not just as a musical genre, but a broader social movement connecting past to present for audiences both inside and outside Palenque.\n\nFor centuries, San Basilio de Palenque has been a symbol of resistance, one that shines through in its language, culture, and identity. The small town is known historically as the first free settlement in the Americas; escaped African slaves bound for Colombian plantations settled the town in the 17th Century and were granted their freedom in perpetuity in the 18th Century after nearly a century of fighting Spanish colonialists. It's the only settlement of its kind that survives into the present.\n\nAs a result, In 2005, Unesco recognised San Basilio de Palenque by adding it to the List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Kombilesa Mi have dedicated themselves to preserving this legacy, in the same way it was passed on to the group\u2019s members. \u201cThat\u2019s what our teachers used to tell us, that Palenque culture goes from generation to generation,\u201d says Padilla Julio.\n\nOn Tuesdays and Thursdays, for example, workshops on language, hairstyling, and community identity are held. On the remaining weekdays, the groups offers music and dance classes. \u201cWe do this so that the kids can grow up with a solid identity,\u201d says Guillermo Camacho, manager of Kombilesa Mi. \u201cOur work is to strengthen Palenquero identity through music and language has always been an element that\u2019s allowed us to strengthen our community.\u201d The group also works on community murals, which often feature phrases in Palenquero.\n\nThis is what the town\u2019s residents have been looking for a long time \u2013 Padilla Julio\n\nRap folkl\u00f3rico palenquero is at the heart of these initiatives. As such, hip-hop has been embraced into the community in a big way, especially among the youth, says Padilla Julio. This, he explains, is a byproduct of its fusion with Palenque culture and tradition rather than prior attempts to imitate hip-hop from other countries, such as Venezuela, Cuba, or the United States. Above all, rap folkl\u00f3rico palenquero has helped the community learn that hip-hop is a genre that encourages its listeners to \u201craise your voice and protest\u201d.\n\nFor Camacho, this ability to question the status quo resonates with the lives of Palenque speakers, from poor water and electric systems to cultural appropriation. \u201cWhat does it mean to be free when you don\u2019t have access to education, to healthcare, to good jobs?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat does freedom mean when they discriminate against you because of the colour of your skin?\u201d\n\nThough longstanding, these systemic issues \u2013 to an extent \u2013 are magnified following the 2016 peace accords, which ended a 52-year insurgency by guerrilla rebels from the left-wing Farc (. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t just the guerrilla,\u201d says Camacho. There are other forms of violence wrought against the community, racism and discrimination notwithstanding. Camacho adds that the ongoing murder of social activists and leaders in Afro and Indigenous communities \u2013 hundreds since the 2016 deal \u2013 is nothing new. \u201cIt\u2019s better to take away our path, because we are awakening other communities, other leaders,\u201d says Padilla Julio. That is why music has become such a powerful tool.\n\nKombilesa Mi are currently preparing for the release of their second album, entitled Esa Palenquera. A celebration of women and their contributions to Palenque, the album was recorded in the mountains of Minca, at the studio of producer Cristi\u00e1n Casta\u00f1o.\n\nThe change of scenery coincided with an overall shift to a more organic sound. There are no guitars, nor digital instruments, just rap folkl\u00f3rico palenquero in its purest form, with tracks named for traditional dances such as Mapal\u00e9 and Pica Pica, or a popular traditional beverage in the case of \u00d1eque. Others, such as No M\u00e1s Siscriminaci\u00f3n, carry an explicit social message. Los Peinados, in turn, takes a didactic approach, instructing the listener on the history of routes braided into the hair of escaped slaves, with a reference to Los Montes de Mar\u00eda where the first palenque settlements were established.\n\nIn the end, each of these kinds of tracks fulfills the purpose of rap folkl\u00f3rico palenquero. \u201cThis is what the town\u2019s residents have been looking for a long time,\u201d says Padilla Julio, \u201ca way for the younger generation to guarantee, in part, the future of San Basilio de Palenque\u2019s traditions.\u201d\n\nMore on BBC Music\u2019s greatest hip-hop songs of all time:\n\nThe 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time\n\nWhat critics had to say about the top 10\n\nFull list of critics who participated \u2013 and how they voted\n\nTrends and surprises in the poll (not available in UK)\n\nWhy are there so few women in hip-hop polls?\n\nPlaylist of the top 25 songs (Spotify)", "description": "In Colombia\u2019s historic town of San Basilio de Palenque, hip-hop is helping resurrect a local language in danger of dying out.", "authors": ["N David Pastor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/v3/p07rv3kz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
