Earnings above the $5 billion will then be spent drought mitigation measures.\n\nMr Littleproud couldn't say how much money had gone out of federal coffers so far, but said the $7 billion was budgeted and relied on demand-driven projects.\n\n\"Our commitment is about having an amount there to support these communities get through this drought. They will be taken up as they are required,\" he said.\n\n\"We're very proud of the fact this federal government has stood shoulder to shoulder with farmers and regional communities to make sure we are keeping them going through this drought.\n\n\"We have nothing to hide. we are happy to put numbers out. We are so proud of the fact that we have stood shoulder to shoulder and we hope that the state governments will do the same things.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe opposition has demanded the government release the report of drought coordinator-general Stephen Day and communications including text messages between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Mr Joyce about the former Nationals leader's drought work.\n\nThis week Mr Morrison ordered government ministers to visit and listen to communities struggling with drought.\n\nLabor leader Anthony Albanese visited Stanthorpe in south-east Queensland on Wednesday, visiting the struggling Storm King Dam.\n\nMeeting with local councillors, Mr Albanese slammed the Coalition for failing to build any new dams in more than six years in government.\n\n\"They need to narrow the gap that's there between the government's rhetoric and its actions on so many issues,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a government that has a political tactic for everything and a long-term strategy for nothing. This is a government that isn't acting in the national interest. It just acts on a day-by-day basis in its own political interest.\"", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg began a three-day drought tour of northern NSW and Queensland on Wednesday, calling on city folk to holiday in regional Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_24/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6c2d03520fac377b22757d4c9ea06efd9372e07b", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
