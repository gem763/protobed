(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Redskins, still seeking their first win of 2019, host the Chicago Bears Monday night. Follow along here for live updates.\n\nWashington Redskins (0-2) vs. Chicago Bears (1-1)\n\nWhen: 8:15 p.m.\n\nWhere: FedEx Field, Landover, Md.\n\nTV: ESPN.\n\nStreaming: WatchESPN.\n\nRadio: 630, 980 AM; 92.7, 94.3, 105.9 FM.\n\nLine: Bears by 5\u00bd.\n\nPregame reading\n\nThe Redskins need a win to avoid falling to 0-3 for the first time since 2013, and it won\u2019t come easy against the defending NFC North champions. Chicago, which boasted the league\u2019s third-ranked defense a year ago in Coach Matt Nagy\u2019s first season at the helm, has allowed 24 points through two games. Bears pass rusher Khalil Mack could make life difficult for inexperienced left guard Ereck Flowers and quarterback Case Keenum, who will be will be without tight end Jordan Reed for a third consecutive week after he suffered a concussion during the preseason. Washington, which didn\u2019t have any success running the ball in losses to Philadelphia and Dallas, may not find the going any easier against a Chicago unit that\u2019s allowed 68.5 rushing yards per game.\n\nThe good news for Washington, which has won seven straight against the Bears, is that Chicago\u2019s offense represents an opportunity for Greg Manusky\u2019s struggling defense to get right after allowing 63 points and more than 900 yards through two weeks. The Bears have converted only 23 percent of their third-down opportunities this season, while Washington has allowed opponents to convert at a league-worst 64 percent rate. Chicago has the league\u2019s third-worst offense in terms of yards, while third-year quarterback Mitch Trubisky has yet to throw a touchdown pass. The Redskins\u2019 pass rush, which has two sacks this season, could receive a boost with the expected return of defensive lineman Jonathan Allen, who missed last week\u2019s game with a sprained knee.\n\nThe Redskins are looking to snap a seven-game losing streak on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d dating back to an overtime win at Dallas in 2014. Washington is 2-16 on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d at home since FedEx Field opened in 1997, while the Bears are 9-6 in Monday night road games during that span. Another loss would be a major blow to the Redskins\u2019 postseason hopes before the calendar turns to October. Before this year, 176 NFL teams started a season 0-3 since 1980, and only six of them went on to make the playoffs.\n\nIn a pivotal season, Redskins Coach Jay Gruden has ramped up the intensity.\n\nPlayers say Gruden has brought a greater sense of urgency to practices, film sessions and games this season, his sixth in Washington, but the coach says he\u2019s no more serious than he has always been.

With Derrius Guice on injured reserve following surgery to repair a torn meniscus, expect the Redskins to get the ball in the hands of Chris Thompson and rookie wide receiver Steven Sims Jr. out of the backfield to complement Adrian Peterson\u2019s straight-ahead running style.

I\u2019m going to tell you how they\u2019re going to attack us.
