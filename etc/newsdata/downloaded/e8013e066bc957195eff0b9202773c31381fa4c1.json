Photo: Salwan Georges/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nAfter months of clamoring for more attention from the political media, Andrew Yang is finally starting to get it. It\u2019s not clear though that this is what he had in mind.\n\nIn the days since last week\u2019s Democratic debate, a handful of reporters have written about the varied reactions to Yang\u2019s jokes about being Asian. Among the one-liners:\n\n\u201cNow, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m Asian, so you know I love to work.\u201d\n\nHis campaign gear plays it up too. There are hats that read \u201cMATH,\u201d buttons that refer to Yang as \u201cThe Man, The Math, The Legend,\u201d and calculators with his name printed on them.\n\nClearly, there\u2019s an audience for this. Yang has surprised many with his popularity among Democratic primary voters, and he\u2019s been praised by some Asian-Americans for his wisecracks. But Yang has also been criticized for advancing harmful stereotypes about Asians by \u201cobtusely reinforcing the model-minority myth.\u201d His jokes have been referred to as \u201cdangerous and exploitative.\u201d He\u2019s been called just plain hacky.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Asian-Americans who are demeaned by Yang\u2019s language and the model-minority myth, Indiana University\u2019s Ellen Wu told the Washington Post. \u201cThe biggest risk in my mind is \u2026 the work that this stereotype does to dehumanize, to criminalize African-Americans,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Andrew Yang himself is doing this but that the larger cultural work, political work of this stereotype that\u2019s been around since the 1950s and \u201960s has functioned in upholding assumptions about African-Americans.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, in an interview with Politico, the entrepreneur and universal-basic-income advocate said he\u2019s heard the criticism and he doesn\u2019t plan to stop telling jokes on the stump. \u201cWe\u2019re a very diverse community, and if Asian Americans disagree with my response to a particular issue, or a joke I tell, that\u2019s something I would expect and accept,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to dramatically change anything I\u2019ve been doing to date.\u201d", "description": "Despite criticism of his jokes about Asian-Americans, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang says he doesn\u2019t plan to change anything about what he\u2019s doing.", "authors": ["Adam K.
