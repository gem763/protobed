The difference here, though, is that I think that there\u2019s a combination of internal rifts together with the public mood swing. And now internally, they can\u2019t control the police or the army too much Egyptian activist\n\nOne Egyptian analyst and journalist with strong contacts within the security forces told The Independent he had been alerted days earlier by a former military intelligence official that a scheme was brewing, with discontent over Mr Sisi\u2019s style and tactics alienating even those within the security apparatus.\n\nSuch machinations within the intelligence and security branches predated the 2013 protests that ousted Egypt\u2019s elected Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.\n\n\u201cIt would be crazy to consider what\u2019s happening here to be an organic uprising,\u201d said the analyst, who asked to remain anonymous.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re speaking about a guy who\u2019s come from nowhere and suddenly he\u2019s giving orders and suddenly protests start. We\u2019re seeing a fight between themselves, within the ranks of the senior generals and intelligence officials.\u201d\n\nBut Egyptians have also been seething with anger against the ruling establishment for years, enraged by perceptions of widespread corruption, diminishing economic prospects, and stifled political freedoms. In 2018 presidential elections several candidates from within the armed forces sought to run against Mr Sisi, though they were eventually thwarted by a combination of threats and jailings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen small waves of opposition building up to this,\u201d said Ms Dunne. \u201cThere is opposition to him. Popular anger is high. Who are his friends? He\u2019s got some people within the military who are benefiting, but the middle classes are hurting.\u201d\n\nOne Cairo-based Egyptian activist described surging hostility towards Mr Sisi in marketplaces and businesses over both the country\u2019s financial troubles and the president\u2019s style, in which he often chastises Egyptians for not being frugal or hard-working enough.\n\n\u201cPeople cannot stand Sisi, and this has been happening for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difference here, though, is that I think that there\u2019s a combination of internal rifts together with the public mood swing. And now internally, they can\u2019t control the police or the army too much.\u201d\n\nEgyptian authorities sought to downplay the unrest. As the protests continued, Mr Sisi departed for New York to attend meetings at the annual United Nations General Assembly gathering.\n\nHis speech will focus on counterterrorism and combating extremism, according to an official close to local press accounts, as he attempts to lure US investments in private meetings with business leaders.\n\nGauging popular support for the protests remained difficult. Tightly controlled state and private television channels in Egypt described the protesters as children of imprisoned members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the outlawed Islamist political organisation whose elected president Mr Sisi deposed in 2013 when he took power.\n\nOne pro-government TV correspondent warned that the protest footage aired on international channels sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood was fabricated, and admonished viewers not to blindly heed protest calls.\n\nThe State Information Service, without mentioning the protests, urged international journalists not to disseminate news based on social media accounts and to \u201conly publish what they observe themselves from their known, credible sources that must be confirmed by two other credible sources that have also observed the same incidents with their own eyes\u201d.\n\nAnwar Gargash, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates which strongly backs the Sisi regime, accused the Muslim Brotherhood of being behind the protests and spreading news about them and insisting that there is \u201cgenuine popular support for the Egyptian state and its institutions\u201d.\n\nStill, remnants of the political groups that once flowered in Egypt following the 2011 uprising which toppled longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak voiced support. \u201cSisi\u2019s departure is no longer an impossible dream, but rather it has become closer than ever,\u201d the Revolutionary Socialists Movement wrote in a Facebook posting, saying the demonstrations had \u201crestored hope to the millions who were desperate.\u201d\n\nEgypt\u2019s Social Democratic Party, which controversially supported the 2013 coup by Sisi before he cracked down on the group demanded citizens be allowed to \u201cexercise their constitutional and legal right to peaceful demonstration\u201d.\n\nThose watching Egypt closely say Mr Sisi has been unable to broaden his base of his support, and his efforts to entrust duties to his son, has irked both the public and the elite. Under Mr Sisi he has increasingly also handing segments of the economy to allies, shutting out once-powerful oligarchs from lucrative sectors as varied as concrete production to pharmaceutical importation.\n\n\u201cHe trusts very few people and that\u2019s why he\u2019s obviously handing power to his son,\u201d said Amr Magdy, Egypt researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cSuch moves are not just unpleasant to ordinary people, but also to the people in power.\u201d", "description": "An exiled businessman whose accusations of corruption sparked the most widespread protests in Egypt in years has called for further demonstrations, as the country\u2019s autocratic president arrived in New York to meet with other world leaders.
