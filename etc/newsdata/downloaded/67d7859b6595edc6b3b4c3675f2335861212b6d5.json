POLITICO's own poll of polls shows that in a hypothetical second referendum, 50 percent would vote Remain and 44 percent Leave, with the rest undecided.\n\nOn the role of the queen, half of respondents said she should not intervene to remove Johnson if he has no deal in place by October 19 and fails to ask for an extension, with 35 percent saying the monarch should intervene and 14 percent unsure. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay on Wednesday said that Johnson will comply with the Benn Act, which forces him to request an extension to Brexit negotiations if no deal is reached by October 19.\n\nThe survey was carried out between October 2 and 14, and involved 26,000 British adults.", "description": "Most British people favour abiding by the 2016 Brexit referendum result and leaving the EU.", "authors": ["Louise Guillot", "Madalina Ciulin"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176018622-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
