REUTERS/Lisa Baertlein\n\nUnited Parcel Service Inc on Wednesday announced plans to buy more than 6,000 natural gas-powered trucks over three years and step up purchases of renewable natural gas (RNG) as part of a new $450 million investment to reduce the environmental impact of its 123,000-vehicle fleet.\n\nThe latest move from the world\u2019s largest package delivery firm comes as utility companies, investors and others seek to expand the use of RNG - which is derived from decomposing organic matter such as cow manure on dairy farms, discarded food in landfills and human waste in water treatment plants - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nRNG and natural gas from fossil fuel are both methane and can be used interchangeably. Natural gas vehicles are less polluting than those that run on unleaded gasoline or diesel, but RNG has the added benefits of replacing fossil fuel and preventing naturally occurring methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - from being released into the environment.\n\nUPS\u2019s latest effort \u201callows for seamless integration of a truly renewable, organic fuel source into the fleet,\u201d Mike Whitlatch, UPS\u2019s vice president of global energy and procurement, told Reuters.\n\nUPS expects to use 31.9 million gasoline gallon equivalents (GGE) of RNG this year. As of this month, it has agreed to purchase 230 million GGE of RNG over the next seven years, a commitment that UPS says makes it the transportation industry\u2019s largest user of RNG.\n\n\u201cWe provide one large-single user to help de-risk (RNG) projects,\u201d Whitlatch said of UPS.\n\nThe Atlanta-based company\u2019s new vehicle purchases will begin next year and add to the roughly 10,000 alternative fuel or advanced technology delivery vehicles already in use by UPS.\n\nNorway-based Hexagon Composites\u2019 Agility Fuel Solutions will equip UPS\u2019s new brown delivery trucks, semi trucks and terminal tractors to run on natural gas.\n\nUPS customer and rival Amazon.com Inc last month pledged to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from startup Rivian Automotive LLC and have them all on the road by 2024. Amazon\u2019s independent delivery partners currently use about 30,000 conventional fuel vans.\n\nUPS\u2019s fleet of planes and trucks created 14.6 million metric tonnes of CO2e, a standard unit for measuring carbon footprints, while moving 5.2 billion packages in 2018.\n\nAmazon, which has not yet released data on its carbon footprint, last month said it would be net carbon neutral by 2040.", "description": "Starting next year, there will be a lot more \"green\" in those brown UPS delivery trucks.", "authors": ["Lisa Baertlein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438843627&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9817R", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
