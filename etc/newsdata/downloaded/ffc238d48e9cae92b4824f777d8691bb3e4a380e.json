That happens for a variety of reasons, LinkedIn Career Expert Blair Decembrele tells MarketWatch \u2014 with nearly half of hiring managers (45%) in a recent LinkedIn survey saying they hire then because October is a busy season so they need more help then, 32% saying that the company is growing and they need to fill open roles before year end, and 28% saying that\u2019s when they\u2019ve just finished planning budgets for the year ahead.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the No. 1 day for hiring managers to post opportunities is on a Monday \u2014 and the earlier you apply for the job (being among the first 25 candidates is especially beneficial) the more likely it is that you land that job, LinkedIn found.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s all data you\u2019ll want to take in if you\u2019re looking for a new job this year \u2014 as is the fact that job seekers may make big errors when they apply and when they get an interview. These range from poor grammar on a resume to being late.\n\n\n\nThe biggest potential deal breaker, according to hiring managers, is tardiness to the interview. Indeed, more than nine in 10 (93%) of hiring managers say that arriving late to an interview negatively affects the likelihood that they will hire you, according to a 2018 survey of 850 hiring managers by SimplyHired.com. That\u2019s followed closely by whining (92% say its a turn off that could keep you from getting hired) and a lack of preparation (89%) as the 10 worst interview and application mistakes job applicants make.\n\n10 worst job interview and application mistakes\n\nPercentage of hiring managers who say it has a negative effect on whether they will hire you Arriving late to an interview 93% Whining 92% Showing lack of preparation 89% Bad-mouthing a former boss 88% Bad-mouthing a former company 87% Making grammar or spelling mistakes on a cover letter 86% Using poor grammar in an interview 84% Having unrealistic compensation requirements 84% Being underqualified 80% Answering questions incorrectly 77%\n\nSource: SimplyHired\n\nWilliam Vanderbloemen, the CEO and founder of Vanderbloemen Search Group who has interviewed thousands of candidates over the past decade, says that he\u2019s seen lateness cost plenty of candidates the job. \u201cAt its root, an [interview] appointment is a contract between you and me. And if you cannot keep this very first contract we have, especially when you're trying to impress me, tells me that you'll likely not be able to deliver on any other contract I entrust you with if you were on my team,\u201d he explains.\n\nOf course, lateness happens sometimes \u2014 as does finding yourself whining and being wholly unprepared for a question an interviewer asks of you. SoMarketWatchh asked career experts what to do when you find yourself in one of these three majorly compromising positions.\n\nYou\u2019re running late. \u201cIf you find that you are going to be late to your interview, call in as soon as possible to let your interviewer know and explain your situation,\u201d says Ann Vu Ngo, a career coach at Ama La Vida Coaching. What\u2019s more, \u201cyou need a good excuse, such as traffic was much heavier than expected because of a major accident on the road,\u201d says Call to Career founder Cheryl Palmer. \u201cIt\u2019s best to take the phone number of the organization with you so that you will have the number to call in case of an emergency. Once you get to the interview, you will need to apologize for running late and give a brief explanation.\u201d\n\nYou start whining. \u201cPeople don't own their mistakes (like being late), and often end up whining about what has happened to them,\u201d says Vanderbloemen \u2014 which he adds is a big mistake as people should own up to errors and \u201ctalk about what they have learned from their mistakes.\u201d Palmer says that to avoid whining, \u201cyou should practice the answers to standard interview questions ahead of time.\u201d And practice pivoting if do find yourself whining, she adds: \u201cYou might be whining because you were treated unfairly on the job. Do a quick pivot and talk about how you were able to overcome obstacles at work. Talk about some of the accomplishments that you have. That way you can end on a positive note.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re unprepared for a question they ask you. \u201cDon\u2019t panic. And don\u2019t lie,\u201d says NYC-based career strategist Carolta Zimmerman. \u201dSmile and say something such as, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a really unique question, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever been asked anything like that before\u2019.\u201d Or, advises Palmer, \u201cbuy yourself a few seconds by repeating the question. You can also say, \u2018Let me see,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s an interesting question.\u2019 And, adds, Ngo, you can ask for a minute to think about your answer.\n\n\u201cThen, answer what you can. Part of what you\u2019re being tested on, is how you respond to challenges. So your answer could be, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve never had to consider that, but I guess I\u2019d\u2026\u2019 and here you can lay out your plan of research and/or attack. A good manager isn\u2019t interested in perfection\u2014which is a fantasy\u2014but reasonable, intellectually curious adults who can rise to a challenge, and meet it,\u201d concludes Zimmerman.\n\n\n\nThis story was updated on Sept. 23, 2019.", "description": "October is the month when the most new job listings are posted, new data shows.
