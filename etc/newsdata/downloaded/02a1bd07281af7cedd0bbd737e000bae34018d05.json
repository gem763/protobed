Certain lower costs, such as amortization of intangible assets and interest expense, helped earnings.\n\nAfter adjustments, the company reported a profit of 84 cents a share, in line with forecasts from analysts.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 16, 2019 08:10 ET (12:10 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
