We got our hands on one, and have a full review and video in the pipeline, but we wanted to get some thoughts down before then. In a\u2026 different way.\n\nThis then, is the acrostic review of the Pixel 4. What\u2019s that? Well, when the first letter of each paragraph will form its OWN REVIEW BY THE END OF THE PIECE. See if you can unravel our tricky, brain-rending riddle. Good luck, friends, good luck.\n\nI think the first thing that struck me about the Pixel 4 is the design. It\u2019s a beautiful looking phone. I\u2019m a big fan of the camera square on the back of the Pixel 4, as it looks so much slicker than the trio of lens holes on the rear of the iPhone 11 Pro range.\n\nSomething else I loved about the Pixel 4 was Google doubling down on its decision to murder the notch. This jutting bit of blackness is a horrendous chapter of phone design, and the quicker it dies, the better \u2014 especially when it was as bad as the Pixel 3. Good riddance.\n\nPerhaps one of the most talked about elements of the Pixel 4 is motion sense. Basically, there are cameras and sensors on the front of the phone that can track hand movements and turn those into commands. You know, like swiping your hand to change tracks. Currently, this is a gimmick with no real use. But I\u2019m hoping that\u2019ll change.\n\nRelated to the Pixel 4\u2019s front cameras is another new element of the phone: face unlocking. Compared to the iPhone, I\u2019ve found the Pixel 4 to unlock quicker, and work better in low light environments. The issue is that it\u2019s nowhere near as secure, with Google allowing your phone to unlocked with your eyes closed by default.\n\nEven though the face unlocking feature is good, I really miss the fingerprint scanner. That was so much quicker and more reliable than this face-scanning nonsense. Plus, loads of Android apps don\u2019t support Google\u2019s face unlock yet, which makes it far less useful than the iPhone.\n\nThe photography is probably the part of the Pixel 4 I\u2019ve probably enjoyed the most. We\u2019ll be running more in-depth pieces on this in the coming weeks, but it really produces some gorgeous shots, with minimal work needed from the photographer.\n\nThe particularly exciting thing is the Pixel 4\u2019s photographs are only going to get better, as much of the heavy lifting is done by software, rather than hardware. So, in six months time, the already impressive results might be even better. Which is terrifyingly cool.\n\nYet, not everything is rosy. Let\u2019s talk about the battery. Google actually reduced the capacity of the Pixel 4 compared to the Pixel 3. Which \u2014 and to put this lightly \u2014 is absolutely fucking insane. At the moment it\u2019s just fine, lasting me about a day of use. But the amount of time you\u2019ll get out of that will drop over time because, you know, batteries. Honestly, I don\u2019t understand what Google was thinking here.\n\nGenerally, the Pixel 4 feels like a premium phone. But\u2026 there\u2019s something about it that doesn\u2019t quite match the price tag. The base model comes in at $799, the same price range you can get souped-up flagships from a company like Huawei. Which, specs-wise, run rings around the Pixel 4. I know you could level the same accusation at Apple\u2019s iPhones, but there\u2019s something about them that feels more premium. They\u2019re weightier, feel more robust, and \u2014 importantly \u2014 have an air of prestige the Pixel doesn\u2019t quite have. Yet.\n\nOf course \u2014 and despite this \u2014 the Pixel 4 is still a damn good phone. It has the cleanest (and best) version of Android around, and, OS-wise, is probably the best future-proofed phone you can get (because Google will keep offering updates for it for some time). And although I might pick an iPhone over the Pixel 4, I can\u2019t really think of an Android device I\u2019d prefer to use day-to-day.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019ve said before that Google\u2019s \u201ca\u201d range of budget phones are the best hardware fit for the company, and I\u2019m excited to see how this pans out with the 4a. But, that doesn\u2019t take anything away from the Pixel 4 currently: it\u2019s a good phone, that\u2019s well designed, but has one too many flaws for it to sit alone at the top of the Android tree \u2014 even though it\u2019s pretty close.\n\nDid you like this acrostic review?
