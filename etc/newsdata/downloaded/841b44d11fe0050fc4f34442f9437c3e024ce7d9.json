My cholesterol is ten times better too, my blood pressure is back to normal now and I\u2019ve also gained muscle by doing upper body exercises and weight training.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tom Cubis)\n\n(Image: Tom Cubis)\n\nSince retiring in 2003 Ruddock diet typically ranged from a fry up for breakfast to Chinese takeaways with plenty of side dishes for dinner.\n\nIn March this year on ITV, Dr Enam Abood told him on the show Harry\u2019s Heroes: \u201cIf I don\u2019t intervene, you are at a risk of having a heart attack and a stroke. Razor, you cannot afford to take this lightly please.\u201d\n\nRuddock, 50, has two daughters aged 11 and eight with wife Leah Newman.\n\nShe is left horrified by the news, saying: \u201cIt was really shocking in there.\n\n\u201cShe basically said he could drop dead at any minute and I\u2019d be on my own with the children. So it\u2019s hit home, what we need to do \u2013 and we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nAt the time Ruddock began to lose wait and said he was ready to make the major changes.\n\nHe said: \u201cMen are scared to get bad news. Both my older brothers have got problems. One\u2019s got a stent. It is in my family.\u201d\n\nNeil is now as active as he\u2019s been since his playing days and has switched to a new, healthy diet.\n\n(Image: Tom Cubis)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThe improvement in fitness from working out and eating better has given him more energy, allowing him to spend extra time with his family and get out of bed earlier.\n\nNeil said: \u201cAfter training pretty much every day of my life for three decades, it\u2019s easy to get unfit and be lazy when you stop playing.\n\n\u201cI miss all the lads but not the training, so taking part in Harry\u2019s Heroes was a real eye opener and helped inspire me to change my lifestyle for better.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I live like a monk though. I\u2019ve cut my drinking and look after myself during the week, but I can still have a couple of pints while watching the football at the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe problem was, I often used to have bacon and eggs or a fry up in the morning and I could never stop at just one main and rice when ordering a takeaway in the evening.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have bread with most meals too, but the calories soon add up if you\u2019re having fifteen or more portions a week. I loved snacking on chocolate, ice cream and anything I could get my hands on too. But now I enjoy lots of veg with every meal.\n\n\u201cI saw Harry Redknapp recently, for the first time since starting the plan, and the first thing he said was, \u2018bloody hell, you look well!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to surprise people I haven\u2019t seen for a while and see the smile on their face. From my mates at the golf club to people on twitter, everyone is saying well done. Even my mum\u2019s said how proud she is of her little soldier.\n\n\u201cI hope I can inspire others to get fit and active, change their diet and have a check-up with a doctor before it\u2019s too late. If I can get healthier, anyone on the planet can.\u201d\n\nNeil has been on a 12 week plan which sees high intensity workouts combined with low calorie and low fat meals which are delivered fresh to your door weekly.\n\nThere are over 100 meals to choose from for breakfast, lunch and dinner plus three snacks each day.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The former footballer, 51, was motivated to lose weight after he was told he could 'die any minute'", "authors": ["Mark Jefferies", "Image", "Tom Cubis", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20686787.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Neil-Ruddock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
