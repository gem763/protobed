Labor organizations grew in size alongside the surging U.S. economy. At one point in the 1950s, 35 percent of all workers in the country were unionized. But union membership dropped precipitously in recent decades; in 2018, only 10.5 percent of U.S. workers were in unions.\n\nIn the past two years, however, there has been a rise in successful union actions across the country. More than 485,000 workers took part in union-led work stoppages last year \u2014 up from 25,000 in 2017 \u2014 largely led by teacher strikes that brought higher wages and changes to classrooms.\n\nAutoworkers recently reached a deal with General Motors for pay increases and other benefits that could soon bring a six-week-long strike to an end.\n\nThe United Auto Workers union voted to ratify an agreement to end a six-week nationwide strike against General Motors, union leaders announced Friday. The deal establishes a bonus for eligible employees and a clearer path to permanent status for full-time temporary workers. Teachers in Chicago have been on strike for more than a week as they seek higher wages and smaller class sizes.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nSome observers see this recent string of union actions as a sign that organized labor is having a resurgence. A strong economy has led to low unemployment, which gives workers more power to make demands of their employers, some argue. Others make the case that growing discontent with increased inequality and a decline in quality of life for the working class \u2014 both trends that coincide with the dwindling of unions \u2014 have turned public sentiment in favor of unions.\n\nOthers are skeptical that unions will recover from the sharp decline they experienced over the past 35 years. Even though high-profile strikes are drawing attention, membership numbers continue to decline and the economic upturn that\u2019s empowering them will inevitably reverse, some say. Labor organizations were also dealt a significant blow in 2018 when the Supreme Court ruled against their ability to compel nonmembers to pay dues.\n\nThere is still strong skepticism of unions among both politicians and workers, some argue, which puts a cap on how much ground they can gain.\n\nPerspectives\n\nMovin\u2019 on up\n\nA strong economy empowers workers.\n\n\u201cAmid the lowest unemployment rate since 1969 and the overall economic boom, workers are feeling emboldened in ways they never did a decade ago.\u201d \u2014 Chris Woodyard, USA Today\n\nSuccessful strikes inspire more workers to take action.\n\n\u201cIn social movements, you see waves of working-class activity as people learn from each other. There\u2019s this idea of the politics of the possible. Most working people aren\u2019t against unions or having more money and benefits, but there\u2019s a risk to doing those things. But as more and more of these things happen and people win, then more people get on board.\u201d \u2014 Labor expert Josh Murray to Washington Post\n\nUnion growth will have a snowball effect.\n\n\u201cA rise in unionized jobs would lead more workers to see the benefits of unions. And a greater number of workers in unions would increase their political clout, making it more difficult for politicians to cross them and neglect the interests of workers.\u201d \u2014 Conor Sen, Bloomberg\n\nProminent progressive politicians could bring legislative changes that bolster unions.\n\n\u201cDemocratic presidential candidates such as Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, and Beto O\u2019Rourke have already released strong, detailed plans that would make it easier for millions of workers to join together on the job.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mary Kay Henry, The Hill\n\nWorkers recognize that unions can help reverse inequality.\n\n\u201cThe strong public opinion behind these strikes can be tied to Americans\u2019 widespread dismay with wage stagnation and income inequality, even as corporate profits are flying high. While job numbers and economic growth are strong, many American are barely getting by.\u201d \u2014 Steven Greenhouse, New York Times\n\nLimit to power\n\nUnions have fallen too far to ever recover.\n\n\u201cThere is some evidence that unions are regrouping. But they do so from a weakened position, with fewer members and diminished revenues.\u201d \u2014 Thomas B.
