The cabinet also approved on Monday a 2020 state budget that does not impose new taxes on people and aims for a deficit of 0.6 percent of total economic output, down from a previous target of about 7 percent.\n\nCommercial banks and the central bank are set to contribute to the deficit reduction with 5.1 trillion Lebanese pounds ($3.4bn), including through a tax hike on bank profits.\n\nLebanon has the world's third heaviest public debt burden, at some 150 percent of total economic output. The unemployment rate among those aged 35 and under is 37 percent, while remittances - a key source of foreign income - have started to dry up.\n\nForeign donors and investors last year pledged $11bn to help Lebanon finance a capital investment programme, as long as it enacts reforms.\n\n\"We wanted to send a very clear message that Lebanon is serious about handling its budget deficit,\" Munla said. He said this would hopefully lead to \"a very positive development in the markets\" and an increase in foreign direct investment.\n\nHe said the forecast deficit cut would come from reducing spending, including power subsidies, debt servicing costs and capital expenditures. Munla added that 0 percent economic growth was expected in 2020.\n\nHe said some political factions had called for a cabinet reshuffle, an idea which would be determined in the coming days. But he said the move has not yet reached a level of serious debate or come from Hariri.\n\n\"Restoring (people's) confidence will be an uphill battle,\" he said regarding the protests.", "description": "To unlock billions pledged at a donor conference last year, Lebanese government must show donors it is cutting spending.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/7fd162a8dc804481a76f3a1767da804f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
