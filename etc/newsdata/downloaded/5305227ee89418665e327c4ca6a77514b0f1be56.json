If Trump went too far in that regard, we could look with disfavor on that while realizing that he would not be the first president to have done so. And if, alternatively, the president had a good reason for making a reciprocal commitment to Ukraine, that commitment would not become improper just because, collaterally, it happened to help Trump or harm Biden politically.\n\nThis is a good example of what David Hume called \u201cthe calm sunshine of the mind,\u201d and I like to see it. I wish it were in evidence more broadly.\n\nYou won\u2019t find that calm sunshine anywhere near the revving outrage machine of the anti-Trump media or the clown car precincts of the U.S. House of Representatives. Nope, for the next week or so, until it collapses on the miasma of its own fatuousness, expect screaming headlines and stories by Max Boot asking, \u201cIs Trump finally finished?\u201d\n\nStepping back for a moment from that snarling imbroglio, I do wonder whether the latest \u201cTrump abused his powers, let\u2019s impeach him!\u201d gambit is not rather an impressive deployment of a rhetorical-political gambit known as the \u201cpreemptive tu quoque I-tagged-you-first\u201d strategy.
