Carbon- ceramic brakes are also offered for the first time.\n\nWILL IT FIT IN MY GARAGE? Bentley Bentayga V8 petrol SUV Price: From \u00a3136,200.

I completed figure eights around the mountainside circuit like an ice-skater and felt totally at ease \u2013 even in \u2018Sport\u2019 mode.\n\nThere was some satisfying slip on the tight curves \u2013 just to keep things interesting - but then the car\u2019s safety systems kicked in to supplement the permanent four-wheel drive.\n\nHowever, I also had a go with the traction control switched off to do some really touchy-feely drifting on the ice and snow circuit. Maybe they should make it an Olympic sport.\n\nTo mark out the lithe 32-valve V8 petrol version and target younger buyers, blingy exterior chrome makes way for a more menacing gloss black trim and grille, with glossy carbon fibre interior and carbon-ceramic brakes also offered for the first time. My V8 was on 21 inch wheels (you can order 22 inch) with winter tyres.\n\nCosseted in sumptuous leather seats and riding high for a great view, the all terrain Bentley is comfortable and refined\n\nHyundai reveals hydrogen-powered prototype\n\nPut the kettle on.\n\nHyundai's prototype self driving, zero-emission, Nexo fuel-cell car uses a chemical reaction with hydrogen to generate the electricity to drive its motor.\n\nThe only by-product is water from its exhaust, which, the Korean car maker says, could be stored to brew tea or water plants.\n\nHyundai's Nexo fuel-cell car uses hydrogen to generate electricity to drive its motor\n\nPorsche axes all diesels\n\nAnother nail in diesel's coffin this week \u2014 Porsche announced it is axing all diesel options from its range because of a 'cultural shift' that means 'demand for diesel models is falling'.\n\nIt intends to concentrate on petrol and hybrid options.", "description": "British luxury car maker Bentley took to the Tyrolean slopes with its new V8 Bentayga 4x4, which it's fitted Bentley's king of the snow! with an impressive new 4-litre twin-turbo petrol engine.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
