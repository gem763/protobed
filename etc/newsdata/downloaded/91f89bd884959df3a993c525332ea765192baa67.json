European indices largely closed higher on hopes the European Central Bank (ECB) will reveal an interest rate cut on Thursday, and there is speculation about a stimulus package too.\n\n\n\nThe ECB has the motivation to loosening monetary policy. Germany is the powerhouse of Europe and the economy contracted in the second quarter, and there is the talk of a recession. The Fed already cut interest rates in June, and there is speculation about a further cut later this month, so the ECB might want to make the first move. Given that the base rate is 0%, and the deposit rate is -0.4%, the bank might not want to move just yet, as they might wish to hold fire in case things get a lot worse.\n\n\n\nUS equity markets were a mixed bunch as the Dow Jones registered a small gain, the S&P 500 was essentially flat, and the NASDAQ 100 ended the day slightly in the red. A lack of major macroeconomic news led to a relatively small trading range in US markets.\n\n\n\nSterling saw low volatility yesterday despite good economic reports from the UK. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.8%, which is on par with levels of unemployment in the mid-1970. Average wages, excluding bonuses, cooled to 3.8% from 3.9%. People are jobs, and they are getting a decent increase in wages. Judging by retail updates in recent months, it is clear that some people are curtailing their spending on account of Brexit.\n\n\n\nFor much of yesterday, the oil market was driving higher as the energy\u2019s bullish run was extended. The new Saudi energy minister expressed hope the OPEC+ oil production cuts would stay in place. The positive move was interrupted when President Trump fired John Bolton as the national security adviser. Traders took the view that an US-Iran war seems less likely now that Mr. Bolton has left the Trump administration, and that triggered a decline in the energy market.\n\n\n\nGold tumbled yesterday as traders trimmed their positions in the commodity. The metal was one of a number of safe havens that benefitted from the turmoil in stock markets at the height of the recent US-China trade spat. Now that the fear factor has cooled a little, we saw a drop in gold.\n\n\n\nAt 1.30pm (UK time) US PPI will be posted. The headline reading is tipped to behold steady at 1.7%, and the core reading is expected to edge up to 2.2% from 2.1%. The core reading is deemed to be a better gauge of underlying demand at the factory level, and it might give us an indication about CPI in the months to come.\n\n\n\nAt 3.30pm (UK time) the Energy Information Administration report will be posted, and the consensus estimate is for US oil stockpiles to drop by 2.6 million barrels, and gasoline barrels are expected to fall by 900,000 barrels.\n\n\n\n\u2013 snapped back last week, and if it holds above 1.1000, it might pave the way for 1.1164 to be retested. If the wider bearish trend continues, it might target at 1.0900.\n\n\n\n\u2013 last Tuesday\u2019s daily candle has the potential to be a hammer, and if it holds above the 1.2200 area, it might bring 1.2400 into play. Support might be found at 1.1900, should the wider bearish move continue.\n\n\n\n\u2013 the weekly candle from mid-August appears to be a bearish reversal, and if the downward movement continues, it might target 0.8872. A rebound in the currency pair might bring 0.9200 into play.\n\n\n\n\u2013 rebounded last week, and a break above the 107.14 area \u2013 50-day moving average, it might bring 108.23 (100-day moving average) into play. Should the wider downtrend continue, it might retest the 104.50 area.\n\n\n\nis expected to open 24 points higher at 7,291\n\n\n\nis expected to open 62 points higher at 12,330\n\n\n\nis expected to open 9 points higher at 5,602\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
