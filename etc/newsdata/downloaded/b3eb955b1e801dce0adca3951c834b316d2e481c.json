They are doing over $2 million in renovations before moving in.\n\nCarey and Nancy Smith toured 41 New York City homes before finally agreeing this spring to pay almost $20 million for a Greenwich Village townhouse once owned by Malcolm Forbes. Their real-estate agent kept count.\n\nTheir search took them to houses and glitzy condos on the Upper East Side, Upper West Side, Tribeca, Midtown and beyond\u2014and into the homes of big name sellers like Jennifer Lopez and the late Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead. Frequently, they were underwhelmed by what was available.\n\n\u201cYou figure you can get whatever you want if it doesn\u2019t matter the amount of money. You expect nice finishes,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cNo frickin\u2019 way. Nasty stuff.\u201d\n\nCarey and Nancy Smith. Photo: Kelly Marshall for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Smiths, a quick-witted and plain-spoken couple who spent the last two decades in Kentucky, where they originally moved in 1991 for Mrs. Smith\u2019s career, are rethinking their lives following the $500 million sale of their ventilation company, Big Ass Fans, to the private-equity firm Lindsay Goldberg in 2017. It was the kind of cash infusion they\u2019d never expected. Suddenly, they were setting up a family investment office, dealing with reams of paperwork and managing a national real estate portfolio that comprised homes in Kentucky, Texas and New York.\n\n\u201cEvery time we went to the architect and the builder, we\u2019d say \u2018Thank God for fans!\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nThe Smiths, who launched the company in 1999, are well accustomed to answering the obvious question. The Big Ass moniker evolved over time, said Mr. Smith, 67. The ventilation company, which produces fans for residential, commercial and heavy duty industrial use, some priced at the time as high as $10,000, was originally known as the High Volume Low Speed Fan Company. But \u201cpeople would call and say \u2018Are you those guys who make those big ass fans?\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith remembered. After they renamed the company, critics called Mr. Smith to say he was going to hell and that he was contributing to a general coarsening of American culture, he said. \u201cPreachers and ding dongs,\u201d he dubbed them.\n\nA living area of the Smiths\u2019 new Greenwich Village townhouse in Manhattan.

She was at Northwestern and he was at the University of Chicago studying graduate economics. They have an adult son, who works for Mr. Smith\u2019s new venture capital and consulting firm, Unorthodox Ventures. Mr. Smith is originally from California but moved around a lot. She grew up mostly in Washington, D.C. and San Antonio, Tex. Newly flush with cash, they now envision splitting their time between their townhouse in New York and a new Spanish Colonial-style home they recently bought from the cyclist Lance Armstrong in Austin, Tex., for nearly $7 million. The Texas home will be their primary residence for tax purposes, and so Mr. Smith can be near his VC firm, which is based there.\n\nMaking that dream a reality has been harder than the Smiths thought. House-hunting, renovations and repairs have all been a headache, not to mention selling their longtime home in Kentucky.\n\nBut for Mrs. Smith, owning a property in New York City, where both her parents grew up, was a long-held dream.\n\nA rendering of the planned two-floor living and dining space in the Smiths\u2019 new Austin home.

Carey and Nancy Smith have exacting taste. Here are their thoughts on some of the homes they saw along the way: Jennifer Lopez\u2019s apartment Photo: Evan Joseph Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Apartment\n\nListed at $24.99 million\n\nThe Whitman Condominium\n\n4 bedroom, 6,540 square feet\n\nLOVED: The outdoor terrace\n\nDID NOT LOVE: \u201cThe bedrooms weren\u2019t nice.\u201d Mrs. Smith said. John Whitehead\u2019s Townhouse\n\nListed at $14.95 million (Sold to other buyers for $13 million)\n\nSutton Square\n\n5 bedrooms, 4,440 square feet\n\nLOVED: A dramatic curving staircase with a large picture window; Mr. Whitehead\u2019s extensive art collection; Mr. Whitehead\u2019s second wife, Cynthia Whitehead, who was the listing agent. \u201cShe was funny as hell,\u201d he said.\n\nDID NOT LOVE: The d\u00e9cor Lance Armstrong\u2019s House\n\nListed at $7.5 million (Sold for $7 million)\n\nWindsor Road, Austin Tex.\n\n6 bedrooms, 8,000 square feet\n\nLOVED: The pool area, below a live oak tree\n\nDID NOT LOVE: The chopped-up spaces, staircases between rooms Malcolm Forbes\u2019s Townhouse\n\nListed at $28.5 million (Sold for $20 million)\n\nWest 12th Street, New York\n\n5 bedrooms, 9,000 square feet\n\nLOVED: Proximity to Mr. Smith\u2019s favorite bagel joint, \u201cBagel Bobs.\u201d\n\nDID NOT LOVE: The furniture\n\nOne $67 million townhouse has wood cabinets they could have bought at Lowe\u2019s, they said. One particularly memorable townhouse has an enormous swimming pool in the living room with a swing. \u201cWe felt like we had to take a shower after leaving that place,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nEventually, they settled on the former Forbes townhouse because it ticked most of their boxes; it had a Greenwich Village location and outdoor space. The 1847 Greek Revival house, which spans about 9,000 square feet, had been owned for decades by the family of Malcolm Forbes, the late chairman and editor in chief of Forbes magazine. The family sold it in 2012, and it came on the market in April 2018 listed at $28.5 million.\n\nIn Austin, the Smiths found the ultrahot market almost impossible to navigate. Properties would hit the market one day and be sold the next. The home they bought required a lot of work, they said. They initially thought they\u2019d rent a condo during renovations but they eventually shelled out $2.71 million for a temporary home in the Pemberton Heights neighborhood.\n\nThey\u2019ve also had trouble trying to sell their longtime home in Lexington, Ky., which has an asking price of close to $2 million. Before they sold the company, the Smiths thought it would be their \u201cforever home.\u201d They\u2019d customized it to their personal tastes, which aren\u2019t the typical Lexington look. The three-bedroom, Japanese-style home has open-plan living spaces, stone walls, and maple and bamboo floors.\n\n\u201cLexington is very traditional,\u201d Mrs. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s all Chippendale furniture and white columns and intricate moldings. That\u2019s not what this is.\u201d\n\nOf course, almost every room in the house has its own fan, with the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance being a gold-plated fan in the master suite. Mr. Smith said he commissioned it, in part, because he thought \u201cit might be interesting to Middle Easterners or Saudis or something.\u201d\n\nThe living room of the Smiths\u2019 Lexington, Ky., home. It is listed for almost $2 million. Photo: Matt Huber / Matt Mediaworks\n\nThe original home was built in 2003 and then expanded and renovated around 2016 at a cost of around $800,000. It\u2019s been on the market for almost a year and the price has been slashed from $2.999 million to $1.949 million.\n\nMrs. Smith has been living in Kentucky to sell the house, while Mr. Smith resides mostly in Austin these days to oversee the renovation of their new place. \u201cIt\u2019s hard and we don\u2019t get to see each other that much,\u201d Mrs. Smith said. \u201cWe saw each other in February and then in April and then not again until July.\u201d While that might be weird for some couples, it is relatively normal for the Smiths, who spent only seven of their first 15 years of marriage living in the same place.\n\n\u201c \u201cIt was like \u2018The 90s called and they want their house back.\u2019\u201d \u201d \u2014Nancy Smith\n\nWhen Mr. Smith first toured their new Austin home, he wasn\u2019t particularly impressed. The 1920s-era Mediterranean-style home, located in the historic Old Enfield neighborhood and once owned by Ben Barnes, the lieutenant governor of Texas, was carved up into tight spaces and had small sets of stairs separating the living areas, he said. An extension that had been added by a previous owner cut out some natural light and made the interiors look gloomy, he said.\n\nThe couple have tapped a local architect, Charles Di Piazza, to spearhead a $2 million to $3 million redo, opening up the ground floor into one sprawling two-story living room and combining the bedrooms for better proportions. They estimate that the process could take about two years.\n\nThe Smiths purchased this Pemberton Heights home for $2.71 million to have somewhere to live while they renovate their Austin home.

A representative for Mr. Armstrong said he did about $1.5 million in renovations to the home.\n\nIn New York, the couple plans to replace a lot of the d\u00e9cor. They just bought the furniture from the previous owners, Mrs. Smith said, so they would have \u201ca place to sit.\u201d\n\nWhile the New York house has central air, Mr. Smith said he still plans to bring in fans.\n\n\u201cYou always need fans,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Katherine Clarke at katherine.clarke@wsj.com", "description": "The founders of Big Ass Fans have purchased property belonging to prominent names like Malcolm Forbes and Lance Armstrong.
