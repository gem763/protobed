In Holland, most gardeners treat tulips as annuals and take them out and bin them at the end of spring, or at least lift and store them. They prefer not to leave tulips in the ground to avoid the risk of tulip blight spores building up in the soil. In Britain, most of us feel that binning is wasteful and lifting is too much work, so we leave them. We certainly do that at Perch Hill and have noted which are the best at reappearing and remaining healthy from one year to the next.", "description": "I am a tulipomaniac and I am about to start planting just short of 20,000 bulbs here at Perch Hill in Sussex (with assistance, I might add).", "authors": ["Sarah Raven"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gardening/2017/09/07/TELEMMGLPICT000139370931-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM1jqde5a-OJSmCYBLBIfDY3nLQ8nk541cCTuloBV3RY.jpeg", "published_at": "2017-09-07"}
