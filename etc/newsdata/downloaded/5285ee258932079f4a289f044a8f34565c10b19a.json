Peloton raised $1.16 billion through its public offering at a valuation of around $8 billion, and sold an additional $100 million in shares at the IPO price to an investor that had previously provided venture funding.\n\nPeloton sells spinning bikes and treadmills that connect to the internet and have touch screens, along with subscription offerings that let users participate in virtual fitness classes. A Peloton bike starts at $2,245, while a Peloton treadmill begins at $4,295.\n\nPeloton IPO: 5 things to know about the interactive exercise-machine company\n\nThough Wall Street gave a generally warm reception to newly public companies with recurring revenue streams earlier in the year, sentiment has been weaker in recent months. Peloton Chief Financial Officer Jill Woodworth said that the company noticed headlines expressing \u201cconcern about high-growth tech companies and profitability\u201d as Peloton embarked on its IPO roadshow, though she found that investors she spoke with \u201cunderstand we\u2019re both growth-focused and very disciplined.\u201d\n\nThe company pays for a lot of its subscription-focused marketing expenses through the sale of its bikes, Woodworth said in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nPeloton saw revenue more than double in fiscal 2019, to $719.2 million from $348.6 million, but the company\u2019s losses swelled as well. Peloton reported a net loss of $195.6 million for the period, compared with $47.9 million a year prior.\n\n\u201cWe obviously wish the stock traded better on the first day, but we\u2019re in it for the long haul and are excited for capital to continue to grow our business,\u201d Woodworth said. She pointed to plans for new products and software as well as further international growth, as the company looks to expand into Germany shortly.\n\nFor more: IPO investors are pushing back on \u2018growth-at-all-costs\u2019 private companies\n\nWoodworth also discussed Peloton\u2019s music-licensing efforts, which saw the company establish direct relationships with labels and publishers so that instructors could incorporate popular music into their classes. Music licensing costs totaled $50.6 million in the past three years, according to the company\u2019s IPO prospectus.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect to have any leverage in those talks over time, but we\u2019re still able to achieve very healthy growth margins in the subscription business,\u201d she said.\n\nPeloton\u2019s IPO comes as the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO, -0.79% has dropped 6.6% over the past three months and as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.24% has ticked up 2.4% in that time.", "description": "Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc. backpedaled on Thursday after the connected-fitness company held its initial public offering amid skepticism about...", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS154_peloto_ZG_20190926145554.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
