Photo: Tibrina Hobson/WireImage\n\nRecently, Vulture threatened to take the film Lucy in the Sky to the Supreme Court over the decision not to have lead actress Natalie Portman wear a diaper in the movie. Lucy is inspired by the true story of Lisa Nowak, an astronaut who allegedly wore a diaper to minimize pit stops during a long road trip she took to confront a former lover. When the movie premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and it was revealed that no diapers made it into the story on screen, a backlash (of sorts) was born. Portman is aware of this, and she has explained to the Los Angeles Times why this one detail everyone is so fixated on got left out of her movie. Addressing \u201cthe diaper sadness,\u201d the actress said it was \u201cthe most salient, tabloid-y detail\u201d of Nowak\u2019s story, and therefore including it would have too closely linked the real person to the fictional one. Portman wasn\u2019t playing Lucy Nowak. She was playing Lucy Cola, so they didn\u2019t want to more fully imply she was portraying this actual human being.\n\n\u201cIt was an interesting detail, because it was something that seemed so radical to all of us listening to it,\u201d Portman told the LAT. \u201cBut actually it\u2019s part of an astronaut\u2019s life. They wear diapers the whole time because that\u2019s what you do in space. It\u2019s not like it would be an unusual choice. It seems a lot nuttier if that\u2019s not something you do every day. But I guess I still have a diaper movie in my future to fulfill everyone\u2019s expectations.\u201d Well there you go, Natalie. You\u2019ve put \u201ca diaper movie\u201d on the record for fans, so be prepared to follow through. Unless you want to see us in front of the Supreme Court.", "description": "Natalie Portman addresses the lack of diapers in Lucy in the Sky and says she could still have \u201ca diaper movie\u201d in her future since flams are clamoring.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-natalie-portman.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
