UPDATE 1-U.S. natgas futures slide on forecasts for big storage injections\n\nOct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures slipped on Tuesday on expectations of big storage injections to come, despite forecasts that heating demand and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports will rise more than previously expected over the next two weeks.\n\n\"We are expecting another larger than normal injection that could place further pressures on the front of the curve in triggering a renewed influx of speculative capital into the short side,\" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a report.\n\nFront-month gas futures for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 1.5 cents, or 0.7%, to settle at $2.288 per million British thermal units.\n\nThat decline carried over to longer-dated futures, with all contracts through 2022 down about 2 cents.\n\nRefinitiv projected gas demand in the lower 48 U.S. states would reach 82.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week and 85.2 bcfd next week, up from its previous forecasts on Monday of 82.3 bcfd for this week and 84.5 bcfd for next week.\n\nMost of that increase in demand is due to cooler forecasts that will boost heating demand faster than power generator cooling demand declines.\n\nGas flows to LNG export plants edged up to 6.1 bcfd on Monday from 6.0 bcfd on Sunday, according to Refinitiv data. That compares with an average of 6.1 bcfd last week and an all-time daily high of 6.8 bcfd on Aug. 25.\n\nRefinitiv projected LNG exports could return to record highs next week after Dominion Energy Inc's D.N Cove Point plant in Maryland returns to service. said utilities likely added 88 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas to storage during the week ended Oct. 4. Some analysts, like Ritterbusch, projected a bigger injection of around 100 bcf.\n\nThat compares with an injection of 91 bcf during the same week last year and a five-year (2014-18) average build of 89 bcf for the period.\n\nIf correct, that increase would boost stockpiles to 3.405 trillion cubic feet (tcf), 0.6% below the five-year average of 3.424 tcf for this time of year.\n\nThe amount of gas in inventory has remained below the five-year average since September 2017. It fell as much as 33% below that in March 2019. But with production close to a record high, analysts said stockpiles should reach a near-normal 3.7 tcf by the end of summer injection season on Oct. 31. NGAS/POLL\n\nGas production in the lower 48 states edged up to 92.9 bcfd on Monday from 92.5 bcfd on Sunday, according to Refinitiv data. That compares with an average of 93.1 bcfd last week and an all-time daily high of 93.8 bcfd on Sept. 29.\n\nWeek ended Week ended Year ago Five-year\n\nOct 4\n\naverage\n\n4(Forecast 27(Actual)\n\nOct 4\n\nU.S. natgas storage (bcf):\n\nRefinitiv Heating (HDD), Cooling (CDD) and Total (TDD) Degree Days\n\nTwo-Week Total Forecast\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior Day\n\nPrior\n\n10-Year\n\n30-Year\n\nNorm U.S. GFS HDDs\n\n124 U.S. GFS CDDs\n\n42 U.S. GFS TDDs\n\nRefinitiv U.S. Weekly GFS Supply and Demand Forecasts\n\nPrior Week\n\nCurrent\n\nNext Week This week Five-Yea\n\nlast year\n\nAverage\n\nMonth U.S. Supply (bcfd)\n\nU.S. Lower 48 Dry Production\n\n75.5 U.S. Imports from Canada\n\n7.6 U.S. LNG Imports\n\n0.2 Total U.S. Supply\n\n100.2\n\nU.S. Demand (bcfd) U.S. Exports to Canada\n\n2.4 U.S. Exports to Mexico\n\n3.7 U.S. LNG Exports\n\n1.2 U.S. Commercial\n\n6.6 U.S. Residential\n\n6.8 U.S. Power Plant\n\n25.2 U.S. Industrial\n\n20.5 U.S. Plant Fuel\n\n4.6 U.S. Pipe Distribution\n\n1.9 U.S. Vehicle Fuel\n\n0.1 Total U.S. Consumption\n\n65.7 Total U.S. Demand\n\nSNL U.S. Natural Gas Next-Day Prices ($ per mmBtu)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior Day\n\nHenry Hub NG-W-HH-SNL\n\nTransco Z6 New York NG-CG-NY-SNL\n\nPG&E Citygate NG-CG-PGE-SNL\n\nDominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL\n\nChicago Citygate NG-CG-CH-SNL\n\nAlgonquin Citygate NG-CG-BS-SNL\n\nSoCal Citygate NG-SCL-CGT-SNL\n\nWaha Hub NG-WAH-WTX-SNL\n\nSNL U.S. Power Next-Day Prices ($ per megawatt-hour)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior Day\n\nNew England EL-PK-NPMS-SNL\n\n23.75\n\n16.50\n\nPJM West EL-PK-PJMW-SNL\n\n25.25\n\n21.50\n\nErcot North EL-PK-ERTN-SNL\n\n21.25\n\n80.00\n\nMid C EL-PK-MIDC-SNL\n\n26.94\n\n37.75\n\nPalo Verde EL-PK-PLVD-SNL\n\n42.25\n\n40.25\n\nSP-15 EL-PK-SP15-SNL\n\n42.50\n\n41.25", "description": "U.S. natgas futures slide on forecasts for big storage injections", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0E0N3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
