They would even remove the gallbladder outside the body, which contains toxic bile salts. They knew to remove that bit.\u201d\n\nShe added that the rats understood which areas of the toad were poisonous, using their sharp teeth and dextrous hands to eat the non-toxic parts while leaving the poisonous areas stripped.\n\n\u201cIn the medium-sized toads, as well as eating the heart and liver, they would strip off the toxic skin from one or both legs and eat the non-toxic thigh muscle,\" Parrott said, according to the Guardian. \u201cThey have very strong sharp teeth, very dextrous little hands. They can pick up a fish or a yabby and open them up very quickly and target the areas they like.\u201d\n\nResearchers observed 38 toad carcasses floating in the river or creekbed over 15 days, with all of the carcasses having a cut in their chest areas that measured 10.8mm (1.08cm) vertically and 12.2mm (1.2cm) horizontally.\n\nIVAN MILAT, AUSTRALIA'S MOST NOTORIOUS SERIAL KILLER, DIES IN PRISON AT 74\n\nThe study suggested the rats purposely targeted the bigger cane toads - who only make up 2.5 percent of the toad population in the area while making up 74 percent of the carcasses found, according to the Guardian. The rats were also found to hold the amphibians on their back, harvesting on their bodies while they were still alive.\n\n\u201cWater rats are quite large themselves,\u201d Parrott said, according to the outlet. \u201cThey have the power to subdue a larger toad and get a bigger payload, get that larger heart and larger liver. By killing those larger toads, it may be easier to avoid the toxic organs like the gallbladder.\u201d\n\nResearchers believe the rats either learned the technique by trial and error or had previous experience from eating Australian native toxic frogs. They added that parental training could have assisted in developing younger rats to learn the technique.\n\n\u201cThe parents have quite a long period of care with their offspring. The baby rats will stay with their mother and they can learn from their parents. It would make very good sense that their parents are teaching their children how to kill those cane toads and avoid those poisonous areas,\" Parrott said, according to the outlet.\n\nShe hopes to shed light on the predatorial and environmental threats faced by these rats - while showing the importance and intelligence of the native rodents.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201c[The findings] show the intelligence of our native rodents,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t really know we have native rodents in Australia. A story like this has really raised their profile and made people not only realize they are very clever but they are a very beautiful animal we should be protecting.\u201d", "description": "Highly intelligent Australian water rats have learned how to kill poisonous cane toads by eating their hearts and carving their organs with \"surgical precision,\" according to research published in Australian Mammalogy.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/cane-toad-water-rat-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
