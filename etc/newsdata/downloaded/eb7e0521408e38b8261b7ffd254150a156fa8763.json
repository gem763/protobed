Especially for those with accessibility issues.\n\n'But this idea will not work and is completely ludicrous.'\n\nThe use of jazz hands - where students wave their hands in the air - is the British Sign Language expression for applause and is deemed a more inclusive gesture.\n\nThe motion, which carried, mandates the encouragement of sign language clapping by Sabbatical Officers at union meetings and events (file photo of students at the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford)\n\nIt comes after the University of Manchester Students Union passed a motion to do the same thing in September last year.\n\nMs McCallion said: 'The policy was proposed in order to encourage the use of British Sign Language clapping during our democratic events to make those events more accessible and inclusive for all, including people who suffer from anxiety.\n\n'Inclusivity is one of the Students' Union's founding principles.'", "description": "The idea for a British sign language alternative for clapping involving the waving of hands or 'jazz hands' was put forward at the student union's first union meeting of the year on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/18/20095584-0-image-a-9_1571852854097.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
