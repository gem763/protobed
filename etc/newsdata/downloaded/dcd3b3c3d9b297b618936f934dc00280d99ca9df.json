(Picture: SWNS)\n\nMr Hill confirmed the painting had been taken down and admitted it should have been removed before the restaurant opened to the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018It\u2019s depiction and potential interpretation had already been identified during our review of the restaurant before being open to customers and should have been removed.\n\n\u2018It was an oversight on our behalf that this hadn\u2019t happened before we welcomed our first guests.\n\n\u2018Each of our restaurants is individually designed and our creative design team select artists and their collections to complement the bespoke design.\n\n\u2018On this occasion something has gone wrong with our selection process for specific artworks which has enabled this piece and its potential interpretation to appear.\n\n\u2018I will be reviewing our process to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u2019\n\nThe boss of Nando\u2019s UK apologised twice to the diner who complained about the picture (Picture: Empics Sport)\n\nThe customer accused Mr Hill of failing to take the situation seriously.\n\nHe commented: \u2018As a black man, I think this is completely unacceptable, weird, and deeply offensive.\n\n\u2018Many of my friends are white, and they\u2019ve said they are shocked by its depiction of what I can only assume is advocated racism.\n\n\u2018Someone will have gone out to buy artwork for the branch, and someone decided that this was an appropriate painting.\n\n\u2018Who on earth could have allowed this to happen?\n\nThe diner was not happy with the response he received from Nando\u2019s CEO Colin Hill (Picture: EMPICS Sport)\n\nAfter the customer wrote back, Mr Hill apologised again \u2013 and received a return message from the customer.\n\nHe wrote: \u2018You fail to realise there would have been children in the restaurant and a specific demographic that would have been highly offended by that picture \u2013 I don\u2019t understand how such an oversight could have occurred in a company of your stature \u2013 and indeed a company that houses an extremely diverse customer base that transcends race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I guess, in some part, the matter is closed.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
