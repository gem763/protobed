There was no immediate statement from Kensington Palace.\n\n\u2013 Sporting visitors \u2013\n\nThe mid-air flight drama came after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had spent the day exploring Lahore, Pakistan\u2019s cultural capital.\n\nThe royal couple kicked off their fourth day in Pakistan with a visit to the SOS Children\u2019s Village orphanage, where Kate gave a brief speech along with a short greeting in Urdu and celebrated children\u2019s birthdays.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year I talked about the fact that it takes a village to raise a child. The village we\u2019ve seen here today is the best representation of that ideal that I could have possibly imagined,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess later took to the crease at the National Cricket Academy, where they both hit a few runs as they played alongside a host of current and former cricket stars, including current bowling coach Waqar Younis.\n\nAfter an outfit change, the duo headed to Lahore\u2019s famous Badshahi Mosque \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest.\n\nWilliam sported a cream-coloured linen suit and Kate donned a light green shalwar kameez, wrapping her hair in a matching headscarf and walking in stockinged feet to show her respect.\n\nWilliam\u2019s mother, the late Princess Diana, caused a controversy at the same mosque in 1991 when she wore an above-the-knee dress, sparking a backlash from some Muslim leaders who argued she should have covered up.\n\nThe couple rounded off the trip with a visit to the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, founded by Prime Minister Imran Khan, where Diana is remembered fondly for helping raise money for the facility in the 1990s.\n\nKensington Palace has called the Cambridges\u2019 five-day trip, which ends Friday, their \u201cmost complex\u201d tour to date as the royals seek to boost ties between Britain and the second largest country in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe couple have spent much of the trip promoting various causes, from girls\u2019 education to conservation and climate change awareness as they criss-crossed the country.\n\nSecurity has improved dramatically since the army intensified a crackdown on militant groups in 2015, with several countries changing their travel warnings for Pakistan as a result, and Islamabad eager to promote both tourism and foreign investment.\n\nThere are promising signs, such as the British Airways return earlier this year after more than a decade, and the slow but steady revival of international cricket.", "description": "Lahore (Pakistan) (AFP) \u2013 A fierce storm in Islamabad forced a plane carrying Britain\u2019s Prince William and his wife Kate to abandon two", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/98d509_prince-william-his-wife-kate-explored-lahore-famous-badshahi-mosque-one-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
