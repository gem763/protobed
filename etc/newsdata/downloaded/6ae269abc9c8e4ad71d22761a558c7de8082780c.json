By the end of the day, he knew there was just a one in 200,000 chance Manager B was legitimate.\n\nDiBartolomeo promptly forgot about the job, but Markopolos used Northfield\u2019s numbers to appeal to the Securities and Exchange Commission to take action on Madoff.\n\nHarry Markopolos came to Dan diBartolomeo to help expose Madoff. Bloomberg\n\nDiBartolomeo says he finally learned who Manager B was at Christmas 2004, but it wasn\u2019t until Madoff\u2019s arrest in December 2008 that he connected the dots and became a minor celebrity for a few days.\n\nHe says he believes many of Madoff\u2019s clients knew the manager was crooked but that they believed he was stealing for them, not from them.\n\nWhile 95 per cent of Northfield\u2019s revenue comes from selling risk management software and tools, the Madoff case was an example of what diBartolomeo describes as the weird problems clients bring him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike when the US pension giant California Public Employees' Retirement System asked Northfield to assess the risks and opportunities in hiring and firing its asset manager according to a formula, rather than by a specialist department. (It is possible, and delivers pretty similar results.)\n\nOr when the US State Department asked diBartolomeo to examine whether sovereign wealth funds could protect their fixed income portfolios by using tools like charitable grants to forestall armed conflict. (If the sovereigns are big enough, this does indeed make sense).\n\nOr when wealthy families want to understand how to diversify portfolios that include everything from global companies to rare art collections or jewellery. (You could actually get liquid proxy for an illiquid jewellery collection with a basket of gold, diamonds and Tiffany\u2019s stock).\n\nMore going out than coming in\n\nOr, as diBartolomeo discussed in Washington before travelling to Australia, when pension funds start to think about what happens when they have more money going out the door than coming in.\n\nA potential problem in this shift, diBartolomeo says, comes from the increasing levels of illiquid assets in the portfolios of super funds. Pension funds have favoured things like infrastructure, private equity and property in recent years as they chase yield amid falling interest rates.\n\nSelling liquid asset to pay benefits is relatively easy. But diBartolomeo argues pension funds need to consider the risk of being caught with a portfolio dominated with illiquid assets that are harder to liquidate.\n\nThis risk also needs to be considered in the context of an event like an equity market crash, where a pension fund might need to sell illiquid assets in a hurry, resulting in a value-destroying fire sale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiBartolomeo says an even greater danger stems from the fact that some pension funds have favoured illiquid assets because they aren\u2019t subject to the daily price movements of equities or bonds. An office building, for example, would most likely be valued annually.\n\n\u201cThe problem with that is that that tends to smooth out the ups and downs of the actual values by a great deal. You can greatly understate the risk in an illiquid asset,\u201d diBartolomeo says.\n\nBut the value of illiquid assets does shift every day, even if that\u2019s hard to track. While a commercial real estate firm might estimate price volatility in commercial property at, for example, 4 per cent across a year, diBartolomeo says this looks silly given listed property trusts, which collect a group of these assets, have annual volatility three times that.\n\nNorthfield\u2019s aim is to use mathematical models to try to quantify risks like this and develop potential solutions.\n\nIn the case of illiquid assets, this could be a model to help a pension fund gradually sell down over a long period. Or it might involve developing the maths to show how a liquid substitute for illiquid assets \u2013 a basket of property trusts, construction companies and other stocks, for example \u2013 could work.\n\nAs diBartolomeo says, Northfield won\u2019t tell a client what to believe. But the firm will give a client of a good sense of what the mathematics says they should do.\n\n\u201cA lot of what we do on a day-to-day basis is really enforcing clarity of thinking.\u201d", "description": "Maths wizard Dan diBartolomeo says Australia\u2019s super funds may be underestimating the risks associated with illiquid assets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7915%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_139/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6a9aaf9e7d88708e14a6044c8f371f5a312d66ee", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
