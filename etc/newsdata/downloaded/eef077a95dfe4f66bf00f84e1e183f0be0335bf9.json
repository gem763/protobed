Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), accusing them of \u201ctrying to con\u201d Americans akin to President Trump with their proposals on foreign policy and health care.\n\n\u201cI have never heard anyone say, with any serious background in foreign policy, that we pull all troops out of the Middle East,\u201d Biden said Wednesday outside a union hall in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cIf she meant pulling our fleet out of the eastern Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf, I think it would be an absolute disaster for American security and American foreign policy.\u201d\n\nWarren didn\u2019t offer that level of detail Tuesday when she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East.\u201d But her statement garnered immediate attention on social media and forced her campaign aides to clarify that she meant only combat troops.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator has previously advocated for shrinking the U.S. footprint overseas and has said she wants to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. Withdrawing troops from the entire region would go further and end generations of U.S. presence in the volatile region.\n\nSeparately Wednesday, Biden swatted at Warren for avoiding questions on whether her proposed single-payer government health insurance plan would require middle-class tax increases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that a person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,\u201d Biden said, adding that \u201ccredibility matters.\u201d\n\nWarren took several minutes of heat Tuesday night over the issue, sticking to her argument that a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system would drive down costs for middle-class households by eliminating their current expenses for private insurance premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. Her suggestion is that those savings would outweigh any tax increases, an analysis Biden said would not apply for every middle-class wage earner.\n\nThe senator \u201cis going to have to tell the truth,\u201d Biden said, or face questions about her willingness \u201cto be candid and honest with the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not picking on Elizabeth Warren, but this is ridiculous,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden backs a public option, a government insurance plan that would be optional for Americans who already have private health insurance. His campaign maintains that most Democratic primary voters \u2014 and certainly most general election voters \u2014 oppose any overhaul that effectively eliminates private health insurance.\n\nThe former vice president then turned his attention to Sanders, who returned to the national stage for the first time Wednesday evening since suffering a heath attack two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cAnd God love Bernie, and it was really good, I really mean it, to see him so healthy and moving last night, I really mean that,\u201d said Biden. \u201cHe\u2019s been through hell, by the way. You know his daughter in law died of cancer like my son, I mean this guy has been through hell, I was glad to see him, I really mean it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Bernie, Bernie doesn\u2019t pay for half his plan,\u201d he explained. \u201cLook the last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing Trump\u2019s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy. There\u2019s nothing easy about it. If you\u2019re going to do it, tell us how you\u2019re going to do it. It\u2019s called truth in speaking.\u201d", "description": "Biden accused Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders of \"trying to con\" Americans like Trump with proposals on foreign policy and health care.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181340161-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
