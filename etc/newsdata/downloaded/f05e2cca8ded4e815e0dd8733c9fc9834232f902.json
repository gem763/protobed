Jacob Connor)\n\nIt\u2019s not troop presence, which serves aims that are in America\u2019s interest.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria should not have surprised anyone. He has consistently opposed U.S. military involvement in Syria, other than for the purposes of defeating the Islamic State terrorists and imposing penalties on the Assad regime for its use of chemical weapons. Similarly, there should be no great surprise if one day Trump orders U.S. troops to leave Afghanistan. He has been clear about his opposition to the U.S. presence there, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn defending his position, Trump sometimes describes his goal as ending \u201cendless wars.\u201d However, his policies have not always followed that trope. There are more U.S. forces overseas today than when his administration began. In the same week when he announced withdrawal of a thousand troops from Syria, he ordered an additional 2,000 to be deployed to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut others, most prominently Senator Rand Paul and congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, use the term more expansively, summing up their foreign-policy vision as ending \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\nIf an \u201cendless war\u201d is something to be avoided, we should first define what the term means. Then we should examine whether it is even possible to end such engagement, and, if it is, at what cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes a long-term presence of American military forces constitute an \u201cendless war\u201d? If so, then World War II can be said never to have ended. U.S. forces have been on the territory of our former enemies in Germany, Italy, and Japan continuously since 1945 and currently number more than 100,000. That\u2019s vastly more than we have in the Middle East.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy that definition, the Korean War did not end in 1953. Rather, it too is an \u201cendless war,\u201d as we have more than 25,000 American forces in South Korea today.\n\nWhile the Rand Paul\u2013Tulsi Gabbard alliance might favor withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Europe and Asia, most Americans don\u2019t think of World War II or the Korean War as being \u201cendless,\u201d despite our substantial troop presence in those theaters. Probably that\u2019s because our troops haven\u2019t been involved in combat there in decades.\n\nMere troop presence, therefore, seems not to be the essence of an \u201cendless war.\u201d What about the existence of danger to our troops?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have about a thousand military personnel on our base in Cuba. Tensions between the United States and Cuba have been so high that we did not even have formal relations for half a century, from 1961 to 2015. Does this tension and risk mean we\u2019ve had an \u201cendless war\u201d with Cuba?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, together with some 4,000 American military personnel, is headquartered in Bahrain. That tiny country lies less than 500 miles from Iran \u2014 within easy striking distance of Iranian short-range missiles. Have we been in an \u201cendless war\u201d with Iran since the 1979 Iranian revolution that began with the U.S. hostage crisis? Our troops are certainly exposed to significant risk in the Persian Gulf.\n\nMost Americans would not say we are in \u201cendless wars\u201d with Cuba or Iran.\n\nWe keep troops in Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Cuba, and the Persian Gulf region for a reason. It is not to prolong \u201cendless wars\u201d that are in no sense actual wars. It is to protect American interests in preventing future wars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat about Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan?\n\nWe have roughly a thousand troops in Syria, about the same as in Cuba. It\u2019s true that there is active combat in Syria, but it hasn\u2019t much involved Americans. In the entire eight-year Syrian civil war, there have been a total of eight American service deaths. While even one death is tragic, more U.S. troops are killed in training accidents every year than in our entire time in Syria. This low level of U.S. participation doesn\u2019t seem to fit the \u201cendless war\u201d thesis any more than our presence in Cuba does.\n\nBeginning in 2003, we had a major war in Iraq. There have been over 4,500 U.S. military deaths in Iraq. Of those, 81, or fewer than 2 percent, occurred in the last seven years. The U.S. troop level in Iraq peaked at 166,000. Today, it\u2019s around 5,000. So, if our presence in Iraq constitutes an \u201cendless war,\u201d then we are 97 percent of the way toward ending it.\n\nAfghanistan might be a clearer example of an \u201cendless war.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfghanistan has sometimes been called \u201cAmerica\u2019s longest war.\u201d It began a month after the American homeland was attacked on September 11, 2001. Since then, over 2,400 U.S. service personnel have been killed in action, including 14 this year. Our troop level peaked at 100,000 in 2010. Today our force in Afghanistan stands at about 14,000, alongside another 17,000 from numerous coalition-partner countries.\n\nComparing Afghanistan to Vietnam is instructive. Depending on how one marks the beginning of the Vietnam War, it could be considered a longer war than Afghanistan. America paid a huge price in Vietnam, with nearly 60,000 killed in action.\n\nWe have zero troops in Vietnam today. But the war did not exactly \u201cend\u201d when American troops left. In the immediate wake of the U.S. withdrawal, our South Vietnamese allies suffered tremendously. Millions of Vietnamese civilians were placed in prison camps or forced to flee at the hands of the victorious Communists. Hundreds of thousands were murdered, starved to death, or drowned at sea. Millions more were murdered soon after in the genocide in neighboring Cambodia. These were consequences of ending the \u201cendless war\u201d in Vietnam.\n\nIn Afghanistan, President Obama began our drawdown with a stated goal of removing all U.S. troops by the end of 2016. He reversed that decision and maintained 8,600 troops in place when he left office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump also sought to remove U.S. troops from Afghanistan, but seven months into office, he too reversed course, stating in August 2017 that \u201cconditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables, will guide our strategy from now on.\u201d Trump increased our troop level by more than 5,000.\n\nNeither Obama nor Trump could fairly be described as overeager to continue \u201cendless wars.\u201d Yet both came to the same conclusion about continuing some U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. As with the aftermath of our departure from Vietnam, concern about the consequences of full U.S. withdrawal weighed on the minds of two presidents who otherwise could scarcely be more different.\n\nIt turns out that defining \u201cendless war\u201d is not so easy, and ending one is not entirely attractive.\n\nIn the era of radical Islamic terrorism, keeping a U.S. military presence near our enemies serves a function similar to that of keeping a presence in Germany and South Korea. In Europe and Asia, our presence has helped prevent future war on a larger scale, as well as humanitarian catastrophes. Even the prospect of removal of U.S. forces from Syria is already having visible consequences. Withdrawal from Afghanistan might not end an \u201cendless war.\u201d It could lead to a bigger war down the road that is more dangerous for Americans.\n\nIn 1928, the United States and other leading countries signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which officially outlawed war. It was that generation\u2019s attempt to end \u201cendless wars.\u201d Eleven years later, the same countries were immersed in the largest war the world has ever known.\n\nIn fact, no period in human history has been without wars. No one has ever figured out a way to permanently end them. The best we can do is prepare for them robustly, prevent them as aggressively as possible, and win them when we must.", "description": "Whatever \u201cendless war\u201d is, it\u2019s not troop presence, which serves aims that are in America\u2019s interest.", "authors": ["Jon Lerner", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
