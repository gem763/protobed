A lot is likely to hinge on this month\u2019s China, US trade talks if they do take place.\n\nIn China the latest and \u2019s for August were somewhat mixed with a modest improvement in services, while the manufacturing surveys showed stagnation either side of 50.\n\nAsia\u2019s rather disappointing session stands in contrast to a positive start for Europe\u2019s markets this morning though this could well change as we look towards Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector where recent flash data has shown some evidence of a modest improvement, albeit from fairly low levels.\n\nThe slipped below the 1.1000 level last week for the first time in over two years as speculation grows that the ECB will embark on another stimulus plan when it meets in ten days\u2019 time, against a backdrop of a weakening economic outlook, particularly in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe latest manufacturing numbers from , , and has reinforced this weakness although they have improved from the July numbers, with modest improvements to 48.8, 48.7, 51.1 and 43.5 respectively.\n\nThe is coming under early pressure over weekend headlines that appear to suggest that a possible election could come sooner rather than later. has the potential to be a significant sentiment shifter if MPs succeed in passing legislation that might block a no deal Brexit, with the tug of war inside the Conservative party set to play a key part in determining how the pound fares in what is likely to be a turbulent week.\n\nWe also have the added wrinkle of a number of prorogation court cases that are set to be ruled upon in the coming days. An interim injunction has already been rejected with a full hearing tomorrow in Edinburgh to consider the merits of the case. The judge requested a formal affidavit from the PM on oath as to why he needs to suspend parliament. Another case will be heard on Thursday in a case brought by Gina Miller and joined by John Major, with the chances of success seemingly slim.\n\nHow the pound reacts to the week\u2019s events is increasingly becoming difficult to gauge, even if the various rebels win a vote to extend article 50, beyond the 31st October. First of all the EU has to grant such a request, and secondly it\u2019s not immediately obvious what the point of another 8 months would be able to do in unlocking the current log jam, a logjam that has paralysed UK politics for the last three years, and merely prolongs the uncertainty of stagnation into next year.\n\nThe has continued to push higher, something that is likely to displease President Trump, but something that he will find very difficult to stop even if the Federal Reserve were to do what he has asked it to do and cut rates by 100bp. The reality is the US dollar remains the best of a very sorry bunch in terms of yield and the strength of the US economy.\n\nIn company news AstraZeneca (LON: ) is higher after announcing results from its latest trials of its cardiovascular drug Brilinta. These showed that it reduced the risk of death and heart attack, by 10% compared with aspirin.\n\nMarks and Spencer (LON: ) is also underperforming as it gets set to be relegated out of the in what would be the first time it has never been in the main blue chip index. Having narrowly escaped relegation in the last reshuffle its performance since then appears to have ensured it falls through the trap door since then. In a way a spell out of the spotlight may well do it some good and based on the performance of previous companies that have fallen out of the UK benchmark it hasn\u2019t been too long before they have returned.\n\nUS markets are closed\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution only provider.
