In March, Zuckerberg included end-to-end encryption in a list of additions he wanted to add to the company\u2019s other platforms like Messenger. Even Facebook would be prevented from seeing what users share with each other.\n\n\u201cAs I think about the future of the internet, I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today\u2019s open platforms,\u201d he wrote in a post at the time. \u201cPrivacy gives people the freedom to be themselves and connect more naturally, which is why we build social networks.\u201d\n\nThe government and big tech companies have been on opposite sides of the back door issue since the FBI asked Apple to provide it with a way to break into an iPhone belonging to a mass shooter in 2016. The company refused, and the issue ended up falling to the wayside after investigators found another way into the phone.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Officials are planning to ask the company to hold off from encrypting messages.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/03/0/0/AP19089769228326.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
