However, such radical changes in direction are not unusual for typhoons nearing Japan, which sees around 20 per year.\n\nHagibis could also continue its easterly track and miss Japan altogether.\n\n\"The Honshu main islands will see heavy rains from as early as Friday, and the peak of the bad weather will be on Saturday and Sunday,\" JMA official Yoshinori Muira told AFP.\n\nHagibis is currently classed as \"violent\" -- the JMA's highest classification, with gusts as strong as 270 kilometers per hour. It is forecast to weaken before it nears Japan but will still be \"very strong\".\n\nIf the current forecast holds, the danger would appear to be lower for crunch games in the southwest (Ireland-Samoa on Saturday in Fukuoka and Wales-Uruguay on Sunday in Kumamoto).\n\nHowever, with the storm shifting east, there is now a threat for two other huge games in Yokohama.\n\nEngland play France in a Pool C decider in Yokohama on Saturday and Japan play Scotland on Sunday, in a match that will determine whether the hosts qualify for their first quarter-final.\n\nOrganizers had warned Monday that the typhoon \"could bring high winds and heavy rain to southern Japan on Oct 12 and 13.\"\n\n\"While it is too early to determine the exact trajectory and impact, if any, of the typhoon at this early stage... we have a robust contingency program in place in the event adverse weather looks likely to impact fixtures,\" they said in a statement.\n\nOrganizers can change the venue of a fixture or the timing if bad weather looks set to affect the match.\n\nHowever, if a match is cancelled during the pool stages of the tournament, it is awarded as a 0-0 draw.\n\nIn the case of the England-France game, this would send Eddie Jones's side through as Pool C champions and a quarterfinal meeting likely against Australia.\n\nA 0-0 draw would also guarantee Japan topping Pool A and another clash with the Springboks, whom they famously beat 34-32 in the 2015 \"Miracle of Brighton\" match.\n\nBut a cancellation would be a disaster for the Scots, who would be unable to progress assuming Ireland beat Samoa, as expected, the day before.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "A powerful typhoon that organizers have warned could impact the final weekend of the Rugby World Cup pool stage has changed course, leaving forecasters and pundits wondering which games might be affected and who could benefit.
