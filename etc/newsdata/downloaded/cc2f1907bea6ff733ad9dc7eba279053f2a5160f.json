I was used to being around a lot of children and from a young age, I knew that I wanted to have a traditional family.\n\nFor my generation and the generations before us, womxn particularly have been socially conditioned to make family the most important part of our lives. We\u2019re told to stay away from boys growing up, yet then deal with almost being hounded about marriage and babies as soon as we turn 21 \u2013 in my experience, this is especially the case within certain ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of us were taught \u2018home training\u2019 by our parents at a young age: being taught how to cook, clean and take care of the house. I was told to always serve the men in the house their food first \u2013 something that, to this day I still subconsciously do.\n\nBut we\u2019re now in 2019, and with the help of the feminist movement and general \u2018wokedom\u2019, we are now being conditioned to not see family as the pinnacle of success. Womxn are putting their careers ahead of settling down and are having children later in life. We have the freedom to travel, casually date, work, self care and just\u2026 live, without having the pressure to get a ring on it and get knocked up. Not only is it a freeing feeling, but honestly, it\u2019s about damn time.\n\nHowever, I still dream of getting married and having children.\n\nNot because I\u2019ve been conditioned by family or society to have kids by a certain age (my parents cut all that nagging out a very long time ago) and not because I feel peer pressure to settle down before a certain age, but because I love the prospect of having children, and having them with a partner.\n\nWhenever I\u2019ve shared this with some feminist friends of mine, I\u2019m always greeted with the same responses: \u2018But you don\u2019t HAVE to have a family Steph! We\u2019re in 2019 and we can do things on our own,\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t have to wait for a man in order to have a family, do it yourself!\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s a bit traditional and anti-feminist, no? Motherhood and marriage are oppressive!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrrrr.\n\nI thought the whole point of being a feminist was to acknowledge that womxm can have a choice to do whatever they want, however they want? Isn\u2019t that the whole point?\n\nI get that the conventions of heterosexual marriage can be problematic at best, and yes I am part of the whole \u2018MEN ARE TRASH!\u2019 crew from time to time, but a womxn wanting to be in a secure relationship and start a family shouldn\u2019t mean that they are all of a sudden, anti-feminist.\n\nYou can be a feminist and still hold on to some traditional values; the beauty of it being that it\u2019s not because we feel we have to, but because we want to. Isn\u2019t that the whole point?\n\nWhen I hop into social media and see fellow womxn being shamed for changing their last name to their husbands\u2019 upon getting married, it makes me feel incredibly sad. I\u2019m not down with the concept of putting others down to feel superior in your feminism.\n\nYes, marriage may historically be a sign of ownership, losing your surname could be interpreted as an erasure of one\u2019s identity, and the whole concept of having the \u2018virginal\u2019 white dress may be considered problematic but equally, it doesn\u2019t give anyone a right to feel morally superior to someone else because of the decisions they\u2019ve made about their own lives. That includes having children, or having the traditional fairytale wedding.\n\nThese days, I would like to think that people are getting married for love and long-term companionship; choosing to share your life with someone has absolutely nothing to do with your ability to be a feminist or empower women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, the archaic definition of marriage was problematic, but I\u2019d like to think that we\u2019ve come a long way from that now \u2013 I see it as something quite subjective and personal to the individual. It\u2019s more of a partnership, as opposed to someone belonging to someone else.\n\nBeing a feminist isn\u2019t necessarily about being a strong, independent woman who can do everything by herself. Granted, we can, and we\u2019ve been awesome at doing it for years, but one can be a feminist and still want to fall in love, want companionship and settle down. It shouldn\u2019t have to be a case of picking one or the other.\n\nAt the end of the day, the way in which we as millennials and Gen-Zers approach relationships and the prospect of settling down has changed drastically.\n\nWe are no longer bound by archaic norms, and we have the choice to create our own traditions and rulebooks as to how we think these ceremonies and family units should fall in place.\n\nAs feminists, we actually have the choice to decide what we want to do, and surely, shouldn\u2019t that be the most important thing?\n\nMORE: How to have feminist sex\n\nMORE: Kim Kardashian\u2019s body makeup isn\u2019t anti-feminist, it can be a lifeline for people like me\n\nMORE: Why all Dads must be feminists\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Stephanie Yeboah dismantles the idea that feminists should eschew all traditional values.", "authors": ["Stephanie Yeboah", "Award-Winning Blogger"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1133833685_1570437234.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
