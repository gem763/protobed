Revolution of our age!\u2019\n\nHe previously seemed to have no regrets about his outburst but following Blizzard\u2019s statement has said that, \u2018In the future I will be more careful\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on Twitch, he was unsure whether he would return to the Hearthstone pro scene and admitted he had not played the game since the incident.\n\n\u2018I wish Blizzard would reconsider the penalty of the two casters\u2019, he added.\n\nBlizzard\u2019s actions have been roundly criticised around the world, with some Western players also making pro-Hong Kong statements during their matches or exiting the scene in protest.\n\nOther gamers have tried to organise a boycott of all Activision Blizzard products, while Mei from Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch has been promoted as a protest symbol \u2013 in part in hope that it will lead to China banning the game.\n\nYou can read Blizzard\u2019s statement in full here, but it\u2019s the idea that Ng Wai would have been banned for life for making any political statement, not just one relating to China, that seems especially disingenuous.\n\nThat and the excuse for banning the casters, who literally hid under a table the second they realised what was going on.\n\n\u2018The specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision\u2019, claimed Blizzard president J. Allen Brack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We have these rules to keep the focus on the game and on the tournament to the benefit of a global audience, and that was the only consideration in the actions we took.\n\n\u2018If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same.\u2019\n\nAlthough Blizzard has moved slightly on the issue the equivalent statement by Chinese partner NetEase, as translated by IGN, takes a much sterner view of the situation:\n\n\u2018We express our strong indignation [or resentment] and condemnation of the events that occurred in the Hearthstone Asia Pacific competition last weekend and absolutely oppose the dissemination of personal political ideas during any events [or games]. The players involved will be banned, and the commentators involved will be immediately terminated from any official business. Also, we will protect [or safeguard] our national dignity [or honour].\u2019\n\nWhat would\u2019ve happened if Blizzard had allowed the comments, or reduced Ng Wai\u2019s ban more substantially, is unclear but that point is moot until the next conflict between Chinese interests and Western standards of free speech.\n\nRegarding Last Weekend\u2019s Hearthstone Grandmasters Tournamenthttps://t.co/4KAsV9HqP8 \u2014 Blizzard Entertainment (@Blizzard_Ent) October 12, 2019\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Top US Hearthstone caster quits in protest at Blizzard\u2019s Hong Kong policy\n\nMORE: Gamers organise Activision Blizzard boycott over Hong Kong protest ban\n\nMORE: Blizzard takes back Hearthstone winner\u2019s money for supporting Hong Kong protesters", "description": "The people at the centre of the Hearthstone pro-Hong Kong protests are still banned, as Blizzard claims China had nothing to do with it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hearthstone-blitzchung-ed55_1571039446.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
