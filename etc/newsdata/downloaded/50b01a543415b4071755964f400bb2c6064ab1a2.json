Recently, the brand came back on our radar when comedian Jacqueline Novak raved about its block heels when telling us about the things she can\u2019t live without. So it didn\u2019t come as a huge surprise when many of the cool women we spoke to for this story told us that Margaux topped their lists when it came to affordable black flats. \u201cMargaux\u2019s black flats are a staple that take me from parent-teacher conferences to dinner parties with friends to office meetings,\u201d says Luisana Mendoza de Roccia, a co-founder of Maisonette. De Roccia told us that she\u2019ll wear these flats with anything and that what she likes best is there\u2019s no breaking-in process \u2014 they\u2019re comfortable enough from the start. \u201cThese are truly made-to-measure, eliminating all those stops for Band-Aids and the need to carry around spare shoes,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you cannot beat the price.\u201d Hill House Home founder Nell Diamond is a fan, too, and says she loves the brand\u2019s \u201csimple, chic ballerina shape.\u201d Like de Roccia, Diamond says these work with any outfit and that they\u2019re her go-to for getting to work. \u201cI wear these as my \u2018commuter shoe,\u2019 as I\u2019m a heels girl once I\u2019m in the office,\u201d she says. \u201cI find these work with any outfit and are comfortable enough to walk in.\u201d", "description": "We talked to stylish women about the best black flats under $200, with ballet flats and loafers from Margaux, J.Crew, Everlane, Camper, Target, Bass, Yosi Samra, Sam Edelman, Madwell, and more.", "authors": ["Hilary Reid"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/10/19/black-flats/black-flats-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
