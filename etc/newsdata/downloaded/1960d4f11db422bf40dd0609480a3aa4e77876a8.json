With vast numbers of people crossing the world on planes every day, an equivalent air-borne outbreak now could spread globally in less than 36 hours and kill an estimated 50 million to 80 million people, wiping out nearly 5% of the global economy, it said.\n\nIn the case of a pandemic, many national health systems - particularly in poor countries - would collapse.\n\n\u201cPoverty and fragility exacerbate outbreaks of infectious disease and help create the conditions for pandemics to take hold,\u201d said Axel van Trotsenburg, acting chief executive of the World Bank and a member of the panel.\n\nCalling on governments to \u201cheed the lessons these outbreaks are teaching us\u201d and to \u201cfix the roof before the rain comes\u201d, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said they should invest in strengthening health systems, boost funds for research into new technologies, improve coordination and rapid communication systems, and monitor progress continually.\n\nThe WHO also warned earlier this year that another pandemic of flu - which is caused by airborne viruses - is inevitable, and said the world should prepare for it.", "description": "The world is facing a mounting threat of disease pandemics that could kill millions and wreak havoc on the global economy, a international expert panel has warned, and governments should work to prepare for and mitigate that risk.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
