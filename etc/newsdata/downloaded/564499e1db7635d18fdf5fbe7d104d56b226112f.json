The third day was about the tanking economy, and the fourth was for normal NEC business.\n\nAfter the meeting, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said that one of the key priorities was the implementation of the \u201cdistrict development model\u201d, which would aim \u201cto improve cooperative governance through realigning the three spheres of government to ensure joint planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring\u201d.\n\nWe await more details to see how this new model will actually enhance the functioning of local government, particularly when it comes to helping them provide basic services and boosting their financial viability.\n\nWe have been through so many \u201cinnovations\u201d in local government over the past 25 years that we can be forgiven for being cynical.\n\nEvery year, more municipalities sink into debt and are unable to pay salaries and other obligations.\n\nBut, disturbingly, irregular expenditure is also increasing. And, as the Auditor-General has pointed out, there are no consequences for those involved.\n\nAnother outcome of the NEC meeting was that government would lead the way in encouraging a culture of payment for services.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has made this call several times this year.\n\nBut, as the party is well aware, no one will listen to the NEC\u2019s words if they are not accompanied by an actual resolve to act on them at a local level.\n\nIn many municipalities across South Africa, residents are getting away with not paying for services. While the bleak economic situation means many poor people cannot afford to pay, there are many more people who can pay but choose not to.\n\nAs the example of people living in Soweto who won\u2019t pay their R18 billion bill for electricity demonstrates, they are aware that the governing party is afraid to antagonise its voting base by acting firmly and enforcing the law.\n\nSo, ultimately, all of the deep and serious deliberations that the ANC leadership engages in will amount to nothing if not accompanied by action.\n\nIt all feels like fiddling while Rome burns.", "description": "When the ANC\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) went into a special four-day meeting this week, it gave the nation the impression that the party\u2019s leaders were finally getting serious about fixing the country\u2019s problems.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7972/34ae6b8d59024e4a9cb1bc5e5a56db9e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
