That's another disaster waiting to happen.'\n\nA total of 1,860,200 applications had been received by September 30, Home Office data published on Wednesday said.\n\nBut latest internal figures showed the total had since risen to two million, the department announced. Some 520,600 were received in September.\n\nOverall, the total number of applications finalised by the end of September was more than 1.5 million (1,524,500).\n\nOf these, 61 per cent were granted full settled status, and 38 per cent were granted pre-settled status, which can be applied to be updated once someone has lived in the country continuously for five years.\n\nJust two applications were refused on 'suitability grounds', according to the statistics.\n\nOnce granted the status, people can live and work in the UK, use the NHS, study and access public funds and benefits, as well as travel in and out of the country.\n\nThe majority of applications (1,704,100) were received from people living in England, while 92,700 were received from Scotland, 29,300 from Wales and 28,700 from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe highest number of applicants came from Polish people (347,300), Romanians (280,600) and Italians (200,700).\n\nAround 88,500 eligible applications were also received from people living outside the EEA.\n\nThe scheme allows non-EEA relatives of EEA and Swiss citizens who all currently live in the UK under EU law to apply and obtain a status.\n\nThe figures are classed as experimental because they still in the testing phase and not fully developed so should be 'treated with caution', the Home Office paper warned.\n\nEU citizens and their families have until at least December 2020 to apply to the EU settlement scheme.\n\nThe scheme asks applicants to prove their identity, demonstrate they live in the UK, and declare any criminal convictions.\n\nA series of events to provide information about the scheme are to take place in Tower Hamlets in London, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Nottingham, Leeds and Birmingham, the department said, while there will be more adverts in the coming weeks as part of a \u00a34 million marketing campaign.", "description": "More than 500,000 people applied for the Government's EU Settlement Scheme in September alone, with the Brexit deadline approaching, according to Home Office statistics.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/13/19490952-0-image-a-47_1570625257045.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
