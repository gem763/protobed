The document alleged that Trump had used a July telephone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate a political rival, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, prompting a White House cover-up.\n\nThe push came even though there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump and his supporters deny that he did anything improper, but the White House has struggled to come up with a unified response.\n\nA second whistleblower with direct knowledge could undermine efforts by Trump and his allies to discredit the original complaint. They have called it politically motivated, claimed it was filed improperly and dismissed it as unreliable because it was based on secondhand or thirdhand information.\n\nA rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy, released by the White House, has already corroborated the complaint\u2019s central claim that Trump sought to pressure Ukraine on the investigation.\n\nText messages from State Department officials revealed other details, including that Ukraine was promised a visit with Trump if the government would agree to investigate the 2016 election and a Ukrainian gas company tied to Biden\u2019s son \u2014 the outline of a potential quid pro quo.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said word of a second whistleblower indicates a larger shift inside the government.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s real problem is that his behavior has finally gotten to a place where people are saying, \u2018Enough,'\u201d Himes said.\n\nDemocrats have zeroed in on the State Department in the opening phase of their impeachment investigation. The Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees have already interviewed Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine who provided the text messages, and least two other witnesses are set for depositions this week: Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly ousted as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of Trump\u2019s most vocal backers, provided perhaps the strongest defense of the Republican president. He said there was nothing wrong with Trump\u2019s July conversation with Zelenskiy and said the accusations look like a \u201cpolitical setup.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump, rather than visiting his nearby golf course in Sterling, Virginia, for a second day, he stayed at the White House on Sunday, where he tweeted and retweeted, with the Bidens a main target.\n\n\u201cThe great Scam is being revealed!\u201d Trump wrote at one point, continuing to paint himself as the victim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d and hostile Democrats.\n\nAside from Trump\u2019s attempt to pressure Zelenskiy, the July call has raised questions about whether Trump held back near $400 million in critical American military aid to Ukraine as leverage for an investigation of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of Burisma at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Ukraine. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nJoe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, wrote in The Washington Post that he had a message for Trump and \u201cthose who facilitate his abuses of power. \u2026 Please know that I\u2019m not going anywhere. You won\u2019t destroy me, and you won\u2019t destroy my family.\u201d\n\nAdditional details about the origins of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelenskiy have emerged over the weekend.\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry had encouraged Trump to speak with the Ukrainian leader, but on energy and economic issues, according to spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes. She said Perry\u2019s interest in Ukraine is part of U.S. efforts to boost Western energy ties to Eastern Europe.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly has described his conversation with Zelenskiy as \u201cperfect,\u201d told House Republicans on Friday night that it was Perry who teed up the July call, according to a person familiar with Trump\u2019s comments who was granted anonymity to discuss them. The person said Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure to investigate the Bidens.\n\nHimes appeared on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d while Graham spoke on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram, Ellen Knickmeyer and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House Democrats leading an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine may have fresh information to work with", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/07/4ccf12_trump-92477-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-talks-reporters-on-south-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
