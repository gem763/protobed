Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWeatherspoon, 53, most recently served as director of player and franchise development for the WNBA\u2019s New York Liberty. Her main focus at New Orleans will be to work with players on two-way contracts such as Josh Gray and Zylan Cheatham. Such contracts allow teams to shuttle the players between the NBA roster and the club\u2019s G League affiliate.\n\nAJ Diggs was also hired in a similar role, according to the Pelicans. Weatherspoon and Diggs will also work closely with the club\u2019s G League team, the Erie BayHawks.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to welcome and AJ and Teresa to our coaching staff here in New Orleans,\u201d Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said in a statement. \u201cAs we continue to put an increased emphasis on player development, AJ and Teresa will play an integral role with our younger players and will be a huge asset to our players and staff both here in New Orleans and Erie.\u201d\n\n\u2014Memphis Grizzlies guard De\u2019Anthony Melton will be sidelined for four to eight weeks due to a stress reaction in his back, the team announced. He was acquired from the Phoenix Suns in the offseason, and averaged 5.0 points, 3.2 assists and 2.7 rebounds in 50 games (31 starts) for the Suns as a rookie last season.\n\nMemphis also announced that rookie point guard Ja Morant is fully recovered from the arthroscopic knee surgery he underwent in June. Morant was the No. 2 overall choice in the 2019 draft out of Murray State.\n\nThe Grizzlies also said that forwards Dillon Brooks (right big toe) and Jaren Jackson Jr. (thigh) are fully recovered from injuries sustained last season. Jackson averaged 13.8 points and 4.7 rebounds in 58 games (56 starts) last season, and Brooks averaged 7.5 points in 18 games. Forward Kyle Anderson, who averaged 8.0 points and 5.8 rebounds in 43 games (40 starts) last season, is still recovering from thoracic outlet decompression surgery performed in April.\n\n\u2014Free throws will be less frequent and will potentially carry more weight this season in the NBA G League after an experimental rule change for the 2019-20 season was announced.\n\nPlayers will attempt only one free throw that will be worth one, two or three points depending on the number of foul shots that would have been awarded under standard NBA rules.\n\nThe rule will not apply to the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or the entirety of any overtime period.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The New Orleans Pelicans hired WNBA legend and Hall of Famer Teresa Weatherspoon as a two-way player development coach, the team announced Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434344720&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q01Z-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
