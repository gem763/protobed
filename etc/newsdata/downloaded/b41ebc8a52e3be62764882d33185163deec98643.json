Then the entire membership will have to give its approval.\n\n___\n\n12:50 p.m.\n\nMany workers who are on strike against General Motors say they're ready to go back to work now that their union has agreed to a tentative four-year contract with the company.\n\nThe United Auto Workers union announced Wednesday morning that it had reached a deal that could end the monthlong strike. Workers will stay on the picket lines at least until Thursday, when factory-level union officials meet to sign off on the deal. It also has to be ratified by the union's 49,000 members at GM.\n\nMark Nichols, a worker at the GM transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, says his savings are running low. He thought the strike would only last a week or two.\n\n___\n\n11:40 a.m.\n\nThe United Auto Workers and General Motors have reached a tentative contract agreement that could end a monthlong strike that brought the automaker's U.S. factories to a standstill.\n\nThe deal was hammered out Wednesday but it won't immediately end the strike by more than 49,000 workers. They're likely to stay on the picket lines at least a few more days until union committees vote on the deal. The entire membership also must vote.\n\nDetails of the four-year agreement have yet to be released.\n\nWorkers left their jobs early Sept. 16. They wanted a bigger share of GM's profits, job security and a path to permanent jobs for temporary workers.\n\nThe company wanted to reduce labor costs so they're closer to U.S. factories run by foreign automakers.", "description": "The United Auto Workers union's top bargainer with General Motors says a tentative deal with the company will bring \"major gains\" to workers.
