And while many praised the whistleblower whose complaint resulted in the release of the transcripts, Giuliani denied that it was an abuse of power by the president and congratulated himself for exposing Biden.\n\n\"I actually think they should all congratulate me because if it weren't for me, nobody would have uncovered and faced massive corruption by the vice president of the United States. In fact, I'm a legitimate whistleblower,\" proclaimed Giuliani.\n\nBiden has repeatedly denied Giuliani's corruption allegations. Biden echoed that denial on Wednesday when he told Jimmy Kimmel that no credible journalist had found any evidence that supports the corruption claims.\n\nIn response, Giuliani told Ingraham, \"I can't look at Biden. I have a visceral reaction to a man that sells public office. And he's been doing it since he was a senator.\"\n\nGiuliani also called out Senator Kamala Harris for not understanding the Sixth Amendment after she spoke out against the former mayor in a couple of interviews earlier in the day.\n\n\"If Kamala Harris weren't a phony, she would be saying I'm shocked that a vice president of the United States sold out his office for $8 million and we haven't gotten to China yet or at least sold out his office again,\" added Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani then took aim at Republican Senator Mitt Romney, who called the transcripts of Trump's call with Ukraine \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d Addressing Romney's remarks, Giuliani said, \"Look, Mitt. Trump did what you couldn't do. Trump has the ability to relate to people; you don't. That's always been true.\"\n\nEven Trump's administration wasn't safe from Giuliani. Ingraham asked if there was any truth to a New York Times reporter's claim that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was unhappy with the former mayor for his problematic public remarks. Giuliani fired back: \"His state department, you know, asked me to do this. So Mike, if you're unhappy with me, I'm sorry, but I accomplished my mission.\n\nAmong those unhappy with Giuliani is POMPEO, per multiple sources. Among other things, he believes Giuliani's public statements have been problematic as as his involvement overall with the Ukraine issue. \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) September 25, 2019\n\nIn the end, Giuliani didn't seem to be fazed by all the attacks. He told Ingraham that he predicted this would happen. \"The minute I laid out the evidence against Biden, they were going to kill me. They're going to try to kill me. I told my colleague, \u2018too bad Biden's involved in this, those Washington swamp people are going to come after me like crazy,\u2019\" added Giuliani\n\nThe Ingraham Angle airs weeknights at 10 p.m. on Fox.\n\nSee why Al Franken found the public apologies from fellow senators \u2018very gratifying\u2019\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\n\n\nTell us what you think!
