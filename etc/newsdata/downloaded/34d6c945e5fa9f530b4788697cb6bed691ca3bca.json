Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) presidential campaign.\n\nThe progressive political outfit\u2019s move bolsters Warren\u2019s left-wing credentials as she continues to gain ground on former Vice President Joe Biden in the polls. It also signals a growth in support for Warren among the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing as she and Sanders challenge Biden's frontrunner status.\n\nThe endorsement process stretched for three months and included live question-and-answer sessions with the candidates in contention for the backing. According to the party, Warren earned almost 61 percent of the vote in the first round of ranked-choice voting, followed by Sanders on almost 36 percent. More than 80 percent of voters listed Warren and Sanders as their top two picks.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,\u201d said Working Families Party national director Maurice Mitchell. \u201cOur job now is to help Senator Warren build the mass movement that will make her transformational plans a reality.\u201d\n\nAlthough Sanders did not earn this cycle\u2019s endorsement, as he did in 2016, Mitchell said that the organization is glad to see both of the candidates in the race.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have two strong progressive candidates leading in this race,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cSenator Warren and Senator Sanders have both shaped the ideological terrain on which this campaign is being waged. They have proven an effective team on debate stages and in the polls, and we hope that partnership continues. We\u2019re proud to call both of them allies in the fight for a more just America.\u201d\n\nWFP had initially chosen six candidates to do Q&A sessions for possible endorsements, including: Warren, Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Harris ended up being excluded from contention when she was unable to attend the scheduled session.\n\nThe endorsement comes as Warren is set to speak in New York City on Monday night after unveiling a sweeping anti-corruption plan.", "description": "The Democratic senator won 60.91 percent of the WFP vote, followed by Sanders, whom the left-wing party endorsed in the 2016 primary.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1432,w_2547,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568647509/warren_wfp_yqjzhf", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
