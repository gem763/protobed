However, when her best friend Phil wishes to die, Bina is reluctant to help.\n\nWritten in brief fragments, Bina explores female friendships, love and death through darkness and humour.\n\nTake heed\n\n\"The novel is told in warnings. I'm fascinated by language and form \u2014 my way in when writing a book is always to find form. A warning is one of the earliest languages that we are exposed to. We are warned at the beginning of life \u2014 'Don't touch this,' or 'Leave that alone!'\n\n\"I thought, 'Why not have a language of warnings upon exit?' I've made a lot of mistakes in my life and I have great respect for my elders, my elder women especially. I like the idea that older women would be giving me the warnings like, 'Watch out you're going to face seven years of perimenopause,' or 'Don't eat mangoes!'\n\nA warning is one of the earliest languages that we are exposed to. We are warned at the beginning of life \u2014 'Don't touch this,' or 'Leave that alone!' - Anakana Schofield\n\n\"I'm obviously joking, but there's a serious interrogation into our exit that is absent and missing. For some reason, it's the subject of mass avoidance.\"\n\nAn ordinary-extraordinary woman\n\n\"Bina is some woman for one woman. That's how I describe her. She's had enough at the beginning of the novel and she's been arrested for assisting people to end their lives. The novel is set in Ireland, a country where medical assistance for dying is illegal. She's awaiting trial. She's a single, solitary woman who knows there is nobody coming to help her. No one is going to save Bina.\n\nAs a writer, as a person who attempts to create literary art, my chosen approach is to posit philosophical questions that often perturb me in a literary manner. - Anakana Schofield\n\n\"She's walking toward the edge of the planet and she's shouting behind her warnings to us to help us to carry on.\"\n\nFace our fear\n\n\"We are all going to die. Every single day, we are one step closer to dying. Some of us will die sooner than others. And yet every single day, it's a 24-hour avoidance of that subject. As a writer, as a person who attempts to create literary art, my chosen approach is to posit philosophical questions that often perturb me in a literary manner.\n\n\"Writing fiction is the place to do that.\"\n\nAnakana Schofield's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "The Irish-Canadian author explores the nature of death, dying and getting older with her third novel.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4941532.1570208557!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/anakana-schofield-bina.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
