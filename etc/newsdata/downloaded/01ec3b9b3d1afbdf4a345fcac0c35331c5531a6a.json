And I think that the love that was shown on the show, it was genuine between all of us cast members and I think people pick up on that,\u201d Olsen told Fox News in reference to why the show has managed to stand the test of time so many years after its television exit.\n\nBut she didn't always feel that positive.\n\n\u201cI never thought I would say this because when I was younger I was very rebellious and I really hated the fact that I was in such a wholesome show with American values and family values. But guess what \u2013 now I'm so proud of that,\u201d added Olsen while attending the Jose Iturbi Foundation\u2019s rooftop dinner \"Under the Stars\" event at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nThe animal rights activist said she appreciates that people saw the Brady family as something they could aspire their households to be and explained that it was actually the role of Cindy Brady itself that helped Olsen come into her own as a young woman.\n\n\u201cI think that being an actress helped me to grow. I don't really think that the show helped me to grow so much as people that watched the show learned to grow,\u201d shared Olsen. \u201cPeople would ask me, 'Don't you wish that 'The Brady Bunch' was your real family?' And I'm like no \u2013 because my family is just as good and they're a little bit funnier, a little weirder, but I know so many people that literally say that the show saved their lives.\u201d\n\nSUSAN OLSEN TALKS 'A VERY BRADY RENOVATION,' SAYS VOTING FOR TRUMP GOT HER IN TROUBLE ON RADIO SHOW\n\nShe continued: \u201cAnd you know, I had a great family life but for people \u2013 and other people that had a great family life loved it too-- but there were people that didn't have a great life and as children, they depended on the show. And it's for them that I really feel responsible.\u201d\n\nThe radio host said she never wanted to become an actress and simply used it as a means of helping her to focus on other avenues where her interests laid.\n\n\u201cWell, I didn't pursue having a career in acting. I did at first because I just didn't have much imagination,\u201d Olsen explained. \u201cI thought, 'I've got my foot in the door with something that everybody wants,' and it took me a while to realize that I didn't want it. Acting is not really my medium \u2013 I'm a creative person, but I prefer visual arts.\n\n\u201cBut now I'm teaching acting for kids among other things, so I love it but it's not really my thing,\u201d Olsen said, adding that she loves Cindy Brady for allowing her to connect with fans.\n\n\u2018BRADY BUNCH\u2019 CASTMATES ASK FOR FANS' HELP TO FIND ICONIC ITEMS FROM HOME\n\n\u201cAs far as careers go, you know, Cindy Brady has certainly been a good ambassador. She opens doors, people have a nice feeling about me and they may not know why. [They say] 'Gee, I just feel like I grew up with you.' I'm like, 'Oh, that's nice,'\u201d said Olsen.\n\nWhen asked if fans of the series are ever surprised at her rebellious nature and problem with authority, Olsen said yes, adding that Cindy really wasn\u2019t that smart to begin with.\n\n\u201cI think people generally are happily surprised when they find out that my tastes were not quite so wholesome,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I was very into punk rock and rock music and I'm really outspoken. So I'm definitely not Cindy, but I don't want to be the anti-Cindy because she was fairly nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe just wasn't very bright,\u201d Olsen added with a laugh.\n\n\u2018MARY TYLER MOORE\u2019 STAR ED ASNER SAYS CAST WAS LIKE A FAMILY: \u2018WE FORGAVE EACH OTHER\u2019S FAULTS'\n\nToday, Olsen says she\u2019s having the time of life and said when she isn\u2019t teaching acting classes or listening to her rock and roll, she passes her time with video games and cellphone apps that keep her mind sharp.\n\n\u201cI play 'World of Warcraft,\u2019\" Olsen said. \u201cI am a big gamer kind of person, yeah. I'm not very good at fast things, but the strategies I'm good at.\u201d\n\nOlsen continued: \u201cI do some of those mental [exercises] deliberately because I'm not getting any younger. I do some of those apps on the phone. I try to keep frosty and try to learn new things. I teach children \u2013 I teach a filmmaking class where we just put together a little film and just keeping up with the technology in video is a constant challenge.\u201d\n\nOlsen said she had no more secrets she could share from the old \u201cBrady Bunch\u201d set, telling us that \u201cBarry [Williams] told all and then some because a lot of what he told in his book \u2018Growing Up Brady\u2019 didn\u2019t actually happen if you read the book.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cYeah I mean we all, we weren't really related, we didn't really share a house \u2013 so yeah, we kind of tended to date each other, although I was too young to date,\u201d said Olsen.\n\n\u201cBut we made out in the dog house,\u201d she added. \u201cI mean we were just such good kids. We were a lot like the characters and in fact, we didn't argue as much as the characters because we didn't have to share one bathroom with no toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat can make people cranky,\u201d Olsen said with amusement.", "description": "Susan Olsen has enjoyed many of the spoils that came with being a child actor on the legendary family sitcom.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Getty_ETHandout_SusanOlsen_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
