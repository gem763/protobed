USA TODAY\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany \u2014 Simone Biles is the last person international gymnastics officials should be using to try and make a point.\n\nIn an effort to deter other gymnasts from trying skills they are not physically capable of doing, the International Gymnastics Federation watered down the value of a new element Biles plans to do at the world championships. That\u2019s right. Penalize the reigning world and Olympic champion, who is almost cautious when it comes to adding difficulty, for the potential recklessness of others.\n\n\u201cAm I in a league of my own? Yes. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t credit me for what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Biles told NBC after learning of the decision this week by the women\u2019s technical committee.\n\nSimone Biles performs on the vault during a training session in preparation for the world championships in Germany. (Photo: Thomas Kienzle, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThey keep asking us to do more difficulty and to give more artistry, give more harder skills,\u201d she added. \u201cSo we do, and then they don\u2019t credit it, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\nEvery element in gymnastics is assigned a letter, which corresponds to a numerical value. An \u201cA\u201d skill is worth a tenth of a point, and every letter in the alphabet that follows is an additional tenth. So a \u201cD\u201d skill is four-tenths of a point while the rare \u201cJ\u201d skill is worth a full point.\n\nBiles is doing two new skills at worlds: a triple-twisting, double somersault on floor exercise and a double-twisting, double somersault dismount off balance beam. The triple-double was valued as a J skill, while the double-double was only deemed to be an H.\n\nNEVER GETS OLD: 44-year-old gymnast has to wait to see if she qualified for Olympics\n\nAfter widespread criticism of its decision, the women\u2019s technical committee (WTC) released a statement Friday explaining its reasoning:\n\n\u201cIn assigning values to the new elements, the WTC takes into consideration many different aspects; the risk, the safety of the gymnasts and the technical direction of the discipline,\u201d it said. \u201cThere is added risk in landing of double saltos for beam dismounts (with/without twists), including a potential landing on the neck.\n\n\u201cReinforcing, there are many examples \u2026 where decisions have been made to protect the gymnasts and preserve the direction of the discipline.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Some gymnasts are trying to pad their scores by chucking skills they have no business doing, and we need to protect them from themselves.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of hypocrisy in that rationale. If the federation is so concerned with athlete safety, why allow I and J skills in the first place? If Biles\u2019 double-double is going to encourage gymnasts to take risks they shouldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t her triple-double do the same?\n\nAnd, while we\u2019re at it, why not allow gymnasts to do a warm-up on the floor before event finals?\n\nMost bothersome, though, is that the federation has ignored the means it has to keep irresponsible impulses in check.\n\nIn addition to the difficulty score \u2013 the sum value of all the elements in a routine \u2013 there is an execution score. If a gymnast insists on trying a skill he or she has no business doing \u2013 some of you vaulters, you know who you are \u2013 hammer them on the E score.\n\nGive them a three or a four \u2013 a normal E score for an elite gymnast is in the 8s or 9s \u2013 and it will nullify whatever advantage there was in the added difficulty.\n\nBut no. The federation would rather shortchange Biles of the true value of her accomplishment.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly difficult dismount and you make it look 'too easy,' \u201d Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles along with her husband, Laurent, said on Twitter. \u201cKeep doing YOU.\u201d\n\nThe great irony in all of this is that Biles is decidedly prudent when it comes to increasing her difficulty.\n\nThe new skills she\u2019s doing at worlds are ones she \u201cplayed around with\u201d long before she considered putting them in a routine. Even once she warmed to the idea, it took months, sometimes years, for her to decide the skill was ready to be done in competition.\n\n\u201cHe has all these crazy ideas,\u201d Biles said of Laurent Landi. \u201cThen he has to kind of push me toward it until I\u2019m ready to do it myself. And then I\u2019m like, `OK, it\u2019s not that bad.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere are plenty of times the federation would do well to hold Biles up as an example. This is not one of them.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "description": "Simone Biles has a new element to do at the world championships, but the value of it is being watered down to keep other gymnasts from trying it.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
