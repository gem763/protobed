indications have shown a swell of support from developers and the public,\u201d according to the accounts, which were signed off by Mr Trump\u2019s son Eric.\n\nHowever the plans prompted objections from government watchdog Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and several locals angry about the potential environmental damage to the nearby coastline.\n\nOne member of the public from Stirling stated that \u201cthis money-making endeavour for Mr Donald Trump will once again severely affect the natural habitat and landscape of Scotland, a country that he is interested in only for its economic value, and for which he does not mind destroying to make himself a profit.\u201d\n\nExperts said the existing course had already \u201ddestroyed\u201d the ecosystem, causing permanent habitat loss, and in June the SNH consulted over plans to remove its status as a site of special scientific interest.\n\nWhen Mr Trump first announced his plans for the resort in 2006, he claimed it would create 6,000 jobs. At present the company employs 77 people, a reduction of seven staff since 2017.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump remain directors of the firm, along with Trump Organisation CEO Alan Weisselberg.\n\nThe president\u2019s Turnberry golf resort in Ayrshire posted a loss of more than \u00a33m in 2017.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s first UK golf resort \u2013 which he boasted was \u201cthe greatest in the world\u201d\u00a0six months ago \u2013 has lost money for the seventh year in a row.", "authors": ["Peter Stubley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/05/16/trump-golf-menie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
