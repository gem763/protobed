So much more to come.\"\n\nRita and Liam\u2019s chemistry has been a bone of contention for Cheryl, who was forced to confronted the former One Direction star about their behaviour following the steamy TV appearance last year.\n\nIn order to placate Cheryl, it is claimed that Rita and Liam agreed to tone down their on-stage flirting.\n\nHowever, the hands-off approach did not go amiss as the pair avoided any physical contact during a performance together at the Brit Awards just three weeks later.\n\nCheryl and Liam broke up five months later but insisted the end of their two-year relationship had nothing to do with Rita.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
