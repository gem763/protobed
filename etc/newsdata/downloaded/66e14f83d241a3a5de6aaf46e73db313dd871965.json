Now that we have a destination, we need to have a second referendum,\u201d said Douglas Hill, 35, on the march with his Estonian wife.\n\nThe leader of the main opposition Labour party, which opposed the Brexit deal, echoed this.\n\n\u201cWe will not back this sell-out deal,\u201d Jeremy Corbyn said.\n\nHe added: \u201cVoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit. It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say.\u201d\n\nAn online Survation poll of 1,025 adults on Thursday and Friday for the Daily Mail found that 50 percent said MPs should vote for the deal, while 38 percent said not.\n\nEU leaders in Brussels this week urged lawmakers to back the deal to allow both sides to move on to discussing their future relationship.\n\nThe deal covers Britain\u2019s financial settlement, protects the rights of EU citizens and sets out a post-Brexit transition period potentially until 2022 to allow both sides to agree new trade terms.\n\nburs-ar/phz/dt", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British MPs voted Saturday to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask the European Union to delay Brexit yet again but he insisted", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/d9e7c0_britain-prime-minister-boris-johnson-brexit-delay-pointless-deeply-corrosive-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
