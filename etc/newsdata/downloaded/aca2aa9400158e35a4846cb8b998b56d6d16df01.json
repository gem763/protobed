Stay on marked paths. Respect locals. Don\u2019t feed the wildlife.\n\nThese are just a sample of the pledges that global destinations from Aspen to New Zealand are seeking from visitors, all in the name of easing the burden of mass tourism. Although the promises largely come without any enforcement tool, some experts believe they are valuable for setting expectations for travelers and spelling out the moral burden of tourism.\n\n\u201cI think there is, without a doubt, a strong and valuable education element,\u201d says Gregory Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsible Travel. \u201cRelated to that is just a general awareness of the tremendous natural, cultural, historical values of a particular destination.\u201d\n\nAnother element, Miller says, is \u201can important commitment \u2014 and that\u2019s one of making choices and showing good behavior.\u201d\n\n[We\u2019re in the age of the overtourist. You can avoid being one of them.]\n\nIceland \u2014 which has become a case study for the rapid rise of mass tourism \u2014 introduced the Icelandic Pledge in mid-2017, urging tourists to be responsible by heeding several rules. They include not venturing off roads, using designated campsites if staying outdoors, parking in approved areas and practicing safe selfies.\n\n\u201cI will take photos to die for, without dying for them,\u201d one line says. Another gets down to business: \u201cWhen nature calls, I won\u2019t answer the call on nature.\u201d\n\nSigridur Dogg Gudmundsdottir, public relations manager for Visit Iceland, says nearly 70,000 people have signed so far. They can do so online or at the airport, where they can press a button at a display and see the number of pledges increase in front of them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to speak to the honor code in tourists that are coming to Iceland, and we don\u2019t want to forbid too much,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d much rather send the message in a benign way and ask people to join us in this venture to be responsible and preserve the beautiful nature of Iceland.\u201d\n\n[A local\u2019s guide to Reykjavik, Iceland]\n\nOther destinations followed, including Bend, Ore.; Big Sur, Calif.; the island of Hawaii with its Pono Pledge; and New Zealand with its Tiaki Promise. Finland introduced its Sustainable Finland Pledge last month. Aspen, Colo., launched its own pledge last year, and the Aspen Chamber Resort Association has tied it in to a campaign to \u201ctag responsibly\u201d by not using geotags on Instagram photos of sites that are at risk of becoming trampled by tourists.\n\nMany of the pledges include common themes: treat the destination respectfully, don\u2019t leave trash behind, stay on marked paths and sleep at official campsites. Safety over social media is another constant. (\u201cI won\u2019t risk life or limb [human or sapling] for more likes,\u201d reads Bend\u2019s pledge.) And some are extremely specific to their destinations. Hawaii\u2019s Pono Pledge notes: \u201cMolten lava will mesmerize me, but I will not disrupt its flow.\u201d\n\n\n\n(From the Palau Pledge)\n\nPalau, a Pacific Ocean archipelago, says it is the first country to change its immigration laws to require all visitors to sign a promise in their actual passports \u2014 addressed to the nation\u2019s children \u2014 when they enter the country. More than 239,000 people have signed on since the Palau Pledge was implemented in late 2017.\n\n\u201cThe Pledge was deemed necessary after careless behavior from visitors started to erode Palau\u2019s pristine environment and have a negative impact on its culture,\u201d the initiative\u2019s website says. It notes that the government passed policies that subject visitors who break the pledge\u2019s conditions to fines up to $1 million.\n\nNo other pledges appear to carry a threat of a fine, though some warn against behavior that is against the law. The Icelandic Pledge, for example, includes this promise: \u201cI will follow the road into the unknown, but never venture off the road.\u201d Gudmundsdottir said people can get fined for driving off the road, but that\u2019s not connected to the pledge.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the law of the country,\u201d she says.\n\nLikewise, in Finland, littering can result in a fine or up to two years in prison, according to Liisa Kokkarinen, the project manager at Visit Finland responsible for Sustainable Travel Finland. And people might face fines or other legal ramifications for unknowingly violating Finland\u2019s \u201ceveryman\u2019s rights\u201d by fishing without a permit, leaving marked paths or taking natural resources from protected areas.\n\n\u201cThe pledge is meant to protect travelers visiting Finland and make them aware of these general rules and responsibilities,\u201d Kokkarinen said in an email. \u201cBecause visitors may not know about the different rules in nature areas, the pledge offers a way to guide them towards the respectful behavior that is expected of them while visiting Finland.\u201d\n\n[These are the cities overtourism could threaten next]\n\nIn addition to educating tourists on how to be more responsible, Kokkarinen said, the pledge is a guide for people to travel the way most people say they want to these days: like a local.\n\n\u201cThe pledge gives a window to travelers to \u2018be like a Finn,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cMany tourists appreciate the culture and environment they are visiting, and seek ways to act like the locals to get more in-depth destination experience.\u201d\n\nSome pledges have gone beyond promises and moved into a different sphere of action: raising money. Pledge for the Wild, which launched this summer, is an initiative by five mountain towns \u2014 Bend; Bozeman, Mont.; Flagstaff, Ariz.; Steamboat Springs, Colo.; and South Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada \u2014 that encourages visitors to donate to keep up public spaces.\n\n\u201cWe invite you to consider a pledge of $1/hour for the time you spend mountain biking, hiking to epic peaks or wild flower meadows, fishing pristine rivers and waterways, or any of the other epic adventures you\u2019ve just had,\u201d the website says. It provides codes that people can text to a number to make the donation, with money going to organizations in each community that maintain trails or other public spaces.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really talking about is changing the way a visitor visits a destination and the ways in which they have a financial impact on that destination,\u201d says Kevney Dugan, president and chief executive of Visit Bend, who helped launch Pledge for the Wild. His own organization introduced the Bend Pledge in 2017, but he realized there was potential to ask for more from visitors.\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t pledge money, we believe that this effort is also going to make you think a little more about where you\u2019re visiting, how your visit impacts that destination and be a little more thoughtful about how to recreate in those spaces,\u201d Dugan says.\n\nRead more:\n\nA selfie ban in the Czech Republic is the latest effort to combat bad tourist behavior\n\nTell us what you think of By The Way\n\nA girl took a heart-shaped rock from a national park.
