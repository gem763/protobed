She took time to get going but rallied to beat the former world number one 14-21 21-17 21-18.\n\nMarin slumped on the court and broke into tears as Tai sent a forehand crosscourt shot wide on match point.\n\n\u201cI cannot describe my feelings right now because I\u2019m so happy,\u201d Marin was quoted as saying by the Badminton World Federation on its website.\n\n\u201cThere was some frustration with myself in the first game. I tried to keep calm. I had to be patient and find the good length on the shuttle. But the most important thing is I could fight until the end.\n\n\u201cI just waited until she made mistakes. I just wanted to play some long rallies because I knew this match was going to be really tough. She has good strokes, she has so much deception that I had to be careful.\u201d\n\nTai found her opponent more skillful than before.\n\n\u201cThe wind was coming from a different direction compared to the past few days. I made quick adjustments at the start of the match but towards the end, she played at a very fast pace,\u201d Tai said.\n\n\u201cI also made many unforced errors. But I have to admit that she played very well today.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s not much difference, she is still very fast. I also feel that she is more skillful now. I also noticed that she maintained her speed in every match. She is much better at the net and has more variety of shots.\u201d", "description": "Olympic champion Carolina Marin made a successful comeback on Sunday by defending her China Open title eight months after suffering a career-threatening injury.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432600971&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0A7", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
