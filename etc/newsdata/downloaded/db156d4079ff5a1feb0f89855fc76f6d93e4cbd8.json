We will get through this,\" Odessa Mayor David Turner said Monday on \"Shepard Smith Reporting.\"\n\nThe gunman killed seven people and injured at least 22 others Saturday before officers killed him outside a busy movie theater in Odessa, investigators said.\n\nOfficials said those killed were between 15 and 57 years old but did not immediately provide a list of names. Family and employers, however, said that among the dead were Edwin Peregrino, 25, who ran out of his parents\u2019 home to see what the commotion was; mail carrier Mary Granados, 29, killed in her U.S. Postal Service truck; and 15-year-old high school student Leilah Hernandez, who had been walking out of an auto dealership.\n\nThe attack began Saturday afternoon when Texas state troopers tried pulling over a gold car on Interstate 20 for failing to signal a left turn. Before the vehicle came to a complete stop, the driver \u201cpointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots\u201d toward the patrol car stopping him, according to Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger. The gunshots struck a trooper, Cesinger said, after which the gunman took off and continued shooting. He fired at random as he drove in the area of Odessa and Midland, two cities over 300 miles west of Dallas.\n\nPolice used a marked SUV to ram the mail truck outside the Cinergy Movie Theater in Odessa, disabling the vehicle. The gunman then fired at police, wounding two officers before he was killed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe shooting came at the end of an already violent month in Texas following the El Paso attack at a Walmart that killed 22 people.\n\nFox News' Trace Gallagher contributed to this report.", "description": "The gunman in a West Texas rampage that killed seven people \"was on a long spiral down\" before he was fired from his job on the day of the shooting, according to authorities.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
