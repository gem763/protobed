I love to build things, so we will see,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAt this point you don\u2019t rule out anything, I think with the men\u2019s game, there are lot of differences, a lot of similarities. The financial part is much, much bigger but the game is the game,\u201d she said.\n\nFrance\u2019s national women\u2019s team coach Corinne Diacre coached in the men\u2019s second division in her homeland with Clermont Foot.\n\nEllis said Diacre\u2019s experience, along with women taking differing coaching roles in various sports, showed that the barriers were coming down.\n\n\u201cWe have had Corinne, we have had women who have coached men\u2019s teams. I don\u2019t think it I anything out of the realm of comprehension, we have female coaches in the States, in the NBA, in the NFL, I think it is about ability and proficiency not gender,\u201d she said.\n\nThe English-born coach, who has been part of the U.S Soccer Federation\u2019s coaching system since 2000, having previously worked at college-level, said she expected her farewell to be moving.\n\n\u201cI am sure, it will be emotional, I will have a lot of friends and family coming, it will mean a lot. It will be moving. I will always have a connection with the players and the staff.\n\n\u201cIt will be tough though, there will be a couple of tears maybe. I was always a fan before I took over with this team and I will continue to be so,\u201d she said.", "description": "United States women's World Cup winning coach Jill Ellis says she is not ruling out a switch to the men's game after she stands down from her role next month.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432653596&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0JD", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
