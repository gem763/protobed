Meanwhile, opposition to impeachment rose from 47% to 49%.\n\nThat\u2019s still higher than the 37% support Quinnipiac found Sept. 25, before Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry got fully underway. And the poll said a majority of those surveyed approve of Democrats\u2019 inquiry.\n\nThe key swing group is independents, who are slightly in favor of the investigation but slightly opposed to actually taking the step of impeachment itself.\n\nRepublicans are adamantly opposed, with just 6% backing impeachment, while Democrats are mostly in favor, at 85%.\n\n\u201cDespite a week of blistering partisan exchanges, the sound and fury over whistleblowers and impeachment, the needle hardly moves,\u201d said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy. \u201cThe country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office, and his base remains granite solid.\u201d\n\nThe poll also tested Democratic presidential candidates and found Sen. Elizabeth Warren still holding a lead nationally, with 29% support among primary voters. She was trailed by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden at 26% and Sen. Bernard Sanders at 16%. No other candidate topped 4%, the pollsters said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
