Bright and David Crane were pitching the show, told The Scotsman: \"You just don't know how is it when a group of people come together and, if you forgive the expression, make beautiful music together, is that going to be for a generation or is it going to be for the ages?\"\n\nComparing them to rock 'n' roll legends The Beatles, he said: \"I think with The Beatles we can safely say it's for the ages. It's possible with 'Friends' it's the same thing.\"\n\n\"Friends\" first hit our screens on Sept. 22, 1994, and ran for 10 years.\n\nIt was based on a group of six 20-somethings living in New York, with the on-off romance between Ross and Rachel being one of the main themes.\n\nNow it seems \"Friends\" is arguably more popular today than it was during its tenth and final season, with its six stars reportedly earning $20 million (\u00a316.1 million) a year through reruns alone.\n\nMeanwhile, die-hard fans who have been waiting for a \"Friends\" reunion had better not hold their breath.\n\n'FRIENDS' CREATORS CONFIRM THERE WON'T BE A REUNION SERIES\n\nAlthough Jen thought her castmates would be up for reprising their roles, telling Ellen De Generes \"Anything could happen,\" Lisa - who played Phoebe Buffay - recently dismissed the idea as \"sad.\"\n\nThe 55-year-old star explained: \"They're rebooting everything. I don't know how that works with 'Friends,' though. That was about people in their twenties, thirties. The show isn't about people in their forties, fifties. And if we have the same problems, that's just sad.\"\n\nAnd David, 51, has similarly echoed that sentiment in the past that claimed the cast is just too old to play the same characters.\n\nThe actor - who had the part of Ross Gellar in the sitcom - previously said: \"Look, the thing is, I just don't know if I want to see all of us with crutches [and] walkers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I doubt it \u2014 I really doubt it.
