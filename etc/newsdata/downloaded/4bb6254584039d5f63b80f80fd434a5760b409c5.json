I mean, when I was a little kid, some of my first memories are waking up and going, \u201cUgh, I\u2019m gonna die\u201d\u2026\n\nViggo as Aragorn, future King of Gondor (Picture: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nMORE: Very dedicated Hobbit fans recreated the Battle Of Five Armies\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I still think about death when I wake up. It\u2019s the first thing that enters my mind. But I think that\u2019s what makes me want to try things, you know? Whether it\u2019s writing or painting or whatever. To record what\u2019s happening as it goes. It goes quick.\u2019\n\nViggo, who first appeared in Harrison Ford\u2019s 1985 movie Witness, added that growing up in a rural area outside of New York could have been the cause of what he calls a life-long \u2018obsession\u2019.\n\nMr Mortensen in 2005 movie A History Of Violence (Picture: New Line/Everett/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\u2018I guess living in the countryside, I might\u2019ve learned about it earlier. That idea of mortality, you know?\u2019 he said. \u2018Once I realized that animals are gonna die, hence I\u2019m going to die\u2026\u2019\n\nHis LOTR alter-ego Aragorn was haunted by his own death too, being a mortal man in love with the immortal elf Arwen.\n\nIn real life, Viggo\u2019s partner is human Ariadna Gil, and he says he moved to Madrid \u2018because [he] fell in love and she lived there\u2019. Be still out beating hearts.\n\nViggo is somewhat of a recluse compared to most Hollywood actors, after taking a break from movies to focus on his publishing company Perceval Press.\n\nBut he is returning to the silver screen with a new movie called Captain Fantastic that debuted at Cannes, about a man who chooses to raise six his kids away from society.\n\nHe gets totally naked in the movie, something he\u2019s clearly not reluctant to do in front of cameras. At least that\u2019ll temporarily distract his admirers from their own thoughts about death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Viggo Mortensen aka Aragorn from Lord of the Rings hates Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho \u2013 who knew?\n\nMORE: Treebeard from The Lord Of The Rings is living in a Bulgarian forest", "description": "Reclusive actor who now stars in movie Captain Fantastic says it's the first thing he thinks of when he wakes and has been for decades.", "authors": ["Olivia Waring"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/pjimage26.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2016-06-05"}
