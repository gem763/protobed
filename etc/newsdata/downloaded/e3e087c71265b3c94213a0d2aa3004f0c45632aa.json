The person who posted it wrote that her aunt, who\u2019s married to her mother\u2019s brother, had been in a secret relationship with her father for 20 years.\n\nThe infidelity came to light when the Reddit user\u2019s cousin, i.e. the aunt\u2019s daughter, opened the aunt\u2019s Facebook page and the damning messages automatically popped up.\n\nREAD MORE: 'My dad is cheating on my mom and I am tired of keeping his secret'\n\n\u201cShe immediately called me (I honestly thought she was joking as it was so unbelievable). I told her to take as many photos of the conversation as she could . . .\n\n\u201cThen she impulsively called my aunt to confront her and the aunt had the audacity to immediately delete the entire thing as they were talking, while explaining that is was just a joke,\u201d the Reddit post continues.\n\nThe Reddit user decided to give her aunt a week to confess \u2013 something she didn\u2019t believe the aunt would do. She threatened to call for a family meeting to spill the beans if the aunt didn\u2019t confess.\n\n\u201cThe fact that my father is capable of this did not surprise me, but I know it was heart-breaking for my cousins as they\u2019re close with their mum (and I am as well) and I cannot even imagine how my mum would react,\u201d she added.\n\nREAD MORE: My boyfriend says he wants to marry his ex-girlfriend, but I'm not interested in polygamy- what should I do?\n\nThe writer revealed that her mother and father had been together for 18 years and her biggest fear was how letting this secret out would destroy her mother. That\u2019s why she reached out to netizens for advice.\n\n\u201cYour mom absolutely needs to know, do NOT fall for the age-old \u2018I need to hide this to protect her\u2019 fallacy. It will hurt her, but she deserves the truth,\u201d one Redditor wrote.\n\n\u201cYou need to tell your mom before your aunt tells your uncle. Your uncle might tell your dad, who would be able to cover his tracks. Tell her so she can plan. Tell her you support her,\u201d another added.\n\nSources: Reddit, Mirror", "description": "The aunt tried to deny the allegations but the youngster had already taken screenshots of their Facebook conversations and printed them out as evidence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9510/45a2576dcc6e44a8b67ad7b929d405ba.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
