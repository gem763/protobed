But the ease of idling in a vehicle while waiting for your order is now associated with another development: climate change.\n\nAs a result, some communities across the U.S. are banning drive-thrus, citing the additional carbon emissions that are released. Minneapolis this summer banned construction of new drive-thrus, while officials in Long Beach, California, have imposed a six-month ban on new drive-thrus while they study the issue. Similar ordinances restricting or prohibiting fast-food windows have also been adopted in communities including Creve Coeur, Missouri; Fair Haven, New Jersey; and Orchard Park, New York.\n\nMinneapolis cited air pollution from idling vehicles as a major factor for the ban on drive-thrus, along with litter, noise and the potential of vehicles blocking sidewalks, which can increase the risk of a pedestrian accident. The order is part of the city's long-term plan, called Minneapolis 2040, which includes a goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050.\n\nOrchard Park, New York, a town of roughly 30,000 people just south of Buffalo, last month banned new drive-thrus in one part of town, citing traffic concerns. That reportedly prompted threats of a lawsuit by a local businessman who was interested in building a Tim Horton's restaurant in the area.\n\nSome cities also want to change how drive-thrus are used. Portland, Oregon, last year began requiring businesses with drive-thru windows to serve customers who arrive on foot or bicycle if other entrances are closed or inaccessible.\n\nFastest and slowest fast-food drive-thrus\n\nMost of the bans are intended to curtail emissions, cut down on litter and make it easier to walk around business areas, while some towns are motivated by a desire to improve the aesthetics of a community. At other times, such bans have been touted as a means of fighting obesity by discouraging fast-food consumption.\n\nThere's conflicting research on whether banning drive-thru windows improves health, however. In an analysis published last year of drive-thru bans in 27 Canadian cities, researchers noted \"health promotion and chronic disease prevention\" as among the public health benefits.\n\nYet research published in the journal \"Social Science & Medicine\" found obesity rates climbed following a 2008 regulation banning opening or expanding stand-alone fast-food restaurants and drive-thru windows in south Los Angeles.", "description": "Citing climate change, a growing number of communities around the U.S. are banning drive-thru windows", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2008/05/29/564d3739-a642-11e2-a3f0-029118418759/thumbnail/1200x630/a64f79129b9ce76d2e6483224706b4f9/image4136812.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
