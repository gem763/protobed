And then mess up selling them.\n\nViewers who remembered making them as kids (filling lolly-shaped moulds with juice then putting them in the freezer) and thought the task was easy had forgotten one thing: this was The Apprentice.\n\nEven then it seemed difficult to see how anyone could spoil an ice-lolly (surely one of life\u2019s most perfect foods) or imagine a flavor you didn\u2019t like.\n\nUnimpressed: The Apprentice was basically a lesson in how to ruin an ice-lolly. And then mess up selling them\n\nPersonally, the appeal of Mini Milk ice-lollies was always hard to understand \u2013 certainly compared to Fab, Rocket, Calippo, Solero, Fruit Split, even a Twister.\n\nThe Apprentice soon changed that.\n\n\u2018What goes with cherry Cola?\u2019 the girls\u2019 Project Manager asked her colleagues as they sampled ingredients at \u2018a high-end ice-lolly company in West London. (Where else?)\n\n\u2018What about cream cheese?\u2019 wondered Lubna, possibly the last thing I (and hopefully you) would have said.\n\nEventually they settled on a theme of \u2018retro sweet\u2019 ice-lollies - made of cherry Cola and glace cherries with \u2018pieces of liquorice Allsorts in them.\u2019\n\nThis was so retro some of the gals didn\u2019t actually know what liquorice was.\n\nOoer: The boys' phallic lollies made the girls' cherry Cola and liquorice flavour appealing\n\n\u2018But would kids like it?\u2019 fretted Jemelin, correctly sensing the answer was No. Definitely not.\n\nNonetheless this was their ice-lolly to sell to the public. For the corporate client, their \u2018gourmet\u2019 product consisted of \u2018edible flowers and grapes with sprigs of rosemary.\u2019\n\n(Again, yuck.)\n\nAlmost impressively, they managed to make these taste even more unappetizing than they sounded.\n\n\u2018I tried one,\u2019 Karren Brady testified, pulling an unpleasant face. \u2018And had a big lump of rosemary in my mouth. It was like eating a garden!\u2019\n\nQuite.\n\nAs for the boys, for reasons of their own, the flavor of their prototype lolly was \u2018blueberry and activated charcoal.\u2019\n\nUnpleasant: Lord Sugar derided the boys' effort as \u2018looking like a pig\u2019s trotter\u2019, \u2018like a bit of medical waste\u2019, and \u2018as if Ann Summers has gone into the ice-cream business\n\nUnappetising: The girls settled on a theme of \u2018retro sweet\u2019 ice-lollies - made of cherry Cola and glace cherries with pieces of liquorice Allsorts in them\n\nThey sensibly rejected this, opting instead for \u2018blueberries, stem ginger, lavender, and beetroot\u2019 \u2013 which was worse. (Give me charcoal any day \u2013 activated or otherwise.)\n\nThe actual taste of their \u2018deluxe\u2019 ice-lolly (raspberry, coconut milk, and edible glitter) didn\u2019t come into it.\n\nLord Sugar derided it as \u2018looking like a pig\u2019s trotter\u2019, \u2018like a bit of medical waste\u2019, and \u2018as if Ann Summers has gone into the ice-cream business.\u2019\n\nOr as Ryan-Mark Parsons lamented, more succinctly: \u2018the lolly looks like a penis!\u2019\n\nThe buyer from their corporate client certainly thought so.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just going to leave it there\u2026\u2019 she said, putting it back on the table, having suddenly realized she really didn\u2019t want to be on primetime television sucking something pink and phallic.\n\nUnfortunately, the glitter (that the boys assumed would provide the \u2018glamour\u2019 to justify their intended price of \u00a33.85) had \u2018disappeared\u2019 in the coconut milk, sadly denying us the chance of seeing an ice-lolly resembling a glittery penis.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t deal with glitter!\u2019 Project Manager Kenna Ngoma protested, which seemed reasonable but avoided a more pertinent detail: his job.\n\n\u2018I specialize in alcohol-infused ice-cream so this is what I do on a daily basis,\u2019 he\u2019d told the boys, adding perhaps unwisely: \u2018for me this is quite easy!\u2019\n\nKenna becoming Team Leader was clearly \u2018a no-brainer\u2019 \u2013 \u2018being in the industry\u2019 and, as he said, \u2018having an understanding from an ice cream and lolly perspective.\u2019\n\nIt seemed surprising that for \u2018the trend which would be easier to sell\u2019, he chose \u2018the healthy option\u2019 \u2013 considering he was \u2018in the industry\u2019, not to mention his understanding \u2018from an ice cream and lolly perspective.\u2019\n\n\u2018What goes with cherry Cola?\u2019 the girls\u2019 Project Manager asked her colleagues as they sampled ingredients at \u2018a high-end ice-lolly company in West London\n\nLess surprisingly, the candidates didn\u2019t fare much better selling these abominations, particularly to their corporate customers.\n\nThe girls\u2019 team for example kept leaving the room during their meeting (to discuss what price to push for) but then couldn\u2019t actually calculate the total anyway when they returned.\n\n\u2018So you were a bit like Theresa May with Brexit! You went off and came back in with the same deal!\u2019 scoffed Lord Sugar.\n\nSports agent Dean Ahmad also got in a muddle attempting to negotiate a deal for the boys\u2019 upmarket product.\n\n\u2018So you\u2019re doubling the quantity and the price has gone up?\u2019 the client scoffed in disbelief.\n\nWhen the buyer saw the finished article, inevitably she concluded the sex lollies were \u2018not premium\u2019, which was rather an understatement (putting it politely). She then said she could only pay \u00a31 - per item, not for the entire batch (90).\n\n\u2018\u00a33.50!\u2019 Dean countered which, naturally, she rejected.\n\n\u2018Absolutely no way\u2026\u2019 she smiled.\n\nIn hot water: Sports agent Dean Ahmad also got in a muddle attempting to negotiate a deal for the boys\u2019 upmarket product\n\n\u2018What about halfway? \u00a31.25?\u2019\n\n\u2018Absolutely no way\u2026\u2019 she insisted, no longer smiling and repeating her offer of a pound, which, amazingly, he also rejected, inexplicably saying \u2018brilliant, thank you!\u2019, shaking hands, and promptly leaving.\n\nLord Sugar had compared the candidates\u2019 efforts to Brexit. If the task was a metaphor for Britain\u2019s entrepreneurs and the country\u2019s prospects in a post-EU economy, the results did not bode well.\n\nThe girls\u2019 profit of \u00a3545.20p, compared to \u00a3371.43p, gave them a win by \u00a3174.\n\nIt also meant they had each made just \u00a334 per day for their endeavours and the boys only \u00a326.\n\n\u2018This task was a disaster!\u2019 Lord Sugar lambasted them. \u2018I have never in the whole of the time I\u2019ve been in this boardroom come across a situation where a customer who\u2019s disappointed, says \u2018I\u2019ll give you this amount of money\u2019 and you walk away!\u2019\n\nIt was the second week in succession that Dean had been blamed by the boys\u2019 Project Manager for the team losing the task.\n\n'It is unforgiveable that you lost the potential of \u00a3300 worth profit,\u2019 Sugar told Dean, the hapless sub-team leader and corporate negotiator who had snubbed an offer of \u00a31 per sex lolly that was frankly generous.\n\n\u2018It is unforgiveable. Unforgiveable!\u2019\n\nBut, even more unforgivably, it obviously wasn\u2019t.\n\nIn time-honoured style on The Apprentice, at the last second, the boss switched tack.\u2018Kenna, you screwed it up!\u2019 Lord Sugar snarled, and fired him instead.", "description": "The Apprentice was basically a lesson in how to ruin an ice-lolly.
