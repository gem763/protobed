Another $10 billion would be allocated for those with past criminal convictions or who live in areas disproportionately affected by the war on drugs.\n\nOrton said the most important aspect of the plan is to \u201cundo the vicious consequences of the war on drugs.\u201d The policy director lamented that the drug has long been used to target people of color and disqualify the poor from getting access to public benefits.\n\n\u201cCops have been using marijuana \u2014 the smell of marijuana \u2014 as a legal pretext for stops and to bring people into the criminal al justice system that should never be there in the first place,\u201d he told Hill.TV. \u201cBernie\u2019s focus has been to make sure we address the racial justice issue and undo the harm that the war on drugs as related to marijuana, especially, has wrought.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tess Bonn", "description": "A national policy director for Sen.
