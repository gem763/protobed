It said troops opened fire on Sunday on three vessels where the group was being held in Rathedaung township, sinking two and damaging one.\n\n\"Many were killed as there was no cover from incoming fire,\" the rebel group said in a statement.\n\nThere was no independent account of casualties.\n\nLocal member of parliament Khin Saw Wai told Reuters fighting in Rathedaung had been too intense to go there on Sunday and many people had fled for neighbouring villagers after jet fighters flew overhead.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been displaced across Rakhine state since clashes began in December, bringing fresh chaos to a region from which more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a military crackdown in 2017.\n\nThe Rohingya situation is not directly linked to the Arakan Army's fight to win greater autonomy for what was for centuries an independent kingdom.\n\nThe rebels draw on deep-seated historical resentment felt by some in Rakhine toward the ethnic Bamar majority that dominates the central government, and their sense that Myanmar\u2019s faltering transition to democracy has not brought enough benefits.\n\nSunday's abduction was the second in recent weeks by the rebel group, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist local majority.\n\nSuspected rebels disguised as sports players had boarded a bus in the state this month and took hostage dozens of firefighters and civilians.
