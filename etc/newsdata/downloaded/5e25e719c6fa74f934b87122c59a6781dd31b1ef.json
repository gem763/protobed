Another day of industrial action is planned for 27 September.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

BA is obliged to offer the opportunity to rebook on its own flights, or to travel with another day, or provide a full refund.\n\nEuropean air passengers\u2019 rights rules require \u201creimbursement within seven days \u2026 of the full cost of the ticket at the price at which it was bought\u201d.\n\nBut one of the flaws in the way the regulations were drafted is that they do not provide certainty for passengers who book through travel agents.\n\nOn direct bookings, British Airways is providing full refunds on request. But travellers who have booked through a travel agent are subject to that company\u2019s terms and conditions \u2013 which may mean they incur an administration fee.\n\nOne passenger, Ann Marie McDaid, had booked a Glasgow-London-Florida trip for six people on 27 September through a Berkshire-based agent TravelUp. When their outbound flights were cancelled they chose a refund, but almost \u00a3300 was deducted from the amount they paid.\n\nAfter The Independent intervened, TravelUp investigated and found that a mistake had been made. The agent has removed the administration fee completely as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nBut the company is maintaining a fee of \u00a350 per booking, not per person, for British Airways customers.\n\nTravelUp, in common with other travel agents, has had to devote significant resources to handling disruption arising from the BA pilots\u2019 strike.\n\nIt is telling passengers that they can expect a refund in up to eight weeks, depending on how long British Airways takes to release the money to the agent.\n\nMeanwhile a sixth day of industrial action is taking place at Ryanair.\n\nPilots employed by the airline in the UK are striking over a range of grievances including pension provisions and maternity benefits.\n\nNo flights have been affected, and Ryanair says it expects to run a full schedule on Thursday 19 and Saturday 21 September.\n\nThe pilots are also walking out on 23, 25, 27 and 29 September.", "description": "Passengers whose flights have been cancelled by the British Airways pilots\u2019 strike, and who choose to take a refund, may not get all their money back if they booked via a travel agent.
