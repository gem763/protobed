There is, for instance, her position on vaccines, which she had to repeatedly clarify after calling mandatory vaccinations \u201cdraconian\u201d and \u201cOrwellian\u201d at an event in New Hampshire. Or her attacks on antidepressants, which she says are overprescribed and has suggested were to blame for some celebrities\u2019 suicides. Williamson has claimed she\u2019s being subjected to unfair scrutiny \u2014 for example, when she was ridiculed for appearing to suggest on Twitter that prayer and \u201cthe power of the mind\u201d could change the path of Hurricane Dorian, she retorted that her view is \u201cneither bizarre nor unintelligent.\u201d\n\nBut even though many Democrats do believe that a higher power or spiritual force has acted in their lives in some way \u2014 whether to protect, reward, or punish them \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean they have an appetite for talk of supernatural intervention from someone seeking a great deal of earthly power. Williamson has made it farther in this year\u2019s race than some more seasoned politicians, and she could theoretically end up in the October debate, but she\u2019s still a long-shot. At this point, though, it\u2019s hard to imagine what would cause voters to take Williamson seriously as a presidential candidate \u2014 even if there is something potent about her mystical political pitch and her belief that to solve the country\u2019s problems, we need more than a set of policy plans.", "description": "", "authors": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features Why-Marianne-Williamsons-Brand-Of-Spirituality-Isnt-Working"], "top_image": ""}
