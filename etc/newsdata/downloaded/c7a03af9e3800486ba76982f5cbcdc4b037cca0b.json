How could Frese have been so careless as to draw attention to his own leaks by retweeting the articles that contained material he had accessed? Why would he have gone out of his way to access information not related to his assignment for other leaks, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs that even an Inspector Clouseau could follow?\n\nWashington Post media critic Eric Wemple has even better questions for the two NBC News reporters who ran Frese as their source. Hasn\u2019t anyone taught them source-protection methods? Especially these days, when this administration and the previous one both targeted leaks?\n\nIn this case, the communications presented law-enforcement authorities with a hanging curveball. For instance, the affidavit declares that Macias followed Frese on Twitter and Frese followed Macias on Twitter. \u201cSearch warrant returns from Twitter show that, seven days after FRESE accessed Intelligence Report 1 for the second time, Journalist 1 wrote a Twitter Direct Message (\u201cDM\u201d) to FRESE in which she asked whether FRESE would be willing to speak with Journalist 2.\u201d \u2026 It gets worse, though: The affidavit states that via \u201copen source records\u201d search, the authorities were able to determine that Frese followed Macias on Twitter and Macias followed Frese on Twitter. That makes sense, especially when considering this additional fact: \u201cPublic records checks also show that FRESE and Journalist 1 had the same residential address from August 2017 through August 2018. Based on reviews of FRESE\u2019s and Journalist 1\u2019s public social media pages, it appears that they were involved in a romantic relationship for some or all of that period of time.\u201d\n\nWemple then expands on that point, but let\u2019s stick with the source-protection issue first. This came up in the Reality Winner case too, whose cover got blown by The Intercept when they decided to publish the images of documents supplied by her to them. Unbeknownst to any of them, intel agencies have systems that leave identifying marks on printed materials, and the images published by The Intercept pointed investigators right to Winner. The Intercept came under criticism at the time for their amateurish bungling that exposed their source.\n\nWhat about NBC, which has been in this business a lot longer than The Intercept? Not only did Frese, Macias, and Kube all follow each other on social media under their real names, Macias and Frese lived together while she published stories on her byline with classified information Frese supplied. Frese may have been an idiot, but did it never occur to the reporters involved that perhaps a degree or two of distance would be required to protect their source within the DIA?\n\nNot to mention the ethical issues that sleeping with a source presents, even outside of classified material or source protection. Wemple has a word or two to say about that as well:\n\nInstant conflict of interest. No journalist can report objectively on the defense establishment if he or she is involved romantically with a key source employed therein.\n\nThat argument applies specifically to Macias, we should note, and not Kube. The reasons for Wemple\u2019s argument should be obvious, but apparently aren\u2019t. That more than the bungling of the source might be why Macias has been reportedly suspended by NBC News through CNBC, and why Kube has apparently not been suspended.\n\nWemple\u2019s interest in criticizing the pair for their handling of a source is almost as obvious. The intent of the DoJ\u2019s prosecution of Frese and other leakers is to make clear the disincentives of talking with reporters, which means the latter will eventually get much less access to information. Careless and irresponsible reporters like Macias and by extension Kube will eventually erode confidence of sources in media organizations\u2019 ability to protect their identities and make it even tougher for media outlets to get access to such information.\n\nOf course, the sources themselves could help themselves by not moving in with the reporters and retweeting them, so perhaps the risk is limited. However, Wemple\u2019s not wrong to think that the amateurish handling of Winner, James Wolfe, and now Frese might \u2014 and should \u2014 have cleared personnel thinking twice about violating the law to spill classified information to reporters.", "description": "Also: \"Instant conflict of interest.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/facepalm-newspaper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
