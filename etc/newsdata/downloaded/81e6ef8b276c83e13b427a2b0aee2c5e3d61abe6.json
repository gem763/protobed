REUTERS/Naseem Zeitoun/File Photo\n\nNasser Al Khater, chief executive of the 2022 World Cup, also promised that fans from Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt, countries currently boycotting the Gulf state, would not be barred. The four have accused Qatar of supporting terrorism, which it denies.\n\nQatar was the surprise winner of the race to hold the tournament in a vote in 2010 and is by far the smallest country in size ever to have hosted the event, raising questions as to how it will manage the influx of fans and whether supporters will be able to let their hair down.\n\n\u201cQatar is a conservative country, it\u2019s a modest country, alcohol is not part of our culture however hospitality is,\u201d Al Khater told a group of reporters.\n\n\u201cFor the World Cup, we want to make sure (alcohol) is accessible for fans that travel from abroad that want to have a drink while they are here, so we want to find designated locations for fans to have alcohol other than the traditional places.\u201d\n\nUntil now, FIFA and local organisers have said only that they had not reached an agreement on whether alcohol would be served in stadiums or fan zones.\n\nAl Khater said the country of 2.7 million would also consider lowering the price \u2014 currently around $15 for a half litre of beer.\n\n\u201cThe issue of the cost of alcohol is something that is being discussed right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recognise there is an issue with price.\u201d\n\nAlcohol in Qatar can only be bought and consumed in a handful of hotels while visitors cannot import it into the country. Being drunk in a public place is socially unacceptable.\n\nIn January, Qatar added a 100 percent alcohol tax that increased prices but then lowered them around 20 to 30 percent.\n\nALL-DAY DRINKINGAsked how Qataris might react to all-day drinking and rowdy behaviour by visiting fans, Al Khater said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it risks alienating Qataris as long as the right formula is found.\u201dHe added that security forces needed to find a \u201cdelicate way\u201d to cope with anti-social behaviour.\n\nThey would be trained to \u201cmake sure that things which are culturally different are seen in the (context) that what might be acceptable to an England fan might not be acceptable here, to make sure we bridge that gap,\u201d he said.\n\nAl Khater said homosexuals had nothing to fear in a country where homosexual acts are strictly prohibited, although the law is rarely enforced.\n\n\u201cPublic displays of affection are frowned upon here but that applies to everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to assure any fan of any gender orientation, religion or race to rest assured that Qatar is one of the safest countries in the world and that they will all be welcomed here.\u201d\n\nAlthough he did not see a high risk of hooliganism, Al Khater said having the fans of all 32 teams in a small area could lead to altercations, adding that Qatar was looking at \u201cunique accommodation solutions\u201d including cruise ships and fan villages in the desert.\n\nQatar still views the tournament as a \u201cWorld Cup for this region\u201d despite the blockade which has made travel to the country more difficult and pushed air fares up.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The tournament's official logo for the 2022 Qatar World Cup is seen on a building at Souq Waqif in Doha, Qatar, September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Ibraheem al Omari/File Photo\n\nOf the four countries boycotting Qatar, the teams of Saudi Arabia and Egypt are the most likely to qualify.\n\n\u201cWe have no issues welcoming fans from blockading countries, they are welcome to come now and they will be welcome to come in 2022,\u201d Al Khater said. \u201cI hope by then that situation would have been resolved.\u201d", "description": "Qatar wants to make alcohol accessible for visiting fans when it hosts the 2022 World Cup and will use cruise ships to ensure it can accommodate an expected one million visitors, the head of the organising committee told reporters on Thursday.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434316175&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P24F", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
