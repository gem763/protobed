According to US media, however, analysts say it is unclear if a protocol will be in place in time for executions to take place by the end of the year. Analysts also expect opposition to any protocol put in place.\n\nThe inmates included on the initial list of scheduled executions include, Daniel Lewis Lee, a white supremacist who was convicted in Arkansas for murdering a family of three, including an 8-year-old girl.\n\nAnother is Lezmond Mitchell, who was found guilty by a jury in Arizona of stabbing a 63-year-old grandmother and forcing her young granddaughter to sit next to her lifeless body on a car journey before slitting the girl's throat.\n\nFirst date\n\nThe other three inmates who will be executed are Wesley Ira Purkey, who raped and murdered a teenaged girl, Alfred Bourgeois, who sexually molested and killed his young daughter, and Dustin Lee Honken, who shot and killed five people.\n\nLee will be the first one to be executed, with the date set for December 9, 2019.\n\n\"Each of these inmates has exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies,\" the department said, adding that all five executions will take place at the US Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\nOnline, rights groups, some Democrats and activists called the move \"wrong\".\n\n\"The decision by this administration to resume the federal death penalty after a nearly two-decade hiatus is wrong,\" Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said in a statement.\n\nKamala Harris, a senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted that \"capital punishment is immoral and deeply flawed\".\n\n\"We need a national moratorium on the death penalty, not a resurrection,\" she added.\n\nDemocratic Representative Barbara Lee on Twitter called the death penalty \"a racist and error-prone practice that doesn't deter crime\".\n\nAbout 43.6% of the current death row inmates are white, the Death Penalty Information Center found.\n\nNearly 42% are black, despite African Americans making up only 13.4% of the US population.\n\n\n\n\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
