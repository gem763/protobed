We just want to live.\n\n\"Turkey is the country that welcomed us, that is teaching our children in their schools. I have to respect the country.\"\n\nHe also refused to discuss the SDF.\n\n\"I can't speak out against them, I still have family there,\" he said, although he did concede that had he remained in Qamishli, where he moved to after Malikiyya, he would have been forcibly conscripted to the SDF.\n\nTwo streets away, 57-year-old Jaweeda al-Hamoud sat in the courtyard of her house, dressed in all-black.\n\nThe same explosions that killed Muhamed also killed Hamoud's youngest child and only son that lived with her, 18-year-old Dara Ali.\n\n\"I've worked hard well into my age cleaning houses just to provide for my son,\" she cried. \"Now he's gone.\"\n\nHamood holds a picture of her son Dara Ali, 18, who was killed in the October 11 attack in Nusaybin [Hosam Salem/Al Jazeera]\n\nOriginally from Qamishli, she fled to Nusaybin in 2013. She does not want to return to Syria.\n\n\"I want to stay near my son's grave,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked who she blames for her son's death, she starts shaking her head.\n\n\"I can't say anything,\" she said. \"I can't do anything. I hope everyone can resolve their issues so the war can end. We've suffered for so long.\"\n\nNusaybin currently hosts 350 Syrian-Kurdish refugee families and remains heavily patrolled by Turkish security forces.\n\n191019201953868\n\nThis is due to one outcome by the 2015-2016 campaign by Turkish forces against Kurdish armed groups, specifically the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara considers a terrorist group, in the southeast of the country.\n\nThe military confrontation started after a bombing in Suruc, allegedly perpetrated by ISIL, killed 34 people, mostly Kurds.\n\nThe PKK blamed Ankara for the attack, saying it has \"supported and cultivated\" ISIL against the Kurds. The Turkey-PKK 2013 ceasefire, called for by the PKK's jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan, quickly deteriorated.\n\nThe site of the mortar and shelling attack by the YPG group in Nusaybin, Mardin [Hosam Salem/Al Jazeera]\n\n'Tragedy' of Syrian-Kurds\n\nThe reluctance to speak about the military operation, either in support of or against, is part of what Rosa Burc, a PhD researcher at the Center on Social Movement Studies in Florence, Italy, calls \"a tragedy\" of the Syrian-Kurdish people.\n\n\"To criticise the Turkish operation would mean risking their status as refugees and their lives as well as facing possible arrests,\" Burc said.\n\n\"It is not an easy situation for these refugees in Turkey right now who are from a region that Turkey has declared is a terrorist corridor and the number one enemy of the state.\"\n\nBurc said that despite Turkey giving refuge to Kurds fleeing the Syrian war, the fact that Ankara has launched a military offensive in Kurdish-populated areas in Syria shows the extent to which Kurds are truly \"stateless\".\n\n\"Not in a nation-state way, but in a way that none of these countries inhabit [Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey] provide fundamental human rights and protection to Kurdish people.\"\n\nBurc says that after the 2015-2016 conflict between Turkish forces and the PKK, the southeast region has been \"precarious in terms of security and safety, but more so even in the restrictedness of freedom of movement, freedom of speech, freedom of public gathering and protesting\".\n\n\"The entire region has been even more securitised after the military operations in 2015-16 which creates a very difficult situation for civilians living in the area,\" she said.\n\nFor Abu Ahmad, people should be tried for the crimes they commit and not according to their ethnicity.\n\n\"We are all Syrians, and we want the war to end,\" he said. \"We fled the war only to lose Muhamed here.
