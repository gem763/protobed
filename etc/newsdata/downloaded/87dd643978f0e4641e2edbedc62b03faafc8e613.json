But then he had to go and spoil it all with a letter attacking his successor Geordie Greig\n\nTo the executive offices of Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, and a story that you sense will end with a screenwriter floating dead in a swimming pool. For while a certain faded newspaper executive\u2019s office is physically located in the Associated building on London\u2019s High Street Kensington, I\u2019m afraid that, in spiritual terms, this individual resides on Sunset Boulevard. And some shots have been fired.\n\nBut who is this descending the staircase, wild-eyed and writing excruciatingly humiliating letters to the Financial Times? Why, I believe \u2013 yes, it looks like Paul Dacre, forgotten star of the silent newspaper era. You know, before everyone pivoted to video. Then pivoted back again, having made somewhat less of a success of it than Hollywood did with the talkies.\n\nAnyway, let us bring up the lights and hear what the former Daily Mail editor is saying as he emotes furiously down the stairs of his dreamworld: \u201cYou see, this is my life! It always will be! Just us, the printing presses, and all those wonderful readers out there in the dark. All right, Lord Rothermere \u2013 I\u2019m ready for my closeup.\u201d Wonderful. Tragic, camp, hilarious \u2013 of course. But wonderful. Legends don\u2019t die; they just stew in the C-suite.\n\nBut forgive me, for I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Let\u2019s widen our shot from the corpse \u2013 perhaps my own, after writing this \u2013 and go back in time a bit. Last Saturday\u2019s Financial Times featured a letter written to the paper by Dacre, and it was impossible to behold this document for even a moment without the words reassembling themselves into Norma Desmond\u2019s famous speech. The missive was prompted by the paper\u2019s interview with the current Mail editor, Geordie Greig, who, over the course of a lunch, chanced to mention that 265 advertisers who had deserted the Mail under Dacre have returned to the fold since his successor assumed the editorship. Alas, the suggestion that he was commercially dislikable \u2013 the only kind of dislike that matters \u2013 was rather too much for our silent star.\n\nAnd so to the letter. \u201cAdmirable chap he may be,\u201d runs Dacre\u2019s first blatant euphemism for his favourite four-letter word, \u201cbut Geordie Greig is as economic with the actualit\u00e9 as your paper is in reporting Brexit.\u201d Oooooh! Since digressions seem to be permitted, I do hope that, even in seclusion, Dacre is still attended by one faithful retainer/damaged former news editor, who forges daily fan mail to him and assures him: \u201cMadame is the greatest star of all.\u201d\n\nPaul Dacre's position at Mail in doubt after attack on Geordie Greig Read more\n\nAnyway, back to madame. \u201cHe claims 265 advertisers came back to the Daily Mail in his year as editor,\u201d she hisses. \u201cIn fact, far more than that number left during the same period.\u201d Don\u2019t you just adore dirty linen \u2013 the only type of washing that isn\u2019t a lady\u2019s job. In similarly relaxed style, Dacre goes on to fret to the FT about \u201cyour writer\u2019s ludicrous caricature of the Mail before I stepped aside\u201d \u2013 before you what, sorry? \u2013 \u201cbefore I stepped aside at 70 after 26 years in the chair\u201d. It\u2019s somewhat disappointing that the FT headlined this letter \u201cA solid start, but Greig has some way to go yet\u201d, when it clearly should have gone for: \u201cI AM big \u2013 it was the papers that got small.\u201d\n\nDacre goes on to list his achievements with the Daily Mail down the years \u2013 billions in profits, increased circulation, successful campaigns and a number of much-loved but dated Cecil B DeMille pictures. No mention of all the unvaccinated kiddies, but perhaps the FT edited him for space, or a late-breaking letter from a sustainable businesswoman.\n\n\u201cAs for Mr Greig,\u201d comes the next clear euphemism for Dacre\u2019s favourite word, \u201cI congratulate him for making a solid start as editor and continuing so many of those campaigns but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll forgive me for suggesting that he (or his PR) defers his next lunch with the FT until he has notched up a small fraction of those journalists\u2019 achievements.\u201d And with that, it is signed: \u201cPaul Dacre, chairman and editor in chief, Associated Newspapers.\u201d\n\nOutspoken Paul Dacre has accidentally flashed a bit of weaknessboob, giving onlookers much more than they bargained for\n\nWell then. No matter how kindly we may wish to look upon former idols, this letter has more than a touch of the messy bitches to it. In fact, as a show of weakness, it is almost too much. To put it in terms I know he would appreciate: the former Mail editor seems to have had some sort of dignity malfunction. Yes, outspoken Paul Dacre has accidentally flashed a bit of weaknessboob there, giving onlookers much more than they bargained for. Stunned newspaper fans \u2013 all five of them \u2013 commented how Dacre seemed not to care who saw as he flaunted his vulnerability in a revealing letter that left nothing to the imagination.\n\nFurthermore, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the end of it. Indeed, it was an exquisite torment to read a follow-up story on Wednesday, headlined: \u201cPaul Dacre\u2019s position at Mail in doubt after attack on Geordie Greig.\u201d In many ways, we don\u2019t need to pay any attention to the article in question, on account of it having appeared in the Guardian, a newspaper neither Dacre nor I would ever dream of having in the house. On the other hand, we have both had one of our secretarial retinue print out a hard copy of the article from the online version of that publication, from which I learn that senior Associated executives have been \u201cinfuriated\u201d by Dacre\u2019s flash of weaknessboob (again I paraphrase). Words such as \u201cunprofessional\u201d are used.\n\nAccording to this report: \u201cThe row has focused attention on Dacre\u2019s actual role at the publisher of the Daily Mail. He signed the letter to the FT using the title of \u2018chairman and editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers\u2019.\u201d And why shouldn\u2019t he? \u201cThe title was regarded by many internally as a way of honouring a long-serving employee rather than an active editorial role.\u201d\n\nOh. Oh dear. That sounds TOO awful. Worse than when Paramount invites Norma Desmond in and she thinks she\u2019s getting a movie, but in fact it just wishes to rent her classic automobile. The report concludes: \u201cThe new twist in the dispute between Dacre and Greig will put pressure on [Mail proprietor] Rothermere to resolve the issue of Dacre\u2019s status. One company insider said the whole point of giving Dacre a title was to keep him in the tent and avoid the possibility of him becoming an external critic. \u2018Clearly,\u2019 they said, \u2018that hasn\u2019t worked.\u2019\u201d\n\nEarly days, early days. Still, if it doesn\u2019t come good for Dacre in the executive suite, he does have other irons in the fire. A couple of months ago, it was announced that Channel 4 had commissioned a landmark series detailing \u201cPaul Dacre\u2019s worldview\u201d. I am, of course, absolutely dying to see this show, which I\u2019m intrigued to understand will be more than a 60-minute looped shot of a Spitfire shooting up a Viagra factory.\n\nSo yes, all very promising, but don\u2019t call the programme a \u201ccomeback\u201d. As Norma warns Joe Gillis: \u201cI hate that word. It\u2019s a return, a return to the millions of people who have NEVER forgiven me for deserting the screen.\u201d Well, quite. I feel absolutely sure that Dacre\u2019s best days are ahead of him, just like the UK\u2019s after the leaving the EU, or a single mother trying to re-enter the job market after having a baby. But if not, this current performance should serve as a delight to all \u2013 a glorious swansong, if you will, from Fleet Street\u2019s finest.", "description": "The former Daily Mail editor had been living in his secluded dreamworld.
