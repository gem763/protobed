Everything you need to know about the new wireless revolution It's a capital improvement project the size of the entire planet, replacing one wireless architecture created this century with another one that aims to lower energy consumption and maintenance costs. Read More\n\nThe two will collaborate to develop autonomous construction robots, among other technologies, that use 5G to improve productivity and monitoring at construction sites.\n\nKT and Hyundai will build 5G networks at the latter's construction sites and commence trials of the 5G solutions on two sites sometime this year, they said.\n\nAfter the proof-of-concept trial, they have plans to apply their technologies to more construction sites.\n\nKT said its enterprise 5G technologies provide \"ultra-fast data transmission speeds and ultra-low latency with top notch security\", touting that the technologies are perfect for transmitting large files such as 3D scanning data of construction sites.\n\nThe companies also said that the development of autonomous robots would allow Hyundai to perform work on sites even in areas where human access is difficult.\n\nKT's partnership with Hyundai follows a string of other projects the telco has worked on to push 5G connectivity in South Korea. Last week, KT announced it was working with Samsung to install 5G networks on the latter's hospitals and co-develop smart hospital solutions while in June, the telco began the rollout of 5G networks at large and crowded buildings such as airports and train stations.\n\nSeparately, the South Korean telco is also collaborating with Hyundai Motor to develop a fleet management solution for electric buses.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nKT and Samsung to apply 5G for 'smart hospital'\n\n5G networks will be installed at Samsung Medical Center's proton therapy center and cancer hospital.\n\nKT rolls out 5G roaming services in Europe\n\n5G subscribers of KT can now continue to stay connected in Italy, Switzerland, and Finland.\n\nKT and Hyundai to collaborate in electric bus management\n\nThe South Korean telco will provide a fleet management system for Hyundai's electric buses.\n\nKT applies battery conserving tech on 5G network\n\nThe application of Connected Mode Discontinuous Reception (CDRX) technology will allow 5G smartphone owners to save battery life.\n\nGlobal 5G users projected to reach 1.5B by 2024 (TechRepublic)\n\nWith 5G technology expected to hit the ground running in 2020, widespread adoption of the service will follow.", "description": "KT and Hyundai Engineering & Construction will collaborate to use 5G networks for automation in construction.", "authors": ["Cho Mu-Hyun"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/25/8f90c93e-ea5c-4934-b2ca-2c236db22755/thumbnail/770x578/1a1eaa8a67a897844eda0160f7c6d170/construction.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
