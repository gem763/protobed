Some politicians and activists have linked Hong Kong\u2019s shadowy network of triad criminal gangs to political intimidation and violence in recent years, sometimes against pro-democracy activists and critics of Beijing.\n\nRiot police marched down the street ordering protesters to disperse on Monday, warning they would fire tear gas. At one stage they rushed protesters and detained one person.\n\nAt one stage scuffles broke out between pro-Beijing supporters and protesters.\n\nHong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam (R) and Commissioner of Police, Lo Wai-chung meet with representatives of the Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong and other leaders of the local Muslim community at the Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, in Hong Kong, China October 21, 2019. Information Services Department/Handout via REUTERS\n\n\u201cINDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, JUSTICE\u201d\n\nYim, a 42-year-old social worker, said he was in Yuen Long station on the night of the attack, adding it was important to continue to protest against such mob violence.\n\n\u201cIf they really wanted to catch those attackers they could,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were many people filmed that night but they\u2019ve only arrested six people so far ... we want an independent investigation and justice for this attack. The police are selectively enforcing the law.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has been battered by more than 5 months of anti-government protests, and despite two weeks of calm, Sunday\u2019s mass rally showed there was no end in sight to the unrest.\n\nEmbattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam has rejected the demands of protesters and backed police using violence against them. Many say police have used excessive force against them, firing thousands of rounds of tear gas and hundreds of rubber bullets against brick- and petrol bomb-throwing activists.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nSince the protests escalated in June, more than 2,600 people have been arrested, many under 18 years of age, while two people have been shot and many more injured.\n\nMany people in Hong Kong are angry at what they see as mainland China\u2019s attempts to limit the freedoms the city enjoys under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle enshrined in its handover from Britain in 1997.\n\nThe protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power. Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to split China.\n\nProtesters are demanding universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, amnesty for those charged, an end to labelling protesters as rioters, and the formal withdrawal of a China extradition bill which ignited the unrest.", "description": "Hundreds of Hong Kong riot police confronted pro-democracy demonstrators on Monday night as they gathered to commemorate the three-month anniversary of an assault by more than 100 men on protesters, commuters and journalists.", "authors": ["Sarah Wu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443362164&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K109", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
