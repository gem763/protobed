Sales prices have now been falling steadily for over a year and are roughly 6% lower than they were at the time of the Brexit referendum in 2016, by Knight Frank\u2019s measure.\n\n\n\nMore: With Possible U.S. Economic Downturn on the Horizon, It Pays to Take Out a Mortgage\n\nHome values in the British countryside look even more attractive when compared to a decade ago. Prices never fully recovered from the global financial crisis, meaning the average prime country home is now trading roughly 20% below its 2008 peak price, according to the index.\n\n\n\nThose discounts appear to be drawing in city-dwellers, who can stretch their budgets across many more square feet when buying outside of the U.K. capital. So far this year, Londoners accounted for more than one in three deals over \u00a32 million (US$2.53 million) in the countryside, the highest that number\u2019s been in eight years, according to Knight Frank.\n\n\n\nInterest in luxury country homes is likely to persist, and help stabilize price declines in some areas, according to Knight Frank\u2014which says the number of house hunters with a budget of \u00a32 million or more has risen 9% compared to last year.\n\nFrom Penta: Monet\u2019s \u2018Charing Cross Bridge\u2019 Could Fetch $30 Million at Sotheby\u2019s\n\nThe only hitch for luxury home buyers at the moment is that some of the best homes may be sitting on the sidelines, as would-be sellers \u201chesitate due to the political uncertainty,\u201d said Oliver Knight, associate at Knight Frank, adding that softness in country home prices will likely persist for the remainder of the year and into 2020.", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-116239?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
