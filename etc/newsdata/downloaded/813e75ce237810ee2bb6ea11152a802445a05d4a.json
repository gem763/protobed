The U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the proposed Obama-era regulation unacceptably exceeded EPA\u2019s statutory authority and disregarded states\u2019 concerns that the rule abandoned federalism, so the CPP never went into effect. Its legal troubles aside, the CPP regulations would have imposed significant costs on American families and businesses all for negligible impact on global temperatures.\n\nRather than having a centralized agency like the EPA force states to re-engineer their energy landscape, ACE focuses on the regulation at the power plant level, rightsizing the EPA\u2019s regulatory role. ACE offers a much needed course correction on an agency that went rogue in promulgating CPP.", "description": "Washington, D.C.\u2014 Heritage Foundation environmental policy expert Nick Loris released the following response to the EPA\u2019s replacement of the Obama administration\u2019s burdensome Clean Power Plan (CPP) with the Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
