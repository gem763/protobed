(Graham Kennedy)\n\nThe gene editing technique CRISPR allows scientists to remove or insert sequences into the genes of living things, potentially curing hereditary diseases, or increasing certain abilities. These changes can be made in a way that they die with the subject, or in a way that is passed down to future generations.\n\nThe technology is in its very early stages, and Baylis is concerned that not enough is known about the risks or long-term effects.\n\nShe acknowledged her theoretical couple is a \"dramatic example.\"\n\nBut she told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch she wants people \"to stop and think about what does it mean to identify a social problem, and then to think that it's reasonable to bring a biological solution to a social problem.\"\n\n\"I would like to think that we would step back and say: 'We have a real social problem, let's fix it,'\" she said.\n\n\"Biology isn't the answer.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
