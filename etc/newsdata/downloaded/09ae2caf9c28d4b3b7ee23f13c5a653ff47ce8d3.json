But She Might Be A Victim Of One.", "language": "en", "text": "When Democratic Rep. Katie Hill won election in 2018, she gained attention for securing a tough district held by a Republican. She also made history as the first openly bisexual congresswoman from California. Now she\u2019s capturing headlines again, only this time for all the wrong reasons.\n\nLast week, RedState, a conservative news website, ran a story accusing Hill of having extramarital affairs with a female campaign staffer and a male congressional aide. The article included a nude photo of Hill with her breasts obscured. On Thursday, The Daily Mail published more sexually explicit photos of Hill, along with breathless details of her romantic relationships. As a result, private photos of her are spreading like a rot online, and there\u2019s little Hill can do to stop it. Intimate, personal snapshots of her life are currently being ogled by anyone with a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nHill has confirmed that she was in a relationship with the campaign worker, though she denies any romantic involvement with her congressional aide. The House Committee on Ethics has begun an investigation, since it is against House rules for representatives to have sexual relationships with congressional staff. (Those rules do not appear to extend to campaign staff.)\n\nMuch of the media coverage surrounding Hill has focused on her sex life; who she did or did not sleep with. The fascination likely stems from the fact that she is LGBTQ and allegedly involved in a polyamorous relationship. But by focusing on her sexuality, an important fact is being lost in translation.\n\nHill is not accused of committing a crime by dating her campaign staffer, but she may be a victim of one. In most states, including California, it is illegal to share sexually explicit photos of a person without his or her consent. That\u2019s commonly called revenge porn \u2015 and in Hill\u2019s home state, that could be punished by up to six months in jail.\n\nIt is unclear how the news outlets acquired the photos of Hill. In a statement released Wednesday, Hill said, \u201cI am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me. I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain.\u201d Hill did not elaborate further or offer evidence linking her estranged husband to the leaked photos. He did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOn Thursday, Hill sent a cease and desist letter to the Daily Mail, demanding the news outlet remove the photos they had published.\n\n\u201cKatie Hill, like many women in marriages that end in separation, endured years of emotional abuse from a now-estranged husband,\u201d her lawyers wrote in the letter, which HuffPost obtained. \u201cBy spreading these purported claims, and dehumanizing and shaming images across the globe, you have perpetuated the cycle of abuse Representative Hill has endured.\u201d\n\nHuffPost reached out to the Daily Mail for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nUnder California\u2019s \u201crevenge porn\u201d statute, it is illegal for a person to intentionally distribute \u201cthe image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person ... under circumstances in which the persons agree or understand that the image shall remain private, the person distributing the image knows or should know that distribution of the image will cause serious emotional distress, and the person depicted suffers that distress.\u201d\n\nRevenge porn may be used as a tactic in abusive relationships to control, blackmail or harm an intimate partner. But contrary to popular belief, images do not have to be shared by a vengeful ex to be considered \u201crevenge porn.\u201d A person who shares nonconsensual pornography for financial gain or for another reason can still be engaging in the practice.\n\n\u201cAnybody who released or published Ms. Hill\u2019s image should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d said Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer specializing in sexual privacy violations and author of \u201cNobody\u2019s Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls.\u201d\n\nShe noted that many state\u2019s \u201crevenge porn laws\u201d have exceptions when the distribution is newsworthy. \u201cThere is nothing newsworthy here,\u201d she said. \u201dMs. Hill is entitled to sexual privacy just like any other public or private figure.\u201d\n\nFemale lawmakers are often attacked for their sexuality \u2015 especially if they are young and attractive like Hill, said Jennifer Piscopo, an assistant professor of politics at Occidental College who has studied gender and politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to undermine their authority, to call into question their ability, and to make them feel intimidated,\u201d she said.\n\nThe more prominent women politicians are, the more likely they are to sustain and receive online abuse, Piscopo added.\n\n\u201cHill was thought to be a rising star in the Democratic Party. Not just because of her gender but also the way she won that close race in California,\u201d she said. \u201cThat makes her more vulnerable to attacks.\u201d\n\nHill has apologized for having a sexual relationship with her campaign worker, saying in a statement that \u201ceven a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate.\u201d But she has pushed back on the idea that her personal life and private photos should be anyone\u2019s business, calling the reports a \u201csmear campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis coordinated effort to try to destroy me and the people close to me is despicable and will not succeed,\u201d she said. \u201cI, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\u201d", "description": "In many states, sharing the freshman representative's nude photos would be illegal under \"revenge porn\" statutes.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db219b42100005f2534afcf.jpeg?cache=z865bs6mb4&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
