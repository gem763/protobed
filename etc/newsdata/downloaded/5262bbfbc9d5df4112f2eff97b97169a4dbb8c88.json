Her parents have challenged the finding, and appealed Thursday to the Justice Ministry for further investigation.\n\nThe case has been the focus of massive attention by Thai media and much commentary on social media. The furor has been fueled by publication of the suspect's online posts boasting of past sexual conquests and broadcast of surveillance video showing him carrying the apparently unconscious victim.\n\nThai media reported that Dear had been interrogated by police investigating the death of Thitima and afterward lodged a complaint with them against the owners of the party house and some guests.\n\nWomen such as Thitima, 25, are called \"pretties,\" a term for models normally hired for events such as auto shows to pose seductively with products they are promoting.\n\nWorking as party entertainers in private homes is a new development in Thai society but appears to draw significant numbers of willing young women and men, said Varaporn Chamsanit, program manager for the group Women's Wellbeing and Gender Justice.\n\n\"This is a profession with a high risk of being victimized by sexual predators or just regular persons who want to have some fun when they get drunk,\" she said.\n\nThe publicity over Thitima's case has opened up an opportunity for people working in the sector to ask for protection through government regulations, Varaporn said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that both men and women were sought for arrest, not just men.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
