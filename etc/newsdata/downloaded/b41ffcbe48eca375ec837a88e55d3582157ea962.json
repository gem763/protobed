But there are genetic and virologic differences which make these three strains three separate viruses that must each be eradicated individually.''\n\nAccording to a report in Arstechnica, ''Polio viruses in general spread via the fecal-oral route, therefore thriving in areas with poor sanitation and low, to no, vaccination. The virus typically affects young children and can cause permanent paralysis and even death in a small number of those infected.''\n\nThis would make it the second strain of polio to be wiped out this decade following the certification of the eradication of type 2 polio in 2015.\n\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization and Chair of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Polio Oversight Board, in a statement, said that ''the achievement of polio eradication will be a milestone for global health. Commitment from partners and countries, coupled with innovation, means of the three wild polio serotypes, only type one remains.\n\n''We remain fully committed to ensuring that all necessary resources are made available to eradicate all poliovirus strains,'' he added.\n\nThe news for South Africa is mixed, however.\n\nA report in UD Express published on Thursday stated that ''according to a release issued by Rotary South Africa, the country during 1988 was certified polio-free, but in August 2019 that certification was withdrawn.\n\n''Although there have been no cases reported, the country is at risk because only 75% of children are being properly immunized,'' the release stated.\n\nProfessor David Salisbury, chair of the independent Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication, speaking about the breakthrough, said that ''this is a significant achievement that should reinvigorate the eradication process and provides motivation for the final step \u2013 the eradication of wild poliovirus type 1. This virus remains in circulation in just two countries: Afghanistan and Pakistan.''\n\nDr Rebecca Martin, Director of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Center for Global Health said that ''as of October 24, 2019, a total of 95 cases of wild polio have been reported.''\n\nAccording to the Scientific American, ''the Taliban had suspended the vaccination campaign early this year in parts of Afghanistan under its control, but last month it reversed itself and allowed polio immunizations to resume in clinics\u2014though not in mosques or door-to-door.\n\n''In neighbouring Pakistan the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan recently made eradication its top priority, with Khan to assume leadership of the campaign starting next month.''\n\n- Compiled by Ethan Van Diemen", "description": "As countries around the world mark World Polio Day, the World Health Organisation has announced that another strain of polio been ''eradicated worldwide''.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9518/cc029aeeb66f406f80ab0c436cefa450.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
