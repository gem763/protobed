In brief remarks, he lambasted the U.K. prime minister for not putting forward a concrete alternative to the Withdrawal Agreement in writing. He also lashed out at the Tories for falsely promising that Brexit would be easy to accomplish, voiced unwavering support for Ireland, and demanded Brexit supporters stop blaming the EU for the mess they have made.\n\n\u201cWe need written proposals and the time is ticking \u2014 so stop speaking,\u201d Bettel implored Johnson at one point. \u201cAct!\u201d\n\nAt another point, in perhaps his sharpest rebuke, Bettel accused Johnson and the Tories of seeking partisan advantage.\n\n\u201cYou cannot hold a future hostage for party political gain,\u201d Bettel said, adding later: \"This Brexit is not my choice, it has been a decision from the [Tory] Party. It was a decision from David Cameron to do it. They decide. They decide.\u201d\n\n\"I deeply regret it but don\u2019t put the blame on us because now they don\u2019t know how to get out of this,\u201d he said then paused dramatically for a moment, a mischievous grin on his face, before adding \u201csituation they put themselves in. It\u2019s not my choice.\"\n\nIt was a remarkable performance on many levels, not least because the dressing down of the British leader for mishandling Brexit came not from one of the EU\u2019s great powers, the president of France or the chancellor of Germany, but from the prime minister of tiny Luxembourg. And it showed not only just how deep anger now runs among the EU27 but also how fiercely united they remain in loyalty to Ireland and the so-called backstop provision to protect the Irish border that Johnson on Monday continued to insist must be removed from the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nThe press conference itself was delayed by protestors who shouted \u201cstop Brexit\u201d and held signs saying declaring \u201cBrexit is just not funny\u201d and \u201cStop this madness.\u201d A sound-system blasted Beethoven's ninth symphony (the EU anthem) as well as the Rolling Stones' \"(I can't get no) Satisfaction.\"\n\nAfter Johnson's no-show, Downing Street officials said they had suggested holding the press conference elsewhere, but that the hosts declined, insisting it take place outside in view of the watching public.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News shortly after the meeting, Johnson explained his decision, saying: \u201cClearly going to be a lot of noise and our points might have been drowned out,\u201d adding that he didn\u2019t think \u201cit would have been fair\u201d on the Luxembourg prime minister if he had taken part in the press conference.\n\nHowever, a Luxembourg official said \"everything was done with good intentions. It\u2019s true that they asked us to change the location, they wanted to hold it inside, but logistically it was impossible, because we would have had space only for five to 10 journalists, even less, it wouldn\u2019t have worked, we don\u2019t have the infrastructure to host all these journalists.\u201d\n\nTo cheers from the crowd, Bettel did not mince his words about what he regards as the source of the Brexit \"mess.\"\n\nThe effect was that Bettel was gifted a media platform to air the EU's grievances, with no comeback from Johnson. And his solo press conference vastly overshadowed the main purpose of Johnson\u2019s visit: a lunch meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who is a former Luxembourg prime minister. The lunch was described by a EU official as \u201ca lively exchange\u201d in an \u201catmosphere that was very friendly\u201d as \u201cthe two can talk straight.\u201d\n\nA U.K. official said Johnson \"had a good meeting\" with Juncker \"where they agreed to intensify talks. We need to start accelerating talks if we\u2019re going to make further progress. This is on the back of positive meeting in Dublin last week [with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar].\"\n\nBettel's evident frustration with what he said is the failure of the U.K. to submit workable proposals to replace the controversial Northern Ireland backstop stands in sharp contrast to Johnson's own stated optimism that there is \u201ca good chance of a deal\u201d but it is \u201cnot necessarily in the bag.\u201d\n\nTo cheers from the crowd, Bettel did not mince his words about what he regards as the source of the Brexit \"mess.\"\n\nHe stressed that the first priority for the EU \u201cis the preservation of the single market\u201d along with a \u201cdeal that protects the Good Friday Agreement and avoids hard border on the Irish island at all costs.\u201d\n\nGesturing at times toward the empty podium next to him, Bettel said that the U.K. has not offered any \"concrete proposals\" to solve the Northern Ireland border problem. \u201cThe only solution that is currently on the table and meets all these criteria is the Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d he said \u2014 referring to the deal struck with Theresa May's government.\n\n\u201cThere are no changes, there are no concrete proposals for the moment on the table and I won't give an agreement to ideas, we need written proposals and the time is ticking. So stop speaking but act if you want that we are able to discuss about different proposals,\u201d he said. Johnson said in his Sky interview that \"papers had been shared\" with EU negotiators in the last two weeks.\n\nThe Luxembourg PM also said he had asked Johnson if he would consider a second referendum to get out of the political impasse in the U.K., but his British counterpart had told him he would not.\n\nBettel also rejected a proposal that the post-Brexit transition period could be extended by one or two years: \u201cThe fact is that our citizens want to have a certainty ... if we say [an extension] is for one year or two years and this time will be needed to find new decisions, this is a nightmare.\u201d\n\nHe was also asked about Johnson's determination to pursue Brexit on October 31, apparently in contravention of a law passed last week forcing him to apply for an extension to Article 50. \"This wouldn't happen in Luxembourg\" was Bettel's response.\n\nHYPOTHETICAL SECOND BREXIT REFERENDUM POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "\u2018Don\u2019t put the blame on us,\u2019 for the Brexit \u2018mess\u2019, says Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Charlie Cooper", "Cristina Gallardo", "Paul Dallison", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1175050970-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
