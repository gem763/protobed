It is VERY concerning that a whistle blower would go to Adam Schiff and report it to him before the DNI and the report was even completed. They went into the committee deposition with the information of the report before it was reported with the DNI. That makes the complaint suspect to outside influence before the National Intelligence agency received it. Why go to Schiff first instead of NIA (if they feared their senior officers wouldn't do anything) if it wasn't politically motivated.", "description": "On Monday's episode of 'The View,' the co-hosts got heated when discussing Felicity Huffman's role in the College Admissions Scandal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rGYGtMgwoM_5nSn8whwGFA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1000581/e62ec075-8b95-4c9e-a413-eebde055daaa/08c05cd0-3042-5254-882c-ae601c051037/data_3_0.jpg?s=dbb7d56c13d08a393efa744ba1189178&c=4d9a05b3f7427a48ce87970f86be4513&a=cbstv&mr=0"}
