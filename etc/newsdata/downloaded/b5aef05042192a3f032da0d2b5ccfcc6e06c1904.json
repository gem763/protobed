Still, the impeachment process will take a lot of energy out of him and \"the trade war and his never ending \u2018playing loose with the facts\u2019 will ultimately catch-up with him\", he also said.\n\n\"The market impact will be heavily negative for technology companies \u2013 the FANGS, but it will also play into our Q4 Outlook: The Killer Dollar as Warren, like Trump strongly advocates a weaker Dollar.\"\n\nMr Jakobsen said he predicts that Mr Biden\u2019s candidacy will \"wither away\" over the next few months and when the momentum of Senator Warren\u2019s rise is more clearly registered by the market, there will most likely be a repricing of technology stocks, and even the dollar.\n\n\"For now the consensus thinks that Biden can beat Trump but Warren can\u2019t. But that consensus ignores the tectonic demographic and political shifts in the US, the fact that the US\u2019 largest generation, unlike every single other Developed Market country outside of Canada, is the Millenenial generation, who are now the deciders if they are motivated to get out and rock the vote next November.\"", "description": "Saxo chief economist Steen Jakobsen is predicting that Elizabeth Warren will be the 46th US president, and that will be bad news for the FANGs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1728%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_12%2C$y_19/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/59262a9de10d1c44991820b72e085e524785b656", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
