It turns out that the \u201cfatbergs\u201d clogging up our city sewers actually consist of just 0.5% fat and 93% wet wipes. Perhaps we should be calling them \u201cwipebergs\u201d.\n\nA short animated film stars Serkis as a talking anus, highlighting the damaging impact of our addiction to wet wipes and calling for the public to \u201cbe a good a**hole\u201d and dispose of them responsibly.\n\nQuick guide What not to flush to avoid contributing to fatbergs Show Hide Campaigns to educate people about how not to feed fatbergs take pains to remind us that toilets and sinks are not \u201cmagic portals\u201d. There is a simple set of rules for the bathroom: stick to flushing the three Ps: pee, poo and (toilet) paper. Everything else \u2013 sanitary towels, nappies, cotton buds, condoms, dental floss, used plasters and whatever else you might think to chuck down the toilet \u2013 should go into the bin. Just because a product says it is flushable doesn\u2019t mean that it is biodegradable. Baby wipes might be a godsend to parents, but not to Victorian-era sewerage systems. Wipes marketed as flushable will probably be able to make their way down your toilet, but will eventually clog up the pipes further along their journey. The kitchen is another area of concern. Water companies are keen to bust the myth that running hot water and pouring washing-up liquid down the sink ahead of fats, oils or grease will stop it building up and blocking the pipes. Their recommendation is to keep a small container, such as an old margarine tub, to hand in your kitchen, into which you can pour oil and fat before safely disposing of it in the bin. Martin Belam\n\n\u201cAll across the news we are seeing people take a stand to look after our planet,\u201d says Serkis. \u201cIt\u2019s only one tiny change we can all make which goes a long way in protecting our oceans.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever feel so passionate to take on the role of a talking asshole.\u201d\n\nLast year the UK used 10.8bn wet wipes, almost a third of which were flushed down toilets.\n\nThe majority of wet wipes sold in the UK contain plastic and are not biodegradable. They combine with household cooking fats and other hygiene products to form huge solid masses, known as fatbergs.\n\nThese can cause sewage systems to overflow, polluting waterways and seas, says City to Sea, a plastic pollution campaigning organisation behind the drive.\n\nEarlier this year a monster fatberg the size of a jumbo jet was discovered beneath Liverpool, and risked flooding the city\u2019s streets with raw sewage. It weighed the same as 13 African elephants.\n\n\n\nSo far, more fatbergs have been discovered in London than anywhere else in the UK. In 2017, a terrifying 250-metre behemoth that was estimated to weigh 130 tonnes was found in Whitechapel. The capital\u2019s crumbling Victorian-style sewers are struggling to cope with our wet wipe addiction and overflow on average once a week, dumping the wipes into the River Thames.\n\n\n\nMounds of wet wipes have built up on the riverbed over the years, changing the shape of London\u2019s beloved waterway. In 2018, Thames 21, a London environmental organisation that cleans up rivers and canals, retrieved 5,453 wet wipes in 116 sq metres of the Thames embankment near Hammersmith. Wet wipes also find their way on to UK beaches, where they have increased by almost 700% over the last decade.\n\nFighting the fatbergs: how cities are waging war on clogged sewers Read more\n\nThey are also a global problem: Belfast, Denver, and Melbourne have all discovered large fatbergs lurking in their sewers. Nor is it just big cities that are affected: sewer workers in the English seaside town of Sidmouth recently found a fatberg that was 210ft (64m) long.\n\n\n\nPart of the reason so many are flushed appears to stem from the fact that many of the companies producing them call their products \u201cflushables\u201d and do not clearly label the packaging with what they\u2019re actually made of.\n\n\u201cThere is a confusion when we are told we can flush them,\u201d says City to Sea founder Natalie Fee. \u201cYes, physically they can pass through a toilet, but the material they are made of doesn\u2019t break down. People don\u2019t realise that it\u2019s like flushing a plastic bag down the toilet.\u201d\n\nIn the US, some cities are taking legal action against companies for misleading the public about their product\u2019s \u201cflushability\u201d. In 2015, the city of Wyoming in Minnesota filed a class-action suit against Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, Nice-Pak, and three other wet-wipe manufacturers for fraudulently promoting their products as flushable.\n\nAlthough wet wipes are a favourite for cleaning babies, it\u2019s not just parents who are the culprits: Keep Britain Tidy research shows that younger people are most likely to flush, not bin, with 65% of 18-24 year olds admitting to putting wet wipes, sanitary products, cotton buds, cotton wool products or condoms down the toilet.\n\nIn an effort to further combat this bad habit, the London assembly last year called for sanitary bins to also be introduced in men\u2019s toilets. Meanwhile in Newcastle, Northumbrian Water is trying to win the hearts and minds of the public with its upbeat Love Your Drain campaign and mascot Dwaine Pipe.\n\nCity to Sea\u2019s message is simple: only flush the \u201c3Ps\u201d \u2013 pee, (toilet) paper and poo.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep seeing increases in our water bills because of the amount of money the water companies pay for cleaning the sewers,\u201d Fee says. \u201cWe are going to keep seeing the degradation of the marine environment from the increase in plastic pollution in our rivers and seas.\n\n\u201cWe need more awareness of the situation. Then there is legislation and producer responsibility. It can\u2019t just come down to the public. It has to be either the government taking action, or introducing extended producer responsibility where the polluter pays for the damage they cause.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Fatbergs clogging city sewers consist of 0.5% fat and 93% wet wipes \u2013 so a new campaign encourages people dispose of wipes responsibly", "authors": ["Matthew Jenkin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e044862f13f9005c6d33852d220451c55b72476e/0_302_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f15cf3b05a7af94f117767536a4dd42f", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
