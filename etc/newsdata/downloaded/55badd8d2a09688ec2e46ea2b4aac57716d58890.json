Gavin Newsom announced this week that he would ask state Attorney General Xavier Becerra \u2014 the same guy who is always suing the Trump administration \u2014 to investigate whether oil and gas companies are to blame for high fuel prices in the state.\n\nAs if Newsom and the Democratic Party had nothing to do with the problem. Prices are usually the outcome of many factors, but in this case California Democrats share directly in the blame.\n\nIn 2017, for example, Democrats used their supermajority in both houses of the state legislature to force through a 12-cent-per-gallon gas tax, ostensibly to pay for transportation infrastructure that they had failed to account for in the actual state budget. The public reacted angrily, and Republicans won a rare recall election against first-term Sen. Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) in June 2018, who was one of the Democrats lending key support to the gas tax hike.\n\nDemocrats did all they could to rig that election. As Breitbart News noted in 2018 (original links): \u201cDemocrats began changing the rules for recall elections \u2014 by allowing unlimited contributions from fellow elected officials, by letting voters rescind their signatures on recall petitions, and by moving the date of the recall election to the June 5 primary.\u201d All to no avail: voters punished Newman\u2019s gas tax vote by recalling him by a nearly 60-to-40 margin.\n\nThe California GOP then gathered enough signatures to place a gas tax repeal on the November 2018 ballot. The party\u2019s gubernatorial candidate, John Cox, made repealing the gas tax the centerpiece of his campaign against then-Lt. Gov. Newsom. The issue was one of the few on which the majority of California voters agreed with the GOP. The gas tax is a regressive one, falling disproportionately on working-class residents who must commute for work.\n\nBut then, in one of the most egregious acts of political fraud ever committed, the state\u2019s Democrats \u2014 in this case, led by Becerra himself \u2014 gave the referendum, Proposition 6, a misleading title, using \u201cEliminates Certain Road Repair and Transportation Funding\u201d for \u201cGas Tax Repeal Initiative.\u201d Moreover, instead of voting \u201cNo\u201d on the gas tax hike, California voters would have to vote \u201cYes\u201d on Prop 6, creating additional confusion for the electorate.\n\nOpponents of the repeal also allegedly used contractors for the California State Transportation Agency (Caltrans) to campaign against Prop 6 during work hours, stopping traffic illegally to do so. And it was not as if California Democrats ever intended to restrict the money for transportation. In May, Oakland announced it would divert $2.9 million from the gas tax to pay for lighting \u2014 even as the city paid for attorneys for illegal aliens facing deportation.\n\nCalifornia Democrats have made fuel expensive in many other ways. The state is rich in oil and gas potential, but restricts drilling to a few areas, and Democrats are trying to eliminate it in places where it already exists. The state \u2018s Low Carbon Fuel Standard raises prices 12 to 14 cents per gallon. And California\u2019s cap-and-trade system, which Gov. Newsom defended against a Trump administration lawsuit this week, is raising local gas prices even more.\n\nSo it is laughable that Newsom and California Democrats are now pretending, like O.J. Simpson, to find the real culprit. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like your best friend stealing your wallet, and then helping you look for it when you notice that it\u2019s missing,\u201d said one letter-writer to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThat is an accurate description, except for one detail: California Democrats are not the voters\u2019 \u201cbest friends.\u201d On this issue, at least, that title belongs to Donald Trump.\n\nJoel B.
