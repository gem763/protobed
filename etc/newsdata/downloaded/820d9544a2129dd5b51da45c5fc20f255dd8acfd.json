Laquna Moss said her father died shortly after being bitten in two incidents while battling cancer.\n\nAPPEALS COURT RULES VA MUST PAY VETS' ER BILLS AT NON-VA HOSPITALS\n\n\"I am shocked, horrified and downright maddened by the news that a veteran under the care of the VA was treated so poorly and without any regard for his wellbeing,\u201d Isakson, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, said in a strongly-worded statement. \u201cThis patient, at the end of his life, was clearly not being monitored closely enough, and I am so sad for his family who had to discover his insect-infested conditions before anything was reportedly done.\n\nMoss said she found ants all over Marrable's room, including the ceiling, walls and beds, during a visit, WSB-TV reported. She said her father was covered in swollen red bumps and both his hands were covered in bites.\n\nShe told the news station the room was cleaned and her father was bathed, but the ants came back the next day. Marrable was moved to another room, where he later died.\n\n\u201cHe served his country in the Air Force, and I think that he deserved better,\u201d Moss told the outlet.\n\nThe VA apologized for the conditions and the staff's actions, the station said. The agency said the nursing home was cleaned and inspected for ants.\n\nThe VA did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIsakson said he is demanding answers from recently-confirmed VA Deputy Secretary James Byrne.\n\n\"I've also spoken with the veteran's daughter and offered to help in any way I can to ensure that her family is taken care of and that those who allowed these conditions to persists to be held accountable to the fullest extent.\"", "description": "Sen.
