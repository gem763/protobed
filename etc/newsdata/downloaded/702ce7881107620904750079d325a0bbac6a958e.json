And in having more and more say in the industry. The award-winning films Waru and Vai have been a natural outcome of her fearless, collaborative approach. And, and as she outlines to Dale, there\u2019s much more to come.\n\nKia ora, Kerry. I see that you whakapapa to Scotland and to Papua New Guinea, which has me wondering how that combination came about.\n\nWell, my dad is from Papua New Guinea. He grew up in Raluana, a village in Kokopo, on the island of East New Britain. His people are Tolai. I\u2019m from the Tolai clan. And that\u2019s where I grew up.\n\nBut my mother, Robyn, was Scottish. She was a Paterson from Glasgow. But she left Scotland when she was 11 years old with her wh\u0101nau. They went to South Africa and she grew up there fighting apartheid and working for free, pretty much all her life.\n\nShe was a volunteer in lots of places. And, when she saw that there was a volunteer job going in Papua New Guinea, teaching teachers, she thought: \u201cThat\u2019s for me.\u201d So she set off from South Africa to Papua New Guinea and arrived in Rabaul.\n\nOne of her first memories was coming in on the boat and all the little children of the island rowing out in their canoes. They were really excited because this ship was bringing them pencils. And she stayed on there, married my dad, and had us three children. She died there, a Papua New Guinean.\n\nTell us a little bit about your dad.\n\nMy dad was whangai\u2019d. His mother had eight children. Her sister, Rabonni, wasn\u2019t able to have children. So my dad was given to her. He was the lucky one because he got to have two mums. My Bubu Rabonni raised him but, in the holidays, he\u2019d travel back to his mother\u2019s village and work there with her. So he got the benefit of having two wh\u0101nau, which was great for us because we had two grandmothers. That was really lovely.\n\nIn Tolai culture, you\u2019re given only one name. And his name is Warkia. That means \u201ca change\u201d. His mother had already had two children who\u2019d died. When she was pregnant with him, she decided to call him Warkia in order to invoke a change, I guess, in her life. There were many children after him.\n\nHe grew up there but then went on to study agriculture at the university through the YMCA in Melbourne. Then he came home to Papua New Guinea and worked in agriculture and with youth. That\u2019s how he met my mum, who\u2019d got her job through the YMCA. Then they started a family and their whole life was in service to young Papua New Guineans.\n\nI\u2019m familiar with Rabaul having travelled there as a young guy. I used to sing in a cabaret group with my family. We were lucky enough to head up there in the early \u201880s and performed at Bougainville, Kieta, Rabaul, Lae, and down in Moresby as well. And I was fascinated by the country \u2014 partly by the way it\u2019s resisted colonisation.\n\nPNG has had the advantage of being such a difficult terrain, geographically, that the colonisers have found it too hard. We have over 800 different languages. And they\u2019re actual languages, not dialects. And, through all the different tribes and provinces, we have such differing belief systems. It\u2019s very difficult to try and change beliefs that are so ingrained.\n\nI feel like Tonga is hugely similar. The times that I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve adored it because, when you get together for a big Tongan event, it\u2019s so Tongan and they\u2019re celebrating themselves. It\u2019s the same in Papua New Guinea. We have all kinds of celebrations that we call \u201csing sing\u201d and festivals celebrating all of our rich and diverse culture. And our independence. We don\u2019t celebrate western markers in history like Guy Fawkes because we haven\u2019t been colonised in that way.\n\nAnd what about your Tolai clan? Tolai have a language of their own, do they, Kerry?\n\nYeah, the language is Kuanua. Of course, there\u2019s the language of pidgin English, too, which you can speak pretty much anywhere you go in Papua New Guinea. That\u2019s a language that started through trade with the Chinese, English, Japanese and Germans, and so on.\n\nIn most places, everyone speaks pidgin. And we have English in most places, too. I think Hiri Motu is the other official language. But Kuanua is the language of my father and his people. That\u2019s what they speak.\n\nAnd you can speak and understand Kuanua?\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t speak Kuanua fluently. I understand bits and pieces, especially when my family are talking to me. But pidgin is my first language. And English is my second.\n\nWhere did you do your schooling?\n\nI went to school in the city, in Lae. My parents worked really hard to pay the fees for us to go to an international school.\n\nCan we talk about West Papua for a mo? That\u2019s a PNG province which is now administered politically by Indonesia. It\u2019s a touchy subject, isn\u2019t it? And there\u2019s a campaign to rid West Papua of Indonesian control.\n\nMost Papua New Guineans are standing in solidarity with the West Papuans, who are being subjected to what really is genocide. I have lots of friends who\u2019ve come over the border from West Papua, and who\u2019ve lived and worked with my family. It\u2019s such a devastating thing that\u2019s going on there. It\u2019s an awful situation.\n\nPeople with cameras can be the eyes and ears of a society. These days, even more so than ever before. And film can be used as a great tool to bring about social change. Is that what led you into your mahi as a filmmaker?\n\nWell, I was always interested in performing when I was at school in Papua New Guinea. I think performance and art is in every culture around the world. It\u2019s a natural and important part of being human. All of our stories and our knowledge are passed on to the next generation through art of one form or another, whether it\u2019s carving, painting or performance art or whatever.\n\nWhen I was at school, I was in love with theatre and acting and I got a scholarship to come to Unitec\u2019s drama school in Auckland. But when I came out of drama school, there weren\u2019t any roles for me. The content that I was seeing on the screen didn\u2019t reflect the Aotearoa that I was part of.\n\nSo, Kiel McNaughton \u2014 who\u2019s both my life partner and my business partner \u2014 and I just started telling stories that reflected us and our interests. The first film we made was a documentary about our son, Apeal, called Family Ties.\n\nApeal (Api for short) is M\u0101ori, Chinese, and P\u0101keh\u0101 through Kiel, whose father is a fourth-generation Kiwi from Scotland. And, through me, he\u2019s also a Tolai Papua New Guinean and Scottish.\n\nHe was this next generation of New Zealand children who are a mixture of all kinds of cultures. We weren\u2019t seeing that on the screen. So, we made this documentary which traced our son\u2019s heritage and which also focused on what Kiel was going to pass on to him.\n\nAnd TVNZ picked it up and commissioned it. They realised that there was a space for these kinds of films. That was an eye-opener for us, so we started telling more of these under-represented stories.\n\nJust while we\u2019re at it, you and Kiel have an interesting name for your production company, Brown Sugar Apple Grunt. I wonder what\u2019s behind that.\n\nBrown Sugar Apple Grunt is a dessert that we like to eat a lot of. But we also felt it kind of was us as well. Brown celebrates our ethnicity. Sugar symbolises the fun we like to have. Apple is a reminder to be natural and authentic. And Grunt is getting the work done.\n\nNo doubt, when you were learning the trade, initially as an 18-year-old at Unitec, you had some influential teachers and role models.\n\nMy mother, my grandmothers, and aunties were my first role models. Grounding me in my culture and family.\n\nDuring that study period, we had teachers who made sure that we were authentic and that our culture was a strength for us, not a weakness. And there were students who were coming into their own and who mostly went on to work in the theatre.\n\nMiriama McDowell is someone I really looked up to when I was at drama school and who\u2019s an incredible actress. I\u2019ve been especially lucky to work with her. Cohen Holloway, who\u2019s an amazing actor, and Madeleine Sami was someone else coming through at that time. Then there was Taika, who\u2019d started picking up momentum. And Roseanne Liang and Toa Fraser. These are all people that I could identify with and look up to. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with Jennifer Ward-Lealand, too.\n\nIn a way, these and others were peers, but they were also ahead in their own careers. So they were shining the light in areas that we could start moving to and working in.\n\nAnd, inevitably I\u2019ve been influenced by strong women who came before us, like Merata Mita and Gaylene Preston who, in different ways, laid the foundations for us and our work. And in terms of the Pasifika realm, I\u2019d say that Sima Urale has done that as a director. Roseanne Liang with Banana in a Nutshell and My Wedding and Other Secrets is another of those inspiring women.\n\nI\u2019d say that there are many different inspirations for us from the past and now in the present who are walking ahead into the future and allowing us to see what we can apply to the work that we do.\n\nI can\u2019t help but note your collaborations with other indigenous women. It\u2019s important that the stories and perspectives of our w\u0101hine from this part of the world are put on screen. But I\u2019m assuming that women filmmakers are particularly important because they have a different touch.\n\nIn filmmaking, the essence is collaboration. For something to be really good, there needs to be different perspectives, techniques and skills from lots of different people. That\u2019s essential to get a film from the seed, right through to the screen.\n\nAnd collaboration is absolutely my jam. It\u2019s a place where I love to be. When a whole team starts working in synergy, incredible things happen. As they did with Waru. And with Vai.\n\nAnd I do think that women definitely have a different touch and perspective. The way we view the world is different and so are our life experiences. And we bring those differences to our work when we\u2019re making films.\n\nI find that, when it\u2019s a collaboration of women, it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s been life-changing for me. And, while it\u2019s an inherently indigenous way to work, it takes a lot to get everyone together, to keep them together, and to hold on to the kaupapa. There\u2019s a lot of work that goes into that.\n\nBut I also think that having women on set is really important. Having them in places of decision making, and of power, is also important to the whole dynamic of making a film. So, I\u2019ve tried to exercise that, to have diversity of sex and of culture, so that we can enrich our work by having many different perspectives.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s still talk in the industry about \u201cthese people\u201d \u2014 women or people of colour \u2014 not being skilled enough. Or not being able to hold a kaupapa. Or that the market will not support them.\n\nWe can find a million excuses every day for not hiring women or people of colour in certain areas. But it\u2019s the producer\u2019s job to make the space for setting up everyone for success. If those people need extra help to get them to a point where they can succeed, then organise that help.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s about doing that, rather than putting it off until they go and get the experience somewhere else. They\u2019re not going to get the experience until we give them the opportunity for the experience.\n\nI\u2019m passionate about creating opportunities and I\u2019m sick of the old song sheet that some people still continue to sing from in this industry, which is that we don\u2019t have diverse writers who can write well enough. Or we don\u2019t have writers from different cultures who can write a mainstream drama series.\n\nI believe those people exist. If they\u2019re lacking in some area, we find the fix for that. We find a solution for that. And, yes, it\u2019s more work. Yes, it\u2019s a budget cost. But we can do it. We can either make the excuses not to do it, or we can just do it.\n\nIn this process, you\u2019re building confidence in other indigenous w\u0101hine filmmakers. And you\u2019re helping to develop a global network by sharing our stories and films. You\u2019re building the foundations of a wonderful platform. Do you ever think that you\u2019re part of a really valuable advance guard?\n\nYou flatter me. But I do feel privileged to be able to contribute to that space and, like you say, to help build that confidence. Not just in the people making the films, but also in the people who\u2019re buying and distributing them.\n\nI think that\u2019s really important. And it\u2019s also important that we\u2019re building audiences. We are conditioned, and have been conditioned, by what we\u2019ve seen on television and in the movies over the years. We\u2019ve assumed that there\u2019s a limited range of people who make films. But now we\u2019re seeing that there are many talented people from all cultures who can do the same thing.\n\nAnd these new films are joining the likes of The Orator, Mahana and Once Were Warriors and Taika\u2019s film Boy in taking their place among great New Zealand films. I\u2019d say Stallone Vaiaoga-Ioasa is in this new space as well, with his Three Wise Cousins, Hibiscus, Ruthless, and now Take Home Pay.\n\nAlso female-written and directed films like Waru, Vai, The Breaker Upperers \u2014 these films are building audiences and showing how different perspectives and cultures can be entertaining or comedic or dramatic, or whatever it is that you\u2019re looking for on a small screen or in a cinema.\n\nIt\u2019s whanaungatanga, isn\u2019t it, when there\u2019s this sharing of resources and credits. Waru and Vai are examples of this and provide a contrast with the conventional filmmaking scene which can be quite dictatorial and where the directors and producers have all the say. But, here, the approach is collaborative. There\u2019s the term \u201csister-films\u201d which you say proudly, I assume. But it\u2019s also a decent enough description of your approach.\n\nYeah. Definitely. There\u2019s the saying \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats\u201d. And yeah, I am proud that these are sister-films because of how we\u2019ve designed them. We create a framework so that each writer-director has individual merit, as well as sharing a collective merit. And the voices together can speak louder and make more impact.\n\nAlso, being able to uplift and support the careers of many women with one film is fantastic. It\u2019s great that both Waru and Vai have been to A-list festivals and those writer-directors with them. That\u2019s been fantastic.\n\nIt\u2019s like a Sing-sing, isn\u2019t it? Where everyone brings their skill sets.\n\nExactly right.\n\nThere\u2019s another element in this world of Pasifika filmmaking because there are voices from various directions. From Polynesians, from Melanesians, and from Micronesians. What do you make of that?\n\nI\u2019ve been having discussions about the kind of cinema coming from indigenous people on this side of the world. Talking at times about whether it\u2019s Oceanic cinema or Moana cinema, or what exactly it is. But what makes our work unique is our specificity.\n\nThe stories from, say, the Solomon Islands, the Cook Islands, or S\u0101moa, are quite distinct. The storytelling, the language, and the actors from all the Pacific nations are all individual. But our voices together, from this part of the world, is a beautiful chorus of individuality as well as this kind of togetherness, and solidarity. And it\u2019s such a beautiful part of the world to speak from.\n\nI think so, too. And there are so many stories to tell. You and Kiel must have a whole lot in mind, swirling around in your heads\n\nYes, we do. We usually have a good plate of development projects. At the moment, we\u2019ve just produced a film called The Legend of Baron To\u2019a. It\u2019s set in a cul-de-sac in Mt Roskill, an Auckland suburb. It\u2019s an action-comedy. This is Kiel\u2019s film-directing debut. It\u2019s starring Uli Latukefu, Nathaniel Lees, Jay Laga\u2019aia, Shavaughn Ruakere, John Tui, Xavier Horan, and Fasitua Amosa. It\u2019s a really fun piece. We\u2019re in post-production on that one now.\n\nWe also have K\u0101inga which will be made by pan-Asian New Zealand women and is exploring migration and the themes of unsettling and settling in a new home and interacting with the tangata whenua. We\u2019re producing this with Shuchi Kothari.\n\nAnd then we\u2019re also talking with Australia about working with the Aboriginal women on a similar kaupapa to Waru and Vai. That\u2019s an awesome project. There are television projects as well \u2014 and we\u2019ve just applied for a second season of The Feijoa Club which is set in south Taranaki and is on the HEIHEI platform. That\u2019s for kids. It\u2019s a fun, very diverse series about a group of mystery-solving kids here in Taranaki.\n\nYour enthusiasm is infectious. And I want to congratulate you for your mahi and for achieving what you\u2019ve already achieved.\n\nWell, there has been hard work, but it\u2019s been fun, too. And life-changing at times with projects like Waru and Vai. For instance, with Vai, we travelled to eight different islands to shoot. That was incredible. In each place, we had some kind of cultural welcome. That stuff really feeds the soul.\n\nThen we get to make something like The Legend of Baron To\u2019a, which is a whole heap of fun, where there was next-level action sequences with some of our incredible stunt coordinators and performers, like Augie Davis, Tim Wong and Andy Stehlin, who are world-class and usually work on the massive films overseas.\n\nIn fact, they\u2019re overseas now, working on big international films that can afford them. But they all came home and brought it together for us, for this local film. One of the beautiful things about the collaborative nature of New Zealand crews is that they do come home and muck in on projects. I think that\u2019s fantastic.\n\nThank you, Kerry, for joining us for this k\u014drero. Is there anything interesting you\u2019d like to add?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know how interesting it is, but I adore gardening. I have this massive garden down here in Hawera, where we live. Our plan is to create a food forest for the community. Gardening is kind of parallel to working in a collaborative space in the film industry. Growing things from seed and then seeing them right through to the kitchen table.\n\nI\u2019ve just put down my potatoes for the next season. But we grow lots of pumpkin, too, and we give them to the school for fundraisers, for hangi. We\u2019ve got a bit of an orchard as well. A feijoa grove, and peach and plum trees too. We grow enough so that there\u2019s extra produce for any wh\u0101nau who need it.\n\nThe other thing I love is travelling. Especially travelling locally with the kids so they can come to understand Aotearoa. I believe it\u2019s important to teach them history that they may not be learning at school, whether it\u2019s about M\u0101ori and the land and the different types of farming, or birds \u2014 or anything that they\u2019re not getting at school. We feel it\u2019s our job to be teaching them that.\n\nAnd teaching them about different cultures. They\u2019ve been home to Papua New Guinea a few times. We went to Canada for Waru and we took all three children. And we were all learning about the First Nations people \u2014 not stuff you get at school, but important life learning.\n\nHeoi an\u014d. Wishing you the very best with the films you have on the horizon.\n\n(This interview was edited for length and clarity.)\n\n\u00a9 E-Tangata, 2019", "description": "", "authors": ["Dale Husband"], "top_image": "https://e-tangata.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/KerryWarkiaC001.jpg"}
