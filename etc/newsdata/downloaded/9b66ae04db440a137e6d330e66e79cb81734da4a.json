It\u2019s an affliction that never ends well", "language": "en", "text": "It is not merely Steve Baker quoting Satan at 1am that casts Conservative Party conference 2019 as a tale of angels and demons.\n\nOf course, it is theoretically possible to read too much into a complimentary latte hurriedly placed and then instantly snatched from Boris Johnson\u2019s hand but really, all our names were on that little Starbucks cup.\n\nWere they just two press aides, there on the prime minister\u2019s shoulders? Or were they temptation and salvation themselves, God and Lucifer, crackling with a mutual loathing of a voltage that was frankly dangerous while walking past the display stand of the UK\u2019s leading electrical cabling manufacturer?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing. In that moment, when the unsanctioned cup is wrested from the prime minister\u2019s febrile grasp, salvation won. Quite possibly for the very first time in the 55-year history of a man whose hands tend to find themselves clasped around whatever they so desire, temptation was defeated.\n\nWhy had it waited until now to walk among us, this angel of Boris Johnson\u2019s better nature, in the form of a brutalising civil servant revelling in the cold-blooded viciousness of an office civil war?\n\nHow different our little lives might have been if \u201cno disposable cups\u201d lady had descended from the celestial realm whole decades before.\n\nNo disposable cups. No \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d. No secret families. No groping. No denials of groping that no sentient being could ever possibly believe. No blatant lies. Perhaps, maybe, just maybe, even no Brexit.\n\nAll of which is a hyper-extended introduction to make up for the transparent fact that Boris Johnson\u2019s first party conference speech as prime minister cannot be written about. There is nothing to say. It contained not a single policy announcement, at all. Nothing. Thirty-seven minutes of stale old gags and polite applause and a whole lot of meaningless noise.\n\n\u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d has been writ large all over Manchester for five grim days under relentless rain. And here we are, still essentially clueless as to how it\u2019s going to happen.\n\nAs the audience waited for their shaved orangutan hero, the speakers played \u201cI\u2019m A Believer\u201d by the Monkees. And why not? A believer is what you have to be. Because there\u2019s nothing else to go on.\n\nIt is perhaps unfortunate, though entirely self-inflicted, that the broad theme of this event has not been getting Brexit done, or even the \u201cexciting new domestic agenda\u201d, which isn\u2019t exciting, and certainly isn\u2019t new, as Boris Johnson has admitted that his \u201c20,000 new police officers\u201d are absolutely no more than a replacement for the 20,000 his two predecessors removed.\n\nInstead, he has had to talk over TV interviewer after TV interviewer, as he tries to style out claim after claim after claim that he definitely did not grope a young woman under a table 20 years ago, even though he can\u2019t remember the incident, at all. And he absolutely definitely did not act with any impropriety whatsoever, when tens of thousands of pounds worth of public contracts were awarded to a woman with whom he does not deny having a sexual relationship with.\n\nHe has genuinely tried to say that the allegation that he grabbed a young journalist\u2019s upper thigh is being thrown at him because there are \u201cmany people out there who want to stop Brexit\u201d. These people, we are expected to believe, must therefore include those who saw fit to publish said allegation in the Brexit-backing Sunday Times.\n\nIt was hardly the only occasion on which things turned out not to be what they seem. On Sunday, excitable delegates rushed to a fringe event called \u201cChallenging Islamophobia\u201d. It turned out not to be helpful suggestions for how Conservatives might challenge Islamophobia when they encounter it, but instead, how to challenge accusations of it. That, it turns out, is how the party is going to solve its Islamophobia problem (the one into which Boris Johnson promised to launched an enquiry on live television) \u2013 by coming up with new and innovative ways to deny its existence.\n\nI\u2019m a believer. Some of them even sung the words to themselves. They really mean it. Trouble is, we are a month away from Brexit, and Johnson has nothing to offer beyond the same banal platitudes of three and a half years ago.\n\n\u201cWe are about to take a giant step,\u201d he said, \u201cto relaunch ourselves into the world!\u201d\n\nMeaningless noise. It doesn\u2019t mean a thing. On the morning of the speech, he had announced the new backstop-replacing proposals he was sending to Brussels. A take-it-or-leave-it offer. Credible analysts of this stuff are united in their view they are not credible proposals, that they are not designed to be credible.\n\nAt the end of the speech, neither temptation nor salvation could be found. Traditionally, someone takes questions from journalists about the speech that has been given.\n\nFor the first time ever, they refused. Well, I say for the first time ever, they refused on Sunday too, when temptation wandered into the press centre to give a four-word statement on the groping claims. \u201cThis allegation is untrue.\u201d That was it. There were no questions allowed then either.\n\nPerhaps that wasn\u2019t meant to be credible either. Who are we to know?\n\nThe alternative to these quite literally incredible proposals, they will have us believe, is no-deal Brexit.\n\nExcept that parliament has legislated to prevent it, and has told him he must ask for an Article 50 extension.\n\nNo deal on 31 October will be breaking the law. And it is not so easy to break the law when you lead a party that, only yesterday, in the words of Priti Patel claimed \u201cits rightful place as the party of law and order\u201d. (It did so an hour after having to expel one of its own MPs after police were called to a row he was having with a security guard.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done!\u201d They were his final words, and most meaningless of all.\n\nHe knows he hasn\u2019t got a clue how to do it. They don\u2019t, though. They\u2019re believers. There\u2019s not a trace of doubt in their minds. They\u2019re in love.\n\nThey\u2019re in love, specifically, with Boris Johnson. It is a terrible affliction that has served him well over the years.\n\nIt never ends well for anybody else, though.", "description": "It is not merely Steve Baker quoting Satan at 1am that casts Conservative Party conference 2019 as a tale of angels and demons.", "authors": ["Tom Peck"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/12/boris-speech-7.jpg"}
