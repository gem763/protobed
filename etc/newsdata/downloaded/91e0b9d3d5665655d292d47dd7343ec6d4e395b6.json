The White House eventually released a rough transcript of a presidential phone call that triggered the complaint, and it showed that Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to launch an investigation into 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nThe Trump administration has since prevented witnesses contacted as part of the inquiry from testifying, including Gordon D. Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who was subpoenaed Tuesday after skipping a previously scheduled appearance on Capitol Hill at the executive branch\u2019s urging.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Trump said later Tuesday that the administration will not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, calling it \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u201d Ms. Pelosi responded. \u201cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
