These initiatives are likely to reflect on the third-quarter performance.\n\nThe company stated that Ryzen and EPYC processors and data center GPU revenues more than doubled on a year-over-year basis in the last reported quarter, a trend that is likely to have continued in the third quarter.\n\nNotably, AMD recently rolled out its new Radeon RX 5500 Series designed to deliver smooth gameplay in 1080p.\n\nNotably, the company has also introduced Radeon RX 5500M GPU with 7nm technology for notebook PCs. The new line of GPUs includes several technologies, including Radeon Image Sharpening, AMD FidelityFX and Radeon Anti-Lag.\n\nThe company\u2019s move to improve its processor portfolio strengthens competitive position against the likes of NVIDIA NVDA. We believe AMD\u2019s portfolio strength is likely to have helped in expanding customer base and consequently the top line in the third quarter.\n\nThe company also announced latest lineup of Ryzen PRO 3000 Series desktop processors. With the aid of these products, AMD has been foraying into the high-end graphics card market. Consequently, if the latest GPU has been able to cater to the rising demand of users, then the impact is likely to get reflected in the company\u2019s third-quarter revenues.\n\nMoreover, the third-quarter performance is likely to reflect strong adoption of EPYC server processors. Notably, increasing adoption of AI techniques and ML tools in industries like gaming, automotive and blockchain are primarily responsible for driving GPU demand. The third-quarter results are likely to have benefited from this demand, with the company launching new graphics cards.", "description": "AMD's ongoing GPU roll outs, deal wins and product enhancements are likely to bolster top line in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Zacks Equity Research"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LEXdv6GN4iga40WZ8JMCJA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/de4a571dabfe991df6a592b151105380", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
