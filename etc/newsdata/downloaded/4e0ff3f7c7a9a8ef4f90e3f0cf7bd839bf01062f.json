Birthed from the indigenous rhythms of Akan music and incorporating western instrumentation such as electric guitars and horns before being played in the 1920s at exclusive gatherings of the upper colonial class \u2013 hence the music\u2019s name \u2013 to now fusing American rap motifs in the sub-genre hiplife, Ghana\u2019s most popular musical export is ever-changing. Yet, one of its greatest living exponents, vocalist Pat Thomas, has also been one of its most consistent representatives.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pat Thomas and Kwashibu Area Band: Obiaa! album art work\n\nDubbed \u201cthe golden voice of Africa\u201d, Thomas has been performing his honeyed tenor on highlife tracks for the past 50 years \u2013 a feat only rivalled by peer Ebo Taylor. Both men have recently had career-defining revivals, with Taylor releasing the excellent Appia Kwa Bridge in 2012 and Thomas making an album with the Kwashibu Area Band in 2015. Following a world tour for that record and the acquisition of a younger, globalised fanbase, Thomas\u2019s second outing with his band is aptly called Obiaa! \u2013 everyone.\n\nThere is a palpable feeling of joyous inclusivity on Obiaa!, one that is harnessed in that necessary exclamation point, as this is active, kinetic music. While Thomas\u2019s lyrics aphoristically tackle the perils of \u201cshowing off on social media\u201d on Onfa Nkosi Hwee and the merits of \u201cbeing patient in life\u201d on Ntobuase, he delivers each line with an unshakeable optimism, his \u201cgolden voice\u201d still radiant and full of light.\n\nBandleader Kwame Yeboah keeps the rhythm section glued to their clattering clave patterns, with Kweku Mensah and Kwesi Yeboah providing the sparkling guitar melodies so integral to the genre. The opening suite of Onfa Nkosi Hwee, Yamona and Bubu take on the dance band tradition of highlife, with the horn section providing effusive bursts of harmonic counterpoint, while downbeat numbers such as Obinim and Odo Ankasa allow Thomas\u2019s voice full reign over their love-lorn balladry. Amid our penchant for curated archive compilations of far-flung genres, here is the living, breathing testament to a music that is very much still alive and being championed by those who have spent their lives perfecting its craft. Long may it continue in all its world-spanning complexity.\n\nAlso out this month\n\nGuatemalan singer-songwriter Gaby Moreno releases a luscious, string-laden collection of songs, \u00a1Spangled!, celebrating the music of the Americas from Panamanian bolero to Brazilian bossa nova. Accompanied by storied producer Van Dyke Parks, Moreno presents a beguiling argument for the power of musical migration. Cuban trumpeter Yelfris Vald\u00e9s releases his debut album, For the Ones \u2026, an experimental mix of Yoruban chants, undulating electronics, piercing horns and propulsive Cuban jazz. It\u2019s an engrossing and expansive listen. Fellow Cuban Roberto Fonseca also releases his ninth album, Yesun, a tight-knit trio set that traverses the pianist\u2019s mastery of Afro-Cuban rhythms, as well as modern classical and even reggaeton. Highlights are the plaintive Por Ti and the frenetic Aggua.\n\n\n\n", "description": "(Strut Records) The \u2018golden voice of Africa\u2019 reboots the Ghanaian form for a new, globalised fanbase", "authors": ["Ammar Kalia"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77a395c364b42bca5a2263f5c4cac14368e26a78/0_1191_3744_2247/master/3744.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4512c324eba73eae1daefc8aca9c551f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
