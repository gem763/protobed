Stephen Lynch told reporters that Reeker, whose portfolio includes Ukraine and Russia, was a \"much richer reservoir of information than we originally expected.\"\n\n'No earth-shattering revelations,' Republican says\n\nBut Reeker, according to the source who asked not to be identified, was largely out of the loop on policy toward Ukraine, leaving it to Kurt Volker, then the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, and others.\n\n\"There's no earth-shattering revelations. Nothing is new,\" Republican Rep. Scott Perry said after several hours of testimony. \"The accusations that are being levelled against the president aren't being corroborated in any of this witness testimony and today in my opinion is no different.\"\n\nReeker submitted to questioning in response to a congressional subpoena that was issued after the State Department attempted to block his testimony, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe testimony was the first since a federal judge on Friday rejected a claim by Trump and his Republican allies that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry process was illegitimate because the full House had not voted to authorize it.\n\nRepublican Rep. Scott Perry said 'nothing is new' in what Reeker said on Saturday.
