Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D) both falsely claimed on Tuesday at the Democrat debate that President Donald Trump in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky threatened to without military aid to the country unless he agreed to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s dealings in the country.\n\n\u201cYou know, when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he\u2019s digging up dirt on an opponent,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThat\u2019s illegal conduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he was doing,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk to him about the Russian invasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe talked to him about that,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\nBiden agreed with Klobuchar\u2019s narrative and claimed the Ukraine phone call was one of three times Trump has asked foreign entities to tamper with U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cThis president on three occasions \u2014 three occasions \u2014 has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe fact is that it is outrageous.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nUkraine Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told the BBC on Tuesday that President Donald Trump did not order Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter and that Trump did not threaten to withhold foreign aid in a phone call between the two leaders in July. When the BBC radio host asked Prystaiko what he knew about the phone call that sparked the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Trump, he said he knew \u201cquite enough\u201d and \u201cheard it myself.\u201d \u201cSo I can\u2019t agree with what you said that the president mentioned this \u2026 that he would like us to investigate,\u201d Prystaiko said. Instead, Prystaiko said Trump said on the call, \u201cIf I were you I would instigate each and every corruption case.\u201d \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a direct order as some are trying to picture,\u201d said Prystaiko, who was the deputy foreign minister but is not the country\u2019s foreign minister. The BBC host then asked Prystaiko to confirm that he was saying that Trump did not order an investigation into the Bidens. \u201cThere\u2019s no blackmail here,\u201d Prystaiko said. Prystaiko also spoke with the BBC about the allegation that Trump threatened to withhold military aid if Ukraine didn\u2019t cooperate with the president\u2019s alleged request for an investigation into the Bidens\u2019 dealings in the country. \u201cThe military aid never was mentioned in the telephone call,\u201d Prystaiko said, adding that the aid was granted \u201cwithout any investigation started.\u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s no direct link, and it was not that directly said by President Trump,\u201d Prystaiko said. Prystaiko said that Ukraine gets funding from both the State Department and the Pentagon, evaluation of that aid is done every year, and negotiations about the latest aid had been going on for close to a year. He also said Ukraine doesn\u2019t want to be involved in politics. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sucked into the internal politics of the United States, which we want to stay away from,\u201d Prystaiko said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "Democrats at the primary debate falsely claimed that President Trump threatened to without aid from Ukraine if Biden was not investigated.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Biden-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
