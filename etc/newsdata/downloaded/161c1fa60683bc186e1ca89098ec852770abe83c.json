There is no going back from the streets after today.\u201d\n\nLebanon ranked 138 out of 180 in Transparency International\u2019s 2018 corruption index, while citizens suffer chronic electricity and water shortages.\n\nLebanon\u2019s political system was set up to balance power between the country\u2019s religious sects, including Christians, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims and Druze.\n\nBut critics say it entrenches political patronage and pits citizens against each other along sectarian lines.\n\nWhat some have dubbed the \u201cWhatsApp revolution\u201d has support from wide swathes of Lebanese society.\n\nThe protests have been mostly good-natured, with people singing or launching into traditional dabke dances.\n\nIn Beirut, a group of young demonstrators camped out in a paddling pool, while a couple of newly-weds joined the crowd in the town of Jiyeh south of the capital.\n\nBut while the demonstrators are largely united on what they oppose \u2014 with many condemning the entire political class as thieves and criminals \u2014 they lack a clear set of demands.\n\nOn Sunday, Lebanese abroad also gathered to demonstrate in Paris, Los Angeles and Washington.\n\nOn Friday, Hariri did not say what would happen if the government did not back key reforms by Monday night, with the 72-hour deadline widely mocked among protestors and on social media.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Thieves\u2019 \u2013\n\nScuppering Hariri\u2019s unity call, Samir Geagea, head of the Christian Lebanese Forces party announced late Saturday that his four ministers were quitting the government.\n\n\u201cWe are now convinced that the government is unable to take the necessary steps to save the situation,\u201d Geagea said.\n\nOther members of the government, including Shiite movement Hezbollah and the Christian Free Patriotic Movement, oppose the government\u2019s resignation.\n\nDemonstrators hailed Geagea\u2019s announcement but demanded more wholesale change.\n\nZalfa Aboukais, 27, was hanging signs bearing the names of lawmakers and ministers on barbed wire near parliament and the seat of government, saying they were all \u201cthieves\u201d.\n\nShe said she was protesting \u201cagainst the hooligans who have been in power for 30 years\u201d.\n\nLebanon is one of the world\u2019s most indebted countries, with a deficit of around $86 billion \u2014 more than 150 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 according to the finance ministry.\n\nPublic anger surged after parliament passed an austerity budget in July as part of efforts to make reforms that are essential to unlock over $11 billion in economic assistance pledged by international donors last year.\n\nGrowth has plummeted in recent years, with political deadlock compounded by the impact of eight years of war in neighbouring Syria.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets to condemn political stasis and corruption Sunday,\u00a0the largest in four days of demonstrations that have crippled the country and threatened the coalition government.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Leabonan-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
