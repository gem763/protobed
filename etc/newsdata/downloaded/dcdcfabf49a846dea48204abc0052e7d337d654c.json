So if much of her new album, Charli, already sounded familiar to fans, that\u2019s because it should: about half of the album\u2019s tracks were released as singles before its release, spanning back almost a year. This would have been unthinkable before streaming. But Charli uses the instant nature of modern platforms to her advantage, upending the traditional idea of an album and growing her audience in the process.\n\n\u201cI was feeling very creative and wanted to release my music rapidly and when I wanted,\u201d Charli tells me. \u201cWithout streaming, it would be so difficult to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nWe all know that streaming has changed the way we listen to music, but it\u2019s also changing the way artists write and release music. With streaming, artists can instantly put their music online, which lets them test out songs, release music on a whim, or even adjust albums after they\u2019re released. Charli has always been at the cutting edge of pop, and she has built a career around disregarding norms, including traditional release structures. It\u2019s increasingly becoming a trend as more artists are leaving the tried and true album cycle behind.\n\nThe traditional album cycle has existed for decades. Instead of releasing music whenever it\u2019s done, artists save up songs to build into a big album drop that happens every couple of years. \u201cYou put out a single, maybe a second single,\u201d explains Charlie Harding, host of the podcast Switched on Pop, which is published by The Verge\u2019s sister site Vox. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of gaining some press attention to remind people your favorite artist is putting out that big, important package thing that you need to go out and buy.\u201d\n\nThis worked great before streaming when people had to buy physical albums on things like CDs or vinyl. But now, few artists have the luxury of being forgotten for two years and then coming back to try to make a media splash. Everything is available at our fingertips, and fans are hungry for content all the time. \u201cEverything\u2019s very rapidly digested, and people want more,\u201d Charli says. \u201cEverything moves so much quicker now.\u201d\n\nCharli XCX released about half of the album\u2019s songs as singles\n\nTechnology has always dictated the ways artists release music. The flat record was commercialized in the 1890s, and from that time all the way through the 1960s, singles were popular because early kinds of records could only hold around three minutes of audio. Around the 1950s, the LP was introduced, which was a longer format that could hold up to 52 minutes of audio. And the album as we know it was born.\n\nThe traditional album continued with the cassette and then the CD through the 2000s when digital services like iTunes popped up. iTunes allowed people to pick and choose what songs they wanted to buy from albums instead of forcing them to buy the entire thing. This was the beginning of singles coming back, and now, with the rise of streaming services, singles are popular once again.\n\n\u201cArtists are putting out more individual songs because you can,\u201d says Zane Lowe, global creative director and host of Apple Music\u2019s Beats 1 station. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wait around anymore, get into a queue, wait for a record label or some company to tell you it\u2019s your turn up to bat. When you\u2019re sitting there with a really good song, even though you\u2019ve just put out an EP or project or a mixtape or an album, but you\u2019re like, \u2018I want to keep it moving,\u2019 you can.\u201d\n\nCharli XCX\u2019s new album is a perfect blueprint of the new album landscape. Chatter about the album first started in late May when she tweeted, \u201cyour mother is about to feed you new music for 5 months straight.\u201d Shortly after, the album was officially announced on Instagram. From around that time up until the album\u2019s release date of September 13th, she released about half of the album\u2019s songs, including \u201cBlame It On Your Love\u201d feat. Lizzo and \u201cGone\u201d with Christine and the Queens. On top of that, she also released tons of singles not meant for an album, like a Spice Girls remix with Diplo, a track for BTS\u2019s new mobile game, and club bop \u201cFlash Pose\u201d with Pabllo Vittar. And they\u2019re racking up hundreds of millions of streams across platforms.\n\nangels, your mother is about to feed you new music for 5 months straight. you deserve it and you\u2019re welcome. \u2014 Charli (@charli_xcx) May 21, 2019\n\nCharli isn\u2019t the only artist doing this. Entire genres like hip-hop and dance have been playing with singles, mixtapes, and rapid-fire releases for ages. Other genres, like pop, have been slower to experiment, but that\u2019s changing. You might have noticed that a lot of your favorite artists from all sorts of genres are consistently dropping more singles. The term for this is called the \u201cwaterfall strategy,\u201d and it\u2019s becoming more popular.\n\nBebe Rexha, Billie Eilish, and The Chainsmokers are among the artists doing this. They will put out singles month after month, eventually bundling them into an EP or an album. Every time a new single is put out, it gives a boost to the other ones released before it. Zach Fuller, a media analyst for MIDiA Research in London, told Billboard last year that this strategy works because it constantly refreshes an artist\u2019s page with new material. \u201cIf you do discover it [from a playlist], you are innately more likely to go to the [artist\u2019s] page, and Spotify has the latest releases at the top,\u201d he says. The idea is that albums are built, not dropped.\n\nAlbums are built, not dropped\n\nStreaming hasn\u2019t just changed the album; it\u2019s also changed the way songs are written. Artists are competing with shorter attention spans and the tens of thousands of songs uploaded every day. A song needs to be listened to on most streaming platforms for at least 30 seconds to trigger a payout. As a result, songs are becoming shorter, and artists are front-loading all the catchy bits to keep a song\u2019s skip rate as low as possible.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m writing a song that is for another big pop artist, I want to play all the games,\u201d Charli says. \u201cChorus within the first 30 seconds. No weird self-indulgent intro\u2026 Hook at the top in the intro, maybe even start with the chorus, under three minutes. I think that radio songs should be two minutes, 20 [seconds]. Get in, get out, everybody just get on with your life, you know?\u201d\n\nCharli XCX says the formula used to just be about making the \u201cmost pop hit song\u201d possible, but now there\u2019s talk about skip rates in studio sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s all about: did you grab them in that first five seconds? And did they add it to their playlist?\u201d she says.\n\nThe way Charli releases music isn\u2019t as rogue as it used to be. Songs like \u201cNever Really Over\u201d by Katy Perry and \u201cOMG\u201d by Camila Cabello feat. Quavo have yet to appear on albums. And tons of big-name artists are taking advantage of streaming\u2019s freedom in different ways. Last year, Ariana Grande said she no longer wanted to subscribe to the two-year album cycle, telling Rolling Stone, \u201cMy dream has always been to\u2026 put out music in the way that a rapper does.\u201d Then, she dropped two albums within months of each other. And Kanye West edited a track on Ye to remove a sample five months after the album was released.\n\nMany have declared that streaming, and its contribution to the rise of singles, killed the album, but Harding and Lowe disagree. Instead, they see what\u2019s happening as an evolution of the album, giving rise to an era where artists have the freedom to experiment in ways that were never possible before. \u201cI think that we\u2019ll see a lot of artists who are going to play with the form and idea of an album,\u201d says Harding. \u201cThat will delight us, excite us, and change our idea of what an album can be.\u201d\n\nEssentially, streaming\u2019s dominance means there\u2019s no \u201cright way\u201d to release music anymore. Instead, it\u2019s about what fits for an individual artist, and, for Charli, what fits is being spontaneous. \u201cYou can travel and create your own buzz via all the tools that are available for us to work on our own,\u201d Charli says.\n\nPlus, she says, streaming means listeners get to pick who\u2019s worth hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bunch of white males at radio stations and record labels deciding what the general public should listen to.\u201d\n\nMake sure to check out other episodes of The Future of Music here.", "description": "In the fifth episode of The Future of Music season 2, Dani Deahl visits pop star Charli XCX to talk about why she releases so many singles and how streaming has changed the way she writes music.", "authors": ["Dani Deahl", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LRMAtuqIqfQWKk6gVtLoy42uE4g=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18329753/pcheung_190715_3541_0002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
