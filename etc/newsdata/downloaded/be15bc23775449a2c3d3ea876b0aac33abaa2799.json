The figure comprises disbursement of Central Provident Fund (CPF) housing grant, loss on the sale of flats as well as the expected loss for flats under development.\n\nFor the FY2018/2019, HDB sold a total of 16,608 new flats, down 38 percent from the 26,857 flats sold in the previous year.\n\nIt also disbursed $532 million in CPF housing grants, an increase from the $466 million it disbursed a year before.\n\nHDB launched about 15,300 Build-To-Order flats across 18 projects during the period under review, including 1,620 flats within the new Tengah town.\n\nREAD: HDB Reveals Bishan BTO Plans: Analysis + What You Should Know\n\nMeanwhile, HDB\u2019s deficit came as no surprise to analysts.\n\nNicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty, said the deficit \u201ccomes usually from selling the flat below market price\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne interpretation of (the deficit) is to say that they have given larger discounts to the BTO (Build-To-Order) flats \u2013 the new flats that they sold,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Steven Choo, chairman of real estate consultancy VestAsia Group and Adjunct Associate Professor at the National University of Singapore\u2019s School of Design and Environment, also attributed the higher deficit to the recent delays in BTO launches.\n\nThe August sales exercise had been moved to September to enable home buyers to benefit from the enhanced grants and raised income ceiling.\n\n\u201cBecause of the social mission of HDB, it is recognised that a deficit of this nature will occur. It is a recurring thing, so that\u2019s not surprising,\u201d explained Dr Choo.\n\nRead our handy HDB Buying Guides or find a resale HDB flat on PropertyGuru.\n\nVictor Kang, Digital Content Specialist at PropertyGuru, edited this story.
