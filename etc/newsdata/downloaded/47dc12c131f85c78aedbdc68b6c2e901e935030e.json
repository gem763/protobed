Over the past six years, Emirates has placed orders for, or expressed serious interest in, the newest jets produced by Boeing and Airbus, such as the Airbus A350, Airbus 330neo, Boeing 777X and Boeing 787.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, Clark warned the manufacturers he won\u2019t take any of the jets until Airbus and Boeing can deliver the reliability Emirates expects.\n\nSafety is not an issue, Clark said, but Emirates cannot afford to keep pulling its most expensive assets from service because the airframe or engine needs repair. He said Emirates aims to achieve at least 99.5 percent reliability from its fleet, and expects to do little maintenance on an airplane for the first five years of its life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t like the A330,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we won\u2019t like the 787-9 and -10. I\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t like the A350. These are hugely potent aircraft that eventually will get all their operations sorted out. They are outstanding designs. Unfortunately they\u2019re not being put together as well as they should be.\u201d\n\nGE and Rolls-Royce Complaints\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion in a hotel conference room, Clark said Emirates will honor its purchase commitments, but said contracts protect the airline from accepting delivery of aircraft that do not hit specifications, for range, fuel burn and other metrics, that had been promised.\n\nAnd he hinted Boeing is not close to providing what it has promised for the Boeing 777X. Emirates has ordered 150 of the next-generation jets, but Clark said he is concerned about General Electric\u2019s engine design.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, the Boeing 777X is delayed as a result of engine issues, and we are unsure as to when this is going to be resolved\u201d Clark said. \u201cI have been in this business longer than I like to remember, and I have seen airline and engine developments which are beset with problems. The airlines are now being required to deal with those, and work together with manufacturers to get them resolved. I say no. I say, \u2018you give us airframes and engines that work from day one.\u2019 If you can\u2019t do it, don\u2019t produce them.\u201d\n\nClark said he has similar concerns with a top GE rival, Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the A380, as well as other jets.\n\n\u201cThere is no stability in the Rolls-Royce program at the moment as we see it,\u201d Clark said.\n\nAfter learning Clark\u2019s comment, a Boeing spokesman said, \u201cThe safety and performance of our aircraft is our top priority. We are working closely with GE and Rolls-Royce as they resolve some challenges with their engines.\u201d\n\nAn Airbus spokesman was not available for comment.\n\nReliability Troubles\n\nClark is far from the only airline executive to express dismay at the current state of airplane and engine manufacturing, though Clark\u2019s comments may have been the sharpest. Before he retired in July, Norwegian Air CEO Bjorn Kjos also regularly publicly criticized Rolls-Royce, blaming it in part for the airline\u2019s financial woes.\n\nWorldwide, airlines have been forced to ground airplanes for extra inspections or to change engines sooner than expected because of problems with Rolls-Royce engines on Boeing 787s. British Airways and Norwegian have been forced to charter jets from other operators in order to fly the schedule they promised to consumers.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Emirates President Tim Clark on Wednesday sharply criticized Boeing and Airbus along with engine suppliers Rolls-Royce and General Electric for failing to make reliable products, saying the companies may lose business as the global economy slows and airlines become more selective about which planes they", "authors": ["Brian Sumers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_ap.nJ3owe5gHNVHB9CsBw--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/skift_501/07955b762b26880ae8c7c8f4e205e5f1", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
