I used to do it, but you just don\u2019t need to do it any more. You can see everything, you can watch everyone\u2019s training on YouTube. There\u2019s no value in doing that sort of thing, absolutely zero.\u201d\n\nSat alongside assistant coach John Mitchell, the former All Blacks boss who he faced off against in the 2003 semi-finals while in charge of the Wallabies, Jones admitted it would be no surprise if the unwelcome training attendee did transpire to be someone from the All Blacks camp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no idea mate but I think Mitch used to be one of them,\u201d he joked. \u201cOn snapchat he\u2019s got 15 different disguises!\n\n\u201cEveryone knows what everyone does and there are no surprises in world rugby anymore. That\u2019s the great thing about the game, you just have to be good enough on the day.\u201d\n\nEngland due employ two security guards to keep an eye out on potential spies at training, and with Jones set to run his main training session on Wednesday afternoon, staff will be on red alert for any unwelcome visitors at their training base.\n\nEngland prop Joe Marler however was not so clued up on the incident, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t see anyone. It was too windy. I doubt he\u2019d have got much anyway, it was tipping it down.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones believes England\u00a0were spied on in their Tuesday training session ahead of their Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand.
