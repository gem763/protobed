The thing about Manchester City\u2019s start to this season is that there is no great surprise at Liverpool\u2019s supremacy.\n\nCity are struggling badly at the moment, perforated by injuries and the indifferent form of key individuals.\n\nTheir hopes of winning a third title on the bounce are looking increasingly bleak. Liverpool now have the biggest lead after eight games in Premier League history.\n\nAdama Traore's late goals gave Wolves a huge win over Manchester City who slipped up in their chase for the Premier League\n\nTraore coolly slotted past Ederson for his first goal after great work from Wolves' forward Raul Jimenez who set him up\n\nDeep into injury time Traore bagged his second goal as Manchester City were punished for their notable profligacy up front\n\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo was left delighted at the result which leaves Manchester City's title hopes in real danger\n\nBefore Traore's brace the Wolves' man had only scored one Premier League goal despite his constant threat from out wide\n\nTraore's opener took only nine seconds once Joao Cancelo lost the ball in the Wolves half as Nuno's side countered to effect\n\nThe bare bones of this defeat for City were that Wolves were magnificent \u2014 fully deserving of Adama Traore\u2019s two goals in the final 10 minutes \u2014 and the home team were dreadful. Picked off at will and barely creating meaningful chances of their own, this was as bad as we have seen under Pep Guardiola.\n\nOnly two shots on target, a passive midfield \u2014 it is no exaggeration to say Wolves could have inflicted far more damage. As it was, they had to settle for a first win here for two decades. City ended up with five bookings and failed to score a home goal for the first time in 45 Premier League matches. Forced into hopeful crosses or long-range shots, their patience went out of the window.\n\n\u2018It was a bad day,\u2019 conceded Guardiola. \u2018We didn\u2019t play well. We have to improve, we weren\u2019t solid in our build-up. It is not just about the defensive side.\u2019\n\nWolves were far more energetic, despite their 4,000-mile round trip to Istanbul to face Besiktas in the Europa League on Thursday.\n\nJimenez had a fantastic opportunity to open the scoring on 20 minutes before Fernandinho put in two last-ditch blocks\n\nThe Mexican then had a strong penalty shout turned down as he fell under the challenge of stand-in centre-back Fernandinho\n\nJimenez was furious at referee Craig Pawson for not awarding the penalty as he was through on goal before the challenge\n\nManchester City's injury-ravaged defence looked ragged throughout, conceding opportunities at will to Wolves' forwards\n\nThe normally ruthless Sergio Aguero cut a frustrated figure at the Etihad as he struggled to find the space that he is used to\n\nMATCH FACTS Manchester City (4-3-3): Ederson 6.5; Walker 5 (Zinchenko 46, 5), Otamendi 3, Fernandinho 6, Cancelo 5; Gundogan 5, Rodri 5, D Silva 5.5 (Jesus 75, 6); Mahrez 6 (B Silva 60, 6.5), Aguero 6, Sterling 6 Subs not used: Bravo, Angelino, Foden, Garcia Manager: Pep Guardiola 5 Wolves (3-5-2): Patricio 7; Boly 8, Coady 8, Saiss 6 (Bennett 13, 8); Traore 9, Dendoncker 7, Moutinho 7, Neves 8, Vinagre 7 (Otto 74, 6); Jimenez 8, Cutrone 5.5 (Doherty 68, 6) Subs not used: Ruddy, Vallejo, Gibbs-White, Kilman Manager: Nuno Espirito Santo 8 Ref: Craig Pawson 6\n\n\u2018My players ran like crazy,\u2019 said manager Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\nDefensively, this took you back to Guardiola\u2019s first campaign in charge. It was complete and utter carnage, with Nicolas Otamendi having one of those days that City supporters fear is never too far away for him.\n\nGuardiola is privately agitated at the club\u2019s unwillingness to pay the money required to land top target Harry Maguire from Leicester in the summer, puzzled why City quibbled over \u00a315million for someone who he badly wanted. History may view that as a chronic error.\n\nOtamendi\u2019s fingerprints were smudged across all of the Wolves chances long before Traore\u2019s late double, although Guardiola shielded him afterwards, bemoaning a lack of protection.\n\nThere were so many Otamendi moments that it was difficult to keep track. First, the Argentine charged to win a ball he had no hope of claiming on halfway, Traore\u2019s delivery passing him by and leaving Fernandinho despairingly out of position. Patrick Cutrone, who only has one goal this season, skewed wide.\n\nOtamendi was later indebted to defensive partner Fernandinho for bailing him out. Wolves broke and Otamendi needlessly went to ground just outside his penalty area, before Fernandinho blocked Raul Jimenez\u2019s shot and then headed Cutrone\u2019s follow-up clear.\n\nIncredibly, more followed.\n\nThis time Otamendi\u2019s lax pass left Fernandinho in all sorts of trouble as Jimenez raced beyond the Brazilian who, to his immense credit, somehow managed to hold the striker up long enough for Ederson to intervene.\n\nRomain Saiss was forced off injured 13 minutes into the game and was replaced by Ryan Bennett in Wolves' defence\n\nRiyad Mahrez has been in sparkling form for Manchester City but couldn't find the magic to break down Wolves' backline\n\nFollowing back-to-back goals against Everton and Dinamo Zagreb in recent displays, Raheem Sterling was well-marshalled\n\nCity were struggling for creativity and their midfield was out- muscled. They lacked runners beyond Sergio Aguero while one particularly sprightly teenager \u2014 Phil Foden \u2014 remained on the bench. Riyad Mahrez\u2019s volley, blocked by Conor Coady, was their best chance and a Raheem Sterling effort on the half-turn forced Rui Patricio into a decent two-handed stop. Joao Cancelo made his full league debut, starting at left back in the absence of Benjamin Mendy.\n\nIt was a tough assignment against Traore, whose main trick is to hit the byline at pace. The right-footed Cancelo could not handle him and Guardiola sacrificed the out-of-sorts Kyle Walker at half-time \u2014 introducing Oleksandr Zinchenko and shifting Cancelo to his preferred right flank. Walker had been nursing a stomach infection.\n\nCity\u2019s issues were perhaps summed up best when Wolves counter-attacked from a corner, with Rodri and Cancelo cautioned simultaneously amid a panic to halt the threat.\n\nThere was growing discontent in the stands and dissent on the pitch, with Ederson yellow-carded for complaining to referee Craig Pawson after David Silva was penalised for a foul. Silva, rather uncharacteristically, hurled abuse in frustration \u2014 it was that kind of afternoon. Meanwhile, Wolves could not capitalise on two further mistakes by Otamendi. Home pressure never truly materialised, although Silva struck the bar from a free-kick before then hoicking the ball over the top.\n\nCity searched for a winner but Otamendi was not done yet.\n\nPep Guardiola pondered what substitutions to make as he failed to overcome the tactical traps that Wolves sprung all game\n\nGabriel Jesus (left) tried to provide a spark in attack but was thwarted when Willy Boly showed his bravery by heading the ball\n\nBoly was always in the right place at the right time to make vital interceptions for Wolves' organised, well-drilled defence\n\nWolves broke after Cancelo conceded possession and the Etihad\u2019s intake of breath was sharp.\n\nNow we had Jimenez against Otamendi. The defender went to ground again. The defender was bypassed again.\n\nJimenez slipped the ball to Traore, who finished beyond Ederson for his first goal in 13 months. His second came shortly after, in stoppage time, when he ran clear and pushed the ball past the goalkeeper.\n\nThe goals and result had been coming and City\u2019s corporate Tunnel Club became a scene of aggravation with away supporters refusing to conceal their delight.\n\nOne bearded German gentleman on Merseyside will have felt exactly the same way.", "description": "JACK GAUGHAN AT THE ETIHAD: Manchester City put in a lacklustre performance and were made to pay by Wolves after Adama Traore scored a late second half brace to secure the three points.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/16/19364052-0-image-a-87_1570374918675.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
