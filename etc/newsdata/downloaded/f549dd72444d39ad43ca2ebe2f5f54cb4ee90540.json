Symptoms of severe listeriosis usually begin within two or three weeks after exposure and can include severe headache, confusion, neck stiffness and loss of balance.\n\nPeople with weakened immune systems, over the age of 65 or pregnant are considered most at risk, according to the CFIA. Listeriosis during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn and stillbirth.\n\n\"The CFIA is verifying that industry is removing recalled product from the marketplace.\"\n\n5 chicken recalls since August\n\nAnyone who has any of the recalled products is advised to throw them out, or return them where they were purchased.\n\nThis recall update was triggered by CFIA \"surveillance activities,\" according to the advisory.\n\nIt comes on the heels of a previous recall issued on Sept. 27, which included fewer products. At that time, the extent of the distribution was listed as \"retail\" in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan and \"possibly national.\"\n\nThree other chicken product recalls were issued in August.\n\nAll five are related to the ongoing investigation. Based on the findings to date, Rosemount brand cooked diced chicken has been identified as a \"likely source of the outbreak,\" according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n\n\"Rosemount cooked diced chicken was supplied to institutions (including cafeterias, hospitals and nursing homes) where many of the individuals who became sick resided, or visited, before becoming ill,\" the website states.", "description": "A recall warning about imported cooked diced chicken meat due to possible Listeria contamination has been expanded to include more than 50 products supplied to hotels, restaurants, hospitals and other\u00a0institutions across the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305189.1569969914!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cooked-diced-chicken-meat-recall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
