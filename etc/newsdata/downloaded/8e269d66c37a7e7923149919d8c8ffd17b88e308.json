Their School Ignored, Lawsuit Alleges.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "Some white students at Chaska High School in Minnesota ended last school year the same way they began it: In photos, wearing blackface.\n\nThe academic year in the 28,000-person suburb began in September 2018 with white students attending a football game in blackface, and, in one student\u2019s case, an afro. In December, a middle school student in the same district\u2014located roughly 30 miles southwest of Minneapolis\u2014found that his gym shirt had been stolen, vandalized with the n-word, and returned to his locker. In February 2019, two white students in the district put on charcoal face masks and put the photos on social media with the hashtag: #blackface.\n\nThat same month, another student allegedly posted on Snapchat, holding a gun, and threatened to shoot a list of students if they attended a Chaska High School assembly on race relations. In April, white students posted an image on Snapchat with the faces of 25 African-American students, calling the location \u201cNegro Hill.\u201d\n\nThe lede on a local news story in April began: \u201cChaska, it happened again. Another racially charged incident in Eastern Carver County Public Schools.\u201d\n\nAnd by the time a photo of a student wearing blackface appeared in the yearbook in May, the response from parents on the newly created Equity Task Force was: \u201cNot again, are you serious? The same exact issue of blackface again?\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, they\u2019d had enough.\n\nSix current and former students from the district filed a 50-page civil-rights lawsuit in federal court against Independent School District 112, also known as Eastern Carver County Schools, claiming that teachers and administrators demonstrated \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d and failed to take \u201cany meaningful action\u201d in response to repeated complaints of racist bullying.\n\nThe school district \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to black students who were called the n-word, \u201cmonkey,\u201d told they \u201cdon\u2019t belong,\u201d and threatened with physical violence, the lawsuit claims.\n\n\u201cSchool staff have little, if any, proper training or experience with respect to properly responding to reports of racism,\u201d according to the complaint, which alleges that \u201coften times, complaints of discrimination are simply met by silence.\u201d\n\nStudents of color were even prohibited from posting \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs and materials featuring African-American leaders during Black History Month, the lawsuit states.\n\nFour of the six students in the lawsuit relocated from the district as a direct result of the racism they experienced over the past few years, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe Minneapolis Star-Tribune first reported the legal action, which followed months of pressure from parents in the school district, where only 3 percent of students are black, per data from the Office of Civil Rights.\n\nAmanda Flowers Peterson told the Star-Tribune last month that her 6-year-old son was punched in the face\u2014twice\u2014by a classmate and \u201ctold he doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d Administrators declined to call the incident racially motivated, she said.\n\nPeterson and her husband are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which says that they removed their son from the district after repeated concerns about neglect\u2014including an incident where he was allegedly left unsupervised for 45 minutes after he was sent home on the wrong bus and another where he was sent outside for recess for 20 minutes in 23-degree weather with no coat on.\n\nSchools officials called Amanda Peterson, who is black, \u201ctoo aggressive\u201d when she complained, the lawsuit states. In May 2019, a substitute teacher with the district \u201ccontacted Ms. Peterson\u2019s employer and demanded she be fired\u201d over her advocacy efforts to correct the racism that had systematically affected the district, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe six students are seeking a jury trial to determine damages in excess of $75,000 over the mental anguish and emotional distress caused by the racism at the school district.\n\n\u201cAt some point, enough is enough,\u201d attorney Anna Prakash, who represents some of the families, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOur public schools are supposed to respect and keep children safe while creating an educational environment in which they can thrive. That didn\u2019t happen for African-American students in Chaska,\u201d said Prakash.\n\n\u201cOur clients tried and continue to try to get help from the administration,\u201d said Prakash, \u201cBut, with all they have experienced and because meaningful change has not happened, they filed this lawsuit.\u201d", "description": "Star Tribune via Getty ImagesSome white students at Chaska High School in Minnesota ended last school year the same way they began it: In photos, wearing blackface.The academic year in the 28,000-person suburb began in September 2018 with white students attending a football game in blackface, and, in", "authors": ["Olivia.Messer Thedailybeast.Com", "Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WH._NFOmkvpZwfBu2Rjfug--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/c181e0ec11989d1a277f26c4ca1057a4"}
