She had decided as soon as her now husband, Gary (44), proposed in 2014 that she\u2019d be handing the \u00a390 (R1 665) dress over to the charity.\n\nSusie, who tied the knot in 2017, wanted to help other families after she suffered three miscarriages over four years and two of her family members give birth to sleeping babies.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the pain of thinking everything is going fine, then going through birth and then having a stillborn child,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine having to pick clothes out [for a funeral]. Nobody wants to bury their child but if they are, they want them in something special. You\u2019d want them to wear something so beautiful that actually fits.\u201d\n\nSusie described Cherished Gowns as an amazing charity and that donating her dress was something she was more than willing to do.\n\n\u201cEveryone said to me it was such an amazing thing to do, to donate my dress. But it wasn\u2019t me, it\u2019s them. I\u2019m just so grateful the charity exists.\u201d\n\nSources: Magazine Features\n\n", "description": "A woman who\u2019s suffered three miscarriages has donated her wedding dress to be made into thousands of funeral gowns for stillborn babies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9438/14b0a7f5d4ac4820aaecc7f62cd6481f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
