But they also want people to learn from what happened to their daughter.\n\nCourt testimony makes it clear that multiple people knew Levick shouldn't be driving, Sue and Paddy Brown point out, and yet someone let him use their car.\n\n\"If you know somebody who's driving without a licence, that is doing something that can potentially just destroy a family \u2014 you need to stand up and do something about it,\" Sue Brown told CBC News.\n\n\"Especially with all the seniors that are on the road right now, if you know your parents shouldn't be driving, you need to do something.\"\n\nMeaghan Brown was 27 years old when she died. (Meaghan Brown/Facebook)\n\nMeaghan Brown was riding her motorcycle to her new job at Teck Metals on July 25, 2016, the day of the crash. It wasn't quite 6 a.m., but the sun was up and the weather was clear and dry, according to a B.C. Supreme Court judgment.\n\nBrown had just passed a slower driver on Highway 3B, near Trail, when Levick suddenly cut in front of her to make a slow left turn across traffic in a 2014 Subaru Forester.\n\n\"There was no opportunity for the motorcycle to avoid a collision, and it crashed into that vehicle,\" Justice Michael Tammen said when he found Levick guilty in March.\n\nBrown was pronounced dead at the scene. It was two days before her 28th birthday.\n\n'Reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others'\n\nLevick told police and bystanders that he never saw the motorcycle coming. Investigators would later discover his driver's licence had been cancelled in 2001 after an optometrist found he was medically unfit to drive.\n\nLevick has diabetes and an associated condition called diabetic retinopathy that can lead to blindness. An ophthalmologist testified that Levick had been legally blind for years at the time of the crash.\n\nThe court also heard that staff at the ophthalmologist's office had alerted Levick's doctor in 2011 that Levick was still driving and he warned his patient to stop.\n\n\"Nonetheless, with full knowledge of his extreme visual impairment and the attendant risks, the accused chose to drive. The mere act of setting out behind the wheel \u2026 would constitute reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others,\" Tammen wrote in his decision to convict Levick.\n\nMeaghan Brown, centre, is shown as a child in a family photo with her parents Paddy and Sue and her older sister, Sarah. (Paddy Brown)\n\nBrown's father believes the fatal crash would never have happened if the people in Levick's life had reported him to the police. Court records do not reveal whose car Levick was driving.\n\n\"People don't want to report a member of their family or somebody that they know because it's taking away their independence and their freedom \u2026 but they're putting people's lives in danger,\" Paddy Brown said.\n\nThree years after the tragic crash, the Browns can't escape their sorrow over losing their youngest of two daughters.\n\nMeaghan Brown loved motorcycles and tattoos, and was stepmother to a little girl who shared her first name, her parents said. She was learning how to drive a big rig, and was excited about her future at the new job.\n\n\"I used to talk to her every single day. We were just the best of friends. This driver took away my past, my present and my future with my daughter, and it's been heartbreaking \u2014 absolutely heartbreaking,\" Sue Brown said.", "description": "Theodore Levick has been sentenced to two years behind bars for criminal negligence causing the 2016 death of Meaghan Brown in Trail, B.C.", "authors": ["Bethany Lindsay Has More Than A Decade Of Experience In B.C.
