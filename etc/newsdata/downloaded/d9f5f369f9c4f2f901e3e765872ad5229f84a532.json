But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., criticized Trump\u2019s word choices.\n\n\u201cThat is one word no president ought to apply to himself,\u201d Clyburn said on CNN after the president\u2019s tweet was read to him. \u201cThat is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.\u201d\n\nRep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., called on Trump to delete the tweet.\n\n\u201cDo you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet,\u201d wrote Rush, who is also black.\n\nTrump has a habit of trying to portray himself as the victim.\n\nHis tweet came a day after he lashed at critics of his decision \u2014 since rescinded \u2014 to schedule a major international economic summit for 2020 at one of his Florida golf properties. He lashed out during remarks Monday at people who invoke \u201cthis phony emoluments clause.\u201d\n\nThe clause is in the Constitution and bans presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments, without the consent of Congress. Impeachment and its process are also in the Constitution.\n\nA whistleblower\u2019s complaint that Trump was attempting to use his office for personal political gain during a July 25 phone conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to open the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump insists he did nothing wrong. He has characterized the conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as \u201cperfect\u201d and argues that sore-loser Democrats are still trying to overturn the 2016 election that put him in the White House and keep him from winning a second term next year.\n\nWhites used lynchings as a way to resolve anger toward blacks across the South, where people were blaming their financial problems on newly freed slaves living around them, the NAACP notes.\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump injected racial overtones into the House impeachment inquiry Tuesday by comparing the Democratic-led", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/22/fcfffe_trump-28270-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-speaks-cabinet-meeting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
