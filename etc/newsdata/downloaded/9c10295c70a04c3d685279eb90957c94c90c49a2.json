They were calling for a new war in Colombia.\n\nBack in 2016 the pair had made regular appearances on television screens across the country - and the world - dressed in white shirts, symbolic of the historic peace accord they had finally reached with the government after four years of internationally mediated negotiations in Havana. Mr Marquez had led the FARC\u2019s negotiating team with Mr Santrich also at the table.\n\nNow, just three years on, they were dressed in green coveralls and armed with automatic rifles in what appeared to be a new jungle camp somewhere in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe country\u2019s peace process has already faced a number of significant setbacks and still has fierce opposition from many who despise it, but the declaration is perhaps its biggest test yet.\n\nAnalysts say it could go one of two ways: provide a much-needed strengthening of a fragile peace process, or jeopardise it, sending the country hurtling back towards war.\n\nSenior commander Ivan Marquez(C) and fugitive rebel colleague, Jesus Santrich, of the dissolved FARC rebel army group in Colombia, on an undisclosed location of Colombia announcing that they are taking up arms again along with other guerrillas who have distanced themselves from a peace accord signed with the government in 2016 (AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nIn the video Mr Marquez, flanked by twenty other armed men, snapped back into his former Marxist rhetoric as if he had never flirted with civilian life.\n\n\u201cThis is the continuation of the rebel fight in answer to the betrayal of the state of the Havana peace accords,\u201d he said in a 32-minute video in which he blamed the government for not having kept its end of the peace deal.\n\n\u201cWe were never beaten or defeated ideologically, so the struggle continues.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nInternational proxy war played out in concerts on Venezuela border\n\nThe deal was internationally lauded for formally ending a 52-year war which killed over 260,000 and displaced 7 million as the FARC, paramilitaries and the national army fought each other bitterly for control of territory.\n\nBut it has been fraught with setbacks.\n\nSocial leaders voicing their support of the accord are being killed at a shocking rate - 627 seven local activists since the deal was signed, according to local NGO Indepaz.\n\nThe pledges the government made to develop neglected regions of the country remain little more than pledges, encouraging dissident rebels to abandon the process and return to warfare.", "description": "Colombians awoke to two familiar faces on their TV screens on Thursday morning as breaking news bulletins broadcast images of two men - Ivan Marquez and Jesus Santrich - former senior leaders of the now-demobilised guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).But this time it was", "authors": ["Luke Taylor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ualEHKJUATlkFlf7cyEP_g--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/050e22bc42efc3d49e116a0b02fc398c"}
