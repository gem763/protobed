Its removal has sparked disapproval of Apple among Hong Kong protesters and residents.\n\nApple in a statement obtained by the AP said the app \"has been used to target and ambush police\" and \"threaten public safety.\"\n\n\"Criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\" Apple said. \"This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\"\n\nThose who have already downloaded the app still have access to it, AP reported.
