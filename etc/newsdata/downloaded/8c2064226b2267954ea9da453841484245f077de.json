Say goodbye to long days, afternoons at the pool and less busy commutes. It\u2019s all rather fleeting, isn\u2019t it? Well, if you\u2019re hoping to convert at least a little bit of that summer magic into some lasting memories, and meals, let\u2019s take a look back at our most popular recipes of the summer. Starting with No. 10 \u2026\n\n10. Classic Barbecue Chicken, above at top right. Here\u2019s a fitting dish to break out for the long holiday weekend. A delicious from-scratch sauce, juicy meat \u2014 you couldn\u2019t ask for much else.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n9. Rainbow Sprinkle Icebox Cake. Even if it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s birthday, there\u2019s always some reason to celebrate with this stunning, delicious no-bake treat.\n\n[How to make an icebox cake, the coolest (literally!) no-bake dessert]\n\n8. Curried Chickpea Salad Sandwiches, above at bottom right. You\u2019ve probably come across a curried chicken salad, but chickpeas? We love this riff from Food editor Joe Yonan, which is bright in flavor and color.\n\n[If you love your vegetables, these plant-based dinner recipes are for you]\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n7. Fresh Tomato Sauce. There\u2019s still plenty of time left in tomato season to make this no-fuss, fast (less than an hour!) sauce. Make a bunch and freeze the bounty to enjoy during the winter.\n\n\n\n(Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n6. Shells With Bacon, Zucchini and Sweet Onion. If you\u2019re looking for an even lighter pasta topping than the red sauce above, consider this unique combination.\n\n[These 6 light, summery pasta recipes let you save the red sauce for cooler days]\n\n\n\n(Photos by Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n5. Summer Fruit Crumble. Soft, sweet fruit. Crunchy, buttery topping. Yes, it\u2019s a pure delight, so what are you waiting for?\n\n\n\n(Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n4. Sweet Cream Ice Cream Base. We adore this no-egg recipe from Jeni Britton Bauer of Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams. Use it to make any flavor you want, and yes, the corn syrup, cornstarch and cream cheese are important to its fabulous texture.\n\n[How to create the ice cream of your dreams]\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n3. Corn, Radish, Tomato and Tortilla Chip Salad. Nachos for dinner is awfully tempting, but if the craving strikes and you want something lighter and better for you, this colorful dish is the answer.\n\n[We\u2019ll give you an earful \u2014 of summer corn recipes]\n\n\n\n(Laura Chase de Formigny for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n2. The Nilsson. This near-zero-proof cocktail from our Spirits writer, M. Carrie Allan, is definitely the epitome of summer, thanks to coconut cream and lime juice.\n\n[No alcohol, no problem: How to make complex, balanced zero-proof cocktails]\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n1. Summer Tomato and Basil Pasta With Pine Nut Sauce. Far and away our most clicked-on recipe of the summer, this dish features a creamy sauce that\u2019s actually nondairy. Instead, pine nuts, lemon juice, salt and olive oil do the trick.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nHow to upgrade your sandwiches with clever twists on 5 classics\n\nWith their powers combined, strawberries, pistachios and olive oil make for one splendid cake\n\n6 great grilled seafood recipes that are fast and flavorful", "description": "It's too soon to give up on barbecue, fresh tomatoes and cold drinks.", "authors": ["Becky Krystal", "Reporter Covering Topics Related To Food", "Becky Krystal Is A Food Reporter", "The Lead Writer For Voraciously.
