Jo Johnson is on the pro-Europe wing of the Conservative party and has previously called for a second referendum to decide the fate of Brexit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an honour to represent Orpington for nine years and to serve as a minister under three prime ministers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn recent weeks I\u2019ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest\u2014it\u2019s an unresolvable tension and [it's] time for others to take on my roles and MP and minister.\u201d\n\nIt's the latest in a series of blows suffered by the prime minister this week. Johnson has lost his first four parliamentary votes as prime minister, has seen his Brexit negotiating position destroyed by parliament, and had his proposal for a general election aimed at solving the Brexit impasse rejected. With no working majority, Johnson is rapidly running out of options and his judgement is being seriously questioned.\n\nRidiculed for his series of missteps by the opposition, Johnson's reputation in his own party has also taken a battering. He fired 21 Conservative rebels for voting against him on Tuesday, including the grandson of his hero Winston Churchill and the party's longest-serving lawmaker.\n\nOne of his own lawmakers said Thursday: \u201cThere\u2019s deep disquiet across the Party at the handling of this issue of the Whip. We can\u2019t win unless our base is broad and representative of all strands of opinion. [Number 10] needs to rethink and fast. I think we are better being like Churchill and NOT Stalin.\u201d\n\nJohnson is expected to deliver a speech later Thursday to make the case to the public for a fresh general election.", "description": "Jo Johnson, one of the prime minister\u2019s Conservative lawmakers, says he can no longer reconcile \u201cfamily loyalty and the national interest.\u201d", "authors": ["Jamie Ross"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1483,w_2637,x_0,y_314/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567679572/RTS2OX9R_qc3mjb", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
