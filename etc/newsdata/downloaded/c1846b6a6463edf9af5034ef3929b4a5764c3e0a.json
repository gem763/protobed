Then the Hezbollah turned up, a truckload of them, dressed in black and shouting through loudspeakers and holding up posters of their all-Shia militia heroes. Squads of Lebanese interior ministry police appeared in the side streets.\n\nIt was perfectly clear to all of us that the Hezbollah, heroes of the Lebanese resistance until they began sacrificing themselves on the battlefields of Syria, were attempting to sabotage the entire protest movement. The young men and women in the street shouted as one: \u201cThe government is corrupt, the sectarian leaders are corrupt, all members of parliament are thieves \u2014 thieves, thieves, thieves.\u201d But they never \u2013 deliberately \u2013 mentioned the name of the Hezbollah chairman Sayed Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah serves in the Lebanese government.\n\nAnd two of the men jumped down from the truck \u2013 big, tough figures towering over the younger protesters \u2013 dodging the police line and moved into the demonstrators, shouting and demanding they end their curses about sectarianism. \u201cThe Sayed [Nasrallah] is the only one who is not corrupt!\u201d one of them screamed. These men did not come to talk to the protesters or discuss their objections or even argue. They preached at them, raising their voices and bellowing their words. For a moment I wondered if I was perhaps in the holy city of Kerbala or Najaf. There is in fact no evidence that Nasrallah is corrupt; but thanks to US sanctions on Syria and Iran, the Hezbollah may be running out of cash.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThen the cops, all riot shields and batons, formed two ranks between the Hezbollah and their adversaries.\n\n\u201cI have come from Nabatieh and I have been here eight days and nothing has happened,\u201d the Shiite \u2013 no friend of the Hezbollah even though Nabatieh is in the militia\u2019s effective area of control \u2013 shouted back.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Will the attacks start now, as they did in Nabatieh this week, when Hezbollah supporters used batons to clear the town\u2019s central square of protesters?\n\nThe signs of government decay are everywhere. When the elderly president Michel Aoun gave a short pre-recorded speech on television on Thursday, it was noticed at once that he had been unable even to complete a short series of sentences in one take. The leather-bound books behind him \u2013 none of which, I suspect, he has ever read \u2013 suddenly changed their position on the shelves between his sentences.\n\nThen a Lebanese journalist, claiming to know all about the broadcast, said that Aoun had fallen asleep between his sentences.\n\nAoun and prime minister Hariri had earlier told the country\u2019s interior minister, Raya al-Hassan, that she must order the interior police to use water cannons to clear the streets of Beirut and the country\u2019s main highways.\n\n\u201cI will not give this order,\u201d she replied. \u201cThis matter is political. It is not a security matter.\u201d Hassan, needless to say, is perhaps the only popular government minister in this country. Nor are the cops or the army unsympathetic to the protesters. Two soldiers were caught on camera weeping with emotion.\n\nThen came the video of minister Akram Shayeb leaving his downtown office to find protesters outside the door. His bodyguards raised their rifles \u2013 some of them apparently fired shots in the air \u2013 and one pointed his gun at a young woman. \u201cDon\u2019t you threaten us,\u201d she cried, ran forward and kicked the gunman in the testicles. The image of her now famous kick is spray-painted on the walls of central Beirut.\n\nIn Martyrs\u2019 Square, the tens of thousands of demonstrators had no time for talk of government \u201creform\u201d. Nor was there a word about a proposed tax on WhatsApp. The men and women here were highly educated, many with their children, and in many cases professionals: doctors, lawyers, university staff. If this protest fails \u2013 and what they want, of course, is constitutional change \u2013 they will in many cases leave their country forever, impoverishing Lebanon for generations.\n\nBut they were not all rich. I saw poorly dressed farming men and women, in plastic shoes, no socks and dirty clothes. When the sky poured, an old man with a crumpled face and a clutch of plastic umbrellas over his arm ran to me and offered to sell me a brolly for 5,000 Lebanese pounds \u2013 about \u00a32.50. When I gave him the money he put it to his lips and kissed the banknotes over and over again, the poor man\u2019s way of expressing his thanks for good fortune.\n\nThe crowds here were deeply impressed by a Shiite cleric whose sermon in Beirut told the people they were right to demand freedom from a sectarian government. \u201cYour religion is between you and God,\u201d Sheikh Yasser Audi said. \u201cFreedom must be exercised, the Prophet said this.\u201d The Lebanese army commander, General Joseph Aoun \u2013 no relation to the near-speechless president \u2013 ordered his soldiers to use no violence against any demonstrators. If they were to be forced back, it must be by pushing them with their bodies, and not by drawing weapons.\n\nI saw several Lebanese soldiers ostentatiously shouldering their weapons with the barrels down and the butts up, a traditional symbol of military personnel when they wish to show they do not intend to use violence. But then again, I saw this in Cairo during the 2011 Egyptian revolution \u2013 and look what happened to that.\n\nAmid the government \u2013 or what is left of it since the Christian Lebanese Forces ministers have resigned \u2013 there was talk of Gebran Bassil, the deeply unpopular foreign minister who is indeed the son-in-law of the near-speechless president, being prepared to resign if the Druze leader Walid Jumblatt withdrew his cabinet members from the government.\n\nIf this is window dressing, the idea is clearly intended to let the mass protests simmer down. I\u2019m not at all sure, however, that this would any longer work. The bolder street demonstrations become, the greater their demands. And the cry for an entirely new constitution that will utterly abandon the sectarian system of government in Lebanon has grown stronger and stronger. There are many in the Arab and Muslim world who will wish them to fail. Bashar al-Assad for one, Sisi of Egypt for another. Certainly Iran. And the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, whose petty \u201creforms\u201d are now utterly overshadowed by the real shout for freedom in Lebanon.\n\nYou can see why all the Arab dictators and kings fear this. If Lebanon\u2019s people \u2013 especially its young people \u2013 succeed in their vast undertaking, then the millions of suppressed and poorly educated men and women across the Arab world will ask why they too cannot have these same freedoms. France supports the Lebanese demonstrators \u2013 which is a bit odd since it was the French after the First World War who imposed this vile sectarianism upon Lebanon. The Americans claim they are on the side of the protests. But I suspect this is because they want the Hezbollah to be disowned by the Lebanese \u2013 rather than a new free nation in the Middle East.\n\nWell, we shall see.\n\nIn the meantime, we will also find out what Hezbollah has in store.\n\nThere is a palpable fear on the streets of Beirut. More than one of the interior ministry cops, I noticed, were wearing black face masks to hide their identity. More powerful than the Lebanese army, the Hezbollah obviously fears for its own popularity, and worries that it will in the future be cast into the outer darkness of Lebanon\u2019s sectarian world rather than hero-worshipped. Their appearance at the demonstration in Riad Solh Street was extremely sinister. And be sure it will happen again.\n\nWho would have thought that the winners of the 2006 war with Israel would align themselves with the political and corrupt elites of Lebanon?", "description": "Those tens of thousands of largely young protesters demanding a non-sectarian Lebanon were joyful, filled with happiness, determined that this time they would change the wretched confessional nature of their state forever.
