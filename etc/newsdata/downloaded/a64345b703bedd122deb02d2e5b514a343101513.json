Earlier, BTC price declined below the $8,200 support area and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A new weekly low was formed near $8,148 and recently the price started a decent upside correction. It broke the $8,200 and $8,300 levels to avoid any further losses.\n\nMoreover, there was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last slide from the $8,471 high to $8,148 swing low. The price even spiked above the $8,400 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. However the upward move was capped and the bulls failed to gain momentum above $8,400. It seems like the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last slide from the $8,471 high to $8,148 swing low acted as a strong resistance.\n\nAt the moment, the price is trading in a range below the $8,400 resistance area. Additionally, there is a new breakout pattern forming with resistance near $8,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Above the triangle resistance, bitcoin price could face resistance near the $8,460 level. A successful close above $8,460 and a follow through above the $8,500 resistance might set the pace for a fresh increase in the near term.\n\nOn the downside, the triangle support is near the $8,280 level. If there is a downside break, the price could retest the main $8,200 support area. Should there be a daily close below the $8,200 support, the price may perhaps continue to slide towards the $8,000 and $7,800 support levels.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin seems to be setting up for the next break. There are high chances of a decent rebound above $8,400 as long as there is no daily close below $8,200.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is showing signs of ranging moves.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is currently near the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $8,200 followed by $8,150.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $8,400, $8,460 and $8,500.", "description": "Bitcoin price is trading in a range above the $8,200 support against the US Dollar.
