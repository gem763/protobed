It\u2019s like her hair, shades and pink furry jacket have all been super-imposed on to a very convincing caricature of Liv.\n\nIt\u2019s pure genius and the detail is just insane. Everything down to her hands is made to look toy-like and quite, frankly, it\u2019s making our head hurt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiving the game away in her caption, Olivia told fans alongside her costume snaps: \u2018Being Barbie really was the BEST DAY EVER. LIVING for this Halloween look @annalingis created on me for the @barbiestyle 60th anniversary\u2026 #HalloweenBarbie.\u2019\n\nJust wow.\n\nOlivia, meanwhile, recently celebrated her first wedding anniversary with husband Alex Bowen.\n\nThe two met on Love Island three years ago and since have moved in together, tied the knot and raise two dogs.\n\nOlivia is married to Love Island co-star Alex Bowen (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nTo celebrate their milestone, Alex proved he is ever the romantic and brought Olivia back to their wedding venue \u2013 renting out the entire place for just the two of them, for one night only.\n\nSince their wedding, the couple have often been asked about having children and Olivia admits the constant questions about getting pregnant have been off-putting.\n\n\u2018When everyone asks me and tells me I\u2019m like no I don\u2019t want to and it just felt like a big pressure,\u2019 she revealed on The Reality Tea podcast.\n\n\u2018But actually we\u2019ve been together nearly three and a half years now and I\u2019m starting to come round to the idea, I\u2019m getting slightly more broody but it\u2019s taken a while.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlivia and Alex got engaged in 2017 before getting married in September 2018 in Essex.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
