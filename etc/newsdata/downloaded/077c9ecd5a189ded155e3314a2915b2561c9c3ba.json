The shelves are either empty or filled up with expensive brand alternatives.\u201d\n\nSome have claimed people are stockpiling the drug with Brexit looming.\n\nDisappointed customer Scott Reid complained: \"No generic ibuprofen in local Tesco or Aldi for three weeks now and no date as to when supplies will resume. Normally thousands of packs. Clearly somebody somewhere is stockpiling...\"\n\nA spokesman for Sainsbury's told MirrorOnline: \u201cSome stores are running low on some own brand ibuprofen and paracetamol lines. We\u2019re working to replenish as quickly as possible and are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\u201d\n\nIt comes after the British Medical Association, called for \"urgent action\" over shortages of a host of common medicines, caused by manufacturing problems.", "description": "Customers needing painkillers have found major retailers like Tesco, Sainsbury's, Boots and Superdrug hit by 'supply issue'", "authors": ["Mark Chandler", "Image", "Alamy Stock Photo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465173.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Two-packets-of-16-Sainsburys-ibuprofen-200mg-caplets.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
