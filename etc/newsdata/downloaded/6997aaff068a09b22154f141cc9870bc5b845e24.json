We [need] moments where we just are,\" said Voysey.\n\nSheridan Voysey is a writer, columnist and podcaster based in the United Kingdom. (Blake Wisz)\n\n\"Yes, we are workers, but actually we are also people who play and we are people who befriend others and we do service in the community and we enjoy art.\"\n\nIf the weekend as a whole is directed toward recovery from work, Voysey argued, than it devalues those other activities. He said that in the back of his mind during his free time, he would find himself analysing if this was the best possible use of his time, or if he could be more productive.\n\nWork as secondary identity\n\nIt was one of the reasons he disliked watching television \u2014 it consumed his time but didn't seem to add any material value to his existence. This led to disagreements with his wife over what to watch, and whether it was worth their time.\n\n\"She's the one who's watching Big Bang Theory and I'm kind of saying 'well hang on, there's got to be something more educational that we can watch'\" said Voysey.\n\nHe's since let go of that productive impulse. He said it shouldn't matter whether all of your time is productive; sometimes it's okay to relax without thinking how it will serve you later.\n\nTo avoid that hyper-productive way of thinking, Voysey added he now starts every day with 10 minutes of silence and reflection. As a Christian, that time is about communicating with God \u2014 but it's also about slowing down and putting work in its place.\n\n\"I am a child of God. That is my first and primary identity. And \u2026 if I can really go deep into that \u2014find my deepest sense of meaning, purpose, significance and security\u2014 then work can actually fall into its secondary place,\" he said.", "description": "Do you ever find yourself judging the weekend by the extent to which it recharges you for the working week?
