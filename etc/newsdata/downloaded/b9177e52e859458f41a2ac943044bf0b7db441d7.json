She said she\u2019ll \u2018be doing death metal only\u2019 from now on.", "language": "en", "text": "caption Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg during the Climate Action Summit. source Carlo Allegri/Reuters\n\nGreta Thunberg\u2019s speech at the UN Climate Action Summit was pretty hardcore, and a video that went viral over the weekend has since given it a fitting soundtrack.\n\nThe 16-year-old Swedish activist kicked off the summit with an impassioned and emotional speech to the UN General Assembly in which she chastised world leaders for failing to take action to slow the effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cThis is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\u201d Thunberg said with tears in her eyes. \u201cYet you all come to me for hope? How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\nWhen the New York City-based thrash-metal drummer John Meredith heard Thunberg\u2019s words, he knew exactly what he wanted to do.\n\n\u201cI was very impressed by her passion and outrage,\u201d Meredith, who calls himself John Mollusk online and performs in a band called Suaka, told Rolling Stone. \u201cAnd the words she chose just evoked the darkness of the metal music I love: Entombed, Gojira, At the Gates, Sepultura.\u201d\n\nMeredith improvised some death-metal instrumentals to accompany Thunberg\u2019s speech, according to Rolling Stone. Since her voice didn\u2019t sound \u201cmetal enough,\u201d he sang along in his own growl.\n\nThe resulting video, which Meredith posted on YouTube on September 25, has been viewed over 3.1 million times.\n\n\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t really have a specific intent other than to turn her brutal words into a metal song,\u201d Meredith told Rolling Stone.\n\nHe acknowledged that the music added humor to a speech about a serious and urgent topic.\n\n\u201cTeen angst can be a powerful and important driving force in society, for instance the Arab spring,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is an element of satire and levity regarding the tone and the music. I mean, I have never sung like that before in my life. I think humor and [positive mental attitude] can be at least as powerful as anger and outrage, and there is a place for both.\u201d\n\nThunberg seemed to accept the humorous take on her speech and weighed in on the video in a Twitter post: \u201cI have moved on from this climate thing\u2026 From now on I will be doing death metal only!!\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhile Thunberg was, of course, joking about that career change, Meredith\u2019s video is really leading him to pursue some new projects.\n\n\u201cEven before the video went viral, my friends were suggesting other speeches to do,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cI had so much fun doing this one, I will probably do more.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Thunberg's \"How dare you?\" speech chastising world leaders sounds even more intense with an original musical backdrop..
