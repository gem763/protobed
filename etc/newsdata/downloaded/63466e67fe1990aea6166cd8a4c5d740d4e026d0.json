Robert Maginnis, a frequent analyst on TV and radio, said the U.S. needs to reset resources.\n\n\u201cWe have spent almost two decades in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and North Africa chasing terrorists,\u201d he told The Washington Times, referring to the post-9/11 priorities against Islamic extremists. \u201cThose fights will continue with or without our full support. We must minimize that drain in order to refocus on what\u2019s most important, which is deterring China and Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese \u201care rapidly [matching] and in some areas exceeding U.S. military capabilities, and based on [President Xi Jinping\u2019s] rhetoric, the Asian giant intends to make his nation the world\u2019s military hegemony by the regime\u2019s 100th anniversary\u201d in 2049.\n\nU.S. forces entered Syria under President Obama in 2014 to liberate towns in northeastern Syria. There the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist army had swelled to the point that it was strong enough to invade Iraq, capitalizing on Mr. Obama\u2019s 2011 decision to pull all U.S. forces from that country.\n\nIn Syria, Kurdish and Arab forces, supported by American special operations forces and air power, systematically rid each area of ISIS fighters. Mr. Trump declared the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate destroyed in February.\n\nBut over the weekend, as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he planned to invade, Mr. Trump ordered the first segment of American troops to leave an area near the Turkish border and later announced that all 1,000 U.S. special operations forces inside Syria would be coming home.\n\nWith that, Mr. Erdogan unleashed an offensive to cleanse a corridor of Kurdish factions he says are linked to Kurdish separatists inside Turkey and thus a threat to his government.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal has been roundly criticized by Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. They say the U.S. betrayed its Kurdish allies, who had proved so critical in the fight against Islamic extremists. More than 11,000 Kurdish fighters are estimated to have died in the campaign to oust the Islamic State.\n\nBut many of Mr. Trump\u2019s base supporters are standing by him, saying the president is doing what he promised as a candidate three years ago.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s actions on Syria are generally consistent with his campaign positions. He wanted to crush ISIS and get out,\u201d said J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon spokesman and Trump campaign national security adviser.\n\n\u201cWhile the clash between our Turkish and Kurdish allies is obviously terrible, armed conflict between them has been going on for decades,\u201d Mr. Gordon, an analyst on One America News network, said in an interview Monday. \u201cSince we are $22 trillion in debt and rising, we should not be the world\u2019s policeman forever. If there is any border that must be a priority to defend, it\u2019s our own.\u201d\n\nRetired Navy Capt. Chuck Nash also endorsed the Syria withdrawal.\n\n\u201cWhere is the ISIS caliphate now? It\u2019s gone,\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cNow that that is done, why are we there?\u201d\n\nCapt. Nash said Turkey eventually may fall into a trap by riling millions of Kurds in the region.\n\n\u201cAs these forces realign \u2026 you\u2019re going to have a much broader, more potent force facing the Turks and the massive Kurdish population inside their borders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have bit off a lot, and this could blow up in their face.\u201d\n\nBuck Sexton, a former CIA analyst and a Trump defender on social media and TV, tweeted his support Monday.\n\n\u201cAround 500,000 human beings were killed in Syria while Barack Obama was president and leading for a \u2018political settlement\u2019 to that civil war,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMedia has been more outraged in the last 72 hours over our Syria policy than they were at any point during 7 years of slaughter. Ask why.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
