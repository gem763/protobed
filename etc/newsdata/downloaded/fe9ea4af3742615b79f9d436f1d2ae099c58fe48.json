That day came Tuesday in her native Belgium, her death confirmed in a statement from the city of Diest.\n\nVervoort, who was 40, won gold and silver medals in wheelchair racing at the 2012 London Paralympics, and two more medals three years ago in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn an interview attended by The Associated Press at the Paralympics in Rio, Vervoort described living with unbroken pain from an incurable, degenerative spinal disease. She talked of sleeping only 10 minutes some nights, described severe pain that caused others to pass out just watching her, and detailed how sports kept her alive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too hard for my body,\u201d Vervoort said in the 2016 interview. \u201cEach training I\u2019m suffering because of pain. Every race I train hard. Training and riding and doing competition are medicine for me. I push so hard \u2014 to push literally all my fear and everything away.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Her death touches us deeply,\u201d the family said in a statement.\n\nVervoort was a strong advocate of the right to choose euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium. Like training hard, she said it gave her control and put \u201cmy own life in my hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really scared, but those (euthanasia) papers give me a lot of peace of mind because I know when it\u2019s enough for me, I have those papers,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have those papers, I think I\u2019d have done suicide already. I think there will be fewer suicides when every country has the law of euthanasia. \u2026 I hope everybody sees that this is not murder, but it makes people live longer.\u201d\n\nVervoort also suffered from epileptic seizures, and had one in 2014 when she was cooking pasta and spilled boiling water over her legs. That resulted in a four-month hospital stay.\n\nA loyal Labrador named Zenn began staying with her, pawing her when a seizure was about to occur. \u201cWhen I\u2019m going to have an epileptic attack, she warns me one hour before,\u201d Vervoort said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she feels it.\u201d\n\nZenn also pulled her socks out of the sock drawer, Vervoort said, and helped her carry groceries home when she bought too much.\n\nVervoort said she kept pushing back the day of her death, knowing it could come anytime \u2014 as it can for anyone. She said she can be pain-free one minute, and nearly pass out a few minutes later. \u201cYou have to live day-by-day and enjoy the little moments,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody tomorrow can have a car accident and die, or a heart attack and die. It can be tomorrow for everybody.\u201d\n\nVervoort called herself a \u201ccrazy lady.\u201d\n\nShe talked of flying in an F-16 fighter jet, riding in a rally car, and curating a museum of her life going back to at least 14 when she was diagnosed with her rare illness.\n\nShe said she wanted to be remembered as the lady who was \u201calways laughing, always smiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel different about death now than years ago,\u201d Vervoort said. \u201cFor me I think death is something like they operate on you, you go to sleep and you never wake up. For me it\u2019s something peaceful.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Vervoort won medals in wheelchair racing at the 2012 and 2016 Paralympics.
