Mallard is a father of three, so he was a natural and fed the baby a bottle during the debate.\n\nNormally the Speaker\u2019s chair is only used by Presiding Officers but today a VIP took the chair with me. Congratulations @tamaticoffey and Tim on the newest member of your family. pic.twitter.com/47ViKHsKkA \u2014 Trevor Mallard (@SpeakerTrevor) August 21, 2019\n\nCoffey had just returned from paternity leave after his son, with partner Tim Smith, was born in July. This was the first time Coffey brought his son to a parliamentary debate. The baby was born via surrogate and is biologically Smith's.\n\nThe photo of Mallard holding the baby boy went viral. In an interview with New Zealand's Newshub, Coffey said he felt \"really supported by my colleagues from across the House.\" He is not the first politician from the country to bring his baby to work.\n\nLovely to have a baby in the House, and what a beautiful one @tamaticoffey pic.twitter.com/EP6iP9eQES \u2014 Gareth Hughes (@GarethMP) August 21, 2019\n\nIn 2017, Australian Senator Larissa Waters breastfed her baby in parliament. And British politician Jo Swinson attended a debate with her baby in 2018.\n\nNew Zealand's own Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also made history by bringing her baby to her United Nations speech in New York. Ardern was just the second world leader to give birth while in office.", "description": "The speaker held the baby for his colleague, who had just come back from paternity leave after welcoming his son's birth", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/22/5c14eb5b-a727-4b6d-8d37-729709d41b9d/thumbnail/1200x630/4325d79f2bec56b0079cad27efa64f7c/ecdzidpwsaavfsd.jpg"}
