He wants to designate Brazil as a major non-NATO ally. O\u2019Brien has a similar view.\n\n\u201cNATO is the most successful military alliance in history. Under American leadership, our NATO allies must be encouraged to invest in their own defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also time to consider a global freedom alliance for those tried and true countries that ascribe to the rule of law and are willing to fight to defend freedom... In addition to current NATO members, candidates for such an alliance include, among others, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, Singapore, Israel, the Philippines and, potentially, India as it sheds its non-aligned ideology and moves away from its weapons purchasing relationship with Russia.\u201d\n\nNOT A FAN OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n\nWhen Bolton was U.S. ambassador to the U.N., O\u2019Brien worked with him, and shares his disdain for the institution - which holds its annual general assembly meeting next week in New York.\n\n\u201cMy thirteen-year-old son, who is far more interested in sports than politics, walked into the family room yesterday and said: \u2018Dad, I saw on the news that the thing is starting when all the dictators come to America and give speeches about how bad we are.\u2019 His statement is one of the better descriptions of the United Nations General Assembly that I have ever heard.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters with U.S. hostage negotiator Robert O'Brien after he named O'Brien as his fourth White House national security adviser at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nISLAMIC EXTREMISTS AND MIGRATION\n\nLike Trump, O\u2019Brien sees Islamic extremist groups and migration as a threat, and decried \u201ca lack of political will to commit sufficient armed forces to defeat the Islamic State, or to confront and deter Iran\u201d in his book.\n\n\u201cPeak political correctness in the West prevents governments from even identifying, much less fighting, an ideological war against the jihadists.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, millions of migrants, primarily military-aged young men from North Africa and the Middle East, stream into Europe - a circumstance that will change the security environment, culture, and demography of the continent forever.\u201d\n\nIRAN HAWK\n\nO\u2019Brien was a critic of the Iran nuclear deal, and sees Iran\u2019s nuclear program as a major threat.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world and is building an archipelago across the Middle East using proxies and Revolutionary Guard forces from Yemen to Syria to Lebanon.\u201d\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\nTrump wants to reduce U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan. O\u2019Brien, who has worked to train Afghan women as judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers, has emphasized the need to focus on corruption and rule of law.\n\n\u201cWe engage in justice sector reform efforts because it is the right thing to do - but also because it is in our national interest. The spread of freedom and the rule of law are our best defense against tyranny and war.\u201d\n\nMORE ENGAGEMENT IN AFRICA\n\nTrump\u2019s Africa strategy - launched by Bolton last year - seeks to bolster business and security ties with the continent to counter China. O\u2019Brien, who spent a year as an undergrad at South Africa\u2019s University of the Free State and says he is proficient in Afrikaans, shares this view.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump talks to the news media with his newly announced White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien after the president named O'Brien as his fourth national security adviser at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\n\u201cTo stem the Chinese tide and to give Africans the opportunity to have a better future, the United States must strongly advocate for human rights, democracy, and freedom on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther, the Africom (headquarters) needs to move from Frankfurt to Africa. The HQ would immediately provide the host country with an economic boost.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump named Robert O'Brien on Wednesday as his latest White House national security adviser, picking a lawyer who has worked to secure the release of hostages to replace John Bolton, with whom Trump parted acrimoniously.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431341971&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1Q9", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
