Police have three suspects in custody and are searching for two more. One of those in custody is also 14.\n\n\"When I look at this \u2026 it's a complete disregard for human life, which is extremely concerning for people of such a young age,\" said Det.-Sgt. Steve Bereziuk, in a news conference Monday evening.\n\nPolice responded around 1:45 p.m. to what was originally described as a \"serious assault,\" and put Winston Churchill and four other area schools under lockdown. Less than two hours later, Hamilton police announced that the student had died.\n\nThe community is in shock, and \"our hearts are broken,\" said Manny Figueiredo, director of education at the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board, in a statement Monday evening.\n\n\"Our entire community shares in the grief and sadness of having lost a valued and loved student,\" he said.\n\nSchool principal Marco Barzetti sent a letter home saying the school would have support staff on hand Tuesday to assist students. He encouraged any who were struggling with the tragedy to speak him or their teacher. He said flags would be lowered for three days.\n\nResidents in the area of the school witnessed parts of what transpired and the aftermath.\n\nAlice Smith, who has lived just down the road from the school for the past 14 years, said she was sitting in her front sunroom with her husband on Monday afternoon when five teens came around the corner, with a car following close behind.\n\nSmith said it appeared to her the woman in the car was trying to help the boy.\n\n\"She said she tried to save him, but she just couldn't do it,\" Smith said. \"She was very upset. She couldn't stop crying.\"\n\nSmith said crowds of students pass by her house each day on their way to grab lunch at nearby stores and restaurants. She said she hopes if any of them are ever afraid or in trouble, they'll knock on her door and ask for help.\n\n\"This should not be happening. Kids should feel safe to go to school,\" she said, her voice breaking. \"Now we have a young boy that's dead and that really upset me.\"\n\nKandace Brenn, who also lives in the area, said she knew the victim and he had been a visitor to her house. She described him as a \"sweet, quiet kid\" who kept to himself.\n\n.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HamiltonPolice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@HamiltonPolice</a> say a 14-year-old male student from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Churchill_HWDSB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Churchill_HWDSB</a> has died as a result of injuries after an assault outside the school in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HamOnt?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HamOnt</a>.

The niece wanted Brenn to drive her and her best friend to the Hamilton General Hospital emergency room, where the victim had been taken. Both girls are students at the high school, and her niece's friend was the victim's girlfriend said Brenn.\n\n\"As soon as I got to them, I just started breaking down, 'cause I knew it was bad, the look on their faces. She couldn't even breathe.\"\n\nIn the car on the way to the hospital, she said the friend described finding the victim unconscious and bleeding.

The school is just north of Main Street East, near the Queenston traffic circle, in Hamilton's east end.\n\nWhen students streamed out of the school after the hold-and-secure was lifted, they found several blocks behind the building, between Adeline and Walter Avenues, taped off and a heavy police presence. Some kids asked police how they could reach their parents, with officers turning them around and telling them they'd need to find another way through.\n\nBehind the school, where Ivon Avenue ends at Dunsmere Road, a pair of medical packs could be seen sitting on the grass with a student's backpack lying a few metres away.", "description": "A 14-year-old Hamilton student was fatally stabbed, while his mother was with him, outside Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School on\u00a0Monday, police said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312287.1570476428!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/winston-churchill-high-school-assault-hamilton.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
