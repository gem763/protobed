Scarano was hired by the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nPagourtzis\u2018 defense team and a court-ordered independent psychologist, Karen Gollaher, have already finished their evaluations of the teen.\n\nPagourtzis\u2018 attorney Nick Poehl declined to comment, citing a gag order issued Tuesday.\n\nPoehl argued in August that Pagourtzis\u2018 mental health had deteriorated since his arrest and that he had no understanding of the legal proceedings.\n\nNo competency hearing has been ordered. The next pre-trial conference is scheduled for December.\n\nThe trial scheduled for next year has been moved to Fort Bend County, 45 miles (70 kilometers) from Galveston County \u2014 where the attack happened \u2014 because of intense publicity.\n\nCourt records show Pagourtzis also faces federal charges.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Galveston County Daily News, http://www.galvnews.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A judge has ordered a third psychiatric examination of a teenager charged in a mass shooting at a Texas high school last year to help determine whether the former student is mentally competent to stand trial.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/school_shooting_texas_60595_c0-0-2800-1633_s1200x700.jpg?5a94112b7850b5f398aa8427dc01c7bb41c68690", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
