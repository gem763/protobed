You might want to begin with Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Admiral (VBTLX). While this fund is not tracked by the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, we were able to examine other factors like performance, volatility, and cost.\n\nHistory of Fund/Manager\n\nVanguard Group is based in Malvern, PA, and is the manager of VBTLX. Since Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Admiral made its debut in November of 2001, VBTLX has garnered more than $105.74 billion in assets. The fund is currently managed by Joshua C. Barrickman who has been in charge of the fund since February of 2013.\n\nPerformance\n\nOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 3.32%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 3.06%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.\n\nWhen looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of VBTLX over the past three years is 3.35% compared to the category average of 9.14%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 3.18% compared to the category average of 9.48%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nIt's always important to be aware of the downsides to any future investment, so one should not discount the risks that come with this segment. In VBTLX's case, the fund gained 6.21% in the most recent bear market and outperformed its peer group by 49%. This could mean that the fund is a better choice than comparable funds during a bear market.\n\nNevertheless, investors should also note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.04, which means it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the . VBTLX's 5-year performance has produced a negative alpha of -0.12, which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.\n\nExpenses\n\nAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, VBTLX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.05% compared to the category average of 0.86%. VBTLX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.\n\nWhile the minimum initial investment for the product is $3,000, investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $1.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFor additional information on this product, or to compare it to other mutual funds in the Index, make sure to go to www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds for additional information.
