(AP) \u2014 A Coast Guard lieutenant accused of stockpiling weapons and targeting Supreme Court justices, prominent Democrats and TV journalists pleaded guilty on Thursday to gun and drug charges.\n\nChristopher Hasson\u2019s guilty plea to all four of the counts he faced resolves a case in which federal prosecutors called him a self-described white nationalist and domestic terrorist intent on carrying out mass killings.\n\nBut prosecutors didn\u2019t file any terrorism-related charges against Hasson, who was arrested in February. With his plea, he now faces up to 31 years in prison. His sentencing is set for Jan. 31.\n\nTwo of the four counts in Hasson\u2019s indictment charged him with illegally possessing unregistered and unserialized silencers. He also was charged with possession of a firearm by an unlawful user or addict of a controlled substance, and illegal possession of tramadol, an opioid painkiller.\n\nProsecutors claimed Hasson drew up what appeared to be a computer spreadsheet hit list that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer and Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Cory A. Booker and Kamala D. Harris. Several network TV journalists \u2014 MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo and Van Jones \u2014 also were mentioned.\n\nHasson also targeted two Supreme Court justices and two social media company executives and searched online for their home addresses in March 2018, within minutes of searching firearm sales websites, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn a February court filing, prosecutors said Hasson \u201cintends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.\u201d They also said he has espoused extremist views for years and drafted an email in which he said he was \u201cdreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth.\u201d\n\nIn a 2017 letter he sent to himself as a draft and apparently wrote to a neo-Nazi leader, Hasson identified himself as a white nationalist for over 30 years and \u201cadvocated for \u2018focused violence\u2019 in order to establish a white homeland,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nInvestigators found 15 guns, including seven rifles, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition at Hasson\u2019s basement apartment in Silver Spring, Maryland. He researched how to make homemade bombs and mortars, studied sniper training and used his government computer to search for information about Nazis and Adolf Hitler, prosecutors said.\n\nLast month, a federal judge refused to dismiss the gun charges against Hasson, who has been held in custody since his arrest. U.S. District Judge George Hazel rejected defense attorneys\u2019 argument that charging Hasson with unlawful possession of firearm silencers violates his Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n\nProsecutors have said Hasson appeared to be planning attacks inspired by the manifesto of Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in a 2011 bomb-and-shooting rampage.\n\nAssistant federal public defender Liz Oyer has said prosecutors found no evidence to back up terrorism allegations. She accused them of seeking to punish Hasson for \u201cprivate thoughts\u201d he never shared.\n\nIn a court filing last week, Hasson\u2019s lawyers asked the judge to bar prosecutors from presenting any trial evidence linking him to white nationalist views or associations or \u201cany plans or preparations he allegedly made to commit an act of violence or terrorism.\u201d\n\nHasson, a former Marine, worked at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington on a program to acquire advanced new cutters for the agency. He has remained on active duty pending the outcome of the criminal case.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Coast Guard lieutenant accused of stockpiling weapons and targeting Supreme Court justices, prominent Democrats and TV journalists pleaded guilty on Thursday to gun and drug charges.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/coast_guard_lieutenant_hit_list_06755_c0-0-3590-2093_s1770x1032.jpg?d4798c8b1c5271153691aa1ab52521bb1f145161"}
