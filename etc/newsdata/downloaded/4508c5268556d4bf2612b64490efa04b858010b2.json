Those rates go up to 62% and 49%, respectively, in high-income countries.\n\nUnicef say that 10 times more girls and 12 times more boys between five and 19 are obese today than in 1975.\n\nHenrietta Fore, Unicef\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cDespite all the technological, cultural and social advances of the last few decades, we have lost sight of this most basic fact: If children eat poorly, they live poorly.\n\n\u201cMillions of children subsist on an unhealthy diet because they simply do not have a better choice.\u201d\n\nUnicef says it wants to see \u201cproven legislation\u201d, such as sugar taxes, to reduce demand for unhealthy foods, as well as incentivising food suppliers to provide healthy, affordable foods.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care Spokesperson said: \u201cAs this report points out, we have already taken action to help families make healthier choices.\n\n\u201cOur world leading childhood obesity programme includes measures that will make a difference to everyone \u2013 the soft drinks industry levy has already seen the sugar content of subjected drinks decrease by 28.8% and has funded school sports across the country.\n\n\u201cOur prevention green paper has also set out a series of new measures, including consulting on ways to implement clearer labelling on products.\u2019\u2019", "description": "A global Unicef report says one in three school-leavers are overweight or obese in the UK, with children from poor areas twice as likely to be obese.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/wire-19715250-1571094330-601_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
