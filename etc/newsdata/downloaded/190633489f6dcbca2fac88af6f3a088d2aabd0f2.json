These SIM cards can be bought on eBay and plugged into a burner phone. Once the phone number is transferred, the hacker can reset passwords for valuable and private services like cryptocurrency wallets and email accounts. Samy Tarazi, a sergeant at the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s office said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about kids aged mainly between 19 and 22 being able to steal millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies [...] we\u2019re now dealing with someone who buys a 99 cent SIM card off eBay, plugs it into a cheap burner phone, makes a call and steals millions of dollars. That\u2019s pretty remarkable.\u201d\n\nAccording to Terpin, more than 50 victims of SIM swapping have reached out to him, all having suffered significant financial losses. Terpin hopes to meet Ajit Pai during the Mobile World Congress Americas in Los Angeles, where both men are invited to speak.\n\nTerpin vs. AT&T\n\nIn 2018, Terpin filed a $224 million lawsuit against wireless service giant AT&T, convinced that the telecoms company had provided hackers with access to his phone number. In late July 2019, a judge dismissed the suit, stating that Terpin \u201cfails to sufficiently allege proximate cause. Mr. Terpin does not connect how granting the hackers/fraudsters access to Mr. Terpin\u2019s phone number resulted in him losing $24 million.\u201d\n\nIn May, Terpin won a civil case against Nicholas Truglia, the alleged hacker who actually perpetrated the SIM swap and subsequent crypto theft. The California Superior Court ordered Truglia to pay over $75 million in compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nMore recently, a California resident Seth Shapiro filed a lawsuit against AT&T for the same reasons, alleging that its employees helped to perpetrate a SIM-swap which resulted in the theft of over $1.8 million in total, including cryptocurrencies.", "description": "SIM swapping victim Michael Terpin wrote an open letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to take action against this type of fraud", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kMDJmZjE3ZjExMTk4NTlkYmExMDI2YzgzODcxYjMyNy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
