There were too many people working on him.\"\n\nHis wife Charlotte also spoke of their sadness at not being able to donate his organs.\n\n\"There wasn\u2019t anything that wasn\u2019t broken either inside or out,\" she said, reliving the moment doctors explained the 19-year-old's body was too badly damaged.\n\n\"We were only left with tissue donation. I believe that\u2019s the retinas of his eyes and the skin that wasn\u2019t touched.\"\n\nCharlotte says she has had no communication from Sacoolas, while Harry's father spoke of how difficult the ordeal has been.\n\nTim described the despair as so awful that it felt like his brain wanted to \"explode\".\n\nEarlier this week Trump waded into the international diplomatic immunity row and was condemned for his clumsy analysis of Harry\u2019s death.\n\nBut in a follow up press conference the US leader softened his stance, revealing Sacoolas was \u201cbeing spoken to\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re trying to work something out.\u201d\n\nLawyer Radd Seiger, who is representing the family, is understood to have arrived in Washington DC on Thursday night for talks.\n\nHe said: \u201cBringing her back to Britain is our priority.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson suggested that it was unlikely.\n\nHe said: \u201cAmerica is reluctant to allow its nationals to be tried overseas. We\u2019ve got to keep working to get justice for Harry.\u201d", "description": "Harry Dunn's heartbroken father Tim, 50, says he wasn't allowed near his dying son to hold his hand one final time", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20547437.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Parents-Of-Harry-Dunn-Brief-Media-After-Meeting-Foreign-Secretary-Raab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
