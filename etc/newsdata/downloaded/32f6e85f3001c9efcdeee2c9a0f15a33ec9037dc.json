Our BBC\u201d, and: \u201cBBC, can\u2019t you see, this is an emergency\u201d.\n\nPolice officers stood between the dozens of demonstrators and the entrance. Several appeared to be glued to the ground near the doors.\n\nThe group called on the BBC \u201cto meet its crucial moral duty to tell the full truth on the climate and ecological emergency\u201d.\n\nQ&A What are Extinction Rebellion's key demands? Show Hide The UK group of Extinction Rebellion has three core demands: 1) Tell the truth\n\nThe government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, \u201cworking with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change\u201d. 2) Net zero emissions by 2025\n\nThe UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025. 3) Citizens\u2019 assembly\n\nThe government must create a citizens\u2019 assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. Citizens\u2019 assemblies bring together ordinary people to investigate, discuss and make recommendations on how to respond, in this case, to the ecological emergency. In the US activists have added a further demand: \u201cA just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.\u201d Matthew Taylor\n\nOver a tannoy, Extinction Rebellion activists broadcast a number of mock bulletins in the style of those that could be aired if the UK was flooded.\n\n\u201cMake your food stocks last, ration your supply,\u201d a man warned, before a siren rang out. \u201cWith immediate effect \u2026 martial law has been declared. The strategic climate defence committee has suspended all transport until further notice.\u201d\n\nBBC staff reported being unable to enter the building, and the financial journalist Paul Lewis tweeted that Extinction Rebellion had locked him out of the BBC.\n\nA BBC spokeswoman told Reuters she could not comment on security matters.\n\nOn Thursday, a protester climbed on top of a plane at London City airport. Extinction Rebellion is using two weeks of civil disobedience to pressure governments to do more to combat greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPlay Video 2:19 Activist climbs plane as Extinction Rebellion takes protest to London airport \u2013 video\n\nThe Metropolitan police have made more than 1,100 arrests since the protests began earlier this week.", "description": "Activists block entrance to headquarters of BBC, accusing it of staying silent on crisis", "authors": ["Mattha Busby", "Richard Vize"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7e6e99b34fc44585e7c8e16ad0ea3acb52d8b2e/79_415_3086_1851/master/3086.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9375928cf5e542aef0cb7209ae7484a7", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
