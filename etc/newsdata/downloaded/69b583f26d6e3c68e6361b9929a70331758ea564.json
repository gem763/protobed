They also visited Camp Morehead to meet with coalition troops and they spoke with Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was there on an announced visit of his own.\n\n\u201cOur delegation emphasized the central importance of combating the corruption which endangers security and undermines the Afghan people\u2019s ability to achieve a stable and prosperous future,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe underscored that the women of Afghanistan must be at the table for reconciliation talks.\u201d\n\nShe said the group also met with U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan John Bass and other diplomats to discuss reconciliation efforts with the Taliban, who have committed recent terrorist attacks in the country.\n\n\u201cWe will return to Washington strengthened with the facts and the first-hand knowledge we have gathered at this critical time for our nation\u2019s Afghanistan policy and inspired by the courage of our service members and diplomats on the front lines,\u201d she said.\n\nThe nine-member delegation, which consisted of eight Democrats and one Republican, Mac Thornberry of the House Armed Services Committee, made the Afghan trip after concluding a visit to Jordan.\n\nThe visit followed U.S. President Donald Trump in September calling off peace negotiations with the Taliban that would have seen a withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country. Trump has vowed to halt the United States\u2019 \u201cnever-ending wars,\u201d including its 18-year engagement in Afghanistan.\n\nPelosi\u2019s trip to Afghanistan overlapped with that of Esper, who was in the country to get a \u201creally good feel about what\u2019s happening on the ground in Afghanistan,\u201d he told reporters Saturday en route to the country.\n\nHe said the goal is still to ink a peace deal with the Taliban and to withdraw troops from the country.\n\n\u201cWe think a political agreement is always the best way forward with regard to next steps in Afghanistan,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nConcerning the withdrawal of troops, Esper said the United States could manage a reduction to 8,600 from the roughly 14,000 soldiers stationed in the country without affecting operations, while suggesting the drawdown should be a part of peace negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best to do these things as part and parcel of a broader political agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I think that also gives you greater confidence as you go do to [8,600], you can manage it in a much more efficient matter, a safer manner as you do the draw-down. So, that would be the principal reason why.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a Congressional delegation have concluded a previously unannounced trip to Afghanistan, her office", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
