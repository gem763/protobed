REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nIncreasing signs of slowing global demand have made Japanese central bankers less confident about an early pickup in global growth, making them more open to debate over easing policy.\n\nRunning short of ammunition to ease further, BOJ policymakers, however, want to keep their powder dry for as long as possible in case Japan\u2019s economy runs into greater trouble.\n\nWith markets calm for now, the BOJ is leaning towards keeping interest rates unchanged at the Sept. 18-19 meeting unless the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s decision - to be announced hours before the BOJ\u2019s - jolt markets and trigger an unwelcome yen spike.\n\n\u201cThe yen is weakening and stock prices are rising. Market conditions aren\u2019t worsening enough for the BOJ to ease now,\u201d said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.\n\nBut with global uncertainties heightening and the fallout from the bitter trade war broadening, it may be only a matter of time before the BOJ ramps up stimulus, analysts say.\n\nAn increasing number of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to loosen policy further this year, with well over a third of them betting it could act next week.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s so much uncertainty, additional easing could be required any time,\u201d a source familiar with the BOJ\u2019s thinking said, a view echoed by two other sources.\n\nUnder the policy, dubbed yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term rates towards -0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield to around 0%. It also buys government bonds and risky assets in a bid to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target.\n\nDeepening negative rates will be the key option if the BOJ were to ease, although the central bank may accompany that with measures to mitigate the pain on financial institutions, sources have told Reuters.\n\nEven if the BOJ decides to hold fire next week, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will likely stress the bank\u2019s readiness to ease swiftly to fend off shocks to the economy, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe ECB and the Fed are in deep easing mode. To prevent the yen from rising, the BOJ needs to keep alive market expectations that it, too, will ramp up stimulus fairly soon,\u201d said Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at Sony Financial Holdings.\n\nFLAT CURVE DILEMMA\n\nMarket expectations of imminent easing grew after the BOJ pledged in July to act pre-emptively \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d against risks that could knock the economy off the path toward achieving its 2% inflation target.\n\nWaiting until the subsequent meeting on Oct. 30-31 will allow BOJ policymakers time to scrutinize the bank\u2019s \u201ctankan\u201d business sentiment survey for clues on how much the pain Japan is suffering from the U.S.-China trade war. Policymakers can also see the initial consumer reaction to a sales tax hike that kicks off in October.\n\nThe BoJ is under no political pressure for imminent action.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday it was up to the BOJ to make monetary policy decisions, adding that Japan\u2019s economic fundamentals remained solid.\n\nAnother problem the BOJ board could discuss next week is the persistent decline in long-term rates that threaten the bank\u2019s policy aimed at controlling the yield curve.\n\nThe YCC policy was introduced partly to prevent the yield curve from flattening too much, as excessive declines in long- and super long yields will erode profit margins of financial institutions.\n\nBut downward pressure on global long-term rates pushed Japan\u2019s 10-year yield to -0.295% last month, well below the -0.2% level seen by markets as the BOJ\u2019s line in the sand. The 20-year yield briefly hit to 0.015%, barely staying above zero.\n\nSources have told Reuters the BOJ likely won\u2019t tolerate the 10-year yield from sliding below -0.3%, as that could push the 20-year yield below zero and flatten the yield curve.\n\nThe BOJ may eventually need to coordinate with the Ministry of Finance, which issues public debt, to control the supply of bonds to steepen the yield curve, Daiwa\u2019s Iwashita said.\n\n\u201cThe BOJ may keep trying to prevent super-long yields from falling by reducing bond buying. But there\u2019s a limit to what it can do alone,\u201d she said.", "description": "Stable markets and resilient domestic demand could help the Bank of Japan withstand pressure to expand an already massive stimulus program when policymakers meet next week in the wake of the European Central Bank's monetary loosening.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429347321&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0HH", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
