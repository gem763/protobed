It\u2019s the only way for Scherzer to prove to the team and himself he\u2019s back to his Cy Young-caliber self, the only way to show he\u2019s here to stay. The Nationals are depending on him to make this leap, because this week they tweaked their rotation to start him in Friday\u2019s series opener against the Braves. This decision was not only important for Scherzer to display his progress against a potent lineup but also to line him up for later.\n\nThe schedule now puts him as the starter on regular rest for a potentially important season finale at home against the Cleveland Indians \u2014 or it could give him two extra days rest before the National League wild-card game on Oct. 1.\n\nThe question now is not the durability. Scherzer said last week against the New York Mets he felt good adding to his workload, despite one bumpy inning, and last Sunday against the Braves he felt great at \u201cfull-throttle,\u201d a phrase of which he\u2019s fond.\n\n\u201cI was even ready to pitch the seventh inning,\u201d he added after the Braves game. \u201cReally thought I had 110 pitches today.\u201d\n\nBut the Nationals, in a winner-take-all game, don\u2019t need length as much as they usually might. They can dip into the bullpen early and often, and that includes fellow starters, if necessary. What they need is Scherzer\u2019s best stuff.\n\nMax Scherzer looks more like Max Scherzer as Nationals pound Braves, 9-4\n\nThe veteran right-hander dominates when he throws his mid- to high-90s fastball, a mid-80s slider that falls out of the zone and a mid-80s change-up that bears enough resemblance to a fastball to get some swings-and-misses but also stays mostly out of the strike zone as to not let batters who recognize it inflict too much damage. He complements these with the occasional low-90s cutter and high-70s curveball. Those velocities are one thing, and he\u2019s hit them consistently since his return, but it\u2019s movement that he\u2019s concerned about.\n\nHe measures progress in fastball life and spin rates, which are measured in revolutions per minute and primarily track how much a pitch moves and changes trajectory. Scherzer didn\u2019t love the shape of his pitches as he traversed the comeback trail, but he understood that it\u2019d take time regain them. His initial outings showed the rust as the fastball wasn\u2019t as lively as normal and the rotation on each pitch type varied almost each time he threw them.\n\nLast Sunday against the Braves pointed upward. The fastball life showed signs of stirring, including on a 98-mph ball to Ronald Acuna Jr. in the third inning, and the spin rates reflected Scherzer\u2019s apparently increased nastiness on the mound. His slider and cutter moved more consistently, and his curveball must\u2019ve looked to hitters as though it were flying down a roller-coaster. The ball revolved as much as it had in June, one of the best months of his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated it took this long,\u201d Scherzer said of his progress after last Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting this to happen a lot quicker than the way it has been and [have been] doing everything to make it happen.\u201d\n\nFacing an offense as difficult as the Braves for the second time in as many starts provides a formidable, as well as useful, proving ground. Atlanta has scored the sixth-most runs in baseball this season behind the sixth-best team on-base-plus-slugging-percentage (.794). They feature a dangerous, do-it-all leadoff hitter (Acuna Jr.), a fearsome, middle-of-the-order left-handed bat (Freddie Freeman) and flexibility to, for the most part, mix left- and right-handed hitters through the order. Their depth is such that even the No. 8 hitter (Dansby Swanson) has a .253 batting average and 17 home runs.\n\nScherzer seems up for the task. His stamina is there and his stuff looks as though it\u2019s shaping up. But he needs to prove, as he did in rehab with his back, that he can sustain this progress and that it\u2019s not a lingering issue. The Nationals and Scherzer need him to be at his best because, well, both their seasons might depend on it.\n\nRead more:\n\nFor some Marines, intramural softball championship at Nationals Park is \u2018like a dream come true\u2019\n\nStephen Strasburg and an effective bullpen help Nationals hold off Twins on Wednesday\n\nDave Martinez tearfully shares memories of being on field for first game in New York after 9/11\n\nDave Martinez has to walk a fine line with Nationals\u2019 late-season bullpen management\n\nNationals reliever Jonny Venters can\u2019t stay on the mound, but he can\u2019t walk away, either", "description": "The Nationals need their ace to show that the progress with his stuff is sustainable, because they\u2019re relying on him.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7ED3K3WO2UI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
