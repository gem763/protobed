A group of animals already in a rabbit rescue centre, so they are not likely to be the best cared for animals, to need to go into a rescue centre in the first place.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s probably not fair to put too much weight on the results. Having said that, we cannot deny we sometimes see ear infections in the big lop rabbits.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very unusual in the small lop rabbits, and very unusual in a healthy lop rabbit to get an ear problem. It\u2019s not an inevitable outcome of having lop ears.\n\n\u2018Certainly I\u2019ve had dwarf lop rabbits who have never had an ear problem in their life, and exhibitors I know who also keep dwarf lop and German lops have also not had that experience.\u2019", "description": "A study which examined 15 floppy rabbits and 15 erect eared bunnies found the lops 43 times more likely to have narrowed ear canals and 23 times more likely to have diseased incisor teeth.", "authors": ["Colin Fernandez Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/01/19182428-0-image-a-16_1569977067255.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
