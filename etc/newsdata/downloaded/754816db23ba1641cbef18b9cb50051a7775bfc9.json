He has nothing to lose at this point. In what world, though, did he think it was a good idea to pick a fight with Meghan McCain over gun ownership? Robert Francis is way out of his league.\n\nThe new season of ABC\u2019s The View began this week and right away Meghan McCain came under fire, so to speak, during a discussion about gun violence and mass shootings. The topic led to the inevitable back and forth on gun control. Meghan McCain was on her own. Fortunately, she\u2019s up to the task. Abby Huntsman, by the way, sounded like the liberal hosts on the subject. When the gun-grabbing part of the discussion began, McCain said in no uncertain terms that she isn\u2019t giving up her guns. Huntsman jumped on board with the liberal women who were blaming Republicans for not acting on gun control. McCain, an NRA member, spent time on her break from the show in Wyoming, shooting, among other activities. She specifically pointed to Beto\u2019s mandatory gun buyback program proposal as a non-starter for her.\n\nMoments later, McCain weighed in as the \u201cchick on the panel that spent most of her break shooting.\u201d Stating that there need to be more reporters in mainstream media on the \u201cgun beat\u201d because there are a lot of people on TV \u201ctalking about guns that clearly have never shot a gun,\u201d McCain complained about Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal for a mandatory gun buyback. \u201cI will say this is a ground-level issue for me,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a gun-grabber, you don\u2019t get my vote, period. We got to have a different conversation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not living without guns, it\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nMcCain used her trip to Wyoming to point out that people there, like in other gun-friendly areas of the country, would not willingly give up their guns. She went on to say it could lead to violence. Beto responded to Meghan\u2019s remarks as he waited his turn during CNN\u2019s 7 hours of climate change programming. He said her mentioning violence could be mistaken for her \u201cgiving permission\u201d for violence.\n\n\u201cI just I think that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful,\u201d the former congressman told The Daily Beast prior to joining a Wednesday marathon climate town hall on CNN. \u201cIt becomes self-fulfilling; you have people on TV who are almost giving you permission to be violent and saying, \u2018You know this is this is going to happen.\u2019\u201d O\u2019Rourke brought up McCain\u2019s name unprompted after \u201cThe View\u201d host had said, earlier this week, that an attempt by the government to compel AR-15 owners to sell back their weapons would prompt \u201ca lot of violence.\u201d \u201cWhen someone says, \u201cIf you do this, then this will happen,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, \u201calmost as though that\u2019s a natural response or maybe even something that should happen or deserves to happen. When I think the response should be, \u2018We\u2019re doing nothing now and we\u2019re seeing people slaughtered in their schools, at work, at a Walmart, in a synagogue, in a church, at a concert. There is violence right now and it is horrifying and it is terrifying and it is terrorizing.\u2019\u2026. We should be worried about that kind of violence right now.\u201d\n\nThis is the problem with gun-grabbing alarmists. They believe their own propaganda and when a reasonable person pushes back and stands up for Second Amendment rights, the alarmist has to go even more extreme in rhetoric. That is what Beto did. Instead of understanding that law-abiding gun owners are quite passionate about not willingly surrendering their firearms, he accused Meghan of inciting violence.\n\nMandatory gun buybacks for 20 million guns isn\u2019t a doable solution anyway. The government isn\u2019t entitled to buy something back from a consumer that the government never owned in the first place. That doesn\u2019t make any more sense than what the liberal women were saying on the show \u2013 that Americans have too many guns. How many are too many? Why should anyone be limited to the purchase of only one gun? The mass shooter in Lubbock used one rifle to kill and injure all those people.\n\nNew laws won\u2019t stop evil acts if a bad guy is determined enough to go through with acts of death and destruction. There may be loopholes that can be closed or tweaks to the background checks, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t claim to be a gun law expert. Piling on feel-good legislation just to \u201cdo something\u201d isn\u2019t the answer, though.\n\nMs. McCain gave the perfect response to Beto\u2019s crazy accusation against her. She scores extra points for the Texas reference.\n\nBeto is the only man in all of Texas who would revise \u2018Come and Take It\u2019 to \u2018Please, Come and Take It.\u2019 #borntorun https://t.co/YE6bbUuWqJ \u2014 Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) September 5, 2019\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke is no match for Meghan McCain.", "description": "\"I'm not living without guns.\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
