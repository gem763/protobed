Many asthmatics currently use metered dose inhalers, which contain substances known as hydrofluorocarbons to help propel the dose into their respiratory system. These devices have an estimated carbon footprint of 500g of carbon dioxide equivalent per dose. Five doses from a metered dose inhaler can have the same carbon emissions as a nine-mile trip in a car, Nice said. By comparison, dry powder inhalers contain just 20g of carbon dioxide per equivalent dose and work well for many patients.\n\nBut health authorities have repeatedly baulked at the price of greener, dry powder inhalers.\n\nBut, in their study published in BMJ Open, the researchers argue the NHS could actually cut costs by making their prescription inhalers more environmentally-friendly.\n\nThey say replacing one in 10 metred dose inhalers with the least expensive brands of dry powder equivalents could reduce drug costs by \u00a38.2million annually.\n\nDr Wilkinson, consultant in respiratory medicine from East and North Hertfordshire Trust, said: 'Any move towards \"greener\" inhalers would need to ensure that replacements were cost effective.\n\n'By switching to less expensive brands, we've shown it would still be possible to make a positive impact on carbon emissions while at the same time reducing drug costs.\n\n'It's important to stress that patients shouldn't stop using their usual treatments to reduce their carbon footprint.'\n\nPeople can also make sure they are using their inhalers correctly, return finished ones to pharmacies for proper disposal and avoid throwing away half-full items to help reduce the carbon footprint of their medication, he said.\n\nStudy co-author Dr James Smith, consultant in public health at Cambridge University, added: 'Climate change is a huge and present threat to health that will disproportionately impact the poorest and most vulnerable on the planet, including people with pre-existing lung disease.\n\n'Our study shows switching to inhalers which are better for the environment could help individuals, and the NHS as a whole, reduce their impact on the climate significantly.\n\n'This is an important step towards creating a zero carbon healthcare system fit for the 21st Century.'\n\nJessica Kirby, head of health advice at Asthma UK, said: 'We recognise the need to protect the environment, but it's critically important that people with asthma receive the medicines they need to stay well and avoid a life-threatening asthma attack.\n\n'Switching to a different type of inhaler can be complicated for people with asthma, as it involves learning a new inhaler technique, so it should only be done with support from a GP or asthma nurse.\n\n'Taking inhalers properly is essential to get the medicine you need and reduce the chance of side effects.\n\n'It is vital that you keep using your inhalers as prescribed. If you are concerned about the environmental effects, talk to your doctor or asthma nurse at your next annual asthma review, to see whether there is another type of inhaler that would work for you.'", "description": "The NHS is being urged to replace\u00a0metered-dose inhalers after Cambridge University researchers found they had a carbon footprint 37 times that of\u00a0dry powdered ones.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/12013184-0-Asthma_patients_are_being_encouraged_to_use_more_environmentally-a-22_1572354653338.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
