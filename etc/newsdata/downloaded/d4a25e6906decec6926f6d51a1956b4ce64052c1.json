They also want to \u201charmonise pay across the UK in a fair, transparent, and consistent structure\u201d.\n\nBalpa says 80 per cent of pilots voted in favour of strike action on a 72 per cent turnout. That means 56 per cent of union members voted for a stoppage.\n\nRyanair responded by saying the strike has the support of less than 30 per cent of its UK-based pilots, once non-members are taken into account.\n\nThe airline claims that last year its UK pilots agreed a 20 per cent pay rise, taking some senior captains\u2019 annual earnings up to \u00a3180,000.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe have repeatedly invited Balpa to meet with Ryanair to return to negotiations, and to call off these unsupported and failed pilot strikes, but Balpa offer no reason for their refusal to take up these invitations.\u201d\n\nBrian Strutton, general secretary of Balpa, told The Independent: \u201cThe crux of this is a lack of trust, by Ryanair pilots and their elected representatives, towards their management that still doesn\u2019t treat people with respect,\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve repeatedly asked for joint talks under the independent auspices of Acas \u2013 which Ryanair declines to do.\u201d\n\nWhen will the Ryanair pilots\u2019 strikes take place?\n\nThe third series of walkouts will see the flight crew stopping work on 18 and 19 September, then the remaining odd-numbered dates this month: 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 September.\n\nWhat will be the effect of the strike?\n\nFor the first two days of the stoppage, the airline says there will be no cancellations: \u201cRyanair expects all its flights to/from UK airports on Weds 18 and Thurs 19 [September] to operate as scheduled.\u201d\n\nIt praises \u201cthe efforts of over 95 per cent of our UK pilots who have confirmed that they will work their rosters, and will not support these failed Balpa strikes\u201d.\n\nThe Independent has sought clarification from Ryanair about the likely effect on the remaining five days this month.\n\nThe thinking behind the apparently odd timing is that it will play havoc with Ryanair\u2019s rostering patterns, and the airline will find itself with insufficient pilots with flying hours to spare to cover all the flights.\n\nWhen will I find out if my flight is affected?\n\nAhead of previous strikes, Ryanair has informed passengers on flights that it has decided to cancel two or three days ahead.\n\nMore than two million passengers are booked to fly with Ryanair on those five strike days, but a large majority of them are not on aircraft planned to be flown by UK pilots.\n\nThe Independent estimates that around 350,000 travellers have tickets for British-crewed flights on those dates.\n\nMany Ryanair services to and from the UK are operated by flight crew based abroad, and should be unaffected \u2013 unless for some reason pilots were transferred to cover for striking British crew.\n\nCould other days be affected?\n\nThe Ryanair business model is to get all aircraft out and back to base each day, meaning that crew do not \u201cnightstop\u201d. But because of the odd pattern of strikes, there may be a possibility that operations on 22, 24, 26 and 28 could be affected. Any disruption, though, is expected to be minimal.\n\nWhy is the effect of a pilots\u2019 strike at Ryanair so different from the industrial action at British Airways?\n\nFar more pilots at BA belong to Balpa \u2013 around nine out of 10 \u2013 with three-quarters of all the airline\u2019s pilots voting for, and presumably supporting, the walk-out.\n\nSecondly, Ryanair has only one kind of aircraft, the Boeing 737-800, which means any pilot can fly all planes in the fleet. In contrast, BA\u2019s operation from Gatwick and Heathrow has half a dozen. Therefore organising cover for flights is far trickier.\n\nLastly, the British Airways operation is far more complicated, with many long-haul services as well as European night stops.\n\nHow will the strikes end?\n\nManagement at both airlines appear to have chosen a campaign of attrition, on the presumption that the pilots will tire of the lack of pay \u2013 and, in BA\u2019s case, the loss of staff travel privileges \u2013 before the carrier makes any significant concessions.\n\nMeanwhile Ryanair is experiencing industrial relations problems on another front.\n\nCabin crew in Spain are striking in protest about plans to close bases in the Canary Islands. They are expected to take industrial action on 20, 22, 27 and 29 September.\n\nBut the impact is likely to be muted because of Spanish trade union law, which means staff are told many flights must be operated as a \u201cminimum service\u201d obligation.\n\nSo passengers may find that the crew are onboard for safety reasons but they do not offer any inflight sales.\n\nI am flying on a strike day. Can I cancel now, get a full refund and make alternative arrangements?\n\nNo. The only time the airline will offer a refund is once any cancellations have been decided. At this point cancelling for a refund would be unwise, because is absolves the airline of making alternative arrangements for your travel.\n\nUnder European air passengers\u2019 rights rules, Ryanair must find you a flight as soon as possible \u2013 including on another airline if necessary. Unless it can put you on another Ryanair flight at a very similar time to a different carrier, it must pay for a new ticket on British Airways, easyJet, Jet2 etc.\n\nRyanair must also meet attendant expenses, such as transport from Stansted to Gatwick or Heathrow to take a flight on easyJet or British Airways respectively.", "description": "In what is turning into an autumn of discontent for the travel industry, passengers are once again caught in the middle of another bitter dispute between an airline and its pilots.
