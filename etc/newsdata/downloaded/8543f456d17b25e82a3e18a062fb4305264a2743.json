Poor Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe most famous loser of a presidential campaign is peddling another book, so each day interviewers ask her vapid questions about how she feels. Naturally, she responds with vapid variations on a theme: Donald Trump is no good, he stole the election, the world is ending, I\u2019m fine, thank you.\n\nOnly she\u2019s not fine, or she wouldn\u2019t continue to embarrass herself by trying to rewrite history. She lost the election fair and square and even the \u201cresistance\u201d movement no longer pretends otherwise.\n\nYet nearly three years after the votes were counted and the states were called, and months after Robert Mueller found no collusion with Russia, she still has the nerve to insist that Trump is an \u201cillegitimate president.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nA brief detour down memory lane reveals the hypocrisy.

And I am appalled that someone who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that position.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHere we are, and she\u2019s the one still contesting the results and \u201ctalking down our democracy.\u201d Now that\u2019s horrifying.\n\nHer refusal to accept Trump\u2019s election can mean only one thing: In her own mind, she won the election and she\u2019s the real president. Oh dear.\n\nIn that case, we have another problem with only two options. She can see a shrink, or prove she\u2019s right.\n\nRun, Hillary, run.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING MICHAEL GOODWIN'S COLUMN IN THE NEW YORK POST\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MICHAEL GOODWIN", "description": "Her refusal to accept Trump\u2019s election can mean only one thing: In her own mind, she won the election and she\u2019s the real president.
