The U.S. withdrawal had opened the door for Turkey's offensive earlier this month.\n\nSyria's troop deployment sets up a potential wider conflict between Turkey and Syrian government forces. But Russia, Assad's ally, is currently hosting negotiations with Turkey about arrangements along the border.\n\nAssad says he has offered clemency to those who had joined the Kurdish-led forces, which his government considers secessionists.\n\nAssad spoke Tuesday while visiting troops in another part of Syria.\n\nThis is his first tour of areas in the northwestern province of Idlib that were recaptured from opposition fighters.

Ankara has so far rejected any notion of direct Turkey-Syria talks about its actions.\n\nPeskov spoke just ahead of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Russia on Tuesday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe wouldn't say if Putin-Erdogan talks in Sochi could lead to an extension of the 120-hour cease-fire that ends Tuesday, saying it would be up to Turkey to decide.\n\nHe noted that Russia acknowledges Turkey's right to secure its' border but added that it expects the Turkish offensive in Syria to be \"proportionate\" to that goal.\n\n___\n\n1:10 p.m.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he may meet with the leaders of France, Germany and Britain on the sidelines of a NATO meeting in London in December, to discuss Turkey's incursion into northeast Syria.\n\nThe comments on Tuesday came as Germany's defense minister proposed the establishment of an internationally controlled security zone in Syria and European Council President Donald Tusk called on Erdogan to pull his troops out of the region.\n\nErdogan did not respond to those statements but renewed a call on European nations to support Turkey's efforts to help resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees in a proposed \"safe zone\" in Syria's northeast.\n\nErdogan also slammed Iran after officials there denounced as \"unacceptable\" Turkey's plans to establish military observation posts in Syria.\n\nHe recalled the strong support Turkey gave Iran during its standoff with the United States over its nuclear program, as well as Turkey's partnership with Iran and Russia to end the conflict in Syria.\n\nErdogan says what Iran \"did is wrong\" and that he condemns it \"strongly.\"\n\n___\n\n12:20 p.m.\n\nSyrian president Bashar Assad has slammed Turkey's leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan as a \"thief\" as he made his first visit to areas in Idlib province recently retaken by Syrian government forces from Turkey-backed rebels.", "description": "Syrian President Bashar Assad says he is ready to support any \"popular resistance\" against Turkey's invasion of northeastern Syria.
