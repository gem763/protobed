There's also co-op \u2014 although who knows how well that will work at release \u2014 and AI bots to assist in boss fights.\n\nOn the opposite side of the gaming spectrum is Fifa 20, which drops across all platforms at the end of the week. Also releasing on Friday is Dragon Quest XI S for the Switch, as well as Dead by Daylight earlier in the week.\n\nIf that's not enough for Souls fans, The Surge 2 lands on Wednesday, as does Contra: Rogue Corps. Jedi Knight 2, Ori and the Blind Forest and Northgard are all hitting the Switch this week too. It's a busy time, so let's get started.\n\nPower Rangers: Battle for the Grid (PC)\n\nCONTRA: Rogue Corps (PC)\n\nCHERNOBYL: The Untold Story (PC)\n\nCat Quest 2 (PC)\n\nStar Wars: Jedi Knight 2 (Switch)\n\nNorthgard (Switch)\n\nGunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX (Switch)\n\nPaper Train (Switch)\n\nDarksiders 2 (Switch)\n\nCyber Protocol (Switch)\n\nFight'N Rage (Switch)\n\nDragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age (Switch)\n\nAkash: Path of the Five (Switch)\n\nOri and the Blind Forest (Switch)\n\nDreaming Canvas (Switch)\n\nCode Vein (PC, PS4, XBO)\n\nDead by Daylight (Switch)\n\nFIFA 20 (PC, PS4, XBO, Switch)\n\nNoita (PC)\n\nSpellcaster University (PC)\n\nThe Surge 2 (PC, PS4, XBO)\n\nSally\u2019s Law (XBO)\n\nRex Rocket (XBO)\n\nThe Adventures of Elena Temple (XBO)\n\nMining Rail 2 (XBO)\n\nTropico 6 (PS4)\n\nIntruders: Hide and Seek (PC)\n\nSuper Toy Cars 2 (PC)\n\nStygian: Reign of the Old Ones (PC)\n\nInfinity: Battlescape (PC)\n\nTrailers! Let's remind ourselves how good Jedi Knight 2 is by looking at the Switch version.\n\nStill kind of surprise Infinity: Battlescape hit its release date this week. I'll probably definitely check that one out, since I'm hugely into space explorers. But there's a ton of variety to choose from.
