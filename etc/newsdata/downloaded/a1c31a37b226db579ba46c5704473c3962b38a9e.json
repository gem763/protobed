This ruling undermines the laws enacted by Congress and the Trump Administration\u2019s careful efforts to implement those laws.\u201d\n\nThe Hill has also reached out to DHS for comment.\n\nDHS has touted the policy as a measure to \"enhance national security and public safety \u2014 while reducing government costs \u2014 by facilitating prompt immigration determinations.\"\n\nUpdated: 12:12 p.m.", "description": "A judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration policy that aimed to expedite the deportation of migrants\u00a0who can't prove they", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/immigrationdeportationprotest_102314getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
