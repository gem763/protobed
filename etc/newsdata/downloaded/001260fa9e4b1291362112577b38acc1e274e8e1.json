The ICIG concluded this month that the complaint was credible and a matter of \"urgent concern.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, subpoenaed Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, to turn over the complaint last week, saying Maguire was required to turn the document over to Congress under federal law but had not done so.\n\nBut in a letter to Schiff on Tuesday, the ODNI's general counsel said the agency overruled the ICIG and determined the complaint didn't meet the definition of \"urgent concern\" under the law. The definition concerns serious allegations related to \"the funding, administration or operation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority\" of the director of national intelligence, ODNI general counsel Jason Klitenic wrote in the letter.\n\n\"This complaint, however, concerned conduct by someone outside the Intelligence Community and did not relate to any 'intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision,\" Klitenic added. For that reason, after consulting with the Justice Department, the agency concluded it was not required to forward the complaint to the intelligence committees.\n\nRead more: Russia hacked the FBI to prevent the bureau from being able to track Russian spies in the US\n\nSchiff said on Tuesday that Klitenic's letter added to concerns that the ODNI was acting to shield Trump or someone in his inner circle from public scrutiny.\n\nIn addition to flagging the complaint with the Justice Department \u2014 which is unusual in and of itself for matters like these \u2014 Maguire also refused to comment on whether the White House was involved in the decision to withhold the complaint from the House Intelligence Committee, and whether it related to any matters being investigated by the panel.\n\nSchiff said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Maguire said he was not turning over the complaint, even though federal law mandates it, \"because he is being instructed not to\" and \"answering to a higher authority\" on the matter.\n\n\"This involved a higher authority, someone above the DNI,\" Schiff said. \"Well, there are only a few people above the DNI.\"\n\nSchiff said this week that since Maguire was refusing to turn over the complaint, he must appear before the committee on Thursday to further explain his decision.\n\nBut Klitenic said in his letter to Schiff that the agency believed it would be \"premature\" for Maguire to testify before the committee on Thursday. He added that Maguire wasn't available on such short notice and was still weighing how to respond to Schiff's demand.", "description": "It is unusual for the ODNI to consult the Justice Department on whistleblower complaints and then decide to withhold them from lawmakers.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d80de1e2e22af3ee37d37e8-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
