Jeff Van Drew (D-NJ) said Tuesday that he will likely vote against a resolution by House Democrats to formalize their secret impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, prompting more uncertainly around whether Thursday\u2019s expected vote will go on as planned.\n\nAsked by NBC News reporter Alex Moe if he supports the measure, Van Drew replied: \u201cI would imagine that I\u2019m not voting for it.\u201d Van Drew, whose district President Trump won in 2016, is among roughly a dozen House Democrats who oppose the impeachment inquiry. \u201cI have long maintained the position that the impeachment or potential impeachment would not be good for Democrats or Republicans,\u201d the lawmaker told Fox News in September.\n\nNew Jersey Democrat Jeff Van Drew says he will likely vote against impeachment process resolution. https://t.co/SVU0JwnDxZ \u2014 Ryan Hutchins (@ryanhutchins) October 29, 2019\n\nThe House announced Monday that it will move Thursday to determine whether to establish impeachment inquiry procedures into President Trump. The text of the resolution was not immediately released, but House Rule Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-MA) said it would \u201cprovide a clear path forward\u201d on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHowever, even before Van Drew\u2019s comments, House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) had already poured some cold water on plans to vote for the measure Thursday, telling reporters on Capitol Hill: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to consider whether or not it\u2019s ready to go on Thursday. I hope that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nPelosi wrote in a letter Monday that the resolution was not legally necessary but the House decided to take the vote \u201cto eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor weeks the president, his counsel in the White House and his allies in Congress have made the baseless claim that the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2018lacks the necessary authorization for a valise impeachment proceeding.\u2019 They argue that, because the House has not taken a vote, they may simply pretend the impeachment inquiry does not exist,\u201d the speaker wrote.\n\nPelosi\u2019s decision to formalize the impeachment inquiry followed weeks of pressure on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) from Republicans to bring transparency to the closed proceedings. Republicans have accused Schiff and his Democrat colleagues of selectively leaking excerpts of witnesses\u2019 testimony conducted inside Capitol Hill\u2019s SCIF room, known as a sensitive compartmented information facility. On Wednesday, nearly 30 House Republicans attempted to storm the chamber as Laura Cooper, a top Department of Defense official, was scheduled to testify.\n\nLast week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a resolution condemning the Democrats\u2019 secret impeachment and count 50 Republicans as cosponsors of the measure.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "Rep.\u00a0Jeff Van Drew (D-NJ) said Tuesday that he will likely vote against a resolution by House Democrats to formalize their secret impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1073991172-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
