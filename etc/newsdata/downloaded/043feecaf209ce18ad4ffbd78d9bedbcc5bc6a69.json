People want to see Brexit done. They overwhelmingly prefer to see that done with a good deal and that is what we have achieved,\" Javid said.\n\nLawmakers opposed to Brexit have warned that the prime minister's plan will hurt the economy.\n\nLast year, Britain's finance ministry estimated that the hit to growth from a free trade deal with the EU, similar to Johnson's plan, would be greater than the impact of closer ties proposed by former prime minister Theresa May.\n\nAsked about the Treasury's research, Javid said it was based on assumptions that did not necessarily apply to the new deal which offered the most promise for striking trade agreements with countries around the world.\n\nJohnson has said he will take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31, if necessary without a transition deal.\n\nHowever, British lawmakers have passed legislation that they say would force a Brexit delay rather than a no-deal Brexit.\n\nJavid said he saw a \"decent chance\" the plan would clear parliament, despite the opposition of a Northern Irish party which has been a key ally of Johnson.\n\nJavid also said the search for the next Bank of England governor was on track and was going \"very, very smoothly.\"\n\n\"I think the most important thing for me is I really, crucially value the independence of the Bank of England and I want someone who values that too and will be independent-minded,\" he said, declining to comment further.\n\nOn his budget plans, Javid said he believed interest rates would be low for a long time and he reiterated that he was looking at how to take advantage of cheap borrowing costs to increase long-term productive public investment.\n\n\"I traded bonds markets for 20 years and I've never seen anything like this,\" the former Deutsche Bank managing director said, explaining why he is considering new fiscal rules that are expected to relax the government's grip on the public finances.
