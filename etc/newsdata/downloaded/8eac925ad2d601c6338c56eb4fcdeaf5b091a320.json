His ability to pass the ball at his size and play multiple positions, coupled with his defensive potential, make him an obvious choice to be a lasting star in the league.\n\nThe problem with Simmons, as we well know, is that he cannot shoot. This has fundamentally changed the geometry of how teams defend the Sixers, and has limited his impact as teams have started to game plan for Simmons.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStill, the talent is there and the potential is not lost for some. According to Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, he believes that Simmons could be one of the best to ever play the game\u2026 if he figures out how to reliably shoot the ball.\n\nVia Michael Lee of The Athletic:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big Ben Simmons fan. And I want him to do like Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. Keep working on his game, become a very good shooter, because if he keeps working on his jump shot, he\u2019s going to be one of the best to ever do it,\u201d Barkley said.\n\nAs we have seen with former Philadelphia guard Markelle Fultz, it\u2019s not easy to fix what ails a person in the shooting department. Some players just never become good shooters, despite work with coaches and excellent practice habits.\n\nSimmons is still young at age 23, but patience will wear thin with Sixers fans if he can\u2019t figure out how to become a threat from beyond 10 feet. Until then, we can put the Hall of Fame hypotheticals on hold.", "description": "Only if Simmons gets a jumper will he find his true potential.
