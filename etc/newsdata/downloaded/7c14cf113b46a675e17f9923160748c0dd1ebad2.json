Shortly after, multiple reports indicated Oakland was considering suspending the wideout.\n\nAfter 24 hours of speculation and uncertainty about his status with the Raiders, Brown apologised to the team on Friday and head coach Jon Gruden said the plan was for Brown to play in Week 1 against the Broncos.\n\nHowever, that optimism soon vanished and Brown is now without a team.", "description": "The brother of Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr indicated the team felt they had no choice but to move on without Antonio Brown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1C8XJI199KS6C0xObdtESQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XFbTVQpN074sxG9szf7BcQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/a0f5bb67686c5c7280b102834ec5a981", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
