It's cool, let him do his thing.\n\nChisora is preparing for his first fight since his brutal knockout of Artur Szpilka at the O2 Arena\n\n'David Price has stepped up and I'm ready for whatever he brings. If he thinks I'm just going to stand there and be a punch bag like Dave Allen he is in for a shock. This is north versus south and in my home town I write the rules. Saturday 26th October get ready to scream TIMBER!'\n\nPrice is not daunted by taking the fight at short notice but unlike Chisora, he is parking the trash talk to focus on doing his talking in the ring.\n\n'I'm very excited for this fight,' Price said, following Tuesday's announcement. Derek is a great competitor and I'm sure he'll bring the best out of me. I kept in the gym all summer because I had a feeling I had to be ready for a call like this, and ready I am.'", "description": "Liverpool-born Price has less than a month to prepare for the all-British heavyweight fight, which takes place at the O2 Arena on October 26 on the undercard of Josh Taylor vs Regis Prograis.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/13/19441998-0-image-a-49_1570538005123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
