County hands $1.3 billion -- billion! -- to illegals for welfare", "language": "en", "text": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nIllegals living in Los Angeles County were handed almost $1.3 billion in welfare payouts between the months of 2015 and 2016, Fox News reported, citing data.\n\nThat\u2019s billion with a capital \u201cB.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a quarter of what the county distributed to its entire needy population in those same months.\n\nLiberals and government elitists always like to make the case that citizens ought to support some cheap-sounding fee- or tax-paying cause by grandly pronouncing, \u201cIt\u2019s just the cost of a cup of coffee,\u201d or \u201cIf everyone just gave up their Starbucks lattes, it\u2019d pay for itself.\u201d\n\nWell, guess what $1.3 billion could pay for?\n\nLos Angeles County is a massive draw for illegals, with more than a million flocking there and setting up home \u2014 and now we know why. Not only is it hallowed sanctuary ground; it\u2019s also, apparently, taxpayer-dole-out central.\n\nLook at this, from Robert Rector with the Heritage Foundation: \u201cThey get $3 in benefits for every $1 they spend,\u201d he said, speaking of the costs of education, police, fire, medical and housing that illegals get, compared to what they pay back by way of taxes.\n\nThis isn\u2019t conjecture. It\u2019s based on analysis of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services database.\n\nAmong the findings: In 2015, more than 58,000 families received $602 million in benefits. In 2016, more than 64,000 families received $675 million.\n\nIt\u2019s good to be an illegal, yes?\n\nBut the madness is statewide.\n\nIn 2013, the entire state of California spent a total of $25.3 billion on illegals \u2014 roughly $2,370 per U.S. citizen household, the Federal for American Immigration Reform reported.\n\nDemocrats, the ones fueling these taxpayer hand-outs, are completely off the rails.\n\nEven in the wildest of dreaming, tapping citizen tax dollars to support those who shouldn\u2019t be in the country in the first place is not sustainable economic policy.\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news. President Donald Trump is now in the White House. And chief among his executive concerns is clamping the border, and reeling in sanctuary cities.\n\nThank goodness.\n\nA country run by amnesty-loving Democrats, where taxes are stripped from citizens and distributed to illegals, is a country on a crash course for bankruptcy. After all, it doesn\u2019t take long to get the word out whenever free money, free benefits and free stay-out-of-jail cards are up for offer.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
