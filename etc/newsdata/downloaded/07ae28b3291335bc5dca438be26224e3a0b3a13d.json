The activists then called for 125 of the portraits to be stolen, matching the number of days it took France to exceed its annual carbon footprint allowance this year.\n\n125\u00e8me portrait Macron d\u00e9croch\u00e9 dans la commune Basque d'Espelette, 1 mois jour pour jour avant l'ouverture du #G7 \u00e0 Biarritz.
