Here is this week\u2019s question.\n\n\n\nQ. I've read that property taxes are higher in Greece than many other European countries. Why is that?\n\n\n\nA. The annual real estate holding tax, or ENFIA, in Greece is in the upper 25% of European countries, according to George S. Kounoupis, a lawyer at Hahalis & Kounoupis, which has offices in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Greece.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation found that property taxation in Europe averages at 4.6% of the tax revenue the country makes, but in Greece, it\u2019s 8.1%.\n\nMore: What are the Property Taxes on a Cannes, France, Home?\n\nProperty taxes rose during the last financial crisis in Greece, Mr. Kounoupis explained.\n\n\n\nCurrently, homeowners in Greece pay a \u201cbasic tax,\u201d which varies depending on where the property is located, as well as other factors like its age and condition, according to the Greek Law Digest. An annual supplementary tax is also charged, which is a progressive tax that ranges from 0.15% to 1.15% of the value of the property exceeding \u20ac200,000 (US$220,484).\n\n\n\nMr. Kounoupis noted that a typical home that\u2019s valued at around \u20ac400,000 might have annual taxes of about \u20ac600.\n\n\n\n\u201cCompared to the U.S., they are ridiculously low,\u201d he added. In addition, the government is currently rolling out changes to the tax law that will reduce the tax for many homeowners by 2020.\n\nFrom Penta: Porsche Debuts a More Affordable Taycan\u2014and Plans a Plug-In Plane\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who took office in July, and his administration are working to lessen the burden for home owners in the country, Mr. Kounoupis said.\n\n\n\nHis administration has cut the tax for 2019, according to the National Herald, the U.S.-based newspaper that is published in both Greek and English. Rates have dropped between 10% and 30%, depending on property values.\n\n\n\nThose with total real estate assets valued up to \u20ac60,000 will see a 30% decrease, while those with property valued at more than \u20ac1 million will see a 10% drop. Additional reductions are expected for next year, Mr. Kounoupis said.\n\n\n\nClick to Read Tax Experts Share Answers and Advice for Readers\u2019 Pressing Tax Questions\n\nEmail your questions to editors@mansionglobal.com.
