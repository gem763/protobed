The case resulted in a record-breaking settlement that some critics still decried as too weak.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s investigation stemmed from Facebook\u2019s entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed tens of millions of Facebook users\u2019 personal information. The incident, along with Facebook\u2019s other data mishaps, led FTC lawyers to conclude that the tech giant had violated a prior government order to improve its privacy practices. That opened the door for the agency to seek civil penalties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFacebook will have to pay a record-breaking fine for violating users\u2019 privacy. But the FTC wanted more.\n\nInitially, FTC staffers computed that Facebook\u2019s misdeeds could result in a fine into the tens of billions of dollars, The Post first reported this summer, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. It is not clear whether the agency presented that amount to Facebook before the company\u2019s February white paper; key numbers were redacted from the copy given to The Post. But the document still included a fiery response from Facebook, which called the FTC\u2019s proposed fine \u201cexcessive, arbitrary, and capricious\u201d and said it violated the Constitution and the FTC\u2019s governing laws.\n\nThe \u201cproposed penalty is unconstitutional, unlawful and unsupported by the allegations in the draft complaint,\u201d lawyers wrote. \u201cNo court would entertain such a penalty, and neither will Facebook.\"\n\nThe legal jostling between Facebook and the FTC illustrates the precarious decision that government regulators ultimately would have to make \u2014 try to fight the tech giant in federal court, embarking on a lengthy, painful legal battle, or settle with the company and obtain whatever relief Facebook was willing to stomach.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUltimately the agency, led by Republican Joe Simons, chose the latter option. The resulting $5 billion civil penalty against Facebook set a record for a federal privacy fine. The agency also forced Facebook to submit to unprecedented federal oversight. Announcing the agreement in July, Simons and his Republican colleagues said in a statement that it was \u201chighly unlikely the Commission could have obtained this magnitude of injunctive relief if we had proceeded with litigation.\u201d\n\nBut the penalties proved insufficient for many privacy advocates, including the FTC\u2019s two Democratic members and congressional lawmakers from both parties. Critics said the fine should have been higher and the punishments tougher \u2014 and some said a court fight may have been necessary to result in full relief for consumers.\n\n\u201cThe fine we paid is unprecedented. It\u2019s the largest fine in the history of the Federal Trade Commission and exceeds what the FTC would have been able to obtain in court, as experts have said,\u201d company spokeswoman Monique Hall said Monday in a statement, adding that the settlement included \u201csignificant accountability and oversight measures.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe FTC declined to comment.\n\nFor Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg, FTC settlement could bring a new era of accountability\n\nCentral to Facebook\u2019s analysis was that consumers were not harmed \u2014 that they did not suffer personal injury, such as a loss of money, from the company\u2019s mishandling of their personal information. As a result, Facebook said, legal precedent warranted a civil penalty \u201csubstantially lower\u201d than the maximum allowed under law. Facebook also argued that it \u201cdid not profit from alleged violations\u201d of its users\u2019 privacy.\n\nIn doing so, Facebook lawyers sought to use the FTC\u2019s past words against it, pointing to the commission\u2019s prior record for a privacy fine: a $22.5 million penalty levied against Google in 2012.\n\nThe FTC at the time faulted Google for misrepresenting users\u2019 ability to control when they were tracked on the Web. When privacy advocates challenged the settlement in court as being too weak, federal regulators said their work was \u201csufficient\u201d to protect consumers and would send a message to the tech industry. Years later, Facebook said its wrongdoing was \u201ccomparable,\u201d justifying a similar punishment for its mishaps.\n\nPrivacy groups also have challenged the FTC\u2019s settlement with Facebook, which is pending approval by a federal judge. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a motion in court earlier this year arguing the deal \u201cfails to safeguard the interests of Facebook users.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Facebook initially mounted an aggressive legal offensive to stave off federal regulators who sought to fine the tech giant tens of billions of dollars for privacy abuses, arguing in newly revealed documents that it didn't cause consumers harm or profit from mishandling their data \u2014 and that the government would probably lose in court anyway.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ozeq-fU6Ce1OB9vlY7NY912-nGA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZBM6BTW3BUI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
