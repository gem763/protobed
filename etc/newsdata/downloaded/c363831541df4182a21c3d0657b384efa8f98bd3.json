If it's gray, I pick colors for gray,\" he explained.\n\nMilan Fashion Week is his chance to flaunt the finest items in his wardrobe to show that age is irrelevant when it comes to personal style. \"During fashion week, since I'm vain, I try to change my look every day,\" Manca said.\n\nMorozzi, a fashion advisor at Milan's Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti, has a simpler approach to fashion, and on this particular day is wearing her favorite knitwear complemented by stacks of gold rings and blue-rimmed glasses.\n\n\"Being elegant is probably when you can match who you are to what you are wearing,\" said Morozzi, who launched the Do-Knit-Yourself project to share her love for knitting and embroidery.\n\nFashion week might spotlight Milan's distinctive aesthetic, but according to Morozzi, Corti and Manca, it won't fade when the models, editors and designers move onto the next stop: Paris Fashion Week.\n\nIn Morozzi's words, it's style like theirs that \"defines the image of a city.\"\n\nThe video above is a BRAV\u00d2 production for CNN Style.", "description": "From the models on the runways to the influencers in the front rows, it's easy to assume that Milan's fashion scene is solely the domain of the young.
