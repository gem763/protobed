Despite talk of new energy and the advent of electric vehicles, we remain reliant on fossil fuels in our daily lives.\n\nMany of the world\u2019s energy companies have failed to do much in recent times in terms of their share price. This includes super-major BP, which arguably offers value, trading on a price to earnings ratio (PE) of 11 times and offering a yield of about 6.5 per cent. The latter seems very attractive when compared with ever-dwindling cash rates.\n\nCritics cite the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico as a drawback, but the reality is that incident was almost a decade ago. BP has paid its dues and is moving on, as evidenced by recent quarterly results.\n\nA better operational performance in the June quarter of 2019 cushioned the impact of softer energy prices at the time. Underlying replacement cost profits fell by just 0.4 per cent year-on-year to $US2.8 billion. Lower energy prices were countered by a rise in production, which increased 3.4 per cent to an average 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nA key driver of the better result was the ramping up of new operations, including Culzean in the North Sea. Culzean was the fourth new start-up for 2019, which in our view is an exceptional outcome. Overall, BP plans to add 900,000 barrels a day of new production by 2021, largely through new projects.\n\nGearing levels at June 30, 2019, rose to 31 per cent (with $US3.5 billion net debt), owing to the acquisition of BHP\u2019s onshore US oil and gas interests for $US10.5 billion late last year. The deal has added 190,000 barrels a day to production, and management has committed to divestments to reduce the debt load \u2013 asset sales of $US10 billion ($14.75 billion) are pegged through 2019 and 2020.", "description": "The oil major offers value, trading on a price to earnings ratio of 11 times and offering a yield of an attractive 6.5 per cent compared with dwindling cash rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/989c1d2142f03373396957defe8d27ee84a82921", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
