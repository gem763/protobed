She served as a senior official on the Securities and Futures Commission \u2013 the HKEX\u2019s regulatory body \u2013 at a time when the regulator was trying to rebuild Hong Kong\u2019s market after the 1987 crash.\n\nHer appointment came at a key moment for the HKEX which has been positioning itself as the go-to bourse for mainland companies in the face of competition from global and regional exchanges, as well as China\u2019s Shanghai and Shenzen bourses. Cha was instrumental in transforming Hong Kong into an international market by promoting IPOs.\n\nThe Hong Kong exchange describes the LSE bid as \u201cconnecting the established financial markets in the West with the emerging financial markets in the East, particularly in China.\u201d\n\nCha herself was quoted as saying: \u201cWe believe a combination of HKEX and LSEG represents a highly compelling strategic opportunity to create a global market infrastructure group, bringing together the largest and most significant financial centres in Asia and Europe. Following early engagement with LSEG, we look forward to working in detail with the LSEG Board to demonstrate that this transaction is in the best interests of all stakeholders, investors and both businesses.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the LSE called the bid \u201chighly conditional\u201d and \u201cunsolicited.\u201d The LSE said it remains committed to buying Refinitiv, held by Blackstone BX, +0.70% and Thomson Reuters TRI, -1.57% .\n\nBetween 2012 and 2018 she was the Hong Kong delegate to the 12th National People\u2019s Congress of China.\n\nShe also holds non-executive positions on the boards of HSBC HSBA, +2.17% , and consumer goods group Unilever ULVR, -0.11% .\n\nCha was educated in the U.S. with a BA from University of Wisconsin and a Juris Doctorate degree from the University of Santa Clara.", "description": "When Laura Cha outlined her three-year strategic plan to boost the competitiveness of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, few imagined that included trying to...", "authors": ["Lina Saigol"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR062_laura__ZG_20190911061135.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
