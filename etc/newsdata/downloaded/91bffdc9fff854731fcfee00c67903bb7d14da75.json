Euro/sterling was little changed at 88.445 pence.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday a Brexit deal could be clinched by the end of October to allow the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, after what he called a very positive meeting with Britain's Boris Johnson.\n\nMarshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global, said he found it hard to change his pessimistic view on the pound, \"especially since we don\u2019t know what the two sides actually discussed.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m also worried that anything that\u2019s acceptable to Ireland might prove unacceptable to the rest of the UK Parliament, and enough MPs might be willing to choose national suicide rather than accept the unacceptable. I will therefore retain my negative bias for now, but recommend watching the situation closely,\" Glitter said.\n\nElsewhere, the Swedish crown, which has been beaten up by the prospects of dismal global economic growth as result of trade tensions, got pushed up to a four-day high of 10.8180 against the euro, though its long-term weak trend remains unbroken for now.\n\nThe Norwegian crown was up 0.2% at 10.0280 against the common currency.
