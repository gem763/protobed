A pair of freshly leaked images have given us our best glimpse of the rear-facing camera yet and it's looking very impressive. Here are the details.\n\nThe photo above was shared on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo before being mysteriously yanked offline. In addition to the white finish and garishly coloured power button, the image clearly shows Google's new triple lens camera system. This is a huge upgrade from the Pixel 3 which came with a single 12.2-megapixel sensor.\n\nAnother image that briefly popped up on Weibo appears to show an 8x zoom in action. (The Pixel 3 had a 6x zoom.)\n\nIt's not possible to tell from the photo whether the 8x zoom is optical, digital or a combination of both. In any event it's a safe bet that the results will look suitably crisp on Facebook and Instagram at the very least.\n\nAccording to previous reports, the Pixel 4's rear camera array is expected to include a 16MP telephoto lens and a 12MP primary snapper with phase-detect auto-focus. An official image shared by Google also revealed some intriguing sensor-like holes near the camera lens which may have something to do with Project Soli (AKA Google's radar-based gesture technology.)\n\nAs previously reported, the Pixel 4 marks Google's first serious stab at best-in-class camera hardware. Previously, its phones have chiefly relied on astonishingly good imaging software for its photos alongside user-facing tools like Top Shot and Night Sight.\n\nWith the Pixel 4, it looks like we'll finally be getting the best of both worlds, especially when it comes wide-angle photography. If that's not enough to get you excited, Google is also reportedly working on a DSLR-style attachment lens in a bid to take its camera game to another level.\n\nIn terms of its wider specifications, the Pixel 4 looks to be a gentler evolution of its predecessor. If reports are true, it will come with just 6GB of RAM and a stingy 2800mAh battery for the base model.

Based on these specs and Google's existing pedigree, you can rest assured that it will have one of the best cameras on the market. Now if only they can do something about that big-arse camera bump.", "description": "The Google Pixel 4 might not be the prettiest smartphone on the block - but it will have one of the best cameras.
