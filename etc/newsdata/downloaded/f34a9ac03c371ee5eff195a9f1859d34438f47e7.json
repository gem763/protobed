So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country,\" the architect of North Carolina's 2016 redistricting process said at the time.\n\nThe big picture: Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion, didn't just say that those two specific instances of gerrymandering can stand. He said the federal courts will never draw a line to declare that any partisan gerrymander went too far.\n\nHow to draw legislative districts is a political question, Roberts said, and it's not the courts' place to decide \"how much partisan dominance is too much.\"\n\nStates can answer that question for themselves, he said, by establishing nonpartisan redistricting commissions or changing their criteria.\n\nThe other side: \"The politicians who benefit from partisan gerrymandering are unlikely to change partisan gerrymandering. And because those politicians maintain themselves in office through partisan gerrymandering, the chances for legislative reform are slight,\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissent joined by the other three liberal justices.\n\nKagan also warned that gerrymandering will keep getting more extreme as the technology behind it advances, citing the advanced computer modeling that helped produce North Carolina's GOP-advantaged map.\n\nGo deeper: Supreme Court freezes citizenship question for 2020 Census", "description": "Chief Justice John Roberts said it's a political issue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/4KkdDkYtSnroCGNkH6Bt8dwMIaY=/0x0:6720x3780/1920x1080/2019/06/26/1561554426938.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-27"}
