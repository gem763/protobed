Though US equities rose last week as trade tensions eased, they trimmed gains Friday afternoon when reality set in. The deal Trump called the biggest \u201cin the history of our Country\u201d had a significant shortcoming: it wasn\u2019t a signed document yet, even though it has, in effect, been on the table for more than a year.\n\nSo economists reacted with a range of scepticism and doubt about what it means for growth projections that are coming down as the 18-month trade war drags on.\n\n\u201cThere is not yet a viable path to existing tariffs declining, and tariff escalation remains a meaningful risk,\u201d Morgan Stanley strategists Michael Zezas and Meredith Pickett wrote on Friday. \u201cThus, we do not yet expect a meaningful rebound in corporate behaviour that would drive global growth expectations higher.\u201d\n\nRaymond Yeung, chief Greater China economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, said that despite the latest progress, tensions are unlikely to ease soon and the economic risks will linger as talks move through various stages.\n\n\u2018High hurdles\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Phase I agreement mainly covers agricultural purchases, tariff suspension, and market access,\u201d Yeung wrote in a research note Saturday with ANZ colleagues Betty Rui Wang and Zhaopeng Xing. \u201cBut core issues of technology transfer and national security still face high hurdles before a resolution in our view.\u201d\n\nWhat economists say\n\n\u201cPast experience is that US\u2013China trade agreements aren\u2019t worth the paper they are written on, and this one hasn\u2019t even been written down. For now, though, indications on trade are a little more positive. If that persists, it could help put a floor under sliding global growth.\u201d\n\nChinese GDP data for the third quarter, slated for release Friday, is expected to show that output growth in the three months to September eased to 6.1%, the slowest in almost three decades. That pace would be barely enough to allow the Communist Party to claim it\u2019s hitting its long-term growth targets.\n\nFor economists to get more optimistic about the outlook, Washington and Beijing between now and the November leaders\u2019 meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum will have to make more progress on thornier trade issues such as enforcement and intellectual-property protections.\n\n\u201cUntil such evidence is available, we must conclude that this pause is more \u2018uncertain\u2019 than \u2018durable,\u2019\u201d the Morgan Stanley strategists wrote.", "description": "The pledges China and the US made to keep prospects alive for a comprehensive trade deal did little to alter the deteriorating growth outlooks for both countries because they were sealed with something economists don\u2019t trust: a handshake.", "authors": ["Brendan Murray"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7712/ed19b645c53140b790209708e41ac565.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
