I was so self-conscious.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says since then she realises how widespread the problem is: \u2018I get so many women coming in for corrective work after getting botched fillers, and they always say the same thing, \u2018I went somewhere cheap.\u2019 But you have to think, it\u2019s cheap for a reason, and it ends up costing you far more to fix it.\u2019\n\nAfter her appointment \u2013 during which one millilitre of filler was injected into her lips \u2013 she experienced some swelling, which she assumed was normal.\n\nA week later, though, it became clear that something had gone terribly wrong.\n\nShe explained: \u2018My lips were very lumpy and uneven, so I went back to the injector who had done them, and they suggested that even more filler would even them out.\n\n\u2018Looking back, I know that\u2019s not right now, but at the time, I trusted what I was being told and just wanted it fixed.\n\n\u2018So, I had another one millilitre injected \u2013 meaning I\u2019d had two millilitres in just two weeks.\n\nShe paid \u00a3300 for the fillers after admiring the way they created pouts on other people (PA Real Life/Collect)\n\nSarah\u2019s lips 24 hours after having the filler dissolved (PA Real Life/Collect)\n\n\u2018I woke up and my lips were more swollen than ever \u2013 literally about two centimetres in front of my face \u2013 and rock hard.\n\n\u2018I had to go into work and my practice manager was really shocked, asking me what on earth had happened.\u2019\n\nWith a family wedding approaching, Sarah had no choice but to find a dermatologist who could help reverse the damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter researching extensively, she found a specialist who was able to inject her with hyaluronidase \u2013 a family of enzymes that can break down hyaluronic acid, the ingredient used in most lip fillers.\n\n\u2018That cost me \u00a3700 \u2013 more than double what I\u2019d paid for the original fillers,\u201d she said. \u201cI did have a slight allergic reaction to the hyaluronidase and my mouth swelled, but I was given antihistamines.\n\n\u2018I was under review for two days after that and, thankfully, my lips began returning to normal.\u2019\n\nNow, after becoming officially trained and qualified to perform injectable filler procedures, she works at The Dental Surgery in Clifton Village, Bristol, where she uses her own experience to make sure patients fully understand the potential risks.\n\nShe explained: \u2018I was never told about risks or complications, so I want to make sure that the patients who come to me understand exactly what will happen before I put that needle in.\n\nThe lumps in Sarah\u2019s lips (PA Real Life/Collect)\n\n\u2018If you don\u2019t explain to them that there may be complications, and that hyaluronidase, which they would need to dissolve the filler, is very expensive \u2013 plus there is currently a shortage in many parts of the world, so not every doctor has easy access to it \u2013 then you are leaving them vulnerable.\n\n\u2018The NHS shouldn\u2019t have to be dealing with people going to A&E with complications like occlusions, when blood vessels get blocked, but the difficulty is that people aren\u2019t told the risks and so don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah has expressed concern about the rise in people with no medical training injecting filler into their clients.\n\nShe said: \u2018It\u2019s worrying the amount of unqualified people now doing dermal fillers. Beauticians don\u2019t necessarily go through proper medical training \u2013 they just learn from each other \u2013 and can\u2019t prescribe medication if needs be, or deal with complications.\n\n\u2018Doctors and dentists train for years and years, yet there are people going on one day courses claiming to be able to do the same thing.\n\n\u2018When they\u2019re charging low fees for work too, you have to ask yourself why. How cheap is the filler they\u2019re using?\n\n\u2018You can easily buy it online for as little as \u00a335 a millilitre \u2013 and that\u2019s not something I\u2019d put in my own face, let alone my patients.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
