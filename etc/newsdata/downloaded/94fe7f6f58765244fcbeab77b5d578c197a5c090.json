I forget so much at my age, which is very annoying. If Nico asks me to go through the routine on my own I wouldn\u2019t have a clue. I can dance as well as him, but he needs to think for me.\n\n(Image: Tom Dymond)\n\n\u201cIn the past five years I haven\u2019t noticed any change to my physical ability, but my memory is going. I do lots and lots of crossword puzzles to try to remember things, but they sometimes take a long time.\u201d\n\nHow long does she think she\u2019ll go on dancing for? Paddy chuckles. \u201cWhen am I going to stop? That\u2019s what I keep asking Nico and he just looks at me and shakes his head and that\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cWhen Nico starts getting tired, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll stop.\n\n\u201cNico has got a mama who has been very ill and he needs to look after her too. He\u2019s a very busy man. I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll be able to keep going. As for me, I\u2019ll just go on as long as I can.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t expect me to still be dancing when I\u2019m 110. Not that I\u2019d be too frail. It\u2019s just that when I\u2019m that old I think I\u2019d be so wrinkly I\u2019ll need a facial redo or have to wear a mask to go on a stage.\u201d\n\nPaddy jokes that she thinks her memory loss is actually one of the reasons why she\u2019s so fit and nimble.\n\n(Image: Tom Dymond)\n\n\u201cI tell people it\u2019s my brain that\u2019s keeping me healthy. You see, I go all the way down the 28 steps to my garage, and when I get there I can\u2019t remember what it was I needed to go for. So I have to go all the way back up and then remind myself, and then come back down again. So I say it\u2019s my faltering memory that\u2019s keeping me going.\u201d\n\nMost twenty-somethings would even have trouble pulling off Paddy\u2019s jaw-dropping acrobatics. But she insists she doesn\u2019t event feel a twinge when she leaves the stage, and says she\u2019s only ever injured herself once during her time performing with Nico - and it wasn\u2019t on the dance floor.\n\nThe pensioner, who lives in Gandia, Spain, says: \u201cA few years ago I was climbing a ladder at home to cut a tree and the ladder slipped and I fell on the floor.\n\n\u201cI cracked my ribs. It was the side that Nico was going to hold me for an upcoming dance, so he changed the whole choreography to hold me on the other side, and we were able to do the routine.\u201d\n\nOld folks up and down the country who worry about taking a tumble just pottering around their own homes might be asking how Paddy has kept herself in such good fettle, but the widow can\u2019t give an answer.\n\nShe says: \u201cI don\u2019t do anything particularly to keep fit. I horrify people because I say I like sugar, sweets and chocolate, and condensed milk on my cereals in the morning. It's just about keeping active in between.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a family trait. My parent were always very active. I have a seven-year-old great granddaughter and she\u2019s a little wisp of a thing but she plays rugby and lots of other sports.\n\n\u201cWhen I go back to England and meet up with old schoolfriend they all say, \u2018you were always the active one, you were never sitting around doing nothing\u2019. The good side to it is being an inspiration to other people.\n\n\u201cI get lots of emails from elderly people. Nico reads them because I\u2019m not good with technology. It makes me happy to hear people saying that having seen me they\u2019ve decided they ought to get out of their chairs and switch of their TVs and do something.\n\n\u201cWhat we do inspires people and makes people smile, and I\u2019m very pleased about that.\n\n\u201cMy grandchildren are really happy about it too. They say having me as a grandmother often gets them an extra pint in the pub!\u201d\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\nPaddy started dancing at the age of two-and-a-half and trained as a ballerina, and was working full-time in the theatre at the age of 17, but she gave it up aged 22 to start a family after marrying her late husband David.\n\nInstead, she raised four children and worked six days a week in her fabric shop in Stourbridge, West Midlands.\n\nShe kept her interest in showbusiness alive by founding the Stourbridge Pantomine Company, which is still going strong today.\n\nPaddy and David decided to relocate to Spain after she came home from work on Christmas Eve and collapsed with flu. She says: \u201cI was terribly ill and didn\u2019t come round until New Year\u2019s Eve. My husband said, \u2018that\u2019s it, we\u2019re not spending another cold winter in England\u2019. A customer at my shop told us about the Gandia area of Spain, and we went there and it was so beautiful. We bought the first house we looked at.\u201d\n\nBut what was supposed to be a happy move together to warner climes ended up turning to tragedy.\n\nPaddy says: \u201cIt was the day before we were moving. We were in a house without furniture, everything was sold and everything was ready to go.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cDavid hadn\u2019t been sleeping well, he was in another bedroom. And I got up and saw blood across he carpet. I called the doctor immediately, and when he came I told him we were about to emigrate to Spain.\n\nHe says: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ll have to take your husband to hospital\u2019. By that evening we\u2019d been told that he had cancer.\u201d\n\nDiagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, David underwent several rounds of chemotherapy, while keeping a picture of their dream Spanish villa next to his bed to help him get through it.\n\nWith his cancer finally in remission, the couple finally moved to Spain in September 2001, but the leukaemia returned 18 months later and, after two more rounds of chemo failed, he was given two weeks to live.\n\nPaddy remembers: \u201cThe medics in Britain were quite happy that he\u2019d beaten the cancer. David had to come off the plane in a wheelchair, but once we were there in the warm weather he was soon feeling better.\n\n\u201cWe never imagined that the cancer would come back. It was very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nAfter 47 years of marriage she was alone in Spain, but Paddy says she never once thought about returning to the UK.\n\nShe says: \u201cEveryone thought I would, but there was no way I was coming back. It had been our dream to live in Spain, and I wanted to live that dream for both of us.\n\n\u201cI decided to find something to keep me busy, so I joined a salsa dance class near my home, and Nico was running it. As soon as I walked in there I knew I had come back to my first love.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nPaddy says that the first time Nico tried to throw her into the air he asked other men to stand around to catch her if she fell, but \u201cI just went for it. I didn\u2019t even worry about being injured.\u201d\n\nSince then she and Nico have won millions of fans around the world, appearing on TV talent contests including Spain\u2019s You Are Worth It and the Argentinian equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing .\n\nShe also made it into the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest acrobatic salsa dancer.\n\nWhat would David have made of her late lease of life and new-found fame?\n\n\u201cOh, he would be over the moon,\u201d said Paddy. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t dance at all, he had two left feet, but he always encouraged me to dance again. He would be very proud of all that I have achieved.\u201d\n\n* Britain\u2019s Got Talent: the Champions - Final, tonight (SAT), 8.30pm, ITV.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Paddy Jones is still doing the salsa aged 85 but says she sometimes struggles to remember her dance moves", "authors": ["Matt Roper", "Image", "Tom Dymond", "Rex Features"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20443189.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Paddy-and-Nicko.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
