If for a modest sum I could make that change, I\u2019m gonna do it,\u201d Levy told a local CBS affiliate.\n\nPalm Beach school district spokeswoman Julie Houston Trieste confirmed the donation to The Washington Post. She noted that while students were still served lunch and other free meals even if they had outstanding lunch balances, donations could still help families unable to pay.\n\nAD\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a member of the community has stepped up to pay off lunch debt. According to Trieste, an anonymous donor paid $5,000 earlier this year.\n\nAD\n\nWith the total amount of lunch debt for the school district coming to about $50,000, \u201cThere\u2019s still definitely a need there for sure,\u201d Trieste said.\n\nThe school district\u2019s website provides instructions for how individuals can donate funds to reduce student lunch debt. Last year, $21,000 in donations helped 4,000 students pay off their lunch debts, according to the district.\n\nTrieste said while Levy\u2019s act of kindness had not set off a wave of donations, she said individuals had expressed interest in starting GoFundMe accounts or had reached out to the school district to find out how they could contribute funds of their own.\n\nAD\n\nLevy told local media that the October donation would not be his last.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do either a GoFundMe page or a fundraising page that can raise money every quarter, so lunch debt never accumulates so that children never have to worry about a hot meal and parents never have to worry about paying the bill,\u201d he told CBS12.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cI thought, you know something?
