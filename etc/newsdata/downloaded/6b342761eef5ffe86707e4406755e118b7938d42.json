No longer mere apartments, they\u2019re residences, a new class of luxury living that is cropping up in blue ribbon suburbs in tightly held inner city areas and premium coastal regions across the country.\n\nIt\u2019s a niche buyer market which luxury Sydney developer Fiducia Property Group has dubbed the \u201crightsizers\u201d\u2014a class of buyer who is at the right time in their life for luxury, substance and convenience.\n\nIn Sydney these premium buildings are found in up-market established suburbs on the city fringe, in the eastern suburbs and lower north shore. They provide downsizers, who are transitioning from expansive family homes, with an abundance of space, privacy and exclusivity to the ease of access to village atmospheres and an abundance of amenities such as cafes, restaurants and retail.\n\nThis trend isn\u2019t limited to Sydney alone. A heavy focus on owner-occupiers and downsizers is also appearing in Queensland\u2019s premium coastal areas on the Gold and Sunshine coasts, Melbourne\u2019s Bayside suburbs and on the country\u2019s west coast in Perth.\n\nThere\u2019s an emphasis on architectural integrity\u2014inside and out\u2014a reflection of these discerning buyers\u2019 need for something unique without having to compromise on location and lifestyle after selling the family home.\n\nThese collections of homes, meticulously designed and curated, feature spacious interiors and opulent finishes, while exclusive residents\u2019 only amenities such as private clubs, dining rooms and wine cellars are mandatory inclusions.\n\nAn aging population, buyer demand for quality over quantity and the transformation of prime inner-city sites into highly sought-after urban locations are some of the reasons driving the trend.\n\nStrong pre-sales evidence appears to support the trend, whether it\u2019s the overwhelming pre-launch registration numbers for ONE Subiaco in Perth, Western Australia, or the success of the locals-only marketing campaign for White Main Beach on the Gold Coast in Queensland.\n\nAfter two years of softer residential market conditions in Australia, the buoyancy around this type of product suggests renewed confidence in the luxury apartment market.\n\nAll projects mentioned below have either recently been launched to the market or are soon to be released. At the time of publication, every project mentioned still has stock available for purchase, with some already under construction.", "description": "From Sydney to Queensland, these homes are designed for a niche market with evolving tastes", "authors": ["Michelle Singer"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-110935?size=1.8285714285714285&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
