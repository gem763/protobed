Someone Photoshopped a picture of the hero dog over an Associated Press photo of 2017 Medal of Honor recipient James McCloughan, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThis side-by-side photo will show the similarities.\n\n(Photo: Alex Brandon via AP/Twitter/@realdonaldtrump) More\n\nAlthough Trump tweeted the photo, it originated on the Instagram page of the conservative news outlet the Daily Wire.\n\nThe hero dog has never been to the White House and is back on duty despite being injured by an electric cable during an explosion, according to U.S. Central Command.\n\nHuffPost reached out to the White House for comment on the decision to post a doctored photo, but no one immediately responded.\n\nBut many Twitter users had a bone to pick with the decision.\n\nTrump awarded the Medal of Honor to James McCloughan. He was credited with saving the lives of 10 men in a brutal, battle in Vietnam.\n\nYesterday, Trump posted a photo of that moment with McCloughan\u2019s image replaced by that of a dog.https://t.co/ZGQsVfp2gr \u2014 \"Never Trumper\" Island Girl \ud83c\udfdd\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf3b (@DearGoodPeople) October 30, 2019\n\nIf Barack Obama had done this, GOP leadership would call for him to be censured by the House.
