(AP) - The Indianapolis Colts have stood in the Tennessee Titans\u2018 way starting first with Peyton Manning, then Andrew Luck at quarterback.\n\nNow it\u2019s Jacoby Brissett\u2019s turn.\n\nAnd for the Titans, it\u2019s a big opportunity finally to flip the script.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new year,\u201d Titans tight end Delanie Walker said. \u201cI don\u2019t dwell on the past. We look to the future. We\u2019re going to try to change that for sure here.\u201d\n\nThe Titans won the first AFC South title in 2002 after realignment. Then the Colts seized control of the division and this rivalry, winning 26 of 32 games and 13 of the past 15. Even when the Titans won their last AFC South title in 2008, they still split with the Colts.\n\nTennessee opened this season by stunning the Browns 43-13 in Cleveland. A win would be the Titans\u2018 first 2-0 start since 2008, giving them an early division lead over the Colts ,who grabbed a playoff berth from them last December in the final game of the NFL regular season.\n\nA win also would show signs of consistency the Titans have lacked for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning to do a lot bigger things than going just 1-0,\u201d Titans safety Kevin Byard said. \u201cWe want to go win a Super Bowl, so that\u2019s something we have to focus on. It\u2019s just another step on trying to go from good to great.\u201d\n\nLuck never lost to the Titans in 11 games before his stunning retirement. Brissett stepped up and rallied the Colts from a 24-9 deficit before losing 30-24 in overtime to the Chargers on the road last week. The quarterback is different, but the Colts haven\u2019t changed what they want.\n\n\u201cThe team that wins this game, it\u2019s going to be a big step, a big momentum maker for the team,\u201d Colts coach Frank Reich said. \u201cWinning the division is the first and foremost goal of most teams, so this goes a long way toward that goal.\u201d\n\nSome things to know about the Colts and Titans:\n\nMAYBE NOT THE QB\n\nBrissett went 0-2 against the Titans in 2017, but Tennessee\u2019s struggles extend beyond just Manning and Luck.\n\nWhen Manning missed the entire 2011 season, Dan Orlovsky ended Indy\u2019s winless season with a 27-13 victory in Week 15 at Lucas Oil Stadium. And when Luck and backup Matt Hasselbeck were both out for the 2015 season finale, Ryan Lindley and Josh Freeman were signed off the street and combined to lead Indy to a 30-24 victory over the Titans.\n\nFULL STRENGTH\n\nTitans quarterback Marcus Mariota wasn\u2019t the only starter missing the last time these teams played. The Titans also were without four-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Jurrell Casey, cornerback Logan Ryan, Walker and tight end Jonnu Smith. All five are healthy, with Mariota coming off his first three-TD game since November 2016.\n\nFLUNKED\n\nAll-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard found all the motivation he needed watching film.\n\n\u201cAn F,\u201d he said when asked to grade his seven-tackle performance in the Colts\u2018 opening loss. \u201cThat\u2019s what I got and that\u2019s what I gave myself because I played terrible. I didn\u2019t play up to the standards I have for myself.\u201d\n\nLeonard has been here before. Last season in his first NFL game, he made nine tackles and recovered one fumble. The next week, Leonard broke out with a stunning stat line: 19 tackles, 15 solo, one forced fumble and one pass defense. He went on to lead the league with 163 tackles despite missing one game because of an injury.\n\nTHE LOOK\n\nBrissett has only logged 19 starts in his four-year career, but he knows all about Titans defensive coordinator Dean Pees. When asked where he\u2019d rank Pees and the exotic looks he likes to use, Brissett said: \u201cNo. 1, for sure.\u201d\n\nThe Titans piled up five sacks, three interceptions and a safety against Cleveland. What makes Pees\u2019 defenses so challenging?\n\n\u201cThey do different things, use different personnel, it\u2019s just tough,\u201d Brissett said.\u201d\n\nTRY A LITTLE PATIENCE\n\nTitans rookie receiver A.J. Brown had three catches for 100 yards in the opener, while Corey Davis, the first receiver drafted at No. 5 overall in 2017, was held without a catch. Adam Humphries, the Titans\u2018 big free agent signee, caught the only ball thrown his way. Davis said the Titans have a lot of weapons and the ball can go to any player on any given week.\n\n\u201cWhen your number\u2019s called, you got to make the play,\u201d Davis said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sport Writer Michael Marot contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.
