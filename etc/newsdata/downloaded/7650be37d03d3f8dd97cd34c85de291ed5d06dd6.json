Obviously he\u2019s not responsible for every revelation; the whistleblower complaint was filed before he lost his job.\n\nBut some mighty high-level leaks are happening and Bolton is known for exacting revenge on his political enemies. The WSJ reported this afternoon that Mike Pompeo was on Trump\u2019s call to Ukraine\u2019s president on July 25, making him a figure of great interest to House Democrats. Now here comes the Times with a new scoop about another \u201crecent\u201d high-level conversation, this time between Trump and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison. And the source or sources in this case somehow knew that the transcript of the call with Morrison was tightly held, with only a few aides able to access it.\n\nThere\u2019s no proof that Bolton\u2019s involved. It\u2019s just an \u2026 interesting coincidence, is all.\n\nReading the Times story, I wonder if the Senate GOP\u2019s strategy on impeachment will be to simply play for time. Investigation-worthy stuff keeps dribbling out and meanwhile Trump himself keeps saying things that risk making his problems worse, like admitting to the media this afternoon that he\u2019s trying to find out who the whistleblower is. Republican senators don\u2019t want to have to vote on, or even comment on, any of this. If Pelosi drags her feet a bit on impeachment, expect McConnell and others to make the argument that we\u2019re now so close to the election that it\u2019d be unfair to deprive voters of the opportunity to issue a verdict on all this in November. Which, of course, is exactly why Pelosi wants to have impeachment done quickly. The sooner the ball is in the Senate\u2019s court, the harder it is for McConnell to claim it\u2019s too late to vote.\n\nThe White House restricted access to the call\u2019s transcript to a small group of the president\u2019s aides, one of the officials said, an unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. Like that call, the discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the extent to which Mr. Trump sees the attorney general as a critical partner in his goal to show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt and partisan origins, and the extent that Mr. Trump sees the Justice Department inquiry as a potential way to gain leverage over America\u2019s closest allies\u2026 President Trump initiated the discussion in recent weeks with Mr. Morrison explicitly for the purpose of requesting Australia\u2019s help in the Justice Department review of the Russia investigation, according to the two people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Barr requested that Mr. Trump speak to Mr. Morrison, one of the people said. It came only weeks after Mr. Trump seemed to make military aid to Ukraine contingent on Mr. Zelensky doing him the \u201cfavor\u201d of helping Mr. Barr with his work\u2026 In making the request, Mr. Trump was in effect asking the Australian government to investigate itself. The F.B.I.\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election began after Australian officials told the bureau that the Russian government had made overtures to the Trump campaign about releasing political damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nNBC confirmed that Trump spoke recently to Morrison about the Durham probe of Russiagate but \u201can administration official described the call as a routine call between two heads of state ahead of state seeking the assistance of another country\u2019s law enforcement agency.\u201d WaPo, meanwhile, is out with its own story confirming that Barr has taken an oddly hands-on approach to the Durham investigation, in some cases flying to countries like Italy to personally solicit assistance with it. Why he would do that knowing how Democrats will exploit his involvement to try to discredit the findings is unclear. The whole point of appointing a respected prosecutor like John Durham to find out how the Russiagate probe began was to try to keep political fingerprints off of it. And now here\u2019s Barr, a figure whom Democrats loathe and have lambasted for seeming way too sympathetic to Trump\u2019s narrative of Russiagate, inserting himself into the process.\n\nBut anyway. What\u2019s tricky about the Times\u2019s report of the Morrison call is that it\u2019s easy to imagine Trump having an improper purpose but hard to see how he did anything improper. It\u2019s natural to believe that the president was concerned first and foremost with himself and his reelection campaign in placing the call. The essence of his approach to life is to look out for number one, always and everywhere; that\u2019s also what makes it so easy to believe that his pressure on Ukraine to open a Biden investigation was motivated by wanting to damage a political opponent, not some abstract concern with corruption by former U.S. officials. But the Ukraine call had shady business surrounding it \u2014 the sustained involvement of Trump\u2019s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was unaccountable to any federal agency, and of course the context of the hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid that Trump mysteriously blocked and only eventually released after pressure from Congress. There\u2019s none of that here. The Durham probe is a legitimate DOJ inquiry and it\u2019s DOJ officials who are involved in it. There\u2019s no hint of Australia being threatened with anything if they refused to assist Trump either. There\u2019s nothing objectively shady about the president asking a foreign head of state to help out the Justice Department.\n\nThe only clue that the White House itself viewed the call as sketchy is the bit about \u201crestricted access\u201d to the transcript. Although Trump would doubtless say that this Times story proves the virtue of restricting that access in the first place: Since the media\u2019s bound to fly off the handle about even appropriate requests, it\u2019s better to just try to keep them secret.\n\nIn other impeachment news this afternoon, Adam Schiff has formally subpoenaed Ukraine documents from Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani told ABC yesterday that he won\u2019t cooperate with Schiff but Rudy says a lot of things that he ends up contradicting later. I\u2019m already gaming out the inevitable sequence of events to come: Rudy refuses to comply with the subpoena, claiming attorney/client privilege; Democrats remind him that he\u2019s already said he wasn\u2019t serving Trump as an attorney in conducting his Ukraine business; Rudy continues to refuse; Democrats hold him in contempt; Trump pardons Giuliani; and then we have a fun Supreme Court fight over whether the constitutional limitation on the president\u2019s pardon power (\u201cin cases of impeachment\u201d) means he can\u2019t pardon *anyone* connected to an impeachment investigation, like Rudy, or whether it merely means that he can\u2019t pardon *himself.*\n\nHere\u2019s Trump digging himself deeper in a hole today.", "description": "\"...shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
