They\u2019ll see it when I rush home to tuck them in!\u201d\n\nThe 39-year-old actress was all smiles as she twirled around in the sexy black number, which had strips of pastel colors through it and was mostly backless, showing off her toned torso. \u201cIt\u2019s all influenced by this tribal beading and I really like it,\u201d said the star, who accessorized with blingy earrings, kept her makeup natural and wore her blond locks in an updo.\n\nBell\u2019s show, The Good Place, was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, while her co-star and \u201cbest friend in the world,\u201d Ted Danson, was up for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\n\u201cWe were Marco Polo-ing while we were getting ready, so I think he seems OK,\u201d she said about how Danson was feeling about the potential Emmy win. \u201cHe, like me, is a people-pleaser, so he wants to make everyone happy, but ultimately I think he\u2019s got to know [that] he\u2019s Ted Danson, whether he wins awards of not. He\u2019s the most talented person we\u2019ve got!\u201d\n\nVALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images More\n\nBell added that it was bittersweet the NBC series will be coming to end after its fourth season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not shocking that our creator made an ethical decision to end the show,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s where the story ends. I think it will please people, but it\u2019s hard for us because we really like working there.\u201d\n\nSee more from the 2019 Emmys below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nEmmys 2019: Live Updates From TV's Biggest Awards Show\n\nEmmys 2019: Billy Porter Talks Nomination and Says 'Authenticity Always Wins' (Exclusive)\n\nEugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara on 'Schitt's Creek's' First Emmy Nominations!
