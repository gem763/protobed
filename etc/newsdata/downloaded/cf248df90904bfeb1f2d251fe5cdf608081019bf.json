But since he has been in office, his Department of Labor has done nothing but harm workers, cutting protections and oversight, turning the DOL into the Department of Employers\u2019 Rights.\n\nHis department recently issued rules that would permit businesses to discriminate against workers on the basis of LBGTQ, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, and other characteristics. It is rolling back decades of labor regulations and protections making his administration the most anti-labor administration in decades.\n\nAs a nation, we must understand that part of what made America great was the promise of the American Dream being extended to more and more people. And no institution in our nation\u2019s history pushed harder for that dream than labor unions.", "description": "Trump has turned the Department of Labor into the Department of Employers' Rights.
