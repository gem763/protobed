We are supposed to leave then. It now looks unlikely that we will, so as you can probably imagine the anger that is building amongst British voters is unlike anything I have ever seen before.\u201d\n\nBREXIT VOTE DERAILED AT LAST MINUTE BY REBEL LAWMAKERS; BORIS JOHNSON PLEDGES NOT TO NEGOTIATE A DELAY\n\nIn a major blow to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, U.K. lawmakers voted Saturday to postpone a decision on whether to back his Brexit deal with the European Union, throwing a wrench into government plans to leave the bloc at the end of the month.\n\nAt a special session of Parliament intended to ratify the deal, lawmakers voted 322-306 to withhold their approval until legislation to implement it has been passed.\n\nThe vote aims to ensure that the United Kingdom can\u2019t crash out of the EU without a divorce deal on the scheduled October 31 departure date.\n\nAs required by law, Johnson sent an unsigned letter to the EU late Saturday seeking a delay to Britain\u2019s upcoming Oct. 31 departure from the bloc, but then sent a signed letter saying he does not favor another Brexit extension.\n\n\u201cMy view, and the government\u2019s position, (is) that a further extension would damage the interests of the U.K. and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,\u201d Johnson wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nBREXIT BREAKTHROUGH? BORIS JOHNSON AGREES 'GREAT NEW DEAL' WITH EU\n\nJohnson has long stated that he plans to take the U.K. out of the EU on Oct. 31 come what may, and his minister in charge of Brexit again emphasized that position.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said Tusk would consult with other leaders \u201cin the next days.\u201d\n\nJohnson is expected to return to Parliament on Monday to keep mustering up support for his Brexit proposal, which was approved by EU leaders on Thursday.\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds of thousands of anti-Brexit demonstrators marched to Parliament Square in London, insisting on a new referendum on whether Britain should stay or leave the EU.\n\n\u201cI think the honest truth of it is, the only likely way we\u2019ve got of sorting this out is to have a general election and to allow the public to show their disgust at these MP\u2019s [Members of Parliament] who stood in the way of Brexit,\u201d Farage said on Sunday. \u201cSo I want there very much to be a general election before too long and then I think we can get some resolution.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen asked if he thinks Johnson can survive, Farage said, \u201cI think he can and I think at a general election, if he holds his nerve, he\u2019d win it.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Julia Musto and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former United Kingdom Independence party leader Nigel Farage, who launched the Brexit campaign in the U.K., said Sunday that the anger among British voters regarding the latest developments with the Brexit deal is \u201cunlike anything I have ever seen before.\u201d", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
