Loughney considered the question for a moment and leaned into the microphone.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSince today,\u201d he replied, before breaking into laughter.\n\n\u201cHow long you been a Nats fan for?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSince today!\u201d pic.twitter.com/i8qPHah0C6 \u2014 Ryan J. Reilly (@ryanjreilly) October 16, 2019\n\nLoughney wasn\u2019t playing a part. He had attended a few Nationals games since moving to the District in 2004, but mostly to socialize. None of them was nearly as exciting as Tuesday\u2019s NLCS-clinching win, which marked the first time he\u2019d sat through a game in its entirety.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe energy was like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced in D.C.,\" said Loughney, who grew up outside of Scranton, Pa., and was never a sports fan. \u201cIt was infectious, so everyone there was just going absolutely insane. I haven\u2019t seen D.C. like that. It can be a little staunch, it can be a little uptight. It was nice to see people be able to let loose.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLoughney went to the game with his boyfriend, who is a huge Nationals fan, and two other friends.\n\n\u201cWe had tickets fifteen rows behind home base, with drink and food included,\u201d Loughney said. \u201cI had to ask a bunch of times, why is he walking? What are the rules? I didn\u2019t understand everything.\u201d\n\nBut he was having a great time, so in the seventh inning, when his boyfriend left the game to check on his sick dog, Loughney stuck around. If not for both of those decisions, he wouldn\u2019t have become the star of a viral video clip that has been viewed 1.2 million times on Twitter as of Friday morning.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve been on camera if he had stayed,\u201d Loughney, whose professional accomplishments include a Helen Hayes Award nomination for his performance in the Keegan Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cThe Full Monty.\u201d \u201cHe would\u2019ve ripped me away, because he knows I would\u2019ve embarrassed myself. I was having the time of my life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTwo minutes after his brief interview with McFly, a friend messaged Loughney on Facebook to say that he had watched it live and predicted it would go viral. Sure enough, by the time Loughney arrived at his Navy Yard residence, a HuffPost reporter had tweeted the clip and it began making the rounds.\n\nLoughney\u2019s truthful, two-word answer to McFly\u2019s question was featured on Wednesday\u2019s episode of ESPN\u2019s \u201cAround the Horn.\u201d \u201cWe should all strive to be as honest as this dude,\u201d Golf Digest opined. \u201cI\u2019ve watched it seven times and it brings me pure joy,\u201d NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Hallie Jackson tweeted.\n\nAD\n\nthis is all of Washington, and 10000% the greatest sound bite of the week. I\u2019ve watched it seven times and it brings me pure joy. https://t.co/Xk0JJAqRPs \u2014 Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) October 17, 2019\n\nOthers inanely and predictably suggested the clip reflected poorly on D.C. and the Nationals fan base, as if there aren\u2019t people who have been following the team since it arrived in 2005, and everyone who didn\u2019t, or who adopted the Nationals after moving to the District, is somehow less of a fan. NBC News analyst Howard Fineman tweeted the video of Loughney\u2019s interview and proclaimed, \u201cThis, ladies and gentlemen, is why America hates its own capital.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, what did I do?\u2019 \u201d Loughney said. \u201cI was honestly just having a good night and that was the first thing that came out of my mouth. People are very passionate about their Nats and sports in general, so I\u2019ve heard a lot, but whatever. It didn\u2019t matter when you were there in the stadium.\u201d\n\nLoughney said his two sports-loving brothers are getting a kick out of his viral fame. A friend suggested he sell \u201cSince Today\u201d T-shirts outside Nationals Park during the World Series. Yes, Loughney is aware the Nationals are in the World Series, and said he will \u201c100 percent\u201d follow the rest of their playoff run.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt this point, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to be such a small part of it. I think [the video] has actually made a lot of people laugh. It was a culmination of a great night, and for the most part, Nats fans are overwhelmingly nice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor a Nationals newbie, Loughney is a quick study. He can already name three players. Well, two and a half.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Howie \u2026 Kendrick,\u201d Loughney said with a laugh. \u201cI heard he did something big in some game, so I heard his name a lot. I don\u2019t know what he did. Then there was Scherzer. And Trea something. \u2026 But if there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned about being a true Nats fan, it\u2019s that you\u2019re supposed to say, \u2018Bryce who?\u2019 I\u2019ve been a fan for two days and that much I\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Local actor John Loughney wasn\u2019t playing a part when he was interviewed outside Nats Park after Game 4 of the NLCS.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
