It was too hard in places, and its broad similarities to Banjo-Kazooie left it wanting next to that all-time classic. It was a good start, but wasn\u2019t the game fans were hoping for, at least partly because of its difficulty, compounded by the intractable problems associated with 3D platform hopping on a 2D screen.\n\nIts sequel moves on from Banjo-Kazooie, drawing inspiration instead from Rare stablemate, Donkey Kong Country. So while Playtonic\u2019s delightful chameleon and bat team remain 3D, along with enemies and level furniture, this is a resolutely 2D side-scrolling platform game. At a stroke that removes the original\u2019s biggest stumbling block, even if there are still moments where the level of challenge is pretty high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed at all is the very British use of sigh-worthy Dad humoure puns. Whether they\u2019ve got worse since Rare\u2019s heyday, or we\u2019ve just got older and grumpier, is up for debate but they\u2019re everywhere, and with the bee-centric subject matter there\u2019s a lot of appropriately weak material to work with.\n\nThat means you\u2019ll be helping Queen Phoebee defeat baddie, Capital B, who has created a thought control device called the Hive Mind that he\u2019s using to steal the queen\u2019s workers, forcing them to do his evil bidding. Your job as Yooka-Laylee is to get them back in order to assemble a bee shield, the Beettalion, a living force field of bees that helps you get through the ferocious final stage intact enough to defeat Capital B.\n\nIn a neat twist, you can actually go and attack Capital B at any time during the game, but without a very substantial bee shield even Dark Souls alumni are going to struggle because the Impossible Lair is not an idly named threat. Each bee in the shield takes a single hit for you, and at its maximum you\u2019ll be able to weather 40 mistakes before restarting. Even with that in place, it can feel like a daunting challenge.\n\nYour job, then, is to explore the game\u2019s open world map, solving environmental puzzles and chatting to the colourful characters you meet while looking for chapters of a book. Each one contains a level that includes a range of secrets and collectibles, as well as one member of the Beettalion right at the end of it. You\u2019ll also be hunting down golden quills that act as the game\u2019s currency, and T.W.I.T. coins, five of which are hidden in each level. You use those to pay Trowzer the Snake (please, make it stop), who unlocks new areas of the map.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final collectible is a range of over 60 different tonics. They confer various powers to Yooka-Laylee, some helpful, some purely cosmetic, and some that act to increase the challenge. For example, one gives you an extra mid-air jump to get you up to previously inaccessible parts of a level, and another adds additional checkpoints. Others make the game black and white or give characters giant bobble heads. One, called Broken Controller, makes left into right, up into down, and R1 into L1.\n\nYou can equip up to three tonics, and many affect the number of quills you can earn. Cosmetic modifiers make no difference, but if your tonics reduce the difficulty, they\u2019ll also constrain available quills, while deliberately increasingly it will give you a small quill multiplier. Unlocking tonics, which are hidden both in the overworld and in many concealed platform areas, is a continual source of surprise and delight.\n\nThe platform action itself is good, even if it doesn\u2019t quite match the joy and accuracy of controlling Mario; Yooka-Laylee\u2019s slightly floppier jumping style never feels quite as exact or predictable. It works just fine though, with Laylee the bat acting as an extra life for the duo. Take a hit and she\u2019ll fly off in a panic. You can often hop about and recapture her before she flitters away for good, but even if that happens there are bells scattered around levels that you ring to call her back.\n\nYooka-Laylee And The Impossible Lair (PS4) \u2013 the top-down overworld is a lot of fun\n\nThe final twist is that each of the game\u2019s 20 chapters has an alternate version triggered by flooding the level, say by diverting a river, or freezing it using a frost berry plucked from a nearby bush. Those modifiers change everything, remaking levels with theme-appropriate extras, whether slippery ice to form new platforms or long underwater tracts \u2013 the latter supplying a pleasant surprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNormally aquatic sections prove clumsy, inadvertently breaking the mechanics that make games interesting. Here they\u2019re beautifully orchestrated, Yooka-Laylee\u2019s underwater dash and swimming stroke are impressive in their precision and ease of control. It makes each flooded section a treat rather than a desperate chore, which is a welcome change from most games\u2019 uneasy relationship with water.\n\nFor fans of the original Rare games, this is a blissful trip down memory lane. Even its level names \u2013 Gasping Glade, Wild Web Woods \u2013 offer a little pang of nostalgia. For everyone else, it\u2019s a quality Donkey Kong Country-esque 2D platform game with far more than its fair share of secrets, and a level of challenge that will certainly keep you busy.\n\nIt may not have the rampant invention of Mario or Rayman at their best, and its puns remain head-shaking, but it\u2019s a highly entertaining platform game at a time when those are in short supply.\n\nYooka-Laylee And The Impossible Lair review summary In Short: A polished, challenging and colourful 2D platform game that recalls the best of Donkey Kong Country on the SNES, even if it doesn\u2019t really move beyond it. Pros: Great level design and platform action. Loads of secrets, a heady hit of nostalgia if you were around for the Rare\u2019s halcyon days, and a level of silliness not often present in modern games. Cons: Yooka-Laylee\u2019s jumps don\u2019t feel as pinpoint accurate as they could be. The puns may be too Dad-grade for some and it\u2019s not exactly bursting with fresh ideas.
