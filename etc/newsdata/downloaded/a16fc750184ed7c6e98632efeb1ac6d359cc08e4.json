He said the goal of the move would be to help defend Iraq and to \"perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps.\"\n\nHe said the sudden withdrawal of US troops could take \"weeks not days,\" and said the president has approved keeping some forces in At Tanf in southern Syria, which has served as a strategic base for training Syrian opposition groups and countering ISIS threats.\n\nEsper did not specify where exactly troops would be stationed in western Iraq, and said he would soon be discussing with allies what the \"next phase of counter-ISIS campaign\" will look like.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has vowed to withdraw US troops from Syria since the last Islamic State stronghold in Syria, located in the town of Baghuz, was defeated in March.\n\nTrump earlier this month abruptly announced that the remaining US troops would soon be withdrawn from northeastern Syria, essentially abandoning Kurdish allies that have fought ISIS alongside the US for years.
