Kin Cheung/AP\n\nChan attributed the poor growth figures to the ongoing protests in a speech last Tuesday.\n\n\"The continuing social unrest has shaken the retail trade, restaurants, tourism and other industries, exacerbating an already-weak economy,\" he said.\n\nThe city's tourism and retail industries have taken a particularly bad hit, he added in a Sunday blog post, noting that:\n\nThe number of visitors into Hong Kong plunged in the first half of October 2019.\n\nAverage hotel occupancy rates have also fallen in the same period.\n\nThe total sales volume among retailers decreased by 25.3% in August, compared to last year, becoming the steepest year-on-year decline for a single month on record.\n\nProtesters in anti-tear gas masks in Admiralty, downtown Hong Kong.

He did not say when these measures would come into force.\n\nEarlier this month Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man, also pledged to donate 1 billion Hong Kong dollars ($127 million) to help local businesses suffering losses as a result of the protests.\n\nThe Hong Kong government withdrew the extradition bill that sparked the protests in September, but demonstrations have continued and become increasingly violent as police and protesters exchange rubber bullets, tear gas, Molotov cocktails, and acid.", "description": "Hong Kong is set to record its second consecutive quarter of economic growth, which is a technical recession.", "authors": ["Sahar Esfandiari"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db82008dee019257f411b74?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
