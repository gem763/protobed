Manchester City 2018-19 player ratings 1/24 Manchester City 2018-19 player ratings How did we rate Manchester City's players and Pep Guardiola during the 2018-19 season? AFP/Getty Images 2/24 Ederson - 8.5/10 Staked his claim to be the Premier League\u2019s best goalkeeper with an impressive second season. Distribution always highlighted, but does the basics of goalkeeping brilliantly too. Getty 3/24 Aro Muric - 7/10 Stepped into Ederson\u2019s shoes for the majority of the victorious EFL Cup campaign and proved to be an able deputy. Getty 4/24 Kyle Walker - 6/10 Not as impressive as last season and, being almost 29-years-old, he is at risk of competition from a fresher, younger model next season. Getty 5/24 Danilo - 6/10 Dependable when called upon, the full-back\u2019s ability to play on either side of defence is also a useful attribute. Getty 6/24 Aymeric Laporte - 9.5/10 Superb. A near ever-present who fits the profile of a Guardiola centre-half perfectly and was adept at filling in a left-back if required. Even scored a number of important goals. Getty 7/24 Vincent Kompany - 8/10 A fine farewell from the club captain. What better note to end 11 years of service on than that goal against Leicester? Impressed during the run-in too. Getty 8/24 John Stones - 6/10 Began the campaign as Laporte\u2019s first-choice partner, yet slipped down the pecking order and was not even in the squad for the Old Trafford derby. Getty 9/24 Nicolas Otamendi - 6/10 Did well last year but lost his regular starting place this season, playing just no more than four consecutive league games. Could return to Spain in the summer. Getty 10/24 Benjamin Mendy - 4/10 A second season spoiled by injury, but whereas Mendy had credit in the bank this time last year, disciplinary issues and questions over his attitude mean he is out of favour. Getty 11/24 Oleksandr Zinchenko - 8/10 Deserves immense credit for stepping in at left-back in Mendy\u2019s absence and rarely letting City down. Guardiola is delighted with the Ukrainian\u2019s dedication. Getty 12/24 Fabian Delph - 5/10 After filling in at left-back so well last season, seemed to lose Guardiola\u2019s trust this year. Seemed to make a costly mistake on the rare occasions he was given an opportunity. Getty 13/24 Fernandinho - 8.5/10 Older than Kompany and deployed in a more demanding role but still consistently excellent. Missed while injured over difficult December. Performance in win over Liverpool a highlight. Getty 14/24 Ilkay Gundogan - 8/10 Easily underappreciated but chipped in with several excellent performances during the title run-in. Tying him down to a new contract would be wise. Getty 15/24 Phil Foden - 7/10 Continued his development with a handful of starts towards the end of the campaign, scoring the only goal in the crucial league win over Tottenham. EPA 16/24 Kevin De Bruyne - 6/10 A difficult year for City\u2019s best player, whose season was interrupted by two serious knee ligament injuries and other niggles. He will be back. Getty 17/24 David Silva - 6/10 The first signs that he is not the force he once was? Silva failed to scale his usual heights and is probably no longer part of Guardiola\u2019s first-choice midfield. Getty 18/24 Bernardo Silva - 9.5/10 Simply brilliant. Always earmarked as a replacement for his namesake, he has surpassed him in the pecking order after a making his influence felt in almost every game he played. Getty 19/24 Leroy San\u00e9 - 7/10 The lows outweighed the highs. Scored a crucial goal against Liverpool but yet to establish himself in Guardiola\u2019s thinking and now faces an uncertain future. Getty 20/24 Raheem Sterling - 9/10 A shining light on and off the pitch, Sterling built on the massive strides he made last season. With Guardiola\u2019s help, he has become one of the deadliest in front of goal in Europe. Getty 21/24 Riyad Mahrez - 6/10 A difficult first year at the club for City\u2019s record signing. The Anfield penalty miss could have proved costly but a goal at Brighton on the final day made up for it. Getty 22/24 Sergio Aguero - 9/10 32 goals in all competitions tells it all. Aguero may now be the wrong side of 30 but he is also more attuned to what Guardiola wants than ever before. Getty 23/24 Gabriel Jesus - 5/10 Previously a rival to Aguero for a starting spot, he is now most certainly an understudy. Difficulties settling down in Manchester may have contributed to patchy form. Getty 24/24 Pep Guardiola - 9/10 Emerged out from a difficult Christmas period to win 14 striaght league matches and win the title. 198 points over two seasons is extraordinary.

Long-term absentee Leroy Sane remains sidelined by injury, too. Guardiola may opt to rest the influential Kevin De Bruyne, who added his eighth Premier League of the season against Everton on Saturday.\n\nDinamo Zagreb have relatively few injury concerns, and could name an unchanged side from the weekend\u2019s 4-0 win over NK Lokomotiva. Mislav Orsic is the danger man for the visitors, having scored five goals in his last four appearances.\n\nPredicted Line-ups\n\nCity: Ederson; Cancelo, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Mendy, Bernardo, Rodri, D Silva, Mahrez, Aguero, Sterling\n\nDinamo Zagreb: Livakovic; Stojanovic, Theophile-Catherine, Peric, Leovac, Moro, Ademi, Orsic, Kadzior, Olmo, Petkovic\n\nOdds\n\nCity 1/14\n\nDraw 10/1\n\nDinamo Zagreb 33/1", "description": "Manchester City host Dinamo Zagreb on Tuesday night looking to build on a strong start to their Champions League campaign.
