with Premier League leaders Liverpool dominating - so who makes the cut alongside Virgil van Dijk and Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne?\n\nAaron Ramsdale - Bournemouth\n\nAsmir Begovic and Artur Boruc were very error-prone for Bournemouth, so Aaron Ramsdale's performances this season have come as a perfect tonic for Eddie Howe.\n\nThe 21-year-old spent the last two seasons on loan at Wimbledon and Chesterfield and Howe thought it was time to give his loanee stopper his chance.\n\nRamsdale, an England U21 international, has flourished and it will not be long before Gareth Southgate calls him up for the senior squad.\n\nAdrian has done well for Liverpool but has still made a couple of mistakes, Ederson, Bernd Leno, David de Gea and Kepa Arrizabalaga the same, that's why Ramsdale gets the nod.\n\nAaron Ramsdale spent the last two seasons on loan at Wimbledon and Chesterfield\n\nRicardo Pereira - Leicester\n\nLeicester have stepped things up a gear this season - and a perhaps-underrated part of that incline comes from Ricardo Pereira at right back.\n\nTireless in defence and a fantastic crosser of the ball, the former Nice and Porto man has also added goals to his game in recent weeks, scoring against Tottenham and Newcastle in successive weeks.\n\nRicardo Pereira is proving to be one of the Premier League's best full backs at Leicester\n\nCaglar Soyuncu - Leicester\n\nYou worried for Leicester when Manchester United prized away the world's most-expensive defender Harry Maguire from the King Power Stadium but Caglar Soyuncu has made the transition seamless.\n\nThe Turkish centre back's calm nature on the ball is ideal for Brendan Rodgers' style of play as the Foxes boss demands his defenders to be comfortable in possession and play out from the back.\n\nThe 23-year-old has plenty of years ahead of him to up his game... further down the line will we end up thinking United signed the wrong Leicester defender?\n\nCaglar Soyuncu's calm nature on the ball is ideal for Brendan Rodgers' style of play\n\nVirgil van Dijk - Liverpool\n\nThe UEFA Player of the Year has picked up from where he left off last season, and the last near-two years since he signed from Southampton, in fact.\n\nVirgil van Dijk's aerial ability was most noticeable against against Burnley, at Turf Moor, where Sean Dyche's side peppered the Liverpool defence with direct balls.\n\nThe Dutch international kept clearing the ball under pressure from Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood, leaving the Clarets duo with nothing to work with.\n\nJoel Matip has performed well alongside him and Liverpool's defence hasn't been as efficient as it was last season - but any injury to Van Dijk would surely put their campaign on a serious wobble.\n\nThe UEFA Player of the Year, Virgil van Dijk, has picked up from where he left off last season\n\nAndy Robertson - Liverpool\n\nVan Dijk's team-mate to his left, Andy Robertson, has been just as integral to Liverpool's fast start this season.\n\nThe Scotland captain has two assists so far this campaign, the same amount at this stage last season when he recorded an incredible 11.\n\nIt's his defensive stability which makes him so reliable for the Reds, his block to deny Sheffield United taking the lead in a tight win at Bramall Lane is fresh in the memory.\n\nLike Van Dijk, if Liverpool lose Robertson they don't have a natural replacement to come in for him.\n\nAndy Robertson has been just as integral as Van Dijk to Liverpool's fast start this season\n\nKevin De Bruyne - Manchester City\n\nEight assists in seven league games tells you all you need to know about Kevin De Bruyne this season.\n\nHe is way out in front of the assist charts with Norwich's Emiliano Buendia and De Bruyne's City team-mate David Silva miles behind in second with four each.\n\nThe Belgian missed most of last season but you can see why he is regarded as the best player in the division by Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville.\n\nYou only have to look at the two matches he didn't start for City this season - the defeats by Norwich and Wolves - to see how important he is.\n\nEight assists in seven league games tells you all you need to know about Kevin De Bruyne\n\nFabinho - Liverpool\n\nJamie Carragher argued that Fabinho is the best defensive midfielder in the league and it's hard to dispute that claim at the moment.\n\nThe former Monaco man has adapted to Jurgen Klopp's pressing demands - something which went against him in the first half of last season when the Liverpool boss was reluctant to pick him.\n\nNow he's an ever-present and the Reds would struggle without him. The only criticism is he seems to tire in the last 10 minutes, but we can't all be perfect.\n\nJamie Carragher argued that Fabinho is the best defensive midfielder in the league\n\nMason Mount - Chelsea\n\nNot even Mason Mount can believe how well this season has gone for the young Chelsea midfielder.\n\nWith four goals to his name already, the 20-year-old has clearly been taking off tips off manager Frank Lampard on where to be in the box.\n\nHis goal against Southampton last weekend was very Philippe Coutinho like - and he would do exceptionally well to emulate the former Liverpool man.\n\nNot even Mason Mount can believe how well this season has gone for the Chelsea midfielder\n\nSadio Mane - Liverpool\n\nLiverpool wide-forward Sadio Mane has single-handedly been tearing teams apart.\n\nJust when the Reds looked like they were struggling against Southampton, Newcastle and Leicester, the Senegal forward puts the game to bed.\n\nA couple of missed chances against Sheffield United aside, he has looked more composed this season which will worry opposition defences up and down the country.\n\nSadio Mane has looked more composed this season which will worry opposition defences\n\nSergio Aguero - Manchester City\n\nIt was just too difficult to leave Sergio Aguero out. Eight goals in eight games, the joint-top scorer in the league, do you really have to say much more?\n\nHe scored in each of City's first six matches, including some big goals against Bournemouth and Tottenham.\n\nYou wonder how many more points City would be behind leaders Liverpool without the Argentine - who has done all that while carrying an injury, too.\n\nSergio Aguero scored in each of Manchester City's first six matches, including some big goals\n\nTammy Abraham - Chelsea\n\nOne of the stories of the season. Dropped for the UEFA Super Cup after Chelsea were thrashed against Manchester United on the opening day, it looked like Tammy Abraham once again might be pushed aside.\n\nBut he's bounced back to be the joint top scorer with Aguero.\n\nAny doubts over whether he could play at this level look to have been quashed. Keeping Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang out of this side is some ask - but Abraham's red-hot form just about does it.\n\nAny doubts over whether Tammy Abraham could play at this level look to have been quashed\n\nBench: Ben Chilwell, Raheem Sterling, Riyad Mahrez, James Maddison, Emiliano Buendia, John McGinn, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.", "description": "The Premier League season might still seem young... but with eight games gone the campaign is closing in on the end of its first quarter.
