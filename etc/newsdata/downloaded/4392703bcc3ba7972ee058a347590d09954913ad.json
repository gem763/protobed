The profile detailed how the fake German heiress, better known as Anna Delvey, conned her way through New York to the tune of $275,000.\n\nThe artist Cynthia Talmadge never met Delvey and had nothing to do with the case. But after the piece was published, she kept getting texts from friends and family asking if she had read it yet.\n\n\u201cA million people sent it to me, and I don\u2019t know what that says about me,\u201d said Talmadge, whose latest piece, \u201cFour Courtroom Outfits of Anna Delvey,\u201d is currently on display in London. \u201cPeople I haven\u2019t spoken to in years said, \u2018You\u2019re going to love it,\u2019 five times a day for a week.\u201d\n\nIt made sense, given Talmadge\u2019s wheelhouse. The artist, who is 30, often turns to the underbelly of polite society for inspiration. She\u2019s recreated the interior of an Upper East Side funeral home known for handling the burials of celebrities like Jackie Onassis, Judy Garland, and Rudolph Valentino, and she has also made replicas of dorms from some of the 1 percent\u2019s choicest psychiatric hospitals.\n\nLike many in New York, Talmadge became obsessed with Delvey\u2019s dramatic trial, especially after GQ reported that the scammer hired a stylist to craft her courtroom looks.\n\n\u201c[With Delvey\u2019s court looks], we saw a really, really tiny crack in the plaster of keeping up appearances, a tiny glimpse into the internal feelings of someone taking part in an incredible public spectacle,\u201d Talmadge said. \u201cMy work is always about that to a certain extent\u2014the tension between the actual experience and everything that goes with keeping up appearances, the feeling of fraudulence that goes into that.\u201d\n\n\u201c [With Delvey\u2019s court looks], we saw a really, really tiny crack in the plaster of keeping up appearances, a tiny glimpse into the internal feelings of someone taking part in an incredible public spectacle \u201d \u2014 Cynthia Talmadge\n\nDespite former fashion editor Anastasia Walker\u2019s best attempt to dress her client in fashion-forward outfits, the clothes she pulled rarely made it to Delvey\u2019s cell in Rikers Island. On certain days, the inmate refused to come into court wearing the standard-issued uniform of black pants and a white shirt. One day, she held up court for over an hour until her presiding judge laid down the law, saying, \u201cThis is not a fashion show.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing drama became tabloid fodder, and Talmadge took note. Four months after sentencing, \u201cFour Courtroom Outfits of Anna Delvey\u201d directly nods at the more colorful details of the trial. Talmadge made a dressing screen with five panels adorned with things like Delvey\u2019s American Express card, shopping bags, the silhouette of the Manhattan courthouse she was ultimately tried inside, and many, many checks (which presumably went unpaid).\n\nThe piece is currently on view in London inside an empty storefront at the Piccadilly Tube stop. \u201cJust make a right when you see the poster for Light in the Piazza at the Regent Streets Stairs, walk past the vacant Pick n\u2019 Mix shop,\u201d and you\u2019ve found the artwork, Talmadge wrote on Instagram.\n\nBehind the screen, Talmadge put in place a machine that shoots up clothing. When viewed from the front, it looks as if someone is furiously getting dressed. Talmadge wanted this part of the installation to run 24/7, but to ensure she didn't \u201cblow up the power grid,\u201d the piece stays powered on from 10:30 in the morning until 6 at night.\n\nThe installation runs until Nov. 24. The mechanics that send snake-printed dresses and black sweaters like the ones Delvey wore flying through the air seems to work well now, though Talmadge admits it had a slightly tempestuous start.\n\n\u201cIt can get hot back there, clothing can get stuck,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole thing is a nightmare, maybe like Anna herself.\u201d\n\n\u201c The whole thing is a nightmare, maybe like Anna herself \u201d \u2014 Cynthia Talmadge\n\nWhen asked why she opted to show her work in London as opposed to the scene of Delvey\u2019s crimes in New York, Talmadge replied that she was mostly drawn to the space provided by her gallery, Soft Opening.\n\nThere are no plans for the dressing screen to come to New York, though that could change. Rest assured, Londoners have followed the case with interest, too.\n\n\u201cShe is a cult figure in London,\u201d Talmadge said. \u201cPeople have read everything, and I think they have a bit of history with her because of their obsession with class. They have their own similar types of people, fake heiresses and things like that. It\u2019s a familiar concept to them.\u201d (Last year, a certain Thomas J. Mace-Archer-Mills, Esquire, who regularly gave televised interviews as a \u201croyal expert\u201d and possessed a mighty posh accent, was outed by The Wall Street Journal as \u201can Italian-American from upstate New York\u201d named Tommy Muscatello.)\n\nTalmadge also believes that the Brits \u201chave us beat\u201d when it comes to tabloids, adding that Delvey\u2019s story was covered by The Daily Mail, Evening Standard, Telegraph, and Guardian. \u201cOur tabloids tend to focus on the film industry and Hollywood figures, and theirs are more society, Page Six kind of things.\u201d\n\nThe artist has not received any critiques from her subject. But Talmadge's work has been tagged on the Instagram page Anna Delvey Court Looks, which once documented the series of outfits she wore to chambers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tagging Anna Delvey in all of my posts about the project,\u201d Talmadge said. \u201cSo Anna, if you\u2019re reading, I would love for you to know about it. I\u2019d be curious.\u201d", "description": "The convicted scammer, accused of stealing $275,000 over the course of 10 months, is the subject of artist Cynthia Talmadge\u2019s latest installation in London.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569562408/10926-Demopoulos-soho-grifter-tease_udp0ez", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
