The investigation, recommended by the commission's safety and enforcement division, came after more than 1 million homes and businesses were left without electricity on Monday, most of those from planned \"public safety power shut-offs\" carried out on an unprecedented scale. The bulk of the shut-offs were implemented by Pacific Gas and Electric Co, a unit of PG&E Corp (N: ), California's largest investor-owned utility, which filed for bankruptcy in January citing some $30 billion in civil liabilities it faced from deadly wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018.\n\nCalifornia regulator to investigate utilities' mass fire-prevention power outages", "description": "California regulator to investigate utilities' mass fire-prevention power outages", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9R1NH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
