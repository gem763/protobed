USA TODAY\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, Gabe Kapler was never a Philly guy.\n\nOh, he loved the city, moving there full-time two years ago when he was named manager of the Phillies, but the fans never loved him back.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t their type.\n\nThey didn\u2019t want some Southern California weightlifting dude who tans naked, eats sprouts and drinks protein shakes.\n\nThey want their managers to drink six-packs after games.\n\nThe only chance Kapler had to survive in Philadelphia was to win.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t.\n\nGabe Kapler had a 161-163 record in two seasons as Phillies manager. (Photo: Eric Hartline, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOn Thursday, Kapler was fired, making it eight managerial openings in baseball.\n\nThe move was made by Phillies owner John Middleton, and not GM Matt Klentak, a high-ranking executive told USA TODAY Sports. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the firing.\n\nKlentak, who hand-picked Kapler, believed that he deserved to keep the job, pleading with Middleton to give him one last shot.\n\nMiddleton didn\u2019t have the patience to wait, not after his free-agent spending frenzy last winter, dropping $330 million on Bryce Harper only to finish with an 81-81 record.\n\nPLAYOFF SCHEDULE: Dates, TV channels for postseason, World Series\n\nSo Kapler is gone along with pitching coach Chris Young, and even the training staff.\n\n\u201cDuring the second half of this season and continuing into this week, I have evaluated our organization extensively, a process that included talking to many people both internally and around the league,\" Middleton said in a statement. \"Reassuring to me was the endorsement that people outside the Phillies gave to the progress we have made recently \u2014 both organizationally and on the field.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, with the knowledge that I have gained from my evaluation, combined with my personal reflection on the 2019 season, I have decided that some changes are necessary to achieve our ultimate objective. Consequently, we will replace our manager.\"\n\nHello, Joe Maddon.\n\nOr welcome home, Mike Scioscia.\n\nAre you ready to lead a team to the World Series, Buck Showalter or Joe Girardi?\n\nMaddon, who\u2019s from Hazelton, Pa., would certainly be the Phillies\u2019 top choice.\n\nYet, according to three people with knowledge of his thinking, Maddon's preference is to return to his roots with the Los Angeles Angels, where he interviewed Monday for the vacancy.\n\nHis second choice is the San Diego Padres.\n\nAnd then the Phillies.\n\nBut money talks, and if someone is willing to give Maddon a five-year, $30 million deal, he\u2019ll pack his RV and be there tomorrow.\n\nThe Phillies job is a fabulous one in a proud city, and Kapler realizes that someone is walking into a great gig.\n\n\u201cWe came into 2019 with very high hopes,\u2019\u2019 Kapler said in a statement. \u201cWe fell short of those, and that responsibility lies with me. The next Phillies manager will inherit a team of talented, dedicated and committed players.\"\n\nKapler, who vowed two years ago when he got the job that he would bring a World Series to Philadelphia, leaves with a 161-163 record, and no playoff appearances.\n\nThe Phillies were the favorites to win the NL East this year, particularly with the additions of Harper and All-Star catcher J.T. Realmuto. They had a 3\u00bd game lead in the division on May 30, 11 games over .500. And collapsed. Once again, just like in 2018 when they lost 33 of their final 49 games, finishing with an 80-82 record.\n\nKapler paid the price.\n\nAnd if the Phillies miss the playoff again, Klentak will be the next to go.\n\nIt was Phillies president Andy MacPhail who said several years ago that a GM gets only so many managerial hires until he is fired.\n\nThis will be Klentak\u2019s second hire.\n\nHe will not be around for a third.", "description": "Joe Maddon, Mike Scioscia and other familiar faces will be targets for the Phillies after firing Gabe Kapler on Thursday.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
