The hit reality singing competition is back after a successful first season. More recently, the network indulged in a bit of confusing, shameless self-promotion at the Emmys when someone in an egg costume joined Samantha Bee and that guy from Workaholics onstage for a lackluster musical performance.\n\nThe Egg is back in The Masked Singer season premiere, wearing a snazzy white suit and Humpty Dumpty mask to perform his rendition of Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cJust Dance.\u201d Egg eventually faces off against a wisecracking skeleton in a top hat who offers a growly interpretation of Otis Redding\u2019s \u201cHard to Handle.\u201d Esteemed reality TV judge Nicole Scherzinger describes the performance as \u201csoulful.\u201d Robin Thicke, of \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d fame, later tells Egg, with complete sincerity, \u201cI applaud your courage.\u201d There\u2019s also a ladybug (who\u2019s most definitely Kelly Osbourne wearing a frightening insect mask), a vintage metallic Christmas tree, and a dog with a six pack.\n\nThe Masked Singer, a South Korean import, is probably one of the most bizarre reality TV shows on air right now (though it admittedly has some steep competition for that title). Essentially, a group of C-list celebrities competes anonymously in elaborate costumes that contain clues about their true identities.\n\nContestants are grouped into pairs and must each perform a live cover of a song. The audience and judges vote on the winners of each face-off, who are safe until the next week, and the losers compete against each other in a \u201csmackdown.\u201d The loser of the smackdown must reveal his or her \u201cfamous face.\u201d Along the way, judges and audience members try to crack clues about the characters\u2019 identities. It\u2019s unexpectedly delightful to learn that an NFL player or Olympic athlete has a secret karaoke talent, and for pop culture junkies, the celeb trivia is irresistible.\n\nLast season, rapper T-Pain won after delivering a moving rendition of Sam Smith\u2019s \u201cStay With Me,\u201d disguised as a furry turquoise monster. Other contestants included Gladys Knight (Bee), Tori Spelling (Unicorn), and Rumer Willis (Lion).\u201d This year, the costumes are somehow even zanier, with celebrities posing as an egg, an ice cream cone, a jacked rottweiler, a penguin, and something called a \u201cthingamajig,\u201d to name a few.\n\nThat the judges are all completely out of touch with pop culture simply adds to the tedious hilarity. Jenny McCarthy, fresh off of her cringeworthy stint as Fox\u2019s Emmys red carpet correspondent, is behind the judges\u2019 table, ready to name drop Donny Wahlberg at any given moment. Like clockwork, an hour into the episode, she notes that Rottweiler sounds like someone who could have toured with her husband, \u201canother boybander.\u201d There\u2019s also Nicole Scherzinger of the Pussycat Dolls, who, as far as I can tell, is the only one qualified to evaluate people\u2019s singing. (She is, on the other hand, abysmal at guessing their identities.) Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong round out the crew.\n\nTogether, they\u2019re surprisingly entertaining. A highlight of the episode was when they speculated that Ice Cream was a famous YouTuber, panicked about how none of them know the names of any YouTube influencers, then struggled to come up with the word \u201csubscriber\u201d for at least two minutes. \u201cFollowers?\u201d Nicole suggested, futilely. Ken Jeong countered with a hesitant, \u201cstreamers?\u201d\n\nThe moment was only made better when Nicole Scherzinger confidently said that she thinks the man who sang \u201cOld Town Road\u201d wearing a giant, bulbous ice cream scoop helmet is Evan Spiegel\u2014billionaire, creator of Snapchat, and husband of Victoria\u2019s Secret angel Miranda Kerr. Prior to this insane suggestion, McCarthy comfortably had the worst guess of the evening when she hypothesized that Ladybug, who sang, \u201cHolding Out For A Hero,\u201d is Willow Smith. After all, nothing screams \u201cFootloose fan\u201d quite like uber hip 18-year-old Willow Smith.\n\nIn the end, it was revealed that Egg was Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir and Ice Cream was Ninja, a person I\u2019ve never heard of before who apparently is famous because people watch him play Fortnite on YouTube. The faces of several kids in the audience lit up in recognition.\n\nThe judges were too busy kicking themselves for guessing that he was either DeadMau5 or Marshmello, even though\u2014as I screamed at my TV several times\u2014 neither of those people has a \u201cfamous face\u201d to reveal because no one knows what their faces look like. Because they professionally wear large, skull-concealing masks not unlike the ice cream head. DeadMau5 would have had to be wearing the ice cream head OVER his massive mouse head for that to make sense.\n\nBut, as I am beginning to learn, this is The Masked Singer, and nothing about it makes sense.", "description": "The hit singing show makes no sense and the judges are all over the place but its impossible to look away from this surprisingly entertaining mess.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569498543/190925-masked-singer-tease_1_jib7kz", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
