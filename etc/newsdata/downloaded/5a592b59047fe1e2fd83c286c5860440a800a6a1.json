In that sense VR versions would be an interesting idea, but beyond the novelty of Nintendo Labo the Switch has nowhere near the horsepower required and Nintendo seem highly unlikely to want to try and sell a \u00a3250-odd peripheral.", "description": "The Monday Inbox tries to decide whether Joel is a ghost in The Last Of Us Part 2, as one reader wants a VR version of F-Zero.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint-ultimate-key-art-01-ps4-us-03may19-4bc7_1570404007.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
