In the full year period ended December 31, 2018, the effective tax rate for the consolidated entity was 16.3%. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, our combined effective tax rate was 22.5%. We believe the latter period is a better representation of the go-forward tax rate, which isn\u2019t very different from the mid-20s tax rate we referenced in our March 12, 2018 8-K when we answered another investor\u2019s question about tax rates following implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
