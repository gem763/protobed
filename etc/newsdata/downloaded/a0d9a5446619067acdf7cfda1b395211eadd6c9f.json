A video replay review revealed that an opponent\u2019s ball called in by the line judge was actually out.\n\nBryan\u2019s gesture occurred in a second-round match that began late Saturday as police, medical personnel, victims and their families were dealing with the fallout of a mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, that killed at least seven people.\n\nUmpire Mariana Alves issued a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct, ESPN reported.\n\n\u201cWhat did I do? Just tell me what I did, real quick,\u201d an irritated Bryan badgered Alves.\n\n\u201cThe gesture that you did,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou did it to the line umpire and did it to me. You [held] your racket like it was a gun. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe penalty is the highest fine to date for the men\u2019s event at this year\u2019s U.S. Open, according to ESPN.\n\nU.S. Tennis Association spokesperson Brendan McIntyre said Bryan\u2019s gesture \u201cwarranted that amount.\u201d\n\nBryan issued a statement Sunday in which he apologized for the gesture.\n\n\u201cI apologize for any offense I may have caused,\u201d he said, according to The New York Times. \u201cWe won the point and the gesture was meant to be playful. But given the recent news and political climate I understand how my gesture could be viewed as insensitive. I promise that I will never do anything like this again.\u201d\n\nBryan \u2014 a six-time U.S. Open men\u2019s doubles champion \u2014 and his twin brother, Bob, won the match involving the contested call.\n\nBob Bryan on Sunday tweeted a message of \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to the people affected by the Texas shooting.\n\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to all our friends in Midland/Odessa.
