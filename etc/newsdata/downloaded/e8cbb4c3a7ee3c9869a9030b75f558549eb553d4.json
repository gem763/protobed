It's clear that publishing gender pay gaps isn't enough on its own.\n\n'Companies must also be legally required to explain how they'll close them.'\n\nSam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: 'Progress to close the gender pay gap is dismally slow and at this rate it will take 60 years to eradicate it.\n\n'Too many women are trapped in low paid part-time work or locked out of non-traditional sectors while others experience pay or pregnancy discrimination.'", "description": "The difference between what men and women earn for doing the same job for at least 30 hours a week has increased slightly to an average of 8.9 per cent - up from 8.6 per cent in 2018.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/11/20320682-0-image-a-103_1572347843903.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
