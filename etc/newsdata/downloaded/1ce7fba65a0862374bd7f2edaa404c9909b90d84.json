McCaffrey's 237 total yards and three touchdowns in the Carolina Panthers' win over the Jacksonville Jaguars was quite a bonanza for fantasy owners, who reaped 47.7 points in PPR leagues.\n\n0: Panthers QB Kyle Allen is the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to begin his career 4-0 without throwing an interception in his first four career starts.\n\n10:6: The Philadelphia Eagles had more sacks (10) than the New York Jets had points (6) in Sunday's win. That sack total fell one short of the team record, which was set against the Cowboys in 1991. Clyde Simmons had 4.5 sacks that day at Texas Stadium. Brandon Graham led the Eagles on Sunday with three sacks.\n\n53: The Houston Texans dropped a 50-burger on the Atlanta Falcons, with the 53 points scored falling just four short of the team record for points scored in a game. While Deshaun Watson threw for five touchdowns on Sunday, he had four touchdown passes in a 57-14 win over the Tennessee Titans in Week 4 of the 2017 season.\n\n3: There have been three 50-burgers so far this season. Starting with the Baltimore Ravens' 59-10 win over the Miami Dolphins in Week 1, and including the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 55-40 win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 4 and then the Texans' win Sunday.\n\n14/217/3: Texans WR Will Fuller had 14 catches for 217 yards and three touchdowns against the Falcons. He is the fourth player in NFL history with at least 14 catches, 200 yards and three touchdowns in a single game, joining Jerry Rice (Dec. 18, 1995), Steve Largent (Oct. 18, 1987) and Jimmy Smith (Sept. 10, 2000).\n\n1,409/12/0: In Thursday night's thrilling win over the Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson \u2014 an early-season MVP favorite \u2014 became the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era with 1,400-plus yards and 12-plus touchdowns passing, and no interceptions, through his team's first five games.\n\n7: With a 26-23 loss to the Arizona Cardinals at home, the Cincinnati Bengals fell to 0-5. This is the seventh time that the Bengals have opened a season 0-5 since 1990, the most in the NFL over that span.\n\n71,923: With 348 yards passing against the Washington Redskins, New England Patriots QB Tom Brady has 71,923 career passing yards, surpassing Brett Favre (71,838) for third-most in NFL history. Brady needs 18 passing yards on Thursday night against the New York Giants to move past Peyton Manning for second place on the all-time list. Drew Brees is the record-holder with 74,845 passing yards.\n\n187: With the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium hosting Sunday's Oakland Raiders-Chicago Bears game in London, it became the 187th different venue to host an NFL game in the league's 100 seasons. The first venue? Douglas Park in Rock Island, Illinois, for the Rock Island Independents' 48-0 win over the St. Paul Ideals on Sept. 26, 1920.\n\n13: Patrick Mahomes was held to his lowest scoring output as the Kansas City Chiefs' starting quarterback in Sunday night's 19-13 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.
