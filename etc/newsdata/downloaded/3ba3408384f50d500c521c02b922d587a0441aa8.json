Resources for users, embedded within the tool, are provided by the American Cancer Society, the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUsers can search for what checkups it is recommended they have -- based on their age and sex -- as well as receive reminders and pointers towards potential, local centers for flu shots.\n\nIf you're willing to let the social network know what tests you've had and which are scheduled, you can use the tool as a form of calendar. Those without health insurance may also be able to use Preventive Health to find Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).\n\nSee also: T\u016b Ora Compass Health data breach exposes medical data of one million people\n\nThose interested in donating blood, too, can sign up to be alerted when blood banks are in need of fresh supplies.\n\nFacebook intends to eventually expand the tool to eventually include other countries.\n\nThe company has a tattered reputation when it comes to user privacy and security, due to a variety of security incidents and scandals, and so Facebook is keen to emphasize that the data, given its extreme sensitivity, will not be misused.\n\n\"Preventive Health allows you to set reminders for your future checkups and mark them as done, but it doesn't provide us, or the health organizations we're working with, access to your actual test results,\" Abnousi says. \"Personal information about your activity in Preventive Health is not shared with third-parties, such as health organizations or insurance companies, so it can't be used for purposes like insurance eligibility.\"\n\nIn an accompanying blog post, Erin Egan, VP and Chief Privacy Officer of Public Policy at Facebook added that activities within Preventive Health will not be made public or shared with other users.\n\nCNET: The 10 best health and fitness podcasts you should listen to\n\nWhen it comes to Facebook access, Egan says that it will only be viewable by a select group of people \"who work on the product or maintain our systems\" and will collect general activity data, such as clicks on particular buttons, to \"understand how the tool is being used in order to improve it over time.\"\n\nFacebook users can choose whether or not to make use of the new tool. If Location Services are turned on via your mobile device, the platform may show you FQHCs based on GPS data, or will do so by your registered city.\n\n\"We don't show ads based on the information you provide in Preventive Health,\" the executive added. \"As always, other actions that you take on Facebook could inform the ads you see, for example, liking the Facebook page of a health organization or visiting an external website linked to Preventive Health.\"\n\nTechRepublic: Does Apple need to choose between consumer and B2B in health?\n\nThis is not the only punt into a new arena Facebook has taken recently. The firm's Libra cryptocurrency project has stumbled with the withdrawal of key partners and regulatory concerns across the globe, potentially placing the firm's plan to expand to support and control financial transactions based on the blockchain in jeopardy.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
