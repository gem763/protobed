He was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center for treatment, where he later died, family members confirmed. (Photo: Family/Facebook)\n\nNewly released police dashboard camera video of the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a traffic stop in 2016 shows the school cafeteria worker telling a Minnesota police officer that he has a firearm, and after a brief exchange, the officer fires several shots into the car.\n\nIn this image made from July 6, 2016, video captured by a camera in the squad car of St. Anthony Police officer Jeronimo Yanez, the Minnesota police officer shoots at Philando Castile in the vehicle during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn. Yanez's backup officer Joseph Kauser is seen standing on the passenger side of the vehicle. The video was made public by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Ramsey County Attorney's Office. (Photo: AP)\n\nThe 10-minute video shows the 4-year-old daughter of Castile\u2019s girlfriend opening the back door of the car and walking into the arms of a second police officer in Falcon Heights, Minn., a suburb of St. Paul.\n\nThe public release of the video Tuesday came four days after a jury acquitted St. Anthony, Minn., police officer Jeronimo Yanez, 29, of second-degree manslaughter and endangering safety by discharging a firearm in Castile\u2019s death July 6.\n\nThe decision set off a storm of outraged reaction on Twitter and protests in the streets.\n\nCastile, 32, a cafeteria supervisor at a St. Paul magnet school, was trying to explain to the officer that he had a firearm in his car when he was shot. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, posted a Facebook video that showed her anguish as Castile bled to death in front of her.\n\nThe shooting drew admonishments from the official sphere, including U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., who said Castile \u201cdid not deserve to die,\u201d and Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, who publicly asked whether the same scenario would have happened if Castile were white.\n\nThe video opens with Yanez approaching the driver\u2019s side window of the vehicle and explaining that he stopped Castile because one of his brake lights is out.\n\nA second officer approaches the passenger side of the car and folds his arms.\n\nYanez asks Castile for his license and registration, and Castile gives them to the officer.\n\nCastile tells Yanez with a slight stutter, \u201cI have to tell you, I do have a firearm on me.\u201d\n\nYanez responds, \u201cOK, don\u2019t reach for it though.\u201d\n\nCastile tries to say something else, and Yanez says, \u201cDon\u2019t pull it out,\u201d then he shouts, \u201cDon\u2019t pull it out.\u201d\n\nYanez shoots seven times into the car.\n\nScreams come from the vehicle as Yanez stands with his gun pointed inside the driver\u2019s side window.\n\nYanez screams, \u201cDon\u2019t pull it out!\u201d\n\nA woman\u2019s voice, possibly that of Reynolds, responds, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYanez shouts, \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d He breathes loudly.\n\nReynolds cries, \u201cOh my God,\u201d and a door opens on the passenger side of the car.\n\nA little girl, Reynolds\u2019 daughter, gets out and walks into the arms of the second officer, who carries her away.\n\nThe video includes an exchange Yanez later had with his supervisor, St. Anthony police officer Tressa Sunde, in which he says Castile was \u201cjust staring straight ahead\u201d after he asked Castile about the location of the gun.\n\nYanez tells the supervisor that Castile was getting \u201cnervous\u201d and that he told Castile to get his hand off his gun. His account of the verbal exchange differs from what\u2019s on the video.\n\nLarry Rogers, a lawyer representing Reynolds, released a statement to The Washington Post saying the video reflected the allegations that Yanez acted irresponsibly.\n\nYanez has been let go from the police force.\n\n\u201cBased upon the release of the dashcam video today, it is clear that officer Jeronimo Yanez was not in control, was nervous and acted in a reckless, willful and wanton fashion,\u201d Rogers\u2019 statement read. \u201cWe are exploring our next steps in light of the compelling evidence of officer Yanez\u2019s wrongdoing that led to this tragedy.\u201d\n\nThough Yanez told Castile he was pulled over for a non-functioning tail light, radio transmissions revealed that Yanez thought Castile resembled a suspect in a convenience store robbery.\n\nYanez\u2019s lawyers did not immediately respond to voice mail messages left Tuesday.\n\nContributing: Dana Thiede and Lou Raguse, KARE-TV\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2tLCyd7", "description": "Newly released police dashboard camera video of the 2016 fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a traffic stop shows the school cafeteria worker calmly telling a Minnesota police officer that he has a firearm, and the officer firing several shots into the car.", "authors": ["Melanie Eversley", "Published P.M.
