It fell short.", "language": "en", "text": "The result suggested that viral disinformation taking root in online political discourse may not always transform behavior at the ballot box.\n\nAD\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, thousands of accounts identifying as part of the online, pro-Trump community spouted conspiracy-tinged, anti-Trudeau invective, often using the hashtag #TrudeauMustGo.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMAGA\u201d was the most frequently occurring expression in the bios of accounts that used the anti-Trudeau hashtag, according to analysis by Marc Owen Jones, an assistant professor of digital humanities and Middle East studies at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Doha, Qatar. The Trump campaign slogan appeared more frequently than did \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cCanadian\u201d or \u201cCanada\u201d in the bios of about 17,000 accounts that tweeted #TrudeauMustGo in a sample drawn from six different periods in September and October. \u201cMAGA\u201d appeared in about 21 percent of the accounts with biographical information. The figure was even higher when factoring in related keywords, such as \u201cTrump\u201d or \u201cKAG,\u201d for Keep America Great.\n\nAmong the MAGA-aligned accounts that engaged in prolific tweeting and retweeting on the #TrudeauMustGo hashtag is one that uses the name Sara Spencer, followed by flags for Canada, the U.S., England and Israel. In the account\u2019s two-year existence, it has sent 82,000 tweets \u2014 an average of about 112 tweets per day. The profile includes images of no humans but rather stock photos of stars and a landscape paired with the text, \u201cIt is time to take back our countries.\u201d The account retweets virulent attacks on Democrats in the United States, including former vice president Joe Biden, and appears to draw inspiration from conservative U.S. media figures, such as radio host Mark Levin.\n\nAD\n\nThe anti-Trudeau chorus intensified as Canadians prepared to vote on Monday. An account with no location and no human picture but thousands of followers \u2014 and whose only biographical detail was \u201cMAGA\u201d \u2014 invoked the anti-Trudeau rallying cry as it posted memes assailing Trudeau\u2019s climate policy. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan also appeared in the bio of an anti-Trudeau account whose other causes included defunding Planned Parenthood and championing Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI.\n\nAD\n\nBecause many of the accounts do not reveal a location, and because even a given location can be fake, researchers have struggled to determine whether the posts flowed from the U.S., as part of an external effort to influence Canada\u2019s vote, or whether they represented the opinions of Canadian citizens who identify with Trump\u2019s politics.\n\nAs illustrated by Monday\u2019s mixed results, in which Trudeau secured reelection even as his party lost the popular vote, the precise impact of the MAGA-inspired fusillade is difficult to measure. As few as a quarter of Canadians use Twitter, according to findings this year.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what motivated different people once they were at the polls \u2014 it\u2019s possible there were people who were motivated by the advocacy the MAGA community was putting forward online,\u201d said Elizabeth Dubois, an assistant professor of communications at the University of Ottawa. \u201cBut certainly we didn\u2019t see a wave of voting support that came along with it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the prominence of the pro-Trump label is a sign of how online discourse in the United States flows across borders, shaping the terms of the debate in other countries. The familiar rhetoric was not limited to the Internet; in the final days of the campaign, supporters of Trudeau\u2019s Conservative opponent, Andrew Scheer, responded to the candidate\u2019s denunciation of the prime minister with the chant, \u201clock him up,\u201d a signature line of attack against Hillary Clinton.\n\nFrom North America to Europe to Western Asia, right-wing causes are enjoying amplification from accounts on Twitter that identify themselves as part of the MAGA movement, researchers have found. Some of the accounts exhibit signs of automated activity that analysts believe may point to coordinated influence operations.\n\nAD\n\nJones said his research suggests the existence of \u201can influence campaign designed to promote right-wing political views at important political moments\u201d \u2014 including, in this case, an opportunity to eject a man once seen as a liberal wunderkind from the prime minister\u2019s office in Canada.\n\nAD\n\nTrudeau gained an unusual, cross-border vote of confidence from former president Barack Obama last week. But a string of scandals, including revelations that the liberal scion wore brownface and blackface years ago, tarnished his image as a tolerant leader and a foil for figures like Trump. The episodes became fodder for Scheer, as well as a far-right candidate, Maxime Bernier, who channeled Trump by inveighing against immigration on Twitter, jolting the country\u2019s decorous political culture but ultimately losing his seat in Parliament.\n\nA spokesman for Twitter Canada did not respond to specific questions about the #TrudeauMustGo rallying cry, instead pointing to recent blog posts about following the Canadian election on Twitter and about the company\u2019s more general election integrity work. #TrudeauMustGo trended in July following the prime minister\u2019s criticism of Trump for telling four minority lawmakers to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries. Some of the accounts were freshly created and posting at nonhuman rates, researchers found, though Twitter said at the time it found no evidence of activity by automated accounts, known as bots.\n\nAD\n\nExperts on bilateral relations voiced concern about the online activity.\n\nAD\n\nGordon D. Giffin, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada under President Bill Clinton, said the participation of pro-Trump accounts in smearing Trudeau was \u201csomewhere between unfortunate and outrageous.\u201d\n\nThe two countries have been the closest of allies, making the clash of their current leaders all the more jarring. Trump has attacked Trudeau as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak,\u201d though he congratulated his counterpart on his \u201cwonderful\u201d victory in a tweet early Tuesday.\n\nAlthough Obama\u2019s decision to endorse Trudeau was unusual, Giffin said, it was \u201cout in the open, based on his personal interactions with the prime minister.\u201d Anonymous actors on social media are engaged in a different sort of enterprise, he said, noting, \u201cit\u2019s interference.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA spokeswoman for the Liberal Party declined to comment.\n\nThe prominence of pro-Trump accounts in conversations about global flash points is not limited to Canada. Analysts say similar activity has supported other right-wing causes, including the effort to extricate Britain from the European Union without a deal \u2014 known as a hard Brexit \u2014 and the push for regime change in Iran.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a global effort,\u201d said Geoff Golberg, the founder of a social media mapping firm called Social Cartograph. \u201cWhether the accounts are Iran-focused or Canada-focused, they\u2019re working toward the same initiative \u2014 boosting flag-bearing nationalist types.\u201d\n\nThe question of origins stumped researchers at McGill University in Montreal, where analysis was unable to confirm that the MAGA-aligned accounts active around #TrudeauMustGo were operated by real Canadians but also couldn\u2019t conclude the opposite, said Oleg Zhilin, the technology lead for the university\u2019s Digital Democracy Project.\n\nAD\n\nSome of the accounts in question exhibited interest in the American election in 2016, but others did not, Zhilin said. \u201cSome were going on about cat photos.\u201d\n\nRecent changes to the Canada Elections Act expanded restrictions on political advertising and cracked down on false statements about candidates. But opportunities for enforcement are lacking when online actors reside beyond the country\u2019s borders. A BuzzFeed News-Toronto Star investigation found that a website called the Buffalo Chronicle was publishing viral \u2014 and debunked \u2014 stories about Canadian politics ahead of Monday\u2019s vote. It is operated from Buffalo.\n\nAD", "description": "The Trump campaign slogan was the most common biographical detail in accounts using the #TrudeauMustGo hashtag, an analysis shows.", "authors": ["Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8rY4x_-dExPJdw7KemZeOkZQ3Po=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/54N53UXU5MI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
