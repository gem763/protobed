From my point of view, if what [the fans] are saying is true and they were struggling to get through then I think that\u2019s an odd thing.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the biggest show and it\u2019s 2019. They can deal with phone calls, surely. A lot of people are angry about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It just seems a bit unusual and it\u2019s just a shame and shock.\u2019\n\nDev and Dianne were eliminated (Picture: BBC)\n\nDianne is still devastated about the results (Picture: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nThe YouTube sensation admitted that he was extremely shocked that his girlfriend Dianne and BBC Radio One presenter Dev were the third couple to become eliminated even though everyone thought they were on track towards the final.\n\nThe star, who is appearing as the Pizza Delivery Boy in Shaun the Sheep: Farmageddon, voted for his girlfriend 10 times over the phone so it\u2019s no surprise he was shocked when he saw the final results.\n\nIf that\u2019s not the ultimate supportive boyfriend move, we don\u2019t know what is.\n\nOn the entire situation, he continued: \u2018I\u2019m confused. It was a real weird situation. I mean, everybody\u2019s been fantastic and it\u2019s an odd show to watch, I think.\n\n\u2018It was weird and such a shock. If you look on social media and the uproar it\u2019s caused\u2026 For me, it was a weird one to watch. It\u2019s an odd show.\u2019\n\nWith Dianne and Dev\u2019s sudden exit, Joe is finding it hard to tell who will even get to the final.\n\n\u2018As last night proved, you just don\u2019t know,\u2019 he continued. \u2018It\u2019s apparently beyond their control. All they can do is dance the best they can and hope, but it\u2019s a real shock.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Joe is getting ready for the release of Shaun The Sheep: Farmageddon, and got to show off his abilities when there isn\u2019t even any speech in the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Without context, you look back and think \u201cI look so silly there\u201d but the more you get it the better it looks. You can\u2019t go half in, you have to just go for it,\u2019 Joe explained when asked about taking voice acting seriously when a lot of it is funny noises.\n\nThe children\u2019s movie has Shaun going on an action-packed adventure with a very mysterious out-of-this-world guest and the two end up having to run away from a dangerous organisation who wants to capture Shaun\u2019s new friend.\n\nShaun The Sheep: Farmageddon comes out in cinemas on 18 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
