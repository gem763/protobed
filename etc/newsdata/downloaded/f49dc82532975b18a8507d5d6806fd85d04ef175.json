This time round, the company behind the scheme, Keplerk, will not sell coupons for Ethereum like it did previously.\n\nThe company behind the idea, Keplerk, will sell coupons valued at \u20ac50 ($55), \u20ac100 ($110), and \u20ac250 ($175) in stores across the country.\n\nIt launched at the start of 2019, but Keplerk had to pull the plug in February.\n\nThe company says it took the decision after some users experienced delays when redeeming their cryptocurrency. \u201cSome people took up to eight hours to receive their Bitcoin,\u201d Keplerk CEO Adil Zkhar said.\n\nSince February, confirmation times have fallen, but it won\u2019t stay this way forever. If this is Keplerk\u2019s reasoning, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the service suspended again, if confirmation times start to increase.\n\nWhile confirmation times were prohibitively high, so were Bitcoin transaction fees. However, according to the report, fees have dropped from 7 percent to 5.5 percent for the \u20ac250 coupon. So it\u2019s a little more attractive than it once was. But that doesn\u2019t make it a good idea.\n\nIt should be noted that each coupon has a 7 percent commission that goes to Keplerk.\n\nThe scheme was announced last November, and was met with criticism from French financial regulator Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (AMF), as you might expect.\n\nThe AMF, Bank of France, and the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority issued a statement after the scheme\u2019s initial announcement that stated the acts of purchasing, selling, and investing in Bitcoin are currently carried out outside any regulated market.\n\nFrench regulators also rightly pointed out that it made no sense to buy a digital asset from a physical store. Anyone can buy cryptocurrency from an exchange desk, and while the transfer fees might be similar, users won\u2019t have to front the additional 7 percent commission.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
