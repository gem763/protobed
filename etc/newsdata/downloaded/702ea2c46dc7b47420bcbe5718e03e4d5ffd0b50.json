Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Florida businessmen, have been under investigation by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, and are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the people said. Both men were born in former Soviet republics. Mr. Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump\u2019s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action\u2026 A Justice Department official said [Attorney General William Barr] was supportive of their work on the case, on which he was first briefed shortly after being confirmed as attorney general in February.\u201d\n\n\n\nFox poll: Record support for Trump\u2019s ouster - Fox News: \u201cJust over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office, according to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday. A new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether. In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don\u2019t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.Since July, support for impeachment increased among voters of all stripes: up 11 points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans and 3 among independents. Support also went up among some of Trump\u2019s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (+5 points), white men without a college degree (+8), and rural whites (+10). Among voters in swing counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016), support for impeachment increased to 52 percent, up from 42 percent in July.\u201d\n\n\n\nPence to release transcripts of his Ukraine calls - AP: \u201cVice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he is working with the White House counsel\u2019s office to release transcripts of his own calls with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pence said records of his two phone conversations would help exonerate President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing. Pence was asked about releasing his transcripts and told reporters, \u2018I\u2019d have no objection to that.\u2019 He spoke after an event in Waukee, Iowa, where he addressed supporters about the president\u2019s trade policy. Pence said he \u2018never discussed the issue of the Bidens\u2019 with Zelenskiy. And he again defended the president, insisting that a \u2018plain reading\u2019 of the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukranian leader shows \u2018there was no quid pro quo.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nPergram: Trump team\u2019s stonewalling speeds up Democrats\u2019 timetable - Fox News: \u201cNext Tuesday is the deadline for most of the House\u2019s requests. That coincides with the day the House returns to session. [Nancy] Pelosi will take the temperature of her caucus when lawmakers return. But in some respects, Pelosi already knows the temperature. Democrats are seething over the administration failing to meet congressional demands. They think they have a robust case against the president when it comes to obstruction of Congress. Pelosi could grant the administration more time to comply. That would let the issue marinate in public for a bit \u2013 and demonstrate that Democrats aren\u2019t hasty to impeach. But after that, the House Judiciary Committee could begin drafting articles of impeachment. Pelosi doesn\u2019t travel roads like this unless she already knows the outcome. She doesn\u2019t lose votes on the floor \u2013 especially something of this magnitude.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s Syria decision affects GOP backing on impeachment - WaPo: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has angered evangelical Christian leaders and Republican hawks, cleaving his political coalition at the very moment he is trying to fortify his standing to survive the intensifying impeachment inquiry in Congress. Instead of enjoying uncontested GOP support as he plunges into a constitutional showdown with House Democrats and prepares for a bruising reelection campaign, Trump is now fighting on two fronts within his party. \u2026 The past few days have tested the bounds of Trump\u2019s Republican support at an unusually frenzied political crossroads that has brought uncertainty for elected officials. While GOP lawmakers have been skittish about directly engaging the subject at the heart of the impeachment debate \u2014 the president\u2019s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart \u2014 many have felt free to loudly condemn Trump\u2019s Syria decision, underscoring the fluidity within GOP ranks.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Ruling: With Syria, Trump lives up to his campaign promise - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains that President Trump removing U.S. troops from Syria complies with his duty to uphold the Constitution: \u201cTrump ran for office promising to bring the troops home. He may have made the latest decision to do so without adequate warning to his military commanders, but his decision is utterly consistent with his promises, and it is utterly in compliance with the Constitution. Now is the time for Congress -- which is largely angry at the presidential use or nonuse of the military -- to repeal both AUMFs and the War Powers Resolution and reclaim its constitutional power as the sole entity in the federal government able to declare war. Until it does, these profoundly outdated, morally ambivalent and overtly unconstitutional statutes lie in the presidential desk drawer like a loaded gun.\u201d More here.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: CUE \u2018I\u2019M JUST A BILL\u2019\n\n\u201cThe President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 69\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: \u2018WHY YOU SHOULD BE EATING MORE CHEDDAR\u2019\n\nWSJ: \u201cFor over 150 years cheddar was the most popular cheese in the U.S. It sustained colonists and Civil War soldiers, and was the foundation for the industrial innovation of processed \u2018American\u2019 cheese. Only recently was cheddar demoted to second place in overall consumption, usurped by that ubiquitous pizza-topper, mozzarella. Though English in origin, cheddar has been part of the American experience from the very start, and today some of this country\u2019s best cheese makers are turning out better cheddar than ever before. Cheddaring, the stacking of blocks of drained curds to extract more whey, creates a sturdy curd suited to aging. \u2026 Commodity cheddar is a publicly traded product whose destiny is frozen food, pre-shredded packs and economy supermarket wedges; specialty cheddar, made on a small scale and sold primarily at cheese counters and gourmet stores, is often preserved in wax or clothbound (wrapped in cotton cloth and rubbed with oil or lard).\u201d\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\n\nBiden: 27.4 points (\u2191 0.6 points from last wk.)\n\nWarren: 25 points (\u2191 2.2 points from last wk.)\n\nSanders: 14.6 points (\u2193 1.4 points from last wk.)\n\nButtigieg: 5.6 points (\u2193 0.4 points from last wk.)\n\nHarris: 4.6 points (\u2193 1 point from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: Quinnipiac University, IBD, Monmouth University, Fox News and NBC News/WSJ.]\n\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\n\nAverage approval: 42.4 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 53.8 percent\n\nNet Score: -11.4 percent\n\nChange from one week ago: \u2193 0.4 points\n\n[Average includes: Fox News: 43% approve - 55% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Monmouth University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

It came after days of privately huddling with advisers.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders retracts statement about slowing down campaign - NBC News: \u201cSen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday tamped down speculation that he would slow his presidential campaign after he suffered a heart attack last week, saying he plans to compete as vigorously as ever for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The Vermont independent told NBC in an exclusive interview airing Wednesday night on \u2018Nightly News\u2019 and Thursday on the \u2018Today\u2019 show that his health scare has only strengthened his resolve, despite telling reporters a day earlier he planned to curtail his normally packed schedule. \u2018I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,\u2019 Sanders said during the interview alongside his wife, Jane Sanders. \u2026 He added, \u2018I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren refreshes vow against high-dollar fundraisers - Politico: \u201cSen. Elizabeth Warren said she will continue to swear off high-dollar campaign fundraisers in the general election if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, extending her self-imposed ban on the events beyond the primary and reversing an earlier statement. \u2018When Elizabeth is the Democratic nominee for president, she\u2019s not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,\u2019 campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement Tuesday, which Warren later amplified in a Twitter thread. \u2026 That broad statement worried some Democrats, as the party\u2019s presidential nominee traditionally has been a big fundraiser for other candidates and Democratic committees. But in a Wednesday statement, Orthman clarified that Warren's pledge would apply only to her presidential campaign, not to raising money for the Democratic Party or other candidates.\u201d\n\n\n\nTEAM TRUMP GOING ALL OUT FOR MINNESOTA, YOU BETCHA\n\nNYT: \u201cA Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M. Nixon\u2019s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent\u2026 This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory\u2026 Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign\u2019s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100.\u201d\n\n\n\nLOUISIANA GOVERNOR RACE HEATS UP IN CLOSING DAYS\n\nPolitico: \u201cThe last televised primary debate in Louisiana saw Republicans Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone go after [Democratic Gov. John Bel] Edwards \u2014 but also each other, as they seek a second-place finish in an uncertain runoff. Rispone took the opportunity to post a question to Abraham, asking why he promised to donate his congressional salary but later stopped doing so, while Abraham criticized Rispone for his past support of Common Core. The two also argued back and forth about each other\u2019s records, with Abraham accusing Rispone of running \u2018distasteful\u2019 attack ads, and Rispone calling Abraham\u2019s line of attack on Common Core \u2018an outright lie.\u2019 The pair of Republicans did train their fire on Edwards, too. They hit him over the state\u2019s economy and needled him on why he backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 an attempt to nationalize the race, with President Donald Trump, who\u2019s been tweeting proflicially about the race, planning an election-eve visit to Lake Charles on Friday night.\u201d\n\n\n\nMcGrath raises $10.7 million in campaign to oust McConnell - WashTimes: \u201cDemocrat Amy McGrath raised a record $10.7 million in the last three months for her bit to topple Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate race in Kentucky. Ms. McGrath, a Marine fighter pilot, is the leading Democratic candidate in the race to take on Mr. McConnell, a six-term senator who is immensely unpopular in his home state. The $10.7 million that Ms. McGrath raised in the third quarter came from 299,000 donors with an average individual contribution of $36. \u2018Mitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations \u2014 from all 120 Kentucky counties \u2014 have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,\u2019 said McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas.\u201d\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nWatch this: Neil Cavuto: We are not as opposite from one another as we think - Fox News\n\n\n\nMegan McArdle: What\u2019s behind the rise of radicalism? - WaPo\n\n\n\nRep.

Woah, woah, woah! Can we please get an emergency podcast to discuss the new Fox News poll that has 51% of Americans supporting impeachment and removal? This seems crazy, yet not entirely surprising!\u201d \u2013 Katie Hacker, Evington, Va.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: I don\u2019t know if we can manage that one, Ms. Hacker, but how about a little Bleacher banter? It may be best here to look at our excellent pollsters\u2019 work in context. If you check out FiveThirtyEight\u2019s very helpful averages on the subject, you\u2019ll see that support for impeachment has been on a sharp increase. On the day when the news broke that the President Trump had sought help from the Ukrainian president in getting dirt on the Bidens, opposition to impeachment ran 11 points ahead, 51 percent to 40 percent. That was in mid-September. Today, the average stands at 49 percent in favor of impeachment and 43 percent opposed. Support among Democrats and independents has jumped 10 points or more while Republicans increased a more modest, but still significant, 4 points on average. The takeaway from our poll and every other credible pollster is that the tide has turned decisively against the president. There is still a long way to go here and public opinion on this subject is obviously malleable. But if more than 80 percent of Democrats are already on board, it\u2019s hard to see that number declining much any time soon. That means Team Trump\u2019s urgent work is to convince increasingly skeptical independent voters that the president deserves to remain in office. It won\u2019t be enough to count on the anger of core Republican supporters.]\n\n\n\n\u201cI've been following your continued response to readers who stubbornly insist on asking for a crime worthy of impeachment. Your response is that it's not a legal issue but a political issue. As a devotee of the U.S. Constitution, I really think that your reading of the \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019 standard should actually read \u2018high crimes, misdemeanors, and anything else the U.S. House of Representatives feels adequate to the occasion\u2019 would be more of a support for your position. But, alas, such language seems to be missing. Or am I reading the wrong U.S. Constitution? Please advise.\u201d \u2013 Bill Panagakos, Littleton, Colo.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: It may be helpful here to look at the intent of the Framers in devising the vehicle. Here\u2019s what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 about the purpose of impeachment: \u201cThose offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d The phrase \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d was a term of art long before the Constitution was drafted. As Hamilton alludes to in the passage above, the \u201chigh\u201d in the term refers to the office more so than the offenses. The purpose of impeachment isn\u2019t to prosecute federal officials for crimes, but rather to remove them from office for abusing their powers and breaching the public trust. The Framers were following in the footsteps of British politician and political philosopher, Edmund Burke. In his famous speech in 1786 seeking the impeachment of the governor general of India, Warren Hastings, for self-seeking, tyrannical treatment of the crown\u2019s Indian subjects Burke declared \u201cthe principles of honor, the spirit of cavaliers to govern here; not the low principles of jurisprudence only.\u201d Hastings\u2019 scandal and trial were very much on the minds of Americans during the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and Burke\u2019s view \u2013 that \u201cprinciples of honor\u201d were essential to consider \u2013 was the mainstream opinion on this side of the Atlantic. This is why the Senate, not the Supreme Court or some bicameral commission, was chosen to sit in judgment. Here\u2019s Hamilton again: \u201cThe prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.\u201d Sound familiar? The Senate, then indirectly elected by state legislatures, with its members serving six year terms, was seen as the best home for dispassionate, fair-minded evaluations of the facts at hand without the unpleasant thought of unelected judges removing an elected president. The House, more easily incited to partisan passion and more responsive to the immediate will of the electorate, can prosecute, but the upper chamber runs the show. Whether or not you agree with their assessment, if a majority of the members of the House believe that the president has abused his office for personal gain and should be removed, they would be entirely within the American understanding of an impeachable offense. Just as it would be within that tradition for the Senate to reject their claim if its members so choose. This is how the system is supposed to work. I imagine that Democrats will end up correlating their articles with existing criminal offenses, like the solicitation of campaign help from foreign countries and obstruction, but that\u2019s just window dressing. Appeals to honor and ethics are enough.]\n\n\n\n\u201cRe: your report on Trey Gowdy joining Team Trump. Is he betting all his chips on a series of events that would get him a Supreme Court nomination?\u201d \u2013 John Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: I wouldn\u2019t get too far ahead of myself on this one. Gowdy\u2019s friend and longtime fellow South Carolina Congressman Mick Mulvaney is the White House chief of staff. Gowdy is arguably the best suited man in America to go up against House Democrats in this matter. He has a strong reputation among Republicans but still enjoys some credibility among his former Democratic colleagues for his successful navigation of efforts by Trump loyalists to torch the FBI. And if anything, running point on a matter this explosively controversial and rankly partisan would diminish, rather than improve, his chances of being picked for the Supreme Court.]\n\n\n\n\u201cChris and Brianna, Please tell me you took editorial liberty in quoting Federalist No. 30 and that Alexander Hamilton did not write in all caps. My image of the esteemed first Secretary of the Treasury will be forever marred if he was a precedent Twitter troll.\u201d \u2013 Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Capitalization is a funny thing. We\u2019ve only really had standard practices for the past century or so. Certainly back in 1787, it was highly irregular across the English-speaking world. If you look at our founding documents you\u2019ll see that in those days, for example, it was conventional to capitalize nouns in the way modern German speakers do. Consider the American creed: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d As you can see, the capitalization of nouns isn\u2019t even standard. Why \u201cRights\u201d but not \u201cmen?\u201d \u201cLiberty\u201d but not \u201ctruths?\u201d What comes through is that capitalization was a form of emphasis, not grammatical rules. The capitalized words after the start of the sentence \u2013 \u201cCreator,\u201d \u201cRights,\u201d \u201cLife,\u201d \u201cLiberty\u201d and \u201cHappiness\u201d \u2013 actually make for a kind of semaphore for the actual meaning of the sentence. The essence is there in those five key words. So yes, I\u2019m sorry to break it to you that ALL CAPS was a thing before Twitter. And you can just imagine Hamilton, eyes and pen aflame responding to the opponents of the Constitution: \u201cIN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.\u201d There\u2019s no record of whether Patrick Henry wrote back \u201cu mad bro?\u201d]\n\n\n\nShare your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\n\n\nWHAT I LEARNED IN CHICK-FIL-A TRAINING IS\u2026\n\nWBNS: \u201cA Chick-fil-A employee went above and beyond to help a customer having a bad day.
