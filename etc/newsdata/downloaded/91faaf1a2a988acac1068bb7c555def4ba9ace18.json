The proposed rule would require that appropriate quota reductions be made after estimating the potential for pills to be sold illegally.\n\nThe proposal comes after an internal watchdog report showed the agency allowed drugmakers to increase production of opioids even as overdose deaths were skyrocketing.\n\nAccording to the report, the DEA permitted drugmakers to increase their production of oxycodone, a highly addictive painkiller, by 400 percent between 2002 and 2013.\n\nThe DEA didn't substantially cut the quota until 2017, when opioid overdose deaths reached a peak in the U.S.\n\nUnder the proposal, the diversion potential would be based on rates of overdose deaths and abuse, the overall public health impact related to specific controlled substances and may include other factors as appropriate, the agency said.\n\nThe proposal would also implement provisions of the Support Act, legislation passed last year to address the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\nThe proposed rule seeks to introduce \u201cuse-specific\u201d quotas, which would include quantities of controlled substances for use in commercial sales, product development, packaging/repackaging and labeling/relabeling or replacement for quantities destroyed.", "description": "A new policy from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) aims to improve the agency\u2019s quotas of controlled substances, with the intent of preventing manufacturers from overproducing opioids.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/opioids_102017getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
