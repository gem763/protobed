The reason was due to there being too many producers on the series with the Television Academy forcing Kaling to prove that she deserved recognition.\n\n\u201cThey made me, not any of the other producers, fill out a whole form and write an essay about all my contributions as a writer and a producer. I had to get letters from all the other male, white producers saying that I had contributed, when my actual record stood for itself,\u201d she said. Kaling was added to the list of producers despite The Office not winning the award.\n\nThe Television Academy responded to the comments with a statement sent to The Los Angles Times.\n\n\u201cNo one person was singled out,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThere was an increasing concern years ago regarding the number of performers and writers seeking producer credits. At the time the Producers Guild worked with the Television Academy to correctly vet producer eligibility. Every performer producer and writer producer was asked to justify their producer credits.\u201d\n\nKaling responded to the statement on Twitter in multiple tweets.\n\n\u201cRespectfully, the Academy\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t make any sense. I was singled out. There were other Office writer-performer-producers who were NOT cut from the list. Just me. The most junior person, and woman of color. Easiest to dismiss. Just sayin\u2019,\u201d Kaling said.\n\n\u201cI worked so hard and it was humiliating. I had written so many episodes, put in so much time in the editing room, just to have the Academy discard it because they couldn\u2019t fathom I was capable of doing it all. Thankfully I was rescued by my friends, the other producers,\u201d she continued.\n\n(2) But I worked so hard and it was humiliating.

I was the 1st woman of color nominated for writing a comedy script. Why not say \u2018years ago we prevented a deserving woman of color from getting credit for her accomplishments. We\u2019re sorry and it would never happen now,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nHey, @TelevisionAcad! I have been a proud member for years.
