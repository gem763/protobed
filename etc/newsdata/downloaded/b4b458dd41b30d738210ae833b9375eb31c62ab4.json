Photo: Getty Images\n\nAs the FBI continues to investigate the crimes of late billionaire and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, the bureau is now taking a closer look at the allegations against Epstein\u2019s friend, Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew, the Times of London reported this weekend.\n\n\u201cThe US investigation is focusing on several potential victims in the hope that they can provide more details about Prince Andrew and his connection to the Epstein case,\u201d a source from the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI, told the Times.\n\nThe queen\u2019s son and the deceased financier had been friends since the early 1990s, according to the Guardian, and Prince Andrew has been heavily implicated in the Epstein case. One of Epstein\u2019s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, has said that Epstein forced her to have sex with the prince on three separate occasions when she was underage. There is also an ever-growing mountain of evidence of the two men\u2019s close relationship \u2014 pictures of them at the same Mar-a-Lago party with Donald Trump in 2000; video of the prince at Epstein\u2019s mansion in 2010; an account of the two men getting foot massages together from \u201ctwo young well-dressed Russian women\u201d in 2013, two years after Epstein was released from prison in an absurdly lenient plea deal for charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution.\n\nThe prince has repeatedly and emphatically denied the allegations against him, but Buckingham Palace is reportedly taking the claims \u2014 or, more accurately, the optics of the claims \u2014 more seriously. So seriously, in fact, that the prince cut short his golf vacation in Spain this summer.\n\nDai Davies, the former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard who had been in charge of Prince Andrew\u2019s protection in the late 1990s, told the Times that an investigation into the claims against the royal is in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d as well as the prince\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI would have thought it\u2019s in Prince Andrew\u2019s interests to clear this matter up. Any residue of doubt or innuendo should be cleared up by a clear, unequivocal, structured investigation,\u201d Davies said.\n\nStay in touch.
