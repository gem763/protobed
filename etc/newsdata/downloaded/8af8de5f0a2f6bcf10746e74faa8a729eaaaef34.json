The first was that a doctor who had recently traveled to Uganda had returned to Tanzania with a \u201csuspected\u201d case of Ebola. Testing performed by the Tanzanian National Health Laboratory reportedly indicated that the doctor was positive for the virus. She died on September 8 in Dar es Salaam, the largest city in Tanzania, after traveling extensively throughout the country. Subsequent unofficial reports to the WHO indicated that there were several other suspected cases as well as contacts in quarantine in various sites in Tanzania.\n\nThe Tanzanian government has said that there have been no cases of Ebola and that no suspected cases are \u201cadmitted anywhere\u201d in the country. But officials there have been remarkably slow to respond to the WHO\u2019s requests for information, have failed to provide critical details about the cases, have not offered alternative explanations for the illnesses and death, and have refused to perform confirmatory tests to ensure that the disease is not spreading, according to the WHO.\n\nWhile the WHO ultimately determined that there is too little information to justify travel and trade restrictions at this point, US and UK government officials are now warning travelers of the possibility that the virus is spreading unchecked in the country.\n\nThe US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department updated their travel advisories for Tanzania late Friday, September 27.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s warning briefly summarizes the situation outlined by the WHO, noting that the doctor who died had a \u201cprobable\u201d case of Ebola, and that she had traveled through several cities, including Songea, Njombe, and Mbeya.\n\nThe agency warned that \u201ctravelers should remain aware of the situation and avoid direct contact with people who are ill, when possible. They should also monitor themselves for symptoms of EVD [Ebola virus disease] (fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, unexplained bruising or bleeding) both during and for 3 weeks after travel.\u201d\n\nThe State Department likewise suggests that people visiting Tanzania \u201cexercise increased caution.\u201d Its warning was more concise, but it still called the doctor\u2019s death a \u201cprobable\u201d case of Ebola.\n\nAs noted by STAT news, the UK government also updated its travel advice to warn of the possibility of Ebola in Tanzania.\n\nThe UK\u2019s warning notes that the WHO declared the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in July and that cases have spilled over to Uganda.\n\nThe outbreak, which began in August of 2018, has sickened over 3,000, killing more than 2,000 so far. It is the second largest Ebola outbreak on record, surpassed only by the 2014 West African outbreak involving more than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths.", "description": "Travelers should stay informed and avoid contact with sick people, CDC says.", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1149676893-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
