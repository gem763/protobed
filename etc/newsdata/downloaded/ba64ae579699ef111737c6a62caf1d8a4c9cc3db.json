The incident soon involved pitcher Jason Vargas threatening to knock the reporter out in defense of Callaway.\n\nThe Mets\u2018 season was not entirely dysfunctional, however. Rookie Pete Alonso led the majors with 53 home runs, breaking Aaron Judge\u2019s record for most home runs hit by a rookie, and the team as a whole came on in the second half of the season.\n\nBut many fans wanted Callaway out, and it was long rumored that he wouldn\u2019t last to the end of his three-year contract with New York.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
