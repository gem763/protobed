This handful equates to 100g of flour per egg.\n\nStep 1: Weigh out your ingredients\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAllow 100g of 00 flour (or plain flour) per person for a main course-sized portion. You need 55g of egg without its shell for every 100g of flour. For example, if you are making pasta for four people, you will need 400g of flour and 220g of egg, which most of the time will mean four hen eggs. But weighing out your ingredients means you can also use other eggs, such as duck or turkey, which is something the nonne do.\n\nIf your eggs are on the small side, add a bit of water or another egg yolk to bring the quantity up to the right weight. If your weight is slightly over, use the eggshell to scoop out excess egg white.\n\nStep 2: Mix them together\n\nTip the flour onto your board in a heap. Use your fingers to make a well in the centre, making sure it\u2019s not too wide or the rim too low, otherwise your egg mix will overflow. Pour the eggs into the well. Take a fork (or use your fingers) and scramble the eggs together. They are mixed sufficiently when you lift the fork and you have a homogeneous, non-clumpy looking liquid that falls smoothly from your fork.\n\nDraw your fork around the inside of the flour wall, so a small quantity of flour falls into the egg mixture. Whisk it in, smooshing any lumps, so you gradually create a batter. Repeat until you have a mixture that won\u2019t run all over the board. At this point, you can cave in the flour walls and mix in the rest of the flour with a bench scraper by scraping the flour inwards and over the batter. Of course, you can beat the egg and flour together in a bowl, even with a food mixer, but it\u2019s not as fun.\n\nMop up any flour with your dough and give it a quick knead. If it is sticky, add a tablespoon of flour and knead it in. It is better to adjust your dough now than later.\n\nIf it is not sticky and you have some flour on the board, scrape off the excess, so you have a nice clean board to knead your dough. Nonne sieve any excess flour and reuse it. The dough should feel soft and pillowy, but not too sticky.\n\nStep 3: Knead the dough\n\nKnead the dough for 10 minutes minimum. Think of your hands as waves: the heels of your hands push the dough away from you, while your fingers pull it back. Once your dough has become a log, turn it 90-degrees and fold in half and continue kneading. You want to work at a brisk pace, as air is the enemy of decent pasta \u2013 it will dry it out, so don\u2019t dawdle.\n\nIf the pasta feels too dry, damp your hands with water to put moisture back into the dough. Kneading develops the gluten and elasticity of the dough. Your dough should feel silky and smooth. When you press your thumb into the dough, it should bounce back. Some nonne judge their dough to be done when they can see small holes in the dough if sliced through the middle. To knead, you can also use a dough hook on your food mixer.\n\nStep 4: Leave the dough to rest\n\nAt this point, place the dough in a lidded bowl and cover it to stop it from drying out. Cling film is good too, but you may not want to use it. You can also use a tea towel, but it\u2019s important it hasn\u2019t been washed with perfumed detergent as this will add an odour to your pasta. Leave the dough at room temperature for 30 minutes. This relaxes the gluten and makes it easier to roll out. You can also leave it in the fridge overnight.\n\nThe colour will darken, but it will taste the same. It\u2019s important to bring the pasta back to room temperature before you try rolling it.\n\nStep 5: Roll out the dough\n\nBefore you start, remember to keep your pasta floured throughout the process. Cup your hands over your rolling pin so your wrists nearly touch the pasta board. Flatten your dough with your pin, turning it a few degrees at a time in the same direction; this helps to keep it circular.\n\nWhen it is the size of a plate, start with your hands at hip-width and roll the top third of your dough (furthest away from you) by following the curve of the circle and drawing your hands inwards as you push the pin away from you. Your hands will meet in the middle. Stop the pin before it reaches the very edge. Roll the dough four times. Turn the pasta from 12 to one and repeat going round the clock.\n\nYou will end up with a bump of pasta in the middle. To get rid of it, flip the outer edge of pasta over the pin. Hold the pasta with one hand, and place the other hand on the dough to stop it moving. Give the pin a tug with the pasta hand to create a snug fit around the pin. Roll the dough over the pin towards you. Move your hands wider, stick your elbows out and, pressing down, roll the pasta out two or three times. This will flatten the thicker central zone of your pasta. Finish with the pasta rolled up and turn it 90 degrees, opening it out across the board.\n\nRepeat this process until the sfoglia (the pasta sheet) is too large to move comfortably by hand. At this stage, you will need to roll it up around the pin and turn it, as described above. Allow your pin to roll on its own across the dough to remove any air after you have turned it. You can let your sfoglia drape over the edge of the board \u2013 allow about a third, no more, otherwise the whole thing will slip off. This helps to anchor and stretch it, but also it means you don\u2019t have to stretch too far over the board, messing up your back. Remember not to lean against the pasta.\n\nDo not attempt to roll the entire sheet (until you feel expert) or change rolling direction; just keep rolling the outer third directly in front of you. As the dough gets bigger, your arms and elbows start quite far apart. Eventually, you will end up with pasta you can see through. It should feel like heavy linen.\n\nTo check your pasta is evenly rolled, roll up a third, hold onto the edges (it will fall off the pin otherwise) and hold it up to the light. Darker patches mean thicker dough and you haven\u2019t rolled it uniformly, so you will want to go back over these areas. Leave your pasta sheet to dry on the board for 5 minutes. For tagliolini, tagliatelle and pappardelle, you can now flour it, roll it up very gently (like a carpet) into a log and it\u2019s ready for cutting.\n\nHow to make durum wheat dough\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at durum wheat flour and water-based dough. This dough doesn\u2019t include eggs (usually) as durum wheat already has enough bite. The resulting dough won\u2019t be as stretchy as an egg-based dough made from 00 flour. This type of dough is used for all the pasta shapes you find in southern Italy such as cavatelli and maccheroni and orecchiette. When you make a sfoglia, it\u2019s always slightly thicker and the pasta ribbons you can make from it include sagne ritorte and taccune.\n\nStep 1: Weigh out your ingredients\n\nAllow 45-50g tepid water for every 100g semola rimacinata (semolina flour). Incidentally, the volume of the water is the same as the weight: 45-50ml, but scales are more accurate than measuring jugs. Add 4g (1tsp) salt to a litre warm water. Salt is not there for flavour; it helps to make the gluten strands slide along one another better.\n\nStep 2: Mix them together\n\nEither use a bowl or heap the flour onto your board. Using your fingers, make a well and pour in the amount of water you need. Mix the flour into the water, making sure you mop up all the excess flour.\n\nStep 3: Knead the dough\n\nKnead the dough, as described for the egg pasta (see above), for 5 minutes. You want a dough that is silky and not sticky to the touch. It won\u2019t have the soft pillowy feel of egg-based pasta dough, but it will feel nice and plastic \u2013 and you can use it immediately, there\u2019s no need to leave it to rest. If you knead the dough for longer, it will develop some elasticity and then you will have to let it rest for 20 minutes or so.\n\nStep 4: Shape the dough\n\nRoll the dough if necessary (lots of southern Italian pasta shapes don\u2019t require the dough to be rolled out). Keep the dough covered while you are making the pasta shapes to stop it drying out.\n\nLuigia\u2019s manata with chickpeas\n\nFor 6 people\n\nManata is a ribbon pasta, found in the Castelmezzano area of Basilicata. It uses a very interesting method to make it, which doesn\u2019t involve rolling out a sfoglia first. Its name changes depending on where you are in southern Italy \u2013 down the road in the village of Ginestra it\u2019s called dors in the local dialect. Luigia has a ready laugh and isn\u2019t at all fazed being filmed in a local restaurant. She says: \u201cI was part of a large family and we had to make pasta \u2013 we couldn\u2019t afford to buy it.\u201d Squeezing and stretching the dough, she creates a kind of short tagliatelle, which she then serves with a simple chickpea and tomato condiment. \u201cThis is a typical way to serve this pasta,\u201d she says.\n\nFor the pasta\n\n400g semolina flour\n\nPinch of salt\n\n180-200ml water\n\nFor the chickpea and tomato sauce\n\n3-4tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n\n1 onion, chopped\n\n300g cooked tin or jarred chickpeas\n\n300g passata\n\n1tsp salt\n\nHandful of fresh basil leaves\n\nExtra virgin olive oil, to drizzle\n\nMake the durum wheat pasta dough as described. The easiest way to describe how to make manata ribbons is to refer you to Luigia\u2019s video on the Pasta Grannies channel on YouTube. But if you don\u2019t have access to the Internet, here goes...\n\nOnce your dough has rested, press it into a slipper shape. You want to make a ring of pasta: use a sharp knife to slice down the middle to create a horizontal slit all the way through the dough. Using the palms of your hands, gently widen the slit and rotate the dough round, shaping it into a ring. Keep rolling and working the dough around the circle, to increase its circumference and thin out the dough. Keep going until you have a smooth rope which is about 1cm in diameter. Then, channelling your childhood rodeo cowboy dreams, loosely loop the rope around one hand about six times.\n\nHold the coiled rope in both hands, palms up. Decide which is your squeezing hand and place that in front of what is now your pulling hand. Use your pulling hand to stretch the pasta towards your body, feeding it through the hand in front, which squeezes it as it passes through. Make sure to keep your pasta ropes well floured.\n\nThe strands will increase in length and once they are long enough, you can loop them over your hand again a few times and repeat the process. Stop when the ribbons resemble tagliatelle. (In Abruzzo, by the way, this process results in a pasta called maccheroni alla mugnaia, which stays as one long loop.) Slice the ribbons into 10cm lengths. Leave them spread out on the board or tray to dry a little. To make the chickpea and tomato sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and saut\u00e9 the onion until it is soft; this will take a good 5 minutes. Add the chickpeas, passata, salt and basil leaves and give everything a good stir. Leave the sauce to simmer for 10 minutes, until it has thickened slightly. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, add some salt and return to the boil. Throw the pasta ribbons in and cook for a few minutes \u2013 check one to make sure it\u2019s cooked. Drain and add the pasta to the chickpeas. Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over everything before serving.\n\nAlba\u2019s tagliatelle with rag\u00f9\n\nFor 4 people\n\nI expect you have your own recipe for spaghetti bolognese. Good old \u201cspag bol\u201d is a popular dish everywhere but Italy \u2013 where it\u2019s unheard of, because everyone knows meat rag\u00f9 is served with tagliatelle. So, when Vincenzo Vernocchi, a talented winemaker, got in touch saying his nonna makes amazing tagliatelle al rag\u00f9, we jumped at the chance to visit her. Alba greeted us wearing a deep blue, subtly brocaded dress and Versace trainers, drop earrings and a turquoise necklace. She has always been interested in fashion; her first job was working in a tailor\u2019s shop, like so many young women of her age. And, at 86 years old, she is a fab example of comfy chic. Alba\u2019s career in fashion didn\u2019t come to pass as she got married at 16 and, to begin with, worked with her husband on his farm. They ran an agriturismo, serving food, which became so successful that they left farming behind to concentrate on the restaurant, just outside Cesena, a town close to the Adriatic coast.\n\nWhile making this dish, Alba shares several suggestions: first, like most cooks in the area, she uses milk in the rag\u00f9, as it adds a touch of creaminess and sweetness and also balances out the acidity of the tomatoes. Next, she recommends using a tin of whole tomatoes and blitzing them to make a passata \u2013 the producers have to use their undamaged, unblemished tomatoes for this, making it a better-quality product. As for your pasta, if it\u2019s a little bit soft, then sprinkle grated parmigiano over the sfoglia to stop it from sticking when you roll it up. Alba doesn\u2019t like too much surface flour on her pasta.\n\nThere is, in fact, an official recipe for tagliatelle alla bolognese that was registered with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce in 1972. This instructs cooks to add a half glass of red wine; Alba doesn\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly an option, so have included it in this recipe. Ingredients can vary slightly, but long slow cooking is the key to a good rag\u00f9.\n\nFor the pasta\n\n400g 00 flour or plain flour\n\n4 eggs\n\nFor the rag\u00f9\n\n150g unsmoked pancetta, minced\n\n1 carrot, finely diced\n\n1 celery stick, finely diced\n\n1 onion, finely diced\n\n200g ground beef steak\n\n200g pork mince\n\nA glass of red wine (optional)\n\n400g good-quality tin whole tomatoes (eg san marzano or cherry)\n\n1tbsp tomato puree\u200b\n\n150ml whole milk\n\n1 bay leaf\n\nFreshly grated nutmeg (to taste)\n\nSalt\n\nTo serve\n\nGrated parmigiano reggiano\n\nMake the egg pasta dough as described. Once you have made your sfoglia, leave it for 5 minutes to dry a little, before rolling it up like a carpet and cutting across the pasta to create folded over ribbons about 7mm wide. If you want to make nests, for easier handling, then take 4 rolled ribbons at a time, shake them out, drape them over a finger and grab the 8 ends. Keep holding them and wrap the strands around your hand so you end up with a nest and the ends are on the inside. This way, the ends don\u2019t dry out as quickly.\n\nTake a casserole or deep saut\u00e9 pan and heat it over a medium flame. Add the pancetta and fry it so the fat is released. Saut\u00e9 the carrot, celery and onion, until the mixture is soft \u2013 it will take around 10 minutes. Then add the rest of the meat. Brown it, stirring frequently until the meat has broken up and looks like it\u2019s abandoned all hope of becoming a burger. If you want to add wine, do so now and let it evaporate. Blitz the tomatoes with a hand-held blender and pour this into the meat mixture. Stir in the tomato puree, half the milk, the bay leaf and plenty of freshly grated nutmeg. Let the mixture simmer very gently, adding more milk when necessary, for a couple of hours. At the end, when you push a spoon through the rag\u00f9 you should briefly see the bottom of the pan.\n\nBring a large pan of water to the boil, add a generous couple of teaspoons of salt and return the water to the boil before heaping in your pasta. Give it a stir and test your pasta for doneness after 1 minute. It should have cooked within 2 minutes.\n\nDrain it, return it in the pan and stir through the rag\u00f9. You want the rag\u00f9 to coat the pasta; resist the urge to drown your tagliatelle in the sauce. Plate up and add a final flurry of parmigiano reggiano over each serving.\n\nGaia\u2019s culurgiones with tomato sauce\n\nMakes 50 culurgiones, enough for 10 people\n\nOur brief for finding women (and men) for the Pasta Grannies YouTube channel is they have to be over 65. But we make exceptions, and Gaia is one of them because she is such a whizz at making culurgiones. Only, in her village of Escalaplano, in southeast Sardinia, they are called culixionis a spighetta. \u201cSpighetta\u201d refers to the way the ravioli is closed, making it look like an ear of corn. The spelling, size and fillings vary from village to village, but culurgiones always include mashed potato. They are made on special occasions, like the end of harvest and the Day of the Dead (1 November), and they are given to others as a symbol of friendship. \u201cI started to make pasta when I was really young, like five years old,\u201d Gaia tells us, \u201cwith my grandmothers, nonna Massimina and nonna Maria, who are both from Escalaplano. They encouraged me to play with the pasta, like it was a game, and I thought it was really good fun, especially since I got to play with them, too. When I was 19, I became really interested in learning my grandmothers\u2019 pasta secrets, so I asked nonna Massimina to teach me. She always said, \u2018Close the culurgiones with a very fine and dense seam, almost as though you are sewing by hand, with a lot of patience and commitment.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd she was thrilled when she saw the Pasta Grannies video with me \u2013 she loved that her teaching was reaching the wider world. Unfortunately, she passed away in September 2018, and that\u2019s why I want to dedicate this page in her memory. Thank you, nonna Massimina, for all your love and inspiration.\u201d\n\nThis recipe makes about 50 culurgiones \u2013 enough for 10 people if they are not going to have a second course. They freeze well though \u2013 cook them straight from frozen \u2013 and you can also halve the quantities if you wish.\n\nFor the pasta\n\n1kg finely ground semolina flour\n\n450-500ml water\n\n1tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n\n2tsp salt\n\nFor the tomato sauce\n\n1 onion, diced\n\n3-4tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n\n1kg passata\n\n20g fresh basil leaves, plus extra to serve\n\n\u00bdtsp salt\n\nFor the filling\n\n1kg potatoes\n\n100g aged pecorino, finely grated\n\n200g fresh pecorino, finely grated\n\n200g fresh soft goat\u2019s cheese\n\n4tbsp freshly chopped mint\n\n1 egg, beaten\n\n2 garlic cloves, minced to a pulp with a pinch of salt\n\n4tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n\nPinch of powdered saffron (optional)\n\nMake the durum wheat pasta dough as described. Not everyone puts oil into the dough, but for nonna Massimina it was very important. Set it aside to rest. Make the tomato sauce by softening the onion in olive oil in a saucepan, then adding the passata, whole basil leaves and salt. Leave the mixture to simmer for 30 minutes and remove the basil at the end of cooking. While the sauce is cooking, roll out the dough to about 2mm thick. Use a cookie cutter to make circles in the dough, 8cm in diameter. Keep them covered with just-damp tea towels to stop them from drying out.\n\nTo make the filling, peel, quarter and boil the potatoes. When cooked, after 15 minutes or so, drain them thoroughly, then mash them. Once the potatoes have cooled to lukewarm, thoroughly mix all the filling ingredients together.\n\nAdd a walnut-sized dollop into the centre of each pasta circle. Cup one in your left hand (if you are right-handed) and \u201csew\u201d the seam across the top, starting at one end of the half-moon with the tips of your thumb and forefinger of your other hand. It is an alternate pleating motion, bringing one side over the other (watching Gaia do it on the video is very helpful to understand what\u2019s happening).\n\nRemember, it will taste the same even if you get it wrong the first few times you try. Don\u2019t worry if some filling creeps out towards the end of the process either \u2013 it means you have created plump culurgiones.\n\nBring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the culurgiones in batches. Once they bob to the top \u2013 which will take around 5 minutes \u2013 you can scoop them out and dress them in the tomato sauce and basil leaves.\n\n\u2018Pasta Grannies: The Secrets of Italy\u2019s Best Home Cooks\u2019 by Vicky Bennison (Hardie Grant, \u00a320) Photography Emma Lee", "description": "How to make egg pasta dough The nonna way is to decide on how many eggs you are going to use, and use one handful of flour for every egg.
