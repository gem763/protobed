Jack 2. Harry 3. Charlie 4. Oliver 5. George\n\nNaughtiest girls 1. Mia 2. Ella 3. Isabella 4. Amelia 5. Sophia\n\nOf the 20 most popular baby names in 2019, 23 per cent agreed that Jacks are the worst behaved children, coming under heavy criticism from teachers who expect them to be unkind to their classmates.\n\nThe strong correlation between gender and naughtiness is laid bare in the research, with the top seven names all boys.\n\nMischievous Mia is the most badly behaved girl's name, ranking in eighth in the joint-list.\n\nBut the children who were questioned claimed that Emily, not Mia, is the most naughty girl's name.\n\nAnd in a further blow to the children on the naughty list, the findings revealed they were also assumed to be the least clever.\n\nBest behaved boys 1. Arthur 2. Noah 3. Oscar 4. Muhammad 5. Leo\n\nBest behaved girls 1. Isla 2. Ava 3. Grace 4. Olivia 5. Emily\n\nIn fact, as many as 96 per cent of teachers, children and parents do not associate the name Mia with being brainy.\n\nOnly four per cent of the respondents attached the name Arthur was mischief, making it the most angelic name on the list.\n\nYet it was also associated with shy boys, as was the name Noah.\n\nGeorges and Isabellas are thought to be the cleverest, but, along with Harry Isabella is also tarnished with being the most spoilt.\n\nA baby name generator produced by My Nametags, which commissioned the research, suggests names for your children based on your personality traits.\n\nChildren's names stereotypes Most confident: Charlie and Olivia Most shy: Grace, Arthur and Noah Most clever: George and Isabella Least clever: Jack and Mia Most spoilt: Harry and Isabella\n\nChartered Clinical Psychologist and Scientist, Linda Blair said: 'Rather than making judgments about others scientifically - taking a dispassionate look at everyone called Noah or Isabella, for example - we create our stereotypes using just the people we know, as well as those we think we know via social and other media.\n\n'Once we've formed a stereotype, it becomes fixed in our minds because of a phenomenon known as \"confirmatory bias\".\n\n'This is when we look for and remember people who match up to the stereotype we've formed, while at the same time ignoring information that doesn't fit.\n\n'This is why we become so convinced our stereotypes are correct. For popular names, these stereotypes are likely to be at the forefront of our minds because most of us will already know or have read about someone called Jack, Harry or Emily\u2014and we're quite likely to meet more of them.'", "description": "A survey of 1,500 UK teachers, parents and fellow infants revealed the stereotypes they automatically attach to boys and girls based on their name.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/13/20035262-0-image-a-7_1571748887395.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
