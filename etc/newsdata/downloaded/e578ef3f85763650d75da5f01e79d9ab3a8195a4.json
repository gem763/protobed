He is not. No one is above the law, even a British Prime Minister.\"\n\nThe court papers emerged on Friday as part of a legal challenge by businessman Vince Dale, SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC.\n\nTheir QC Aidan O'Neill told the court that submissions from the government revealed the prime minister \"will send a letter... no later than 19 October\" to the EU, asking for delay.\n\nYet key Cabinet allies today again refused to confirm the Prime Minister will send the letter to delay.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay refused to guarantee the letter will be sent, instead telling the BBC: \"I can absolutely confirm the government will abide by the law.\"\n\nAnd quizzed by Sky News, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick also repeatedly refused to confirm the letter will be sent.\n\nHe said: \"We've said that as any Government would do we will comply with the law... however all of our efforts now are focused on trying to get a deal.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"And we've just put forward some, I think, very reasonable and thoughtful proposals to the EU - they try to answer the questions that had dogged the previous deal prepared by Theresa May .\"\n\nPressed again, Mr Jenrick said: \"The Prime Minister has been very clear that he is not going to extend Article 50 - I don't think he personally could have been any clearer.\n\n\"We have said that we will comply with the law however what we're going to do now is work as hard as we possibly can to secure that deal.\"\n\n(Image: Hollie Adams)\n\nMr Jenrick insisted the Government has \"no intention\" of extending Article 50 to delay Britain's departure from the EU if a deal cannot be agreed.\n\n\"We think the UK needs to move forward,\" he said.\n\nThe Cabinet minister went on to say: \"Boris Johnson and this Government will do absolutely everything in our power to deliver Brexit on October 31.\n\n\"But we have no plan as to what might happen if Parliament doesn't allow us to get Brexit done on October 31 because we intend to get it done on that date and that's the sole focus of this Government at the moment.\"\n\nToday Boris Johnson insisted Britain will pack its bags and walk out at the end of the month, but admitted Europe may not \"cheerily wave us off\" with a deal.\n\nHe unveiled a new Brexit plan involving \"two borders\" in Northern Ireland last week.\n\nBut the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier poured scorn on the chances of the new proposal succeeding.\n\nMr Barnier told an event in Paris: \"If they do not change, I do not believe, on the basis of the mandate I have been given by the EU27, that we can advance.\"\n\nIrish premier Leo Varadkar said Boris Johnson could secure a Brexit deal in the next two weeks - but the current proposals do not form the basis for \"deeper negotiations\".\n\nLeo Varadkar said next Friday would be a reasonable cut-off point to get a deal done ahead of an October 17 EU summit.\n\nMeanwhile the UK is seeking advice from Australia on developing a points-based immigration system post-Brexit, Priti Patel said.\n\nThe Home Secretary discussed the scheme with her Australian counterpart Peter Dutton when in the United States last week.", "description": "Geoffrey Cox reportedly had a 'heated' exchange with the PM as court papers claim Boris Johnson will ask to delay Brexit - yet the \"forked tongue\" PM and his allies refuse to say they'll comply", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Pa Wire Pa Images", "Leon Neal", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Hollie Adams"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20507295.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
