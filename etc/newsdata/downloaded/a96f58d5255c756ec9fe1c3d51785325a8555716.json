The protection, established by Congress in 1990, is designed to avoid returning immigrants to home countries plagued by war, recovering from natural disasters or dealing with an epidemic.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which administers the protection, had previously announced the eventual termination of TPS protections for more than 250,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Honduras, Sudan and Haiti, but litigation has prevented the administration from dismantling the programs. But for the court rulings, the termination of the TPS designation for El Salvador would've occurred last month.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S., in addition to extending their work authorization, also pledged to give TPS beneficiaries from El Salvador a year to return to their home country after the \"conclusion\" of litigation surrounding the administration's controversial decisions to terminate TPS program.\n\nIn this May 25, 2018 photo, Nilson Canenguez, left, who is on the Temporary Protected Status program, or TPS, hugs his daughter Maybelin as his wife Judit looks on at their home in Morningside, Maryland.

They are not alone.\"\n\nHill, who was in Washington on Monday to sign the agreements, said her government would continue to look for a \"permanent solution\" to the uncertain status of tens of thousands of its citizens in the U.S. Protections for them have been a priority for the Bukele government, which has vowed to foster more economic opportunity to discourage migration to the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump meets with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador during the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, September 25, 2019, in New York.

The asylum accord is one of three agreements outgoing Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan forged with all three countries in Central America's Northern Triangle, which includes Guatemala and Honduras.\n\n\"Today's agreements will significantly help the U.S. and our partners in El Salvador confront illegal migration and will strengthen the entire region as we approach the implementation of asylum cooperative agreements,\" McAleenan said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to the deal on TPS, the two countries signed two other agreements on Monday. Both sides agreed to the deployment of U.S. immigration authorities to El Salvador to assist officials there curb drug and human trafficking, as well as to sharing biometric data to combat crime.\n\nIn a press release, the Department of Homeland Security said it was still committed to ensuring that TPS beneficiaries return to El Salvador through an \"orderly and responsible process.\" But the department suggested that an abrupt end to their protections might backfire.\n\n\"A sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border,\" the release said.", "description": "Under the agreement, more than 200,000 Salvadorans will have more time to live and work in the U.S. after their Temporary Protected Status (TPS) expires in 2021", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez", "Camilo Montoya-Galvez Is The Immigration Reporter At Cbs News.
