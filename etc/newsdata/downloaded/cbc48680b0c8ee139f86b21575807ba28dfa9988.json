Arlington is the United Auto Workers union's largest local, representing more than 5,000 people.\n\nThe voting percentages were posted Friday on the local's website but no totals were given. Also, workers at an assembly plant in Wentzville, Mo., near St. Louis approved the deal Friday, with 63.5 per cent of production workers and 69.9 per cent of skilled trades in favour.\n\nAbout 49,000 GM workers walked off their jobs Sept. 16, halting production at more than 30 U.S. factories and hampering it in Mexico and Canada due to parts shortages. Analysts estimate the strike cost GM more than $2 billion US.\n\nLeaders at the union local office in Arlington apparently think the contract will be approved when national vote totals are announced later Friday.\n\nThe website told members to check after 4 p.m. Friday to find out when they return to work.\n\nThe new four-year contract includes a mix of wage increases and annual lump-sum payments, as well as an $11,000 signing bonus. But it also allows GM to close three U.S. factories that made slow-selling cars and transmissions.", "description": "Workers at the General Motors factory with the most UAW employees have approved a new contract, all but assuring the deal will be ratified and a contentious 40-day strike will end soon.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5335392.1572019309!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/gm-strike-agreement.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
