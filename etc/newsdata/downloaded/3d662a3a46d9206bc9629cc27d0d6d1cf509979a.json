General Assembly meeting in New York.\n\nIn his comments, Zarif sought to expose current strains between the Americans and the Saudis under Trump, who long has criticized U.S. wars in the Middle East.\n\nTrump\u2019s close relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been challenged by opponents following the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi last year in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and the kingdom\u2019s long, bloody war in Yemen. That country\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed the oil field attack Saturday in Saudi Arabia, although the U.S. alleges Iran carried it out.\n\n\u201cI think it is important for the Saudi government to understand what they\u2019re what they\u2019re trying to achieve. Do they want to fight Iran until the last American soldier? Is that their aim?\u201d Zarif asked in a CNN interview. \u201cThey can be assured that this won\u2019t be the case \u2026 because Iran will defend itself.\u201d\n\nAsked by the broadcaster what would be the consequence of a U.S. or Saudi strike, Zarif bluntly said: \u201cAn all-out war.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making a very serious statement that we don\u2019t want war. We don\u2019t want to engage in a military confrontation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that a military confrontation based on deception is awful.\u201d\n\nZarif, who was to travel to New York on Friday, added: \u201cWe\u2019ll have a lot of casualties, but we won\u2019t blink to defend our territory.\u201d\n\nPompeo, who was in the United Arab Emirates, dismissed Zarif\u2019s remarks, saying: \u201cI was here (doing) active diplomacy while the foreign minister of Iran is threatening all-out war to fight to the last American.\u201d\n\nPompeo said he hoped Iran would choose a path toward peace, but he remained doubtful. He described \u201can enormous consensus in the region\u201d that Iran carried out the attack.\n\n\u201cThere are still those today who think, \u2018Boy, if we just give Iran just a little bit more money they\u2019ll become a peaceful nation,'\u201d he said. \u201cWe can see that that does not work.\u201d\n\nPompeo met Abu Dhabi\u2019s powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The UAE is a close ally of Saudi Arabia and joined the kingdom in its war with the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The 4-year-old war has killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed much of the country, with millions more driven from their homes and thrown into near starvation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pompeo met with the Saudi crown prince in Jiddah about the attack on the kingdom\u2019s crucial oil processing facility and oil field, which cut its oil production in half.\n\nWhile Pompeo struck a hard line, Trump has been noncommittal on whether he would order U.S. military retaliation. He said separately Wednesday that he is moving to increase financial sanctions on Tehran over the attack, without elaborating. Iran already is subject to a crushing American sanctions program targeting its crucial oil industry.\n\nThe UAE said it had joined a U.S.-led coalition to protect waterways across the Middle East after the attack in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe state-run WAM news agency quoted Salem al-Zaabi of the Emirati Foreign Ministry as saying the UAE joined the coalition to \u201censure global energy security and the continued flow of energy supplies to the global economy.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia joined the coalition on Wednesday. Australia, Bahrain and the United Kingdom also are taking part.\n\nThe U.S. formed the coalition after attacks on oil tankers that Washington blamed on Tehran, as well as Iran\u2019s seizure of tankers in the region. Iran denies being behind the tanker explosions, although the attacks came after Tehran threatened to stop oil exports from the Persian Gulf.\n\nIraq said it would not join the coalition. The government in Baghdad, which is allied with both Iran and the U.S., has tried to keep a neutral stance amid the tensions.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, the Saudis displayed broken and burned drones and pieces of a cruise missile that military spokesman Col. Turki Al-Malki identified as Iranian weapons collected after the attack. He also played surveillance video that he said showed a drone coming in from the north. Yemen is to the south of Saudi Arabia.\n\nEighteen drones and seven cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Al-Malki said, with three missiles failing to hit their targets. He said the cruise missiles had a range of 700 kilometers (435 miles), meaning they could not have been fired from inside Yemen. That opinion was shared by weapons experts who spoke to The Associated Press .\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian similarly was skeptical of the Houthi claim of responsibility.\n\n\u201cThis is not very credible, relatively speaking,\u201d he told CNews television. \u201cBut we sent our experts to have our own vision of things.\u201d\n\nSeparately, a U.N. panel of experts on Yemen arrived in Saudi Arabia to investigate the attack, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Any attack on Iran by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia will spark an \"all-out war,\" Tehran's top diplomat warned", "authors": ["Jon Gambrell"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/iran_foreign_minister_mohammad_javad_zarif.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
