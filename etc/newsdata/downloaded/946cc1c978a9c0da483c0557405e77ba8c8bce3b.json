T -1.27% isn\u2019t sure it wants to renew the deal.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief operating officer, John Stankey, said he believes Sunday Ticket\u2019s value to the company has peaked and that a renewal\u2014especially if it comes with a higher price tag\u2014will be hard to justify at a time when consumers are canceling pay-TV connections, including at DirecTV.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s less profitability to support the decision\u201d to offer Sunday Ticket, Mr. Stankey said in an interview earlier this week. \u201cIt becomes less critical to the business over time.\u201d\n\nJohn Stankey, AT&T\u2019s chief operating officer Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nAny change may take some time. The current deal runs through the 2022 regular season and DirecTV pays an average annual rights fee of $1.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Still, it isn\u2019t unusual for sports rights negotiations to begin well before contracts expire.\n\nDirecTV would be open to discuss sharing the package with other platforms. Typically, nonexclusive packages are far less costly. \u201cWe\u2019d always look at it,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cIt all gets down to what the price of something is.\u201d\n\nAn NFL spokesman declined to comment. The league recently had an opportunity to exit from the DirecTV arrangement, but opted to maintain the current deal, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe NFL carves up its rights across multiple TV networks and digital platforms. In addition to DirecTV, a number of TV networks including CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN each have a portion of the league\u2019s schedule. Amazon.com Inc. streams Thursday night games, while Verizon Communications Inc. streams all in-market games and national games on mobile devices.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Is access to NFL games keeping you from cutting the cord with your TV provider? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe Sunday Ticket package has been exclusive to DirecTV since 1994 and has allowed the satellite broadcaster to distinguish itself from rival pay-TV operators. Sunday Ticket customers can view all \u201cout of market\u201d games, meaning those televised outside their home market.\n\nThere are two Sunday Ticket offerings, one for $300 per season and another with more bells and whistles that costs $400. There is also an online offering for people who can verify that they can\u2019t receive satellite signals.\n\nThe cost of Sunday Ticket rights has risen dramatically. The current 8-year deal\u2019s average annual fee is a roughly 50% increase over the previous pact, which expired in 2014. DirecTV loses more than $500 million annually on the football package, people with knowledge of the deal said.\n\nMr. Stankey thinks the audience doesn\u2019t have much room to expand. \u201cI don\u2019t think we look at that and say it\u2019s a growth product,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to wake up a year from now and suddenly there\u2019s going to be more people in the United States that want to watch an out-of-market team.\u201d\n\nDirecTV doesn\u2019t disclose how many of its customers subscribe to Sunday Ticket, but people with familiar with the matter say there are around two million paying subscribers.\n\nIn a pay-TV industry where all distributors are struggling as consumers increasingly cut the cord in favor of streaming-video options, DirecTV has been going through particularly tough times. The satellite broadcaster has lost millions of subscribers over the past several years. In addition, programming costs continue to rise.\n\nMoffettNathanson Research analyst Craig Moffett said while subscription fees for Sunday Ticket alone don\u2019t cover the cost of the NFL contract, there are other factors in evaluating its value to DirecTV.\n\nDirecTV still earns healthy profit margins from Sunday Ticket subscribers as a whole, and many people only choose the satellite broadcaster because of the Sunday Ticket package.\n\n\u201cLose the \u2018Ticket\u2019 and those customers will walk,\u201d Mr. Moffett said.\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "description": "The NFL\u2019s Sunday Ticket package has long been a cornerstone of DirecTV.
