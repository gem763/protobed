If the court finds against the plaintiffs\u2014as is likely, given the court\u2019s conservative majority\u2014it will be widely understood as legalizing \u201cfiring someone because they are gay or trans.\u201d (In fact, gay and trans people can already be fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity in 28 states, and this case would not affect the 22 other ones.) That will have societal impact far greater than any actual legal holding.\n\nIn November, the court will hear three challenges to the Trump administration\u2019s suspension of DACA, the \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d policy that postpones enforcement actions against so-called \u201cDreamers,\u201d undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.\n\nUnlike the LGBTQ cases, the DACA challenges will immediately impact thousands of undocumented people who voluntarily turned their information over to the government in exchange for protection, and are now having that information used against them by a nationalist regime eager to deport them. The Supreme Court\u2019s review, however, will largely focus on whether the DACA program, which was an Obama-era agency prioritization decision rather than a formal rule, is even subject to judicial review.\n\nPerhaps the most contentious case of the term will be heard in December, when the court takes up its first major Second Amendment case in 11 years. At issue is a New York City law that bans transporting a handgun to a shooting range outside the city. The larger issue is that the case will be the first time the newly conservative court (with Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on board) will address the extent of the private right to bear arms that the court discovered (or invented) in the 2008 case of D.C. v. Heller.\n\nAt the eleventh hour\u2014perhaps anticipating that the court will expand its interpretation of the Second Amendment\u2014the city and state of New York have effectively repealed this law, potentially rendering the case moot. As of now, however, the case is still on track, meaning that Trump\u2019s \u201cNRA people\u201d could be in for some very good news in the new year.\n\nLastly, just last week, the court agreed to hear a challenge to Louisiana\u2019s new requirements for the state\u2019s abortion clinics, which would cause many of them to close. The case is a near-copy of a 2016 case, but there is one crucial difference: Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh\u2019s predecessor, Justice Anthony Kennedy, was the swing vote in 2016, and Justice Kavanaugh has sharply condemned Roe in public statements. This probably means that the 2016 case will be overturned and a series of so-called TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Provider) laws will be quickly passed across the country.\n\nMore broadly, that case will likely be the first of several abortion-related cases to be heard this term, with new laws having practically banned abortion in Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, Mississippi, and Georgia.\n\nThe new crop of laws are in clear violation of existing Supreme Court cases, which is precisely the point: they are meant to afford the new court an opportunity to revisit Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which allowed restrictions on abortions only if they do not place an \u201cundue burden\u201d on women seeking them, and Roe v. Wade itself.\n\nBecause they violate existing precedent, the new laws have all been placed on hold for now (including, in Missouri\u2019s case, with Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 agreement), but those delays are only temporary. Given Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s place on the court, it seems certain that the right to control one\u2019s own uterus will be sharply curtailed in the next year; the only questions are when and by how much.\n\nIn addition to the cases already scheduled for review, several high-profile cases are wending their way up to the Supreme Court, and are likely to be accepted for review. These include a cluster of challenges to Trump\u2019s border wall, and the highly dubious declaration of emergency that grabbed funds to pay for it even though Congress refused to do so. It\u2019s likely that one or more of these challenges will reach the court within the next six months.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s quite possible that issues related to the Trump impeachment inquiry will reach the Supreme Court on an expedited basis. Already, Trump administration officials have raised questions about whether some of the documents at the center of that inquiry are subject to executive privilege, and new disclosures have revealed that the administration is shielding still more documents from public view.\n\nThere are even legal processes still ongoing regarding the last few administration scandals\u2014the numerous lies told under oath by administration officials regarding the U.S. Census, the Mueller investigation, and even Hurricane Dorian.
