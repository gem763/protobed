Whatever happens we\u2019ll remain on @BBCOne .\"\n\nLineker has been vocal regarding his stance on Brexit , demanding a People's Vote on leaving the European Union.\n\nHe has previously been criticised for his political comments on social media, given his position within the impartial BBC.\n\nSpeaking about his stance last month, Lineker said: \u201cI believe I\u2019m on the right side. I think the country\u2019s been lied to.\n\n\u201cWhen the referendum first came about, I thought \u2018well that\u2019s it, okay, it\u2019s not what I really wanted, it\u2019s a shame\u2019.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was very good for the country because I\u2019d done quite a lot of research before I had my opinions. I thought I needed to know what I was talking about, and I concluded that it\u2019d be hugely damaging to the country.\n\n\u201cObviously I was massively disappointed and then I thought \u2018alright, I\u2019ll accept it, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s fine\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut then gradually you started to realise all the lies that came out that were told before the referendum.\n\n\u201cSo, in the end, I came out on the side of \u2018hang on a minute, now we know what it\u2019s really about, let\u2019s perhaps put it back to the people\u2019.\u201d", "description": "The BBC could be forced to move the start time of Match of the Day back amid events in Westminster this evening", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Bbc Pete Dadds", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20381225.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_16371358-high-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
