Notably, in March 2018, a machine developed by engineers at MIT managed to solve a cube in just 0.38 seconds.\n\nWhat\u2019s significant with OpenAI\u2019s effort is the use of a multi-purpose robot, in this case a human-hand-like design, rather than a machine specifically designed to handle a Rubik\u2019s cube and nothing else.\n\n\u201cThe ability to solve the Rubik\u2019s cube in the real world, on a robot hand, is actually extremely difficult,\u201d said Matthias Plappert, team leader for robotics at OpenAI, speaking to the BBC.\n\n\u201cYou need to very precisely control your fingers, you need to do it for a very long time without kind of messing up in between. and a lot of different things can happen in the process.\u201d\n\nSkip Youtube post by OpenAI Warning: Third party content may contain adverts Report End of Youtube post by OpenAI\n\nMr Plappert hailed the team\u2019s method of gradually injecting complications into the process - simulated hindrances that would force the robot to adapt in order to complete the cube.\n\nThis technique - called automatic domain randomisation (ADR) - was used, the team said, to give the robot consistent, intricate dexterity that can handle changes in the environment that go beyond what a computer could predict and simulate.\n\n'Showmanship'\n\nIn a demonstration video posted on Tuesday, OpenAI demonstrated how adding difficulty for the robot - such as nudging the cube with a giraffe stuffed toy, or covering the cube with a black sheet - did not necessarily prevent the completion of the cube (though the hand did not have a 100% record, researchers said).\n\nWhile instinctive to humans, handling disruptions or complications, particularly when dealing with holding and manipulating objects, is seen as a grand challenge of robotics - a problem that will need to be solved if advanced robotics are to become commonplace in every home and business.\n\n\u201cWe use human hands for all kinds of things,\u201d said Peter Welinder, also a team leader at OpenAI.\n\n\u201cWe use them to solve Rubik\u2019s cubes, but we also use them for cooking meals. This is one of the reasons we picked the robotic hand, because it promises much more general purpose robots.\n\nImage copyright OpenAI Image caption The team interjected with mild disturbances to the robot to see if it was able to handle unexpected incidents\n\n\u201cThe big obstacle has been manipulation. So we took the Rubik's Cube as an example of really how far can we push manipulation.\u201d\n\nBut, argues Prof Ken Goldberg from UC Berkeley, OpenAI\u2019s research should not be overstated, despite being what he described as an impressive act of \u201cshowmanship\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe average human isn't particularly good at solving Rubik\u2019s cubes,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\n\u201cSo when they see a robot doing it, they say, \u2018well, this is better than a human\u2019. But that's a little deceptive - because games are not reality.\u201d\n\nHe said OpenAI\u2019s ADR technique was genuine progress, but handling items more complex and unpredictable than a Rubik\u2019s cube will require more research.\n\n\u201cWill we get to the point where a robot could pick up a deck of cards and shuffle them like a Las Vegas croupier? Or anyone who's reasonably good at doing that? That could be 10-20 years off.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re far from being able to replace kitchen workers who chop up vegetables, or even pick up and you know, do dishwashing. All those are very complex tasks.\u201d\n\nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify the performance of OpenAI\u2019s robot. And, while details were not disputed by the experts the BBC spoke to, OpenAI\u2019s research paper was not peer-reviewed.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
