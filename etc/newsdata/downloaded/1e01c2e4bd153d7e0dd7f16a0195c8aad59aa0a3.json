Components of the house were manufactured by Scholz, shipped to the site and then assembled by local builders. (HomeVisit)\n\nThe land surrounding this midcentury modern house in Gaithersburg, Md., is no Hundred Acre Wood, but owner Charles Tilford says it\u2019s \u201c10 times better than Winnie.\u201d\n\nThe low-slung house is also no Owl\u2019s House, but they share at least a few similarities. They both are in the woods and are perfect for inviting friends to tea.\n\nAlthough nestled in Great Seneca Stream Valley Park along Great Seneca Creek, the house wasn\u2019t always surrounded by parkland. In 1968 \u2014 two years after the house was built \u2014 the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission began acquiring the land around it in stages and turning the area into a public park while the 5.3-acre lot remained private property.\n\n1 of 114 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Distinguished homes for sale in the D.C. region View Photos The Washington Post\u2019s picks of distinguished local homes on the market.

Prettyman, who came from a well-known legal family in Montgomery County. The U.S. District Court building in the District is named after his cousin E. Barrett Prettyman. Charles Prettyman practiced law in the office of his father and grandfather before serving as counsel for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and the county Board of Education.\n\nDavid E. Betts said at a Bar Association of Montgomery County memorial that Prettyman \u201cloved to get out with his dogs, and I suppose you could say, poetically, \u2018commune with Nature.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe house is ideal for a nature lover like Prettyman, who unfortunately died two years after it was built.\n\n\n\nOutdoor spaces include a balcony that spans the length of the house and a deck with a water feature and room for dining and relaxing. (HomeVisit)\n\nCharles and his wife, Carol, who bought the house in 1978, are just the third owners. They say it is a Scholz Mark 58 house. Donald Scholz founded Scholz Homes in Toledo, Ohio, in 1946 to take advantage of the postwar housing boom. Scholz wasn\u2019t a trained architect, but he was influenced by Mies van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd Wright. His home designs featured strong horizontal lines, open floor plans, cathedral ceilings and lots of windows. He used innovative prefabrication techniques to keep the cost of his house low. The components of the house were manufactured by Scholz, shipped to the homeowner and then assembled by local builders.\n\nScholz sold more than 50,000 California contemporary houses like this one across the country, including another in Montgomery County. He was named one of the 20th century\u2019s most influential figures in the residential building industry by Builder Magazine in 2000.\n\n\n\nNestled in Great Seneca Stream Valley Park along Great Seneca Creek, the house is surrounded by parkland. (HomeVisit)\n\nAccording to the Tilfords, Prettyman significantly modified the house\u2019s design when constructing it. Since then, they also have made substantial alterations to the home. However, many original features such as the glulam beams remain.\n\nGlulam \u2014 or glued laminated timber \u2014 is made of layers of lumber bonded together to form a beam. These beams stretch across the main living area. The Tilfords also added them to the master bedroom when they expanded the house.\n\nWith the help of Silver Spring architect Shawn Buehler of Bennett Frank McCarthy Architects, the Tilfords extended the L-shape house in 2006 by adding a master bedroom and bathroom to one end. The original stone exterior became a feature wall in the bedroom and bathroom. Skylights, glass blocks and clerestory windows bring abundant natural light into the space. A gas fireplace warms the room.\n\nThe four-bedroom, five-bathroom, 2,839-square-foot house is listed at $750,000.", "description": "HOUSE OF THE WEEK | A public park grew up around this midcentury modern house, built for a Montgomery County lawyer.", "authors": ["Kathy Orton", "Reporter", "Editor Covering The Washington Metropolitan Area Housing Market", "September At Am", "Kathy Orton Is A Reporter", "Web Editor For The Real Estate Section.
