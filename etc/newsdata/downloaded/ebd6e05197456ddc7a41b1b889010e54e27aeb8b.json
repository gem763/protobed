Then Samsung gave the Fold to a bunch of savages (aka tech reviewers), who pawed at it like it was a normal phone, and then the Fold had to go away for some upgrades.\n\nThen on September 27th, the Fold finally, officially went on sale, and I\u2019ve been using it ever since\u2014without any cases, skins, or screen protectors. So here\u2019s what it\u2019s like to live with most important phone of the year after a month.\n\nDespite taking five months to tweak and retool the Fold before bringing it back, the final device doesn\u2019t feel that much different than the original model that had so many issues. Samsung added a steel plate behind the flexible screen to give the Fold increased rigidity. And on the software front, the biggest change is that the Android nav buttons have now been shifted to the right for better one-handed use, which doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it actually makes a significant difference. (Don\u2019t worry lefties, there\u2019s a setting for moving the nav buttons to the other side of the screen too.)\n\nClosing that gap between the Fold\u2019s flexible display was a much needed fix. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nBut most importantly, Samsung covered up the small holes between Fold\u2019s flexible display and its hinge to keep particles from getting inside the phone. And you know what, it worked, mostly. Because in my month with the Fold, not once have I encountered anything getting inside or under its display. And that\u2019s even with the tiny bits of dust or lint that you often find on top of its screen after its been sitting closed for a while.\n\nAs for the edges of the polymer film that used to be around the perimeter of the Fold\u2019s screen, they\u2019ve been extended so now those edges rest beneath the phone\u2019s bezels, away from any potential prying fingers. Now, was Samsung to blame for not doing a better job of informing reviewers not to peel back the film on the original Fold, or at least keep the film hidden better? Sure, but at the same time, at least part of the blame falls on reviewers too.\n\nHere\u2019s a shot of the Fold\u2019s screen with a black background, so as to not hide any blemishes. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nSo many people went in and treated the Fold like it was any other phone, despite mountains of evidence that it was not. It\u2019s as if someone traded in a horse for a car, through a saddle on it and then wondered why it looked so silly. In the end, having people expose one of the Fold\u2019s biggest flaws was an important lesson in human stupidity on both sides of the device.\n\nAll of this still doesn\u2019t make the Fold very tough though. You can put creases in its screen with your fingernails if you try, it\u2019s not water-resistant, and even with additional protection against particles, the Fold can\u2019t withstand a handful of sand.\n\nThat might sound pretty bad, but put another way, the Fold basically has the same durability as most laptops, with a slightly softer screen. You wouldn\u2019t bring a laptop to the beach, and even if you did, you\u2019d know better than to bury it in the sand. The Fold\u2019s fragility doesn\u2019t sound so scary now, does it? And if you do want to bring the Fold to the beach, just put it in a bag. Easy.\n\nAnd here\u2019s another one from an angle for good measure. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nThe other two things people are often concerned about\u2014the Fold\u2019s crease and its hinge\u2014are honestly non-issues. When you look at it straight on, the crease is practically invisible. And when it comes to the Fold\u2019s hinge, it\u2019s probably the single most durable component on the entire device.\n\nMeanwhile, if you can put up with the Fold\u2019s limitations, what you get is one of the most engaging, multipurpose devices on the planet. Just being able to watch videos on a big 7.3-inch screen while riding the train makes time pass that much faster. The Fold is also a great tool for the gym, as its screen is better than anything you\u2019ll find built into a treadmill or stationary bike not made by Peloton.\n\nThe Fold\u2019s cover screen simply needs to be bigger. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nThe Fold has also made my Kindle and my home tablet obsolete, as it\u2019s pretty much the perfect size for reading books or comics. And thanks to its ridiculously long battery life and massive 512GB of storage, it feels like the Fold never needs help from silly accessories like battery packs or external (or cloud) storage. Screw all those old overpriced Vertu phones, the Galaxy Fold is true techno luxury.\n\nThat said, the Fold still has plenty of room for improvement. Making it a tiny bit lighter would make it easier to hold over long periods of time. And while pocketing the Fold has never been an issue for me, some added thinness wouldn\u2019t hurt either. I would also love to see Samsung eliminate the notch on the inside of the phone, people can take selfies with the camera above the Cover Screen instead.\n\nAnd as for the Fold\u2019s 4.6-inch Cover Screen itself, just make the damn thing bigger. There\u2019s tons of room above and below, and even a little room on the sides. As it stands, even when you\u2019re using the Cover Screen \u201ccorrectly\u201d just to look up directions or reply quickly to a text, typing on that tiny keyboard is frustrating.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo\n\nNow I admit, for a lot of people, none of this matters until the Fold\u2019s price (or the price of its successors) comes down and phone makers equip it with flexible glass instead of plastic (which is something that\u2019s been rumoured for the Galaxy Fold 2). But in the meantime, you might want to keep an open mind. You might not want a Galaxy Fold now, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see foldable phones represent 20 to 25 per cent of new phone sales within the next five years.\n\nIs the Galaxy Fold perfect? No, far from it. But during the past month, it\u2019s displayed massive potential, so for me, folding is believing.", "description": "Following the ambitious but janky Royole Flexpai, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold was supposed to be the redeemer, a device that demonstrated the power of foldable tech.
