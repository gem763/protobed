Not as sport.\n\n\u2018I never looked at his hobbies in an objective way before. Hunting and eating animals are so normalised, I never questioned it.\n\n\u2018But when the veil of animal agriculture was exposed to me in a new way I went through a period of being mad at the world. I felt lied to. And my husband didn\u2019t make the connection right away which was also devastating.\n\n\u2018What saved my marriage was realising that people will not change if you tell them what they\u2019re doing is wrong. You have to lead by example and lead with compassion and understanding.\u2019\n\nAt their month their four-month-old son follows his mum\u2019s diet (Picture: MDWfeatures / Tandi Rolen)\n\nTheir son Brookes is currently following his mum\u2019s lifestyle and getting his nutrients from plants.\n\nTandi admits that the couple is sometimes questioned about their contrasting views on animal product consumption but says that their relationship is proof that both vegans and non-vegans can integrate.\n\n\u2018Everything is not a one size fits all\u2019 (Picture: MDWfeatures / Tandi Rolen)\n\n\u2018We eat whole plant foods plus my husband has deer or grouse, it\u2019s quite easy actually. We have dairy-free alternatives as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Everyone is so far on one side of the spectrum. But the truth is everything is not a one size fits all. Lifestyle and diet included.\n\n\u2018We have to integrate. And we must take the best options on both sides and practice them.\u2019\n\nMORE: Husband tells vegan wife she should eat meat as she\u2019s pregnant, \u2018for the baby\u2019s health\u2019\n\nMORE: Mum says midwife refused to help her because she\u2019s vegan\n\nMORE: 2020 wedding trends: Fairytale wedding dresses and vegan menus are set to be big next year\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Plant-based chef Tandi Rolen, 28, from Washington, met her husband, gunsmith and fishing guide, Mitchell Rolen, 28, when they were just 16.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mdw_1571668785.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
