Moments of bliss are rare these days considering I don\u2019t do drugs and I spend most of my time sneering, scoffing or despairing, so it was nice to feel my heart swell and my eyes fill up with tears of happiness, which, considering I have chronic dry-eye syndrome, is a feat in itself.\n\nSo let me tell you what these moments entailed: one involved standing in a field of dahlias, with St Michael\u2019s Mount silhouetted in the distance, oh God, I\u2019m feeling emotional just typing this, I\u2019m talking thousands of dahlias, all different sizes, colours and shapes, from tiny round-headed pom-pom flowers to massive shaggy-headed things. Forget the Chelsea flower show, The National Collection of Dahlias (near Penzance) is free to everyone and there is even a portaloo in the field for those of us who find ourselves overwhelmed with excitement.\n\nThe next thing that left me feeling stunned and grateful was sitting in the American artist James Turrell\u2019s extraordinary \u201cskyspace\u201d, perched high up in the Tremenheere sculpture gardens.\n\nTurrell is quite a guy. For over 50 years he\u2019s been playing with our perceptions of light and his skyspaces quite simply force you to sit in an enclosed space and look at what is essentially the ceiling of the world.\n\nMaybe this is what being in church feels like for some people? For me and the old man, on a glorious September day sitting silently in a small oval-shaped dome chamber and looking at a perfect ellipse of Dulux \u201cwing commander\u201d blue sky, occasionally criss-crossed with vapour trails and fast scudding clouds, it was as if every moment of luck and happiness had been bottled in one image.\n\nTurrell has created more than 80 sky chambers around the world and since 1977, he has been working on the ultimate skyspace chamber in an extinct volcano in Arizona, which is as yet not open to the public, however there are four available to view in this country and like Pokemon cards, I would like to collect them all.\n\nOf course, no moment is truly perfect and as we arrived \u201chome\u201d at the bungalow I realised I\u2019d dropped my denim jacket somewhere in the sculpture gardens, the good jacket that hides my bum. Normally I\u2019d have been devastated, but \u2013 and this is how profoundly Turrell\u2019s work had affected me \u2013 I managed to weigh it up.\n\nYes, on the one hand I\u2019d lost my jacket, but on the other hand I\u2019d had this fantastic experience that, dare I say it, was better than the jacket. Now bear in mind, this was a really good jacket, it cost \u00a389 \u2013 but it didn\u2019t matter, I\u2019d seen the soul of the world.\n\nOf course a couple of hours later I was struggling to retain my sense of \u201cbliss\u201d and was starting to come down into a more familiar state of advanced sulking and blame (why hadn\u2019t Geoff been keeping an eye on my jacket, what was the point in marrying a man who let me lose my outer garments?).\n\nIn order to distract myself I switched on the telly, only to witness Boris Johnson behaving like a third rate floundering club comic and then (because what else can you do?) Geoff got on the organ and accompanied the news with a booming funeral dirge whilst I drank a big glass of wine and tried to decide whether to laugh or cry, before going online and ordering a new jacket.", "description": "I\u2019ve been on one of those new-fangled \u201cstaycations\u201d, a week in an Airbnb\u00a0bungalow in Cornwall, where the television sat on top of a massive wood veneered electric organ.\u00a0 When played, this musical beast made such a mournfully nostalgic sound that I was immediately transported back to the 1970\u2019s and instantly forgot about a few missing mod cons.
