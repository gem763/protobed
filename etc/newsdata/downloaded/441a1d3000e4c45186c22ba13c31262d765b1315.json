They are demanding affordable housing for students.", "language": "en", "text": "Along with familiar issues such as contract length, benefits and class sizes, one of the core demands of the teachers union is not explicitly about their work environment but rather community justice: access to affordable housing.\n\nThis contract negotiation marks the first time the union has expressly called on the city to address systemic housing equity (Illinois law restricts the set of issues over which teachers may legally strike). It\u2019s part of a growing movement, spearheaded by teacher and other labor unions, focused more broadly on issues affecting their community for what\u2019s often called \u201cbargaining for the common good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTeachers are members of communities and increasingly struggle with their affordability; that [teacher unions] are centralizing affordability for their students shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise,\u201d said Karla Walter, director of employment policy at the Center for American Progress. Teachers unions in Los Angeles and Minneapolis have emphasized issues like affordable housing, restorative justice and sanctuary protections for immigrants in their contract negotiations.\n\nHousing is especially critical in Chicago, where a mix of historic segregation and disinvestment in nonwhite communities, coupled with a growing affordable-housing crisis, has hit black residents especially hard; black residents were Chicago\u2019s largest demographic in 2000, but the population has shrunk by nearly a quarter since then, according to census data.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the data of what\u2019s happening in Chicago, the city is losing people, but if you drill down into the numbers, you see that it\u2019s really these historically disinvested neighborhoods on the south and west sides, while other parts of the city are growing,\u201d said Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong Chicago\u2019s black population that remains, thousands face increasingly few housing options. Doug Schenkelberg, executive director for the Chicago Coalition of the Homeless, notes that roughly 81 percent of CPS homeless population are black students, although they constitute little more than a third of the overall student population.\n\nAccording to the district\u2019s 2018 figures, more than 16,450 of its students experience some form of homelessness \u2014 and that\u2019s a conservative estimate, Schenkelberg said.\n\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s an undercut, because that\u2019s a self-reported number,\u201d Schenkelberg said. Chicago\u2019s homeless youth population is more obscured because 90 percent of them are not necessarily living on the streets but are \u201cdoubled up\u201d: sleeping in cars or on floors or relatives\u2019 couches in what are indoor but still itinerant situations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nElementary special-education teacher and CTU delegate Katie Osgood is among the CPS teachers who have students leave school each day unsure of where they\u2019ll sleep that night.\n\nAt her previous school, Osgood recalled having a 6-year-old student who was disabled and had a mother living in a shelter. The student and her siblings lived with an elderly, distant relative during the week and bounced around to different shelters with their mother on weekends.\n\n\u201cOn Monday mornings, this little girl would be traumatized. It was understandable how her mood would shift day-to-day,\u201d Osgood said. The instability made it hard to fit in much instruction time. \u201cWe had to find out if she had food and clean clothes. This is what our little guys deal with.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchenkelberg said doubled-up situations aren\u2019t included in the criteria for federal money to address homelessness, although the Department of Education does count the doubled-up population in its student homelessness totals.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe include them because whether you\u2019re on the streets or someone\u2019s basement floor, the effects are the same,\u201d Schenkelberg said. He noted that in addition to the trauma students experience from housing instability, a lack of a permanent home can mean itinerant students, who may not live in the same neighborhood week to week, also lack a permanent school community.\n\nTeachers are demanding that the city commit to creating sustainable housing, housing subsidies for lower-paid school staffers such as aides, and a support system for homeless students.\n\nAD\n\nLightfoot\u2019s office deferred to CPS for comment. In response, CPS spokeswoman Emily Bolton shared an Oct. 8 statement from Lightfoot\u2019s office, noting that despite developments in the negotiations since then, the city\u2019s position on housing remained the same: \u201cAffordable housing is a critical issue that affects residents across Chicago, and everyone\u2019s voices need to be heard during this process. As such, the CTU collective bargaining agreement is not the appropriate place for the City to legislate its affordable housing policy,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nAD\n\nLightfoot has accused the union of stalling on contract negotiations over the housing issue \u2014 an assertion CTU spokeswoman Chris Geovanis said is untrue.\n\n\u201cWe presented our proposals, including on supports for homeless students and affordable housing for CPS families and workers, as a package to CPS, on January 15,\u201d Geovanis told The Washington Post in an email. Geovanis said it was the city that volunteered to discuss housing at bargaining, but that the talk \u201cwas literally about 20 minutes in length last week.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne wonders if [the city] finally invited a discussion about this set of proposals simply to be able to complain to the press that \u2018housing demands\u2019 are holding up bargaining. CPS is holding up bargaining,\u201d Geovanis wrote.\n\nCPS support staff have similarly set strike dates of October 17.\n\nAD\n\nIn Chicago, a person would have to earn $23 an hour to afford an average two-bedroom apartment at fair market rent, Schenkelberg said; Chicago teachers and other municipal employees are required to live within city limits, per employment eligibility rules. CPS teachers with 10 years of experience and an advanced degree can earn a salary of about $82,630 a year; paraprofessionals in the classroom, like teacher assistants or special ed classroom aides, earn around $34,000 annually.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s generally accepted that within the school system, it\u2019s important to make sure kids are fed,\u201d Schenkelberg said, citing federally funded breakfast and lunch programs. \u201cWe know whether a kid has access to healthy food impacts their educational opportunities. That\u2019s a generally accepted principle; there\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t be talking about housing in the same way.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The powerful union is flexing its muscle in an effort that suggests schools should lift their surrounding neighborhoods.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TUjfZanxcV_GD_EJxyWI6O3tGHQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MMP7DIHO4MI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
