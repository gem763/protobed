You have to rise above the abuse on social media, that's one of the sad things about social media.\n\n'All you can do is do your best, accept the judges' decision and move on.

The couple I\u2019d like to save is Mike and Katya.'\n\nMotsi Mabuse chose to save Catherine and Johannes, saying: 'I felt a strong performance, stronger body actions, stronger leg actions.'\n\nNext up was Bruno Tonioili, who said: 'It\u2019s hard because you\u2019ve both done very, very well, but purely based on tonight I have to save the couple that got me tingling a little bit more and I have to save Catherine and Johannes.'\n\nLeft with the deciding vote, head judge Shirley opined: 'Well, I thought both couples really stepped it up a notch and this is always the most difficult decision for me.\n\nWow! Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice earned the highest score of the series with their 'phenomenal' foxtrot on Saturday\n\n'But based on a good focus, difficult content, with some really beautiful footwork in there with stronger technical skills for me, cleaner and polished. I\u2019m going to save Mike and Katya.'\n\nOn Saturday night, Michelle Visage and her professional partner Giovanni Pernice topped the leaderboard during the spooky Halloween special.\n\nThe RuPaul's Drag Race judge impressed with a Gothic foxtrot to the Addams Family theme tune by Vic Mizzy, which earned them three tens to get 39 points at the end of the show.\n\nGiovanni's girlfriend Ashley Roberts supported the duo from the audience, cheering them on as Shirley dubbed their performance 'phenomenal'.\n\nDelighted: Ashley Roberts watched the pair from the sidelines and cheered them on ecstatically after their impressive dance was over\n\nShe said: 'Lovely musicality. It was my favourite number so far.'\n\nBruno added: 'You managed to combine the classic, the gothic and the sassy. The characterisation was so perfect.'\n\nEver the critic, Craig struggled to find anything negative in the dance, but eventually said: 'I was desperately looking for something wrong with it and I actually found one little thing - a little bit of gapping. I absolutely loved it. It was gorgeous.'\n\nWhile Motsi branded the dance 'sensational', she added: 'My little dancing heart was very very happy because I got all those technical bits. I got everything I wanted. That was out of this world.'", "description": "The dancer, 30, put on a leggy display in a plunging blue satin gown alongside Mike, 53, who put on a brave face as they arrived at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London on Monday for the awards.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock", "Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/19/20293280-0-image-a-28_1572289359199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
