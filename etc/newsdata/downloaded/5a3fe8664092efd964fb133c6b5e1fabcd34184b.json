How much? You want me to give up a quarter of a million pounds?\n\nI have been a Hargreaves Lansdown customer for more than two decades, valuing its customer service. But events this year, including the Woodford debacle, led me to reassess.\n\nWhat concerns me most is its refusal to cut the basic charge of 0.45 per cent a year for holding investment funds.\n\nHargreaves is to scrap the \u00a325 per fund charge for transferring out, and eight other charges but not the basic charge of 0.45 per cent a year for holding investment funds\n\nLast month, Hargreaves announced the scrapping of the \u00a325 per fund charge for transferring out, and eight other charges.\n\nSo it's time to do some sums.\n\nHargreaves argues that its holding fee is offset by lower fund charges.\n\nSo I went through my investments, adding the platform charge and fund charge, to compare the cost of investing with Hargreaves Lansdown against Fidelity and AJ Bell.\n\nThe results made uncomfortable reading.\n\nIf I live to an average age for a man, I can expect to lose more than a quarter of a million pounds as a result of charges.\n\nPaying for the DIY investing platform\n\nHargreaves offers a good website and a decent app for my phone. But my cycling app costs \u00a310 a year, so the thousands I am paying for an investment app feel a little stiff.\n\nThe firm charges 0.45 per cent on the first \u00a3250,000 of fund investments, compared with AJ Bell's 0.25 per cent.\n\nHargreaves charges 0.25 per cent from \u00a3250,000, then 0.1 per cent over \u00a31 million. AJ Bell charges 0.1 per cent and 0.05 per cent.\n\nBoth treat each account separately, with the top charge applying on the first \u00a3250,000 no matter how much is invested.\n\nA couple who each have a Sipp and an Isa could be charged the top rate on the first \u00a3250,000 in each. That would be \u00a34,500 in fees for Hargreaves, against \u00a32,500 at AJ Bell.\n\nFidelity charges 0.35 per cent on the first \u00a3250,000 but if one customer holds more than this, then all living in that household pay 0.2 per cent.\n\nA husband and wife each holding \u00a3250,000 in both a Sipp and an Isa would pay \u00a32,000 on the \u00a31 million invested.\n\nMost couples split investments between them and hold some money in Isas, Sipps, and possibly a separate investment account.\n\nAs far as Mrs H and I are concerned, this is a fair figure for comparison.\n\nWhat about fund costs?\n\nBut what of lower fund charges? Let's take the popular Lindsell Train Global Equity fund, for which Hargreaves charges 0.5 per cent, AJ Bell 0.65 per cent and Fidelity 0.65 per cent.\n\nAdd that to the platform charge and you could pay \u00a395 a year for every \u00a310,000 held with Hargreaves, \u00a390 with AJ Bell and \u00a385 with Fidelity's household pricing.\n\nIt's a similar story with other funds I hold, such as Threadneedle European Select and JP Morgan Emerging Markets.\n\nHargreaves may have a lower fund charge, but in most cases this is not enough to wipe out the cost of its higher holding fee.\n\nWith some, such as Fundsmith Equity and Baillie Gifford American, the fund charge is the same at all three firms. With the latter, for every \u00a310,000 it would cost \u00a372 a year at Fidelity, \u00a377 at AJ Bell and \u00a397 at Hargreaves.\n\nHargreaves may have a lower fund charge, but in most cases this is not enough to wipe out the cost of its higher holding fee\n\nBut with investment trusts and shares things change\n\nThings get more complicated for investment trusts, exchange-traded funds and shares where firms operate an overall cap on the charge.\n\nAJ Bell charges a maximum \u00a330 a year on Isas and \u00a3100 on Sipps against Hargreaves' \u00a3200 on pensions and \u00a345 on Isas. Fidelity adopts a \u00a345 overall cap.\n\nI hold a number of investment trusts including Scottish Mortgage, some ETFs (which track the UK and U.S stock markets) and some individual shares including Fevertree, which I bought when the price lost its fizz over the summer.\n\nI am paying the maximum \u00a3245 a year to hold these at Hargreaves, and Mrs H is paying a similar amount.\n\nHigher fees cost us in opportunity too\n\nSwitching would save us a four-figure sum on our total charges every year.\n\nThe key thing to consider is that every \u00a31 not invested this year is missed future investment growth.\n\nThis accumulates with the pounds not invested next year. If we lose \u00a3100 a year in charges, the lost investment growth over 20 years would be around \u00a33,300, assuming our investments return 5 per cent a year.\n\nSo \u00a31,000 extra charges a year means \u00a333,000 of lost growth.\n\nWhen I add platform and fund charges together, the potential lost growth stretches way beyond \u00a3250,000 over the next 20 years \u2014and somewhat more if our investments grow as I hope.\n\nSurely I must do what I can to reduce these.\n\nThere are other charges to consider, too \u2014 but because most of us buy and hold for long periods, these are, therefore, the most significant.\n\nI won't be taking my money to AJ Bell because the firm still has exit fees.\n\nBut I am planning to shift some money to Fidelity to test the water. If I'm happy with the service, then the rest will follow.\n\nHargreaves says: 'There are no other planned changes to our charging structure.'\n\nAJ Bell says: 'We'd like to see any changes [to exit fees] made by the regulator applied to the whole industry, not just the platforms.'\n\n> Essential reading: The best (and cheapest) DIY investing platforms and their fees", "description": "I have been a Hargreaves Lansdown customer for more than two decades, valuing its customer service.
