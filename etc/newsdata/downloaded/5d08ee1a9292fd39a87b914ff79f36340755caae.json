Desperate for a pee? Check.", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to Declassified, a weekly column looking at the lighter side of politics. You can find it in POLITICO's weekly print edition and online on Fridays.\n\nFASHION POLICE\n\nMargrethe Vestager certainly came prepared for her hearing in front of MEPs. She was even wearing her lucky dress, which she puts on for the more important meetings. But it was a risk as it's a camouflage number, and some of the MEPs may not have been able to see her (maybe that was the point and perhaps she should have lent it to Janusz Wojciechowski and Sylvie Goulard).\n\nBut do other politicians have go-to outfits for those special occasions? It seems they do...\n\nBoris Johnson, for example, wears a dark blue or gray suit whenever he's going to tell a massive lie and Donald Trump makes sure his red tie is almost down to his navel just before he sits down to fire off incomprehensible tweets.\n\nThere are other techniques for coping with a potentially stressful situation. David Cameron employed the \"full bladder\" technique to achieve maximum focus when at tense EU summits. Cameron revealed after a 2011 summit that during a formal dinner and subsequent horse-trading into the early hours, he remained intentionally \"desperate for a pee.\"\n\nCameron apparently got the idea after watching a documentary about the late Conservative politician Enoch Powell, who said (don't worry, this one's not racist): \"You should do nothing to decrease the tension before making a big speech. If anything, you should seek to increase it.\"\n\nDON'T MENTION THE WAR\n\nDid Dominic Cummings put on a German accent when he and Boris Johnson decided to brief that Angela Merkel \u2014 a politician so used to sitting on the fence in terms of her public utterances that they invented a word for it: merkeln (to hold off on a decision or not to give an opinion) \u2014 had hardened the EU position, insisting that Northern Ireland remain part of the EU's customs territory, and in alignment with EU regulations \"forever\"? It does sound like the kind of expensively educated jape they'd enjoy. Of course the British press lapped it up, just as they did when Merkel told Johnson during the summer that they could \"maybe\" find a Brexit solution \"in the next 30 days,\" when what she actually meant was \"Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Idiot.\"\n\nTURKEYS VOTE FOR CHRISTMAS\n\nItalian lawmakers voted to reduce the number of ... Italian lawmakers. The lower house approved a law to reduce the number of MPs from 630 to 400 and senators from 315 to 200 (although it'll need approval via a referendum). The 5Star Movement reckons the move will save \u20ac1 billion over 10 years, which they will spend on sunglasses.\n\nCAPTION COMPETITION\n\n\"My message to Turkey?\"\n\nCan you do better?
