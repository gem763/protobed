On Friday morning the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., condemned it on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nHey @NYTimes and MSM. Since you had time to thoroughly cover a stupid and tasteless meme seen by 8 people with incredible outrage, I figured you should dedicate the same time and outrage to THIS BILLBOARD IN TIMES SQUARE you hypocrites!\n\nUnless of course you\u2019re just full of shit. pic.twitter.com/fsEF6ClRuv \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 18, 2019\n\nThe campaign began with \u201ca lightning bolt of inspiration\u201d over the summer, Dhvani\u2019s chief executive, Avi Brown, said in an interview Friday with The Post. The billboard image shows a Trump impersonator being tied up by model Michal Mesa, a Marine Corps veteran and middle school teacher.\n\nSymbolism figures heavily in the photo, Brown said. The red-white-and-blue rope was inspired by Wonder Woman\u2019s \u201ctruth lasso,\u201d while the looming storm \u201crepresents the inevitable and supernatural power of justice.\u201d The impersonator\u2019s face, he said, is pixelated, though that is not obvious in photographs. \u201cWe certainly know who it evokes, but it\u2019s not that person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a metaphorical statement.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe marketing campaign, which was photographed in August, also includes other photos of a Trump impersonator being bound, gagged and shushed. In one photo, a model is holding his phone while he is sitting on a golden toilet, pants pulled down around his ankles. In another, a woman is pulling a piece of duct tape over his mouth.\n\n\u201cThis is about giving a voice to women,\u201d said Brown, 46, who founded the company last year. \u201cOur intent is for our brand to stand for progressive change in the face of what we perceive to be steps backwards in the evolution of our country.\u201d\n\nThe billboard, he said, has increased traffic to the company\u2019s website and social media accounts. Sales are also up, though he declined to offer specifics.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never taken a political stand before but frankly, we were fed up,\u201d Brown said, adding he was inspired by Nike\u2019s advertising campaign with Colin Kaepernick \u2014 the former NFL quarterback who sparked a movement and incurred Trump\u2019s wrath by taking a knee during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police brutality. \u201cThis is just saying: Let\u2019s put a gag order on him. Enough is enough. We support impeachment.\u201d\n\nBrown would not say how much the company was paying for the billboard on Seventh Avenue between 47th and 48th streets, in one of the world\u2019s most visible corridors, but advertising experts said a Times Square advertisement could easily cost tens of thousands of dollars per month.\n\nThe billboard emerged just days after a spoof video of Trump violently stabbing and shooting critics, including journalists and politicians, was shown at his Florida golf resort. The clip sparked a backlash, with many blaming Trump, who often uses inflammatory language against critics. The White House said Monday that the president had not seen the clip, \u201cbut based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump Jr. referred to the incident in his Friday tweet.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said in a tweet directed at the New York Times and other media outlets, \u201cSince you had time to thoroughly cover a stupid and tasteless meme seen by 8 people with incredible outrage, I figured you should dedicate the same time and outrage to THIS BILLBOARD IN TIMES SQUARE.\u201d\n\nSome of the nation\u2019s largest retailers, including Walmart, Patagonia and Levi Strauss, have become increasingly outspoken during the Trump era, tackling such hot-button issues as gun control, immigration and the environment.\n\n\u201cExecutives are feeling pressure to take a stand on social issues,\u201d Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said in a phone call from Times Square. \u201cThis is a reflection of how unusual our political situation is at the moment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said the billboard did not appear to be attracting any particular attention on Friday afternoon \u2014 it is placed high off the ground, among more prominent signs \u2014 though a few passersby paused to take photos. Another billboard, placed right below Dhvani\u2019s, features pop-art of Trump as an alien.\n\n\u201cPeople want to do business with companies that stand for something,\u201d said Anthony Johndrow, chief executive of Reputation Economy Advisors, a consultancy in New York. \u201cIt makes sense to not just take a stand, but to take a very aggressive stand.\u201d\n\nBrown, for his part, says he is rebranding Dhvani as an \u201cActiv(ist)Wear\u201d company and will donate a portion of its proceeds to nonprofits that provide health care to women. He says the retailer is specifically speaking out against the Trump administration\u2019s Title X \u201cgag rule,\u201d which blocks federal funding for health care clinics that refer patients for abortions. More than 4 million women \u2014 many of them low-income and minorities \u2014 rely on Title X for health care. (Planned Parenthood, which served 40 percent of Title X patients, withdrew from the federal program earlier this year in protest.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe believe in capitalism,\u201d Brown said. \u201cEvery dollar we spend is a choice. We vote with our dollars every single day.\u201d\n\nBut a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood said the organization did not endorse the billboard and would not accept funds raised by the campaign.\n\n\u201cOur staff members have faced threats and acts of violence for doing their jobs, and many of our patients turn to us as their safe space for care after facing violence in their lives,\" Melanie Newman, senior vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. \"We do not condone violence or violent imagery against anyone.\u201d\n\nSome critics said the billboard was more a publicity stunt than a political stand. It was unclear, they said, how an ad espousing violence against the president had anything to do with sports bras and yoga pants.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is an outsized punch, but what\u2019s the real objective here?\u201d said Chris Allieri, a crisis management expert and founder of Mulberry & Astor, a public relations firm in New York. \u201cI just don\u2019t know that this is an effective way to change the world. But at the same time, if their goal is to get exposure and sell leggings, well, maybe it\u2019s worked.\u201d\n\nHe likened the \u201cextreme\u201d image to a 2017 photo of Kathy Griffin holding a prop of Trump\u2019s severed head, which led to swift backlash against the comedian.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the power is in the ballot box,\u201d Allieri said. \u201cIt\u2019s not at the cash register \u2014 what we purchase is one very small piece of the puzzle.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Portland-based Dhvani says it\u2019s taking a stand for women, but critics say it's all about shock value.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hnYZmScZHeFJUDJQSbHXlhkQrRQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HLYTBAHRYMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
