After multiple failed attempts to get justice for what Lee did, Robert lost control and picked up a shovel, before hitting the rapist on the back of the head \u2014 and he was charged for the crime as a result.\n\nHe ended up pleading guilty so that he could save Victoria having to lie on his behalf in court, and since then he\u2019s been enjoying the free time he\u2019s got left with husband Aaron (Danny Miller). On Robert\u2019s current state of mind, Ryan said: \u2018He\u2019s waiting for the inevitable.He is however, optimistic that it is going to only be a short amount of time that he\u2019s going to be away for.\u2019\n\n\u2018I believe, worst case scenario \u2013 only a couple of years. He is quite confident in the fact that he has pled guilty so sentencing will be a bit more lenient.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert\u2019s circumstances are set to worsen in the coming episodes, as he learns that Lee has passed away in hospital. The ramifications that the rapist\u2019s death will have on his prison sentence is the main cause of concern, as it\u2019s now incredibly likely that he\u2019ll be charged with murder for what he did to the young man.\n\nRobert understandably struggles to process this information, but Liv (Isobel Steele) offers up a solution, when she suggests that he and Aaron go on the run together.\n\nRyan said: \u2018The news has just been broken to them so they haven\u2019t really got a plan, they are going to have to take it as it comes. It means some very emotional goodbyes to some people in the village, but they have to be quick and there are some people they don\u2019t even get the chance to because there just isn\u2019t time.\u2019\n\n\u2018The police are literally on their way so they have to be fast and quickly make it out of the village. They really believe they are going to stay on the run and make it work. There were very emotional goodbyes with a real sense of urgency.\u2019\n\nRobert and Aaron bid farewell to their nearest and dearest before heading off to begin their new adventure, but whether or not they manage to evade the law remains to be seen.\n\nEither way, leaving Emmerdale will no doubt be a tough task for Ryan, considering he\u2019s been a huge part of the soap since 2014. On his departure, he said: \u2018I will miss the show massively, it has been a huge part of my life for the last few years. I love working here, I love the people that I work with and it\u2019s going to be very emotional leaving.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "'It means some very emotional goodbyes.'", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15_10_emm_robert_aaron_01sgsgsggagsgasgasg-3a74_1570603970.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
