Really enjoyed it,\u201d said Vettel who produced a perfect lap to outqualify his teammate for the first time in 10 races since the Canadian Grand Prix in June.\n\n\u201cPole was not possible, Seb was too quick,\u201d said Leclerc. \u201cCongratulations to him.\u201d\n\nThe Mercedes pair had been consistently fastest in Friday practice, and in the first two qualifying sessions on Sunday, but had no answer to Ferrari when it mattered.\n\n\u201cWe always knew Ferrari might have something in reserve to turn things up,\u201d said Bottas. \u201cNothing is lost yet, let\u2019s see in a few hours.\u201d\n\nThe session kicked off what was being dubbed \u201cSuzuka Super Sunday\u201d containing both qualifying and the race because of the track having been safely locked down Saturday as Typhoon Hagibis roared past.\n\nThe Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Alex Albon were fifth and sixth with the top ten being completed by the McLarens of Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris in seventh and eight, the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly in ninth and the Haas of Romain Grosjean.\n\nIt was only the fifth time in Formula One history that qualifying had taken place on a Sunday, and the third time at Suzuka after the 2004 and 2010 race weekends were also disrupted by inclement weather.\n\nThe race will start as originally scheduled at 2.10pm (0510 GMT) after a condensed weekend where Saturday\u2019s third practice session was cancelled and qualifying shifted to Sunday morning.\n\nThe blowy conditions caught out a few drivers with Robert Kubica becoming the first casualty right at the start of qualifying.\n\nThe Williams driver ran wide in the tailwind at turn 18 and crashed his Williams into the barriers opposite the pit lane at the start of his first flying lap to bring out a red flag.\n\nNo sooner had the session been restarted then Kevin Magnussen stacked his Haas into the barriers in almost exactly the same place to bring out a second red flag.\n\nDaniel Ricciardo was the first major surprise of the day as his Renault struggled with balance in the gusts and could only clock 16th fastest to be eliminated in the first session.", "description": "Suzuka (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Sebastian Vettel produced an epic lap at Suzuka on Sunday as his Ferrari took pole position for the typhoon-affected Japanese", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/01f834_ferrari-sebastian-vettel-clocked-brilliant-1min-27-064sec-two-tenths-quicker-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
