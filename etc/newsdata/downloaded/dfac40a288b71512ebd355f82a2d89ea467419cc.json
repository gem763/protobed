It could push BJP\u2019s tally to within sniffing distance of a majority, and along with the support of allies, see him return for a second term\n\n220-230 Ahead of 2014, there was a \u201c160 club\u201d inside BJP and outside as well, which believed that Modi\u2019s lack of \u201cacceptability\u201d will mean a compromise choice for PM. This has now been replaced by a \u201c220 club\u201d that similarly feels current and would-be allies will seek Modi\u2019s replacement. But BJP may well insist that Modi be PM or choose to sit in opposition\n\n160-180 BJP may still look to lead the government with allies but the task becomes steeper.
