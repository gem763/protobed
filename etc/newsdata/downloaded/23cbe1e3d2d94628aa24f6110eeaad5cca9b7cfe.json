While businesses pulled back, shoppers continued to spend.\n\nBut a prolonged surge in gasoline prices after the attacks on oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia could undermine that phenomenon and increase the risk of a recession.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly not a positive, and it adds a negative to the outlook,\u201d said Steve Blitz, chief United States economist at T.S. Lombard, an independent research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s another straw on the camel\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s nearly 15 percent spike in oil prices to $62.90 a barrel isn\u2019t big enough to bring on a recession \u2014 it only returns crude prices to where they were this spring. And the economy expanded from 2011 to 2014 even when prices were above $100 a barrel.", "description": "The spike in oil prices after the drone attacks in Saudi Arabia won\u2019t start a recession.
