(AP) - Derek Mason\u2019s solution with Vanderbilt mired in a horrendous start and coming off arguably the worst loss of his six seasons is work harder and stick together.\n\nThe coach is confident he and his staff can turn things around.\n\nMason, 25-43 in his tenure at Vanderbilt and just 1-5 this season, said Tuesday he wants the Commodores to trust their training and stick with the process heading into Saturday\u2019s matchup at home against No. 22 Missouri.\n\n\u201cGrab an oar and start rowing because that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to get there, and that\u2019s what this team needs OK?\u201d Mason said. \u201cWe need to continue to invest in the answers that are inside the building because the schemes, I mean they\u2019re good schemes. I think we got good players, I think we got good coaches. Now what we got to do is play good football. That\u2019s the answer.\u201d\n\nVanderbilt is coming off a 34-14 loss to UNLV despite being a 15 1/2-point favorite last weekend. That\u2019s why Mason said the quarterback job is up for grabs between Riley Neal and Deuce Wallace, though both played in the loss to UNLV. Neal was 11 of 25 for 104 yards and an interception, while Wallace was 5 of 16 for 36 yards.\n\nThat loss has made Mason\u2019s job security a major question even though he just received a contract extension in February after athletic director Malcolm Turner started on the job Feb. 1. Defensive lineman Drew Birchmeier said the UNLV loss was frustrating but agreed with Mason that the Commodores just need to keep working.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of coaches in the stands,\u201d Birchmeier said.\n\nMason also encouraged Vanderbilt fans to support the Commodores, remembering the players are men between the ages of 18 and 22 trying to figure things out. Asked about a coaching change, Mason said he believes in his coaches and compared making a change to being in battle and shooting someone beside you.\n\n\u201cThis is about family,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThis is about trust, This is about having some integrity. This is about making a march. It\u2019s about the work, so let\u2019s make sure we do every bit of it.\u201d\n\nGerry Gdowski is in his first season as offensive coordinator for Vanderbilt, which is last in the Southeastern Conference in total offense and points scored per game, averaging 338.83 yards and just 18 points. The Commodores are 119th out of 130 FBS in scoring per game.\n\nOn defense, they rank No. 124 in total defense, giving up 482.7 yards a game with defensive coordinator Jason Tarver in his second season.\n\nMason said the Commodores\u2019 issues revolve around practicing well but not following through in games.\n\n\u201cIf I had an answer for that, we\u2019d be on the other side of it \u2026,\u201d Mason said. \u201cI\u2019m searching for that answer right now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.
