Sean Casten (D-IL) \u2014 and discovered that voters do not like impeachment. In fact, many support President Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nCasten defeated long-term incumbent Republican Peter Roskam last fall in the 6th congressional district of Illinois, in the far western suburbs of Chicago, as part of a nationwide Democratic sweep of suburban districts.\n\nBut his left-wing policies and bare-knuckle style were never a good fit \u2014 and now he is facing pushback from constituents who are upset that he is backing Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and the left in their attempt to force Trump out of office.\n\nDesiderio \u2014 who mis-identifies Casten as a \u201csoft-spoken lawmaker\u201d (the Wall Street Journal called him a \u201csmash-mouth\u201d)\n\nCasten as he spoke with constituents across his district, and found that many \u201cnever thought that this particular Democrat would be leaning so forcefully into an impeachment inquiry against a Republican president.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that \u201cTrump\u2019s efforts to paint Biden as corrupt for trying to oust a prosecutor who at one point was investigating a company tied to his son Hunter appeared to resonate among his supporters who attended Casten\u2019s town halls \u2014 some of whom were wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and \u201cTrump 2020\u201d t-shirts.\u201d One constituent \u201casked Casten why he wasn\u2019t condemning Biden\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nOne constituent, Steven Wood, \u201cremains convinced that Trump did nothing wrong, and he took issue with the way Casten described the president\u2019s claims about Biden, in particular his declarative statement that Trump and his supporters are \u2018actively suppressing facts.'\u201d\n\nCasten did admit that Trump had done better than former President Barack Obama in arming Ukraine against Russia.\n\nOtherwise, Desiderio found, constituents were much more focused on public policy issues than on impeachment \u2014 even liberal constituents: \u201c[M]any liberal voters across Illinois\u2019 6th Congressional District, while supportive of the impeachment effort, don\u2019t want policy priorities like gun control and climate change to take a back seat. At one of the town halls, impeachment didn\u2019t come up even once.\u201d\n\nCasten is considered vulnerable in 2020 and may face a tough re-election fight against Republican Jeanne Ives, who narrowly lost in the GOP primary for governor in 2018 and has entered the race for the 6th.\n\nRead the full Politico article here.\n\nJoel B.
