A majority 52% support supporting the impeachment inquiry. Mary said targeting the whistle-blower. We're trying to find out about a whistle-blower. When you have a whistle-blower that reports things that were incorrect as you know and you've probably now have figured it out, the statement I made to the president of Ukraine, a good man, a nice man, new, was perfect and it's a disgrace. This whole thing is a disgrace. There's been tremendous corruption. So let's analyze this with our chief white house correspondent Jon Karl and chief legal analyst Dan Abrams and in the intro right there, the president is front and center on this. He is his defense team. Reporter: It's clear, George, that the president is directing the response to all of this himself. Both through his tweeting, some 30 tweets over the weekend, but in terms of this attack on the whistle-blower, it has been relentless. Of course, it is started by suggesting the whistle-blower or those who talked to the whistle-blower are essential agoly spies and the punishment for spying used to be death and now demanding to know to out the whistle-blower. His own aides have called the whistle-blower part of a deep state conspiracy. George, this could well be a violation of federal whistle-blower protection laws and is also the kind of thing that could end up being one of the articles of impeachment against the president intimidating the whistle-blower. The more he tries to target him. Let's bring in Dan Abrams for we just saw Rudy Giuliani get a subpoena as well, of course, he's the president's personal attorney. He says he's deliberating whether or not he's going to comply with the subpoena but does he really have a choice? No. I mean, his arguments are likely to be very weak. First of all to get attorney/client privilege you have to be serving as the attorney. Rudy Giuliani has said I wasn't acting as a lawyer. I was acting as a straight and out -- there's no attorney/client, period he could argue, you know what, there are instances where I was acting as his attorney, okay. Fair enough, you've got a problem, a, that congress can typically compel even attorney/client protected privilege, B, you've got the possibility of what's called waiver, meaning when he's out there talking about it publicly there is no more attorney/client privilege. The whole point of the attorney/client privilege is to say, we can have a private conversation. We can talk about these things. If Rudy Giuliani has been out talking about those conversations, that would also If he doesn't comply that could become an article of impeachment. Meantime, we have this extraordinary situation where the attorney general is out traveling overseas trying to enlist foreign nations in this investigation of the Russia investigation. Right, and what we thought was happening was that this respected former federal prosecutor John Durham was doing his own investigation and the sense was, all right, there's a level of Independence to this. It's being handed off to Durham, he will be investigated. If Barr himself is out actually interviewing witnesses and talking to people, then Durham isn't really doing the investigation. Barr's doing the investigation. That's certainly running the risk of giving the impression that this is an investigation for the president to retaliate against Robert Mueller as opposed to an independent one. Meantime, any sense the white house is developing a more comprehensive coordinated strategy? Reporter: It doesn't look that way, George. In fact, one indicator of this, as late as yesterday, white house legal team was still trying to get a definitive answer as to whether or not secretary of state Mike Pompeo was on the president's call with president zelensky of Ukraine. Of course, it turns out he was but they didn't know that for sure until yesterday. And, of course, he could have just told them. Thanks very much.
