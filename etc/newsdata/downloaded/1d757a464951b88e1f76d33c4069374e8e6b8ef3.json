In his memoir, Booker described a (sort of) standoff with his political rival when he was on the Newark city council, Mayor Sharpe James. Booker wrote, \u201csome people probably expected me to take a jab at the mayor or to slight him in some way.\u201d But after more than a week of fasting, \u201cI felt light; I felt no negative emotions whatsoever.\u201d Same goes for Biden. While Biden pulls it off better, when criticized for Trump-esque tough talk, he has been pressured into apologizing. If you\u2019re going to mimic Trump, go full Trump and never regret. But don\u2019t swing between being a fighter and being a lover.\n\nWhen confronted with Trump\u2019s attacks, my worry is a male opponent might prove that boys will in fact be boys. But women are less susceptible to this particular variety of bullying. Maybe that\u2019s because it\u2019s harder to go after a woman in the same way, as Hillary Clinton\u2019s Senate debates in 2000 with then-Republican Rep. Rick Lazio showed, when his invasion of her personal space didn\u2019t go over well with people watching. Or maybe it\u2019s because so many of Trump\u2019s attacks appear aimed at his rivals\u2019 masculinity\u2014but women, of course, are safe on that front.", "description": "", "authors": ["Philippe Reines", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
