(AP) - The State newspaper in Columbia has issued an apology for a headline connecting the Hilinski\u2019s Hope foundation to South Carolina\u2019s 34-14 loss Saturday at Missouri where Ryan Hilinski was the Gamecocks quarterback.\n\nThe story about the game in print editions carried the headline, \u201cHilinski Hope Sinks. \u201d Hilinski\u2019s Hope is a foundation set up by the Hilinski family after Tyler Hilinski, Ryan\u2019s older brother, committed suicide in 2018 while a quarterback at Washington State.\n\nThe paper received criticism on social media and from the university, which issued a statement against the headline Sunday.\n\nThe newspaper said on social media the link reference to the foundation was unintentional, but there was \u201cno excuse\u201d for the wording. It reached out to the family and university to express its regrets.\n\nRyan Hilinski is a freshman who became South Carolina starter earlier this month with a season-ending injury to senior Jake Bentley.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The State newspaper in Columbia has issued an apology for a headline connecting the Hilinski's Hope foundation to South Carolina's 34-14 loss Saturday at Missouri where Ryan Hilinski was the Gamecocks quarterback.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
