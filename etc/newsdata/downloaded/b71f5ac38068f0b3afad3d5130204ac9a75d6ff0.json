And it now looks as if holiday shopping on Saturdays will be even brighter than the new norm for yours truly.\n\nThank you, TarJay.\n\nThe discounter said Tuesday it will power the website of the rebooted Toys R Us website. Shoppers head to the new Toys R Us website \u2014 which has been re-launched ahead of several store openings this holiday season by the defunct toy chain\u2019s former chief merchant turn CEO of Tru Kids Brands Richard Barry \u2014 hit the buy button, and they are linked to the same product page at Target.\n\nSuffice it to say this is a win win for both parties.\n\nFor Toys R Us and Barry, it joins forces with a powerful brand in Target for its return to life this crucial holiday shopping season. What better plan of attack than to link up with a retailer in Target that, for lack of other words, has been on fire this year in stores and online. And obviously, using Target\u2019s supply chain will free up resources for Barry to continue plotting out the Toys R Us retail store network and adding key members to his team.\n\nAs for Target, this is another feather in its cap when it comes to the toy business. Target went through great pains to bulk up its toy department last holiday season in the absence of Toys R Us (recall they went bankrupt, all stores closed in the U.S. in early 2018), and it worked wonders for the overall performance of the business in the important fourth quarter. So, working closely with an established toy brand in Toys R Us gives Target the top of mind position among consumers as the the holiday destination for toys.\n\nDamnit, so good to see Toys R Us back in the game \u2014 I spent every weekend in there as a kid in the 1980s. I know where I am buying my toys this holiday season for my niece and nephew, Target, if for no other reason I can conjure up warm Toys R Us memories via a tap of the button online.\n\nOthers of my generation are likely to follow a similar line of thinking. In short, the Toys R Us shopping tradition is about to be passed onto the next generation of kiddies.\n\nIt\u2019s highly likely Toys R Us shops open inside Target stores within the next 24 months. If so, they would join the dozens of new Disney shops opening in Target stores \u2014 another recent win for the Target merchandising team.\n\nA year of winning for Target\n\nThat said, what\u2019s happening in Target\u2019s toy aisles isn\u2019t relegated to the toy aisles alone. Want the most straightforward reason why Target\u2019s stock price is at a record after several blowout quarters this year? Then follow my Twitter account @BrianSozzi because the great reinvention of Target has been unfolding on it for more than a year.\n\nTarget has become a vastly different place to shop in two years time thanks to an aggressive remodeling campaign by CEO Brian Cornell. I get happier when I walk through the front door, knowing full well I am entering a store that meets all of the crazy needs I have \u2014 from a fake plant in a nice vase for the kitchen to a fresh-faced energy drink with 300mg of caffeine that so happens to be sitting nearby a Beyond Meat burger package.\n\n(AP Photo/M. Spencer Green) More\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the case at Target five years ago.\n\nThe home department feels like HomeGoods lite, except you don\u2019t waste two hours in there trying to find a cool-looking paper towel holder. You can get that cool-looking paper towel holder in five minutes. The Target home goods section is like Macy\u2019s \u2014 on trend stuff, but half the price and you don\u2019t need to waste time on an escalator or wander through 75% off underwear to reach the department.\n\nThe apparel section you ask? Some of the best lit apparel displays in all of retail (it\u2019s an important selling technique) and a cut above the dying J.C. Penney (JCP). The only knock? Target still doesn\u2019t carry Nike or Under Armour gear like apparel rival Kohl\u2019s (KSS). The revamped food department \u2014 chock full of organics and brands you would think should be relegated to Whole Foods \u2014 is impressive. Want to know why Kroger\u2019s (KR) sales have sucked for a while?
