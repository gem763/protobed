On Thursday, he birdied his final four.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most pleasing thing about today,\u201d Windred said, \u201cHopefully that was my bad round and I ground it out quite well, so it\u2019s not really that bad. I\u2019m still moving forward.\n\n\u201cThe goal was basically shooting 5-under every round. So, I have a bit of work to do over the weekend, but so far, I\u2019m on track.\u201d\n\nWindred had bogeys on 11 and 15 to slip back to 8-under after nine holes. He dropped another shot at the par-4 first hole but had a pair of birdies to get him back level on the day.\n\n\u201cMorning is just a little bit of different with a little bit of that fog or whatever, but there was initially a little bit of a difference,\u201d Windred said. \u201cI prefer the afternoon, so the back nine I felt a little more comfortable with my numbers.\u201d\n\nHe had a three-putt bogey from below the hole on the par-3 fourth and then made a par save from a near-impossible stance next to a bunker on the seventh.\n\nWindred hit a draw off the tee over the trees on the par-5 eighth, his second-last of the day. After laying up, he birdied it from below the hole. On the ninth, his 15-foot putt hung on the edge but fell into the hole.\n\nImran Ali, the first player from Afghanistan to compete in the tournament, had an opening-round 96 and missed the cut. The tournament website said that Ali practices on the only golf course in his war-affected country - a nine-hole layout - but that he was working with authorities to open the first driving range.\n\nTonny Ramo of the Soloman Islands had rounds of 99-100 to finish 55 shots over par and in last place of the 120 players.\n\nThe winner of the Asia-Pacific Amateur receives an invitation to compete in next year\u2019s Masters at Augusta and the British Open, while the runner-up or other second-place finishers gets a place in final qualifying for the British Open.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Blake Windred's second round was eight strokes worse than his first, but the 21-year-old Australian still held a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the Asia Pacific Amateur.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
