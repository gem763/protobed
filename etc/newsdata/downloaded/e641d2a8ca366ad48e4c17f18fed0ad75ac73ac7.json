It will also help them to create efficiencies that would not otherwise be possible, according to a statement by the Commission.\n\n\n\n\"It is expected that the joint venture will equally benefit the South African economy as it will lead to increased foreign currency earnings, improved capacity utilisation and employment, increased passenger numbers, increased cargo capacity and increasing the route network in new markets,\" states the Commission.\n\nThe two airlines can now synchronise passenger and cargo capacity and expand their joint networks.\n\nThe exemption, in terms of the Competition Act, allows them to collaborate on the network, scheduling, revenue management and distribution across both carriers. This will enhance their existing bilateral offering.\n\nCarla da Silva, who heads up Air Mauritius Southern Africa and Latin America, recently told Fin24 that she estimates that more than 300 million people will be travelling from, to, and within Africa in the next 20 years.", "description": "SAA and Air Mauritius have been granted permission to form a joint venture on the Johannesburg and Mauritius route as well as other related routes.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8973/a2ae8947030a4014a08fd5f5128e9b23.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
