Well, not all of them, it seems.\n\nThat's because there's a new souped up version called the R.S. Trophy-R that boasts 296bhp, has been draped in carbon fibre and comes with fancy new suspension.\n\nAs a result it has set a new Nurburgring lap record for a front-wheel-drive car, making it the hot hatch dream model for any budding boy racer types.\n\nBut not many will be able to afford one... Renault has slapped a staggering price tag exceeding \u00a372,000 on the top of the range version.\n\n'How much?' Renault has caused a stir this week by revealing that it will sell a limited edition Megane for a staggering \u00a372,000\n\nJust 500 examples of the Megane R.S. Trophy-R will be made, and just 32 of those have been promised to customers in Britain.\n\nThose buyers will have to fork out a hefty sum with the entry level variant priced at \u00a351,140.\n\nAnd those who want the range-topping Nurburgring Record Pack will need to stump up \u00a372,140.\n\nThat's a whole lot of money for what is a stripped out - though super quick - hatchback, as the social media reaction to its unveiling has pointed out.\n\nResponses to various tweets about the car's price tag included one individual remarking 'someone's smoking something' while another suggested the price should include one of Renault's F1 cars and its driver.\n\nTo put the price into perspective, we've selected a few new performance cars you could get your hands on for the same amount of cash.\n\nA similar outlay could buy a high-spec Jaguar F-Type V6 or even a Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 - both of which would likely run rings around the Megane on the road and track.\n\nWould you spend \u00a372k on a Megane or one of these alternatives? Renault Megane R.S. Trophy-R Nurburgring Record Pack Price: \u00a372,140 Engine: 1.8-litre, 4-cyl turbo Power: 296bhp 0-62mph: 5.4sec Top speed: 163mph TWO PERFORMANCE CARS YOU COULD BUY INSTEAD... Jaguar F-Type V6 (380PS) Price: \u00a371,570 Engine: 3.0-litre, V6 supercharged Power: 375bhp 0-62mph: 5.5sec Top speed: 171mph Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Price: \u00a375,348 Engine: 4.0-litre, 6-cyl Power: 414bhp 0-62mph: 4.4sec Top speed: 188mph\n\nBut the R.S. Trophy-R is no run-of-the-mill family wagon.\n\nIt uses a turbocharged 1.8-litre four-cylinder petrol engine that produces 296bhp and 400Nm of peak torque.\n\nThat's not what makes it the pinnacle of hot hatches on the market today, though.\n\nRenault Sport's team has ditched 130kg of weight from the standard model, relieving it of the rear seats, thinner glass in the windows and a lighter rear axle.\n\nEven a less bulky battery and smaller infotainment touchscreen systems helps to shave a kilogram or two.\n\nThe Renault Megane R.S.S Trophy-R uses a turbocharged 1.8-litre four-cylinder petrol engine that produces 296bhp and 400Nm of peak torque\n\nThe bodywork has also been overhauled with carbon dripping from every panel - including the bonnet\n\nThe rear diffuser is also carbon fibre and the standard exhaust has been changed to a racier Akrapovic system\n\nThe bodywork has also been overhauled with carbon dripping from every panel - including the bonnet and a new rear diffuser.\n\nAs a result, the car can accelerate from zero to 62mph in 5.4 seconds and to a top speed of 163mph.\n\nIt's also dripping with the best performance parts money can buy - which you'd expect if you were handing over more than \u00a370,000 for a Renault - including an Akrapovic exhaust, Ohlins suspension and high-performance Brembo brakes.\n\nRenault Sport's team has ditched 130kg of weight from the standard model, atripping out much of the interior and switching to a smaller and lighter touchscreen system\n\nRenault Sport has also relieved the Megane of its rear seats and swapped to thinner glass for the windows\n\nThe range-topping Renault Megane R.S. Trophy-R Nurburgring Record Pack version - the one that costs \u00a372,140 - adds carbon ceramic front brake discs and gold callipers and is a like-for-like specification to the one used to set the new Nurburgring record.\n\nIt lapped the fearsome circuit in 7 minutes 40.1 seconds \u2013 three seconds quicker than the previous front-wheel-drive marker set by the Honda Civic Type R.\n\nFirst deliveries are expected in October. The big question is, would you pay such an astonishing amount of money for a Renault Megane, even if it is this quick?\n\nThe range-topping Renault Megane R.S.
