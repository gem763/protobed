Photo: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nMiley Cyrus has a new look \u2014 one that says \u201cI live by the sea and lure unsuspecting mariners to me with my bewitching music, and then devour their organs.\u201d\n\nIn recent appearances at the VMAs and New York Fashion Week, the singer has sported a blonde, banged hairstyle that appears to be completely wet, as if she had just emerged from a long day of slinking along the waters outside of her Malibu home, like a siren from The Odyssey, the one who drives Ulysses mad with her song about MDMA.\n\nCyrus debuted her new look in the midst of a summer full of personal drama. In August, she and her husband Liam Hemsworth announced they were separating after six months of marriage. Shortly after, she was seen furiously making out with Brody Jenner\u2019s ex-wife, Kaitlynn Carter, in Italy, and now the two women seem to be together, even though Kaitlynn\u2019s hair appears to be dry most of the time.\n\nShortly after she and Liam announced their separation, Miley released \u201cSlide Away,\u201d a water-based breakup single in which she says she\u2019s \u201cgonna miss these harbor lights,\u201d and invites Liam to \u201cslide away, back to the ocean,\u201d while she goes \u201cback to the city lights.\u201d She performed the song at last month\u2019s VMAs, her blonde hair slicked down and wet with what seemed to be petroleum jelly and the souls of sailors. So, actually, it seems like she\u2019s the one sliding back to the ocean?\n\nAnyway, hopefully Miley can stop Atlantis\u2019s King Orm before he declares war on the surface world.\n\nStay in touch.
