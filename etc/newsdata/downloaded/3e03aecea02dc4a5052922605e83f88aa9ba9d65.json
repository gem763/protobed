Afterward, they walked out into Times Square, where they were greeted by a billboard of his face in character and the name \u2018Arturo Castro\u2019 staring down at the crowds.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to have to change my name when I first moved to the States because I thought \u2018Arturo Castro\u2019 sounded too ethnic,\u201d he tells me. \u201c[So] to be able to see it on a billboard is a great honor.\u201d\n\nChristy Havranek/HuffPost Actor Arturo Castro says it was affirming to see his name on a billboard in Times Square.\n\nCastro, who has lived in New York for 14 years, explains how shocked he was when he first moved there and realized that he wasn\u2019t white. For a while, he tried to get rid of any traits \u2015 from his accent to his appearance \u2015 that would result in him being labeled or perceived as \u201cother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you move somewhere, you try to really adopt a culture for a bit, and that means shunning your roots a little bit to gain some separation from it,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut then, around 2011, a bunch of my friends from Guatemala moved here to be photographers and actors, and I realized my superpower is where I come from.\u201d\n\nHis pivot to lived authenticity is being reflected more broadly on television today, with shows like \u201cLos Espookys,\u201d \u201cVida\u201d and \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d marking a shift in where studios and networks are investing their time and their budgets, though there continue to be reservations about the long-term commitment to programming shows that celebrate and promote Hispanic culture in ways that are accessible to the public writ large.\n\n\u201cThe pushback used to be, \u2018We can\u2019t make any money off of an ethnic person leading a show, or a movie.\u2019 \u2019Black Panther\u2032 did a lot [to correct] that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe numbers started to prove them wrong, and Hollywood is nothing if not clever, and they smartened up pretty quick.\u201d\n\nHis comedy is typically fueled by what\u2019s irritating him. He hangs out with his writers every Tuesday, he tells me, kicking off their meetings with the same question: \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering us today?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe misrepresentation of Latin culture, particularly of Latin men, has long peeved Castro and features prominently in the show, like the \u201cWhen You\u2019re Latinx But You Can\u2019t Dance\u201d sketch.\n\nChristy Havranek/HuffPost Arturo Castro credits \"Broad City's\" creators for making his \"entire career possible.\"\n\nIt\u2019s also a trope he played with on \u201cBroad City\u201d as the series\u2019 beloved Jaim\u00e9. He still stands hard for creators Glazer and Jacobson: \u201cThey just made my entire career possible. Whenever I came into any questions, I could just always call them, and their point was always stay true to your voice, and be kind.\u201d\n\nCastro\u2019s voice rings out in \u201cAlternatino\u201d with a bite that can be surprising at times.\n\nHis comedy might once have been called \u201cbold,\u201d but in today\u2019s political climate, it feels more like \u201cessential.\u201d He pointedly satirizes some of the nation\u2019s most troubling issues, such as the Trump administration\u2019s response to the damage wrought by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico or the draconian U.S. policy of family separation\u2014 issues he says are \u201cimpossible to ignore.\u201d\n\nGun violence has been top of mind of late. An \u201cAlternatino\u201d sketch he\u2019d written about trying to explain mass shootings in the U.S. to a recent immigrant from Central America was delayed after the violent domestic terrorism gun attack in Gilroy, California. Recently, in the wake of August\u2019s devastating weekend of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, he explained on Twitter and in an op-ed in The Washington Post why he could not hold the sketch back any longer: \u201cIt will always be \u2018too soon\u2019 when gun violence happens so frequently.\u201d\n\nAnd though politics isn\u2019t the predominant mainstay of \u201cAlternatino\u201d \u2015 it takes up about a quarter of every show \u2015 his approach to covering politics is similar to his approach to covering cultural misnomers: Subvert them to the point of breaking them.", "description": "Actor, writer and comedian Arturo Castro talks about his Comedy Central show \u2018Alternatino\u2019 and challenging Latinx identity stereotypes", "authors": ["Host", "Managing Producer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93b2de2200005c01dbfb2d.jpeg?cache=drmj1yyin2&ops=1778_1000"}
