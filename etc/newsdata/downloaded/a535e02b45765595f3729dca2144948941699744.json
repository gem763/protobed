The former New York City mayor may also have become estranged from his client-in-chief.\n\nThe president, when asked at the White House on Friday whether Giuliani is still his lawyer, said \u201cI don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy.\u201d\n\nGiuliani attorney Jon Sale didn\u2019t immediately respond to calls and email messages seeking comment on the reported probe or whether he continues to represent Trump.\n\nRepresentatives for the Southern District of New York, which is leading the probe, declined to comment.\n\nOf the four men charged Thursday with funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign money into efforts to support Trump and other candidates for office, two have worked closely with Giuliani since he became Trump\u2019s personal lawyer last year.\n\nThe men -- Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman -- are represented by John Dowd, Trump\u2019s former lawyer. Dowd himself wrote last week to Democrats saying the two men wouldn\u2019t testify in the impeachment inquiries, explaining \u201cParnas and Fruman assisted Mr. Giuliani in connection with his representation of President Trump. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have also been represented by Mr. Giuliani in connection with their personal and business affairs.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump told reporters Thursday that he didn\u2019t know Parnas or Fruman. \u201cMaybe they were clients of Rudy,\u201d he added. As for photos of himself with Parnas at the White House posted on Facebook, he said it was possible \u201cbut I have pictures with everybody.\u201d\n\nParnas and Fruman had lunch with Giuliani at the Trump hotel in Washington Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported. That would have been just hours before prosecutors said the two were arrested trying to board a flight out of the country on one-way tickets. The indictment doesn\u2019t just draw Giuliani closer to prosecutors\u2019 glare; after the arrest, House Democrats subpoenaed the men\u2019s communications with Giuliani, saying \u201cThey are not exempted from this requirement merely because they happen to work with Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nCNN reported earlier Thursday that prosecutors in Manhattan are looking into Giuliani.\n\nThe timing of the arrest suggests prosecutors knew the two men were leaving the country, which means they were likely tracking the pair closely before they were apprehended.\n\n\u201cHow did the feds know, in real time, they were buying plane tickets?\u201d said John Moscow, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office. \u201cThey were probably under surveillance.\u201d\n\nAnd if they were under surveillance, then it\u2019s possible that investigators noted their recent meetings with Giuliani, he said. To that end, prosecutors might end up questioning Giuliani about whether he was aware they were planning to leave the country, among other topics.\n\nIn particular, prosecutors are likely to want to know whether the two men informed Giuliani about their plans to leave and whether they wanted to avoid testifying in the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nParnas, who was born in Ukraine, and Fruman, in Belarus, are both U.S. citizens now. The pair had been targeted by the Democrats because of their work in Kyiv over the past year with Giuliani to dig up incriminating information on Joe Biden, the leading contender to challenge Trump in next year\u2019s presidential election, and his son. Trump\u2019s efforts this summer to press the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to formally announce impeachment inquiries.\n\nAmbassador\u2019s Ouster\n\nAccording to the indictment, the men also played a role in another incident House Democrats are zeroing in on: Parnas allegedly pressed an unidentified congressman to push for the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the behest of Ukrainian government officials. The ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, was recalled in May and is scheduled to testify before the impeachment inquiry Friday. It\u2019s unclear whether she will testify.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer, is being scrutinized by federal investigators for his financial dealings following the indictment of two of his associates for violating campaign finance laws, according to a law enforcement official.The official, who asked to remain anonymous", "authors": ["Greg Farrell", "Chris Strohm"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v.EiExddO_hbLQa9lkURGw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ec9b231c77c70f2f0fff62340946c365", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
