He said he would support that legislation when the government puts it forward.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has a strategy ... he wants to be able to say to any waverers \u2018it is my deal or no deal, vote for the implementing legislation or we crash out\u2019,\u201d Letwin told parliament.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be sure that such a threat from the prime minister would work. I, despite my support for the prime minister\u2019s deal, do not believe that it is responsible to put the nation at risk by making that threat.\u201d", "description": "British lawmaker Oliver Letwin said on Saturday it was not responsible for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to threaten a choice between his Brexit deal and a no deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442653691&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0A6", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
