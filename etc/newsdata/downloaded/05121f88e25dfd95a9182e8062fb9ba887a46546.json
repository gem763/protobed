However, several other countries have taken far greater steps to change national gun laws following such incidents. Here's a look at how other nations have responded.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nJust weeks after the Christchurch mosque massacres in March, which left 50 dead, New Zealand's parliament voted almost unanimously to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern was praised for acting swiftly, vowing to end access to the weapons just days after the shootings. She also announced a buyback scheme to compensate gun owners, which could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAustralia\n\nThe turning point for Australia was April 28, 1996, when 28-year-old Martin Bryant killed 35 people at a popular tourist spot in Tasmania, wielding a military-style semi-automatic rifle.\n\nAn ambulance at the Port Arthur historic site after the mass shooting in 1996 where 35 people were killed.\n\nHigh-caliber rifles and shotguns were banned, licensing was tightened, a \"buy-back\" scheme took some 650,000 guns out of circulation and remaining firearms were registered to national standards.\n\nThe accomplishment is still regarded by many in Australia as Howard's enduring legacy.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe UK has some of the world's strictest gun-ownership laws, and it's rare for civilians to own firearms.\n\nRecent gun control measures first arrived in 1987 when Michael Ryan, 27, embarked on a bloody rampage in the southern English town of Hungerford, Berkshire. Armed with a pistol, hand grenade and an automatic rifle, he killed 16 people.\n\nThe UK reacted by banning semi-automatic and pump-action weapons . It also introduced new legislation which made it mandatory for shotgun owners to register their weapons.\n\nNine years later, another tragedy struck as 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton burst into a school in Dunblane, Scotland, with legally owned handguns. He killed 16 children (aged 5 and 6) and their teacher before taking his own life.\n\nA policeman consoles a mother and her children after they had laid a bouquet outside the school where 16 children and their teacher were killed in Dunblane.\n\nThe incident prompted widespread outrage. After a highly successful public campaign and a petition with almost 750,000 signatures, a new law was passed banning the private ownership of all handguns in the UK. (Gun laws are different in Northern Ireland.)\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the effectiveness of Britain's gun laws has been repeatedly questioned . Another mass shooting happened in 2010, when a lone gunman killed 12 people in a four-hour shooting spree in rural Cumbria, northern England. The suspect was found with two powerful rifles, one equipped with a telescopic sight.\n\nFinland\n\nTwo shootings in 2007 and 2008 prompted the Finnish government to issue new firearm regulations.\n\nFollowing those mass shootings, all new applicants for Finnish handgun licenses are required to show they've been an active member of a gun club for one year and must be vetted by a doctor and the police.\n\nThe country also raised the minimum age for purchasing licenses for short barrel weapons from 18 to 20.\n\nGermany\n\nIn 2009, 17-year-old Tim Kretschmer killed 15 people in a shooting spree in the German town of Winnenden. The government reacted by implementing a national firearms registry -- requiring owners of 5.5 million legally owned guns to register them with the government.", "description": "This weekend's mass shootings in Texas and Ohio added two more tragedies to the United States' long list of gun killings -- which its government has long struggled to prevent.", "authors": ["Bianca Britton"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180215223712-02-parkland-vigil-0215-super-tease.jpg"}
