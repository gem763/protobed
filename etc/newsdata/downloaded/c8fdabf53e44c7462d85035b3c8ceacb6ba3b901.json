One of those beneficiaries is No. 3 Roger Federer, who lost to Djokovic in a thrilling Wimbledon final in July. Federer, who has not won the U.S. Open since 2008, beat No. 15 David Goffin earlier on Sunday and will play unseeded Grigor Dimitrov in a quarterfinal.\n\nHe now has a path through the Open that no longer includes the possibility of facing Djokovic in the semifinals.\n\nBut Wawrinka has shown that he, too, must be seen as a dangerous opponent, a smart, powerful battler. He served extraordinarily well Sunday, winning 84 percent of the points on his first serve and was only broken once.\n\n\u201cMost important is the way I\u2019m playing, the way I\u2019m moving,\u201d Wawrinka said. \u201cTonight I think was really high level.\u201d\n\nThe same was not the case for Djokovic, who would not give details of his injury, other than to acknowledge that it was his left shoulder. Before the tournament began he said the shoulder was bothering him on backhands and on the toss of his serve.\n\nThe injury probably accounted for many of his 35 unforced errors in the abbreviated match. He was unable to practice the day after his first-round match, but it seemed to subside in his next two matches. There were no indications that he was in distress, until his poor play Sunday night.\n\nWawrinka said he sensed something was wrong with Djokovic, and assumed it was his balky shoulder, but was playing so well he did not change his approach. He also had a good deal more empathy for Djokovic than the fans did.", "description": "Djokovic, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, was trailing Stan Wawrinka by two sets to none on Sunday when he retired from their fourth-round match.", "authors": ["David Waldstein"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/sports/01djokovic-1sub/01djokovic-1sub-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
