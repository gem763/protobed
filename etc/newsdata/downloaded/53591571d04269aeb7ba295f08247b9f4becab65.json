No, fuck you!\u201d With his comeback, Sanders seems to be saying just that\u2014not only to any detractors ready to write him off, but to the organ pumping inside his own chest.\n\nAnd his supporters have responded.\n\n\u201cI kind of thought [his heart attack] was the end of the campaign, but the boost has been significant, and I\u2019m encouraged by it,\u201d said Quinn Miller, a 33-year-old city-government worker wearing a blue Unidos con Bernie T-shirt.\n\n\u201cIt got everyone rallied,\u201d said Erik Pye, a 45-year-old Army veteran and store owner from Brooklyn. \u201cIt gave everyone a sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nThe incident seems to have made serious again all the Sanders supporters who\u2019d recently wandered off, I observed to 28-year-old Elizabeth Johnson, who\u2019d traveled from Rhode Island with her boyfriend. \u201cSerious,\u201d she joked, \u201cas a heart attack.\u201d\n\nAt the start of Sanders\u2019s 2020 run, his aides made a point of telling reporters that his approach would be different from 2016: He would speak more personally about his life story and how his own experiences are at the root of his democratic-socialist politics\u2014an attempt to connect with voters who kept their distance four years ago. That strategy lasted one weekend. At events since then, he\u2019s often taken on the air of an annoyed grandfather who wants to say \u201cI told you so\u201d to the Democratic candidates who\u2019ve adopted some of his more progressive policies.\n\nRead: The return of Bernie Sanders is bigger than Bernie Sanders\n\nThe heart attack has given the campaign new material, and a new message. \u201cBernie\u2019s too old?\u201d asked the filmmaker Michael Moore, mocking pundits, in his endorsement speech at the rally. No, he said, what\u2019s too old is the Electoral College, a $7.25 minimum wage, and the use of fossil fuels. People are worried about Sanders\u2019s health? Moore said he\u2019s worried about the health of the planet, and the health of young black men shot by police. \u201cThe only heart attack we should be talking about is the one Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president of the United States,\u201d Moore said.\n\nIn a nod to supporters\u2019 suspicions about anti-Sanders sentiment in the Democratic Party, Nina Turner, the former Ohio state senator who is a campaign co-chair, told the crowd to beware of ageism, and noted that Sanders was the only candidate asked about his health at the Democrats\u2019 latest debate. (Of course, he\u2019s the only one who recently had a major health incident.)\n\nPerhaps most important, Sanders\u2019s heart attack seems to have encouraged Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s attention-grabbing endorsement. They had breakfast in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont, a few days before the episode, but her announcement\u2019s timing was motivated by her desire to give the campaign a boost right when Sanders needed one, her advisers have said. Now, Sanders said in his speech, they\u2019ll travel the country together, aiming to create what she called \u201ca mass mobilization of working people.\u201d", "description": "His recent heart attack has given his effort a new message\u2014and has brought his supporters home.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2RWL0/facebook.jpg?1571585481", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
