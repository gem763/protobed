Matthew O. Williams, 37, received the award at the White House from President Trump, becoming the 18th recipient of the award for valor in Afghanistan and the 24th overall since the terrorist attacks of 2001 plunged America into 18 years of war.\n\n\u201cMatt\u2019s incredible heroism helped ensure that not a single American soldier died in the Battle of Shok Valley,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHis ground commander later wrote, \u2018I\u2019ve never seen a troop so poised, focused and capable during a fight,' and Matt is without question and without reservation one of the bravest soldiers and people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nTrump draped the medal around the Green Beret soldier\u2019s neck in the East Room of the White House, surrounded by colleagues who fought in the battle, family members and eight other recipients of the Medal of Honor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWilliams, meeting with reporters at the Pentagon on Tuesday, downplayed his actions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point in dwelling on how bad the situation really is,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou\u2019re better served to focus on what needs to happen and move toward that goal.\u201d\n\nThe battle erupted in Nuristan province\u2019s Shok Valley during a hunt for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an Afghan militia leader and warlord whose forces attacked U.S. troops and the Afghan government for years. His fighters unleashed a fearsome barrage on the soldiers, firing machine guns, rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons when they were about halfway up the mountain.\n\nWilliams, then a sergeant on his first of five deployments to Afghanistan, was down near the river as Hekmatyar\u2019s fighters ambushed the leading groups of U.S. soldiers.\n\nAD\n\nRetired Master Sgt. Scott Ford, who that day suffered a gunshot wound to an arm that nearly required amputation, said Tuesday that the Americans could tell something was going to happen but didn\u2019t realize immediately how serious it would be.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAlmost as soon as we got off the helicopter, women and children were running \u2014 not just leaving, but running \u2014 out of the village,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI immediately called the detachment [of Special Forces soldiers] and said, \u2018Heads on a swivel. It\u2019s going to go down.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Americans who had begun climbing the mountain first found themselves unable to move as enemy fighters sought to snuff them out. That\u2019s where Williams, Ford and Staff Sgt. Ronald J. Shurer II, a team medic, thrust themselves further into the fight under fire, as Trump recounted.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnce they reached their trapped comrades, Matt realized that several of his wounded comrades were too gravely wounded to be quickly evacuated,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe ran down the mountain to get support and then climbed back up with bullets spraying all around.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWilliams is credited with spending an hour climbing the mountain under fire to help remove wounded Americans, maneuvering through the ice-cold, waist-deep river to reach them. Some of the Afghan commandos \u2014 then a new force \u2014 assisted the Americans by returning fire.\n\nWilliams said that in some cases, he was able to maneuver up the mountain on foot. In others, he had to climb hand-over-hand while enemy forces fired.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like background white noise, really,\u201d Williams said of the chaos around him. \u201cMentally, I was more focused on what needed to happen as opposed to the sights and sounds.\u201d\n\nLt. Col. Kyle Walton, who was then a captain and detachment commander, was among those pinned down on the mountainside. Williams was always \u201clooking for work\u201d in the battle, maneuvering up and down the mountain to help others, Walton said.\n\nAD\n\nThe situation spiraled out of control badly enough that Walton was forced to call in airstrikes on advancing fighters that were \u201cdanger close,\u201d meaning the Americans were at risk of getting hit by their own bombs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes Matt Williams\u2019s action so special, is he was moving in and out of that scenario all day long,\u201d Walton said. \u201cAnd he continued to do it. He continued to come back and ask for more tasks. You know: \u2018What can I do? What do you need?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nWilliams\u2019s Medal of Honor advances understanding about the Battle of Shok Valley\u2019s significance in the 18-year war.\n\nInitially, 11 soldiers involved, including Williams, Walton and Ford, were awarded Silver Stars, two steps down from the Medal of Honor.\n\nStaff Sgt. Zachary Ryner, an Air Force joint tactical air controller who was assigned to the team to direct airstrikes, received the Air Force Cross, one step down from the Medal of Honor. He was credited with directing air support that included 4,570 cannon rounds, nine Hellfire missiles, 162 rockets and more than a dozen bombs.\n\nAD\n\nBut after the Pentagon launched a review in 2016 to see whether service members who earned a Silver Star and up had appropriately been recognized for their valor, the battle received more scrutiny. Last September, Trump notified Williams and Shurer that their Silver Stars would be upgraded to Medals of Honor.\n\nAD\n\nShurer and Williams said Tuesday at the Pentagon that they were notified about 10 days apart by the president. Shurer was recognized with the Medal of Honor a year ago, but Williams\u2019s ceremony was pushed back because he was about to deploy. His upgraded award was not disclosed until recently.\n\nShurer, who was hit in the helmet by an enemy round during the battle, described the fight as something of a blur \u2014 with the exception of a 2,000-pound bomb that landed nearby.\n\n\u201cThat one hit pretty close,\u201d he said with a small smile. \u201cThe skies were black, the sound was deafening, and when it exploded, it rained debris down on all of us.\u201d\n\nMatthews said that he recently returned from Africa with his team. He plans to remain in the Army and in Special Forces as long as he can. He never thought that his award might be upgraded, he said.\n\n\u201cAs far as I was concerned,\u201d he said, \u201cit was over and done with.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Master Sgt. Matthew O.
