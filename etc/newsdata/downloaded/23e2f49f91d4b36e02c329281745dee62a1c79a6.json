He could be intercepting but it's not the first thing you'd think of him doing during a game.\n\nMannequin linebacker Khalil Mack, pictured left, catches or runs with a ball as quarterback Derek Carr launches in to a low tackle\n\nNBC Sports Chicago reporter JJ Stankevitz said that it could have been Carr immediately tackling Mack after intercepting a Carr pass\n\nBut where the display comes to a logistical halt is with the second mannequin, dressed as Oakland Raider quarterback, Derek Carr.\n\nHis figurine is positioned driving down to catch Mack's leg, closing in on his ankle - a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nNBC Sports Chicago reporter JJ Stankevitz said that it could have been Carr immediately tackling Mack after intercepting a Carr pass.\n\nAnother theory is that Carr switched positions to play defensive back while Mack played receiver, which somehow makes even less logical sense.\n\nTwitter user Tony Nagatani said:\n\n'Brings a whole new meaning to the term fantasy football...'\n\nOther football fans racked their brains and left their own logical conclusions:\n\n\u2018Mack jumps and blocks a pass from Carr, tipping the ball up into the air behind Carr. Mack then runs by Carr as he turns and dives at him and catches the ball in stride. Boom,\u2019 said progodlegend.\n\nAlong with other theories from fans, an English user piped up to apologise for the shoddy forward planning that had gone into preparing the scene.\n\nThe display was set up in preparation of the game between the Oakland Raiders and Chicago Bears which will take place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London this Sunday\n\n'I apologise on behalf of the entire U.K. for this. I genuinely get annoyed that people are employed to do a job & they can't get the simple things right,' tweeted Deano.\n\nOthers used it as a moment to joke about American independence: 'Things like this are why we have been free since 1776 #Merica,' said nightmaresh\n\nThe bizarre mannequin presentation is in place for a Bears-Raiders game this Sunday that will take place at White Hart Lane, the stadium of premiership soccer team, Tottenham Hostpur.", "description": "The Nikestore on London's Oxford Street is in the line of ridicule from American football fans after setting up a display which has them stumped as to how it could possibly happen in a game scenario.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/10/19290344-0-image-a-20_1570180987645.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
