Did they, for example, understand that Stormtroopers are the bad guys? You know, the whole dark side thing?\n\nWas this really the action of a family who love the Star Wars nonology, or merely a ploy, more cynical than Disney\u2019s acquisition of Lucasfilm, to hitch a ride on the coat tails of the Millennium Falcon?\n\nMaybe Javanka were indeed cynically using their kid to project a softer, gentler, more cuddly image. However, it didn\u2019t really look like it.\n\nNote to super-powerful Hollywood movie stars with millions of online followers: As a general rule, it\u2019s wise to resist situations where it might, however unintentionally, look like you are trying to pick a fight with a 3 year old.\n\nThis isn\u2019t what you learned in training with Obi-Wan, but, maybe, on this occasion, Luke, don\u2019t use the Force.", "description": "Mark Hamill trolled a picture of Ivanka, Jared, and their 3-year-old son.
