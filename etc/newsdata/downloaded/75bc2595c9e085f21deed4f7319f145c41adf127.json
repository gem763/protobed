A metaphorical Fed put refers to the notion the central bank would take action aimed at shoring up asset prices in the event of a tumble.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s seeming commitment to propping up asset prices, however, has left the central bank unable to normalize policy without risking recession, Bannister said. Now there\u2019s a risk the Fed put could \u201cexpire worthless for investors, since the Fed has already made recession errors,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the Fed. Bannister said that since the crisis, periods of weakening global economic growth have elicited repeated stimulus in the form of rate cuts, quantitative easing or bond buying, and increased debt. While investors are conditioned to expect a third such rescue, policy makers are reluctant to go \u201call in,\u201d he said, due to the diminishing economic benefit versus cost.\n\n\u201cOur view is either to expect more flight to safety because a recession looms, or await more weakness that coerces policy makers to go further,\u201d he said. In either case, that should be a positive for defensive sectors, like utilities, real-estate investment trusts and consumer staples, despite the recent turn toward cyclical stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 index should soon signal whether the inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, as measured by the 10-year versus 3-month rate, foreshadows a mid-2020 recession, Bannister said. The yield on the 10-year note fell below the yield on the 3-month T-bill earlier this year. An inversion of that measure of the curve has proven a reliable indicator of recession, albeit with a lag, over the past several decades.\n\nStifel looked at the 50-day moving average of the 10-year/3-month spread. Going back to 1969, an inversion of the average preceded the start of a recession by 10.4 months with a median lead time of 10.7 months.\n\nThe 50-day average moved into inversion on June 20, which would imply a recession around May 2020, Bannister wrote, noting that the S&P 500 tends to lead recessions by around six to seven months. If that holds up, the risk to the S&P 500 is in the fourth quarter of this year, he said.\n\nBannister said low real interest rates support an S&P 500 trailing 12-month price -to-earnings ratio of 19 and fair value of 3,021 in 2019. But factoring in a 38% chance of recession, as calculated according to the New York Fed\u2019s yield-curve model) brings fair value down to 2,900, he said, around 3.5% below the index\u2019s Wednesday close.", "description": "The Federal Reserve might not be able to rescue the stock market even if it wants to, thanks to mistakes its already made, says the analyst who called last...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR640_powell_ZG_20190919115701.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
