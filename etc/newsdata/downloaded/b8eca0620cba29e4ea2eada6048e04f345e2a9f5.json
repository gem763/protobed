They cost $249 in the US, considerably more expensive than the AirPods 2, which will remain on sale.\n\nThe new earphones look largely similar to that cheaper, original version. But they have an ear tip that allows them to sit more snugly in the ear and keep out sound.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThat noise cancellation is the chief feature of the new earphones, though it can be turned off to allow people to hear sounds from around them. It does so in a way that lets people keep listening to music while also hearing the sounds that are going on around them, Apple said.\n\nIt is triggered using another update: a new \"force sensor\" on the stem allows people to switch it on and off as well as triggering other changes such as playing tracks or hanging up calls.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Without it on, they last the same amount of time, Apple said.\n\nThe earphones also include an \"Ear Tip Fit Test\", which plays sound through the earphones and uses that to ensure people are using the right size end on the earphones. Unlike the normal AirPods, users will be able to change the end of the Pro model to suit the size of their ear.\n\nAfter that, the AirPods use a similar feature called Adaptive EQ. Apple claims that will adjust the sound to the shape of the wearers' ear, improving both the audio quality and the noise cancellation.\n\n\u201cAirPods are the best-selling headphones in the world. The one-tap setup experience, incredible sound and iconic design have made them a beloved Apple product, and with AirPods Pro, we\u2019re taking the magic even further,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing head, in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe new in-ear AirPods Pro sound amazing with Adaptive EQ, fit comfortably with flexible ear tips and have innovative Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode. We think customers are going to love this new addition to the AirPods family.\u201d\n\nIn advance of the release of AirPods Pro, multiple rumours had suggested that the company would release them in a variety of colours, but Apple is still only selling them in white.", "description": "Apple has revealed its AirPods Pro, a new version of its smart earphones that include noise cancelling and a new design.
