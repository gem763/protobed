By Christmas, everybody\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency could be worth a whopping $20,000. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time. The currency nearly struck this mark by the end of 2017, and what\u2019s interesting is that by this time that year (September), bitcoin was trading for about $5,000 per unit. At press time, it\u2019s more than double this amount. Naturally, this raises many questions, the biggest one being, \u201cIf bitcoin can jump by $15,000 within three months, why can\u2019t it do so again?\u201d\n\nThis time around, if bitcoin were to reach $20,000, it would only need to jump by about $10,000. The space is much thinner, and if bitcoin is as resilient as it\u2019s proven to be since April, perhaps that $20,000 prediction isn\u2019t terribly out of the question.\n\nOne enthusiast who believes bitcoin is about to strike it big is Beth Moses, the astronaut that\u2019s training billionaire Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines to be the first entrepreneur in space. Branson is seeking to expand Virgin into Virgin Galactic, which will feature space travel and exploration in the coming years, and as she looks down on the earth from 56 miles away, she comments that blockchain has indeed created a world that\u2019s borderless. The technology behind bitcoin has many powers, one of which involves attaching businesses from all corners of the world.\n\nAs this continues, the demand for blockchain will grow. We\u2019ll see more businesses integrate its technology, which means bitcoin is likely to expand further. With that expansion will come price boosts.\n\nBut the reasons don\u2019t quite stop there. One big change we\u2019re witnessing in the crypto space as of late is the addition of crypto-related insurance to prevent people from falling victim to hacks and malicious online activity. To this day, cryptocurrencies are still heavily vulnerable to cybercriminals who seek to take coins or tokens that aren\u2019t theirs.\n\nKeeping Things Safe for People\n\nWe\u2019re now witnessing many more exchanges and crypto businesses alike offering insurance plans for their customers to ensure their money stays safe, even in the event of a hack. If they ever lose their funds, they\u2019ll be replaced immediately. This suggests that crypto is being treated more like traditional fiat, which is often protected through FICO insurance in standard banks. Thus, crypto is becoming a safer bet for many, which means more will arrive to invest. More investments mean more price rises.\n\nAnd to top it all off are new regulations designed for private enterprise blockchains seeking to earn their keep in the financial space. The more we can regulate, the more secure the space will become, which will in turn attract more people and lead to heavier price spikes as people invest.", "description": "At press time, many analysts are predicting that bitcoin could reach a whopping $20,000 per unit by the time Xmas rolls along.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2019/04/bitcoin-3137984_1920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
