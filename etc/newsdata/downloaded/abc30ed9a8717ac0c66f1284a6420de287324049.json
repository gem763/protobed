I've pretty much wanted one since they were released, but haven't had the courage to splurge on the $300 gaming console just yet. With Black Friday coming up, I expect them to sell out incredibly fast unfortunately, but right now there's a limited-time deal on the new and improved Switch that caught my eye. A discount like this is incredibly rare, so listen up gamers.\n\nRight now on Amazon if you clip the on-page coupon, you can save a cool $24.01 on this Switch, which will bring the price down to $274.99 at checkout. This discount is on the upgraded model, which comes with an increased battery life\u2014approximately 4.5 to 9 hours depending on the game you play. You can choose from either the grey or red and blue joy-cons, as the coupon can be applied to either.\n\nRetailers rarely, if ever, discount the Switch, so this coupon is literally a diamond in the rough. While we presume that Amazon and other stores may drop the price even lower on Black Friday, you'll have to be swift like a bunny if you want to score it on sale, and will have to risk it selling out, which is why this deal might be the safer bet if you'd like to ensure that you'll save on one.\n\nI for one, am seriously debating jumping on this sale and snagging a Switch for myself. That way I finally get to play Mario Kart, Overcooked, and the all-new Animal Crossing (being released next March) with my Switch-owning friends, whom I'm insanely jealous of.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
