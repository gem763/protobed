Pictured right is her mother Sarah, who had previously gone out with Farrell\n\nProsecutor Mike Jones QC said: 'While he was in police custody Farrell asked an officer for a pen and paper to write a confession. It is a chilling document and he uses the word murder.\n\n'In it he said he tied Sammy-Lee up and said he'd had enough and was going to kill her by stabbing her in the face and throat.\n\n'The confession was written willingly and carefully by he defendant and was recorded on officers' bodycams.'\n\nFarrell left Sammy-Lee in a pool of blood at his flat in Swansea on April 23 before calmly telling a neighbour: 'I killed her'.\n\nPolice and paramedics found 5ft 1inch Sammy-Lee still warm and in a 'foetal position' on a bed with stab wounds to her head, neck and chest.\n\nThe court heard she had knife wounds to her hands where she tried in vain to defend herself from 6ft Farrell, armed with the seven-inch kitchen knife.\n\nDrug user Farrell met Sammy-Lee when she was a little girl while he was in a relationship with her mother Sarah Lodwig.\n\nThe court heard how Sammy-Lee was 'brutally, mercilessly and repeatedly stabbed her to death' in his basement flat\n\nThey met again years later when she asked him for help because a man was following her.\n\nProsecutor Mr Jones told the jury: 'After his arrest Farrell told a police officer: 'F***. That girl didn't deserve to die like that, I've known her all my life.'\n\nThe court heard Farrell had been in a relationship with a woman called Lisa Ballard and blamed himself for her suicide in 2015 because of his lifestyle of drug taking and affairs.\n\nSammy-Lee was 22 when she was reunited with Farrell and the pair started a sexual relationship.\n\nBut the court heard Farrell was 'jealous' that her mother Sarah was seeing a man from Liverpool called Christopher Maher.\n\nFarrell is accused of unlawfully wounding Mr Maher, known by the nickname Scouse, with a wooden pole in a 'ferocious' street attack.\n\nProsecutor Mr Jones said: 'In the days leading up to the attacks he had expressed a desire to kill Mr Maher, Sammy-Lee and her mother.\n\n'He is a volatile and violent man.'\n\nThe jury heard Farrell used dressing gown belts to tie up Sammy-Lee at his basement flat in Swansea last April.\n\nIn a phone call to friend Tina Davies later that day he allegedly said: 'I've killed her. I have had enough. She would not shut up about Lisa so I sliced her up.'\n\nMr Jones told the court: 'He said it was a slow death and he made sure she did not scream during the attack.'\n\nFarrell was arrested at a nearby property and told officers: 'I'm going to be going down for 25 years for this.'\n\nIn his confession Farrell said he was in a 'hectic' relationship with Sammy-Lee's mother in 2001 and the pair had both used drugs including heroin.\n\nThe jury heard the relationship ended in 2010 when he was given a 13-year sentence for stabbing a man.\n\nFarrell, of Swansea, denies murder and unlawful wounding.
