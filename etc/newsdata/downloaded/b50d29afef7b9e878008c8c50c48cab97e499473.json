The mayor released a letter to Trump on Tuesday saying he looked forward to working together, but tensions between the White House and officials in heavily Democratic California were also on vivid display.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has sparred with the White House routinely, and his office released a statement Tuesday saying the state was ready to discuss serious proposals but Trump \u201ccould start by ending his plans to cut food stamps, gut health care for low-income people and scare immigrant families from accessing government services.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a statement that the city would welcome assistance from the federal government to build more housing \u201cbut simply cracking down on homelessness without providing the housing that people need is not a real solution.\u201d\n\nGarcetti, too, said he was ready to talk but wrote that \u201cthe federal government has woefully underfunded our housing safety net, contributing to homelessness\u201d and slashed funding for new housing.\n\n\u201cWe must put politics aside,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd at an event Monday in Beverly Hills, sponsored by the website Politico, Garcetti\u2019s chief of state and federal affairs, Breelyn Pete, said the city looked forward to explaining its homeless strategy to administration officials but added, \u201cThey\u2019re just not thoughtful, and quite frankly not smart enough, to know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nTrump would make an unlikely pairing with the Los Angeles mayor, who comes from a heavily Democratic state recognized as the center of the so-called Trump resistance. Trump lost California to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election by over 4 million votes.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere echoed Trump\u2019s earlier remarks linking homelessness with liberal policies, saying \u201cthe president has taken notice of the homelessness crisis, particularly in cities and states where the liberal policies of overregulation, excessive taxation, and poor public service delivery are combining to dramatically increase poverty and public health risks.\u201d\n\nLike many big cities, Los Angeles has struggled with homelessness for decades, and the population on the streets has grown despite a robust economy. Filthy, drug-infested encampments line downtown streets, and homeless people often sprawl on the lawn of City Hall, with tents nearby. The mayor says 36,000 people in the city are homeless on any given night.\n\nFigures released in June showed a 16% jump in Los Angeles\u2019 homeless population over the last year. The jump came after the mayor helped convince voters in 2016 to borrow $1.2 billion to construct housing for the homeless.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office said the federal group visited several homelessness projects, including a recently opened shelter.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sacramento County and the city of Sacramento joined the fight to overturn a federal court ruling barring municipalities from prosecuting homeless people for sleeping on the streets if there are no available shelter beds, The Sacramento Bee reported .\n\nThe Trump administration provided no specifics on what its national homeless policy would entail.\n\nTaylor Griffin, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said, \u201cHomelessness is a challenge to the conscience of our nation and a growing humanitarian crisis for communities across our country. The Trump Administration\u2019s heartless policies have only exacerbated the matter.\u201d", "description": "Members of the Trump administration visited Los Angeles on Tuesday to get a firsthand look at the city\u2019s sprawling homeless encampments and efforts to...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR051_homele_ZG_20190910210608.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
