Here is this week\u2019s question.\n\n\n\nQ. Can I live on a yacht and not pay property tax in the U.S.?\n\n\n\nA. Those always at sea may be able to avoid property taxes, according to J. Dirk Schwenk, a managing member at Baylaw, a law firm based in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nMore: Paul Allen\u2019s 414-Foot Yacht Octopus Lists for Over $300 Million\n\n\u201cIf you really are in motion all the time\u2014touching in ports, but not staying very long\u2014you're much less likely to be subject to tax as you go,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBut most people have to keep the yacht somewhere. To that end, a boat slip, or the area where the boat is kept, is taxed as property, even though it\u2019s just \u201can outline of a piece of water,\u201d Mr. Schwenk explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany locales tax slips as a separate real property if it is in a \u2018condo marina,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIn that case, the slip is sold to the user, as opposed to just leased.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe condo marina is much like other kinds of condominiums, albeit on water as opposed to on land. It will have an association, and slip owners have rights to the communal elements. There are also annual maintenance fees, Mr. Schwenk added.\n\nFrom Penta: Global UHNW Population Flatlines, Combined Wealth Declines for the First Time in Three Years\n\n\u201cThey're considered a real deeded way to be the owner of that little outlined piece of water,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe deeded slip is assessed by the local municipality in which it is located, as homes are. Then it is subject to the same property tax rates.\n\n\n\nIf a boat owner leases the slip, it is taxed as a portion of the value of the marina. Generally the marina pays this tax and the cost is part of the lease price.\n\n\n\nIn many U.S. states, yachts are also subject to a personal property tax, Mr. Schwenk pointed out.\n\nClick to Read Tax Experts Share Answers and Advice for Readers\u2019 Pressing Tax Questions\n\n\n\n\u201cMaryland, for example, does not have a personal property tax, but South Carolina and Virginia and a lot of our neighboring states do,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAlthough it\u2019s the state governments that allow or don\u2019t allow for the tax, the rates are set on the local level and levies are collected by the county or municipality in which the boat is kept.\n\n\n\nEmail your questions to editors@mansionglobal.com.
