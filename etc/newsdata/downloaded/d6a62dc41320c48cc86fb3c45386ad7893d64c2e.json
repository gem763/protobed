I doubt it, and so the current waters are in fact uncharted, because the ship of state has a sort of madman at its helm.\n\nThat he\u2019s fighting back by impugning his critics\u2019 motives, stonewalling investigators and carping about the media shouldn\u2019t disturb anyone, not if we\u2019re being grown-ups. Richard Nixon, confronted with his impeachment, thrashed and seethed. Clinton assembled a war room in an effort to outwit his adversaries. That\u2019s the nature of politics. That\u2019s the right of the accused.\n\nBut in the mere week since a formal impeachment inquiry was announced, Trump has already gone much farther than that and behaved in ways that explode precedent, offend decency and boggle the mind. We\u2019re fools if we don\u2019t brace for more and worse.\n\nFor grotesque example, he has suggested \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that government officials who tattled about his crooked conversation with the Ukrainian president are spies who deserve to be executed. Had any other president done that, many Americans would speak of nothing else for the next month.\n\nBut from Trump, such a horror wasn\u2019t even surprising, and it competed for attention with so many other outrages that it was dulled, the way so much of his unconscionable behavior is. When you churn out a disgrace a minute and no one expects anything nobler, you\u2019re inoculated by your own awfulness.\n\nHe has taken his vilification of the media to new depths, content on this front, as on others, to pump Americans full of a toxic cynicism so long as he profits from it. He and his handmaidens have disseminated distortion after distortion, lie upon lie, including the claim that deep-state officials tweaked the criteria for whistle-blowers just so that someone could ensnare him.\n\nThey have instructed Americans not to believe their own eyes, their own ears, their own intelligence. They mean to put truth itself up for grabs, no matter the fallout.", "description": "The impeachment inquiry is laying him bare.
