But this time, the clashes do not involve armed groups or occupation forces.\n\nInstead, Iraqi security forces have been shooting at young Iraqis demanding jobs, electricity and clean water - and an end to corruption.\n\nIt's still unclear why the government chose to exercise such a heavy-handed response to a few hundred unarmed demonstrators who first congregated last week on social media to hold a protest. But analysts say the violence has pushed Iraq toward a dangerous trajectory from which it might be difficult to pull back.\n\nAs the spontaneous protests - with no apparent political leadership emerging - continued to clash with security forces in Iraq cities and towns, the government appeared unapologetic and failed to offer solutions to entrenched problems, raising fears that yet another Arab nation will be mired in a long-term crisis without a path forward.\n\n\"The use of force coupled with cosmetic concessions will work to temporarily ease pressure but will not end the crisis,\" wrote Ayham Kamel, Middle East and North Africa head at Eurasia Group. \"This cycle of protests could be contained, but the political system will continue to lose legitimacy.\"\n\n'Thieves!'\n\nIn their demands for better services and an end to corruption, the protesters are no different from those who rioted in the southern city of Basra over chronic power cuts and water pollution last summer. Or in 2016, when angry demonstrators scaled the walls in Baghdad's highly secured Green Zone and stormed Iraq's parliament, shouting \"thieves!\"\n\nBut unlike in 2016 when the protests were led by populist Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, today's protests have not been co-opted by any political party. Most are young men in their 20s. They do not have a clear list of demands or a programme, nor do they have a spokesman to speak on their behalf. Some are teenagers or fresh university graduates unable to find jobs in a corruption-plagued country that sits on some of the world's biggest oil reserves.\n\nTheir movement - if it can be called that - has no clear contours, nor any quick solutions. The protesters say they are fed up with the entire post-2003 political class that profiteers on kickbacks, nepotism and corruption while ordinary Iraqis drink polluted water and endure massive unemployment.\n\nAnd most strikingly, the protests are predominantly Shia demonstrations against a Shia-led government.\n\nPrime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has promised to address protesters' demands. But the 77-year-old premier began his tenure last year facing a raft of accumulated challenges, including high unemployment, widespread corruption, dilapidated public services and poor security, and he has told protesters there is no \"magic solution for all that\".\n\nThe crisis erupted on October 1 after protesters who had organised on social media staged a demonstration calling for their rights. They were met with water cannon, tear gas and live rounds. The demonstrations were partially triggered by anger over the abrupt removal of a top Shia military who led battles against ISIL fighters and was largely seen as a non-corrupt, respected general. But the protesters carried a long list of grievances.\n\nCrackdown success?\n\nThe protests come at a critical moment for Iraq, which had been caught in the middle of escalating tensions between the United States and the regional Shia power Iran - both allies of the Baghdad government. Iraq's weak prime minister has struggled to remain neutral amid those tensions.\n\nAdding to the nervousness, mysterious air strikes blamed on Israel had for weeks targeted military bases and ammunitions depot in Iraq belonging to Iran-backed militias, which vowed revenge against Americans troops stationed here.\n\nThe protests, when they started, quickly spread from Baghdad to the Shia heartland in the south, including the flashpoint city of Basra. The government imposed a round-the-clock curfew and shut down the internet for days, in a desperate attempt to quell the protests.\n\nInterior Ministry spokesman Major-General Saad Maan said on Sunday that at least 104 people have been killed and more than 6,000 wounded in the unrest. He said eight members of the security forces were among those killed and 51 public buildings and eight political party headquarters had been torched by protesters.\n\nThe massive crackdown appears to have succeeded in whittling down the number of protesters for now, although sporadic clashes between demonstrators and security forces continue on a smaller scale, including an hours-long gun battle Monday night near the volatile Baghdad neighbourhood of Sadr City.\n\nBut among Iraqis and country observers, there is consensus that a dam has been broken and that with so many killed, the protest movement is likely to return, and become better organised next time - whenever that may be.\n\nIn a country awash with weapons, there are concerns the violence would lead some protesters to arm themselves, similar to what happened in Syria. There is also worry that some of the hard-line militias loyal to Iran could enter the fray and exploit the chaos.\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr, Iraq's influential cleric who has a popular Shia support base and the largest number of seats in parliament, has called on the government to resign because of the large number of people killed. He also suspended his bloc's participation in the government until it comes up with a reform program.\n\nIf al-Sadr joins the protest movement, it will give it much more momentum and potentially lead to even more violence.\n\nAli Al-Ghoraifi, an Iraqi blogger, said the government may have succeeded in putting a lid on the situation for the time being.\n\n\"But it will be like a coal ready to ignite at any time and place,\" he wrote in a post. \"And when it does, it will burn everyone.\"", "description": "In a country awash with weapons, there are concerns protesters will arm themselves, similar to what happened in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/26d2157515864563b9bd02924eeebd5e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
