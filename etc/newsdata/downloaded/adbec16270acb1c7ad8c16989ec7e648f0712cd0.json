It was the NFC wildcard game and the former Eagles running back ached after every hit.\n\nSmallwood mustered just 20 yards on eight carries. A swarm of defenders attacked him on each carry. The Eagles won the game, but the damage was done.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the sorest games I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been playing,\u201d the now Redskins running back said.\n\nAfter two straight games of finishing with less than 50 rushing yards, the Redskins are determined to get their running game back on track. But to fix it, they\u2019ll have to find success on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d against the Bears \u2014 an elite defense that gave up the fewest rushing yards last season.\n\nIn 2019, Chicago\u2019s run defense remains just as stout. Opponents have only managed three yards per carry and are averaging just over 68 rushing yards per game.\n\nLike the defense, the Redskins\u2019 running game hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations. Washington\u2019s main back, Derrius Guice, is out at least eight weeks with a torn meniscus and backup Adrian Peterson didn\u2019t have the same impact on Sunday as he did last year when the 34-year-old surprisingly stepped in to become the team\u2019s offensive MVP.\n\nAgainst the Cowboys, Peterson had only 25 yards on 10 carries.\n\n\u201cThe running game, we\u2019re not getting adequate enough movement, probably, with our interior people up to the next level from time to time,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cIt could be a point of attack, not getting movement from the point of attack. We\u2019re making the back just kinda stop his feet and cut it right up the gut real quick. There\u2019s a combination of things we can do better.\u201d\n\nGruden wants his teams to dominate the trenches, which hasn\u2019t happened in the first two weeks. The Redskins have missed blocks and haven\u2019t consistently created holes big enough for the running backs to work with. When they have, the explosiveness hasn\u2019t been there. Washington\u2019s longest run of the season resulted in only a 10-yard gain.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the case last year. With Peterson, the Redskins averaged 110.9 rushing yards per game \u2014 17th league-wide. Washington averaged 4.3 yards per carry and had 23 runs that resulted in a gain greater than 15 yards.\n\nThough the Redskins offense ranked as one of the league\u2019s worst, they formed an identity behind a hard-nosed rushing attack.\n\nMany expected the same approach in 2019, though Washington ranks just 28 in rush play percentage at 26.55%. A lot of that has been situational as the Redskins have fallen behind in games and abandoned the run completely.\n\nWashington\u2019s success in the passing game has been the biggest surprise of the season. Quarterback Case Keenum has found a chemistry with his young receivers and Washington has the fifth-most efficient passing attack, according to Football Outsiders\u2019 DVOA rankings.\n\nBut an effective running game can help open up the offense even further, Keenum said. The 31-year-old said it can take pressure off the Redskins\u2019 defense by extending drives, brings tighter coverage from opposing defenses and opens up play-action opportunities.\n\nThis season, Washington is averaging just 2.5 yards per attempt.\n\n\u201cWe need to do better,\u201d Keenum said.\n\nUnder Gruden, the Redskins incorporate a variety of different concepts in the run game rather than rely on just one scheme, like Mike Shanahan did with his zone-blocking scheme. Skeptics have criticized the coach for that approach, rather than trying to tailor to his players\u2019 strengths.\n\nThe topic re-emerged Sunday when Fox\u2019s Pam Oliver reported Gruden wasn\u2019t a \u201cfan of\u201d Peterson being a north-south runner. Former Bears wide receiver Brandon Marshall tweeted: \u201cHey Jay Gruden, AP\u2019s running style is better than your coaching style. #respectthegame\u201d\n\nGruden, though, dismissed that report, telling NBC Sports Washington \u201cyou want north-south runners.\u201d And on Friday, addressing a similar question about Washington\u2019s approach, offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell said if the Redskins could do the same four or five plays until somebody stopped them, they would.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Eagles also called a number of different runs, Smallwood said. The running back added it kept opposing defenses constantly off guard.\n\nSmallwood said if the Redskins start to have success with one type of run, it will unlock the others.\n\n\u201cI think it will eventually happen,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s early in the year. We\u2019ve got plenty of football left. We definitely can get it going.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
