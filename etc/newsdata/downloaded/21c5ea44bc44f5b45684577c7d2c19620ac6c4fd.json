set for victory but majority at risk", "language": "en", "text": "Warsaw (AFP) \u2013 Poland\u2019s governing right-wing party is poised to win a general election on Sunday, buoyed by generous social spending and fiery nationalist rhetoric, but its majority is at risk, giving opposition parties a narrow chance to snatch power.\n\nIn office since 2015 and led by ex-premier Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the Law and Justice (PiS) party has sought to mobilise mainly poorer rural voters by coupling family values with populist promises to extend benefits and hike the minimum wage.\n\nKaczynski, widely regarded as Poland\u2019s de facto leader, has led a highly polarising campaign, attacking sexual minorities and rejecting Western liberal values, all with the tacit blessing of Poland\u2019s influential Catholic church which holds sway over rural voters.\n\nThe Civic Coalition (KO), supported by outgoing EU Council President Donald Tusk \u2014 Kaczynski\u2019s arch-rival \u2014 has rallied mainly urban voters upset by the PiS\u2019s divisive politics, judicial reforms threatening the rule of law and high-profile graft scandals.\n\nRailing against the PiS\u2019s anti-LGBT views and its close ties to the church, but sharing its welfare goals, left-wing parties are poised to return to parliament after a four-year hiatus.\n\nSurveys also suggest two smaller groups could win seats, including the far-right.\n\n\u201cThe electorate is split down the middle, with around 45 percent each for the PiS and the centrist and leftist opposition,\u201d Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a Warsaw University political scientist, told AFP.\n\n\u201cTurnout will decide whether the PiS will govern alone, whether it will have to build a coalition, or even if it might lose its majority,\u201d she added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Promises kept\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe PiS has capitalised on a growing populist backlash against liberal urban elites, similar to trends in Western Europe and the US.\n\nIts generous social programmes have sought to appeal to Poles who felt they reaped little gain from Poland\u2019s explosive growth after it shed communism in 1989.\n\n\u201cOur great social program has led to the fact that the sphere of poverty, often extreme misery\u2026 has been abolished,\u201d Kaczynski, 70, told supporters at a Warsaw rally this week, calling it \u201cour moral achievement.\u201d\n\n\u201cPiS has done a great deal of good for families, pensioners, for children\u2026 they\u2019ve kept their promises,\u201d Malgorzata Kowalska, 66, a retired orphanage employee told AFP as she left a Warsaw church.\n\nBut a recent study shows that while extreme poverty dropped slightly in 2016-17 to just over four percent it rebounded to 5.4 percent in 2018 as inflation rose.\n\nJoanna, a 40-year-old stay-at-home mother raising three girls receives 1,500 zloty (350 euro, $380) per month in child benefits, She says the cash-in-hand won\u2019t sway her.\n\n\u201cRegardless of how much they\u2019ll give, I\u2019ll never vote for the PiS,\u201d said the formerly self-employed psychology graduate, slamming the party\u2019s \u201ccontempt for Poles who don\u2019t fit the stereotype of traditional Catholics.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Clean up politics\u2019 \u2013\n\nMalgorzata Kidawa-Blonska, the even-tempered 62-year-old deputy speaker of parliament chosen by the KO as its candidate for prime minister, has sought to provide a clear alternative to Kaczynski\u2019s polarising campaign.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s clean up politics, free Poles from hatred, hypocrisy and political toxins,\u201d she told supporters in Warsaw this week.\n\nThe KO opposition has vowed to reverse controversial PiS judicial reforms which the EU says threaten judicial independence and the rule of law but has otherwise offered voters little.\n\nAccording to Laurent Pech, a professor of European law at Middlesex University in the UK, threats to the rule of law in Poland are bound to \u201csignificantly worsen\u201d should PiS return to power.\n\nKaczynski\u2019s plans for a \u201cfuture \u2018reorganisation\u2019 of the courts are likely to mean a purge of the Polish judiciary under false pretences which will lead in turn to a renewed open conflict with the EU,\u201d he told AFP via email.\n\n\u2013 Most migrants \u2013\n\nOn the economic front, Poland has fared well with strong growth under the PiS, something critics attribute to favourable external factors.\n\nJoblessness hit a 30-year record low of 5.1 percent in September as employers struggled to find workers.\n\nDespite the PiS\u2019s strident anti-migrant rhetoric in the campaign ahead of its stunning 2015 victory, Poland became the world\u2019s top temporary labour destination in 2017, surpassing even the US, according to the OECD.\n\nSome 1.2 million temporary migrants arrived, mostly from Ukraine, to plug a massive labour gap created when Poles left for more lucrative work in the West after joining the EU in 2004.\n\nVoting runs from 0500 to 1900 GMT on Sunday, with exit polls expected after the polls close and preliminary results due on Monday.", "description":
