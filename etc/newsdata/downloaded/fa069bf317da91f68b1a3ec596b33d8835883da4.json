It was a tough day of test cricket. To get those three wickets late, we feel really in the game.\u201d\n\nBurns provided evidence that England may have found at least one opening batsman during this series but with those who followed him unable to show similar resilience, he was left hoping for another, Headingley-style, comeback.\n\n\u201cThe way that game went, I think anything is possible. We are not that far behind in this fixture. We are a couple of partnerships away from making them make a play again. It is about putting pressure back on them and playing well tomorrow,\u201d he said.", "description": "Australian paceman Josh Hazlewood ripped through England with three crucial late wickets in the final session to leave Joe Root's side trailing by 297 runs on 200-5 in their first innings after the third day of the fourth Ashes test on Friday.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426923879&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF85184", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
