Nick Street said. The driver didn\u2019t appear to be intoxicated, but authorities were still investigating, he said.\n\nThe crash happened near a highway rest stop about 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the entrance to the park known for its narrow red rock spires. There was some wind, but it was not strong enough to cause problems, Street said.\n\nPhotos show the top of a white bus smashed in, and one side peeling away as the vehicle came to rest mostly off the side of the road against a sign for restrooms.\n\nThe bus carried 31 people, including the driver, and 12 to 15 of them suffered critical injuries. An additional 10 had minor to serious injuries, the Utah Highway Patrol tweeted.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to investigate.\n\nInjured victims were sent to three hospitals. Intermountain Garfield Memorial Hospital said it received 17 patients, including three in critical condition and 11 in serious condition.\n\nPatients also were taken to Cedar City and St. George hospitals.\n\nChinese tourists are the fastest-growing group of tourists to visit Utah, and more than half travel on tour buses, said Vicki Varela, managing director of Utah Office of Tourism.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy tweeted that it was saddened to hear about the crash and that it was sending staff to help the victims.\n\nBryce Canyon, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City, draws more than 2 million visitors a year.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Brady McCombs contributed to the report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A bus carrying Chinese-speaking tourists crashed on the way to a national park in Utah, killing four people and critically injuring as many as 15 others, authorities said Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Lindsay Whitehurst", "Morgan Smith"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/tour_bus_crash_bryce_canyon_10436_c0-185-3000-1934_s1770x1032.jpg?97af2a330f76ac75dfa17477f7adef3dba922777", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
