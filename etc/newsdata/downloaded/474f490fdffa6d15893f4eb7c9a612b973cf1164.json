As the storm went on, she saw connections bloom across social media to rescue and reunite families.\n\n\"There's no number that everyone knows for disasters of this magnitude and there was no social media plan whatsoever,\" deGregory said. \"So everything that happened purely happened because someone would connect it to someone who was connected to someone who's connected to someone else.\"\n\nbahamas hurricane dorian More\n\nJoe Skipper/Reuters\n\nRead more: A woman who survived Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas told us people weren't prepared for 20-foot storm surges, and now the islands are 'absolutely destroyed'\n\n\"When citizens have to deputize themselves to rescue their fellow countrymen and women because those who were paid to serve and protect and lead are failing to do so, we have a serious problem,\" deGregory said.\n\nFreelance journalist Kimberly Mullings left the first days of her second year at North Carolina Central University to be with her mother during the storm in her native Bahamas. She told Insider that \"the government failed\" Bahamians, who saved countless lives because of their quick organizing.\n\n\"Our government has failed us,\" Mullings said. \"If we hadn't stepped up, we don't know where we would be.\"\n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1168918865566474242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nRand Memorial Hospital\n\nFreeport, Grand Bahama#HurricaneDorian242pic.twitter.com/zhAjs3L7r1", "description": "Hurricane Dorian made landfall over the Bahamas on September 1 as a Category 5 storm and proceeded to devastate some areas of the Bahamas.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qhUGMeTLQ6TIGQ9DXmsSoQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/99a1505afba2501cc99473e405495573", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
