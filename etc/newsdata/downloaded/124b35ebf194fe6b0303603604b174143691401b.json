It\u2019s possible the livers could go for hours more. The team is also testing the protocol in other organs, such as hearts and kidneys.\n\nYet other researchers are seeking to extend the viability of organs even longer\u2014to the scale of months and perhaps even years. In 2002, Greg Fahy, a cryobiologist now at 21st Century Medicine, famously vitrified a rabbit kidney. Vitrification is a glasslike state, in which organs are rapidly cooled along with cryoprotectants that prevent the formation of ice crystals. At 200 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, an organ might be stored pretty much indefinitely. But while vitrification works for cells\u2014it\u2019s now become common for women storing their eggs\u2014it\u2019s much more difficult to use on organs, which are a mix of different types of cells, each with finicky preferences. When Fahy\u2019s vitrified rabbit kidney was warmed and transplanted, the rabbit lived for 48 days before it was killed for examination\u2014but the organ was also clearly not working as well as a healthy one.\n\nFahy is working with John Bischof, a mechanical engineer at the University of Minnesota, who is trying to rewarm vitrified organs by embedding them with nanoparticles. When vitrified organs warm normally, they can crack\u2014\u201clike taking an ice cube and dropping it into water,\u201d Bischof says. So instead, he rapidly warms the entire piece of tissue by using a magnetic field to \u201cvibrate\u201d nanoparticles embedded inside. Bischof has used nanowarming on vitrified rabbit livers, rat livers, and hearts from both animals, and he hopes to test how the organs warmed this way fare in animals soon.\n\n[ Read: The twice-transplanted kidney ]\n\nThe ability to preserve organs could cut down on the number of organs recovered for transplant that go to waste, says Jedediah Lewis, CEO of the nonprofit Organ Preservation Alliance. He points out that U.S. patients who die waiting for a liver transplant turn down, on average, six livers offered to them. Ten percent of recovered livers never find a donor in the U.S. at all. Sometimes, no donors are a good match based on age and immune-system compatibility in the limited geographical area that the organ has time to cross. Transplant centers also refuse organs they think are risky, because they do not want their failure rates to go up. Shimul Shah, a liver-transplant surgeon at the University of Cincinnati, describes the stakes to using a risky liver this way: \u201cIf we\u2019re wrong, the patient dies. That\u2019s why people are conservative and only use the perfect livers.\u201d\n\nIf organs can be better preserved, they can travel farther to a better-matched recipient. These techniques might also allow surgeons and patients to take a chance on an organ they might have passed up. In recent years, an increasing number of organs have come from patients who died after their hearts stopped\u2014rather than after being declared brain-dead. Cardiac death can cause more damage to the organs, which are no longer getting oxygen and might not last as long on ice.", "description": "A new technique can preserve the organ outside the human body for at least 27 hours.", "authors": ["Sarah Zhang"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Large/facebook.jpg?1568037282", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
