New Financial has not updated its March estimate of 5,000 job moves and about 800 billion pounds ($1 trillion) in assets shifting base.\n\n\"Over time, we expect the headline numbers of firms, staff, and business to increase significantly,\" the think tank said.", "description": "Brexit finance relocations limit need for future trade link: think tank", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F0HB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
