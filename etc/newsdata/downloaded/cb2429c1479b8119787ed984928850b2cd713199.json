He featured a clip of Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street saying: \"I'm not... leaving - the show goes on!\"\n\nFans could barely contain their excitement.\n\nThe film rights to the superhero are owned by Sony, but he was able to appear in movies like Avengers: Endgame due to a deal between Sony and Marvel Studios, which is owned by Disney.\n\nVariety added that the new film is expected to hit cinemas on 16 July 2021.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
