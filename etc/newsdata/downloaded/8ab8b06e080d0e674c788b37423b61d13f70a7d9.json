And boy, are they insane.\n\nCostco (COST) opened its first-ever store in China\u2019s Shanghai on August 27. It proceeded to watch shoppers overrun the expansive aisles and take to Twitter to complain of the over-crowding and poor parking conditions. The crowds got so big that the store was forced to cut the opening day short over safety worries, according to news reports.\n\nCostco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti told investors at a Goldman Sachs conference Wednesday that 139,000 people signed up for memberships at the store on day one. The figure had not been previously disclosed.\n\nFor Costco, the hearty day one response should temper concerns on Wall Street that its bulk-selling model wouldn\u2019t work in the hyper local Chinese food market.\n\nIt\u2019s very likely that Costco becomes a key retailer in China as the growing middle class \u2014 which is triggering investments in larger living spaces and creating more income \u2014 drives demand to buy in bulk (which is still a rather unique model in the country).\n\nGalanti confirmed on a May conference call with analysts it plans to open its second warehouse in China within the next two years despite trade war concerns. He said at the Goldman conference the company will take a measured approach to China expansion despite the successful first opening.\n\nCostco isn\u2019t alone in selling bulk goods to the Chinese masses. Walmart\u2019s (WMT) Sam\u2019s Club has been in China for about 20 years. The warehouse chain has roughly 24 stores open in the country. It said earlier this year it plans to add 16 more locations in mainland China by 2020.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
