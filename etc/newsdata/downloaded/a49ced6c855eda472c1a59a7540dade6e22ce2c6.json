It also blocked a brief statement declaring that the EU would return to the topic after a leaders' summit in Brussels this week, according to diplomats.\n\nWhile Paris had some allies in rejecting talks with Albania, Macron's government stood alone in blocking the start of negotiations with North Macedonia, diplomats said. France's stance sparked fury among some other EU members and the issue will be debated at this week's summit, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel among those pushing France to soften its position.\n\nFrance's critics argued that it risks setting back efforts to stabilize the Balkans and bolstering rival powers in the volatile region on the EU's southern flank. They also argued that North Macedonia in particular had fulfilled tough conditions set by the EU, including settling a long-running dispute with Greece, and that a failure to open talks with Skopje would badly damage the bloc's credibility.\n\nSome EU diplomats suspect Macron of using the issue of EU enlargement as leverage to win concessions in other policy areas. But, at a joint news conference with Merkel in the French city of Toulouse, Macron insisted the accession process needed fundamental change.\n\nMacron sought to make a comparison with a shared house to illustrate his point that the EU needs to reform.\n\nHe made clear he could not accept opening talks with Albania at this stage but seemed to leave some room for maneuver on North Macedonia.\n\n\"I think we have to reform this procedure, which is at the moment irreversible, not progressive and has not adapted,\" he said. \"We do things that are bizarre \u2026 We give visa liberalisation, the right to move freely between our countries, before we even open the negotiations.\"\n\nMacron cited the example of Albania, whose citizens can travel to France without a visa, although it has not begun EU membership talks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, as a type of relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nHe asked how he could tell the French people that \"everything\u2019s going so well that we\u2019re going to open negotiations\u201d with Albania, when \"thousands and thousands and thousands\" of Albanians ask for asylum in France.\n\nMacron insisted he wanted to send a positive signal to leaders of North Macedonia and Albania for their efforts to improve the rule of law and democratic standards in recent years. He said he also agreed with Merkel that the Balkans were of great strategic importance to the EU. But he said things had to be done \"in the right order.\"\n\n\"In a spirit of seriousness and given the discussions we've had, this leads me to think that it may be us who has to ask for more time to put things in the right order,\" he said.\n\nMacron made a comparison with a shared house to illustrate his point that the EU needs to reform before it can contemplate taking in new members.\n\n\"Europe is a big and beautiful house, which we live in together,\" the French leader said.\n\n\"A few years ago, a member of the family decided to leave and it's a lot of trouble for them to leave the house. And we sometimes have trouble renovating the house, to repair the lights, the electricity. And by the way, a lot of members, when you ask them, 'Are you ready to invest to repair the lights, to re-do the door?' they say, 'No, I'm not ready to invest in this house. Not more than 1 percent.' But the same people sometimes say, 'Even though we don't know how people can leave, or how to renovate, we want to invite in new friends.'\"\n\nAlthough Macron and Merkel sought to play down their differences on enlargement, that remark could be interpreted as a dig at Berlin \u2014 which has said it wants contributions to the next long-term EU budget to be no more than 1 percent of Gross National Income.\n\nMerkel, for her part, said she supported the French call to reform the accession process but noted there was an open question over what conditions North Macedonia and Albania should have to fulfill before they could start talks.\n\n\"There are maybe a couple of different nuances on this issue but we'll talk between now and tomorrow about how far we can get toward a common position,\" Merkel said.\n\n\"Everything in the European Council must be decided unanimously so we are obliged \u2014 and we've managed it pretty often \u2014 to find common positions, and not just between France and Germany. \"\n\nAndrew Gray reported from Brussels.", "description": "French leader rules out membership talks with Albania but seems to leave chink of light for North Macedonia.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Andrew Gray", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176192751-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
