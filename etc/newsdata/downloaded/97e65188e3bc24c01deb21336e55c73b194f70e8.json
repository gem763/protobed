That\u2019s 80,000 more cases than the previous year.\n\nBut the surge of border crossers, many of lodging complex though likely bogus claims of asylum, has left the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which hears immigration cases, struggling to keep up.\n\nEOIR ended the fiscal year with 987,000 cases pending, up from 789,000 cases a year earlier.\n\nThe immigration courts are separate from the criminal justice system. They hear deportation cases and other immigration benefit matters, such as ruling on claims of asylum.\n\nEOIR, which is part of the Justice Department, had hoped to make a dent in the numbers this year.\n\nIt hired hundreds of new immigration judges and announced a new performance system that pushed immigration judges to meet a benchmark for cases completed.\n\nThough the policy drew fierce pushback from immigrant-rights activists, it appears to have worked, said James McHenry, EOIR\u2019s director.\n\nBut the surge of illegal immigrant families at the border, who thanks to lax U.S. policies were mostly released into the interior with future court dates, worked to send the caseload higher.\n\n\u201cOur immigration courts are doing everything in their power to efficiently adjudicate immigration cases while respecting due process rights, but efficient adjudication alone cannot resolve the crisis at the border,\u201d Mr. McHenry said. \u201cWhile EOIR is doing an unprecedented job adjudicating cases fairly and expeditiously, the nearly one million case backlog will continue to grow unless Congress acts to address the crisis at the border.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
