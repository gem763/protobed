The people you leave behind are going to have to figure out what to do with your pets, your stuff, and even your Gmail account.\n\nMaking a plan for your email (and your Google Drive, Google Pay, and Photos accounts) is super simple to do and can be part of that plan you handle today, both to help your friends or family out when that time comes and help prevent your accounts from winding up being accessed in a way you don\u2019t want.\n\nThe Next Web detailed the process this weekend, reminding me both that it\u2019s an option as well as the fact that it\u2019s an option I should probably take a look at again (and maybe remove an ex from).\n\nFirst, log into your Google account. If you\u2019re using Chrome, you\u2019re probably already logged in.\n\nGo to your Google Account page. From a basic Google search page, you can get there by clicking on your face in the top right corner.\n\nOnce you\u2019re there, search for \u201cInactive Account Manager\u201d to pull up the settings for your account should you go inactive.\n\nFrom there, you can decide to have your account self-destruct if it goes inactive for a certain period of time. Three months is the minimum, but the options scale up from there to six months, twelve months, and eighteen months. Before that self-destruct happens they\u2019ll be some SMS notifications letting you know in case, you know, you\u2019re not dead.\n\nScreenshot: Google\n\nOn the same page, you can also add up to 10 people you\u2019d like to be notified if your account goes inactive. If you\u2019re like me and have the fear of dying in the bathtub and no one noticing, this can give your pals a heads-up there might be a reason you\u2019re not returning their calls. You can also decide to grant them access to your accounts in some form if you\u2019d like.\n\nPlanning for your own death is obviously not something we\u2019re all looking forward to. Doing something small like setting up a plan for your email and photos; however, can give you a little peace of mind that nothing odd is going to happen to them when that day comes.", "description": "No matter how old or healthy you are, having a death plan, even a rough one, is a pretty solid idea.
