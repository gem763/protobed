'It's easy to say it's a problem for Bulgaria but Raheem Sterling was forced to come out and talk about it when he was abused at Chelsea, it shows we still have it here.\n\n'People in positions of power don't seem to realise that when the make insulting comments on race and colour they are giving ordinary people licence to do exactly the same.\n\n'If you talk about certain religions or foreign people in a certain way, what is going to stop people saying that in the street. That kind of language doesn't help heal the divisions in society.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has been criticised for using terms like 'water melon smiles' and 'piccaninnies' while US President Donald Trump told American-born political rivals to 'go back' to their countries, a statement praised by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.\n\n'Leaders of every country have to be careful what they say because the impact they are having is going to be extremely harmful to certain people. This is not just a football issue, it's a society issue and politicians have a role to play like footballers or any role model have,' added Boyce.\n\n'Anyone in power has a responsibility to the public to send out the right messages, not just what the messages they want to do for their own benefit. Send out the right message to educate the new generation and work from there. Surely our Prime Minister is intelligent enough to see what that kind of language can lead to.' Boyce, now 40 and setting up his own football academy after retiring as a player, has grim personal experience of racism.\n\nThe former defender has called on political figures such as Boris Johnson (left) and Donald Trump (right) to stop using such inflammatory language\n\n'Six or seven years ago, my son had to move schools because he was getting bullied and abused because of his colour. He would come home and cover his eyes and his hair because he was different,' he reveals.\n\n'I was fortunate that I was financially able to move him to another school but a lot of families have no choice but to stay. It just keeps getting swept under the carpet.\n\n'As a young player, hearing it became part of your normal day. Team-mates would tell me to just try and block it out of my head.\n\n'The situation is better for players now but you still hear racism in stadiums. I go with my family and someone might be racially abusing a player. They think it's Ok to be offensive to a black player on the opposition even though wouldn't be offensive to me. No, it is offensive. There is no justification.\n\nThe issue of racism in football was highlighted on Monday when England players were abused\n\nTyrone Mings and Raheem Sterling in particuliar were racially abused by Bulgaria fans\n\n'I have heard racist language when I have been sat in the stand and the fans doing it say 'we didn't mean you'.\n\nBoyce was on the receiving end of monkey chants when he played for Wigan in a European game in Wigan and is distraught that several years later, the issue is still raising its ugly head.\n\nHis sister Stephanie became the first black leader of the Law Society earlier this year but Boyce insists we shouldn't pretend the problem has gone away in Britain.\n\n'I've been told to go back to my own country - and I was born in Aylesbury,' he says.\n\nThe fallout from the game meant that the President of the Bulgarian Football Union resigned\n\n'We talk about racism when it happens at a football game. But what about the person who goes to work and gets racial abuse, or walks down the street or stands outside a stadium and gets abuse. We don't highlight it.\n\n'I've had family in the crowd and they get racial abuse. So what do they do? They can't do nothing. They complain to the steward, sometimes the steward is the same colour, and he gets racial abuse. It is hard and it's good that at least people are challenging it now even if not enough is being done.\n\n'Campaigns like Kick It Out have done their job but it needs a higher authority to take it to the next step. That is what we are screaming out for.'", "description": "Emmerson Boyce, 40, is dismayed by the growing number of racist incidents in the game, highlighted by last week's problems when England players were taunted in Bulgaria, and has spoken out.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/23/19938644-0-image-a-16_1571522627360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
