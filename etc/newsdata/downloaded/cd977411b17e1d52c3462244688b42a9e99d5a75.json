McKevitt was sentenced to 20 years.\n\nDiplomatic immunity is never surrendered lightly but in this case I saw a clear public good in my doing so as, had I declined, the prosecution had decided that the case could not continue.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand what underpins diplomatic immunity. Its purpose is not to frustrate justice or allow diplomats to flout the law by for instance running up a string of parking or speeding offences. It is there to allow diplomats to carry out their mission independently of any local pressures while being themselves under protection from attack or harassment. It is there not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the function of diplomatic missions.\n\nEven in the U.S., the number who believe immunity should be waived is 63 percent.\n\nIn the case currently under the spotlight, the person with diplomatic status is Anne Sacoolas, the wife of U.S. intelligence official Jonathan Sacoolas, who is the material witness to an accident in which young motorcyclist Harry Dunn died after a collision with her car.\n\nIt is disturbing and a clear breach of the spirit of diplomatic immunity that she fled the country only a day after assuring the Northamptonshire police she had no intention of doing so. This is a case where two friendly countries should be expected to find an accommodation, perhaps by conceding the temporary lifting of immunity while she gave a full account of the tragedy to the police.\n\nA death no less tragic was that in 1984 of WPC Yvonne Fletcher on duty outside the Libyan People\u2019s Bureau, effectively its embassy, when one of its staff opened fire from the embassy windows on a peaceful demonstration against the Gaddafi regime and killed her rather than a demonstrator.\n\nThe U.K. government immediately severed diplomatic relations with the Libyan regime, closing their embassy, but was forced to allow the unidentified murderer and his colleagues to leave the country. In the case of a rogue regime like Libya, the idea of their waiving diplomatic immunity and surrendering the gunman was unthinkable. Hence the decision to expel the whole embassy.\n\nA more recent case involved Saudi billionaire Walid Al-Juffali who, having divorced his wife, declined to make adequate provision for her in the divorce proceedings, claiming that he had diplomatic immunity. He had acquired diplomatic status as the ambassador to the International Maritime Organization in London having been so appointed by the government of Saint Lucia. He had never attended a meeting of the organization and had never visited Saint Lucia. The Court of Appeal was not impressed and regarded his claim of diplomatic status as bogus as his permanent residence was the U.K. His ex-wife received a settlement of $75 million.\n\nUnder the provision of international law, the U.S. can remain equally intransigent and insensitive to the burning sense of injustice that not only Harry Dunn\u2019s family and friends feel but also 84 percent of the U.K. public polled two days ago.\n\nEven in the U.S., the number who believe immunity should be waived is 63 percent. While the PM will doubtless continue to press Donald Trump to waive immunity, the chances of a president whose slogan is \u201cAmerica First\u201d doing so seem fanciful.\n\nTrump\u2019s first reaction was to exculpate Sacoolas, saying that any U.S. citizen can get confused and drive on the wrong side of the road when abroad. It\u2019s hard to believe he would take such an understanding position if a British diplomat in Washington had killed an American citizen in similar circumstances.\n\nSo, is there any sanction within international law that the U.K. can impose if the U.S. remains deaf to appeals from the Dunn family and the government? Perhaps, though to imagine Boris Johnson doing so when he has invested so much in close trade and political relationships with the U.S. in the future may be stretching it. The flight of Sacoolas could not have occurred without the permission \u2014 perhaps even at the suggestion \u2014 of U.S. Ambassador Woody Johnson, a close friend and supporter of Trump.\n\nIn these circumstances, the U.K. government could more formally do what Trump did less formally and torpedo the diplomatic mission of the ambassador by explicitly stating that he was no longer welcome. The diplomatic term is to declare someone persona non grata. Some of us have sailed pretty close to that wind \u2014 in my case in Serbia being accused of interfering in the country\u2019s domestic affairs in the run-up to war in Kosovo.\n\nAn honorable ambassador should do the honorable thing and go.\n\nTrump had no compunction, after the deplorable leak of Kim Darroch\u2019s telegrams describing the Trump administration as dysfunctional, in stating that the U.S. administration would no longer work with Darroch, thus rendering his mission nugatory. Darroch was blameless: His comments accurate and measured.\n\nIf the U.S. ambassador in the U.K. played any part in the disreputable flight of Sacoolas it would be entirely reasonable and proportionate to announce that the U.K. government would no longer work with the ambassador and leave him to draw the necessary conclusions. If the response is that the ambassador had no knowledge of Sacoolas\u2019 flight, then the question has to be, why not? He is the ambassador and would immediately have been notified of the incident involving a U.S. official\u2019s wife and the death of a U.K. citizen.\n\nIf he claims that the decision was taken over his head in Washington or in the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, then he has the responsibility for the actions of his diplomatic staff without the power to order his staff to cooperate with the local authorities.\n\nHe would in any event be failing to do his job in not explaining the damage that would be done to bilateral relations by such a cavalier insensitivity to the injustice felt by the family. Either way, it cannot be business as usual with the U.S. Embassy if they decline to assist the enquiry by allowing Sacoolas to be interviewed.\n\nAn honorable ambassador should do the honorable thing and go.\n\nSir Ivor Roberts is a former British ambassador and former president of Trinity College, Oxford.
