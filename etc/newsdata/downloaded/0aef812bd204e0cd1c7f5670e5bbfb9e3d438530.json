O.J. Simpson.\u201d\n\nHe had been scheduled to go to trial on the original charges Thursday, but the additional charges mean the trial will be delayed. A new date has not yet been set.\n\nGooding\u2019s lawyer, Mark Heller, said video from the bar where his client was accused of groping the woman \u201cclearly shows that there was no groping or crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly the prosecutor was not prepared to proceed to trial in this case,\u201d he said.\n\nHeller said he did not have any details about the new charges.\n\n\u201cI doubt it\u2019s anything that\u2019s credible,\u201d he said.\n\nGooding, 51, was charged with one misdemeanor count of forcible touching in June after an unidentified woman said the actor had touched her breasts in a bar.
