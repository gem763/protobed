They will then refer the matter to both houses of Parliament \u2013 the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces - for processing because the Houses appoint the secretary.\n\nDA chief whip John Steenhuisen asked when Mgidlana's contract expired.\n\nAccording to Modise, it ends at the end of November.\n\nSteenhuisen then asked whether his contract should just not be renewed but Modise said no because Parliament spent money on a disciplinary process and somebody with findings like that against him isn't \"somebody you allow to stay\".\n\n\"Right answer!\" Steenhuisen responded.\n\nMgidlana was placed on voluntary special leave on June 9, 2017, after the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) levelled allegations against him.\n\nNehawu accused Mgidlana of receiving an ex gratia payment of R71 000, irregularly awarding himself a study bursary over junior staff, and following improper procurement processes.\n\nHe faced charges relating to the breach of legislation on the financial management of Parliament and provincial legislatures, the breach of parliamentary policies as well as the breach of the National Road Traffic Act.\n\nIn April last year, he launched an unsuccessful court bid to interdict the disciplinary process.\n\nMgidlana previously denied the allegations against him, saying no evidence had been produced to back them up.\n\n\"Central to Nehawu's malicious allegations is a claim that the current financial difficulty is caused by financial mismanagement and/ or corruption.\n\n\"This is a deliberately misleading, baseless and unnecessary propagation of untruths,\" he said at the time.", "description": "Parliament's presiding officers have accepted a disciplinary committee recommendation that suspended secretary of Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana be summarily dismissed after he was found guilty of serious misconduct in relation to four of the 13 charges against him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4813/5cec00c7aecc47b7a93a95bdd7dc0621.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
