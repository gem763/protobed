But Gabbard, whose worldview on key issues diverges from other Democrats, has sharply criticized other candidates in each of her debates so far, including telling Kamala Harris that people \u201csuffered under her reign\u201d when Harris was California\u2019s attorney general.\n\nAnd with Gabbard and others looking to break open a campaign that has been largely static behind the front-runners, Democrats in other campaigns are buzzing over who the iconoclastic Hawaii congresswoman could target next. Gabbard\u2019s non-interventionist foreign policy platform could mean trouble for Joe Biden. She recently questioned Elizabeth Warren\u2019s national security experience.\n\nShe could even decide to put the whole Democratic presidential field on blast for politicizing the impeachment process, after tweeting recently that candidates fundraising off the inquiry were \u201cundermining credibility\u201d of House Democrats\u2019 probes of President Donald Trump.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
