Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\n\n\n\n2. In a large ovenproof skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the shallot, chopped sage, and thyme and cook, stirring often, until the shallot is fragrant and the butter is lightly browned, three to five minutes. Add the flour and cook until golden, one to two minutes. Gradually whisk in the broth and milk, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil.\n\n\n\n3. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, whisking occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in the carrots and broccoli and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes more.\n\n\n\n4. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the chicken and parsley. Taste and add more salt and pepper as needed.\n\n\n\n5. Unfold the puff pastry and gently roll it out on a lightly floured work surface until it is slightly larger than your skillet. Place the pastry over the skillet, tucking the sides under the top to fit, and brush with egg. Make two or three slits in the top of the pastry with a sharp knife.\n\n\n\n6. Bake until the pastry is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes and sprinkle with sage leaves before serving.\n\n\n\n7.
