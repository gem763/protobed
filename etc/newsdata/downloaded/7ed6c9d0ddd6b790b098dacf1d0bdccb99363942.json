But for his illness, he would have been charged.\",\n\nLucas's lawyer declined to comment.\n\nThe defendants are charged with conspiring with Lucas to commit fraud by false representation as well as a separate charge of fraud by false representation. They deny wrongdoing.\n\nThe trial is expected to last five months. The defence will later present its case.\n\nBarclays paid Qatar 322 million pounds ($393m) in fees that were not disclosed in public documents, such as the prospectuses and subscription agreements that outlined payments and commissions paid to investors as incentives for their support.\n\nThe prosecution alleges that the defendants breached well-established banking practice, under which all investors should be paid equally, and disguised these fees as \"bogus\" advisory services agreements.\n\nBrown said Barclays lawyers wanted evidence of services to justify the fees the bank was paying Qatar - and he alleged the defendants and Lucas had made \"after-the-event\" attempts to demonstrate some services had been provided.\n\nBut he added: \"These did not come close to justifying the huge amounts paid over to the Qataris and, you may well conclude, were nothing more than a smokescreen to seek to legitimise what had gone before.\"\n\nQatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, invested about four billion pounds ($4.9bn) in Barclays over 2008.\n\nBrown told the jury that the Qataris demanded more than double what the bank had agreed to pay other investors and the defendants, knowing Barclays needed to strengthen its balance sheet in volatile markets, wrestled with how to pay them.\n\nJenkins, the former chairman of the bank's Middle East investment banking arm, Kalaris, who led the bank's wealth division and Boath, a former European head of corporate finance, are charged with fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over the first fundraising in June 2008.\n\nJenkins also faces both charges over the second fundraising that October.", "description": "Fraud trial concerns undisclosed payments made to Qatar as Barclays struggled during 2008 financial crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/ee6c64d5b65441d19406830ed5dd04a8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
