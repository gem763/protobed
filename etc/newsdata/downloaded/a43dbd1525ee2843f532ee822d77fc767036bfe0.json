He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why. Reuters 2/19 The Whistleblower Believed to be a CIA agent who spent time at the White House, his complaint was largely based on second and third-hand accounts from worried White House staff.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved.

AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year.

Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

Getty\n\nThe testimony marks just the latest US official to break against State Department efforts to squash attempts by House Democrats to compel disclosures through subpoenas. The subpoena was issued shortly after the State Department signalled it would not voluntarily allow its officials to testify.\n\nAnd, Mr Taylor's comments show why: he has provided some of the most damning information to the president since the revelation of the whistle blower complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry itself, according to Democrats.\n\n\"It was just the most damning testimony I've heard,\" said representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, during an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nThe testimony appeared to confirm claims that Mr Trump had used US money as leverage in order to force the investigation into Mr Biden, who is the son of former vice president Joe Biden, a key figure who pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor. Mr Trump has claimed, contrary to evidence, that Mr Biden had acted on behalf of his son's interest to get the prosecutor fired, even though the effort was indicative of the Obama administration's foreign policy and had international consensus.\n\nMr Trump has denied any clear quid pro quo had occurred during a 25 July phone call with Mr Zelensky, even though a rough transcript released by the White House appears to show Mr Trump pushing for the investigation as a favour to him.\n\n\"He drew a very specific direct line from president Trump to the withholding of foreign aid and the refusal of a meeting,\" Ms Wasserman Schultz said, describing a meeting between the two presidents that was a part of the discussions. It \"directly related to both insisting on Zelensky publicly say that he'll have an investigation, that they will investigate.\"\n\nMr Trump has cast the impeachment investigation as an witch hunt, mirroring language he used to describe the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling, which included potential wrongdoing by the president as well. On the same day as Mr Taylor's testimony, Mr Trump has received criticism for comparing the impeachment inquiry to \"lynching\", dredging up the ugly history in America in which African Americans were suppressed with murder.\n\nDemocrats have indicated they want to move quickly on impeachment, and have said they could introduce articles before the end of the year. Moving quickly on the matter would allow Democrats to put as much distance as possible between the highly polarising measure and the 2020 election campaign.", "description": "The acting US ambassador to Ukraine has contradicted Donald Trump, telling House impeachment investigators that his understanding was that military aid money for the former Soviet country was contingent upon a public declaration of an investigation into the Bidens and the 2016 election.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/16/bill-taylor-ukraine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
