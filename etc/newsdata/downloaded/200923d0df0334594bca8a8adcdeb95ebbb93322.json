My pool is the perfect place to cool off from the California sun, but I never travel without my waterslide, so I\u2019ll be taking that with me. And whether you\u2019re enjoying an outdoor meal, watching a movie in my personal cinema, or making s\u2019mores under the stars, the best part is just being together.\"\n\nBooking for the Dreamhouse opens on Oct. 23 at 2 p.m. EDT. Barbie writes that the experience is a \"once in a lifetime chance, which means the Dreamhouse will only be booked once.\" The lucky guests will check in from Oct. 27 through Oct. 29. Booking is listed at $60 per night.\n\nAnd since Barbie will be out of town, she's asked a few of her friends to stop by \"to inspire and teach you new things.\" Hairstylist Jen Atkin, Fencing medalist Ibtihaj Muhammad, chef Gina Clarke-Helm and pilot/aerospace engineer Jill Meyers are all scheduled to meet guests for interactive, informative sessions on their careers.\n\nA girl with a gavel!:Barbie debuts judge dolls, partners with GoFundMe to close 'dream gap'\n\nThe Dreamhouse listing will promote its charity, The Barbie Dream Gap Project, which launched about a year ago and aims to close the \"dream gap,\" a phenomenon proven by researchers at New York University, the University of Illinois and Princeton University.\n\nThey found that stereotypes associate a high-level of intellectual ability with men more than women. Thus, when young girls are exposed to these stereotypes, they don't always pursue careers that require intelligence.\n\nThis begins at prepubescence. Girls begin to avoid those brain-stimulating activities and boys move on, creating a gap. In response, Barbie has created several dolls highlighting different careers lacking female representation. This year was Judge Barbie.\n\nContributing: Amy Haneline, USA TODAY.", "description": "Barbie is heading out of town for a few days, which means you could rent her Malibu Dreamhouse on Airbnb!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/17/USAT/5756be91-0cd0-4c2a-9091-aa1c6f5c0977-Press_HeroPhoto_01.jpg?crop=2999,1687,x1,y111&width=2530&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
