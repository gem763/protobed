You Tell Me", "language": "en", "text": "I am currently running a Twitter poll on the market. The S&P 500 has been in a tight trading range for a few months -- with the topside being about 3025 and the bottom being 2825 -- so I asked which way folks thought we would break out.\n\nPOLL time\n\nThe SPX has been trapped between 2825 and 3025 for months. Which comes first? Under 2825 or over 3025?\n\n(and no, there is no option for stay in range, pick a side--this is not 1946-1949 when we stayed in a range for 3 yrs!) \u2014 Helene Meisler (@hmeisler) October 10, 2019\n\nI did not offer an option for staying in the range, because as best I can tell the only time we stayed in such a tight range for an extended period of time was from 1946 to 1949, so it is unlikely we will stay in this range indefinitely. When I started the poll, the early voters were quick to take the \"under\" position; with 500 votes, it was 58% \"under\" and 42% \"over.\" The S&P was enjoying a midday pullback on Thursday.\n\nAs of this writing, however, the market has closed up from the midday swoon, and there are 2,400 votes. The \"over\" group is now at 52% and the \"under\" at 48%. I'd love it if you would participate. You can find it here.\n\nI would call 48-52 even, so it's possible it doesn't shift much more than that. My contention, however, is that if we get any sort of trade deal, be it a mini one or a big one, we should see this shift to \"up\" over \"down,\" because I do believe folks seem to be warming to the market as it attempts to rally.\n\nIndicator Changes\n\nWhile the intermediate-term indicators remain mixed, there are a few changes to report:\n\nThe Nasdaq Hi-Lo Indicator moved to 20%. Despite the rally of the last two days, it went down further; that's what happens when Nasdaq clocks in with 126 new lows on an up day. So, it is on the verge of pushing into oversold territory, since under 20% is oversold. The New York Stock Exchange is at 54%, so it is not close to oversold.\n\nThe McClellan Summation Index is still falling. But two days ago it required a net differential of positive 2,200 advancers minus decliners to halt the slide, thus making it short-term oversold again, and now it would need positive 1,100.\n\nThe American Association of Individual Investors -- who flop around like day traders -- saw the bulls move down to 20%, which is the same level they were at near the December low. The bears are pushing up against 44%, which is not as extreme as December or even May, when they were around 50%. So with this particular survey, there has been a vast change in sentiment.\n\nEven the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) have seen their exposure come down.\n\nOscillators\n\nOne More Question\n\nI started this column with a sentiment theme, so I will end it by noting that the question is: If we rally, how fast folks will turn bullish? We already know if we decline further, it will turn super bearish in a hurry.", "description": "So far, according to my Twitter possible, it's nearly half and half; plus, here are some of the indicator changes I've spotted.", "authors": ["Helene Meisler", "Which Way Will We Break Out", "You Tell Me", "So Far", "According To My Twitter Poll On Which Way We Break Out Of The S P Trading Range", "It'S Nearly Half", "Half", "Plus", "Here Are Some Of The Indicator Changes I'Ve Spotted.", "Bruce Kamich"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/a02d142d-e068-11e9-805f-9dafec755420.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
