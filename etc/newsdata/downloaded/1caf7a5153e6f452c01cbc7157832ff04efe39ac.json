Who the fuck decided to keep the new cinnamon donut flavour from OAK from me? Why wasn\u2019t I alerted as soon as it found its way into the supermarket, like a personal Google Alert for \u2018food mashups that probably shouldn\u2019t exist but I bet they\u2019re delicious\u2019? Show yourselves, because I\u2019m not mad, I\u2019m just very disappointed.\n\nI mean sure, I might rarely drink milk anymore and have been opting for almond milk because cow\u2019s milk sometimes makes me feel like I\u2019m going to blow chunks but still, my love for the humble cinnamon doughie is too strong.\n\nThe limited-edition milk cartons appeared at Woolies in late August, and apparently have people a bit divided \u2013 some are saying that it just tastes like vanilla milk, while others are likening it to egg nog. Which I mean, that\u2019s not a bad thing, right? It\u2019s not a donut, but it\u2019s not not disgusting.\n\nThe only thing that would make it taste a bit more like actual donuts would be if it were hot (no) or taste like cake batter or something. Maybe if it were given to me from an old duck in an apron at the local markets, and freshly coated in sugar.\n\nConsidering none of you decided to tell me anything about this, all I can go off is what\u2019s on the Woolies website. Which is that it\u2019s currently on special online for $2.10 (it\u2019s normally around three bucks) and that someone in the copywriting job over at Oak had a hell of a time with the write-up on the side of the carton.\n\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me I\u2019m going to go and put myself firmly into a dairy coma for the rest of the afternoon. Actually, I\u2019m going to get some fresh cinnamon doughboys and dip \u2019em into the donut milk. Hell yes, mates.", "description": "Oak has unleashed a Cinnamon Donut-flavoured milk for a limited time and nobody told me about it, which is quite frankly very bloody rude.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/cinnamon-oak-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
