Does it include well-placed bungee straps for storage? Is there a mount for your Go Pro? How easy is the board to inflate?\n\nAlso, SUPs need to work well on the land in terms of portability so you need to look at whether the board comes with a good backpack and a paddle that breaks down to make it easy to transport.\n\nUltimately, though, a good board will push your confidence further each time you get on it and after hours in the water in an area of protected Devon coastline and nearby estuary these are the inflatable SUPs that we think are superior.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The board is exceptionally comfortable to ride, stable to stand up on and grippy once you\u2019re up and paddling. What we really liked was the fact that you can pump the board up to two levels so if you just want to get out there and have some fun you can pump it up to the lighter weight, but if you\u2019re a heavier rider or want some more performance then you\u2019ll need more air to get it to max inflation. However, this won\u2019t be a problem as the package comes with a triple action pump that will have the board fully inflated in seven minutes flat. Reinforced rails mean you don\u2019t have to worry about scratches and bumps from rocks when you\u2019re starting out and the impressive construction translates to a safe, stiff feel in the water offering lots of glide. This means that the board is the ideal set up for touring and as your confidence builds and you get into longer distance trips you won\u2019t need to upgrade to a different model. A real all rounder.\n\nBuy now\n\niRocker all-around: \u00a3529, iRocker\n\nA slightly heavier board than we\u2019re used to from this manufacturer but that translates to durability, good movement and tracking in the water. The top deck is laid with an EVA foam traction pad that\u2019s easy on hands and feet and the bungees on the nose are great for gear and kids alike, as it makes it much easier for them to scramble up on the board. Speaking of little passengers, iRocker have included handles at the nose for kids to hang onto when they\u2019re sitting down and the Go Pro mount is placed so that it will capture both of you in frame as you head out on your adventures. The package includes a comfortable backpack, rubber-coated floating paddle and coiled leash, as well as a triple action pump for some effortless inflation. Excellent family board.\n\nBuy now\n\nBlackfin model X: \u00a3739, iRocker\n\nThis is a big board measuring up at 10\u20196\u201d long and 35\u201d wide, however because it\u2019s shaped like a touring board it\u2019s a good combination of tracking and speed that turns well for its size. There are some nice features like removable fins so you can roll the board up much tighter for storage and if you\u2019re buying more than one board for the family you can stack one on top of the other on a roof rack. The rails are overlaid with carbon fibre so it can take a bashing off rocks if a wave takes you unawares and four d-rings on the board mean that you can also attach the brand\u2019s kayak seat when you want a more leisurely paddle back to land.\n\nBuy now\n\nRed Paddle Co 9\u20194\u201d snapper: \u00a3819, Red Paddle Co\n\nFor those who want to graduate from just being a passenger on their parent\u2019s board, this is a great option for kids who want one of their own. It\u2019s 27\u201d width offers stability while keeping the fun factor and responsiveness for quicker turns and playing in the waves. For all it\u2019s maneuverability it\u2019s still a thick board, which means that it\u2019s rigid enough to act as a floating platform if they decide they\u2019ve had enough of paddling and just want to use it as a jump off point. The package includes a backpack, pump and water resistant phone case for those inevitable Insta-selfies.\n\nBuy now\n\nRed Paddle Co 12\u20196\u201d voyager: \u00a31,069, Red Paddle Co\n\nAs the name (and price tag) suggests this is a board for those who take their paddling seriously. For a big touring board it\u2019s still only 32\u201d wide, which makes it easy to handle in the waves or on the river and it did a great job of flattening out some choppy seas and making you feel secure and confident. Lots of cargo and deck space means that you can fit fishing gear and overnight kit with ease, or if you\u2019re sticking closer to home and taking one of the kids out with you there\u2019s plenty of passenger space up front. We had it inflated in around seven minutes with the pump that comes as part of the package.\n\nBuy now\n\nFanatic Fly air premium: \u00a3702.21, Fanatic\n\nOne of the first things we noticed when we jumped on the Fly Air was that it gave us a nice raised paddling position on the water so that we could really get into our strokes and cover ground fast. It tracked really well and the stiffness meant that we were able to get plenty of glide over the water, which made the board really easy to power without getting tired arms. Inflated in eight minutes this is an excellent all round board that is great for anyone who doesn\u2019t want too much of a workout when they head out for the day.\n\nBuy now\n\nProtest air: \u00a3749.99, Protest\n\nFully inflated in 10 minutes there is very little flex in this colourful offering that\u2019s nice and stable on the water and very portable out of it. We found this was one of the most comfortable boards to stand on with a good mix of traction and comfort so your feet don\u2019t go numb when you\u2019re out for hours at a time. It had a profile that was more akin to a surfboard too, so there\u2019s plenty of fun to be had trying tricks and turns in the breakers.\n\nBuy now\n\niRocker cruiser: \u00a3549, iRocker\n\nAn excellent beginner\u2019s board that\u2019s made for calmer waters and lakes thanks to its 33\u201d width and a squared off tail which makes it stable with much less movement side to side when paddling. The board is really well made and you won\u2019t have to worry about damage if you get up close and personal with jagged rocks or riverbanks while you\u2019re learning. We inflated it in around seven minutes with the excellent pump that\u2019s included in the package along with an adjustable, fiberglass paddle, back pack, leash and repair kit.\n\nBuy now\n\nThurso Surf waterwalker: \u00a3574, Amazon\n\nWe really liked the shape of this board and we liked it even more when we got it out on the water because it\u2019s very quick. This is a good option for the more confident riders out there as it\u2019s adaptable to seas, rivers and lakes and its shape, design and weight allows you to try out manoeuvres like the step back turn, where you shift your body to the back of the board and lift the nose up so that you turn more easily out of tight spots. Quick inflation and the addition of Velcro straps for securing your paddle when you\u2019re not using it are also very welcome.\n\nBuy now\n\nDecathlon ITIWIT X100: \u00a3349.99, Decathlon\n\nA good starter board that\u2019s stable in the water thanks to its 34\u201d width, and a good weight so that inexperienced paddlers will never feel like they\u2019re out of control. The X100 tracked well in the sea and up river and the deck was comfortable enough for an afternoon spent on your feet. Pump and paddle aren\u2019t included and this will set you back another \u00a360 on the decathlon site. Even with the added expense this is a value option \u2013 perfect for the paddler who has been out for a couple of sessions on a rented board and needs to work on technique and build confidence.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Stand-up paddle boards\n\nIf you want to expand your horizons then the Quoroc Qi Crossover 11\u20194 is the board that will get you there.
