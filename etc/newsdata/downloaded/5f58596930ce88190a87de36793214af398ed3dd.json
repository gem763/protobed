VEUER\u2019s Johana Restrepo has more. Buzz60\n\nCHIBA, Japan \u2014 A day at the movies Friday turned into a long stay at Domino's for Tiger Woods.\n\nAfter storms washed out the second round of the Zozo Championship at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club, Woods, who grabbed a share of the lead with a 6-under-par 64 in the opening round, and five other players decided to go to a local movie theater for an afternoon showing of \"Joker.\"\n\nAll was good until after the movie ended, when the crew was told the tournament courtesy vans that drove them to the theater weren't able to go back to the hotel. The storms were so powerful roads were undrivable in numerous areas, public transportation was shut down and no taxis or Ubers were available.\n\nSo, the gang \u2014 Woods, Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, Gary Woodland, Bubba Watson and Ryan Palmer \u2014 along with a couple of friends headed to a nearby Domino's. There were no tables in the restaurant yet the group ordered six pies \u2014 thin crust \u2014 and stood there and ate.\n\nAnd killed time. And some more time. Woods and his girlfriend, Erica Herman, eventually went across the street to a 7-Eleven and only two fans asked the most famous golfer in the world for a selfie.\n\nFinally, after just over 90 minutes, the streets cleared up and the group got back to the hotel in less than 15 minutes.\n\nFollow Golfweek's Steve DiMeglio on Twitter @Steve_DiMeglio.", "description": "A day at the movies Friday in Japan turned into a long stay at Domino's for Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and other golfers.", "authors": ["Steve Dimeglio", "Published A.M.
