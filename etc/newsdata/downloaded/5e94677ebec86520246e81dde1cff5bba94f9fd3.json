Though the reason for it is hardly unfathomable, given their history of being a leading indicator of corporate turbulence.\n\nIn our time covering 3Y notices, we've read every excuse under the sun. But rarely have we come across a statement so transparent.\n\nAdelaide-based welding-as-a-service minnow (they're trying to make a thing) K-Tig listed two weeks ago. And last Friday, director Kieran Purcell, the general manager of Morgans in South Australia, sold every single share he owned that wasn't under escrow.\n\nHis reason? According to the notice, \"personal asset management purposes\".\n\nIn other words, he sold 9 per cent of his stake for $296,334 the moment he saw any liquidity because it was in his best financial interests to do so. Nothing could be more honest! Or shameless. We'll let readers take their pick.\n\nThis kind of thing won't be a problem for the directors of Onsite Rental, whose owners hope to list on the ASX within three weeks. These owners are a bunch of US funds, and most decidedly not the board members they've chosen to oversee things for them.\n\nAccording to the 205-page pathfinder document sent to potential investors recently, not one of its directors \u2013 with the exception of CEO Michael Foureur \u2013 will own a single share after the float. And they won't ever have to, the document adds, there being no shareholding requirement on directors.\n\nOnsite Rental's unencumbered board includes chairman Francis Browne, a former Macquarie and Credit Suisse investment banker, along with ex-Elders boss Malcolm Jackman and professional directors Giselle Collins and Stephanie Lai.", "description": "In our time covering 3Y notices, we've read every excuse under the sun.
