Racing rather than academia always beckoned for Leclerc but right now, in the pressure-cooker environment of driving for Ferrari, this young driver is learning an awful lot of lessons. Every indication is that they are being taken to heart, forging a formidable character.\n\nAt last weekend\u2019s Russian Grand Prix, Ferrari\u2019s plan to govern their drivers through the opening corners fell apart publicly and with lasting ramifications. With Leclerc on pole and his teammate Sebastian Vettel in third, the team were focused on keeping Lewis Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes, starting in second, away from the lead. To do so their arrangement was that Leclerc would give Vettel a slipstream into turn two, and if the German gained an advantage in doing so and took the lead, they would then swap positions.\n\nLewis Hamilton wins Russia F1 GP as Vettel ignores orders before retiring Read more\n\nVettel enjoyed a great start, passed Hamilton and then took the slipstream and the lead. What followed was classic Ferrari and classic Vettel. The team ordered the swap, Vettel refused as an aggrieved Leclerc questioned why the deal was being ignored. Ultimately Ferrari got their place change through the pit stops, giving Leclerc a strong undercut, although the principal, Mattia Binotto, argued somewhat unconvincingly that it was not deliberate. In a way Ferrari were fortunate that further friction between the two on track was avoided when Vettel retired with a mechanical failure and Leclerc finished in third behind both Mercedes.\n\nThat left Binotto and Ferrari with considerable damage-control to deal with. There was Vettel, blatantly ignoring team orders. Then the use of such complex and unnecessary diktats in a season where the championship is gone, allied to their clumsy implementation and lack of planing for the not-unlikely scenario that Vettel was quicker. Finally there was Leclerc, unhappy but still playing the team game afterwards, expressing publicly that he still trusted Vettel. Binotto suggested the solution lay in defining plans with greater complexity. \u201cMaybe we have to be more precise before the races,\u201d he said.\n\nPlay Video 1:00 F1: Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc react to Ferrari disobedience \u2013 video\n\nLeclerc will likely draw a simpler conclusion. He was witness to the ruthless, victory-driven Vettel of the Multi21 incident. In Malaysia in 2013, when Vettel overtook Mark Webber against his Red Bull team\u2019s \u201chold station\u201d Multi21 order for the win, this hard edge was clear. \u201cMy intention if you look at it as a racing driver is to win the race,\u201d Vettel said afterwards. \u201cSo I don\u2019t apologise for winning the race.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday evening in Sochi, sat beside Binotto and Vettel, Leclerc\u2019s response surely reflected his new understanding of where he stands with Vettel. \u201cIn the car there was an agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nWhen Max Verstappen pushed Leclerc wide at Austria this year, the Monegasque insisted it was a lesson learned. \u201cI think I will just conclude that we can go a bit further in our aggressiveness on track,\u201d he said. When he went toe to toe with Verstappen at Silverstone, he was unforgiving about getting his elbows in. At Monza Hamilton discovered Leclerc had still not forgotten Austria when he squeezed the world champion wide with calculated control on his way to victory.\n\nHe will have taken similar lessons from Russia. Ferrari may wish to make ever more intricate arrangements for their drivers, but Leclerc will now have no qualms about pursuing his own ends with the same ruthlessness Vettel displayed.\n\nFerrari create 'a war' while F1 continues to meddle with the rules | Giles Richards Read more\n\nRoss Brawn, F1\u2019s sporting director and technical director at Ferrari during Michael Schumacher\u2019s successful years at the team, described Leclerc as an \u201cincredible talent\u201d after Russia. In Brawn\u2019s time at Ferrari the Scuderia were no strangers to using team orders and he recognised the difficulty of now maintaining harmony at Ferrari. \u201cIt\u2019s a potentially explosive combination and needs careful handling,\u201d he said, stressing that the pressure was now really on Binotto to manage his drivers. \u201cAfter today we will be even more aggressive,\u201d Binotto said on Sunday. \u201cThird place hurts us, because this result is the result of our mistakes.\u201d\n\nYet he must consider that one of his drivers will now need no encouragement to be similarly combative toward his teammate. This year Leclerc has suffered bad luck \u2013 the mechanical problem at Bahrain that cost him a win \u2013 and made mistakes, such as his crash in qualifying at Baku. But he has delivered some brilliant performances: qualifying in Singapore and the wins at Spa and Monza. It is worth remembering that Hamilton came through a similar crucible in his first season and followed it with his first title.\n\nThroughout it all Leclerc has maintained that every event has been positive in his development as a driver. Given his form, the embrace of these experiences is only making him stronger. Leclerc is rapidly becoming a fearsome graduate of F1\u2019s school of hard knocks.", "description": "Ferrari\u2019s meltdown at the Russian Grand Prix was just the latest tough lesson for Charles Leclerc in his debut season, but he shows every sign of becoming a formidable force in F1", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3303592958310a4c3b3ce0a14f8b8dde2e48975c/0_0_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=674b454340032b403d1fea74b9183889"}
