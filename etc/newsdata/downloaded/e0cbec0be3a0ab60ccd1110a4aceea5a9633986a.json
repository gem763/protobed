It killed Ghost Rider.\n\nDeadline reports the streaming service has pulled the plug on the planned show citing \u201ca creative impasse which could not be resolved.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unknown if Marvel will be able, or wants to, shop Ghost Rider to another outlet \u2014 or perhaps even bring it over to Disney\u2019s other streaming service, the upcoming Disney+ \u2014 but the other series announced for Hulu alongside Ghost Rider, Helstrom, is apparently still in the works.\n\nGhost Rider was set to star Terminator: Dark Fate\u2019s Gabriel Luna as the supernatural character, reprising his role as the Robbie Reyes incarnation of Ghost Rider, who first appeared in this form on Agents of SHIELD.\n\nThis is obviously a very recent development because, just a few short weeks back, Gizmodo spoke with Luna about the show and he was very excited about it. \u201cI love that we have a whole wonderful, beautiful writer\u2019s room right now, just exploring Robbie\u2019s psychology,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWe get to continue to add to the canon, because it seems like everything we do with Robbie is just we\u2019re pushing the canon. He\u2019s existed since 2014. So we\u2019re just adding more and more and more to this great story of Robbie Reyes\u2019 Ghost Rider.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll have more on Ghost Rider if it gets possessed by an evil force and comes back to life.", "description": "American streaming service Hulu just did something hundreds of evil villains couldn\u2019t do in the pages of Marvel Comics.
