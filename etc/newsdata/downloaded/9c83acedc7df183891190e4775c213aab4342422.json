A camera and a Samsung Galaxy S10 5G smartphone are said to be inside the box\n\nA piece of debris emblazoned with the 'SAMSUNG' logo is seen on the ground in the image above\n\nThe four-legged device was attached to a red balloon that got stuck in the tree\n\nThe contraption appears to be an exact replica of the device seen in the promotional image above released by Samsung to tout its 'space selfie' initiative\n\nThe device appears to be the same one attached to a high-altitude balloon that Samsung launched toward the edge of space from South Dakota.\n\nWelke, a resident of Merrill, Michigan, said she heard a loud noise just before 8:45am on Saturday, when she and her husband were about to let the horses out of their barn.\n\n'You never know what's gonna happen,' Welke says in the Facebook video posted on Saturday.\n\n'This baby fell out of the sky and landed in our yard.\n\n'It's never boring on the Welke farm.\n\n'Thank god there's no horses out and it didn't hit the house.\n\n'And it's still going and flashing.'\n\nThe four-legged object with an aluminum foil-wrapped box and solar panels attached to the top of it, was launched on Wednesday during a promotional event in London attended by model Cara Delevingne.\n\nInside the box were two large cameras and a Samsung cell phone believed to be its latest version of the Galaxy model smartphone devices, the S10 5G.\n\nAt around the time that the satellite crash landed in Michigan, residents of Gratiot County received a warning to avoid the area near Wheeler, where 'the fire department has [the] roadway closed due to a large object caught in live power lines.'\n\nThe idea was to promote the new model Samsung Galaxy S10 5G as a device capable of functioning while withstanding the rigors of atmospheric travel. The above image of Cara Delevingne shows what Samsung says is the first ever selfie beamed into space\n\nA number of local residents had their electricity cut off for two hours while crews worked to remove the deflated balloon, according to ABC News.\n\nThe device was sent to the edges of the earth's atmosphere as part of a promotion by Samsung Europe, according to the company web site.\n\nThe idea was to promote the new model Samsung Galaxy S10 5G as a device capable of functioning while withstanding the rigors of atmospheric travel.\n\n'With over 200 hours at 65,000 feet above the earth, the S10 5G will showcase the strength of Samsung's innovations and how it continues to design products that make what was previously impossible, possible,' the company said on its web site announcing the SpaceSelfie event.\n\nThe idea behind SpaceSelfie sees Samsung customers submit their selfie to the Mission Control website to have their image snapped in space.\n\nIt uses two Galaxy S10 5G smartphones, one of which has been lifted 65,000 feet above the earth in a giant helium balloon able to withstand temperatures of up to -85\u00b0F.\n\nThe other phone is located at Samsung's KX experience in London's Kings Cross, where Delevingne promoted the event.\n\nShe demonstrated the technology by sending selfies to the space phone to be layered over real-time shots of the planet creating a bespoke, limited edition image.\n\nThese are then returned back to the subject, on Earth.\n\nThose sending selfies will be entered into a competition, which closes on Halloween.", "description": "Nancy Welke of Merrill, Michigan, posted video of the contraption on Saturday morning which had the words 'SPACE SELFIE' written on it.
