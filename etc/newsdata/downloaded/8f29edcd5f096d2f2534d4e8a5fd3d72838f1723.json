The 43-year-old was hired in 2016 and has helped the Diamondbacks stay competitive in the NL West, though they\u2019ve finished behind the Dodgers each year.\n\nThe Diamondbacks traded ace Zack Greinke in July in a surprise move, adding prospects that could eventually help the team\u2019s promising core of Ketel Marte, Eduardo Escobar, Nick Ahmed, David Peralta and Christian Walker.\n\nHazen\u2019s name had been linked to the GM opening with the Boston Red Sox after they recently fired Dave Dombrowski. Hazen worked in the Red Sox front office before being hired by the Diamondbacks.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Arizona Diamondbacks have extended the contract of general manager Mike Hazen.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
