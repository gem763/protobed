That has raised expectations the RBI will be forced to further downgrade its growth projection of 6.9% for the current fiscal year.\n\nHowever, not all economists were as aggressive with their rate cut bets, saying the central bank will likely reserve some firepower and wait to see how inflation pans out.\n\nIn a bid to revive business activity, the government in September announced a sharp cut in the corporate tax rate - to 22% from 30%.\n\nBut while the tax cut brings the cost of doing business in India into line with its main Asian rivals, the government\u2019s move will do little to fix a lack of spending power, economists say.\n\n\u201cThe recent volatility in crude oil prices and the fiscal measures announced by the government will have an impact on inflation in the medium-term and the fiscal deficit,\u201d said Shanti Ekambaram, president of consumer banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank.\n\n\u201cHence, expect the MPC to be more measured in its response with a rate cut of 20-25 bps,\u201d she added.\n\nInflation in August accelerated to a 10-month high but remained well below the central bank\u2019s medium-term target of 4% for a 13th straight month.\n\nIf the RBI delivers a 25 bps cut as expected, traders will focus on the wording and tone of the monetary policy statement for clues on further easing.\n\nEconomists also said the policy transmission process could improve after the RBI mandated banks to link all fresh loans to an external benchmark like the repo rate or the rate on short-term treasury bills since the start of this month.\n\nIndia\u2019s banks have passed only a small portion of the RBI\u2019s cuts this year to their customers.", "description": "The Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut benchmark interest rates for the fifth time this year on Friday as recent fiscal measures to boost ailing growth seem largely inadequate and benign inflation offers room for more easing.", "authors": ["Swati Bhat", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436141069&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910DC"}
