It\u2019s a bird! It\u2019s a plane! It\u2019s the inevitable Superman expansion of the Arrowverse on the CW! News broke today that the House of Berlanti is now at work on Superman & Lois, which would star Tyler Hoechlin and Elizabeth Tulloch reprising the roles they have previously played on the network\u2019s superhero programming. Berlanti will write the script with The Flash showrunner Todd Helbing \u2014 who left that post earlier this year to focus on this new script \u2014 and while it\u2019s not officially green-lit yet, it seems crazy to think the CW would pass on adding the Man of Steel to its massive DC lineup. The narrative focus sounds somewhat grounded, dealing with \u201call the stress, pressures and complexities that come with being working parents in today\u2019s society.\u201d Surely there will be some crime fighting thrown in, too, but also, PTA meetings? May you live long enough to see your favorite superheroes become boring parents.", "description": "The CW is finally adding a Man of Steel show to its Arrowverse lineup with \u201cSuperman & Lois,\u201d which will star Tyler Hoechlin and Elizabeth Tulloch.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/28/28-tyler-hoechlin-superman.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
