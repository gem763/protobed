REUTERS/Kham/File Photo\n\nThe sight has become such a draw in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi that authorities have set a weekend deadline for the removal of dozens of cafes that have cropped up, citing safety concerns.\n\n\u201cI love it. It\u2019s crazy, and completely different to anywhere I\u2019ve been before,\u201d said Australian tourist Laura Metze, after a train rumbled by.\n\n\u201cI can also see why they would close it down because it\u2019s pretty dangerous.\u201d\n\nBuilt in 1902 under French colonial rulers, the railway to Vietnam\u2019s northern provinces carries passengers and cargo mostly between Hanoi and the eastern city of Haiphong, and the remote towns of Lang Son and Lao Cai, on the mountainous border with China.\n\nIt uses an old-fashioned French narrow gauge, and is so old that when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited Hanoi in February for a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, he had to stop at the border and continue by car.\n\nIn Hanoi, the line brushes the rear of houses and shops as it snakes through the city\u2019s dense centre. Vendors stroll on the tracks, selling snacks on skewers, while some visitors sit on the railway lines and soak in the vibe.\n\nIn recent months, crowds of tourists have gathered along the railway to snap selfies with passing trains or lounge at trackside cafes.\n\nOn Sunday, a train had to make an emergency stop soon after leaving Hanoi railway station to avoid hitting tourists, state media said.\n\nThe next day, the city\u2019s governing body ordered the cafes removed by Saturday to \u201censure traffic safety\u201d, at the request of the transport ministry.\n\n\u201cThough the railway cafes attract tourists, they are, in fact, violating some regulations,\u201d Ha Van Sieu, a government tourism official, told media on Tuesday.\n\nNew and creative tourism products are encouraged, but must conform to legal regulations, Sieu added.\n\nVietnam received 12.87 million foreign visitors in the first nine months of this year, up nearly 11% on the year, government data shows.", "description": "It's the kind of shot every Instagram connoisseur yearns for: century-old railway tracks cutting through dusty backstreets, flanked by tourists drinking beer or iced tea mere inches from the slow-moving trains.", "authors": ["Khanh Vu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438740893&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980FG", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
