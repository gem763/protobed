The protesters are expressing anger over widespread unemployment and corruption, as well as electricity outages and water shortages that result from years of conflict that have left much of the country's infrastructure in shambles.\n\nSecurity forces have responded to the protests with live ammunition, water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets. Authorities have also cut Internet service in the capital and across much of the country.\n\nMany of the protesters have called on the government to step down.\n\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi, who took over as premier just a year ago, appeared on television in an effort to placate protesters and persuade them to go home, saying their \"legitimate demands\" would be heard.\n\n\"The security measures we are taking, including temporary curfew, are difficult choices,\" he said. \"But like bitter medicine, they are inevitable.\"\n\n\"We have to return life to normal in all provinces and respect the law,\" Abdul-Mahdi implored, adding that there were \"no magic solutions\" to Iraq's problems.\n\nHe promised to work toward a basic income for poor families, housing for squatters and to fight corruption, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThis is Iraq\u2019s \u201cGreen revolution \u201c moment, do not let us regret the global reaction later on. #Iraq was set on a very dark path filled with corruption, war lords and a weak government that was caring more for the interest of neighbors than Iraq\u2019s interest ,to correct the course pic.twitter.com/DIrP0phcVy \u2014 Steven nabil (@thestevennabil) October 2, 2019\n\nOn Friday, Iraqi officials added 9 more deaths in the southern city of Nasiriya to the those killed previously, bringing the total to 42.\n\nThe response to the protests has drawn international opprobrium, with Amnesty International accusing Baghdad of using \"lethal and unnecessary force.\"\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross has pointed to \"increasingly violent clashes\" between demonstrators and security forces and warned that \"firearms and live ammunition must only be used as a last resort.\"", "description": "The violence first erupted on Tuesday and has spread across Baghdad and much of the country's mainly Shiite south.
