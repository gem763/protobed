So when six Young Post readers won the Up Your Game Challenge, it marked the beginning of a two-month fitness journey to become the best version of themselves and to take part in Mud Race 2019.\n\nThe team, named Predators, will be taking on the six-kilometre Youth Team obstacle course at the Mud Race on April 28. To prepare for the race, they are working with a personal trainer at F45 Sheung Wan, and nutritionist Wynnie Chan.\n\nTwo weeks into the programme, we caught up with the students to find out what it\u2019s been like so far.\n\nI\u2019m generally someone who enjoys taking on new challenges, and the Mud Race is a great opportunity for me to meet new people and challenge myself. Initially, I was quite worried because I wasn\u2019t sure whether I would be fit enough to compete.\n\nBut with the motivation from the YP team, my family and friends, I decided to go for it.\n\nThe first couple of days were quite difficult to manage, as I had to keep to a strict eating plan and give 100 per cent during training sessions. But the support and encouragement from our trainer and the rest of my team has really helped me.\n\nI have always been a fitness enthusiast and enjoy doing a variety of sports. But I have never took part in an obstacle course before, so this is going to be a really valuable experience. Thank you, Young Post, for this really exciting opportunity!\n\nSaanchi Shah, 15, King George V School\n\nHealth mythbusters: 7 common beliefs about exercise and fitness explained by a pro\n\nThe F45 training exceeded my expectations. I thought it\u2019d be pretty easy, but I realised I was wrong as soon as I showed up for the first session.\n\nHowever, thanks to my supportive teammates, I was able to overcome the challenge. I made a new friend named David, which made me realise that being surrounded by positive people truly makes any challenge easier to overcome.\n\nBy the second session, I was more prepared, so it got relatively easier. I\u2019m excited to continue these training sessions, and I look forward to competing in the Mud Race.\n\nMohammad Ans, 18, CSBS Mrs Aw Boon Haw Secondary School\n\nHow to balance exercise and nutrition to improve your fitness, health, and lifestyle\n\nI still can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m in this challenge. I am so grateful that I get to do something I\u2019ve been wanting to do for so long: working with a personal coach, getting tailor-made advice from a nutritionist, and joining an obstacle race! It\u2019s all new to me.\n\nBefore the training, I had so many worries. For example, I was worried I wouldn\u2019t get along with my teammates, and my biggest worry was that I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the training.\n\nDuring the HIIT (high-intensity interval training), I thought a thousand times about giving up. But when I looked at my teammates, I found that they were all experiencing the same difficulties as me, so I told myself, \u201cHang in there, Esther! You\u2019re not alone!\u201d\n\nThe fact that we\u2019re all going through this together has helped to bring us closer.\n\nEsther Choy Lok-yiu, 16, PAOC Ka Chi Secondary School\n\nHow stretching everyday can benefit your physical and mental health, and improve your problem solving skills\n\nI went into this challenge expecting it to be difficult, given that my fitness level is below average. Even so, I shared my teammates\u2019 vision of crossing the finish line of the Mud Race. With them by my side, how hard could it really be?\n\nI soon found out how difficult the road to victory was going to be. The first couple of sessions were gruelling, to say the least. For someone like me who doesn\u2019t typically do such high-intensity workouts, the learning curve was steep.\n\nThere were countless times during the first few sessions that I had to grit my teeth through the pain as I tried to complete each exercise. Even though I couldn\u2019t go as fast or far as my teammates, I put my all into the training.\n\nAs we persevered, tired and sweating but cheering each other on, I felt a sense of camaraderie among the team. We all try to lift each other\u2019s spirits.\n\nThat\u2019s why the people involved, from the staff at Young Post to our trainers and nutritionist, and of course my teammates, have become my favourite part of this challenge.\n\nAngelina Wang, 17, Chinese International School\n\nThis is how a vegetarian diet affects your body, mind, and overall health\n\nI\u2019m really pleased and excited to be a part of the Mud Race Up Your Game Challenge. It\u2019s only been two weeks since the start of challenge, and everything is already better than I\u2019d expected. The training and the team are just the best.\n\nThe type of training F45 Sheung Wan uses \u2013 HIIT \u2013 will help us gain as much strength as possible in the shortest amount of time. It\u2019s also helping us gain stamina, and teaching us the techniques we\u2019ll need for the Mud Race.\n\nEach training session is only 45 minutes long, but all my muscles ache afterwards. This is a good thing, because it means I\u2019m using them, and helping them grow, every time I train.\n\nAs for the team, everyone is really friendly and supportive. We\u2019re all into different sports, but every time we meet we always find a topic we can all relate to. During the training, I can tell that everyone is doing their best.\n\nSeeing the team work hard really motivates me to do better, both mentally and physically. I have high hopes for the race and I think my team will do great in it.\n\nDavid Cheng, 18, St Joseph\u2019s Anglo-Chinese School\n\nQualified personal trainer shares 5 tips on how to avoid workout injuries\n\nI\u2019m very grateful to Young Post for the opportunity to participate in the Up Your Game Challenge and the Mud Race. I\u2019ve found the first two weeks of training to be challenging because I had no idea how physically demanding it would be.\n\nEven though I play basketball, it\u2019s a very different type of workout to HIIT. Basketball focuses on physical fitness and skills; it is nothing like this kind of fitness that trains different muscles, so this feels relatively harder.\n\nHowever, after even just two weeks of training, I\u2019ve really found that my muscles are stronger.\n\nLaw Ka-yi, 19, HKU Space Po Leung Kuk Stanley Ho Community College\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "Meet the students being put through their paces to compete in Hong Kong\u2019s muckiest obstacle course, the Mud Race.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/mr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
