It read, \u201cPower\u2019s not given to you. You have to take it.\u201d\n\n\u201c@Beyonce speaks the truth,\u201d Clinton wrote as her caption alongside the hashtag #GutsyWomen \u2014 an homage to her latest children\u2019s book.\n\nClinton\u2019s comment was met with a load of backlash from commenters.\n\n\u201cOr in your case, buy it,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be contradicting the principles of democracy!\u201d another reminded the failed Trump challenger.\n\n\u201cAnd you have stolen yours,\u201d another commented. \u201cCorruption is your power.\u201d\n\nHowever, there were also many users who praised Clinton for essentially courting Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s fan base, which refers to itself as the \u201cBeyhive.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake that White House, Hillary!!\u201d one wrote, with another adding, \u201cI hope Beyonc\u00e9 is the first woman president.\u201d\n\nThe post also fueled speculation surrounding the possibility of a 2020 run, which Clinton has teased in recent weeks. Earlier this month, President Trump tweeted that \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d should join the race \u201cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u201d as long as she explains \u201call of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d\n\nClinton replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 8, 2019\n\nHer recent remarks on PBS NewsHour furthered speculation. Clinton told the outlet that she could \u201cobviously\u201d beat Trump \u201cagain.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d\n\nPolitical commentator and former Bill Clinton adviser Dick Morris said this week that there is a chance the former secretary of state will launch another presidential bid.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s always possible that Hillary runs,\u201d Morris said during an appearance on The Cats Roundtable on Sunday. \u201cYou know, John, there\u2019s a test you can do at home. Just put your fingers on her wrist, and if you feel a pulse, you know she\u2019s going to run.\u201d\n\nThis is far from the first time Clinton has tried to use the Grammy-winning singer to boost her political and cultural status. Clinton made an appearance at Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cget-out-the-vote rally\u201d in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2016, where Beyonc\u00e9 delivered a passionate speech in support of the then-Democrat nominee.\n\n\u201cWe have to vote. The world looks to us as a progressive country that leads change. Eight years ago, I was so inspired that my nephew, a young black child, could grow up knowing his dreams could be realized by witnessing a black president in office,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. \u201cAnd now, we have the opportunity to create more change. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to think about the future of our daughters, of our sons, and vote for someone who cares for them as much as we do,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd that is why, \u2018I\u2019m with her.'\u201d", "description": "Hillary Clinton on Tuesday kicked up more 2020 buzz after posting a quote from pop megastar Beyonc\u00e9 about the need to take power.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Beyoncehillary1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
