It had to be removed in 1985 for wall repairs but it survived and was put back into its original position in 1987.\n\nThe Drive Oak, Gloucester\n\nImage copyright Julian Hight/Woodland Trust/PA Media\n\nThis tree has guarded the entrance to Wick Court farm for hundreds of years and may have been there when Elizabeth I came from Berkeley Castle, having been reprimanded for killing too many stags.\n\nNow children come to stay from inner-city primary schools, and study the oak as part of a bird survey.", "description": "Ten contenders have been shortlisted to be crowned England's Tree of the Year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2397/production/_103911190_ca35e4d2-91fd-43af-af60-5359fd8da0d7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
