Picture: Alex Coppel.\n\nThe change would recognise the custodians and traditional owners of the land, while respecting its rich history, pre-colonial settlement, it said.\n\n\u201cWe did this with Uluru, so why not the Yarra?\u201d Melbourne Water\u2019s Kate Nagato said.\n\nMark Rowland, transport and cities planning associate at consultants Arup, said several forum participants had raised the idea of co-naming or changing the Yarra River title.\n\n\u201cIt was highlighted that the Yarra River Protection Act is the first act in Victorian history to be co-titled in Woi-wurrung, giving traditional owners a permanent voice in the planning and management of the Yarra River,\u2019\u2019 Mr Rowland said.\n\nDr Bella d\u2019Abrera, director of the Foundations of Western Civilisation program at the Institute of Public Affairs, said the name change push was another example of \u201cempty virtue-signalling favoured by an inner- city progressive elite\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd yet the council still has plans for things like a floating swimming pool and garden over the historic Sandridge Bridge, all which are clearly not in keeping with Yarra\u2019s pre-colonial history,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the Victorian Government established a new statutory body, the Birrarung Council.\u2019\u2019 The council advises the government about how to best use the Yarra for community and recreational use as well as protecting the river\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cAnd of course there are already locations like Birrarung Marr.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe original Yarra Yarra name itself has indigenous roots, either from a misappropriation of Boonwurrung words \u201cYarro-yarro\u2019\u2019 which means \u201cever-flowing\u2019\u2019 or meaning \u201criver of mists\u201d.\n\nAnd the city council\u2019s recent Draft City River Strategy refers to \u201cthe Birrarung\u201d more than Yarra.\n\nmedia_camera An artist\u2019s impression of the Yarra Pool, which would rejuvenate Enterprise Park.\n\nBOLD BID TO REVIVE AND RENAME OUR RIVER\n\nA river walk to rival Europe\u2019s famed promenades, a floating swimming pool and garden over historic Sandridge Bridge are among the proposals to revitalise the Yarra River.\n\nA new inner-city ferry service running from Spotswood to Chapel St and overhauling the river\u2019s under-utilised North Bank have also been mooted.\n\nThere are also demands for a single authority to take charge of the waterway amid criticism one of Melbourne\u2019s biggest assets is being neglected.\n\nYarra River Business Association president John Forman, leading a group of traders demanding change, said it was time for the city to embrace its main river.\n\n\u201cFor too long, Melbourne has turned its back on the river, now it has turned side on but it needs to turn and face it,\u2019\u2019 Mr Forman said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer. The waterway is the lifeblood of the city.\u2019\u2019\n\nmedia_camera Sandridge Bridge would get more greenery under the plans. Picture: Alex Coppel.\n\nBusiness and government leaders including Lord Mayor Sally Capp are developing several initiatives to revamp the iconic waterway, raising proposals at the recent Yarra River Business Association Big Ideas Forum.\n\nThe proposed \u201cBirrarung Walk\u201d would stretch 2.5km from Swan Street Bridge to Seafarers Bridge, which connects Docklands to South Wharf.\n\nIt would mirror Barcelona\u2019s famed Las Ramblas boulevard using \u201c10 great things to do\u201d to lure visitors using attractions focused on sustainability.\n\nThe walk has been touted as Melbourne\u2019s \u201cnext big attraction\u201d akin to Brisbane\u2019s South Bank and Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay.\n\nGreenery over historic Sandridge Bridge would continue into Queens Bridge Square in entice people to use it while initiatives like a floating swimming pool are proposed to link the Yarra\u2019s North Bank with Southbank.\n\n\u201cPublic bathing, lap swimming, kids\u2019 recreation. It\u2019s what the Yarra should be about,\u2019\u2019 one forum respondent said.\n\nThe northern bank between Sandridge Bridge and Spencer St has been identified as a priority with more access points to the city and a better use of the Banana Alley vaults mooted.\n\nOther suggestions include decking over the train tracks east of Flinders Street Station beside Federation Square to create a new civic space, improving run-down Enterprize Park and establishing a commuter ferry similar to Brisbane\u2019s river cats within five years.\n\nMark Rowland, transport and cities planning associate at consultants Arup, said the Yarra should be regarded as Melbourne\u2019s \u201cblue civic spine\u201d with inner-city sections potential major new tourist attractions if they were improved.\n\n\u201cImagine in the future when people visit our great state and ask: \u2018What are the must dos in Melbourne?\u2019 and the reply from a local is: \u2018You must experience the Birrarung Walk and visit the amazing places along it\u2019,\u2019\u2019 Mr Rowland said.\n\nEnterprize Park, Batman Park and the \u201cstressed, busy and noisy\u201d Southbank Promenade were identified as the least liked riverside areas.\n\nThe Banana Alley area was described as \u201cdark, dingy, run-down, unsafe and un-utilised\u2019\u2019 and\n\nSeaLife Aquarium seen as disconnected from the river.\n\nmedia_camera Artist\u2019s impression on a way to revitalise the Banana Alley vaults. Image: Arup\n\nMr Rowland said an independent commission was one way to streamline management of the river.\n\nSeveral agencies including Parks Victoria, Melbourne City Council and Melbourne Water share control under existing arrangements.\n\nCommitting to implement 30 ideas to improve the river between Richmond and Docklands over the next decade was another possible solution.\n\nMr Forman cited the example of the aquatic sculptures placed midstream during the 2006 Commonwealth Games as a way of making the river an engaging place.\n\n\u201cEveryone remembers the games fish to this day,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how activations can work for people, whether it\u2019s art or something else.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Lord Mayor, who has proposed a \u201cgreen\u201d trail linking the Royal Botanic Gardens with Marvel Stadium, said Melbourne\u2019s green spaces should mirror London\u2019s famous Hyde Park, St James Park and other parks and gardens.\n\nMelbourne City Council is developing plans to improve the inner city section of the river, which includes highlighting its aboriginal history and opening up the iconic waterway to the public.\n\nmedia_camera Elizabeth Spicer, Taylor and Gigi take a ride on a GoBoat on the Yarra River.
