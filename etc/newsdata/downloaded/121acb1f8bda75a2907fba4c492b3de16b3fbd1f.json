Trying to bridge the conflicting interests between the world's two largest economies is a gargantuan task; an undertaking that has already proven to be protracted and complicated,\" said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, in a note.\n\nSpeaking with reporters in London, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said investors might be too optimistic about how long it takes to reach trade deals (link). He also emphasized that data on consumption, while strong, was \"backwards looking\" and said that was why he has been \"emphasizing these downside risks and also emphasizing pre-emptive types of action to stay out of recession.\"\n\nBullard dissented last month (link) from the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter point, calling instead for half-point decrease.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Wall Street's biggest banks were set to deliver earnings ahead of the bell.
