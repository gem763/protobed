The government has subpoenaed former employees in recent months, the people said.\n\nThe investigations have at times looked into Purdue\u2019s possible failure to report doctors who were illegally prescribing opioids and the company\u2019s order-monitoring systems, the people said. The government has also considered charges under \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise\u201d statutes typically used to prosecute drug dealers.\n\nThe talks are heating up at a critical time for Purdue and its owners, the Sackler family, as they grapple with the future of the company and work to resolve legal issues on multiple fronts over Oxycontin and its alleged role in the opioid crisis.\n\nA Purdue spokesman declined to comment Friday. Spokesmen for the Justice Department and U.S. attorneys in Connecticut, New Jersey and Vermont declined to comment.\n\nThe talks with the Justice Department add another possible complication to already contentious negotiations with state and local governments, which are collectively seeking to recover billions of dollars from Purdue and other drugmakers and distributors. Whether Purdue and the Sacklers can come up with enough money to appease the myriad governmental factions is for now an open question.\n\nAny deal with the Justice Department, which would likely include a monetary fine, could further dilute the share of money available to settle suits brought by states and local governments. It is unclear how big any potential federal government fines would be.\n\nPurdue and Sackler family members have been negotiating a multibillion-dollar deal with states, cities and counties that allege the drugmaker\u2019s aggressive marketing of OxyContin helped fuel an opioid epidemic. Purdue has denied the allegations.\n\nThe current proposal to resolve some 2,000 of those cases would include $3 billion from the Sacklers and an additional $1.5 billion in family money contingent on the sale of its international operations, the Journal has reported. The proposal, valued by the company at between $10 billion and $12 billion, would be implemented through a bankruptcy and include donated drugs to treat opioid addiction and ongoing revenue from OxyContin sales.\n\nSome states, including New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, have balked at the proposed settlement, saying it doesn\u2019t bring in enough money. States and other plaintiffs have pushed the Sacklers to guarantee $4.5 billion upfront but have been rebuffed by the family, people familiar with the request said.\n\nThe company has said in relation to the civil lawsuits that it believes a settlement now \u201cis a far better path than years of wasteful litigation and appeals.\u201d The company said it is actively working with state attorneys general and other plaintiffs on a resolution that could save lives and \u201cdeliver billions of dollars to the communities affected by the opioid abuse crisis.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Should a deal with the Justice Department come at the expense of settlements with state and local governments? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nPurdue said in October 2017 it was cooperating with an investigation by the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut, its home state.\n\nThe Justice Department has penalized Purdue before. After a federal investigation, the company and three of its executives in 2007 pleaded guilty to criminal charges of misleading the public about the addiction risk of OxyContin and paid $634.5 million in government penalties and costs.\n\nA new round of legal issues began for the Stamford, Conn.-based company a decade later, when state attorneys general started suing Purdue in actions claiming its aggressive marketing of OxyContin helped hook residents on opioids and cause widespread addiction. Local governments, Native American tribes, hospitals and others have since brought some 2,500 lawsuits of their own against Purdue.\n\nThe company has been preparing to file for bankruptcy as a tool to resolve the legal liabilities, but is still trying to reach deals ahead of time to ensure a smoother trip through bankruptcy court.\n\nA bellwether trial slated for October in the case of two Ohio counties is putting time pressure on the talks.\n\n\u2014Jared S.
