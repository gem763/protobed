Buckley Jr. in New York City in 1965. (AP)\n\nThe way William F. Buckley Jr. remembered it later, he never had a chance.\n\nWithin weeks of losing a formal debate against writer and civil rights activist James Baldwin, Buckley said that no matter what he had done, it would have been impossible for him to win that night. The student audience at the Cambridge Union was \u201can orgy of anti-Americanism,\u201d he said, who gave Baldwin \u201ca standing ovation\u201d before \u201che had uttered a single word.\u201d\n\nBut that isn\u2019t what happened. The students were mostly British conservatives, and they gave Baldwin the same polite applause, with no standing, before his speech that they gave Buckley. We know this because the debate was recorded and broadcast repeatedly in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1965, and now has an everlasting life on YouTube, where it has received more than a million views.\n\nThe debate is the subject of a new book by political scientist Nicholas Buccola, \u201cThe Fire Is Upon Us: James Baldwin, William F. Buckley Jr., and the Debate over Race in America.\u201d\n\nBuccola takes a different view of why Buckley lost that night in February 1965.\n\nBuckley \u201cnever really took Baldwin seriously as an intellectual adversary,\u201d Buccola said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cHe just sort of treated him as a threat to what he believed in, and he distorted Baldwin\u2019s views to try to advance his agenda.\u201d\n\nSparring partners\n\nBaldwin and Buckley were almost too perfect as sparring partners. They were about the same age and grew up in large families less than 100 miles from one another \u2014 Baldwin in the \u201cghetto\u201d of New York\u2019s Harlem neighborhood and Buckley in a mansion with dozens of rooms in Sharon, Ct. Both hit success as writers in their 20s and were regarded as the most erudite thinkers in their respective milieus.\n\nBy 1965, Buckley was the editor in chief of the conservative magazine he had founded, National Review. And Baldwin was a highly praised writer of novels, plays and essays with a new book, \u201cAnother Country,\u201d soon to be released in paperback in the U.K. He was at the height of his stardom.\n\nBut that January, Baldwin was also recovering from a serious viral infection in the South of France. As a U.K. book tour was being planned for the next month, his agent warned the publisher\u2019s press guy not to plan too much, for the already slight man was still weak.\n\nThe publicist ignored him, Buccola wrote, filling nearly every minute of the tour with events. And he had a very big idea \u2014 a debate at the famed Cambridge Union. Malcolm X had spoken there weeks before to much ado, and the publicist hoped to repeat that success.\n\n[Martin Luther King Jr. met Malcolm X just once. The photo still haunts us with what was lost.]\n\nThe student organizers set about finding a worthy speaker to challenge Baldwin, and began inviting segregationist senators. All turned them down.\n\nThen they asked Buckley, who was conveniently already in Europe. His wife had broken her leg in a skiing accident, and Buckley was tending to her bedside in Switzerland. But, perhaps tempted by the prospect of exercising his college-debate skills, he decided he could leave her briefly for an evening of argument.\n\nA week before the debate, Baldwin\u2019s agent caught wind of the idea and sent a blunt cable to the publicist: \u201cHave advised Baldwin strongly against participating in debate with Buckley. Please cancel it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why or how, Buccola wrote, but that order was ignored, and the show simply went on.\n\n\u2018I built the railroads\u2019\n\nBaldwin arrived in London on Feb. 16 and dined that night with the student organizers, who explained to him the rules of formal debate. First, two students would speak briefly for and against the motion, and then Baldwin would give a lengthier argument, followed by Buckley\u2019s rebuttal. Students in the audience could rise to ask a question at any time. At the end, they would vote for or against the motion.\n\nThe student organizers had also come up with the motion, a provocative one they thought represented a theme in Baldwin\u2019s work: \u201cThe American dream is at the expense of the American Negro.\u201d\n\nTwo nights later, the union hall was packed as tightly as a fire marshal\u2019s worst nightmare. Students crammed onto the benches, sat on the stairs, and even tucked themselves around the lecterns from which the men would argue their cases.\n\nWhen Baldwin rose to speak, he pulled out his notes and tensely sipped a glass of water.\n\nFirst, he dispatched with the notion that the American Dream was available to African Americans. He described what it was like to be a black child in the \u201cglittering republic,\u201d and since every face of success and happiness you see is white, you assume you are white, too.\n\n\u201cIt comes as a great shock around the age of 5 or 6 or 7 to discover the flag to which you have pledged allegiance, along with everybody else, has not pledged allegiance to you.\u201d\n\nHe described the painful demoralization black citizens feel \u201cby the time you are 30,\u2033 when they realize that not only could they not escape the trap of white supremacy, but that their children wouldn\u2019t be able to, either.\n\n[I devoured James Baldwin\u2019s \u2018If Beale Street Could Talk\u2019 when I was 13. It changed my life.]\n\nThen, he said, he must turn to this notion of \u201cexpense.\u201d \u201cThe harbors and the ports and the railroads of the country,\u201d especially the South, could not have been built, he said, without \u201ccheap labor.\u201d\n\nAnd here, he changed to first person, an odd but effective choice, looked out at the young audience and boomed:\n\n\u201cI am stating very seriously, and this is not an overstatement, I picked the cotton, and I carried it to market, and I built the railroads, under someone else\u2019s whip, for nothing. For nothing.\u201d\n\nBaldwin spoke for 24 minutes. He wasn\u2019t interrupted by a student\u2019s question a single time; to do so \u201cwould have been profane,\u201d Buccola said. When he finished, the crowd applauded politely before bursting into an extended standing ovation.\n\nWhen Buckley rose, he appeared far more comfortable than Baldwin, and moved around speaking with ease. But what he had to say was quite a shock.\n\nHe suggested to the students that they had just showered Baldwin with praise not because he was eloquent and persuasive, but because he was black.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible, in my judgment, to deal with the indictment of Mr. Baldwin unless one is prepared to deal with him as a white man,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that in Baldwin\u2019s classic \u201cThe Fire Next Time,\u201d Baldwin \u201cthreatens America\u201d with destruction it didn\u2019t bend to his desires fast enough.\n\nAnd, he said, Baldwin \u201cdidn\u2019t, in writing that book, speak with the British accents that he used exclusively tonight.\u201d\n\nThe audience was appalled at the perceived accusation, laughing derisively and calling out \u201cShame!\u201d Baldwin himself responded like this:\n\n\n\nJames Baldwin reacts to William F. Buckley Jr. saying Baldwin spoke with \"British accents.\" (Cambridge Union)\n\nHaving read much of Buckley\u2019s writing at the time, Buccola said he thinks the crowd misunderstood Buckley\u2019s meaning. Buckley was not accusing Baldwin of affecting the queen\u2019s English, but rather of moderating for the elite audience what he perceived as Baldwin\u2019s \u201ctrue radical colors.\u201d\n\nBut that notion, too, was based on a \u201cmisread\u201d of \u201cThe Fire Next Time,\u201d Buccola said. Buckley seemed to think that Baldwin was \u201chellbent on overthrowing Western civilization,\u201d instead of warning that a conflagration would be the inevitable conclusion of a society that abused a portion of its citizens.\n\nIt didn\u2019t get much better for Buckley after that. Buckley said he felt \u201ccompassion\u201d for injustices visited upon Baldwin but that the solution wasn\u2019t the overthrow of civilization, which, again, Baldwin had not suggested. He suggested at least part of the problem was that African Americans lacked \u201cthat particular energy\u201d to uplift themselves like the Jews, Italians and Irish had. He took several questions and gave witty responses, but he also meandered and had trouble sticking to the motion he had come to rebut.\n\nIn the end, when the students voted, Baldwin carried the evening, 544 to 164.\n\nThree days later, after a wildly successful book tour, Baldwin celebrated with his sister at a fancy restaurant in London. He was interrupted mid-meal with the news that Malcolm X had been assassinated.\n\n[Malcolm X didn\u2019t fear being killed: \u2018I live like a man who is dead already\u2019]\n\n\n\nFollowers tend to Malcolm X as he lies mortally wounded on the stage of the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem after being shot on Feb. 21, 1965. (WCBS-TV/AP)\n\nThe response back home\n\nThe New York Times carried an item on the \u201cwild applause\u201d for Baldwin the next day. And, a few weeks later, it reprinted both men\u2019s speeches nearly in full. It was March 7, 1965, the same day an Alabama sheriff attacked peaceful protesters in Selma, Ala., in what became known as \u201cBloody Sunday.\u201d\n\nTalk of a stateside rematch started almost immediately, and the moment came that summer, when Baldwin and Buckley appeared on the talk show \u201cOpen End.\u201d Baldwin\u2019s agent again warned him against it, and this time the advice proved prescient. Without formal rules providing the space to build an argument, Baldwin withered under Buckley\u2019s fast and accusatory delivery, Buccola wrote, at times appearing almost too shocked to respond. That\u2019s according to what critics wrote about it, anyway \u2014 neither a tape nor transcript of the program still exists.\n\nSoon afterward, the broadcast of the Cambridge debate made it stateside, airing repeatedly on several networks.\n\nLittle is known of what Baldwin thought about the legendary debate. He doesn\u2019t seem to have talked about it publicly, and his personal letters, which are at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, are not available publicly until 2037. But when that day comes, Buccola told The Post, he expects to find \u201ca juicy letter\u201d all about it.\n\nBuckley told and retold the story of the Cambridge debate, with his inaccurate additions, throughout his life, even once calling it \u201cthe most satisfying debate I ever had.\u201d But over the years, his opinion of the civil rights movement moved closer to Baldwin\u2019s. By the 1980s, he was advocating for the creation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and in 2004 he told Time magazine: \u201cI once believed we could evolve our way up from Jim Crow. I was wrong. Federal intervention was necessary.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story said Buckley\u2019s house had more than 100 rooms, based on a galley version of Buccola\u2019s book.
