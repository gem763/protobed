Environmental groups are offering a 30,000-euro ($39,000 Cdn) reward for information about her disappearance.\n\nGuest host Nil Koksal spoke to Koen Van Muylem, of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest in Brussels, for the latest news about Naya.\n\nIn January, 2018 Naya became the first wolf seen in Belgium in 100 years. But she hasn't been spotted since May \u2014 and now there are fears she has been killed by hunters. Koen Van Muylem of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest in Brussels explains her disappearance to As It Happens guest host Nil K\u00f6ksal. 5:50\n\nOriginal story runs below.\n\nStory transcript\n\nAfter traveling hundreds of kilometres across parts of Europe, Naya has become the first recorded wolf to enter Belgium in at least a century.\n\n\"She spent a few weeks in the Netherlands during Christmas and New Years. And then \u2026 she passed over into Belgium,\" Hugh Jansman, an ecologist and researcher with Wageningen University in the Netherlands told As It Happens host Carol Off. He has been following Naya's trek.\n\nNaya was trapped by Norman Stier from the Technical University of Dresden when she was six months old and given a tracking collar. At the time, she was living with her parental pack in Germany.\n\nHugh Jansman is an ecologist in the Netherlands who has been following Naya's journey. (WUR )\n\nBut last October, she set off on her own. Now, Naya has made her home in a large military area near the town of Leopoldsburg in Belgium.\n\n'Recolonizing former habitats'\n\nThe arrival of Naya in Belgium is part of a resurgence of wolves in parts of Europe, explains Jansman.\n\nWolves disappeared from most of Western Europe starting in the beginning of the 20th century, but have been resurfacing. Last May, researchers reported that the first pack of wolves in 200 years had settled in Denmark.\n\nThis is in large part due to the \"rewilding\" campaign and the 1979 Berne Convention, which considered the wolf a strictly protected species and a \"fundamental elements of our natural European heritage.\"\n\n\"We are in the front of the wave of wolves recolonizing former habitats,\" said Jansman.\n\nBut not everyone is impressed by Naya's arrival.\n\n\"The emotions regarding the wolves are quite mixed,\" said Jansman.\n\nLast week, two sheep were killed and one injured in the Belgian municipality of Meerhout. The incident matches the location and timing of Naya's travels and this has farmers worried that their animals are at risk.\n\nA young male wolf looks out as it explores its new enclosure at The Wild Place Project on March 13, 2014 in Bristol, England. Jansman says he expects Naya to be a mother in the next year, which means the number of wolves in Belgium will be on the rise for the first time in more than 100 years.

If DNA tests show that sheep were in fact killed by a wolf, the farmers will be compensated by the government. Killing a wolf is not an option unless it is considered a larger risk to the public and cattle.\n\nNaya has been tracked in Belgium, and Jansman said since the report of her appearance became public people have been calling to say they may have seen her. Researchers are now corroborating those reports with her tracker history.\n\nLooking for a mate\n\nJansman said it is common for wolves to leave their parental pack in search of their own territory where they can find a mate, and that is likely what Naya is doing as she reaches sexual maturity.\n\nIt's unclear if she will find a mate in Belgium though, considering she is the first known wolf to be in the area in at least a century.\n\n\"It's a big mystery. We have no idea how many more wolves are traveling through our country. They can be quite elusive,\" Jansman said.\n\nStarting a family\n\nFor now, Jansman is hopeful that wolf pups will be in Naya's near future.\n\n\"She has surprised me a lot surviving so much danger on her trip,\" Jansman said.\n\n\"If a mate manages to find her, she has a perfect spot. And then there is a very big chance she will be a mother in a year.\"", "description": "Ecologist Hugh Jansman tells As It Happens about Naya the wolf's journey across parts of Europe.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4502452.1549487330!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wolf-hunt.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-24"}
