As we\u2019ve discussed here on multiple occasions, those videos the Navy released of UAPs (unidentified aerial (or aerospace) phenomenon\u2026 basically the new phrase for UFOs) have created quite a stir and led to an extended discussion in the mainstream media. The one group we haven\u2019t heard much from, however, is the Navy. It\u2019s true that a number of the pilots involved have given interviews, which is great, but the Navy hasn\u2019t taken any official position on what we\u2019re seeing in those videos and what the pilots encountered.\n\nThat is, not until now. Through diligent work using the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), one researcher got the Navy to respond. And they do indeed consider these craft to be \u201cunidentified.\u201d (Vice)\n\nIn official statements, the US Navy has for the first time officially stated that the three UFO videos made public by former Blink-182 singer Tom DeLonge\u2019s UFO research organization are footage of real \u201cunknown\u201d objects violating American airspace. Navy spokesperson Joseph Gradisher told Motherboard that \u201cthe Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those 3 videos as unidentified.\u201d Previously, the Navy never addressed the content of the videos. The terminology here is important: The UFO community is increasingly using the terminology \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d to discuss unknown objects in the sky. John Greenwald, author and curator of The Black Vault, the largest civilian archive of declassified government documents, originally reported the news.\n\nI\u2019m familiar with the guy who broke this story because he\u2019s been working in the field for many years and does quite a few interviews. John Greenwald runs the website The Black Vault. It\u2019s a project he started long ago and serves as a repository for all of the documents he\u2019s been able to squeeze out of the government on obscure topics via FOIA requests. He makes it available to the public at no cost and it\u2019s searchable if you\u2019re curious about any of this.\n\nThe real news came from a single line in the response he received when he requested information on investigations into the craft shown in those videos. It reads, \u201cThe Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those 3 videos as unidentified.\u201d\n\nUp until now, the Navy had remained mum. If they had any suspicions about who was behind these crafts, be it the Russians, the Chinese or something of ours out of Skunkworks, they weren\u2019t saying. This is the first time they\u2019ve directly admitted that they simply don\u2019t have any idea. The objects are true UAPs. Personally, I don\u2019t know if that makes me feel better or worse.\n\nOne other item of interest is the way that these revelations have begun creating movement in Congress. Republican Congressman Mark Walker of North Carolina wrote a letter to the Navy last month requesting more answers on this subject. He\u2019s looking to find out what sort of threat these things might be to our pilots and ships, as well as wanting to know if we have any physical evidence or \u201cexotic materials\u201d from them.\n\nThe Navy hasn\u2019t answered yet, but it will be enlightening when they do. Or perhaps I should say if they do.", "description": "And they were flying.
