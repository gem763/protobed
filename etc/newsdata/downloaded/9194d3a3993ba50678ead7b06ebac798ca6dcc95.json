It simply doesn't have the expertise or resources to do it all itself, and it's a policy which US politicians have supported.\n\nBut recently it has been accused of becoming too close to the aerospace giant, and failing to exercise proper oversight.\n\nThis report bears out a least part of that claim.\n\nIt concludes that the FAA wasn't sufficiently aware of what MCAS was and so was unable to exercise proper oversight; and that \"undue pressures\" were placed on Boeing staff carrying out tasks on behalf of the regulator.\n\nFAA Administrator Steve Dickson has said he will review every recommendation made in the \"unvarnished\" review.\n\nBut the problem remains: if certification depends on Boeing marking its own homework, how can the FAA be sure it's doing the job properly?\n\n'Undue pressures'\n\nIn a report published on Friday, the panel found that the the agency's \"limited involvement\" and \"inadequate awareness\" of the automated MCAS safety system \"resulted in an inability of the FAA to provide an independent assessment\".\n\nIt also found that Boeing staff performing the certification were also subject to \"undue pressures... which further erodes the level of assurance in this system of delegation\".\n\nWhile the FAA's approval process scrutinised individual changes, it did not adequately consider how the changes might interact with existing systems or with pilots and crew, the report added.\n\nThe panel included representatives from the FAA, as well as officials from NASA and nine other countries, including Canada, China and Indonesia.\n\n'Bolster aviation safety'\n\nThe FAA pledged it would act on the report's recommendations.\n\n\"We welcome this scrutiny and are confident that our openness to these efforts will further bolster aviation safety worldwide,\" FAA Chair Steve Dickson said. \"The accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia are a sombre reminder that the FAA and our international regulatory partners must strive to constantly strengthen aviation safety.\"\n\nBoeing, which has blamed the crashes on erroneous data fed into the system, called safety a \"core value\". It has said it is revising the plane's software to improve safeguards.\n\n\"Boeing is committed to working with the FAA in reviewing the recommendations and helping to continuously improve the process and approach used to validate and certify airplanes going forward,\" the company said in a statement.", "description": "A panel has sharply criticised the FAA and Boeing over certification of the company's 737 Max.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A059/production/_106994014_flight2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
