Here's what's scaring investors away - and what it means for the future.", "language": "en", "text": "Reason #1: Weak margins Michael Kovac/Getty Images for WeWork This year's IPO class is the least profitable since the tech bubble, with less than a quarter of the newly tradable companies set to reach positive net income by 2020. Many of this year's unicorns - and their disruptive \"platform\" models - are struggling to reach levels of profitability sought by public investors, and its sending their stock prices to the floor. The growing focus on software-based businesses has led many firms to classify themselves as software companies, but \"that narrative is now falling apart\" as investors demand software-company margins, venture capitalist Fred Wilson wrote in a Sunday blog post. Some software unicorns have maintained their IPO prices through the year, with Cloudflare and Zoom Video both trading above their offer level. Wilson notes that the two companies have gross margins of 81% and 77%, respectively, above the 75% standard for software companies. On the other hand, some of the year's biggest IPO flops tout themselves as software companies but lack the margins to match. Here's where those public-market duds last reported gross margins: Uber: 46%\n\nLyft: 39%\n\nPeloton: 42%\n\nWeWork: roughly 20% (S-1 filing used a slightly different metric) \"If the product is something else and cannot produce software gross margins then it needs to be valued like other similar businesses with similar margins, but maybe at some premium to recognize the leverage it can get through software,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nReason #2: The macro landscape Yuri Gripas/Reuters Though recession fears have calmed from their late-August highs, plenty of factors continue to drive market volatility and keep investors on their toes. A recent Preqin survey covering the second half of 2019 found 74% of investors viewing the market at the peak of its cycle, implying a downtrend is just around the corner. Meanwhile, major stock indexes have remained near record highs despite significant outflows from equity markets, with investors moving capital to less volatile investments. The latest warning signs hint at an upcoming economic slowdown, and it may be scaring investors away from volatile IPOs. Stocks are among the riskiest assets to hold in a downturn, and newly public companies typically see more price swings than average as investors pile in to make their first bets. While margins and marketing are crucial for investors looking to back a unicorn, macroeconomic conditions could keep investment away from equities as a whole.\n\nReason #3: Branding Peloton The move from private to public ownership has become increasingly rocky, as investors are expecting more from unicorns and aren't as easily swayed by lofty marketing techniques. WeWork's IPO filing noted its goal was to \"to elevate the world's consciousness.\" Peloton \"sells happiness\" according to its S-1 filing, before adding, \"but of course, we do so much more.\" Lyft \"is at the forefront of a massive societal change.\" IPO documents tend to lean toward the dramatic and appeal to investors with ambitious language. However, many of the unicorns pitching themselves as disruptive to the status quo don't possess the business models to reliably grow profits. \"When it comes to 'platform' companies, venture capital has done a generally terrible job building these businesses into viable companies,\" DataTrek researcher Nicholas Colas wrote in a September 27 note. Public investors \"need vibrant, growing platform companies to create long-term value,\" he added, and \"the focus on price momentum over fundamentals\" that worked in private funding doesn't attract public capital as easily.", "description": "Many of the startups that have tested the initial    public offering market in 2019 have floundered amid a    disconnect between private valuation and publi...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/apple-touch-icon.png"}
