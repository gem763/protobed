Ann Wagner (R-MO) about news that \u201cscores of stable partners\u201d have fled the project, Zuckerberg conceded that the waters were choppy. As of this month, PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, and EBay have all dropped their involvement in Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency ambitions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risky project and there\u2019s been a lot of scrutiny,\u201d Zuckerberg admitted.\n\n\u201cI believe that it\u2019s important to try new things, as long as you do so responsibly,\u201d he said, defending Facebook\u2019s decision to press on in spite of setbacks.\n\nWith cameos on the Hill from Facebook\u2019s chief executive relatively rare, the hearing skipped from topic to topic, rarely with a coherent throughline. In one low point, Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) condemned Facebook for its bias against anti-vaccine content, demanding the Facebook founder answer the question \u201cAre you 100% confidence that vaccines pose no injury to anyone on this planet?\u201d\n\nAfter Zuckerberg defended the scientific consensus around the issue, Posey attacked the platform\u2019s policy as silencing beliefs that its chief executive doesn\u2019t agree with.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the statistics, I think you\u2019re making a bad mistake,\u201d Posey said.\n\nIn his opening statements, Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook has faced a series of setbacks in recent years and that those scandals may hinder its efforts to launch its proposed cryptocurrency Libra, a \u201cstablecoin\u201d with a value tied to and backed by traditional currency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward,\u201d he said. To assuage the concerns, he repeated the assertion that Facebook and the cryptocurrency\u2019s governing group, the Libra Association, would not launch Libra until regulators were satisfied.\n\nHe pitched Libra as \u201cpromoting financial inclusion through a safe, low-cost, and efficient way of sending and receiving payments around the world,\u201d a technological solution to limited access to bank accounts, one that is \u201cnot an attempt to create a sovereign currency,\u201d that is, would not compete with the U.S. dollar.\n\nHe argued that if the United States didn\u2019t lead the way in creating a digital currency, others\u2014particularly China\u2014would: \u201cIf America doesn\u2019t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed\u2026 There\u2019s no guarantee that services which support democracy and fundamental rights around expression will win out.\u201d\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have shown a strong distaste for Libra, including the committee\u2019s chairwoman Maxine Waters. Democratic lawmakers denounced Facebook\u2019s \u201cbreathtaking amount of arrogance\u201d at a hearing in July, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has expressed concern that terrorists will use Libra to fund illegal and dangerous activities.", "description": "During his second big appearance before Congress, Zuckerberg fielded questions on everything from redlining to anti-vaxxers.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Blake Montgomery", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571842104/GettyImages-1177739924_1_jd0lhg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
