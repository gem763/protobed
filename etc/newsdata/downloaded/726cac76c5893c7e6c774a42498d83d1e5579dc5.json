REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte\n\nChina and Sri Lanka\u2019s already strained relations took a further blow on Monday when President Maithripala Sirisena alleged corruption at a Chinese company contracted to build the Lotus Tower, South Asia\u2019s tallest tower. A Sri Lankan parliamentary panel said it would investigate.\n\nNeither the company nor the Chinese embassy in Colombo has commented on Sirisena\u2019s allegations. China has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in its multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cNow China is looking at us differently. When Gotabaya Rajapaksa becomes the president... he will set the record right and restore the relationship to where it was,\u201d Rajapaksa\u2019s adviser Palitha Kohona told reporters in Colombo.\n\n\u201cI suppose the thinking was if we upset China, the West would come to us with endless bags of gold... But the bags of gold never materialized,\u201d Kohona said.\n\nTies between Colombo and Beijing soured when, upon his election in 2015, Sirisena suspended all Chinese investment projects, citing allegations of corruption, overpricing and flouting of government procedures. He allowed projects to resume the following year after demanding changes in some.\n\nRajapaksa\u2019s spokesman said on Friday that the opposition politician, whose candidature has yet to be confirmed, and his brother, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, met this week with Chen Min\u2019er, a leader of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and a close ally of President Xi Jinping, to discuss future ties.\n\nSpokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said that at the meeting Chen pledged China\u2019s support for the Sri Lankan government\u2019s future endeavours.\n\nRajapaksa is widely seen as the frontrunner in November\u2019s election due to his popularity among Sri Lanka\u2019s Sinhala Buddhist majority for his role in ending a 26-year civil war in 2009.\n\nHowever, his candidature is yet to be confirmed, with uncertainties lingering over a legal battle related to misappropriation of funds and his renunciation of U.S. citizenship. Sri Lanka does not allow dual citizens to contest elections.\n\nRajapaksa has denied wrongdoing and says he has already renounced his citizenship.", "description": "Sri Lankan presidential nominee Gotabaya Rajapaksa would \"restore relations\" with the country's top lender China if he wins the Nov. 16 vote and met with a senior Chinese official this week, according to an adviser and his spokesman.", "authors": ["Shihar Aneez", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431737715&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1X7", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
