Trump, meanwhile, is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House over his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nBut both Trump and Warren contend an overly strong dollar hurts U.S. competitiveness.\n\nRead: Survey of investors shows growing anxiety over Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rise in presidential polls\n\nTrump has made his displeasure with the dollar\u2019s persistent strength relative to other major currencies clear on Twitter and elsewhere, even prompting fears of a return to unilateral intervention in currency markets, despite assurances by White House officials that such actions were off the table. Warren, in outlining what she calls her \u201cplan for economic patriotism\u201d, wrote that the U.S. government \u201cshould consider a number of tools and work with other countries harmed by currency misalignment to produce a currency value that\u2019s better for our workers and our industries.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Bank\n\nThe U.S. dollar remains near its highs for the year on a trade-weighted bases, while the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.01%, a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, hit a more-than-two-year high earlier this month and has rallied around 3% so far this year.\n\nA strong dollar can be a headwind for U.S. companies doing business overseas. The S&P SPX, +1.04%, however, has rallied around 16% so far in 2019 but is up around just 2.3% from its level a year ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.81% is up around 13% in the year to date and up around 1.3% over the past 12 months.\n\nSee: Why a \u2018Teflon\u2019-coated U.S. dollar refuses to lose its luster\n\nAnd read: Why the U.S. dollar is cementing its role as a global safe haven\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar\u2019s resilience in the face of efforts by the Trump administration to talk it down could be inviting complacency, Ruskin said.\n\nBut he warned that investors and traders shouldn\u2019t play down the potential for either Trump or Warren to succeed in achieving a weaker U.S. dollar once the dust clears in 2020, when such efforts would probably \u201chave the capacity to be far more effective than we have seen in the Trump presidency so far.\u201d\n\nIn the note, Ruskin offers a detailed breakdown of six factors that will determine the dollar\u2019s vulnerability after 2020. Here\u2019s his summary:\n\n\u2022 Verbal FX intervention \u2013 it will be more effective to shout as U.S. rates come down and \u2018the door\u2019 opens to USD weakness; \u2022 Fed appointees. Orthodox \u2018doves\u2019 should send in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Hawks should not apply! \u2022 The stance on trade & China \u2013 no tariffs by tweet, but a tough line on access to U.S. markets from Warren. Less incentive for a Trump second term to cut a hasty deal with China. No overarching deal in the next year does not bode well for any quick improvement thereafter. \u2022 Fiscal policies \u2013 do Warren\u2019s numbers add up any better than the Trump tax reform? If they don\u2019t, there is a hidden stimulus there that will likely play USD positive in the [short term], acting as an offset to other USD negatives. \u2022 The relative attractiveness of U.S. asset markets, given prevailing concerns about increased regulations, and the resultant [short-term] disruption to key sectors under Warren that will encourage Fed easing and a weaker USD. \u2022 The makeup of Congress. Can either Trump or Warren lead a landslide win in the House and Senate? Without Congressional support, Warren will not be able to enact the most USD negative actions related to regulation/trade, or the most positive aspects like any (hidden) fiscal stimulus.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the USD, \u2018economic patriotism\u2019 and \u2018America First\u2019 have considerable overlap,\u201d Ruskin wrote. \u201cMost obvious is the desire to avoid an overly strong USD, and as long as fiscal policies do not temporarily reverse the push to U.S. short-term rate convergence with the rest of the developed world, Warren or Trump will each have an easier time tapping down on an already weaker USD.\u201d", "description": "President Trump doesn\u2019t care for a strong dollar \u2014 but neither does Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren.
