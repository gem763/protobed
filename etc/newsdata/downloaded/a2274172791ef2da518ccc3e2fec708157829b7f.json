Suddenly, the prospect of another first round exit stares down the Washington Nationals, with the herculean task of overtaking the back-to-back National League champions awaiting.\n\nDown two games to one and a loss away from elimination, the good news for the Nationals is that they get to throw their ace.\n\nMax Scherzer will toe the rubber Monday in a must-win Game 4 at Nationals Park. Facing a formidable Dodgers lineup that scored 10 runs in the final five innings of Game 3, the 35-year-old's charge will be to prolong the Nationals' season and give them a chance of capturing the franchise's first-ever postseason series victory.\n\n\"What I do know is that we got Mad Max on the mound tomorrow,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said after the 10-4 defeat, \"which I believe puts us in a great position.\"\n\nYANKEES: Severino's return puts Bombers on path to World Series\n\nNLDS: Braves stun Cardinals with ninth-inning comeback in Game 3\n\nThe righty started the thrilling wild-card game victory over the Milwaukee Brewers not a week ago. He struggled early, allowing three earned runs on a pair of homers in the first two frames, but settled in to complete five innings and hand the ball to fellow starter Stephen Strasburg, who would start a potential Game 5 back in Los Angeles.\n\nBefore that, though, Scherzer \u2013 who owns a 3.78 career ERA in the playoffs across 18 outings \u2013 must help ensure there is a flight back to the West Coast.\n\nLos Angeles got its first look of Scherzer this postseason when Martinez deployed him in the eighth inning of Game 2. Scherzer indulged his skipper by striking out the side, but he'll need to record more than three outs for the Nationals to have any chance of survival.\n\nMax Scherzer (31) looks on from the dugout during Game 3.

Scherzer, who missed nearly a month this summer with back injuries, doesn't anticipate that changing in Game 4 and attributes that to the heightened environment of the playoffs.\n\n\"For me, it\u2019s just a mentality of just going out there with everything on the line,\" Scherzer said Sunday. \"The atmospheres I\u2019ve pitched in, here with the wild-card game and then there on the road in Dodger Stadium, I mean, it\u2019s been intense.\n\n\"So you\u2019re going to get the best out of me. And there\u2019s no regular season environment that I can replicate that.\"\n\nMuch like the wild-card game, the Nationals' aspirations of moving on will rely on a successful handoff from Scherzer to Strasburg \u2013 except this time it will have to span two games.\n\nThe Nationals aren't jamming the panic button yet. But they realize escape from the brink starts with Scherzer on Monday.\n\n\"I think we're weirdly comfortable right now even with our backs against the wall,\" Nationals closer Sean Doolittle said. \"We got Max going (Monday), Stras going after him. We've played a lot of must-win games here in the last couple months of the season.\n\n\"We've had our backs against the wall before. Coming in here, looking at guys, talking to guys, nobody's panicking.\"", "description": "On the brink of elimination, the Washington Nationals turn to their ace Max Scherzer.
