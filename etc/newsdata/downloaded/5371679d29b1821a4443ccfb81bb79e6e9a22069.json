The effort to destroy the livelihoods of those who do not accept The Approved Groupthink has expanded outside of Hollywood all the way to Pittsburgh. Either oppose Donald Trump in 2020 or get run out of town on a rail, small business owners!\n\nTo quote Steely Dan, ironically \u2014 What a glorious time to be free:\n\nLocal social media is abuzz over efforts in Pittsburgh to identify and boycott businesses owned by supporters of President Donald Trump. \u201cI think it\u2019s important because people have a right to know where their money is going,\u201d Pittsburgh blogger Brian Broome told KDKA political editor Jon Delano on Tuesday. \u2026 \u201cIf there is a specific ideology that you don\u2019t support, you are well within your rights not to hand that money to someone who supports that ideology,\u201d says Broome. \u201cTrump supporters have boycotted everything from Keurig to Nike, so I don\u2019t know why, quote-unquote, the other side can\u2019t decide not to give their money to businesses as well.\u201d\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not just a boycott, even by the terms of the now-suspended Facebook post. The boycotts that Broome cites are a withholding of personal custom, aimed at large corporations. This effort takes aim at small businesses, and it\u2019s not to deprive the businesses of personal patronage. They want to chase these people out of business altogether:\n\nThe new website promises to include, \u201ca database of Trump-supporter owned businesses in the Pittsburgh area, as well as tips for how to get those specific businesses closed down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not a boycott. It\u2019s a manifesto for street action against political opponents, no matter what the cost. Too bad about all the lost jobs, I suppose, but ya gotta crack a few eggs to make a socially acceptable omelette, people.\n\nThe local Republican Party chair has a word for this, or actually a few of them. Fascist, absurd, dangerous \u2014 take your pick, although Sam DeMarco probably should have stopped at those:\n\n\u201cThey want to cost people their livelihoods just because you don\u2019t agree with them politically?\u201d asks Allegheny County councilman Sam DeMarco, who also chairs the county\u2019s Republican Party. \u201cIt\u2019s not just absurd, but I believe it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d \u2026 \u201cLook at what they\u2019re trying to do. People who they just don\u2019t agree with, they want to take and punish. I absolutely believe this is a fascist behavior, and I totally reject it,\u201d says the GOP chairman.\n\nDeMarco\u2019s parallel to the Nazis\u2019 labeling of Jewish-owned businesses is over the top. That was a government-based effort, made even more clear with the Nuremberg Laws that followed shortly thereafter. However, it\u2019s not anywhere near as benign as Broome would have it, either. This effort wants to destroy the livelihood of Americans over their political differences, rather than just having a debate over politics. That\u2019s dangerous in its own way without tripping over Godwin\u2019s Law to explain why.\n\nLet\u2019s give Hollywood conservative John O\u2019Hurley the last word in explaining this phenomenon. O\u2019Hurley is focused on Messing\u2019s \u201clunacy\u201d and its aim at purging Hollywood of conservative thought. \u201cIt underscores the fact that we aren\u2019t receptive to a diversity of thought, which is the exact opposite of what you feel the liberal way would be,\u201d O\u2019Hurley says, \u201cand I find that obscene.\u201d It\u2019s obscene in Pittsburgh, too.", "description": "\"I absolutely believe this is a fascist behavior.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kdka-boycott.png"}
