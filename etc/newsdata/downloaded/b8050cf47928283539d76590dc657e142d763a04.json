And It\u2019s Make-or-Break Time for His Campaign.", "language": "en", "text": "The senator and presidential candidate has made his return to the trail, buoyed by an endorsement by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What happens next? Photo: Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nBernie Sanders spent lots of time talking on the phone during his two weeks off the campaign trail post\u2013heart attack earlier this month. There were the uneventful well-wishing calls he and his wife Jane got from his rivals in the 2020 presidential race, and from some political allies. (Harry Reid, for one, visited in person while Sanders was still hospitalized in Las Vegas.) There were some more eventful ones, like the \u201cI\u2019m going to endorse you\u201d call he got from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, routed through his campaign manager Faiz Shakir. And, once it pretty quickly became clear to Sanders\u2019s aides in both Las Vegas and Washington that he would be able to resume campaigning, and that they should map out next steps, there were the reassurance calls.\n\nNo one, after all, knew what to expect from the 78-year-old, who had just suffered his first heart attack. At his campaign headquarters in D.C., for example, Sanders\u2019s staff gathered three times to hear formal updates while news trickled out from Nevada, then Vermont. Sanders himself called in once to speak with, and rally, the assembled operatives. They\u2019d just come through a long summer that included some undeniably rough patches, politically speaking, both internally and because of the rise of Elizabeth Warren. The campaign had remained mostly quiet in the early days of Sanders\u2019s hospitalization, holding off for days before confirming late on a Friday that he\u2019d suffered a heart attack. But its few informal public communications were starting to shape a message \u2014 the day Sanders was discharged and returned to Vermont, senior adviser Josh Orton tweeted a link to a video of \u201cWilly Wonka\u2019s Grand Entrance\u201d and titled it \u201cNEW footage of Bernie leaving the hospital.\u201d Sanders\u2019s top aides now wanted the full staff in on the plan: Sanders would remain at home, recovering, for two weeks until the next debate, but they were to push ahead as hard as ever. The voters needed reassuring, too.\n\nSo while Sanders met with his inner circle back in Burlington and began prepping in his backyard for the debate the same way he always did \u2014 a casual back-and-forth, not a formal mock session \u2014 his campaign began putting out new formal policy proposals (with Sanders weighing in over the phone). It resumed an Iowa television ad buy that it had temporarily suspended, and it advertised a wave of surrogate campaign events in early-voting states. With uncertainty about Sanders\u2019s health circulating, it announced he would participate in a march \u201cto end corporate greed\u201d in Des Moines next month, and it distributed a video Sanders filmed to thank supporters for their messages. He sat for a pair of TV interviews. His teams in the states pushed the \u201cfull steam ahead\u201d message, too: In Nevada, they said they\u2019d now attempted over one million voter contacts and rolled out a slate of new community leader and educator endorsements; in New Hampshire, they announced campaign co-chairs; and in South Carolina, they opened an office in Florence County.\n\nAnd they announced that on Saturday he\u2019d be holding a major rally at Queensbridge Park, titled \u201cBernie\u2019s Back.\u201d Before long, they started teasing that there\u2019d be a \u201cspecial guest\u201d there as well.\n\nStill, some nerves lingered in Burlington as the senior brass prepared for Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio. They knew Sanders would get a health question, but even if he was ready for that, this three-hour session would still be his return to the full-speed fray.\n\nYet by the time the candidate walked offstage and asked his aides how he did on Tuesday night, as he always does immediately after leaving debate stages, their mood had shifted considerably. Not only did Sanders exceed his skeptics\u2019 expectations, the public now knew about the endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow \u201cSquad\u201d member Ilhan Omar. (These endorsements were supposed to be rolled out later, but the news broke early.) The campaign\u2019s attention was already shifting to Saturday, when Ocasio-Cortez would join Sanders onstage for the first time this year, a moment that had been in the making since she\u2019d flown to Vermont late last month and sat with Bernie, Jane Sanders, Shakir, and one of her own aides for what Shakir called a meeting of \u201ctwo ideological compatriots who see each other, who understand one another.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s advisers describe this moment now as a triumphant return to the trail just in time for the campaign to get serious. \u201cNovember is exactly when we want to be going up, showing momentum,\u201d said Shakir, describing Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s presence onstage as \u201cthe kind of movement that shakes\u201d the hard-to-mobilize voters Sanders needs by his side. The senator\u2019s team is in talks with the congresswoman\u2019s about a trip to Iowa, too, Shakir said. Longtime Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said he expects the candidate to soon return to something like his typical breakneck campaign speed: \u201cObviously the health incident raised some immediate questions, and it was obviously important to demonstrate what was the case \u2014 which was he was on the road to recovery and will be campaigning vigorously.\u201d The political revolution, in this telling, is back on track.\n\nThe truth is that this is, indeed, an inflection point for Sanders, but a far more delicate one than he or his allies readily admit. In fact, how the candidate handles the next month could determine the rest of his trajectory in the race.\n\nSanders, who has yet to release promised medical information, and who has switched his primary campaign message from Medicare for All to electability and back multiple times, is reemerging just as more voters are watching the race more closely than ever, and just as Warren, the newly minted front-runner, faces centrist fire for the first time, and just as his campaign brain trust hopes his 2016 supporters come home to him.\n\nNotorious among his allies for his resistance to talk about his personal life, Sanders is hoping to move on from the health question. At earlier stages of his political career, he\u2019s bristled when asked about his health.\n\nIt was never a campaign issue in 2016, after Hillary Clinton ally David Brock floated the idea of calling for Sanders to release his medical records early in the primary, only to face a huge internal backlash. Still, Sanders liked making a point of taking it off the table. During that campaign, some of his early ads included shots of him running during his student days and playing baseball as an adult, and he enjoyed playing basketball in front of the cameras. In the lead-up to the 2020 race, he participated in multiple long marches \u2014 once, when a CNN anchor asked Weaver about Sanders\u2019s health following such a campaign event in Indiana, Weaver shot back that the reporter was struggling to keep up with the hearty Sanders. Sanders told New York that week, \u201cI thank God, you know, I can\u2019t remember the last day \u2014 honestly \u2014 when I missed work.\u201d He continued, \u201cWhat people have a right to know: Is the candidate healthy? Does he or she have the energy to do what is a very stressful and difficult job?\u201d On the debate stage this week, he pointed to his Saturday rally when asked about his heart.\n\nNow, though, he\u2019s tasked with moving past these questions just when he has to catch back up to Warren and eclipse Joe Biden. He lost ground over the summer, and entering the fall, he tossed out and rebuilt parts of his Iowa team and completely overhauled his operation in New Hampshire, a must-win state for him where he is now polling third.\n\nAnd while polling since his heart attack has been scant, the early indications haven\u2019t been good: The most recent national Quinnipiac poll showed Sanders\u2019s support dropping over the course of the previous week, including significant drops among non-college-educated white voters and very liberal voters \u2014 two groups he can ill afford to lose. Meanwhile, a HuffPost/YouGov survey had just 28 percent of Democrats assessing Sanders as being in adequate physical condition for four years of the presidency.\n\nThe imperative for a blockbuster return to the scene, then, is strategically obvious. It started with the debate, continued with the rollout of Omar\u2019s endorsement video the next morning, and will peak with Saturday\u2019s rally with Ocasio-Cortez, one of the party\u2019s biggest stars. Soon Sanders will appear with Rashida Tlaib, another \u201cSquad\u201d member, in Michigan, ahead of another expected endorsement.\n\nThe question, really, is what comes after that, once he returns to typical campaign events.\n\nSome of Sanders\u2019s close aides were delighted when the senator\u2019s first comments after his hospitalization were about the need to implement a Medicare for All system, and they expect him to lean back into that signature plan as the centerpiece of his campaign. \u201cWe will ratchet it up on Medicare for All,\u201d said longtime labor leader Larry Cohen, a veteran Sanders adviser who chairs the board of the Sanders-spawned Our Revolution outside group. Others see merit in a punchy tack that directly takes on Biden, specifically over the health-care question. Already, on Thursday, Sanders issued a statement decrying Biden\u2019s use of \u201cthe talking points of the insurance industry to attack Medicare for All,\u201d and a Friday fundraising email from the campaign echoed this line.\n\nWhat they all agree on now is that Sanders is intent on digging back in for the long haul, not transitioning to a new kind of campaign, as he\u2019d hinted, then walked back, in recent weeks. The Saturday rally isn\u2019t just about reenergizing his base and bringing in new voters, said Cohen. It\u2019s also a signal of a long slog ahead. That\u2019s because in his telling, it\u2019s a statement of intent about the New York primary.\n\nThat contest is likely to be the final opportunity for candidates who are still standing to pick up large numbers of delegates. And it\u2019s not for another six months.", "description": "The senator and presidential candidate has made his return to the trail after a heart attack, buoyed by an endorsement for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
