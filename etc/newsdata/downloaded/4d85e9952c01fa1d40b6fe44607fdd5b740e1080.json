His fundraising has dropped and some say he may be too moderate or too old to fight Donald Trump next year.\n\nSanders nearly took Iowa in 2016. Can the radical Democrat win it in 2020? Read more\n\nBut the former vice-president insisted on Saturday that some who back him think \u201cit\u2019s a general election, me versus Trump\u201d and claimed: \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want to face me.\u201d\n\nBiden spoke to the Associated Press before a town hall in Florence, South Carolina, the first southern state to vote.\n\nThe former Delaware senator leads the realclearpolitics.com national polling average by six points from Elizabeth Warren and maintains a healthy lead in South Carolina itself. But the Massachusetts senator has been surging elsewhere, leading in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t affect my strategy, period,\u201d Biden told the AP. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not being facetious. I think she\u2019s a fine person, a good candidate, but I didn\u2019t get involved in deciding to run because of polling or a particular strategy.\u201d\n\nIt is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted Kate Bedingfield\n\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s two things we know for certain. One, Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t want me to be president, according to Facebook taking down the Russian ads going after me. And two, surely Trump doesn\u2019t want to face me.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attempts to force Ukraine to investigate Biden are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBiden had said he would not accept support from super pacs, which can raise money for candidates but cannot co-ordinate with them.\n\nBut on Thursday his deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said that while he would still \u201cpush to remove private money from our federal elections \u2026 in this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Biden reported $15.2m raised in the third quarter. That put him fourth in the race, behind Vermont senator Bernie Sanders ($25.3m), Warren ($24.6m) and Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who raised $19.1m and has also surged in Iowa, attracting national headlines.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m told is, there are people out there who want to take these ads on, take him on now, because it\u2019s a general election, me versus Trump, in their minds right now. But I\u2019ve had no conversations with them.\u201d\n\n\u2018I took a stand\u2019: the centrist Democrat navigating impeachment in a divided district Read more\n\nIt has been reported that some donors, faced with Biden\u2019s stumbles and Warren\u2019s rise as a force for progressive policies, are looking to former New York mayor and media billionaire Michael Bloomberg as a late entrant in the ideological centre.\n\nBiden insisted he would do \u201cvery well\u201d in Iowa and New Hampshire but said losses wouldn\u2019t hurt him and South Carolina could \u201ccatapult\u201d him to success across the South.\n\nThe former vice-president is 76. Sanders is 78 and recently suffered a heart attack. Asked if age mattered, Biden said: \u201cRight now it\u2019s a legitimate question to ask\u2026 Right now, my age has brought with it a significant amount of experience in government and hopefully wisdom and some sound judgment.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would pledge to only serve one term, Biden said: \u201cI feel good and all I can say is, watch me, you\u2019ll see. It doesn\u2019t mean I would run a second term. I\u2019m not going to make that judgment at this moment.\u201d", "description": "Democratic candidate\u2019s lead drops in some polls as some say he\u2019s too moderate or too old to fight Trump next year", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcf2d0640e4ad32c3eb3df4793069bb54b88d3f3/0_165_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5fccbf55c54c1040bba52415b81e74d3", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
