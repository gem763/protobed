Rashida Tlaib \u2014 you can't beat Trump with T-shirts", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib sat down with the Detroit Free Press Editorial Board for a conversation about her first term. Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press\n\nFor only the fourth time in the nation's history, the U.S.House of Representatives has launched an inquiry that could lead to the expulsion of a sitting president.\n\nAnd now U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib has marked that solemn occasion with a merchandising campaign for her own line of T-shirts emblazoned with the message: \"Impeach the MF.\"\n\nIt's a prim contraction of the war cry with which the Democratic congresswoman from Detroit made headlines, embarrassed sympathetic colleagues, and secured her status as one of the incumbent president's favorite targets shortly after being sworn in last January.\n\n\"Lean in with me to hold this lawless President accountable,\" Tlaib, who represents Michigan's 13th Congressional District, implored in an appeal posted on Twitter.\n\n['Impeach the MF' T-shirts are justifiable \u2014 and so is Tlaib's anger, writes columnist Nancy Kaffer. Read her take here]\n\nLean in with me to hold this lawless President accountable. Together, we will fight back and protect our democracy.\n\n\n\nOur country depends on it!\n\n\n\n...and yes you can even wear what you feel https://t.co/8C3BUfp1kfpic.twitter.com/QwBADidAHo \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 26, 2019\n\nIt's exactly the sort of thing Donald Trump might do, if he were in Tlaib's position \u2014 and it diminishes her, and the seriousness of the task that awaits her and her colleagues, every bit as much as Trump has diminished his own office.\n\nSome context:\n\nI like Rashida Tlaib. I oversee an editorial board that endorsed her in her inaugural run for Congress. We have friendly disagreements about policy, and more frequent ones about tactics, but I have met very few lawmakers who work harder on behalf of their constituents than Tlaib does.\n\nI'm also a champion for class clowns, and for the healing power of comic relief. If it weren't for the Stephen Colberts of the world, my head might have exploded sometime in early 2017.\n\nMore: Rashida Tlaib likely to face challenger in 2020 \u2014 but beating her won't be easy\n\nMore: Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib talks about relentless attacks from president\n\nBut Tlaib is not a late-night comic. She's one of 435 people who may soon be asked to decide whether a president (who came to office via a constitutional process that has assured the peaceful transition of executive power for more than 200 years) should be expelled from office before his term expires.\n\nAnd now she's turned that weighty responsibility into a T-shirt line.\n\nIt's not funny, and it's another victory for a president who has won his own cheap applause by trivializing his office, mocking his political rivals, and demolishing any pretense of civility. Try as she might, Tlaib will never beat Donald Trump at the art of being small.\n\nBut like Trump, Tlaib risks little by playing to her friendliest audience. Her Detroit-based seat is as indelibly blue as any in Congress. I don't doubt her sincerity, but the fact is that colleagues like Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) and Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Troy and Rep. Justin Amash (I-Grand Rapids) have risked infinitely more in throwing their own support behind an impeachment inquiry.\n\nRep.

Dozier, Detroit Free Press)\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nLike many who championed her candidacy, I was embarrassed when Tlaib made national headlines with her first-day-of-school promise (\"We're going to impeach the mother----er!\") earlier this year.\n\nBut it was a rookie mistake. And while I had no illusions that it would frighten the exuberant Tlaib into apologetic public submission, I assumed she would emerge from the resulting firestorm with a keener appreciation of the way in which her exuberant style could undermine her substantive agenda.\n\nBut it turns out that Tlaib, a notoriously fast study when it comes to policy, is a slow learner when it comes to low politics. And she's using the wrong tutor.\n\nThis is no time for T-shirt slogans, and Tlaib does not serve her constituents well by appealing to their courser appetites. It's time to get out of Trump's sandbox and concentrate on rebuilding a government that offers its citizens something bigger than comic relief.\n\nBrian Dickerson is the Editorial Page Editor of the Free Press.
