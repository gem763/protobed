And I applaud her \"plottation\" of the royal situation. But please, don't try to garner sympathy from us. You knew what you were doing.'\n\nWendy went on to point out that if Markle and her husband were so distressed by the situation overseas they could just move to America.\n\n'Have a mansion in Malibu, a big hut... or a big hotel or wherever you're going to live in Africa, and have your royal palace-esque place in England,' opined Williams.\n\nThe talk show host did then make it clear that she had nothing against the couple.\n\n'I like them. I really do like them,' said Wendy.\n\n'But her - there's something about her.'\n\nWendy continued: 'You know what I'm saying? And you know what, girl, Meghan? Don't be surprised if the paparazzi are everywhere, you are royal.'\n\n'Meghan Markle, nobody feels sorry for you,' declared Wendy. 'You knew what you were signing up for, girl' (Markle and Prince Harry at their engagement photocall above)\n\nShe then went on to reveal that Markle (above in her recent ITV interview) even called up the show and asked to appear for free as a fashion expert\n\nThen, Wendy expanded upon a story she had told in the past about the time Markle asked to appear on the program.\n\nWendy explained to her audience that the press shy princess was once very much interested in the exposure that would be provided to her if she appeared on a few episodes of The Wendy Show.\n\nMarkle even went to the New York offices of the program during her pitch, but when the show called back to make the big offer they found the situation had suddenly changed for the Suits star.\n\nWendy asked for her producer to join the conversation at one point, who explained: 'So [Markle] wanted to be on the show, they chatted with her and they thought that she'd be perfect to come here and do it and then by the time we decided to book her...'\n\nThat is when the talk show host replied: 'She was already engaged.'\n\nShe then paused for a moment and added: 'So you get the picture.'", "description": "Wendy Williams made it clear that she had no patience, and even less sympathy, for Meghan Markle after the actress bemoaned the constant media coverage and photographers", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/20/20051978-0-image-a-36_1571772974892.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
