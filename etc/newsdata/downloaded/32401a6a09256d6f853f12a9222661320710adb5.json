More than 100 employers now use the system, including Hilton, Unilever and Goldman Sachs, and more than a million job-seekers have been analyzed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut some AI researchers argue the system is digital snake oil \u2014 an unfounded blend of superficial measurements and arbitrary number-crunching, unrooted in scientific fact. Analyzing a human being like this, they argue, could end up penalizing nonnative speakers, visibly nervous interviewees or anyone else who doesn\u2019t fit the model for look and speech.\n\nThe system, they argue, will assume a critical role in helping decide a person\u2019s career. But they doubt it even knows what it\u2019s looking for: Just what does the perfect employee look and sound like, anyway?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a profoundly disturbing development that we have proprietary technology that claims to differentiate between a productive worker and a worker who isn\u2019t fit, based on their facial movements, their tone of voice, their mannerisms,\u201d said Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute, a research center in New York.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pseudoscience. It\u2019s a license to discriminate,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the people whose lives and opportunities are literally being shaped by these systems don\u2019t have any chance to weigh in.\u201d\n\nLoren Larsen, HireVue\u2019s chief technology officer, argues that such criticism is uninformed and that \u201cmost AI researchers have a limited understanding\u201d of the psychology behind how workers think and behave.\n\nLarsen compared algorithms\u2019 ability to boost hiring outcomes with medicine\u2019s improvement of health outcomes and said that the science backed him up. The system, he argued, is still more objective than the flawed metrics used by human recruiters, whose thinking he called the \u201cultimate black box.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are rejected all the time based on how they look, their shoes, how they tucked in their shirts, and how \u2018hot\u2019 they are,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cAlgorithms eliminate most of that in a way that hasn\u2019t been possible before.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe AI, he said, doesn\u2019t explain its decisions or give candidates their assessment scores, which he called \u201cnot relevant.\u201d But it is \u201cnot logical,\u201d he said, to assume that some people might be unfairly eliminated by the automated judge.\n\n\u201cWhen 1,000 people apply for one job,\u201d he said, \u201c999 people are going to get rejected, whether a company uses AI or not.\u201d\n\nThe inscrutable algorithms have forced job-seekers to confront a new kind of interview anxiety. Nicolette Vartuli, a University of Connecticut senior studying math and economics with a 3.5 GPA, said she researched HireVue and did her best to dazzle the job-interview machine. She answered confidently and in the time allotted. She used positive keywords. She smiled, often and wide.\n\nAD\n\nBut when she didn\u2019t get the investment-banking job, she couldn\u2019t see how the computer had rated her or ask how she could improve, and she agonized over what she\u2019d missed. Had she not looked friendly enough? Did she talk too loudly? What did the AI hiring system believe she\u2019d gotten wrong?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI feel like that\u2019s maybe one of the reasons I didn\u2019t get it: I spoke a little too naturally,\u201d Vartuli said. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t use enough big, fancy words. I used \u2018conglomerate\u2019 one time.\u201d\n\nHireVue says its system dissects the tiniest details of candidates\u2019 responses \u2014 their facial expressions, their eye contact and perceived \u201centhusiasm\u201d \u2014 and compiles reports companies can use in deciding who to hire or disregard.\n\nAD\n\nJob candidates aren\u2019t told their score or what little things they got wrong, and they can\u2019t ask the machine what they could do better. Human hiring managers can use other factors, beyond the HireVue score, to decide which candidates pass the first-round test.\n\nThe system, HireVue says, employs superhuman precision and impartiality to zero in on an ideal employee, picking up on telltale clues a recruiter might miss.\n\nAD\n\nMajor employers with lots of high-volume, entry-level openings are increasingly turning to such automated systems to help find candidates, assess resumes and streamline hiring. The Silicon Valley start-up AllyO, for instance, advertises a \u201crecruiting automation bot\u201d that can text-message a candidate, \u201cAre you willing to relocate?\u201d And a HireVue competitor, the \u201cdigital recruiter\u201d VCV, offers a similar system for use in phone interviews, during which a candidate\u2019s voice and answers are analyzed by an \u201cautomated screening\u201d machine.\n\nAD\n\nBut HireVue\u2019s prospects have cemented it as the leading player in the brave new world of semi-automated corporate recruiting. It says it can save employers a fortune on in-person interviews and quickly cull applicants deemed subpar. HireVue says it also allows companies to see candidates from an expanded hiring pool: Anyone with a phone and Internet connection can apply.\n\nNathan Mondragon, HireVue\u2019s chief industrial-organizational psychologist, told The Post the standard 30-minute HireVue assessment includes half a dozen questions but can yield up to 500,000 data points, all of which become ingredients in the person\u2019s calculated score.\n\nAD\n\nThe employer decides the written questions, which HireVue\u2019s system then shows the candidate while recording and analyzing their response. The AI assesses how a person\u2019s face moves to determine, for instance, how excited someone seems about a certain work task, or how they\u2019d behave around angry customers. Those \u201cFacial Action Units,\u201d Mondragon said, can make up 29 percent of a person\u2019s score; the words they say and the \u201caudio features\u201d of their voice, like their tone, make up the rest.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHumans are inconsistent by nature. They inject their subjectivity into the evaluations,\u201d Mondragon said. \u201cBut AI can database what the human processes in an interview, without bias. \u2026 And humans are now believing in machine decisions over human feedback.\u201d\n\nTo train the system on what to look for and tailor the test to a specific job, the employer\u2019s current workers filling the same job \u2014 \u201cthe entire spectrum, from high to low achievers\u201d \u2014 sit through the AI assessment themselves, Larsen said.\n\nAD\n\nTheir responses, Larsen said, are then matched with a \u201cbenchmark of success\u201d from those workers\u2019 past job performance, like how well they\u2019d met their sales quotas or how quickly they\u2019d resolved customer calls. The best candidates, in other words, end up looking and sounding like the employees who\u2019d done well before the prospective hires had even applied.\n\nAD\n\nAfter a new candidate takes the HireVue test, the system generates a report card on their \u201ccompetencies and behaviors,\u201d including their \u201cwillingness to learn,\u201d \u201cconscientiousness & responsibility\u201d and \u201cpersonal stability,\u201d the latter of which is defined by how well they can cope with \u201cirritable customers or co-workers.\u201d\n\nThose computer-estimated personality traits are then used to group candidates into high, medium and low tiers based on their \u201clikelihood of success.\u201d Employers can still pursue candidates ranked in the bottom tier, but several interviewed by The Post said they mostly focused on the ones the computer system liked best.\n\nAD\n\nHireVue offers only the most limited peek into its interview algorithms, both to protect their trade secrets but also because the company doesn\u2019t always know how the system decides on who gets labeled a \u201cfuture top performer.\u201d\n\nThe company has given only vague explanations when defining which words or behaviors offer the best results. For a call-center job, the company says, \u201csupportive\u201d words might be encouraged, while \u201caggressive\u201d ones might sink one\u2019s score.\n\nHireVue said its board of expert advisers regularly reviews its algorithmic approach, but the company declined to make the system available for an independent audit. The company, Larsen said, is \u201cexploring the use of an independent auditor right now, to see how that could work.\u201d\n\nHireVue launched its AI assessment service in 2014 as an add-on to its video-interview software, which more than 700 companies have already used for nearly 12 million interviews worldwide. The Utah-based company won\u2019t disclose its revenue, the cost for employers or a full list of clients.\n\nThe company said last month that the private-equity giant Carlyle Group would become its new majority investor, providing an undisclosed sum from an $18.5 billion fund. Patrick McCarter, a managing director at the investment firm \u2014 which uses HireVue\u2019s video interviews internally, and said it \u201cwill look to deploy AI-driven candidate assessments over time\u201d \u2014 said the money would help the company expand into more employers and more specialized job openings, both in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nAt the hotel giant Hilton International, thousands of applicants for reservation-booking, revenue-management and call-center positions have now gone through HireVue\u2019s AI system, and executives credit the automated interviews with shrinking their average hiring time from six weeks to five days.\n\nSarah Smart, the company\u2019s vice president of global recruitment, said the system has radically redrawn Hilton\u2019s hiring rituals, allowing the company to churn through applicants at lightning speed. Hiring managers inundated with applicants can now just look at who the system ranked highly and filter out the rest: \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a recruiter to need to go out of that range,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the consumer-goods conglomerate Unilever, HireVue is credited with helping save 100,000 hours of interviewing time and roughly $1 million in recruiting costs a year. Leena Nair, the company\u2019s chief human-resource officer, said the system had also helped steer managers away from hiring only \u201cmini-mes\u201d who look and act just like them, boosting the company\u2019s \u201cdiversity hires,\u201d as she called them, about 16 percent.\n\n\u201cThe more digital we become, the more human we become,\u201d she added.\n\nDane E. Holmes, the global head of \u201chuman capital management\u201d at HireVue client Goldman Sachs, wrote in the Harvard Business Review this spring that the banking giant\u2019s roughly 50,000 video-interview recordings were \u201ca treasure trove of data that will help us conduct insightful analyses.\"\n\nThat data, he said, would help the company figure out how candidates\u2019 skills and backgrounds might correspond to how well they\u2019d work or how long they\u2019d stay at the firm. The company, he added, is also \u201cexperimenting with r\u00e9sum\u00e9-reading algorithms\u201d that would help decide new hires\u2019 departments and tasks.\n\n\u201cCan I imagine a future in which companies rely exclusively on machines and algorithms to rate r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and interviews? Maybe, for some,\u201d he wrote. (The \u201chuman element\u201d of recruiting, he pledged, would survive at Goldman Sachs.)\n\nHireVue\u2019s expansion has also helped it win business from smaller groups such as re:work, a Chicago nonprofit that trains unemployed local job-seekers for careers in the tech industry. Shelton Banks, the group\u2019s chief, said HireVue had proven to be an irreplaceable guide in assessing which candidates would be worth the effort.\n\nThe nonprofit once allowed mostly anyone into its intensive eight-week training program, but many burned out early. Now, every candidate goes through the AI assessment first, which ranks them on problem-solving and negotiation skills and helps them determine who might have the most motivation, curiosity and grit.\n\n\u201cKnowing where that person is at a starting place, when it comes to this person\u2019s life,\u201d Banks said, \u201ccan help us make more accurate assessments of the people we\u2019re saying yes or no to.\u201d\n\nBut Lisa Feldman Barrett, a neuroscientist who studies emotion, said she\u2019s \u201cstrongly skeptical\u201d that the system can really comprehend what it\u2019s looking at. She recently led a team of four senior scientists, including an expert in so-called \u201ccomputer vision\u201d systems, in assessing more than a thousand published research papers studying whether the human face shows universal expressions of emotion, and how well algorithms can understand them.\n\nThe systems, they found, have become quite perceptive at detecting facial movements \u2014 spotting the difference, say, between a smile and a frown. But they\u2019re still worryingly imprecise in understanding what those movements actually mean, and woefully unprepared for the vast cultural and social distinctions in how people show emotion or personality.\n\nLook at scowling, she said: A computer might see a person\u2019s frown and furrowed brow and assume they\u2019re easily angered \u2014 a red flag for someone seeking a sales-associate job. But people scowl all the time, she said, \u201cwhen they\u2019re not angry: when they\u2019re concentrating really hard, when they\u2019re confused, when they have gas.\u201d\n\nLuke Stark, a researcher at Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Montreal studying emotion and AI \u2014 who spoke as an individual, not as a Microsoft employee \u2014 was similarly skeptical of HireVue\u2019s ability to predict a worker\u2019s personality from their intonation and turn of phrase.\n\nSystems like HireVue, he said, have become quite skilled at spitting out data points that seem convincing, even when they\u2019re not scientifically backed. And he finds this \u201ccharisma of numbers\u201d really troubling, because of the overconfidence employers might lend them while seeking to decide the path of applicants\u2019 careers.\n\nThe best AI systems today, he said, are notoriously prone to misunderstanding meaning and intent. But he worried that even their perceived success at divining a person\u2019s true worth could help perpetuate a \u201chomogenous\u201d corporate monoculture of automatons, each new hire modeled after the last.\n\nThe company, HireVue\u2019s Larsen said, audits its performance data to look for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, known as adverse impacts, using \u201cworld-class bias testing\u201d techniques. The company\u2019s algorithms, he added, have been trained \u201cusing the most deep and diverse data set of facial action units available, which includes people from many countries and cultures.\u201d\n\nHireVue\u2019s growth, however, is already running into some regulatory snags. In August, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed a first-in-the-nation law that will force employers to tell job applicants how their AI-hiring system works and get their consent before running them through the test. The measure, which HireVue said it supports, will take effect Jan. 1.\n\nState Rep. Jaime Andrade, Jr., who co-sponsored the bill, said he pushed the transparency law after learning how many job applicants were rejected at the AI stage of a job interview. He worried that spoken accents or cultural differences could end up improperly warping the results, and that people who declined to sit for the assessment could be unfairly punished by not being considered for the job.\n\n\u201cWhat is the model employee? Is it a white guy? A white woman? Someone who smiles a lot?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the data points being used? There has to be some explanation, and there has to be consent.\u201d\n\nHireVue cautions candidates that there is no way to trick, cheat or hack the system, because it assesses tens of thousands of factors to assess a \u201cunique set of personal competencies.\u201d \u201cDo what feels most natural to you,\u201d the company says in an online guide.\n\nBut roughly a dozen interviewees who have taken the AI test \u2014 including some who got the job \u2014 told The Post it felt alienating and dehumanizing to have to wow a computer before being deemed worthy of a company\u2019s time.\n\nThey questioned what would be done with the video afterward and said they felt uneasy about having to perform to unexplained AI demands. Several said they refused to do the interview outright because, in the words of one candidate, the idea \u201cmade my skin crawl.\u201d\n\nCandidates said they have scrambled for ideas on how to maximize their worthiness before the algorithm\u2019s eye, turning to the hundreds of videos and online handbooks suggesting, for instance, that they sit in front of a clean white wall, lest the background clutter dock their grade. \u201cGlue some googly eyes to your webcam. It\u2019ll make it easier to maintain eye contact,\u201d one user on the message board Reddit suggested.\n\nStark, the AI researcher, said these \u201cfolk theories of algorithms\u201d were a natural response for people facing impenetrable AI systems with the power to decide their fate. The survival techniques could feel reassuring, he said, even if they were wrong: Pick the right words, use the right tone, put on a sufficiently happy face. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of trying to give people confronting an opaque system they don\u2019t understand some feeling of agency,\u201d he said.\n\nBut some HireVue interviewees questioned whether it was fair or even smart to judge a person\u2019s workplace performance or personal abilities based on half an hour spent looking into a webcam. They also worried that people\u2019s nerves about the odd nature of the exam might end up disqualifying them outright.\n\nKatherine Li, a University of Chicago junior who went through a HireVue interview for an investment-banking internship at Goldman Sachs, said she built a question bank of potential prompts and practiced her answers in the mirror to ensure she\u2019d look \u201csane.\u201d But she still found the whole process a bit unnerving.\n\n\u201cThe weirdness comes from not really understanding what you have to do to impress the algorithm,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and a computer and no feedback in terms of if you\u2019re doing something right or wrong.\u201d\n\nEmma Rasiel, an economics professor at Duke University who regularly advises students seeking jobs on Wall Street, said she has seen a growing number of students excessively unsettled about their upcoming HireVue test. The university\u2019s economics department now offers a guide to HireVue interviews on its student-resources website, including typical questions (\u201cWhat does integrity mean to you?\u201d) and behavioral tips (\u201cAct natural, talk slowly!\u201d).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a new and untried way of communicating who they are that it adds to their anxiety,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an anxious generation, and now we\u2019re asking them to talk to a computer screen, answering questions to a camera \u2026 with no real guidelines on how to make themselves look better or worse.\u201d\n\nThe mysterious demands can also push people\u2019s angst into overdrive. When Sheikh Ahmed, a 25-year-old in Queens, applied for teller jobs at banks around New York, he said he received eight HireVue assessment offers, all scheduled for the same day.\n\nHe studied guides on how to talk and act, but found the hardest part was figuring out the camera angle: Too high, he worried, and he\u2019d look domineering; too low, and he\u2019d look shrunken and weak.\n\nBefore his marathon of AI interviews, he put on a crisp dress shirt, a tie and pajama pants and went to his dad\u2019s soundproof music studio, away from the family\u2019s chirping society finch. He also turned off his air-conditioning system in hopes the background noise wouldn\u2019t mess up his score.\n\nHe changed his answers ever so slightly in each interview, in the hopes that the algorithm would find something it liked. But he found it exhausting and disheartening to boil down his life experience and worthiness into a computer-friendly sound bite.", "description": "HireVue claims it uses artificial intelligence to decide who\u2019s best for a job.
