She was later joined in the process by former Prime Minister John Major and opposition political parties.\n\nMiller told reporters outside court that parliament should be sitting during such a crucial time for Britain's democracy, and she would not give up the fight.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has pencilled in Sept. 17 for the appeal hearing,\" she said. \"My legal team and I will not give up the fight for democracy.\"\n\nMiller's lawyer, David Pannick, argued on Thursday that comments from Johnson showed an important part of his reasoning for the prorogation, or suspension, was that parliament might say or do something that impeded the government's Brexit plans.\n\nThe legal challenge has lost some of its impact after lawmakers voted this week to force Johnson to seek a three-month delay to Brexit rather than leave without an agreement on Oct. 31, a move that is likely to lead to an election.\n\nSeparate legal challenges to Johnson's Brexit plans are also being heard in Scotland and Northern Ireland.", "description": "London's High Court on Friday rejected a legal challenge against British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of parliament before Brexit, but said it could be taken to the Supreme Court for an appeal, the BBC said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104269927-GettyImages-542984918.jpg?v=1532563917", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
