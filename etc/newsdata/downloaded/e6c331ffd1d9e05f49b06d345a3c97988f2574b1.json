That ended by accident on Wednesday when Trump spoke before an energy conference in Pittsburgh promoting the oil and natural gas industries. Describing his plans to secure the border, he went on a tear:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a wall on the border of New Mexico. And we\u2019re building a wall in Colorado. We\u2019re building a beautiful wall. A big one that really works. You can\u2019t get over you can\u2019t get under. And we\u2019re building a wall in Texas.\u201d\n\nTrump \u2014 who didn\u2019t know that Nepal or Bhutan existed, and invented the country of \u201cNambia\u201d \u2014 may not consider the world map to be an important part of his foreign policy. But this marks the first time he\u2019s had such a severe geographical slip stateside. Maybe he does want to build a border wall within the American interior, or maybe he just got excited, Howard Dean-style, while listing good states; either way, the crowd didn\u2019t notice, giving him a standing ovation as he described walling off the southwest.\n\nThough the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor have no plans to construct a wall between Colorado and New Mexico, there\u2019s no real plan to build on the southern border either \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s September decision to move $3.6 billion in military funding to the project. As of August, the administration could only boast of 60 miles of new barriers along the 1,954-mile border.", "description": "At an energy conference in Pittsburgh promoting oil and natural gas, Donald Trump described his plans to secure the border, including his plan to build a wall in Colorado.
