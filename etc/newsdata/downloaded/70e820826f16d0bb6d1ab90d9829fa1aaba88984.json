Piggybacking off what Katie wrote five days ago, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) knew about the whistleblower complaint a month ago and didn\u2019t say anything. Now, The New York Times is reporting that Schiff knew there was going to be such a report from a whistleblower before this person had formally filed the complaint. The person is reportedly a CIA agent.\n\nHouse Democrats decided to execute their impeachment plan, which has been in the works since 2016, over Trump\u2019s alleged shakedown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to the liberal media, Trump threatened to withhold military aid unless the Ukrainians opened a corruption probe into Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of an energy company, which many see as a move to sell access to his father, Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time. Zelensky never felt pressured. There was no mentioning of aid. There was no quid, so the quid pro quo is another belly flop by the anti-Trump media establishment. Still, do we have Democrat-Intelligence Community collusion here? (via NYT) [emphasis mine]:\n\nThe Democratic head of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, learned about the outlines of a C.I.A. officer\u2019s concerns that President Trump had abused his power days before the officer filed a whistle-blower complaint, according to a spokesman and current and former American officials. The early account by the future whistle-blower shows how determined he was to make known his allegations that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s government to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 election. It also explains how Mr. Schiff knew to press for the complaint when the Trump administration initially blocked lawmakers from seeing it. Before going to Congress, the C.I.A. officer had a colleague convey his accusations to the agency\u2019s top lawyer. Concerned about how that avenue for airing his allegations was unfolding, the officer then approached a House Intelligence Committee aide, alerting him to the accusation against Mr. Trump. In both cases, the original accusation was vague. The House staff member, following the committee\u2019s procedures, suggested the officer find a lawyer to advise him and file a whistle-blower complaint. The aide shared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff. The aide did not share the whistle-blower\u2019s identity with Mr. Schiff, an official said.\n\nThis whole fiasco is even more pathetic than the Russian collusion nonsense that was peddled for over two years. Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s final report was the final blow to this whole conspiracy theory: there is no evidence to suggest the Trump team and the Kremlin colluded; a point that many saw from the get-go.\n\nAnd now, the complaint that set off this impeachment push that\u2019s pretty much been exposed as a nothing burger was known to overtly anti-Trump Democrats before it was even filed. There\u2019s a lot of shadow business being done here regarding a process that should be very public, but hey\u2014I\u2019m just one who thinks there\u2019s a rule of law and doesn\u2019t think a president should be booted because he won an election.\n\nWatch President Trump's response to the story below.", "description": ".10/03/2019 3:06:21AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/ccba51c4-ea60-4f5b-9d9a-e3a266faf8bb.png"}
