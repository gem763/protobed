Great weather, fans going crazy, packed to the roof \u2014 everything I\u2019ve dreamed of.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles might have movie stars and New York might have Wall Street\u2019s savviest, but the Nationals\u2019 appearance in the World Series \u2014 the city\u2019s first such game since 1933 \u2014 cast a spotlight on the District\u2019s version of celebrity, drawing together pundits, lobbyists and politicos who are otherwise drifting apart in one of the most tumultuous periods the nation\u2019s political class has known. For many, this Nats\u2019 run comes at the perfect time, a thin red thread holding together the city\u2019s political class.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re a company town,\u201d said NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd. \u201cWashington exists and thrives because of the government. And when the government is at war with itself, Washington is in knots. It\u2019s not a fun place to be. But then we have the Nats.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTodd watched Friday evening\u2019s game with his son, superstitiously wearing the same shirt and hat he wore as the Nats made their way to the sport\u2019s biggest stage this month. The \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host said this October has been unusual in Washington because the political discussions have felt so heavy but the Nats have provided the perfect emotional counterweight for many.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a few conversations with sources complaining, but then we\u2019re all able to calm down for a second and say, \u2018Are you going to the game?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably cut down on the number of reporter-source arguments over the past two weeks.\u201d\n\nTalking shop these days \u2014 be it in newsrooms or Capitol Hill offices \u2014 often focuses on Republican-Democratic squabbling over impeachment, the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from Syria or the steady drip of palace intrigue oozing out of the White House. But for fun, water-cooler chatter inevitably comes back to pitching matchups, bullpen maneuvering and speculating on Nationals phenom Juan Soto\u2019s career trajectory.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt has been a unifying thing in the city,\u201d said CNN\u2019s John King, who watched Friday\u2019s game alongside his two sons in the club level on the first base side. \u201cIf you lift your head and look around and do what I do every day, there\u2019s a lot of not-so-unifying things going on in the city. So it\u2019s nice to have a great escape in sports.\u201d\n\nNo one pretends that a baseball team is bridging the capital\u2019s ideological gaps. But the Nats have provided a common ground, a temporary one-month-only safe space. The Nats\u2019 World Series run is an experience shared by the Washington that\u2019s elected to live here and that which chooses to. It\u2019s embraced by the Washingtonians who ride the Metro, punch a clock and send their children to public schools and that other Official Washington, an only-in-D. C. population of neckties elected to office, power brokers pulling strings, TV pundits filling airtime and journalists pushing deadline. It\u2019s a weird collection, no doubt, and it\u2019s much easier for them all to agree on Nats pitching ace Max Scherzer than any piece of policy coming from Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cWashington is so polarized and people are so divided into their political tribes, and to have something everyone could agree on and everybody feels good about is pretty welcome \u2014 something to be savored,\u201d said Chris Wallace, the Fox News host.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWallace is a longtime fan of Washington\u2019s sports teams who was at the Nationals\u2019 2005 debut at RFK Stadium and has sat through many games since, years remembered for the team\u2019s embarrassing struggles and more recently high expectations and inevitable disappointments.\n\n\u201cIt became crushing. You\u2019d think this is the year they\u2019re going to do it, and they\u2019d somehow find a way to lose. Now they always find a way to win,\u201d said Wallace, who arrived at the ballpark more than two hours early Friday, sporting a red tie. \u201cLike a lot of things in life, the fact that you\u2019ve gone through so many tough times and disappointments makes the success this year that much sweeter. It feels like we\u2019ve earned it.\u201d\n\nColumnist George Will, the baseball enthusiast whose political commentary is published in newspapers across the country, including The Washington Post, helps throw a party every year on Opening Day, the kind of soiree that often attracts both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCities are necessarily lonely places,\u201d Will said Friday night, \u201cwhich is why there\u2019s a sense in which sports teams are an adhesive that pulls things together.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of overlap between baseball and politics, of course \u2014 mounds of data, strategy and competition \u2014 but the allure for some here is simpler.\n\n\u201cPeople in Washington need something other than politics to talk about,\u201d Will said. \u201cBruce Catton, the great Civil War historian, said baseball is the greatest conversation topic ever invented. So it\u2019s a great way to change the subject.\u201d\n\nThere was no top-level baseball in Washington from 1972 to 2004. Many questioned whether the city could support a baseball team. Two major league teams had abandoned the District.\n\nAD\n\nEven if there were doubters \u2014 and plenty of complications in bringing a team to town, building a new stadium and fielding a roster that could somehow compete for a championship \u2014 baseball has long captured the imagination of official Washington, dating back at least to 1910, when Howard Taft threw out a ceremonial first pitch on the Washington Senators\u2019 Opening Day, the first of 18 sitting presidents to do so.\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump has yet to throw out a first pitch but is planning to attend his first Nats contest Sunday, if the series reaches a fifth game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special event he should be at,\u201d Lerner said.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 leadership chose who\u2019d throw out the ceremonial first pitch at its home games for the World Series, settling on members of the inaugural 2005 Nationals team Friday, a player from the team\u2019s youth baseball academy in Game 4 on Saturday and chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a noted Trump critic, in Game 5.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe felt there are many other candidates that should be considered before him,\u201d Lerner said of Trump. \u201cWe just wanted to have the right people.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s elite and influential have long enjoyed a special relationship with baseball. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor threw out a first pitch last month. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh had to explain how he funded his season tickets before his confirmation. And others \u2014 justices and elected officials alike \u2014 have been spotted in the owners\u2019 box behind home plate. It\u2019s just a mile from the Capitol, but for three or so hours on a summer night, it can feel much farther.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing to take your mind off Washington,\u201d said Fox News anchor Bret Baier.\n\nAD\n\nEven in a city where connections are everything, Game 3 tickets were not easy to come by. They sold on the secondary market for well into the four figures, and federal law prevents elected officials from accepting them as gifts.\n\n\u201cI work for the government,\u201d said Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.). \u201cThose tickets are a little too rich for me.\u201d\n\nMost of her congressional colleagues are part of the \u201ctransient crowd,\u201d the group that can sometimes make people elsewhere forget that so many call the D.C. area home. The Nationals, Wexton said, are a reminder of that.\n\n\u201cWashington gets a bad rap, sometimes, around the country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have pride in our city. We feel strongly about our teams. So it\u2019s super exciting to have the Nats doing so well \u2026 finally.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHad the Nationals made this run a few years sooner, Harry M. Reid probably would have been in the stands. Friday, he planned to watch from home in Nevada. The former Senate Democratic leader is 79 and battling cancer, but he has followed the team all year.\n\nReid was a part of Washington so long he attended Senators game at Griffith Stadium. During his days in the Senate, Reid said, baseball was often an icebreaker. It allowed him to find common ground with Jim Bunning, a former big league pitcher from Kentucky who served two terms in the Senate as a staunch conservative.\n\n\u201cHe was noted for being just a surly, big, mean guy,\u201d Reid recalled abut Bunning. \u201c \u2026 But I loved talking to him. And we talked baseball. It was so much fun. I enjoyed that so, so much.\u201d\n\nFriday brought the District a baseball game it won\u2019t soon forget. Impeachment-related hearings were scheduled for Saturday. The Sunday political shows had a busy lineup on tap. But for at least a couple of more days, there\u2019s a bit more October baseball to be shared.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s a little bit unfortunate about this World Series,\u201d said Fox\u2019s Wallace, \u201cis that it will be over soon and we won\u2019t have that to rally around.\u201d\n\nAdam Kilgore contributed to this report.", "description": "The first game in D.C. since 1933 offers politicos, pundits and lobbyists a respite from the strife.", "authors": ["Rick Maese", "Reporter Covering A Variety Of Subjects", "Including Health", "Safety", "Olympics", "Legal", "Political Issues In Sports", "Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/K74gLcbSh7LmRTNM09mU8C_jnMY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4GAEH7XXQ4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
