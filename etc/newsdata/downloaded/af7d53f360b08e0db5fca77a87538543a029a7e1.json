Abigail Spanberger is all in on gun control", "language": "en", "text": "Abigail Spanberger knows guns.\n\nHer father, a local cop turned federal officer, was always armed. As a child, she revered \u2014 but never touched \u2014 the cherry wood cabinet where her uncle kept hunting rifles. And as a onetime federal agent herself, she carried a 9mm Beretta handgun, able to drop and reload magazines in an instant.\n\nBut the freshman congresswoman is backing a raft of gun-control measures, and not only those with bipartisan support, such as universal background checks and \u201cred flag\u201d laws that would temporarily take guns from people deemed to be dangerous. She also wants to ban military-style weapons.\n\nA Democrat who unseated Republican Dave Brat in the suburbs outside Richmond last year, Spanberger is unabashed in her position on guns, which she says is largely in sync with the voters in her conservative district.\n\nA new Washington Post-ABC poll backs her up. The survey found that Americans \u2014 of both parties \u2014 overwhelmingly support expanded background checks for gun buyers and allowing law enforcement to temporarily seize weapons from troubled individuals. A majority also supports a nationwide ban on assault weapons and a ban on high-capacity magazine clips, the survey found.\n\nElection results and polling data haven\u2019t swayed Republican leaders who showed no willingness to take action on gun legislation when they returned to Capitol Hill last week, after a summer recess in which dozens died in mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, Ohio, and Odessa, Tex.\n\nFollowing a shooting in May in Virginia Beach that left 12 dead, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) convened a special session of the General Assembly to take up gun control, but Republican leaders abruptly shut it down after 90 minutes without debating legislation.\n\nSpanberger joined fellow Democrats over the August recess and last week in Washington to urge Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to hold floor votes on House-passed legislation.\n\nThe bills would expand background checks and close the \u201cCharleston loophole,\u201d which allowed Dylann Roof to buy the gun he used to kill nine parishioners in 2015 at Mother Emanuel church in the South Carolina city.\n\nConstituents have been calling offices in tears begging for action, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is just grossly political, and people are dying because of it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Senate is willing to not uphold the will of the American people, and it\u2019s all political. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d\n\nTina Ramirez, the only Republican so far raising money to challenge Spanberger in 2020, said existing gun laws are sufficient. She said gaps in the mental health system were partially to blame for the proliferation mass shootings.\n\nRamirez, who leads a nonprofit organization devoted to religious liberty, doesn\u2019t mention the issue on her campaign website.\n\n\u201cThe real issue here is not more government,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWe need to stop looking to the government to be the solution for everything.\u201d\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, which is already targeting Spanberger\u2019s district, framed the congresswoman\u2019s support for gun control as too liberal for her central Virginia district.\n\n\u201cAbigail Spanberger is no moderate and it\u2019s not surprising she\u2019s joining the socialist Democrats in stripping away Virginians\u2019 2nd Amendment rights,\u201d NRCC spokeswoman Camille Gallo said in a statement.\n\nWhile Ramirez\u2019s position could help in a GOP nomination contest, it\u2019s unclear how voters will react in the general election.\n\n\u201cThe issue of background checks in particular puts suburban Republicans in a bind,\u201d said David Wasserman, who analyzes House races at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report and considers the district a toss-up at this early stage. \u201cExpanding gun control is a loser in a Republican primary, but opposing expanded background checks is a loser in a general election in districts such as these.\u201d\n\nLori Haas, the Virginia state director at the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, rejects the notion, once orthodoxy in Virginia, that conservative voters are against gun control.\n\n\u201cDoing nothing has become so politically toxic to Republicans that they\u2019re crossing the aisle and voting for Democrats,\u201d said Haas, whose daughter was wounded in the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech.\n\nSpanberger said her work in law enforcement and the CIA informs her position on gun control. It\u2019s because of her experiences with guns, not despite them, that she favors stricter regulation, she said.\n\n\u201cWhat responsible gun owner thinks everyone and anyone should have access to a firearm without a little bit of precaution taken to make sure that those who have a history of violent harm can\u2019t buy a firearm?\u201d she said.\n\nWhile training to serve as a federal officer with the postal inspection service, she practiced multiple times a week for several hours at a time on all aspects of gun safety.\n\nShe was taught the expected skills of loading the magazine and firing at a target. But she also learned how to move through the world with a firearm on her hip: how to clean it, how to take it apart and how to cover it with her jacket even on sweltering days.\n\nEvery six months during her 2\u00bd years with the agency, she spent a full day at the gun range requalifying on her Beretta and side holster. She never shot her weapon on the job but used it all the time to serve search warrants and clear rooms.\n\nAt the CIA, she trained on a variety of firearms to prepare for escape if ambushed.\n\nThere have also been surreal moments. When she was first married, her husband, who did not grow up around guns, would find it jarring to wake up to the \u201cch-ch\u201d sound of his wife loading her weapon, she said. She hasn\u2019t kept a gun in her home since starting a family.\n\n\u201cThe norm for me is, this is a tool,\u201d she said. \u201cFor my dad, this was a tool for his job. For my uncle, it was tool for hunting.\u201d\n\nSpanberger left the CIA in 2014 and moved home to Virginia, where she joined the local chapter of Moms Demand Action.\n\nThere, she met Gena Reeder of Chesterfield and others like her who have helped swing the once deep-red area blue, largely on the basis of social issues like gun control.\n\nReeder, an outspoken Democrat who has lived in the district for more than 20 years, said she has seen her neighbors lose faith in GOP leaders who balk at tightening gun laws.\n\n\u201cThe suburban districts are starting to lose their appetite for Republican representation, I think, because of this very issue,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrats held a Capitol Hill hearing Sept. 10, featuring gun violence victims and advocates, a retired police chief, a trauma surgeon, a mayor and a hunter who is a veteran, all discussing why guns should be more regulated.\n\nSpanberger, 40, can mark the passage of time by major shootings.\n\nShe was in college in 1999 when Columbine happened. Then came Virginia Tech, which hit home for the Virginia native. One of her kids started attending a new school in 2012, when 20 first-graders were massacred in Newtown, Conn.\n\nShe recently overheard a conversation between her 8-year-old and 5-year-old daughters about the first week of school.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s a lock-and-hide drill,\u201d the third-grader said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d the kindergartner asked.\n\nSpanberger froze.\n\n\u201cHere I have an 8-year-old explaining to a 5-year-old how she\u2019s going to train to hide in a closet in case someone comes to kill them in their school,\u201d she said, speaking through tears.\n\n\u201cAs their parent and as a lawmaker, I can\u2019t protect them. . . . It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nThis is part of an occasional series of stories about Spanberger\u2019s first year in office.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The moderate Democrat from a suburban district in Virginia wants a ban on military-style weapons, among other changes.", "authors": ["Jenna Portnoy", "Reporter Covering Virginia", "Maryland", "D.C.
