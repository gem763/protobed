At the height of the Cold War there were some 400,000 U.S. forces on the European continent. Today there are around 62,000. Even though the 2018 National Defense Strategy calls on the Department of Defense to \u2018develop a lethal, agile and resilient force posture and employment,\u2019 there has been no move yet to bolster the meager U.S. military presence in Europe.\n\n\u201cThat must change. Russia\u2019s advantage over the U.S. and our allies in the region continues to grow. As The Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2019 Index of U.S. Military Strength highlights, Russian military forces would vastly outnumber NATO forces in the vicinity of the Baltic states, a potential future battleground. The Trump administration must move swiftly to remedy this shortfall and forward-station more capabilities in Europe.\u201d", "description": "Washington, D.C. -- Lt. Gen.
