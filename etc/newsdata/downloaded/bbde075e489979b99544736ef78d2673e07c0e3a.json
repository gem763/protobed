Jakobsdottir had initially announced she would not be able to meet Pence because of a prior commitment, but the two merged schedules days before Pence's arrival. (Egill Bjarnason/AP)\n\nVice President Pence and his extensive security detail raised eyebrows on Wednesday as they traveled through the capital city of Iceland, a famously peaceful country where its president travels alone on private errands.\n\nPence was the first U.S. vice president to visit Iceland since George H.W. Bush went to Reykjavik in 1983, similarly causing a stir with his \u201cattendant paraphernalia of Air Force Two, bulletproof limousines and White House telecommunication equipment,\u201d The Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nWeeks before Pence\u2019s visit, Secret Service personnel were seen in the city scouting out locations, the Associated Press reported. Bomb-sniffing dogs were given special clearance to enter the country, and police officers from outside the capital were sent in to help the Reykjavik police meet security standards set by the United States. During the visit Wednesday, U.S. security personnel \u2014 who had to be given special permission to bear arms \u2014 trailed the vice president through the city. When Pence met with Icelandic officials, snipers were seen perched on the rooftops of nearby buildings, the AP wrote.\n\n\u201cThe scale of Pence\u2019s visit, not least the security arrangements, are greater than ever seen in Iceland before,\u201d added RUV, the country\u2019s national broadcasting service.\n\nIt is not uncommon for U.S. leaders to travel with a large security detail \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s 2015 visit to New Delhi reportedly sent it into a lockdown \u2014 but such visits can be particularly challenging for smaller countries.\n\nIceland, a country of 350,000 people, has a remarkably small police force, the majority of which is armed only with batons and pepper spray. The country\u2019s president, Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson, has been spotted, among other things, visiting a popular geothermal bath and \u201cplogging\u201d (picking up rubbish while jogging) around the presidential residence on his own.\n\nAhead of the visit, local news outlets worked to warn residents of the major road closures that were expected to cause traffic delays. According to the Reykjavik Grapevine, a magazine, police were urging residents to show \u201cpatience and understanding.\u201d\n\nPolice say that traffic delays can be expected around the city, especially in the afternoon, and are asking the general public to show patience and understanding. As Pence will only be in the country for seven hours, and is expected to meet with Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, this delay will be mercifully temporary.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s trip was surrounded by several controversies.\n\nIt was initially reported that Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir would not be in town during Pence\u2019s visit, sparking applause from critics of the administration who saw the move as a deliberate snub (Jakobsdottir said it was not, and wound up meeting him on Wednesday.) When the vice president, a conservative Christian and an opponent of same-sex marriage, arrived on the island, he was met with a flurry of rainbow flags, an oft-used symbol of LGBTQ pride.\n\nJohannesson and his wife Eliza Reid also reportedly wore rainbow bracelets during their meeting with Pence.\n\nso at his stop at H\u00f6f\u00f0i (house where Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Reykjav\u00edk occurred), @vp was met by this not-so-subtle display and then the mayor said he grieved the loss of the INF treaty that emerged from the summit but was recently withdrawn from by the trump administration pic.twitter.com/89P8nQmupc \u2014 Justin Sink (@justinsink) September 4, 2019", "description": "Locals were reportedly told to show \u201cpatience and understanding\u201d for the vice president\u2019s seven-hour visit.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GRKlAvjy3W67yp4xan7_qNq-uwo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YLXC3MWPKQI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
