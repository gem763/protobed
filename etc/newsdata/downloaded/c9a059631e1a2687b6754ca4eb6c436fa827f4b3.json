The pro-democracy protest is demanding several measures to ensure that communist law does not apply on Hong Kong soil, including the direct election of lawmakers.\n\nHong Kong police refused to give a permit for the protests on Tuesday, therefore branding all unarmed protesters criminal \u201crioters.\u201d Tsang, despite being in recovery after surgery in the hospital, was charged Thursday with rioting and \u201cassaulting a police officer.\u201d He faces up to ten years in prison.\n\nTsang is the first person to be shot with live rounds since protests erupted in June. Police have fired \u201cwarning shots\u201d in the sky on several other occasions and seriously injured protesters with tear gas canisters, rubber bullets, and bean bag rounds.\n\nPolice also used water cannons to disperse protesters on Tuesday, some equipped with ink meant to stain the protesters to identify them later.\n\nChief Superintendent John Tse answered questions from reporters Wednesday at a press conference on the crackdown Tuesday, which saw a new single-day record of arrests in this wave of protests, according to the Hong Kong Foreign Press (HKFP). He dismissed criticism that the officer who shot Tsang used unnecessary force, particularly when he had other weapons to diffuse the situation available.\n\n\u201cSome people have never received any professional firearms training. What is their basis to question the police\u2019s professional judgment?\u201d he asked Chief Superintendent John Tse.\n\nHong Kong allows the legal possession of firearms, but strongly discourages it. A firearms possessions license costs 2,730 Hong Kong dollars ($348.06) and requires a thorough application and background check. Only once the China-controlled Hong Kong government deems an individual \u201cfit and proper\u201d to possess a firearm can they do so; Hong Kong\u2019s government website appears to speak only of \u201cair guns\u201d with limited capacity as being legal.\n\nIn other words, very few people outside of Hong Kong\u2019s police force have access to the \u201cprofessional firearms training\u201d Tse claimed was necessary to judge police brutality.\n\nHong Kong Police Commissioner Stephen Lo similarly defended the as-yet-unnamed officer who shot Tse, leaving him in critical condition.\n\n\u201cMy colleague was under a close-range attack. He made a decision in a split-second because he felt his life and his colleague\u2019s were being threatened,\u201d Lo said on Wednesday. \u201cWe believe [the action] was reasonable and legal.\u201d\n\nChinese state media echoed the police\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cThe life of the officer at the scene was under serious threat and he was forced to shoot at the assailant to protect his own life as well as his colleagues,\u201d state news agency Xinhua declared on Wednesday. \u201c[His] action was totally legal, legitimate and appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times, another Communist Party newspaper, alleged that Tsang attacked the officer first with a baton \u2013 a claim that is behind the charges of assaulting a police officer that Tsang will fully face upon leaving the hospital.\n\nChinese media outlets further dismissed the protesters that took the streets Tuesday as a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d \u2013 a phrase popularized by former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to refer to supporters of President Donald Trump \u2013 and \u201cfanatical teeny-boppers.\u201d\n\nThe HKFP reported, citing the police force, that officers arrested 269 people on Tuesday and fired around 1,400 tear gas canisters at crowds. Those arrested ranged from ages 12 to 71 and most were men.\n\nThe Hong Kong protest movement has taken to supporting Tsang. Thousands once again flooded Hong Kong\u2019s streets on Wednesday and friends of Tsang\u2019s identified him as a \u201crole model\u201d at his high school and an exemplary adolescent, not the \u201crioter\u201d or thug that Hong Kong police are portraying him as.\n\nIn September, following the end of summer vacation, student protesters in Hong Kong announced a weekly boycott of classes on Monday as a form of protest against the Chinese regime.\n\nThe Hong Kong protest movement is making five demands of its government. The first, the withdrawal of a bill that would have allowed China to extradite anyone it considered in violation of its repressive speech and expression laws, has been met. Protesters are still demanding freedom for their political prisoners, the direct election of lawmakers, an end to referring to the protests as \u201criots,\u201d and an independent investigation into police brutality.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong political crisis is China\u2019s largest domestic challenge, Communist Party dictator Xi Jinping has only vaguely mentioned the situation in public remarks. On Tuesday, speaking before the 100,000 people who marched in celebration of communism in Tiananmen Square, Xi insisted on his goal to \u201cunite all Chinese sons and daughters,\u201d including those in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and abroad, but did not directly reference the protests.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Hong Kong's police superintendent said \"professional firearms training\" is necessary to judge if shooting an unarmed teen is self defense.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1171989037-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
