He then continued working in football - abusing teenage boys at Peterborough, where he worked between 1994 and 1996 - until the scandal of child sexual abuse emerged in 2016 and, as revealed last week by Telegraph Sport, 95 people came forward to allege abuse by Higgins. Of those, 82 were prior to 1989 and nine alleged abuse at Peterborough United.", "description": "The campaign to reform the double jeopardy law so that sexual offenders like former Southampton and Peterborough United coach Bob Higgins could potentially face retrial for previous abuse allegations has taken a major step forward.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000198261457-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
