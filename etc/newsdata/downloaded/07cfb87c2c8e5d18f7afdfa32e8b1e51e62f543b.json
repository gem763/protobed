Here\u2019s why.", "language": "en", "text": "Protesters called a general strike Monday; President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era said the country was at war. A state of emergency continued, and authorities declared more curfews. But after a bloody weekend, some public services resumed operations, and some businesses reopened.\n\nAD\n\nU.N. rights chief Michelle Bachelet called Monday for dialogue, independent investigations and an end to \u201cinflammatory rhetoric.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply disturbed and saddened to see violence, destruction, deaths & injuries in #Chile,\u201d tweeted Bachelet, Pi\u00f1era\u2019s predecessor as president of the Andean nation. \u201cI urge the Govt to work with all sectors to find solutions to address grievances and bring calm. I urge all planning to take part in protests to do so peacefully.\u201d\n\nThe youth-led demonstrations, sparked last week by an increase in subway fares in the capital, have grown and spread even after Pi\u00f1era rescinded the fare boost. Protesters have shut down public transportation, ransacked supermarkets and pharmacies, and set fire to subway stations and government buildings.\n\nAD\n\nPi\u00f1era, who was returned to the presidency last year after serving from 2010 to 2014, has responded by deploying more than 10,000 troops in the largest operation since the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet more than three decades ago. Security forces have fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowds.\n\nAD\n\nThree civilians died Sunday night, authorities said. One was shot; two died in a fire at a supermarket. Fifty security personnel were seriously injured.\n\n\u201cWe are at war against a powerful enemy, willing to use violence with no limits,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said in a nationally televised address Sunday evening.\n\nBut by Monday morning, the leader of the armed forces sought to walk back that claim.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI am at war with nobody,\u201d Gen. Javier Iturriaga told reporters.\n\nThe chaos follows protests against austerity and corruption in Haiti, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina and Honduras, among other countries. But Chile was supposed to be different. The country tops South America across virtually all tables: per capita GDP, the U.N. Human Development Index, multiple freedom rankings.\n\n\u201cEveryone following Latin America is watching this and saying, \u2018Oh my God, Chile, too?\u2019 \u201d said Brian Winter, vice president for policy at the Americas Society/Council of the Americas.\n\nAD\n\nWhy are Chileans protesting?\n\nThe 4 percent increase in subway fares sparked small demonstrations a week ago. Half of Chile\u2019s workers earn $550 per month or less, according to the national statistics institute, making public transportation a significant expenditure for many who live and work in the capital. By the end of last week, the movement had mushroomed into massive demonstrations against a rising cost of living and an economic model that angry Chileans say delivers growth unequally.\n\nAD\n\nSteady expansion over the past two decades has given the nation the biggest middle class and one of the lowest rates of poverty in the region. But high inequality has remained pretty much the same, according to the World Bank.\n\nProtesters complain of expensive private education and health care, the rising cost of public service and shrinking pensions. In June, the price of electricity rose by 10 percent.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor more than a decade now, studies have warned of the increasing frustration with living conditions in Chile, said Jorge Contesse, a law professor at Rutgers University. \u201cYet we keep being told that this was unforeseeable.\u201d\n\n\u201cChile is governed by a constitution that was crafted under the dictatorship, and which \u2014 despite significant reforms \u2014 has left the fundamental political and legal infrastructure unmodified and unresponsive to the demands of thousands, if not millions, of Chileans.\u201d\n\nSome are angry at Pi\u00f1era, a Harvard-educated millionaire who some say is out of touch with the people. Many feel trapped by the combination of increasing costs and an economic slowdown.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe anger that keeps people in the streets is against a model that privatizes and profits from all the aspects of our life,\u201d tweeted Emilia Schneider, head of the Federation of Students of the University of Chile. \u201cThe rise of the tickets was the drop that spilled the glass.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe added that no previous government has been able to solve the problem, either.\n\nWho\u2019s protesting?\n\nIt started with university students, who stormed subway stations last week without paying, chanted slogans and spray-painted walls. The protests continue to be dominated by students, but Chileans of all ages, workers and professionals, have joined. Opposition politicians have also taken part.\n\nAD\n\nPatricio Navia, a Chilean political scientist at New York University, noted the alienation of the middle class.\n\n\u201cPi\u00f1era\u2019s government has always been preoccupied with reducing poverty, and has also designed policies that help the rich, so the middle class feels abandoned,\u201d he said. \u201cThe middle class has been growing in Chile, but with a slowing economy, they feel like they were offered a path to the promised land and were never really let in.\u201d\n\nProtesters have targeted public transportation. At least 16 buses and eight subway stations have been burned, and service has been shut down. Santiago Metro General Manager Rub\u00e9n Alvarado said Sunday that losses would come to \u201cmuch more than $200 million.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt least 90 flights were canceled at Santiago International Airport over the weekend, according to local media. More than 5,000 people slept at the airport Saturday night. More than 20,000 homes in Santiago had no electricity Sunday, and 152 traffic lights were damaged.\n\nBy Monday, some service was restored. Energy Minister Juan Carlos Jobet told reporters that 76 gas stations had been destroyed over the weekend, but there was \u201cno problem\u201d with availability on Monday. He said that more than 99 percent of Chileans had their electricity back.\n\nHow has the government responded?\n\nPi\u00f1era declared a state of emergency in six cities Saturday, restricting rights of movement and assembly for 15 days. The military has declared overnight curfews in three cities. Security forces have fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters; videos circulating on social media show demonstrators tending to wounded comrades.\n\nPi\u00f1era said Saturday that the subway price increase would be reversed and called for dialogue. Student leaders and opposition politicians rejected that call until the state of emergency was canceled and soldiers returned to their barracks.\n\nPi\u00f1era met Sunday with leaders from the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate and the Supreme Court. The goal, he said, was to seek ways to \u201creduce excessive inequalities and abuses that our society continues to face.\u201d He predicted that Monday would be a \u201cdifficult day.\u201d He said those causing violence \u201chave a level of logistics that is characteristic of a criminal organization.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are against a powerful enemy that doesn\u2019t respect anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is willing to use violence without a limit, even when it means loss of human lives.\u201d\n\nHe distinguished between radical protesters and those who were in the streets to demand better life conditions.\n\n\u201cWe share many of your concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask you that we unite in this battle that we can\u2019t lose.\u201d\n\nBachelet said any state of emergency \u201cmust be exceptional and rooted in law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are disturbing allegations of excessive use of force by security and armed forces, and I am also alarmed by reports that some detainees have been denied access to lawyers, which is their right, and that others have been mistreated while in detention,\u201d she said.\n\nThe protests weren\u2019t yet expected to threaten Pi\u00f1era\u2019s hold on power before his term ends in 2022.\n\nAD\n\nWhy is Latin America erupting in unrest?\n\nAs in Chile, protesters in Ecuador and Argentina succeeded in forcing leaders to make concessions, which analysts say will likely encourage more protests. Growing access to social media has also helped galvanize movements.\n\nBut behind it all, analysts say, are unmet expectations, as broad growth during the commodities boom of the 1990s and 2000s has run into stagnation over the past decade as global prices have fallen, sparking frustration not just with political leaders but the whole economic and democratic system.\n\nLatin America\u2019s annual GDP growth rate rose from 0.3 percent in 1990 to nearly 6 percent in 2010, according to the World Bank. But it has since shrunk faster than the global average, to 1.4 percent in 2018.\n\nTrust in the political system, meanwhile, has reached a nadir. Pollster Latinobar\u00f3metro has found that less than 25 percent of the region\u2019s population is \u201csatisfied with democracy in their country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the economy has slowed over the last decade everywhere in the region, people are not seeing their lives improve as much as they expected and are lashing out against their governments, and the whole system,\u201d Winter said.\n\nWith frustration rising against center-right leaders in Chile, Ecuador and Argentina, he predicted rising support for leftists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like watching a fish flop around the table,\u201d Winter said. No one is really able to give the people what they want, so they elect someone from the other side of the political spectrum.", "description": "Demonstrations against a subway fare increase have spread and grown into a movement against the cost of living and persistent inequality.", "authors": ["Rachelle Krygier", "John Bartlett"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PxZUMuMuFrohql_8tPCJYQij_Tc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5RR6PXUBUI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
