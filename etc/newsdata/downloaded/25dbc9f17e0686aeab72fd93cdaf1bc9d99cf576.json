The cuts resulted in Husky declaring a one-time $233-million gain in its second-quarter results.\n\nBut while Peabody said he welcomes the tax cut and thinks it's good policy, he said the reason the company doesn't plan to invest as much in Alberta is because of the continuation by the United Conservatives of the NDP program to curtail oil production.\n\n\"We would love to spend more money in Alberta but, unfortunately, in Alberta ... there are quotas in place that mean we could spend to develop crude oil but then they wouldn't let us sell it. So that doesn't make any sense, either,\" he said.\n\nInvestment in Saskatchewan continues\n\nHusky is continuing to invest in Saskatchewan, however, Peabody said, noting it recently started up a 10,000-barrel-a-day thermal heavy oil project and has five other similar projects in development.\n\nHe added spending is continuing in the United States, where permits have been obtained to rebuild the Superior, Wis., oil refinery partly destroyed in a fire in April 2018, and on the East Coast of Canada, where its West White Rose offshore project is headed for a 2022 startup.\n\nAt its investor day last spring, Husky said it would slash its average budget by $350 million to $3.15 billion per year over the next five years, accomplishing that in part by cutting costs while still growing production by 100,000 barrels per day by 2023.\n\nOn Thursday, Husky said it is continuing to evaluate the sale of its retail operations after agreeing to sell its small Prince George, B.C., refinery to Calgary-based Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd. earlier this month.\n\nShare price down\n\nHusky shares fell by as much as 7.8 per cent to $8.76 in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday, despite meeting analyst expectations on financial and operating results. A year ago, it was trading at almost $20 per share.\n\nIt reported net earnings of $273 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, down from $545 million in the same quarter last year, as lower oil prices and refinery margins were partly offset by insurance payments of $132 million related to the Superior Refinery outage.\n\nThe company, which is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, reported revenue of $5.31 billion, down from $6.16 billion.\n\nUpstream production averaged 294,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 296,700 in the third quarter of 2018. The average realized price was $47.54 per barrel of oil equivalent, down from $50.44 a year earlier.\n\nUpgrader and refinery throughput was 356,400 barrels per day in the quarter, up from 350,600 in the same period in 2018.", "description": "The CEO of Calgary-based Husky Energy Inc. says social media speculation that layoffs put in place the morning after the federal election this week were in reaction to political events are just \"B.S.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4762451.1532612654!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/husky-energy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
