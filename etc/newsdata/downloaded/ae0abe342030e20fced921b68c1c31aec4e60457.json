Palm oil farmers are mostly to blame.", "language": "en", "text": "Forest fires that have ravaged Indonesia since July have blanketed the region in a thick, toxic smoke cloud that has sickened people and endangered wildlife, amid accusations from neighboring Malaysia that Indonesia\u2019s government is not doing enough to control the man-made wildfires.\n\nThe blazes, a persistent problem in the summer season, have been largely sparked by farmers who set land on fire to make room for new crops. The arid conditions following the dry and hot summer have made this year\u2019s infernos particularly devastating. The fires have destroyed more than 800,000 acres of land, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.\n\n\n\nForest fires continues to blaze in Pekanbaru in Riau province on Sept. 18.

Under an environmental protection law that forbids the setting of fires to clear land, they could face up to 10 years in prison.\n\n\n\nTwo children play on the edge of the forest fire in Pekanbaru in Riau province, Indonesia, on Sept. 18.

The Borneo Orangutan Survival foundation said, amid a thick and smoky haze, the organization was working to protect the 355 monkeys in its care, some of which have developed respiratory infections.\n\n\n\nBorneo orangutans on Salat Island, Idonesia, on Sept. 15.

Last week the country distributed 500,000 face masks as a thick smog hung in the air.\n\nSuch interruptions to Malaysia\u2019s environment have been costly in the past.\n\nA report published by the National University of Malaysia says the country lost $375 million in health care costs and loss of income in 2013, when smoke from Indonesian fires enveloped Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nThe Malaysian government said earlier this month it would call on Indonesia to take \u201cimmediate action\u201d in extinguishing the fires.\n\nThe disasters in Indonesia are only the latest in a year of ruinous forest fires around the world. In Brazil, similar land-clearing methods ignited blazes that have devastated the precious ecosystem of the Amazon Rainforest. And in Australia, fires continue to eat through dry brush in Queensland and New South Wales.\n\nEnvironmental activists warned that the global demand for Indonesian crops has pushed farmers to fan these destructive flames. Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest producer of palm oil, a product used in everything from peanut butter to shampoo. To continue harvesting this crop, farmers have steadily burned down trees, particularly in the tropical forests of Borneo, to make room for more harvesting.\n\n\n\nBaby snakes killed in a peatland forest fire are pictured at a palm oil plantation in Pekanbaru, Riau province, on Sept. 4.

As the New York Times reported in 2018, \u201cNASA researchers say the accelerated destruction of Borneo\u2019s forests contributed to the largest single-year global increase in carbon emissions in two millenniums, an explosion that transformed Indonesia into the world\u2019s fourth-largest source of such emissions.\u201d", "description": "The fires have engulfed the region in toxic fumes.", "authors": ["Research Assistant For The Today'S Worldview Newsletter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rN8470_NIrnsyLQfX5X421HN5-A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R7E6GKWX2AI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
