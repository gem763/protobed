But he followed it with a signed letter indicating that he does not favor another extension.\n\nEU officials have not responded to the request.\n\nJohnson could face legal challenges from opponents who feel that sending the second letter was done to frustrate Parliament, which has not approved his Brexit plan but does want to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nJohnson returns to Parliament on Monday to keep seeking support for his Brexit proposal, which was approved Thursday by EU leaders.", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pressing ahead to try to win parliamentary backing for his new Brexit deal as the European Union", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/20/a1321e_aptopix-britain-brexit-33390-britain-prime-minister-boris-johnson-speaks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
