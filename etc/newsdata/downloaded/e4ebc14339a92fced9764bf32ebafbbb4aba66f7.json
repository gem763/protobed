It cut off close to 6 million barrels a day in production. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil ministry said the country will restore most of its oil output and fully recover by the end of month\u2014 much earlier than anticipated.\n\nA picture taken on September 15, 2019 shows an Aramco oil facility near al-Khurj area, just south of the Saudi capital Riyadh. - Saudi Arabia raced today to restart operations at oil plants hit by drone attacks which slashed its production by half, as Iran dismissed US claims it was behind the assault.

Investigators discovered debris that appears to be Iranian cruise missile technology, the Journal reported.\n\n\u201cThose missiles are coming, and those rockets are coming, and those drones are coming from Iran, the only place that I can determine they would be coming from,\u201d Westphal said. \u201cI\u2019m sure inside their own country, Iran is having a turbulent discussion about how far they want to go with this, in terms of provoking the United States.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday evening, President Trump tweeted that the U.S. has \u201creason to believe that we know\u201d who is responsible for the attack on Saudia Arabia\u2019s oil field. On Monday, U.S. officials reportedly told Saudi Arabia that Iran was behind the attack. Yemen's Houthi rebels took responsibility for the attacks earlier this week, but they have been backed by Iran.\n\n\u201cI think we should be very actively involved in this,\u201d Westphal said. \u201cA relationship with Saudi Arabia is very, very critical to us.\u201d\n\nValentina Caval is a Producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia weighs in on how involved the U.S. should be after the latest attack on Saudi Arabia's crude oil infrastructure.", "authors": ["Valentina Caval"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y1bPQEYDro9_13QN.Mw14Q--~B/aD0zMTAwO3c9NDk4NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/7bd7d7e0-c6c9-11e9-bcfe-ce817aa2ff94", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
