Ollie Locke has dismissed the similarities between his character in new movie Greed and the real-life relationship he had with retail magnate heiress Chloe Green\n\nBut speaking to MailOnline, Ollie, 31, insists there's a lot more to his character, and the film's plot, than that. He also added that the coincidence of the real-life similarities was certainly beyond his power.\n\n'I cannot control either my past relationships or future film roles and this is certainly not all there is to the character of Fabian,' Ollie said. 'When I was asked to audition for the role and ultimately offered it, it was something I felt I had to be a part of.\n\n'It was a wonderful project to be involved and I am very proud of the part I played in it and the message of the film as a whole.'\n\nCoogan slammed Sir Philip at the movie's premiere last week, saying that the TopShop boss was 'a perfect focal point for the unchecked, unaccountable, unregulated ugliness of the market at its worst'.\n\nAs they were: Greed follows lead character Sir Richard McCreadie - played by Steve Coogan - who was inspired by Sir Philip Green, Chloe's father [Ollie and Chloe are pictured in 2011]\n\nArt imitating life? Ollie plays Fabian - the boyfriend of Sir Richard's daughter Lily [Sophie Cookson] - a role that sees art imitate life somewhat, given his dalliance in 2011 with Chloe\n\nHis character is the owner of a chain of clothes stores, one of which has recently collapsed, and who made an appearance in front of MPs about the matter, with disastrous results.\n\nOllie previously said at the premiere: 'Chlo and I went out a million years ago so it\u2019s nothing to do with that, it\u2019s only loosely based around a retail magnate, so it\u2019s a bit of fun and I hope that everyone believes it\u2019s a bit of fun and its not meant to be taken too seriously.'\n\nGreed marks the former Made In Chelsea stalwart's first jump towards Hollywood, having now not featured on reality TV for a year, and concentrating on what his next acting role will be.\n\nWeighing in: Speaking to MailOnline, Ollie, 31, insists there's a lot more to his character, and the film's plot, than that\n\nCompare and contrast: 'I cannot control either my past relationships or future film roles and this is certainly not all there is to the character of Fabian,' Ollie said\n\nOllie - who appeared on MIC since its inception in 2011, bringing Chloe with him on season two - was spotted on the set of Greed in Greece last year, with the likes of Isla Fisher and Shanina Shaik.\n\nGreed was filmed on Greece's Delos Island.\n\nMichael Winterbottom directs - having helmed the likes of 24 Hour Party People and The Wedding Guest.\n\nOllie has made no secret of the fact that he had hopes, when he was younger, of being an actor.\n\nKnown as one of the more 'expressive' stars of MIC, he has always had his fingers in plenty of pies. Having penned Sunday Times bestseller Laid In Chelsea and appearing on various other reality shows, the TV personality went into the world of online dating, co-launching gay app Chappy last year.\n\nIn good company: The 31-year-old TV star appears alongside Shanina Shaik\n\nCo-stars: Steve Coogan and Isla Fisher also star in Greed, as a billionaire and his wife\n\n'My new family!' Last year, Ollie uploaded a snap of him relaxing on a beach with [R-L] former Doctor Who star Pearl Mackie, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas actor Asa Butterfield and Kingsman actress Sophie Cookson\n\nThesp: He has also landed a part on ITV2 scripted comedy series Plebs, which aired in 2017\n\nSince then, he has also landed a part on ITV2 scripted comedy series Plebs.\n\n2018 saw him write a book alongside shooting Greed.\n\nBefore announcing his casting, Ollie took to Instagram last October to upload a snap of him relaxing on a beach with former Doctor Who star Pearl Mackie, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas actor Asa Butterfield and Kingsman actress Sophie Cookson. In the snap, Ollie branded them his 'new family'.\n\nTwo weeks later he uploaded another image of him overlooking the Greek sea.\n\nFun: Ollie and Pearl shot the film alongside Bad Education actress Sarah Solemani\n\nOn location: Isla has uploaded shots from Greece with some of the same actors and actresses last year\n\n'When you have a day off filming and I thank the world so much I get to do my job! I love trying to make people smile and will do everything in my power to try do that everyday! Xxx #greece #filming #secretproject, ' was the caption, still not letting on why he was abroad.\n\nAt the end of October, another shot materialised to mark the end of his shoot. Posing again with Pearl, and joined this time by Bad Education actress Sarah Solemani, Ollie snapped a selfie in front of the sunset.\n\nHe wrote: 'The eve of the last day of filming in Greece I can\u2019t wait for you all to watch what we have made! After 3 weeks we have all had a moment/s missing our families but beyond any project I have ever worked on became such a large part of each other lives and I can\u2019t wait to continue with more stories back at home Xxx [sic].'\n\nGreed is released in February 2020.", "description": "Ollie Locke has dismissed the similarities between his character in new movie Greed and the real-life relationship he had with retail magnate heiress Chloe Green.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/13/19787162-0-image-a-84_1571229800557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
