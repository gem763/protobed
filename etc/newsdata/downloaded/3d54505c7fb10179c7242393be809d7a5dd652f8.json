Legal expert weighs in", "language": "en", "text": "Adnan\u2019s still serving his sentence for the murder of Hae Min Lee\n\nSerial podcast subject Adnan Syed suffered perhaps the biggest setback in his appeals case this year, when his conviction for the murder of Hae Min Lee was reinstated.\n\nThe 39-year-old has been serving a life sentence for the murder of his high school girlfriend since 2000 when he was aged 18.\n\nNext year will mark 20 years since Adnan\u2019s conviction and those still interested in the complex murder case are wondering if he\u2019s any closer to getting a new trial.\n\nSky Crime\u2019s critically-acclaimed series, The Case Against Adnan Syed, gave hope with revelations about new evidence, such as DNA testing.\n\nBut will it actually make a difference to Adnan\u2019s appeals case?\n\nColin Miller is a co-host of Adnan Syed podcast Undisclosed and is close friends with Rabia Chaudry, the woman who brought Adnan\u2019s case to the masses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone who knows every fact there is to know about the case, it\u2019s Colin who has spent the past five years conducting painstaking research in hopes of getting Adnan out of prison.\n\nAdnan had his conviction reinstated in March (Picture: Barbara Haddock Taylor/The Baltimore Sun via AP)\n\nNext Monday (21 October) marks another big milestone in the seemingly never ending journey of Adnan\u2019s appeal.\n\nIt\u2019s the State of Maryland\u2019s deadline to submit a response to the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier ruling that Adnan\u2019s conviction should be reinstated.\n\nColin, associate dean and professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Assuming [the state] don\u2019t ask for a delay, we should know probably within the next month or two, whether the Supreme Court agrees to hear his case.\u2019\n\nBut there\u2019s a strong possibility the current stage of Adnan\u2019s appeal won\u2019t go any further at all due to the shocking process of the Supreme Court.\n\nAccording to Colin: \u2018The way the way it works in the United States is the Supreme Court does not hear the vast majority of appeals that they\u2019re asked to hear.\n\n\u2018They hear less than 1% of the actual case.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018And so at this point Adnan and his team are just trying to get the Supreme Court to agree to hear the case, and that\u2019s what\u2019s being decided now. If they do, then there will be briefs filed by both sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There will be arguments before the justices, but it\u2019s highly likely, unfortunately, at this point that the courts won\u2019t even agree to hear his appeal in the case.\u2019\n\nAdnan\u2019s conviction being reinstated by the State of Maryland back in March was a devastating blow to his family and legal team, after he had been granted a retrial in 2018.\n\nThe current appeal focuses on the ineffective assistance of counsel from Adnan\u2019s former lawyer Cristina Guttierez, for allegedly failing to contact potential alibi witness Asia McClain.\n\nAsia has always maintained that she saw Adnan in the school library at the time the state claim Hae was murdered.\n\nBut Colin is optimistic about other avenues of getting Adnan a trial, as he explains: \u2018He has a few other options.\n\n\u2018If you watch the Sky Crime series, there was DNA testing on some of the crime scene evidence. And one of them turned up a DNA profile for an identified female, so there could be additional DNA testing that might point in another direction.\n\n\u2018However, there\u2019s another procedure he can use now if the Supreme Court rules against him to get that back in court and Maryland\u2019s to get the court to consider the substance of his cell tower pain claims. So there\u2019s a few different options he has if the Supreme Court decides not to hear his case.\u2019\n\nHae Min Lee was killed in January 1999 (Picture: Woodlawn High School)\n\nAdnan\u2019s chances of presenting new evidence in his appeal is thanks to Maryland\u2019s writ of actual innocence, which says that if there is something new uncovered that wasn\u2019t able to be presented before and shows the innocence of an individual, they\u2019re allowed to use that to petition for a new trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So if someone else confessed or Jay Wilds, for instance, recanted his testimony against Adnan, those would be the types of things would allow for what\u2019s known as a petition for writ of actual innocence,\u2019 Colin said.\n\nAlthough they aren\u2019t currently focusing on the several inconsistencies in the account of the state\u2019s star witness Jay Wilds, Colin explains that he\u2019ll be an option if their current appeal hits a wall.\n\nThe legal expert said: \u2018If this appeals to the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t go through it\u2019s sort of back to the drawing board to consider all options and one of those options will be trying to reach out to him and get him to recant.\n\nColin says Adnan hasn\u2019t exhausted his appeals just yet (Picture: Syed Family / Courtesy HBO)\n\n\u2018There are ways you can do that so it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re pressuring the witness.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Currently, if the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, it\u2019s just going to be the alibi issue.\n\n\u2018If the Supreme Court does not agree to hear the case, I think both the DNA and the cell tower issue would be prime candidates for making arguments to the courts in Maryland.\u2019\n\nThe entire process seems exhausting for all involved \u2013 including Hae\u2019s family who believe in Adnan\u2019s guilt \u2013 but Colin is determined to fight as far as the justice system will allow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We know it takes years but we\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u2019 Colin explained.\n\n\u2018Oftentimes there are hopes and expectations, that get dashed but then you keep fighting and eventually sometimes justice comes so, not exhausted at all.\u2019\n\nThe Case Against Adnan Syed is available to watch on Sky Crime.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
