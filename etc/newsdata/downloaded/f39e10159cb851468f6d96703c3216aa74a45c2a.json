Tonight, Sinead continued to process the news, while also making final preparations before time runs out \u2014 something which ultimately allowed her to forgive Daniel.\n\nDuring last night\u2019s episode, Daniel couldn\u2019t shake his guilty feelings, and he struggled to make eye contact with Sinead as a result of what he did.\n\nWhile he deliberated over whether or not to tell his dying wife the truth, Sinead attempted to make a list of things she\u2019d like to take with her to the hospice, but while doing so she stumbled upon Bethany\u2019s notebook, and proceeded to read her short story.\n\nAfterwards, Sinead became convinced that Bethany had feelings for Daniel, and thus she asked him if this was the case. Eventually, Daniel came clean about the kiss \u2014 leaving Sinead devastated. After being kicked out, Daniel proceeded to get drunk before collapsing by the canal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTonight \u2014 knowing that she doesn\u2019t have much time left \u2014 Sinead decided to record special messages on Daniel\u2019s laptop for Bertie, in an attempt to highlight just how much she loves him.\n\nDaniel eventually showed up at the Barlow household, and as a result, Tracy (Kate Ford) paid Sinead a visit to let her know about her husband\u2019s self-destructive actions. Tracy then reminded Sinead of how much Bertie needs his father.\n\nDaniel later arrived up at the flat \u2014 and Sinead revealed that the worst thing is that she doesn\u2019t have time to let this situation play out the natural way. In other words, she doesn\u2019t have time for an argument, and thus she ultimately decided to forgive Daniel, before informing him that he now needs to forgive himself.\n\nHe promised that he\u2019d always put Bertie first, and the couple embraced, before Sinead told her husband that he is \u2014 and always will be \u2014 her home.\n\nCoronation Street continues Friday 25thOctober at 7:30pm.\n\nMORE: What day does Sinead die in Coronation Street?\n\nMORE: 10 Coronation Street spoilers: Baby disaster, stabbing twist and collapse\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sinead came to a realisation and thus decided to forgive her husband.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/daniel-osbourne-and-sinead-tinker-in-coronation-street_1571912584.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
