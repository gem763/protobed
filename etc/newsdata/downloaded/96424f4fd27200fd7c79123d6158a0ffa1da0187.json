The game was paused as the public address announcer congratulated DeLyser for breaking the national high school record by scoring her 317th career goal. DeLyser's coach \u2014 and cousin \u2014 Lori DeLyser presented her with a framed poster recognizing the accomplishment. It was a moment most in attendance on that chilly Tuesday evening will remember for a long time.\n\nSeveral media outlets, including the Democrat and Chronicle, immediately reported on the accomplishment. It's not every day that a Section V athlete sets a national record, after all.\n\nApparently it wasn't that day, either.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bruce Howard, director of publications and communications for the National Federation of State High School Associations, began reaching out to the New York State Public High School Athletic Association and members of the media to inform them that the organization would not recognize DeLyser's achievement as the national high school record.\n\nThe reason? Her 319 career varsity goals (she scored a total of five on Tuesday) have been scored over the course of six seasons. DeLyser made the Marion varsity as a seventh-grader and scored 66 goals as a seventh- and eighth- grader and is at 257 (and counting) for grades 9-12.\n\nThe key words for the NFHS are \"high school.\" In an email on Thursday, Howard cited the National High School Sports Record Book, which states, \"A student shall not have the privilege of participating in the same interscholastic sport for more than four seasons in a four-year school or three seasons in a three-year school. A student shall be allowed one competitive season per school year in a sport for record consideration.\"\n\nHistory. Chloe Delyser breaks the all-time national high school girls soccer goal scoring record with her 317th career goal @DandC@SBradleyDCpic.twitter.com/4oQd02UmgW \u2014 Zachary Memmott (@ZacharyMemmott) October 15, 2019\n\nSuffice it to say, this didn't go over well in Marion.\n\n\"We are choosing to place Chloe's inarguable accomplishment of scoring more goals than any other female soccer player in the country before any arbitrary technicalities that would say otherwise,\" reads part of a statement issued by Marion Principal Nick Ganster and Lori DeLyser, who is also the school's athletic director. \"In our hearts and in the hearts of many others across our region and state, Chloe has broken the national record and is deserving of the recognition.\"\n\nBut did she?\n\nThe NFHS recognizes Esmeralda Gonzales of South Hills High School in Fort Worth, Texas, and the 316 goals she scored in four seasons from 2013-16 as the national high school record holder.\n\nHowever, the Missouri High School Athletic Association lists Kassi Ginther, who played at Summit Christian Academy from 2014-17, as its all-time goal-scoring leader with 319, the same number of goals DeLyser has scored for Marion.\n\nGinther, who is now a junior on the Iowa State women's team, scored her 319 goals in 87 games, including 130 in her senior season, according to the MHSAA website. Ginther is not listed on the NFHS site.\n\nHoward said the normal procedure for recognition in the record book is for a school district to fill out an electronic form that is sent to the state association for approval and validation and then sent to the NFHS for review and inclusion. Given what has transpired this week, Howard said his organization would be reaching out to state high school administrators in Missouri to see if Ginther should be at the top of the NFHS list.\n\nMarion senior Chloe DeLyser scored her 317th career goal on this shot against Gananda on Oct. 15, 2019.

You see, the New York State Public High School Athletic Association, which governs high school sports in New York, bases its records on varsity participation.\n\n\"It's goals scored, points scored, whatever statistics are compiled,\" said Chris Watson, director of communications for NYSPHSAA said on Thursday afternoon.\n\nSo the goals DeLyser scored as a varsity player while in junior high school count in New York, as do the 434 points Syracuse basketball freshman Joseph Girard III scored as an eighth-grader for Glens Falls. Girard ended his career as New York's all-time leading scorer in boys basketball with 4,763 points in five seasons, including 4,329 in grades 9-12, which would rank 10th on the NFHS website. DeLyser's high school total of 253 goals would rank third on the NFHS site.\n\nWhile this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that state and national organizations do things differently, it does underscore a longtime reality in high school sports: inconsistent record keeping.\n\nHoward said NFHS defines high school as grades 9-12, and allowing players to accumulate statistics beforehand isn't fair when most states don't allow athletes to participate in varsity high school sports before they reach ninth grade. He has worked at NFHS for 34 years and said issues with records like this have come up from \"time to time\" but are not a common occurrence.\n\nHigh school statistics by nature are subjective. One softball team may score a play a hit, while another scores it an error. Football teams rarely tally the same individual statistics as their opponents do at the end of a game, and there isn't a hockey player born who won't tell you they've been shorted an assist or three.\n\nTeams also don't play the same number of games, and this is true from school to school and state to state. Teams that make deep playoff runs also play more games, giving the athletes on those teams more opportunities. Those games can add up over the course of four \u2014 or six \u2014 years.\n\nHigh school records are only as valid as the people keeping them, and as Watson points out, \"there is no statute of limitations.\" If someone produces proof that a record was set several years ago, that record is often vetted, added and recognized.\n\nMarion's Chloe DeLyser, right, celebrates with Scarlett Keppen after DeLyser scored her 317th career goal during a regular season game against Gananda at Gananda High School, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019. Marion beat Gananda 7-0. (Photo: ADRIAN KRAUS)\n\nAthletes don't play against the same level of competition, either. Marion is a Class C school with fewer than 50 students in its senior class, and DeLyser is a Division I athlete who will attend Ohio State University.\n\nShe outclasses most of the players she competes against in high school, and there are some people who believe her total has been padded by scoring too many goals late in lopsided games. Would her numbers be the same if she played every game against Class A and AA teams in Monroe County? Probably not, but she proved in a game against Victor earlier this month (1 goal, 1 assist in a 5-3 loss) that she can compete on any field.\n\nAll of those variables make high school sports what they are \u2014 a place where things aren't always fair and life lessons can be learned. Records are nice, but in the end most people who play high school sports forget the scores, records and other things that seem so important in the moment. But for the rest of their lives, they usually remember their teammates and the fleeting time they had together.\n\nMarion closed its regular season on Friday night with a 10-0 win over Sodus with DeLyser registering four goals and four assists to pass Ginther and bring her career total to 323.\n\nShe'll add to her total in sectionals and do her best to help her team make a run at her ultimate goal: a state Class C championship.\n\nNo girl is currently on record as having scored more goals for her high school team than DeLyser did in her time at Marion, and not having her name listed in a record book isn't going to change that. As Howard told me in a phone conversation on Friday morning, \"congratulations are certainly in order.\"\n\nAnd the's right. Whether DeLyser finishes with 257 goals, 323 goals, 330 goals or more doesn't really matter at this point. Her career is worth celebrating, and local soccer fans should take advantage of the opportunity to watch her play while they still can.", "description": "Chloe DeLyser scored varsity goals 317, 318 and 319 on Tuesday, but her career scoring mark won't be recognized as an official high school record.", "authors": ["Steve Bradley", "Published A.M.
