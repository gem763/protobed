While the momentous launch has been otherwise successful for SpaceX, the crash means that SpaceX still has yet to recover a center core from any of its Falcon Heavy launches.\n\nBefore the launch, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called this the \u201cmost difficult launch ever.\u201d The Falcon Heavy was tasked with carrying 24 satellites into space, delivering them to four different orbits. The complicated mission has especially high stakes for the company, and was designed to prove to the Air Force that they are capable of carrying out national security missions in the future.\n\nAfter a smooth takeoff, the Falcon Heavy\u2019s boosters separated and headed back to Earth. The two side boosters \u2014 which had also flown during the last Falcon Heavy launch in April \u2014 stuck their landings on SpaceX\u2019s two landing pads at Cape Canaveral. The center core attempted a more difficult landing, aiming for the drone ship \u2018Of Course I Still Love You\u2019 stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. It missed the drone ship, with the live stream showing the rocket coming in for a landing, zooming past the landing pad, followed by a fireball erupting in the distance.\n\nTo date, SpaceX has not successfully recovered a center core from a Falcon Heavy launch. During the first launch, the rocket ran out of fuel and similarly slammed into the ocean. On the second launch, the booster managed to land on the drone ship, but fell overboard in rough waters.\n\nLuckily for SpaceX, successfully landing the booster on a drone ship is not considered an integral part of the mission. Actually delivering the payloads to their respective orbits is a much bigger priority for the company. The deployment of the satellites, many carrying scientific experiments, is expected to take about six hours.", "description": "The center core of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket crashed into the ocean as it attempted to land on a drone ship early on June 25.", "authors": ["Mary Beth Griggs", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFN1AdxWaluWtts9GNjgPHWQz4k=/0x83:1348x789/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16615186/Center_Core_Crash.png", "published_at": "2019-06-25"}
