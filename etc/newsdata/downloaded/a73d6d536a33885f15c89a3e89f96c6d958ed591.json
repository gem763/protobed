It is lucky we\u2019re not residing there!\u2019\n\nThe blast lasted for roughly 300,000 years \u2013 which is a long time for a human but nothing in cosmic terms.\n\n\u2018These results dramatically change our understanding of the Milky Way,\u2019 said Magda Guglielmo from the University of Sydney.\n\n\u2018We always thought about our Galaxy as an inactive galaxy, with a not so bright centre. These new results instead open the possibility of a complete reinterpretation of its evolution and nature.\n\n\u2018The flare event that occurred three million years ago was so powerful that it had consequences on the surrounding of our Galaxy. We are the witness to the awakening of the sleeping beauty.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSagitarrius A is the nearest supermassive hole to Earth and is usually more of a slumbering beast than a ravenous monster.\n\nBut it woke earlier this year and and went into a feeding frenzy.\n\nScientists were astonished to report that it seemed be \u2018getting hungrier\u2019 and was seen wolfing down vast amounts of gas, dust and anything else unfortunate enough to be nearby.\n\n\u2018We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,\u2019 said Andrea Ghez, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and a co-senior author of the research exposing the behemoths monumental appetite.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet. We don\u2019t know what is driving this big feast.\u2019\n\nAstronomers carried out 13,000 observations of the supermassive black hole on 133 different night since 2013.\n\nIllustration of the supermassive black hole swallowing a star (Image: Nicolle Fuller/ National Science Foundation)\n\nEarlier this year, it was spotted glowing twice as brightly as usual, with the strange light emanating outside its \u2018point of no return\u2019 beyond which no matter can escape.\n\nThis change was \u2018unprecedented\u2019, Ghez said, but it\u2019s not known whether the colossus is about to start gorging itself or if the glow was caused by a large one-off meal of gas and dust.\n\n\u2018The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase \u2013 for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole \u201cdrain\u201d has increased for an extended period \u2013 or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,\u2019 said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the paper\u2019s co-senior author.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStargazers will continue to observe the monster and try to work out whether its ravenous greed will grow and grow.\n\n\u2018We want to know how black holes grow and affect the evolution of galaxies and the universe,\u2019 Ghez added.\n\n\u2018We want to know why the supermassive hole gets brighter and how it gets brighter.\u2019\n\nHere's a timelapse of images over 2.5 hr from May from @keckobservatory of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. The black hole is always variable, but this was the brightest we've seen in the infrared so far. It was probably even brighter before we started observing that night! pic.twitter.com/MwXioZ7twV \u2014 Tuan Do (@quantumpenguin) August 11, 2019\n\nThe black hole was spotted glowing strangely over four nights in April and May by astronomers at at the Keck Observatory.\n\nIts brightness aways varies somewhat, but the scientists were \u2018stunned by the extreme variations\u2019.\n\nBlack holes do not shine, because not even light can escape their greedy maw.\n\nBut the gas, dust and other material surrounding them is often heated up and tugged around by gravity until it glows. This effect can be seen vividly in the first-ever image of a black hole, which was captured earlier this year.\n\nThis is the first-ever image of a black hole (Picture: Event Horizon Telescope)\n\nThere are several possible explanations for the hole\u2019s strange behaviour.\n\nIt could have sucked gas from the surface of a star called S0-2, which zoomed past last summer and let loose a mighty belch of gas which may have just reached Sagittarius A*.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother possibility involves a \u2018bizarre object\u2019 known as G2, which is probably a pair of binary stars (systems made of two stars orbiting each other).\n\nThis strange system made a close approach to the black hole in 2014 and it\u2019s possible the dark destroyer sucked gas from the stars.\n\nIt may even have swallowed up a load of asteroids.\n\n\u2018The first image I saw that night, the black hole was so bright I initially mistook it for the star S0-2, because I had never seen Sagittarius A* that bright,\u2019 said UCLA research scientist Tuan Do, the study\u2019s lead author.\n\n\u2018But it quickly became clear the source had to be the black hole, which was really exciting.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re glad to report that no matter how hungry Sagitarrius A* becomes, it is highly unlikely to eat Earth because it\u2019s a whopping 25,640 light-years away.\n\nDo said the radiation would have to be 10 billion times as bright as what the astronomers detected to affect life on Earth.", "description": "The dark beast lurking at our galaxy's heart is currently slumbering and we'd better hope it stays asleep.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-05-at-19.27.36-193f_1570312050.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
