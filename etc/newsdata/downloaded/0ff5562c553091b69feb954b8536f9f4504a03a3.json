The sheriff\u2019s office said it assisted the U.S. Marshall\u2019s Service in capturing the fugitives.\n\nThe reward for Blane Barksdale, called a \"career criminal\" by authorities, had increased to $25,000 with his addition to the 15 Most Wanted List, officials said earlier this week.\n\nThe Barksdales, both suspects in the April murder of 72-year-old man in Tucson, were being transported from New York to Arizona when they escaped on Aug. 26, authorities said.\n\nThe couple was in a transport van in Utah when they overpowered the two security guards by faking a medical ailment. They then tied up the guards as well as a third inmate who was in the van, said David Gonzales, U.S. Marshal for the District of Arizona, at a news conference Monday.\n\nThe Barksdales then drove the van to Vernon, Arizona, where they obtained a pickup truck from an acquaintance and likely got help from additional people, Gonzales said. After ditching the van, the couple drove off in the pickup truck, according to Gonzales.\n\nThe Barksdales were located following what Gonzales on Monday said was a change in the direction of the investigation from a \"rapid manpower search to an intense fugitive search.\"\n\n\"Instead of having 40, 50 police officers, agents on the ground, we're going to pull back a little bit, reset our investigation, go over other leads,\" Gonzales said Monday, two days before the couple was captured.\n\nABC News' Emily Shapiro contributed to this report.", "description": "Authorities in Arizona say they've captured a fugitive husband and wife couple who've been the subject of an intensive manhunt since escaping custody last month.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/blane-barksdale-flt-rt-ps-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
