In focus: the repurchase agreement (or repo) market, where banks and Wall Street dealers lend to one another overnight to meet day-to-day financing needs.\n\nA lack of available bank reserves to support the interbank lending have led to higher interest rates. The New York Fed stepped in on Tuesday morning, overcoming technical difficulties to offer the first repo program of substantial size since 2008.\n\n\u201cSustained [federal funds] pressure will likely raise questions about the Fed\u2019s ability to control money markets, especially as federal funds approach the upper end of the Fed\u2019s target range,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote Tuesday morning, when the effective interest rate was right at 2.25%.\n\nBut others said concerns over Fed credibility may be overblown, as the spike in interest rates appears to be the result of a temporary flurry of financing needs associated with the timing of corporate tax payments and Treasury auctions.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during the \"The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\" panel discussion hosted by the Swiss Institute of International Studies at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland September 6, 2019. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More\n\nTo address the short-term crunch, the New York Fed\u2019s trading desk announced that it would supply some liquidity by buying up to $75 billion in repurchase agreements, in which the bank buys up Treasury and federal agency debt and sells them back when the repo expires.\n\nThe desk originally planned to carry out the operation at 9:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, but \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d delayed the repo program by about 25 minutes.\n\nThe auction ended up generating about $53 billion in agreements. On Wednesday morning the New York Fed re-opened its large repo facility (on time) and auctioned the maximum amount of agreements at $75 billion. With funding pressures expected through at least the rest of the month, the Fed could continue to rely on its short-term funding facility to relieve pressures on interest rates.\n\nThe wonky episode adds another wrinkle to the Fed\u2019s looming decision on interest rates, as policymakers prepare the next moves on interest rates this afternoon.\n\nNomura\u2019s Lewis Alexander wrote Wednesday that the repo crunch will nudge the Fed to move \u201csooner rather than later\u201d and possibly restart growth in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet to support more bank reserves in the system.\n\nWhy the spike?\n\nThe repo market provides critical short-term cash for dealers to finance Treasuries and other securities, making these overnight loans the \u201cplumbing\u201d of the U.S. financial system.\n\nIn the case of spiking repo market rates, borrowers appear to be pressured by corporate tax payments and settlement of newly auctioned U.S. Treasuries. With bank reserves hard to come by, some dealers were paying as much as 10% for repo agreements on Tuesday.\n\nAll Markets Summit More\n\nThe Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the Fed\u2019s measure of the cost of overnight borrowing collateralized by Treasuries, skyrocketed from 2.20% on Friday to 5.25% this week.\n\nThe liquidity crunch was anticipated by some shops on Wall Street. Bank of America Merrill Lynch had warned that the due date on corporate tax payments would pull $75 billion to $100 billion out of funding markets. All the while, the U.S. government is hoping to fill its Treasury general account (TGA) by funding $155 billion of debt over the course of September.\n\n\u201cThe TGA rebuild today represents a large reserve drain and the withdrawal of this cash from money markets has materially tightened funding,\u201d BAML wrote Sept. 17.", "description": "The Federal Reserve scrambled to regain control of interest rates as repo markets faced a liquidity crunch.", "authors": ["Brian Cheung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8xZGRWF4pSX93qAoYgq60Q--~B/aD0zMjUzO3c9NDg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/04891f00-d97f-11e9-a7f7-789f11547897", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
