It was never in New York until Hurricane Sandy. It\u2019s also called \u2018mile-a-minute\u2019 because it grows so fast \u2014 it can grow six inches in a day.\u201d Koepp has been battling the invasive weed at his summer house in Amagansett. \u201cThe roots are horrifying. They\u2019ll run like ten feet sideways through the soil. These \u2014\u201d he says, referencing the scratches, \u201c\u2014 are from before I figured out you need to wear long sleeves and long pants.\u201d\n\nKoepp, who\u2019s 56, has spent the last 30 years as one of the most successful screenwriters in Hollywood; among his three dozen or so high-profile credits are Jurassic Park, Carlito\u2019s Way, Panic Room, the first Mission: Impossible, and Steven Spielberg\u2019s War of the Worlds remake. (This may help explain the summer house in Amagansett.) Tall and thin, with more than a passing resemblance to Matthew Modine, Koepp displays a classic Midwesterner\u2019s wry mien, and his biography is so capital M Midwestern that, if he were a character in one of his own movies, his backstory might seem too on-the-nose. He grew up in the 1970s in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, the son of a therapist (his mother) and a billboard-company owner (his father).\n\nDuring that formative age, \u201cfrom 14 to 24, when all your tastes are shaped,\u201d he recalls lying around on his family couch, falling in love with all his now-favorite films and books. The films? The Bad and the Beautiful, for one, but basically everything that came out between 1979 and 1982: Alien, Being There, Kramer vs. Kramer, The Empire Strikes Back, The Shining, Raging Bull, John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing, E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Altered States. And the books? \u201cThere were two authors that were really big for me, Stephen King and Kurt Vonnegut.\u201d The latter was a chance discovery, but an all-important one: \u201cI picked up Player Piano at random because I liked the cover, so I sort of lucked into the one author who was considered great literature and also wrote in science-fiction. I think I developed a humanist viewpoint thanks to Vonnegut and [Doonesbury cartoonist] Gary Trudeau.\u201d\n\nThis set Koepp on the slightly crooked path of becoming a humanist-horror fan, leading him from Wisconsin to UCLA and, eventually, Hollywood. Humanist horror is also a pretty good description of his first novel, the thriller Cold Storage, which is out today. Along with the aforementioned killer fungus, it features a bunch of very scared humans. Christened cordyceps novus, the fungus is a fictional spore that mutated in outer space, came back on the crashed space station Skylab, hibernated for decades in the Australian outback, and is about to devour the world. As you might expect from the screenwriter of Jurassic Park and Mission: Impossible, the novel starts with a grandiosely cinematic set piece: Grizzled military operatives approach Australia in a transport plane, accompanied by an attractive scientist playfully named \u201cHero,\u201d and encounter a scene of nauseating horror and \u2014 well, this is the beginning of the book, not the end, so let\u2019s just say they do not initially succeed at wiping out the fungus.\n\nWhat happens next, though, is not what you\u2019d expect from the screenwriter of Jurassic Park and Mission: Impossible. Rather than race full speed into global eco-horror, with obligatory pit stops in world capitals and secret Pentagon war rooms, the novel instead becomes a claustrophobic and genuinely touching story of two hapless low-level employees \u2014 a security guard nicknamed Teacake and a single mother named Naomi \u2014 who are stuck as wage slaves in a storage facility in rural Kansas. One night they hear a strange beeping just behind the wall and, being bored, decide to investigate \u2014 to their eventual regret.\n\nDavid Koepp. Photo: Melissa Thomas\n\nFor Koepp, it was both a pleasure and a relief to escape the increasingly stringent rules of blockbuster screenwriting \u2014 not to mention the cavalcade of intrusive producers\u2019 notes that any big-budget film entails. \u201cI found this really deeply satisfying in a way that movies can be only rarely,\u201d he explains. \u201cMovies, at best, even if you write and direct it, you\u2019re part of something that\u2019s highly dependent on other people having a good day at work.\u201d Screenwriters are primarily responsible for producing a blueprint for a finished film, leaving little room for whimsical detours or, really, anything that doesn\u2019t keep the narrative rocketing along. \u201cI was fascinated by being able to digress!\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, 30 years of screenwriting do something to you that you can\u2019t undo, so the novel moves pretty quickly. But as a writer you\u2019re really able to lose yourself in a way that you can\u2019t in a script because you can go inside somebody\u2019s head. Also, I like solitude. And you certainly get a lot of that.\u201d\n\nThe notes he got from his editor \u201cwere so gentle and intelligent,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, This can\u2019t be! I\u2019ve never had that experience [in screenwriting]. Some people are nicer than others, some people are more encouraging than others, but no one views the script as essentially yours. They view it as essentially theirs.\u201d The novel, he realized, was essentially his.\n\nThis, of course, is slightly terrifying as well, as there\u2019s no one else to hide behind if it doesn\u2019t land. Being a successful screenwriter definitely helps you to, say, sell your novel, and it definitely helps sell the screen adaptation of your novel, which Koepp already has done, and will write himself. But it also comes with a potential downside. As he worked on the novel, he says, \u201cThere were two things I was afraid of. One was, to spend a really long time on it and not even get it in print. The other is public humiliation, which I never enjoy.\u201d He chuckles. He\u2019s Midwestern. \u201cI\u2019ve had my share of it. Movies are a public thing. And I know that \u2018screenwriter with some hit movies who tries to write a novel\u2019 is not \u2026\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish the thought, but refers instead to a scene from Jack London\u2019s novel The Sea Wolf, in which a cook, hoping to intimidate a young boy, simply sits on a nearby stool and sharpens his knives on a whetstone. \u201cThat\u2019s how I picture what\u2019s coming,\u201d he says. (A recent rave in the New York Times may have allayed his anxieties.)\n\nThe desire to write a novel was precipitated in part by the fact that, as tends to happen over 30 years, Hollywood has changed since he arrived, and so has he. The studios of today are much more likely to reboot a franchise like Jurassic Park than to green-light the next Jurassic Park, let alone a movie like Kramer vs. Kramer. \u201cWhen I came up in the early \u201990s, most studios made 25 to 30 movies a year,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is no breaking news, but now the middle is largely gone. As a screenwriter, if you don\u2019t particularly want to work on a superhero movie or a Star Wars movie, you\u2019ve just eliminated 70 percent of studio development. And I like those movies! I\u2019ve done those kind of movies! But I don\u2019t want to do them forever and my interests are a little different now.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his screenwriting work, Koepp has directed six feature films \u2014 in fact, he\u2019s finishing one up right now \u2014 none of which have been huge hits, some of which have done well \u201cand I\u2019ve been proud of\u201d and one of which was \u201ca spectacular bomb in all ways imaginable, financial, critical, commercial.\u201d I ask him to clarify. He answers wryly, \u201cI don\u2019t say its name anymore.\u201d (If you check out his IMDb page you can probably make an educated guess.) \u201cAll of us miscalculated,\u201d he says of that project. \u201cYou don\u2019t do it on purpose! People get really mad when a movie\u2019s bad. I swear, we don\u2019t do it to irritate you. I always thought the perfect wrap-party gift would be a T-shirt that says, \u2018It seemed like a good idea at the time.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s enjoyed the novel writing experience so far \u2014 \u201cthose were great days at the office\u201d \u2014 which is fortunate because he\u2019s already under contract to write another one, a similar thriller that isn\u2019t, however, a Cold Storage sequel. Not that he\u2019s completely exhausted his fascination with killer botany. There\u2019s still Asiatic tearthumb to defeat. \u201cI\u2019d like to do a movie about a 78-year-old guy who fights the vines in his backyard,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd make that a horror movie. When he pulls the vine out of the tree, there\u2019s a mouth attached to the end of it.\u201d He\u2019s joking \u2014 sort of. No sooner has he proposed the idea than he pauses and, as an earnest aside, adds, \u201cThat might be kind of fun.\u201d", "description": "David Koepp, a veteran screenwriters of films including Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible, Carlito\u2019s Way, and Panic Room, enjoyed the freedom of writing his first novel, Cold Storage, a thriller about a killer fungus from outer space.", "authors": ["Adam Sternbergh"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/03/03-david-koepp-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
