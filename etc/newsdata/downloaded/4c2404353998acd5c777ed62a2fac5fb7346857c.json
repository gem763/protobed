These areas face a triple threat of \u201cdestructive winds, flooding rains, and life-threatening storm surges,\u201d according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nWhile Dorian stayed far enough off the coast to largely spare Florida from the worst of its wrath, it is forecast to make a much closer approach to the coastline of the Carolinas Thursday and Friday and could even make landfall. Impacts are thus expected to be more severe.\n\nIn addition, Dorian has gained some added strength, increasing the risk of storm hazards. It maximum sustained winds are back up to 115 mph, meaning it has regained Category 3 intensity. If it makes landfall in North Carolina, it would be the first Category 3 to strike since Fran in 1996. While intensifying, its wind field has expanded, with tropical-storm and hurricane-force winds covering more territory.\n\n[News updates on Dorian]\n\nThe storm is likely to buffet the entire coastline South Carolina well into Thursday and North Carolina through the first half of Friday.\n\nAround Charleston, S.C., for example, wind gusts could hit 90 mph or so, and water levels could rank among the top five levels ever recorded due to the combination of ocean surge and up to 15 inches of rain. Higher wind gusts up to 100 mph or so could lash North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks.\n\n\u201cLife threatening storm surge with significant coastal flooding is expected along a large portion of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic coasts of the United States during the next couple of days,\u201d the Hurricane Center stated in their 11 p.m. advisory.\n\nPower outages and wind damage are likely in many parts of the coastal Carolinas.\n\n[Hurricane Dorian is on track to bring historic coastal flooding to the Carolinas]\n\nEven the Virginia Tidewater and southern Delmarva Peninsula could endure tropical storm conditions by Friday, after which the storm is expected to finally zoom away to the northeast.\n\nBecause the storm has grown larger, it means its strong winds cover a larger area, capable of generating giant waves and pushing large amounts of water toward the shore.\n\nCoastal flooding due to storm surge is a risk from Georgia to Southeast Virginia where a storm-driven rise in water above normally dry land is predicted to reach at least 2 to 4 feet and up to 8 feet. Storm surge warnings cover this entire zone.\n\n[Bahamas lifts Hurricane Dorian storm warnings, assesses \u2018catastrophic\u2019 destruction]\n\nThe latest\n\nAs of 11 p.m. on Wednesday, the storm was 105 miles south of Charleston, S.C., and moving north at 7 mph.\n\nThe Hurricane Center wrote in its latest bulletin that Dorian was \u201ca little better organized with a clear eye surrounded by a ring of very deep convection.\u201d The storm\u2019s peak sustained winds are up to 115 mph, a 10 mph increase from earlier in the day, making it once again a major Category 3 storm.\n\nDorian is expected to maintain its current intensity into Thursday, before a slow weakening trend begins.\n\nThe storm has grown steadily larger since the weekend and this trend is expected to continue. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles. (Earlier today tropical-storm-force winds extended outward 170 miles).\n\nOn Wednesday night, radar showed Dorian\u2019s outer rain bands bringing heavy rain and strong winds in the coastal zone from near Jacksonville, Fla. to southeast North Carolina. The National Weather Service wrote that rainfall rates in coastal South Carolina could reach three inches per hour causing flashing flooding.\n\nBouts of tropical-storm-force winds expanded over much of the Georgia and southern South Carolina coast:\n\nDuring the afternoon, scenes from social media in northeast Florida showed water due to storm surge running up to homes in Vilano Beach and flooding streets around St. Augustine:\n\nStreet flooding continues along A1A and coastal roads near the east coast.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude97 Please try to stay off the roads and if you must drive, don't drive into flooded roads- find an alternative route. https://t.co/UvvWr4Rs2Q \u2014 NWS Jacksonville (@NWSJacksonville) September 4, 2019\n\nThe waves are reaching the sea wall in Vilano Beach.

In North Carolina, it may take until Thursday morning for tropical storm conditions to commence although gusty showers are already developing. Most of the storm effects in southeastern Virginia should hold off until late Thursday night or Friday morning.\n\n[Hurricane Dorian takes aim at the Southeast coast: City-by-city forecasts]\n\nThe severity of Dorian\u2019s effects will be closely related to how closely Dorian tracks to the coast and whether it makes landfall. Most computer models now forecast the center of Dorian to come very close to the coast of South Carolina and to come ashore in North Carolina, with the highest chance over the Outer Banks.\n\nComputer models generally project that the storm center should remain far enough off the coast of Georgia to limit winds to tropical-storm force (39 to 73 mph) and rainfall totals to 2 to 4 inches. Tropical storm warnings are in effect here.\n\nIn the coastal Carolinas, under hurricane warnings, sustained winds could reach 60 to 80 mph with gusts over 100 mph, highest along the North Carolina Outer Banks Friday morning. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches are predicted, and localized totals up to 15 inches, meaning a high risk of flash flooding.\n\n\n\nPredicted hourly peak wind gusts from Hurricane Dorian in the Southeast between 8 p.m. Wednesday and 8 p.m. Friday night from National Weather Service. Labeled times on image are Universal - subtract four hours for eastern daylight time. (WeatherBell.com)\n\nThe Georgia and South Carolina coastlines are particularly vulnerable to storm surge flooding, even from a storm that does not make landfall, due to the shape of the land on and just offshore, as well as the effects of sea-level rise and land subsidence over time. The surge could reach 3 to 5 feet in Georgia and 5 to 8 feet from the Isle of Palms to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. From Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds and the Neuse and Pamlico Rivers. a surge of 4 to 6 ft is anticipated.\n\nFarther north, the possibility of a 2-to-4-foot surge exists in Hampton Roads, Va.\n\nHere's the updated #Dorian storm surge forecast from the 5 pm advisory. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide.

Heavy rains of 6 to 10 inches or more could worsen the surge-related flooding by impeding drainage back out to sea.\n\nThe @NWSWPC has issued a High Risk area for flash flooding over eastern South Carolina & SE North Carolina for Thursday due to #Dorian. Very heavy rainfall totals of up 15 inches are possible.

This map does not include flooding due to heavy rainfall. (The Lowcountry Hazards Center at the College of Charleston, Dr. Norman S. Levine in collaboration with the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium)\n\nFort Pulaski, Georgia, near Savannah, is forecast to have coastal flooding at midday Wednesday that would be exceeded only by Hurricanes Matthew and Irma, while Charleston may see a 2nd-worst flood event, behind 1989\u2032s Hurricane Hugo, on Wednesday night.\n\nThe center of #Dorian may still be off the FL coast, but impactful coastal #flooding at high tides today/tonight in GA/SC.\n\n\n\n-Ft.

Among the possible effects, it listed: \u201cLarge areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\u201d\n\nLocations farther north from Virginia Beach to the southern Delmarva are expected to be scraped by the storm Friday and Friday night, with heavy rains, tropical storm force winds and coastal flooding. A tropical storm warning is in effect from the North Carolina-Virginia border to Chincoteague, and for the Chesapeake Bay from Smith Point southward, where 3 to 6 inches of rain are possible along with wind gusts up to 60 mph. The storm surge in this zone could reach to 2 to 4 feet above the normal high tide.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch has been issued from north of Chincoteague, Virginia, to Fenwick Island, Delaware, for the Chesapeake Bay from Smith Point to Drum Point, and for the Tidal Potomac River south of Cobb Island. This area sits along the western edge of where significant wind and rain are possible and may or may not experience tropical-storm conditions.\n\nForecast for Florida\n\nThe center of Dorian passed north of Florida Wednesday night and all watches and warnings were dropped.\n\nNorthwest Bahamas took a nightmarish, 40 hour direct hit\n\nBetween late Sunday and Tuesday, Dorian slammed into the northwestern Bahamas with wind gusts up to 220 mph and a 23-foot storm surge. Video and images emerging from the Bahamas show a toll of absolute devastation on Great Abaco and Grand Bahama Islands, two locations where the eye of the storm made landfall.\n\n[A storm chaser went silent as Dorian hit the Bahamas. He re-emerged with a harrowing story.]\n\nGrand Bahama Island suffered an onslaught from this storm that few places on Earth have experienced, remaining in the eyewall of a major hurricane (between Category 3 and 5) for 40 hours. The eyewall is the most severe part of a hurricane that contains its strongest winds and generates the most destructive storm-surge flooding.\n\n[Dorian\u2019s horrific eyewall slammed Grand Bahama Island for 40 hours straight]\n\nDorian came to a virtual standstill as it encountered the northwest Bahamas. Between 3 a.m. on Labor Day and 5 a.m. on Tuesday, the storm moved just 30 miles in 28 hours. In addition to wind gusts up to 220 mph and a 23-foot storm surge, up to 40 inches of rain were estimated in some areas.\n\n[Sobering scenes emerge showing Hurricane Dorian\u2019s toll in the Bahamas]\n\nDorian\u2019s place in history\n\nDorian is tied for the second-strongest storm (as judged by its maximum sustained winds) ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, behind Hurricane Allen of 1980, and, after striking the northern Bahamas, tied with the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane for the title of the strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall.\n\nIt is only the second Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the Bahamas since 1983, according to Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University. The only other is Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The international hurricane database goes back continuously only to 1983.\n\n[Hurricane Dorian has smashed all sorts of intensity records in the Atlantic Ocean]\n\nThe storm\u2019s peak sustained winds rank as the strongest so far north in the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida on record. Its pressure, which bottomed out at 910 millibars, is significantly lower than Hurricane Andrew\u2019s when it made landfall in South Florida in 1992 (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm).\n\nWith Dorian attaining Category 5 strength, this is the first time since the start of the satellite era (in the 1960s) that Category 5 storms have developed in the tropical Atlantic for four straight years, according to Capital Weather Gang tropical weather expert Brian McNoldy.\n\nThe unusual strength of Dorian and the rate at which it developed is consistent with the expectation of more intense hurricanes in a warming world. Some studies have shown increases in hurricane rapid intensification, and modeling studies project an uptick in the frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms.\n\nDorian may have also set a record for the longest period of Category 4 and 5 conditions to strike one location in the North Atlantic Basin since the dawn of the satellite era, but historical data is relatively sparse.", "description": "The South Carolina and North Carolina coasts face a triple threat of \u2018destructive winds, flooding rains, and life-threatening storm surges\u2019 from the hurricane.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
