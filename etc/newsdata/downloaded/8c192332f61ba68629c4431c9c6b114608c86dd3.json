They did not notice or they were surprised when they learned that a baby was inside the sling bag,\" said Manny Dimaano, of the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), during a news conference on Thursday.\n\nDimaano said that, \"based on the instructions on the bag, it should be carried in front and the head of the baby should be in an upright position so you could see the baby but then it was not carried that way so there was really an intention to conceal and to sneak out the baby, and that is why she was able to pass through the security.\"\n\nWhile officials had originally said she was from Ohio, public records obtained by ABC News Thursday placed her recently in Utah. Records also showed that Talbot had family in Ohio.\n\nTalbot did not declare or present the child to the immigration inspector during departure formalities, the Philippines Bureau of Immigration told ABC News on Thursday. The immigration bureau said that while the agency is tasked with checking passengers' travel documents, bags and luggage are not under its jurisdiction.\n\nTalbot also did not have a passport, travel documents or a boarding pass for the baby, the NBI said. Authorities also said Talbot had allegedly intended to fly back to the U.S. with the baby, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"There was really an intention to hide the baby,\" said immigration official Grifton Medina, according to the AP.\n\nTalbot allegedly told authorities that she wanted to give the baby boy a name and a church blessing, authorities said.\n\nAuralyn Pascual, a deputy spokesperson for the NBI, said the baby was 6 days old, the AP said.\n\nMark R Cristino/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nTalbot was charged Wednesday in Pasay City court with violating the Anti-Trafficking in Person's Act of 2003. The human-trafficking charge carries a life sentence, authorities said.\n\nDimaano said Talbot would remain in the Philippines while the case was under investigation.\n\nShe was also charged with violating at least two other laws on child abuse, kidnapping and illegal detention, authorities said.\n\nThe NBI said the U.S. Embassy had told authorities that Talbot was from Ohio and that she had no derogatory record. It said she'd asked for help from the U.S. Embassy and that the embassy had given her a list of law firms.\n\nAuthorities said that Talbot had allegedly told them that she met the baby's mother via the internet. Based on documents found with Talbot during her arrest at the airport, authorities said, she came from Davao City. The baby is believed to have come from Davao.\n\nAuthorities said the baby's parents had been charged with human trafficking but they were still at large.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation said it had no information on whether the baby had been sold to Talbot.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News Thursday, a spokesperson said the State Department was aware of the reports about Talbot.\n\n\"Due to privacy considerations, we have nothing further at this time. We refer you to local authorities for any further details,\" the State Department said.\n\nDelta Airlines told ABC News that it was fully cooperating with Manila authorities on their investigation.\n\n\"The safety and security of our customers and employees is and always will be Delta\u2019s top priority,\" Delta said.\n\nABC News' Conor Finnegan and Matt Stone contributed to the reporting in this story.", "description": "Authorities said she passed through immigration but was stopped at a Delta boarding gate by airport personnel who had questions about her oversize luggage.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/talbot-1-sh-er-190905_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
