For Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team confidence is boosted after ending J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s leaders perfect league record, while Pep Guardiola\u2019s champions look at the table and see the gap to Liverpool is six points.\n\nYet United\u2019s fourth draw of the season came close to going down as a memorable victory before Adam Lallana\u2019s late equaliser, the substitute sending the travelling support delirious. Their counterparts had enjoyed the same emotion for much of the match, half-time here being greeted by United players sprinting for the dressing room while Liverpool\u2019s slouched off. The differing body language was indicative of what had just unfolded.\n\nTowards the end of the first half two VAR decisions went the way of United, to the chagrin of Klopp. If it was correct to rule that Sadio Man\u00e9 had handled the ball before beating David de Gea, the decision that Victor Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s challenge on Divock Origi should not be enough to rule out Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal was closer.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r and his men had earned the break, though. As United entered this 203rd showdown between English football\u2019s great foes the prevailing question was: could the Norwegian conjure some magic to halt the Liverpool juggernaut. Liverpool\u2019s perfect eight wins had gathered them 24 points, with the fewest goals conceded in the division \u2013 six. Against this, United\u2019s record was alarming: two wins, nine points, and a paltry nine goals to sit just above the drop zone.\n\nLiverpool drop first points but Lallana strike denies Manchester United Read more\n\nThe answer to the poser was clear. Solskj\u00e6r was not going to die wondering as his innovative 3\u20114\u20111\u20112 indicated. If De Gea\u2019s inclusion was a surprise \u2013 his manager had said the goalkeeper was unavailable \u2013 the fielding of a back three, maintained despite Axel Tuanzebe\u2019s injury in the warm-up, was bold as this was its first use this season for United.\n\nAndreas Pereira was deployed as the \u201c1\u201d in the formation, Solskj\u00e6r ordering him to operate behind Daniel James and Rashford and hassle Fabinho, Jo\u00ebl Matip and Virgil van Dijk whenever Liverpool had possession.\n\nPlay Video 1:26 J\u00fcrgen Klopp '100% sure' VAR would overrule Marcus Rashford goal \u2013 video\n\nIt worked. Pereira\u2019s role was United in microcosm: quick across the pitch, and muscular in the challenge. A moment midway through the opening half summed the ploy up.\n\nRashford engaged Van Dijk in a race down United\u2019s right. As the two reached the ball, the slighter Rashford bounced the Uefa player of the year to the turf, turned, and zipped the ball infield. Liverpool scrambled and recovered but the narrative was set.\n\nThe script was possible because of many United players performing to their potential for the first time in a long time. Fred\u2019s inclusion in the XI is these days seen as a near shock because of his poor displays in his two years at the club. There is a view at Old Trafford that Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s failure here derived from him lacking the nerve required to wear United colours.\n\nFred, too, could be accused of the same and this third consecutive start was only because of Paul Pogba\u2019s injury. This display, though, countered the notion. Whether in the tackle, passing, or taking up position, the Brazilian impressed.\n\nAs did Rashford. The finish from James\u2019s pinpoint cross was the No 10 at his best, for a first United goal since 14 September.\n\nKlopp was an unhappy figure throughout, though. The second half had him continuing to berate Jonathan Moss, the fourth official, for perceived injustices. Yet the truth was that beyond the VAR controversy his side were being outplayed. Matip received a rollicking from the manager for poor awareness, followed up moments later by hooking a ball, Sunday League-style, into the heavens.\n\nThe sight of Klopp turning away from the game in disappointment had become a leitmotif of the afternoon. Andy Robertson invoked his ire by booting a pass straight out for a United throw. As Liverpool stared at a first league loss in more than 10 months, Klopp brought on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for Origi and shifted his side to a quasi 4-2-4 that had Jordan Henderson on the right.\n\nTo have Liverpool\u2019s one-paced captain as an auxiliary winger summed up the job United were doing on them. By the close Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men could be disappointed but proud. What fascinates now are the implications of this result in the coming weeks.", "description": "The Manchester United manager played three at the back to frustrate J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side as VAR came to the fore again", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef1f15b6c04dd6d3e7a97d1824f791c64341a59/0_211_3589_2153/master/3589.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d65ac0db3828e8cd83ef8cd2db98b298", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
