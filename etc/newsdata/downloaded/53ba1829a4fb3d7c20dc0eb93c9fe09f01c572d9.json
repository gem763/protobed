Dutch beer company Heineken is a title partner.\n\nThe Ferrari driver has criticised race trophies before now, speaking of the disappointment he felt when some of them were presented.\n\n\u201cI care. I think for me they are part of traditions and when I look back at old pictures I see the old guys lifting the trophies in the different countries,\u201d he said in Hungary last August.\n\n\u201cIf we have the title sponsor trophies on Sunday then that looks super-boring. I don\u2019t get the point either, because you have the billboards everywhere. Why do you need the trophies saying the same thing again?\u201d\n\nVettel was seen pushing away the Mexican mascot as he tried to join him, race winner Lewis Hamilton and the Briton\u2019s Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas in the celebrations.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like the selfie guy when he tried to push into the picture, so I pushed him away,\u201d said Vettel. \u201cI\u2019m not big into selfies anyways.\u201d\n\nThe post-race celebrations, in front of the main stadium grandstand, also had a novel feature with a lift bringing Hamilton\u2019s winning Mercedes onto the podium with him.\n\n\u201cI think it was nice to elevate the car as well,\u201d said Vettel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very nice way to do it, to involve the whole stadium and the crowd and the other things, so I liked most of it. Except the selfie guy and the trophies.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "Ferrari\u2018s Sebastian Vettel has renewed his call for Formula One to have better race trophies after criticising the sponsored one handed to him in Sunday\u2019s Mexican Grand Prix.
