President Trump hailed it as a remarkable victory on Sunday, one that comes after a month of controversy for his decision to withdraw most U.S. forces from Syria.\n\n\u201cLast night, the United States brought the world\u2019s number one terrorist to justice,\u201d Trump said at a much-hyped scheduled address. \u201cHis body was mutilated by the blast.\u201d\n\nThe White House said that American forces were able to nevertheless positively identify the 48-year-old Baghdadi immediately using portable DNA testing equipment and visual evidence facial recognition software they brought with them, and the Special Operations force commander on the ground reported that Baghdadi was dead at 7:15 p.m. Washington, D.C. time.\n\nThe U.S. special operations mission in northwestern Syria was staged from an airbase in western Iraq, a Pentagon official told The Daily Beast. The base had for months housed U.S. troops deployed there, and had more recently become the destination for troops withdrawing from northern Syria after the Trump administration ordered a withdrawal.\n\nU.S. Surveillance Turns Away From ISIS\u2014and to Its Own Troops\n\nThe president said the successful mission was much more important than even the capture and killing of Osama Bin Laden. \u201cBin Laden was big, but this was bigger,\u201d he boasted.\n\nTrump described how special forces executed a \u201cdangerous and daring night time raid\u201d in which American military dogs chased and cornered Baghdadi in a closed tunnel where he detonated his suicide vest killing himself and three of his young children he had taken with him. Trump said he watched the entire mission, noting that \u201cit was just like a movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was whimpering, screaming, crying. He died like a coward.\u201d\n\nOthers ISIS leaders killed in covert operations included spokesman Abu al-Hassan al Muhajir who was killed in a separate raid from Baghdadi, a U.S. official told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cWe never stopped patrolling, we never stopped analyzing intel and developing targets, the official said, noting that U.S. operations were \u201cjust slowed down during the Turkey invasion.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of Baghdadi\u2019s death comes as Trump has sought to fend off scrutiny amid an impeachment inquiry over claims he withheld military aid to Ukraine in a bid to force the country to investigate his political rivals. He has also faced heavy criticism\u2014from both Republicans and Democrats\u2014for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria, a move which sparked fears of a resurgence by ISIS and paved the way for Turkey to attack Washington\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nDuring his announcement, Trump went on to thank Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq along with Syrian Kurds for \u201ccertain support they were able to give us.\u201d Trump elaborated on informing Russians present in Syria. \u201cWe spoke to the Russians, we told them we were coming in. They said thank you for telling us,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t tell them why, only that \u201cyou are going to be very happy.\u201d\n\nThe White House added that other countries with military forces in the region \u201cwere notified that American forces would be moving through the area.\u201d\n\nIn an apparent slight on Democrats, Trump also suggested he withheld briefings on the raid from the senior congressional Democrats on committees involved in the impeachment inquiry, arguing that they could not be trusted to keep the information confidential.\n\n\u201cWe notified some [and] others are being notified now as I speak,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWashington is a leaking machine. The only people that knew were the few people that I dealt with.\u201d\n\nTrump said he didn\u2019t inform House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ahead of time. A House intelligence committee official told the Daily Beast as the President spoke, \u201cWe have not received any notification or briefing.\u201d Adam Schiff, Trump\u2019s foil atop the House intelligence committee, did not receive any briefing on the raid in any venue, according to the official.\n\nThe path to finding Baghdadi began over the summer after the CIA received a tip about general location in a village following the arrest and interrogation of one of Baghdadi\u2019s wives and a courier, The New York Times reported.", "description": "ReutersA raid by U.S. Army special forces led to the death Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi when the leader of the so-called Islamic State detonated a suicide vest after being cornered in a cave in Syria\u2019s Idlib province.
