He is now being held in a London jail awaiting an extradition hearing next year.\n\nMr Assange sought refuge at the embassy after being accused of sexual assault in Sweden.\n\nHis stay is thought to have cost the UK \u00a316million in policing and other expenses. The charity Blueprint for Free Speech told The Times: 'He will fight this as long as it takes.\n\n'That could be all the way to the Supreme Court and to [the European Court of Human Rights in] Strasbourg if need be.'\n\nThe 48-year-old Australian was arrested in April when police dragged him from the embassy. Here he is pictured in a prison van leaving Southwark Crown Court in London in May\n\nIt is thought the US has assured Britain Mr Assange will not face the death penalty if he is extradited.\n\nAt a hearing today the case against him will be set out before a full hearing in February.\n\nBut if the case goes to a series of appeals, Mr Assange could remain in a UK jail until at least 2025.\n\nIt is estimated jail and court costs would run to nearly \u00a3600,000 over that time.\n\nHe is understood to be in solitary confinement now after a video of him taken by an inmate was posted online.", "description": "The 48-year-old Australian was arrested in April when police dragged him from the Ecuadorian embassy.
