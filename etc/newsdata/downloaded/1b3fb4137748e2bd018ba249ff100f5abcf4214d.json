Fred, it's almost becoming a joke when he gets the ball. I know it's good closing down but you've got to be able to control it and pass,\" said Keown on Match of the Day.\n\n\"If that's the central midfield then there's not going to be anything created.\n\n\"They started playing balls long into [Marcus] Rashford and I feel sorry for him because he's surviving on scraps. But he should do better.\n\n\"Look at his body language\u2026 I think he's starting to despair with what's around him.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe added: \"You start to look at where the system is\u2026 where's the intensity? I think the belief is ebbing away and this could be the beginning of the end for this manager.\n\n\"I don't want to see a former player come in and leave the job but there has to be a spark, there has to be a reaction and it seems to just be spiraling out of control. This is a really poor result.\"", "description": "Manchester United were beaten 1-0 by Newcastle on Sunday and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is under increasing pressure", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Bbc", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529292.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BBCScreen-Shot-2019-10-07-at-105644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
