But what if you could give your favorite gadget an actual hug? That\u2019s where pillow company Throwboy comes in, with a Kickstarter for its lineup of \u201cIconic\u201d gadget pillows that look oddly similar to some of Apple\u2019s most famous products over the years.\n\nThrowboy is extremely careful to never mention the words \u201cApple,\u201d \u201cMac,\u201d or \u201ciPhone\u201d anywhere on its Kickstarter page, but the pillows are unmistakable to anyone who\u2019s ever interacted with an Apple product. The line of five pillows are instead just dubbed as the 1977 pillow (Apple II), 1984 pillow (the original Macintosh), 1998 pillow (iMac), 2001 pillow (iPod), and 2007 pillow (iPhone).\n\nThe pillows themselves look like pretty adorable versions of the classic gadgets, with plenty of fun detail work for the ports, logos, buttons, and vents \u2014 although for my money, the Macintosh and iMac ones are the clear winners here.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Throwboy\u2019s first dip into the geeky pillow industry (if that\u2019s a thing), either \u2014 the company was first started ten years ago by founder Roberto Hoyos making pillows shaped like icons on the OS X dock, before later expanding into emoji pillows.\n\nThe Throwboy pillows are available on Kickstarter for $39 with an estimated delivery date of February 2019, with discounted bundles for buying multiple pillows. As always, though, use your own best judgement before backing \u2014 adorable as it may be, it\u2019s still a crowdfunding campaign.", "description": "Give your old gadgets the warm and fuzzy hug they deserve with Throwboy\u2019s lineup of plush pillows designed to resemble classic Apple products like the Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, and iMac", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KwTE02t7gAI5IxHd5Ed_JYCKrJ0=/0x13:680x369/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12188569/91ba634c4f0ab6f13c3734691ee525dd_original.jpeg", "published_at": "2018-08-18"}
