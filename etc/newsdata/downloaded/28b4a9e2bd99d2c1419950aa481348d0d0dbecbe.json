But they also wanted products that would not be tainted with the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that could cause problems for users in certain states.\n\nSo they developed a product set by working with multiple independent laboratories to ensure their products were free of leads, heavy metals and pesticides, the company said. That devotion to purity has led the company to sign agreements with fitness pros like Mat Fraser, Brooke Wells, Tia-Clair Toomey and Mikaela Mayer.\n\nThe company currently sells three lines of products \u2014 cannabinoid-infused oils, which sell for anywhere from $60 to $140; a cannabinoid-infused salve that retails for $60; and protein bars with cannabinoid powders, which cost between $25 and $45. The bars, oils and salve can be sold in every state and ordered online, according to the company.\n\n\u201cAt the high level we look at being a performance wellness company,\u201d says Lombardi.\n\nWhile the cannabis industry is still in its infancy, products infused with newly legal cannabinoids have been surging in the market recently. Not a day goes by that some startup isn\u2019t launching a cannabis-infused brand touting its health and wellness benefits.\n\nBeam looks to differentiate itself through its focus on testing and the purity of its products, along with an approach that\u2019s aimed at the health and fitness market. There will be other products coming down the pike that will increase the company\u2019s focus on tailoring its offerings to meet performance needs, says Lombardi.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re launching some blend products that will be purpose-driven for different use cases,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company has also managed to land some venture capital backing to pursue its vision as Obvious Ventures came in to lead a $5 million seed round into the company.\n\n\u201cAt Obvious, we believe that natural cannabinoids hold the promise for significant health benefits. We identified beam as a stand-out in a crowded landscape for their product innovation, rigorous focus on quality and ensuring zero THC content in those products and their amazing growth within the fitness community,\u201d said Obvious co-founder James Joaquin, in a statement. \u201cWe also feel that the pro-athlete pasts of both beam\u2019s co-founders have informed a unique entrepreneurial skill, putting beam on a quick trajectory towards profitability.\u201d\n\nObvious definitely has a recent track record of successful investments that point to an awareness of what\u2019s on the horizon for consumers. The firm was an investor in Beyond Meat, whose launch has transformed the market for plant-based meat substitutes.\n\nJoaquin sees another successful recent exit, from the portfolio company Olly, as the closest parallel to the thesis behind beam. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to the work that we did,\u201d he says.\n\nOlly, which had a line of health supplements, was sold to Unilever for an undisclosed amount earlier this year.\n\nWith the money in hand, beam is now thinking about the next phase of product development, which will be the launch of two different products \u2014 a daytime blend and a nighttime blend. The company intends to roll out additional functional products over time, says Lombardi.", "description": "Athletes looking to take a break from all their worries over prescription painkillers and anyone who\u2019s hankering to try out the new cannabinoid-based treatments for their conditions (without worrying about potentially getting dosed with some THC) can now turn to beam.
