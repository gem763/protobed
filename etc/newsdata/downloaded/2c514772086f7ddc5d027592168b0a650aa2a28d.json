Their cumulative wealth has nearly doubled to $41.2 billion, driven by the relentless rise of Nasdaq-listed Atlassian.\n\nAtlassian founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar once again take first and second places on the Young Rich List: they are worth $13.5 billion and $13.2 billion respectively, up from $7 billion each in 2018.\n\nCanva founders Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht have rocketed up the list, from 17th spot with $177 million in 2018, to third spot with $1.35 billion on a new understanding that they, together with technical co-founder Cameron Adams and an equity scheme that extends to all 700 staff, control more than half the business. Ms Perkins and Mr Obrechts' wealth is pooled on the basis they are engaged to be married.\n\nThe pair are worth even more after a funding round last week pushed the valuation of Canva, which provides graphic design tools to 20 million users, to $4.7 billion. In a sign of the times, Canva this week moved to justify its lofty valuation by revealing its annualised revenue will be $291 million by the end of 2019, meaning it is valued at a similar multiple to Atlassian.\n\nIn fourth spot are Collis and Cyan Ta'eed of digital assets marketplace Envato, a bootstrapped business that turned over $134 million in 2017-18.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo others in the Young Rich List top 10 \u2013 Greensill Capital director Peter Greensill and Afterpay founder Nicholas Molnar \u2013 also count technology as crucial parts of their businesses, even though they are classified as part of the financial services industry.\n\nAlgorithms are crucial to how Greensill Capital, worth $5 billion after an investment from SoftBank this year, quickly assesses the credit risk of its small-to-medium enterprise clientele. Meanwhile, Afterpay (worth $8 billion when the Young Rich List was ruled off in September) owes its ubiquity in the \"buy now, pay later\" space to its seamless front-end.\n\nSimilarly seamless is Compass, which offers American real estate agents simple tools to value, market and sell properties. Dr Allon had initially earmarked London and Sydney as the first cities outside the US where Compass would expand, although that bullishness has been tempered by the demise of WeWork.\n\nBorn in Israel, Dr Allon studied computer science at Monash University and the University of NSW. His PhD research at UNSW was acquired for a \"life-changing amount of money\" by Google in 2005. He later sold a business to Twitter. \"I'm a product of Australian colleges and universities,\" he said. \"The most important work I've ever done was in Australia.\"\n\nHis comments about Compass being \"a very different business\" echoes a memo sent to employees at the real estate brokerage this week, effectively distancing itself from WeWork.\n\nUnlike the troubled office space rental company, Compass has no debt and is valued at a revenue multiple comparable to publicly traded real estate technology companies, chief financial officer Kristen Ankerbrandt said in the memo.\n\nFurthermore, Compass\u2019 leadership team \u201cbooks coach tickets and does not fly on private jets\u201d, she said.", "description": "Builders of software-as-a-service platforms or online marketplaces dominate the list of Australia's wealthiest aged 40 and under, but their valuations face pressure.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1332%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4a3ebc938b5d46e1df8947156c3b125c7922a6ae", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
