There\u2019ll be no stocking fillers this year then, I\u2019ll tell the family.\u2019\n\nGeorgia added: \u2018Boots scrapping their 3 for 2 Christmas offer means I\u2019m not doing Christmas presents this year.\u2019\n\nBOOTS ISN'T DOING 3 FOR 2 ON CHRISTMAS GIFTS ANYMORE, CHRISTMAS IS OVER pic.twitter.com/zaedhuYLXa \u2014 Georgina Grogan\u267f (@GeorginaGrogan_) October 27, 2019\n\nEvery year we aim to offer better savings for our customers throughout the festive period.
