These were planned by Sibanye and government. There is no one who assisted us in opposing this, not even government.\n\n\"If government puts profit before the people, what is the future of the country?\" said Mathunjwa.\n\nAsked by Fin24 what options the union was considering to protect the jobs now at risk at the mine and among contractors, Mathunjwa said AMCU would announce its next step next week.\n\n\"We fought this (transaction) and the government supported it, so what must we do? This government is pro-capital and has brought poverty and misery to this country\u2019s people.\n\n\"If government is serious, they should amend Section 189 on ballots to strike. But as it is, this government belongs to capitalists,\" he said.\n\nSibanye senior vice president of investor relations James Wellsted told Fin24 that Sibanye tried to protect jobs by continuing operations such as 4B shaft, K3 mining into Siphumelele ground, Roland mining into MK2 ground as well as K4 concentrator.\n\n'There is no further opposition'\n\n\"We obviously were in touch on the day, because we handed them notice. The union opposed the merger last year through the Competition Commission process. That delayed the transaction.\n\n\"There is no further opposition because the transaction is done and it did not cause these cuts,\" said Wellsted.\n\nHe said the company remained committed to discussions with organised labour on how to mitigate the impact on jobs.\n\nAfter the job cuts were announced on Wednesday, the Department of Mineral Resources released a statement saying it was \"disheartening\" to hear of potential job losses at Sibanye-Stillwater.\n\nIn the statement, the Department urged the company and organised labour \"to act responsibly\" and in the interests of \"the livelihoods of employees and their immediate families\".", "description": "AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa said the union opposed the Sibanye-Lonmin merger with no support from government, adding that the government could not claim to be dismayed by job cuts that it failed to prevent.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5456/3b4993b2bbf949e4ac8bd9cf26211003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
