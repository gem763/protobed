The website itself boasted more than one million downloads of child exploitation videos by users.\n\nEach user was given a unique Bitcoin BTC address when they created an account on the site.\n\nServer analysis revealed the website had over one million Bitcoin addresses, meaning it was able to handle at least one million users.\n\nTo incentivize users to upload video material, the site allegedly issued reward points. Users were also able to earn points by inviting new members. Those who wanted to subscribe to the website could do so by paying around $300 (0.03BTC) a year.\n\nA forfeiture complaint, unsealed today, alleges that law enforcement was able to track Bitcoin payments to the dark web site by following the funds on the blockchain.\n\nThe virtual currency accounts identified in the complaint were allegedly used by 24 individuals in five countries to fund the website and promote the exploitation of children. Prosecutors are seeking to seize Bitcoin held across these accounts.\n\n\u201cDarknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the vilest and reprehensible forms of criminal behavior,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\n\n\u201cChildren around the world are safer because of the actions taken by US and foreign law enforcement to prosecute this case and recover funds for victims,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu, \u201cWe will continue to pursue such criminals on and off the darknet in the United States and abroad, to ensure they receive the punishment their terrible crimes deserve.\u201d", "description": "US prosecutors say the online marketplace was operated by Jong Woo Son, who is currently serving an 18-month jail sentence in his native South Korea.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fbitcoin-cryptocurrency-dark-web.jpg&signature=76ccf54093896e212f9e2fab5620529b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
