And an apparent Sharpie edit caught the attention of the internet.\n\nA closer look at the chart Trump displayed, while discussing the impact and response to Dorian, appears that the original forecast cone that mapped the predicted direction of Dorian on Aug. 29 was altered in black ink to touch a corner of \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Alabama.\n\n\u201cIt was going towards the Gulf, that was what was originally projected,\u201d Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Wednesday, displaying a chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \u201cIt took a right turn, and ultimately \u2014 hopefully we\u2019re going to be lucky, it depends on what happens with South Carolina, North Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe public immediately took notice, with some weather experts even tweeting at the President to remind him that it is illegal to falsify weather reports.\n\nIt is a violation of federal law to falsify a National Weather Service forecast and pass it off as official, as President Trump did here.\n\n\n\n18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2074: https://t.co/jvROnpSJLI pic.twitter.com/TnIuvZRJoS\n\n\n\n\u2014 Dennis Mersereau (@wxdam) September 4, 2019\n\nAt a press conference later in the day to address a plan to curb opioid addiction, Trump defended his comments on Alabama, but added \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d when asked if the weather chart had been altered with a Sharpie.\n\n\u201cI know that Alabama was in the original forecast, they thought they would get it as a piece of it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cActually we have a better map than that which is gonna be presented where we had many lines going directly \u2014 many models, each line being a model, and they were going directly through, and in all cases Alabama was hit, if not lightly, in some places pretty hard.\u201d\n\nThe NOAA has repeatedly stated that Alabama would not be impacted by Dorian.\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nTrump later tweeted a chart to double-down on his claims about Alabama. The chart, published by the South Florida Water Management District, includes a clause at the bottom stating \u201cNHC Advisories and County Emergency Management Statements supersede this product. This graphic should complement, not replace, NHC discussions. If anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product.\u201d\n\nTrump added \u201cI accept the Fake News apologies!\u201d\n\nThis was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies! pic.twitter.com/0uCT0Qvyo6 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019\n\n\u201cSharpie\u201d immediately began trending on Twitter.\n\nWho among us hasn\u2019t altered a National Hurricane Center forecast with a sharpie? \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) September 4, 2019\n\nI was asked to go back on MSNBC today to talk about the utter chaos in the UK, but then after I returned to 30 Rock they bumped me because of breaking news about how POTUS uses a Sharpie \u2014 Felix Salmon (@felixsalmon) September 4, 2019", "description": "The Aug. 29 weather chart that mapped the predicted direction of Hurricane Dorian was marked in black ink to touch a corner of Alabama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BLuL_23V6WbDiXC3qwuagA--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/33d544ccfef63ef466c02760396dfb5d", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
