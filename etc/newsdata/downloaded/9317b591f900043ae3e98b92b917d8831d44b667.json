At long last, the country has the president who will pull no punches\u2014and brook no opposition\u2014in restoring the republic\u2019s natural-law and natural-rights foundations. While Lincoln\u2014who himself seized broad executive power and skirted positive laws in a time of moral emergency\u2014did so by ending slavery, Lincoln\u2019s current legatees, the Jaffaite Straussians in the academy, and the Christian-rightists in the populace and in the Trump administration, will fulfill their latter-day Lincolnian mission by fighting by whatever means necessary abortion rights, gay rights, and the abandonment of \u201cnatural\u201d gender roles, in battles they see as essential for protecting \u201cthe laws of nature and nature\u2019s God.\u201d In the way these movement voices have framed the stakes, the right and the Republicans stand in the shoes of the 19th-century abolitionists and Lincoln. By contrast, in these arguments and stories, progressives and liberals are cast as the legatees of Douglas who, heedless of divinely ordained right and wrong, accede to the claims of merely human will in blatant defiance of natural law.\n\nThe fact that Trump\u2019s most fervent intellectual support within the conservative movement is issuing from the West Coast\u2019s Claremont Institute and the Christian right, often from scholars, clerics, and pundits who\u2014far from ignoring America\u2019s history of slavery, as oblivious liberals often charge\u2014talk and write, it sometimes seems, about nothing else, is not happenstance. And it is more than crass transactionalism. While they certainly grumble about Trump\u2019s personal morals, they have arrived at an unshakable conviction about his divinely ordained role as a vindicating statesman and great president who is willing to do whatever it takes to restore the country to its moral and constitutional foundations.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ken Kersch", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Some-Conservative-Traditions-Embrace-Donald-Trump", "Utm_Medium Social Utm_Content Edit-Promo"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
