He\u2019s flamboyant, snarky and judgmental, even running a tabloid-like morning gossip broadcast at school.\n\nBut in its most recent two seasons the show has smartly expanded Matthew\u2019s story line, depicting the life of a precocious queer adolescent who has a propensity for the dramatic and is almost entirely out of the closet. (The lone exception being what Matthew defines as the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d d\u00e9tente between him and his father.)\n\nIn Season Three, which premiered this month, Matthew (voiced by Andrew Rannells) even pursues his first same-sex romantic relationship, with Aiden (Zachary Quinto), who is the same age. Matthew frets about Aiden with Maury the Hormone Monster \u2014 a character who embodies each child\u2019s confused pubescent impulses \u2014 but the pair eventually become, well, a pair. Their relationship is quite sweet: Awkward courtship takes place over FaceTime; the two kiss for the first time after Matthew coyly yet confidently slides his hand into Aiden\u2019s while an unimportant movie playing on a nearby laptop fades into the background.\n\nI\u2019m a gay man in my early 20s, so Matthew\u2019s story line caught my attention, namely because his experience differs so substantially from my own lived analog. My queer friends and I all came out in our late teens or as adults and openly pursued our first same-sex relationships only in adulthood. This, queer people will tell you, is fairly standard. For L.G.B.T.Q. adults, Matthew\u2019s subplot offers a glimpse into the childhood we didn\u2019t have. But for those queers who will follow us, Matthew evinces hope.", "description": "Most L.G.B.T.Q. adults could not openly explore their sexuality as children, but the Netflix series provides a template (and hope) for future generations.", "authors": ["Charles Dunst"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/opinion/18Dunst1/18Dunst1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
