To the journalist reporting the story it was never challenged nor followed up on. Yet it\u2019s reality and mere existence is worth noting.\n\nThe speaker of the House had knowledge of the transcript of President Trump\u2019s phone call before he released it.\n\nShe admitted it on \"60 Minutes.\" She then also attempted to cover her tracks hoping no one noticed.\n\nScott Pelley of CBS news felt the inclusion of the question as it related to the issue of Trump calling Pelosi prior to the transcript\u2019s release was newsworthy.\n\nHe included the tidbit in the story tease, early in the first couple of minutes he narrates Trump\u2019s phoning of the speaker, then plays his asking her the question complete with her answer.\n\nPelosi responds by touting that the president had assured her that the phone call between himself and the new President of Ukraine \u201cwas perfect.\u201d This in itself sounded very consistent with soundbites heard across the media shortly after Pelosi announced her \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d (I use the quote marks because until she actually takes the vote to begin an inquiry or to file articles of Impeachment against the president \u2014 Congress is not officially impeaching anyone.)\n\nWhat came next was what caught my ear.\n\nAfter categorizing the president\u2019s response of the \u201cperfect call,\u201d she then implies that she \u201cknew better\u201d than to believe the president\u2014because\u2014she knew the content of the call. She then hastily tried to cover up that admission by clumsily adding that what she knew in that moment about the transcript was in the public record.\n\n(Watch here around 3:40 into the report: https://www.cbs.com/shows/60_ minutes/video/ E4B5poSZW8rDKx3gRlWsh0HeooqtoK 2p/the-impeachment-inquiry- crown-prince-mohammad-bin- salman-great-white/ )\n\nThe phone call she received from President Trump was a courtesy. Trying to do Pelosi a solid\u2014so as not to embarrass herself (and the entire nation)\u2014the president believed a simple bit of clarity might help her avoid the prospects of self-humiliation.\n\nHer hubris in holding her own non-announcement and press conference now made sense.\n\nIn the \"60 Minutes\" piece she even gloats over the \u201cfact\u201d that she had \u201calways claimed\u201d that she\u2019d allow the \u201cfacts\u201d to \u201clead the way.\u201d Smugly stating that now she \u201chad them.\u201d\n\nBelieving she had more knowledge of the president\u2019s phone call than the transcript revealed she held the presser and announced \u201cher inquiry.\u201d\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy and others have observed that if Speaker Pelosi had merely waited 48 hours before pronouncing something \u201copened\u201d (that technically still is not) she might not look quite so foolish.\n\nAnyone that can read the transcript of the president\u2019s phone call (the original source for all of the \u201curgent concern\u201d \u2014 even though the non-Whistleblower and the Intelligence community\u2019s Inspector General had never heard the call nor read the transcript when declaring said \u201curgent concern\u201d) can see in plain English that the two presidents congratulate one another. The Ukraine\u2019s president then asks for weapons, and the American President asks for the Ukraine\u2019s help in solving the 2016 election meddling.\n\nThe Bidens show up 504 words later unrelated to the missile request altogether.\n\nThe New York Post\u2019s Michael Goodwin appeared on my show on Monday. Upon hearing the Pelosi admission replayed Goodwin remarked as to the growing certainty in his own thinking that the sequence of the \u201cimpeachment\u201d events didn\u2019t appear to add up unless there was coordination between the whistleblower and top committee Congressional Democrats.\n\nLate last week the Federalist\u2019s co-founder Sean M. Davis remarked in a tweet his observation that the Steele dossier and the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint seemed to have been authored by the same voice, tone, and style.\n\nOn Monday, Davis also pointed out that the intel community\u2019s standard of evidence for whistleblower complaints were not met under rules long established. He noted that only under the rules which had been largely unknowingly and only recently changed concerning a whistleblower\u2019s first-hand knowledge (that they not be required to have any) would one have been able to file this complaint \u201ccredibly.\u201d\n\nIn my discussion with Goodwin on Monday I even noted that the circular sourcing of news articles referencing the story but not original sources were again used in the whistleblower complaint to beef up the \u201curgency\u201d in how the complaint read.\n\nThe exact same evidentiary process was used in the phony FISA warrants.\n\nGoodwin observed that the repeated use of these tactics appear to indicate that Pelosi may have been in on the game long before the transcript was officially released.\n\nIf true it also means that the deep state hacks buried amongst the lifers embedded in the national security apparatus, the White House, and the State Department are still very much alive and their efforts to take down the lawfully elected president is still active.\n\nIn 400 days the American voter will decide who is genuinely waking up each morning seeking to make America better. A man who\u2014despite all odds against him\u2014has kept more than 87 promises to the American people, or an establishment class so blinded by their hate for his success that they will stop at literally nothing to prevent the American people from doing exactly that.\n\nWhat say you, voter?", "description": "To many it probably just seemed a typical misspeak.
