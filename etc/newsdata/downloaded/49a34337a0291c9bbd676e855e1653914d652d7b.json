Buying activity rose another 0.6 per cent in September to 512,000 units (seasonally-adjusted and annualized) \u2014 the highest level in 21 months and 6.6 per cent above the 10-year average.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada senior economist Robert Hogue notes that conditions are ripe for another rally in housing prices after a pause earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cDemand-supply conditions have tightened up, and are gradually heating up prices. Low interest rates, strong labour markets and rapid population growth will continue to fuel demand in the period ahead,\u201d said Hogue in a report. \u201cPromises made during the federal election campaign could heat things up further.\u201d\n\nThe influx of immigrants will also see demand for residential units soar. A new report by Royal Le Page out this morning says newcomers \u2014 those who arrived in the country within the past 10 years \u2014 already represent one in every five home buyers in the country.\n\n\u201cIf the current international migration level is maintained, Canadian newcomers are expected to purchase 680,000 homes over the next five years,\u201d Le Page said in a report. In 2018, international migration accounted for 80.5 per cent of Canada\u2019s population growth according to Statistics Canada.\n\nOnly 32 per cent of newcomers own a home, compared to the national average of 68 per cent. \u201cOf those who purchase a home, 51 per cent of newcomers buy a detached house, 18 per cent buy a condominium, 15 per cent buy a townhouse and 13 per cent buy a semi-detached house,\u201d according to Le Page.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s you need to know this morning:\n\nStatistics Canada likely to report annual inflation rate rose to 2.1 per cent in September\n\nRetail sales data out today\n\nATB Financial presents 2020 Economic Outlook with keynote speakers, Todd Hirsch, Chief Economist, ATB Financial, and Pierre Cleroux, Vice President, Research and Chief Economist, BDC in Calgary\n\nMax Bell Foundation presents The Future of Energy in Canada with Martha Hall Findlay, CEO of Canada West Foundation in Calgary\n\nBruce Ralston, B.C. minister of jobs, trade and technology, joins Indigenous economic development leaders for an announcement regarding support for Indigenous businesses in Kamloop, B.C.\n\nBMO & TMX Hemp & Medical Cannabis Conference, in London, U.K.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will release an updated Beige Book at 2:00 pm ET\n\nNotable earnings: Kinder Morgan Canada, The A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund, Netflix, Bank of America, IBM\n\nJustin Trudeau may no longer be the flavour of the month, but he has presided over a strong job market. And that could still tilt the election the Liberals\u2019 way.\n\nRidings where the NDP fared well in 2015 also seem to enjoy strong labour markets, but Conservative-favouring ridings have seen slower job growth, according to a new report.\n\n\u201cWe find that recent labour market strength has been concentrated in certain areas of the 2015 electoral map. In particular, regions where the NDP or Bloc Quebecois were competitive, typically splitting with the Liberals, have seen substantial improvement, mostly in Quebec or B.C,\u201d Indeed Hiring Lab said in a study out last week. \u201cMeanwhile, there\u2019s been more modest progress in areas the Liberals either swept or split with the Conservatives, primarily in Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Finally, the post oil-crash labour market malaise in Alberta and Saskatchewan has had solid Conservative regions lagging.\u201d\n\nThe report noted that in August, the average unemployment rate over the previous 12 months in Liberal-NDP/Bloc regions was 2.1 percentage points lower than in December 2015, while other NDP-competitive areas also saw a substantial decline.\n\n\u201cRegions the Liberals swept or split with the Conservatives also made progress, but with declines closer to 1 percentage point. Unemployment was up slightly in Conservative areas,\u201d the report noted.\n\nIt must also be pointed out, though, that Conservative-favouring Alberta and Saskatchewan are also going through a lean period mostly due to lower commodity prices, which would have skewed the results.\n\n\u2014 Please send your news, comments and stories to yhussain@postmedia.com. \u2014 Yadullah Hussain @YAD_FPEnergy\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg", "description": "Stuff you need to know", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/1005_biz_wire_housing_market.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
