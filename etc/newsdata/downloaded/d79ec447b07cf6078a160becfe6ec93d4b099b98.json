In addition to marrying Ashton Kutcher \u2014 who she claims cheated on her \u2014 the actress has revealed that she slept with Jon Cryer in the course of filming the 1984 movie No Small Affair.\n\n\u201cJon fell for me in real life, too, and lost his virginity to me while we were making that movie,\u201d the 56-year-old writes in her new book, per Page Six.\n\nBut it was a small affair to Moore, who cites a \u201cself-destructive\u201d streak at the time of the tryst with a besotted Cryer.\n\n\u201cIt pains me to think of how callous I was with his feelings \u2014 that I stole what could have been such an important and beautiful moment from him,\u201d she says.\n\nView photos Cryer (pictured with Two and Half Men co-star and Moore's ex-husband Ashton Kutcher) denies Moore's claim.
