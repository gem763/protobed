Luckily, I was one of the lucky ones and I did come through the other side and I am here to tell my own story. It's important to get the therapy, be nice to yourself. I still wake up, I woke up this morning with a lot of anxiety, just the shock of, \"No, I am not with that person anymore. I am fine.\"\n\n'I am building myself and healing myself. I have a lot of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy for my PTSD and anxiety. It's just a working journey that I am going to be always working on.'", "description": "Mel B has revealed she is haunted by a terrifying nightmare in which her ex-husband Stephen Belafonte cuts her finger off.", "authors": ["Connie Rusk For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/11/19953170-0-image-a-7_1571568365167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
