REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File Photo\n\nFrance saw national output rise 0.3% in the third quarter - defying forecasts for slightly slower growth - as unemployment in Germany rose faster than expected and its chambers of commerce warned that exports would shrink next year for the first time since the financial crisis as world trade friction mounts.\n\nThe contrast in national fortunes was underlined as incoming European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde doubled down on her predecessor Mario Draghi\u2019s calls on Germany to use some of its budget surplus to invest in growth-enhancing measures.\n\n\u201cThose that have the room for maneuver, those that have a budget surplus, that\u2019s to say Germany, the Netherlands, why not use that budget surplus and invest in infrastructure? ... Why not invest in education, why not invest in innovation, to allow for a better re-balancing?\u201d she told France\u2019s RTL broadcaster.\n\nFrance\u2019s economy, which has long relied more on domestic consumption than that of its northern neighbor, got a boost from President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s injection of 10 billion euros in stimulus to quell the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests this year.\n\nMost of that money went on boosting benefits for minimum-wage earning workers. Paris has also said it would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros in total next year.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, measures enacted in recent years .. have contributed to make the French labor market more flexible and have lowered labor costs for corporates,\u201d JP Morgan\u2019s Raphael Brun-Aguerre said of reforms begun under Macron\u2019s predecessor Francois Hollande and pursued by him.\n\n\u201cHUGE CHALLENGE\u201d\n\nA separate read-out by the European Commission in Brussels showed that economic sentiment across the 19-country euro zone as a whole deteriorated in October for a second straight month as pessimism in industry spread to services and consumers.\n\nA breakdown showed that sentiment fell in Germany for the second straight month and to its lowest level in more than six years. France also saw a small dip but remained above the euro zone average.\n\nThe Germany economy shrank 0.1% in the second quarter, and third-quarter output figures next month are expected to show another fall, putting the country in recession by the standard definition.\n\nExport-reliant Germany is also more exposed than most to the disputes triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies and a cooling of Chinese growth.\n\n\u201cFor our economy, with its strong industrial core, this is a huge challenge,\u201d DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce President Eric Schweitzer said when presenting the association\u2019s latest business sentiment survey of more than 28,000 managers.\n\nDIHK said it expects Germany\u2019s annual export growth to wither to 0.3% this year from 2.1% in 2018, adding that exports are likely to shrink by 0.5% next year. Germany has in recent years averaged export growth of around 5.5%, Schweitzer said.\n\nData from the Federal Labour Office showed the number of people out of work increased by 6,000 to 2.287 million in seasonally adjusted terms. That compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a rise of 2,000.\n\nThe jobless rate held steady at 5.0%. That was slightly above the record German low of 4.9% reached earlier this year and much lower than the 8.5% recorded in France in the second quarter, itself the lowest level reached since the end of 2008.\n\nDraghi\u2019s acknowledgement after re-launching ECB asset purchases in September that monetary policy could not go much further to help the euro zone, has added to pressure on Germany in particular to adopt a more expansionary policy.\n\nThe coalition government in Berlin has consistently rejected those calls and says it is already using the room for maneuver created by lower borrowing costs to spend where necessary.", "description": "Strong domestic stimulus is helping France shrug off a global slowdown even as export-dependent Germany heads closer to a recession, starkly divergent data on the euro zone's two leading economies showed on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Michel Rose", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446507481&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0UA", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
