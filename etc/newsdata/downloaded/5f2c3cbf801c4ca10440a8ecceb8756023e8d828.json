I've never seen a ref take five strides,\u201d Kane said, according to ESPN. \u201cIf you look at his face, he's getting all this power and he's trying to drive me into the ice, which is what he did. That's unbelievable. Talk about abuse of an official? How about abuse of a player? It's an absolute joke.\u201d\n\nThe strong words came after Kane got involved with Golden Knights defenseman Deryk Engelland. The veteran appeared to cross-check Kane, who responded with a slash. However, Kane\u2019s slash appeared to have made contact with linesman Kiel Murchison. The official then grabbed Kane\u2019s jersey, appearing to try and prevent any potential escalating incidents with Engelland.\n\nTORONTO MAPLE LEAFS GM LEARNED ABOUT AUSTON MATTHEWS' ALLEGED DISORDERLY CONDUCT THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nBoth players were given game misconducts. Kane was shouting at the referees from the bench.\n\n\u201cI was just skating up the ice,\u201d Kane said. \u201cMinding my own business, and next thing you know, I get driven into the ice by one of the officials. I wasn't even engaged with one of their players. Explain that to me, how I get kicked out of the game for that. Baffling.\u201d\n\nKane said officials react a different way to him than others.\n\n\u201cIt's funny ... if you look at the way I get treated out there when it comes to the scrums, or when the other team is trying to do [something] to me, there's a massive difference compared to everybody else on the ice,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nKane played 75 games for the Sharks' last season and tied for the league in game misconducts with three.
