Callan was born with the rare genetic condition ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which causes ammonia to accumulate in the body\n\nCallan Price had to have a liver transplant from a donation made by his dad, Matt\n\nAlthough he pulled through, Callan spent the next five months on dialysis, before doctors warned his only hope was a new liver.\n\nRather than go on the waiting list, Mr Price, 39, offered to donate the 20 per cent of his liver that Callan needed. The pair went under the knife for 10 hours on February 1.\n\nMore than eight months on, the now 17-month-old is 'exactly like any other young boy', with just a scar across his abdomen to show what he has been through.\n\nCallan (pictured with his father) spent months on dialysis in hospital. Doctors warned his only hope was a liver transplant. To save him going on the waiting list, Mr Price offered to help\n\nCallan's condition, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD), affects between one and nine in every 100,000 people, statistics show. It causes ammonia to accumulate in the body.\n\nCallan started making grunting noises and was struggling to breathe as soon as he was born.\n\nMr Price, also father to Ronnie, five, and Tom, two, said: 'We thought there was nothing to worry about.\n\n'The hospital actually took him off us when he was 40 minutes old but they brought him back to us and said he was fine.\n\n'They said his breathing difficulties would calm down in a few hours but it didn't and he kept deteriorating.'\n\nAfter being rushed to intensive care, Callan later went into a coma.\n\nMr Price, who shares his children with his wife Jen, 36, said: 'We went into the hospital thinking we were going to come home with a newborn baby but he was in a coma four days later.\n\n'We were told he probably wouldn't make it through the night, we were told to expect the worse and hope for the best.'\n\nCallan was transferred to a specialist unit at St Thomas Hospital in London, where he was diagnosed with OTCD.\n\nThe newborn was hooked up to a blood dialysis machine to try and clear the ammonia out of his system.\n\nMr Price, a project director at an events company, said: 'We had to try and get our heads around everything while Callan was in a coma.\n\n'Callan was poisoning his own brain. His brain was closing down as his ammonia level was so high.\n\n'He was struggling to manage his protein intake, he was breaking his own body down.'\n\nCallan spent much of his early life in hospital (seen left) and even entered a coma at just four days old. Since the transplant, the now 17-month-old (right) is like 'any other young boy'\n\nMr Price (pictured left with his son) believes Callan's future is 'bright'. The youngster (pictured right in hospital) became severely unwell when the ammonia caused his brain to 'close down'\n\nThe youngster came out of the coma after five days, but still needed dialysis.\n\nAt five months old, his parents were told his only hope was to have a new liver and he was placed on the organ transplant waiting list.\n\nRather than wait for one to become available, Mr Price offered to donate part of his liver but was told he first had to lose weight and cut down his cholesterol.\n\nBy November, he had lost almost 28lbs (12.7kg) and cut out alcohol completely. However, Callan was still too small for the operation.\n\nThe family were told the procedure would be able to go ahead the following year. It was brought forward to February 1 when Callan continued to deteriorate.\n\nThe father-son pair both went under the knife at King's College Hospital in London, with 20 per cent of Mr Price's liver being put into Callan.\n\n'It was just unbelievable how they could put part of my liver into a little baby,' Mr Price said.\n\n'When I came out, I was just so happy to see him again. It had been such a stressful time but just seeing his face made everything better.'\n\nThere is a chance Callan could reject the organ and may require a new liver in the future. But, for now, the youngster is doing well.\n\n'He's exactly like any other young boy,' Mr Price said. 'He plays with his big brothers and is so funny in himself.\n\n'You wouldn't be able to tell there is anything wrong with him except for a big scar on his stomach.'\n\nCallan will require medication for the rest of his life and regularly goes to hospital for check ups.\n\n'The future is quite bright, we have a normal as possible life,' Mr Price said. 'He's expected to grow into a fully-grown adult. He's been so brave and I'm so proud of him.'\n\nThe family are speaking out to raise awareness of the importance of organ donation.\n\nDespite all he endured, Callan managed to smile through his hospital treatment (seen left). Now home, the toddler (right) will require medication all his life and regular check-ups\n\nCallan (left) may still reject his father's organ and could require a new transplant in the future, but is doing well for now.
