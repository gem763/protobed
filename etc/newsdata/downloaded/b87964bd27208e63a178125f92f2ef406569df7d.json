We investigate the killing of 42 school boys in an #airstrike in #Yemen by the #Saudi led coalition. UK still a major arms supplier to the Saudis. These children should be alive today. Thanks to incredible colleagues @NicolaCareem @LeeDuranthttps://t.co/jm6l0otngP \u2014 Orla Guerin (@OrlaGuerin) October 19, 2018\n\nThe massacre was just a little over two months ago. At the time, it was one of the few stories of Saudi coalition atrocities that had captured the attention of the wider world, but that quickly faded. The coalition conducted one of their sham \u201cinvestigations\u201d and outrageously never apologized for killing the children on the bus. Instead, the coalition maintained that the bus had been a \u201clegitimate\u201d target all along, but they said it should not have been targeted in the market. They went so far as to say that there were no children on the bus. Contrary to Saudi coalition lies, the boys were out on a field trip and had nothing to do with the war. Their bus is one of the dozens of civilian vehicles that the coalition has attacked this year alone. There is no possible justification for targeting a bus filled with children at any time.\n\nThe school bus massacre is just one of thousands of war crimes that the Saudi coalition has committed against Yemeni civilians, but it stands out as one of the cruelest and most senseless of all of them. These were the boys murdered for no reason:\n\nHeartbreaking picture by my colleague \u2066@NicolaCareem\u2069 of young victims of airstrike in #Yemen. No apologies for reposting.

Our government continues to arm and refuel the planes that regularly carry out attacks on civilian targets in Yemen, and that support makes attacks like this one possible. If the U.S. pulled the plug on military assistance to the coalition, it would be practically impossible for them to continue their bombing campaign, and that could give Yemen a chance at the peace that has been denied to Yemenis for years. Congress must halt all U.S. support for the war on Yemen as quickly as possible before there are any more Dahyans.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_103067756.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-19"}
