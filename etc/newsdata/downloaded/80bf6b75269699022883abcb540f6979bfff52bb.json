Germany's led losses with a 1.5% drop, while the Italian was down 1.2% and the U.K. was down 0.7%.\n\nAccording to IHS Markit\u2019s purchasing manager surveys, the German economy contracted for the first time since 2012 in September, defying hopes of a turnaround while the French economy also slowed further.\n\n\u201cThe economy is limping towards the final quarter of the year and, on its current trajectory, might not see any growth before the end of 2019,\u201d said IHS\u2019s principal economist Phil Smith.\n\nGermany\u2019s manufacturing sector, for so long the engine room of the region\u2019s economy, contracted at its sharpest rate since the depths of the Great Recession in 2009. The service sector, which had initially held up well as manufacturing had cooled, also registered its first decline in new business since 2014, IHS said.\n\n\u201cThe European Central Bank might see its course as vindicated and further loosenings (of monetary policy) \u2013 especially after Christine Lagarde takes over \u2013 are to be expected,\u201d said analysts at Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in a research note.\n\nHowever, it seems clear that any further measures will be resisted by a good part of the council. Dutch central bank governor Klaas Knot, who dissented from last week\u2019s decision to restart quantitative easing, told De Telegraaf newspaper that he still felt the ECB\u2019s actions were \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and refused to rule out the risk of Dutch pension payouts being cut as a result of \u201cquasi-permanent\u201d low interest rates.\n\nThe negative tone was reinforced by a fresh surge in oil prices as Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels reportedly warned that Iran is planning another strike on Saudi Arabia before long. Higher oil prices are traditionally bad for the economy of Europe, which is a big net importer of oil and gas. Energy stocks still managed to fall, even so, after hopes for at least an interim trade deal between China and the U.S. faded at the weekend.\n\nThe stand-out gainers were airline stocks, which surged as U.K. travel group Thomas Cook went into liquidation. EasyJet rose 4.5% and Ryanair rose 1.8%, while rival travel groups Tui rose 5.9% and On the Beach rose 5.1%.", "description": "StockBeat:  PMIs, Thomas Cook, Oil Cast a Pall Over European Stocks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1A06E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
