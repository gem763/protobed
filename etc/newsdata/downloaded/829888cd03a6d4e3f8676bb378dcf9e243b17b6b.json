Our plan breaks down the barriers around mental health and builds up a sense of belonging that will help millions of suffering Americans heal.\u201d\n\nButtigieg says his plan will ensure at least 75 percent of people who need treatment receive care. About 11 percent of the 21.7 million people who needed substance use treatment over the course of a year receive it, according to federal figures from 2015.\n\nWhat would the plan do?\n\n\n\nBeyond adding resources, the plan attempts to address the public health effects of isolation and loneliness.\n\nThe plan would beef up the behavioral health workforce by increasing reimbursement rates and making health workers' loan repayment programs more generous, specifically for those in rural, underserved areas. It also aims to increase access to opioid addiction treatment and inpatient care at psychiatric facilities.\n\nButtigieg would invest more in veteran suicide programs and create a three-digit suicide hotline. His plan also calls for more mental health workers in schools and increased investments in early intervention programs.\n\n\n\nHow would it work?\n\n\n\nThe plan would provide $100 billion in grants over 10 years to communities for prevention and care integration. It proposes expanding access to inpatient treatment by repealing a decades-old Medicaid law that prohibits reimbursements for patients in residential treatment facilities with more than 16 beds. The Obama and Trump administrations have taken steps to allow states to work around the restriction. Buttigieg\u2019s plan would completely repeal it.\n\nThe plan would deregulate buprenorphine, one of three FDA-approved medication-assisted treatments for opioid addiction, to increase access to that drug. Prescribers, under federal law, can only prescribe the medication to a limited number of patients. Buttigieg\u2019s plan requires all private insurers and Medicare and Medicaid to cover all three forms of medication-assisted treatment. It also prioritizes research to develop treatments for other drug addictions, like methamphetamine. It would also create national standards for addiction care.\n\n\n\nWhat are the weaknesses in the proposal?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Buttigieg plans to pay for the plan, which not only provides $100 billion in grants, but includes many proposals like increasing provider reimbursement rates and repealing a Medicaid law, that would come with a hefty price tag. Fiscal conservatives have balked at similar proposals.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear how Buttigieg plans to further enforce federal parity laws and require private insurance plans to cover all three forms of medication-assisted treatment.\n\n\n\nWhat have other Democrats proposed?\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar have both proposed $100 billion plans to combat addiction and address mental health issues.\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version misstated the total cost of the plan. Buttigieg's campaign later described it as about $300 billion, citing internal estimates.", "description": "Beyond adding resources, the plan attempts to address the public health effects of isolation and loneliness.", "authors": ["Brianna Ehley"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/12/f5/c5835c0a497980ff9f7a1e69a6c2/19822-pete-buttigieg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
