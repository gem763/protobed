But there was never an attack on the civilian population,\u201d said Alicia Guzman, 52, who runs a candy store near a traffic crossing blocked by the gunmen. She and her family scrambled to their nearby home when the cartel members roared up, and cowered inside for hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe offensive in Culiacan has sparked intense criticism of the crime-fighting strategy of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. And it has exposed one of the country\u2019s foremost problems: the government\u2019s slipping control over parts of the territory.\n\nThere are an increasing number of areas \u201cwhere you effectively have a state presence, but under negotiated terms with whoever runs the show locally,\u201d said Falko Ernst, the senior Mexico analyst for the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe Culiacan assault, captured on cellphone videos that zipped around social media, \u201cvisualizes it very forcefully,\u201d he said.\n\nThursday afternoon\u2019s attack came on the heels of several incidents highlighting the ability of organized-crime groups to challenge the government. On Monday, gunmen ambushed a convoy of state police in the western state of Michoacan, killing 14. Last month, the Northeast Cartel ordered gas stations in the border city of Nuevo Laredo to deny service to police or military vehicles, leaving them desperate for fuel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut never had Mexicans seen a city of nearly 1 million people openly seized by a cartel \u2014 forcing the cancellation of school classes, the closure of the airport and the postponement of a professional soccer game.\n\n\u201cIt was a political defeat, a security defeat, and a defeat of perception \u2014 of the way Mexicans view their own government,\u201d said Gustavo Mohar, a former top security official who is now a consultant.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador took office last December vowing to depart from previous governments\u2019 reliance on the military to fight organized-crime groups, a strategy blamed for tens of thousands of deaths. He promised to invest in social programs addressing the root causes of violence, such as poverty and unemployment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHugs not bullets,\u201d was his phrase.\n\nBut the leftist quickly pivoted and created a national guard, a sort of militarized police. His government has also continued to work closely with U.S. authorities on anti-narcotics operations, and attempted to detain organized-crime leaders.\n\nAD\n\nRicardo M\u00e1rquez, another former senior Mexican security official, said the government\u2019s actions had generated incentives for the violence to continue.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they first say they\u2019re not going to go against organized crime, and then go after it and fail, is a double incentive for these groups,\u201d he said.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador defended the decision to release the suspect, saying it was taken \u201cto protect citizens. You cannot fight fire with fire.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn Culiacan, many residents appeared supportive of his decision.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what kind of massacre would have happened\u201d if the suspected drug trafficker wasn\u2019t released, said Guzman, the shop owner. (She is not related to Ovidio Guzman.)\n\nCuliacan is a vivid example of a city where the government\u2019s control has eroded over time. It is the storied heart of Mexico\u2019s drug-trafficking industry, the capital of a state where marijuana and poppy grow in abundance and characters such as El Chapo have long been folk heroes. The former head of the Sinaloa Cartel is serving a life sentence in the United States after being convicted in February of drug trafficking and other charges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut his organization remains among the most powerful in Mexico, with his sons playing key roles in its management, officials say.\n\nCuliacan doesn\u2019t look, on the face of it, like a city controlled by organized crime. The gunmen who carried out Thursday\u2019s attack have vanished. Traffic is flowing along the endless avenues packed with small shops and restaurants.\n\nBut locals see the signs of the narcos\u2019 presence everywhere: the gas stations run by one notorious trafficker, the empty office buildings suspected of being money-laundering vehicles, the baseball caps emblazoned with 701 \u2014 El Chapo\u2019s number on the Forbes list of billionaires a decade ago.\n\nAD\n\nThe poorest residents live in shacks on dirt roads. The wealthiest live in La Primavera, a city-within-a-city featuring an artificial lake and golf courses, closed off to most Culiacan residents by private guards. It\u2019s hardly surprising that residents are lured by the seemingly easy money of drug trafficking.\n\nAD\n\nAlong with that wealth, though, comes violence. Shootouts involving cartel members are not uncommon.\n\n\u201cThere have been manifestations of their muscle, the force they have, but it never got to these levels,\u201d said Oscar Loza, a human rights activist. \u201cThe blockades were military style. They took the city by assault.\u201d\n\nIf some city residents approved of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s decision to free Ovidio Guzman, others were indignant.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDelinquents shouldn\u2019t have power. How is it possible they do whatever they want?\u201d asked Lourdes Mart\u00ednez, 49, who works in a pharmacy near the crossing blocked by the gunmen.\n\nStill, she acknowledged that the cartel members were part of the social fabric, sometimes more effective at resolving problems than authorities. For example, if your car is stolen, it is more likely you would get it back by contacting cartel members through an acquaintance than by waiting for the police to crack the case, she said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe cartel controls the city,\u201d she added.\n\nSome security experts said, however, that Thursday\u2019s violence shouldn\u2019t be taken as a sign that the government was overpowered by organized-crime groups. Senior officials have acknowledged serious flaws in the operation, saying it was carried out by lower-level personnel without informing their superiors.\n\nAD\n\nAlejandro Hope, a security analyst, said the government failed to sufficiently plan or have enough personnel on hand for the operation.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not been overtaken in terms of its capacity to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe point is that the state hasn\u2019t organized itself to effectively confront criminal groups. This was an improvised operation, planned poorly and executed terribly.\u201d\n\nGabriela Mart\u00ednez and Kevin Sieff in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cThe cartel controls the city,\u201d one resident said.", "authors": ["Mary Beth Sheridan", "Correspondent Covering Mexico", "Central America"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KcnuJiP7qlw9pojYuPQlI5wVJPk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTIGJYXSYUI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
