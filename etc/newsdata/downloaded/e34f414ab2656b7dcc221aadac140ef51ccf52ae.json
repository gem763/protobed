It cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered random samples.\n\nOf all the parties, the Conservatives were the most likely to lock in their support early.\n\nFully 50 per cent of respondents who voted for the Tories said they made their choice before the campaign started. By contrast, just 30 per cent of Liberals, 22 per cent of New Democrats, 31 per cent of Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois supporters, 35 per cent of Greens and 31 per cent of supporters of the People's Party of Canada said the same.\n\nOverall, 57 per cent said their vote was based on their political convictions, without any thought given to their candidates' chances of winning.\n\nThe 35 per cent who did take strategic voting into account included 39 per cent of Conservative supporters, 43 per cent of Liberals, 28 per cent of New Democrats, 18 per cent of Bloc supporters, 16 per cent of Greens and 24 per cent of People's Party supporters.\n\nSome Liberal voters considered voting NDP\n\nBut while strategic voting was a factor, the poll suggests it wasn't the primary factor for most. Asked to identify the main reason why they chose to vote for a party, 37 per cent said they did so because the platform and values aligned with their own. Nine per cent said their primary motivation was to get rid of Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, six per cent said it was to vote against another party and four per cent said they voted mainly for the best local candidate.\n\nTrudeau spent the final week of the campaign warning progressive voters that they must vote Liberal to prevent Andrew Scheer's Conservatives from forming government.\n\nThe poll suggests Trudeau had good reason to be worried that progressive voters might split their votes among the Liberals, NDP, Greens and Bloc, allowing the Conservatives to come up the middle.\n\nOf the respondents who ultimately voted Liberal, 46 per cent said they had considered voting for the NDP at some point during the campaign.\n\nAbout 30 per cent of Liberal voters also considered voting Bloc and 29 per cent thought about going Green. Some of those who ended up voting Liberal considered more than one other party during the campaign.\n\nBy contrast, those who voted Conservative were much less likely to have considered other options. Just 18 per cent of those voters considered the NDP, 15 per cent considered the People's Party, 13 per cent considered the Liberals, 13 per cent the Greens and 11 per cent the Bloc.\n\nIn the end, Trudeau's Liberals won 157 seats, 13 short of a majority. The Conservatives, who spent the final week of the campaign warning against a Liberal-NDP coalition, wound up with 121.\n\nThe outcome, combined with the latest poll results, suggest \"the messaging of the Liberals in the last legs of the campaign, sort of post-debate, played much better than the messaging from the Conservatives,\" said Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.\n\nIndeed, while the Liberals stemmed the bleeding of their support to the NDP and Greens, Bourque said the Conservatives seemed unable to grow their support from the outset of the campaign.\n\n\"The Conservatives simply just delivered their base on election day and not anything else.\"\n\nAmong those who didn't vote, 15 per cent said they were working, travelling or otherwise unavailable to cast ballots, 14 per cent said they weren't eligible to vote, 13 per cent said they don't trust politicians and nine per cent said they weren't interested.\n\nAnother three per cent said they found all parties disappointing, three per cent said their vote wouldn't have counted, two per cent said the polling station was too far away, another two per cent said they didn't receive voter information cards \u2014 and one per cent admitted they were too lazy.", "description": "More than one-third of Canadians voted strategically in last week's federal election to stop another party from winning, a new poll suggests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5339709.1572370081!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20191021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
