From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe exact state of the political weather will be set by the Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday. Agreement on a Brexit deal \u2013 currently looking all but impossible \u2013 would provide Boris Johnson with a fair wind to sail home to a hero\u2019s welcome from the Tory benches.\n\nFar more likely is that he will return empty-handed to face a whirlwind of rage and accusations from all sides of the house, buffeted by Brexiteer demands to sail into the perilous and uncharted waters of no deal at the end of the month, and by calls from the opposition to accept the temporary haven of an extension to Article 50 negotiations to January or June.\n\nThe PM may deploy the lightning strike of a vote to confirm 31 October as the date of Brexit, to force MPs to nail their colours to the mast ahead of an expected general election \u2013 and to attempt to ensure that they take the blame if he gives in to the pressure for delay.\n\nHe could make another bid to trigger an election under fixed-term parliament legislation to test the resolve of opposition parties who say they will not go to the country until no deal is averted.\n\nBut the \u201cRemain alliance\u201d may have thunderbolts of their own, in the shape of a motion to seize control of the agenda and force what they believe could be a successful vote on a second referendum.\n\nMeanwhile, outside Buckingham Palace, the dark storm clouds will be rolling in, in the shape of a People\u2019s Vote march potentially sweeping more than a million people through the streets of the capital to the doors of parliament under the banner Together for the Final Say.\n\nAnd the final thunderclap could come from the courts.\n\nThe prime minister has suggested he will tie himself to the mast and block his ears to the legal and political voices demanding he meet that day\u2019s deadline to sign a letter requesting a Brexit extension.\n\nBut if he does so, he could find his ship sunk by the power of the judges to appoint someone else to do it \u2013 or even the ultimate tsunami of an order from the Queen to remove him from office.\n\nIt is difficult to say just what will be left standing when the day\u2019s gales have abated, and whether the course will be set for no deal, a referendum, an election or just more delay. There is little doubt, however, that the storms of 19 October will reshape the political landscape like few other days in our recent history.\n\nYours,\n\nAndrew Woodcock\n\nPolitical editor", "description": "There have been a lot of turbulent days in Westminster over the past few years, but Saturday 19 October is shaping up to be a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for Brexit.
