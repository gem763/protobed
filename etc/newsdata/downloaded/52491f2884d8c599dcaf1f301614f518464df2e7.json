It wasn\u2019t that he was belittling the racist abuse that was directed against the black English players, but rather the use of two words littering media reports about it.\n\n\u201cBulgaria and racism,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cThe two go hand-in-hand. It\u2019s our reality, we live it every day. I\u2019m sorry for the England players who were targeted but, in truth, this was pretty minor for us.\u201d\n\nTwenty four hours after the England team and their fans departed Sofia, it felt disturbing to stroll around the Bulgarian capital in bright autumnal sunshine speaking with Stefanov and other members of the Roma community. There was unanimous agreement among them that the racial abuse on display in the stadium last Monday night was just a snapshot of the vilification they face every day, which blights their lives. Such is their fear that none of them wanted to be photographed.\n\nA taxi driver by profession, Stefanov, 43, pinches his cheek to indicate his dark complexion as he explains what it is like navigating the streets of the city in which he was born in his bright yellow cab looking for customers.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like this,\u201d he said, pinching my cheek, this time to indicate our shared skin colour. \u201cPeople stop me, look inside and then shout tsiganin [a pejorative term for Gypsy which is also a synonym for lazy or criminal] or blackie. Go away, we don\u2019t want to get inside your stinking cab. I\u2019ve been attacked, spat at and abused,\u201d he said. \u201cThis behaviour against the Roma has become part of our society.\u201d\n\nStefanov\u2019s friend, Miroslav Angelo, lived in Plumstead, south-east London, for five years, where he worked in construction. \u201cBeing in London was like heaven for me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many people of different races and nobody was bothered about me being Roma.\n\n\u201cI felt as if a weight had been lifted off me but Bulgaria feels like prison. We\u2019re blamed for everything because everybody hates us.\u201d\n\nAngelo, 37, revealed that he returned to Bulgaria to look after his elderly parents but dreams of returning to London where he wants to raise his seven-year-old son. Uncertainty over whether he will be able to do this post-Brexit means that his plans are in the balance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England players discuss whether to continue last week\u2019s game with the referee. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images\n\n\u201cThere is no future for the Roma in Bulgaria and things are only going to get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe England players are lucky because they were able to leave. I want to join them because I don\u2019t want my son to be treated like a third-class citizen.\u201d\n\nThe perpetrators of the abuse directed against England players have been identified as members of a group calling itself the Lauta Army, a neo-Nazi hooligan gang that follows Lokomotiv Plovdiv, a team from the country\u2019s second-biggest city. It plays in Bulgaria\u2019s top division in a stadium called Lauta Park. Dressed in black hoodies, the gang gave Nazi salutes and made monkey noises, which prompted Monday\u2019s game to be halted twice, with England players threatening to walk off the pitch at the Vasil Levski Stadium.\n\nThe hooligan gang is well organised and has its own website and runs boxing classes and a gymnasium. It also enjoys connections with other neo-Nazis within European football. Two years ago, it celebrated its 25th anniversary by taking over a Black Sea resort for three days with far-right groups from Italian club Napoli, Spartak Moscow and Bulgarian club Levski Sofia.\n\nThe Lauta Army is just one of many neo-Nazi groups within Bulgarian football who have emerged as the ugly, public face of what the Roma community maintains is visceral intolerance and racism in a country underpinned by elected extreme rightwing politicians.\n\nWhile racist abuse of players inside stadiums attracts attention outside Bulgaria, within the country it is the Roma who are the principal targets of thugs in black and men in suits. The Roma community makes up just under 5% of the country\u2019s population of almost 7 million and is its biggest minority group.\n\nThe government of prime minister Boyko Borissov is propped up by a grouping of three small rightwing populist parties known collectively as the \u201cUnited Patriots\u201d. They are made up of the National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria (NFSB), the Bulgarian National Movement and the Attack party.\n\nKrasimir Karakachanov, head of the Bulgarian National Movement, holds three portfolios \u2013 deputy prime minister, minister for defence and minister for public order and security. His \u201cRoma integration strategy,\u201d or \u201cconcept for the integration of the unsocialised Gypsy (Roma) ethnicity\u201d to give it its formal name, is due to be presented to the Bulgarian parliament and could soon become law.\n\nIt defines Roma as \u201casocial Gypsies,\u201d a term used by the Nazis, and calls for limits on the number of children some Roma women can have; the introduction of compulsory \u201clabour education schools\u201d for Roma children and forced work programmes for sections of the community. It also depicts the Roma as \u201cnon-native Europeans\u201d left over from the Ottoman empire.\n\nHis party\u2019s manifesto also calls for the creation of \u201creservations\u201d for Roma based on the model used for Native Americans or Indigenous Australians, claiming that they could become \u201ctourist attractions\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, following violence between Bulgarian Roma and non-Roma, Karakachanov declared: \u201cThe truth is that we need to undertake a complete programme for a solution to the Gypsy problem.\u201d\n\nHis predecessor as deputy prime minister Valeri Simeonov described the Roma as \u201carrogant, presumptuous and ferocious humanoids\u201d. He was also chair of Bulgaria\u2019s National Council for Cooperation on Ethnic and Integration Issues at the time.\n\nFollowing elections in 2017, which saw the trio of far-right parties emerge as key players in Bulgaria\u2019s government, campaigners claim that hate crimes and rhetoric against the Roma have intensified.\n\nIncidents include anti-Roma riots; demolition of Roma homes deemed \u201cillegal\u201d; police raids and deaths in custody; and members of the community in rural areas killed while out collecting firewood.\n\nZvezdomir Andronov, leader of the Bulgarian National Union, an ultra-right party which is not represented in parliament, was recently a guest on one of the country\u2019s most popular political talk shows, where he said: \u201cGypsies, Turks, Armenians and Jews are guests in Bulgaria and if they are good guests, they can live peacefully here.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Four men arrested by Bulgarian police after the game. Photograph: AP\n\nJonathan Lee, spokesman for the European Roma Rights Centre, said: \u201cUnfortunately, racist chanting and offensive gestures from the terraces is not even close to as bad as it gets in Bulgaria. Last Monday night, Europe was confronted with what for most Roma in the country is the everyday. Rising anti-Gypsyism, decline of the rule of law, and increasingly fascist political rhetoric is nothing new \u2013 it just rarely gets such a public stage.\u201d\n\nLee added: \u201cThis is an EU member state where violent race mobs are the norm, police violence is sudden and unpredictable, punitive demolitions of people\u2019s homes are the appropriate government response, random murders of Romany citizens only a fleeting headline, and the rights and dignity of Romany citizens are routinely denied on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nThe events of Monday night have also exposed the deep fault lines within Bulgarian society, with some of its white citizens viewing things very differently from their Roma counterparts. One local journalist shouted \u201cexaggerated, exaggerated,\u201d as the chairman of England\u2019s Football Association revealed details of the racist abuse during a post-match press conference.\n\nAnother blamed England manager Gareth Southgate for initially raising fears about racism, which he insisted, incited some Bulgarians to respond.\n\nSitting in a cafe in Sofia, football fan Robert Cvetanov added: \u201cYou cannot say the whole of Bulgaria is racist just because of what a small group of people did in the stadium. There is good and bad in every country.\u201d When asked about the situation of the Roma he replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not a race problem, it\u2019s a law and order one.\u201d\n\nThe repercussions of Bulgaria\u2019s encounter with England continue to be felt. Police have so far identified 16 suspects and made 12 arrests for their part in the racial abuse that took place. Uefa, European football\u2019s governing body, has initiated an inquiry and charged Bulgaria with racist behaviour by its fans.\n\nBut for the Roma community there is a far bigger game at play that requires more than just the attention of footballing and legal authorities if they are to take their rightful place within Bulgarian society. \u201cThe eyes of the world have been opened,\u201d said Stefanov. \u201cIt\u2019s just that most of Bulgaria does not see it and until that happens, nothing will change for the Roma.\u201d", "description": "After racism marred the football, Romany people tell of the abuse they suffer and of anti-Gypsy campaigns at the highest levels", "authors": ["Vivek Chaudhary"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a0c6c8905ff375b893a8ad3792c4b5efc7dfa99/0_0_2302_1381/master/2302.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=55b8134ca199363dca7e64194efa7c47", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
