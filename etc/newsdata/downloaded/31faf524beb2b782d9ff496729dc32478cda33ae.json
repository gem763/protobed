It\u2019s where Jesus speaks of how he longs to set the world aflame with his message and, at the same time, warns that this will cause great division \u2014 even division within families.\n\nThese are not words we expect to hear from his lips, nor do we particularly like them. Given human nature, we tend to prefer religious messages of the \u201cfeel good\u201d variety. I can tell you from long pastoral experience that people love singing, \u201cLet There Be Peace on Earth,\u201d a Broadway-style pop song that\u2019s found its place in hymnals of just about all churches.\n\nThe Lord was never what you\u2019d call \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d however. His words don\u2019t reflect peacefulness as expressed in that song. And by the time Luke was recounting them in his Gospel \u2014 around the year 75 \u2014 those divisions which Jesus had predicted were well evident in Jewish and pagan families alike.\n\nConversions to the New Faith were creating deep stresses between parents and children, between siblings or with other relatives, even between husbands and wives. And for very real and tangible reasons: a family\u2019s status, its wealth, its place in society, its security were all very much affected by the exercise of certain key religious practices.\n\nEspecially in Roman society, a family member who departed from the mos maiorum (the customs of the ancestors) by becoming Christian raised serious questions about that family\u2019s cultic loyalty.\n\nConcern for maintaining a family\u2019s faith identity is still a reality. I\u2019ve encountered this frequently when counseling young people who wish to marry across religious lines and find themselves confronting long-established family traditions.\n\nJesus\u2019 words about division were as cautionary as they were evangelistic. He was calling on people to make a choice \u2014 and to be prepared for the consequences of that choice.\n\nThose who hear the Gospel message now face the same situation. In a way, being a Christian is no easier these days than it was in biblical times.\n\nAs the standards of the early church were in opposition to those of Rome, Christianity today proposes a way of living that differs from the enticements of current popular culture. Following the Lord is still divisive. It requires a willingness to take risks and to endure criticism.\n\nThis was demonstrated recently by a Polish lad named Jakub Baryla. The 15-year-old took deep offense at Poland\u2019s celebration of LGBT \u201cpride,\u201d which he saw as inconsistent with the faith of that very Catholic country (promotion of the event included a number of blasphemous images and presentations).\n\nHe stood in the path of a \u201cpride\u201d parade in the city of Plock, obstructing the march and holding a crucifix and rosary. Images of the police picking him up and carrying him out of the way have \u201cgone viral.\u201d\n\nJakub has been accused of seeking publicity on which to build a political career. But he insists he\u2019s not interested in personal recognition. He wishes to become a priest, and he took such a public stand only because, \u201cI wanted as many people as possible to see my gesture. I wanted [God] to make them reflect and discuss.\u201d\n\nIn England, a 10-year-old girl named Kelsey and her classmate, a boy named Farrell, were suspended from school for being \u201chomophobic\u201d and asking to be excused from LGBT-focused lessons offered during \u201cPride Month.\u201d\n\nKelsey, who is from a Pentecostal family, explained that she didn\u2019t know what the word, \u201chomophobic\u201d meant, but that, \u201cI think that they are trying to confuse children. Before all this happened, they [her schoolmates] were completely confident of who they were, but now they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nMichael Bowman, a software developer in Oregon, has refused to pay his taxes since 1999, because the government provides funding for abortion, which he strenuously opposes. He\u2019s undergone a long legal battle and scored some technical successes. But he\u2019s very likely to lose in the end.\n\nThis is a man who\u2019s put his personal fortune where his principles are, even risking jail.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not encouraging anyone to disrupt parades or to not pay their taxes. Such dramatic acts of defiance aren\u2019t for everybody.\n\nI am encouraging you to seek the truth and to be attentive to what your children or grandchildren are learning in school. A young fellow came to me some time ago to tell me about how he got into trouble in school for using the wrong pronoun when referring to a boy who was \u201ctransitioning\u201d into a \u201cgirl.\u201d\n\nSchools are teaching such things these days \u2014 things that not only contradict our faith but that ignore simple reality. That\u2019s the kind of society in which we live.\n\nYou mustn\u2019t be afraid to challenge the schools when such insanity occurs, or to challenge any authority, for that matter. Stand up for what\u2019s right. Speak the truth in love.\n\nJust know that there are risks. That\u2019s what Jesus meant when he was talking about division. If you\u2019re a Christian, you can\u2019t go through life unscathed. There are always a few bumps and bruises.\n\nAnd of course, some people do become actual martyrs for the faith.\n\nIn our \u201cpolitically correct\u201d era, with the media so given over to propaganda, with social pressure so strong and sensitivities so heightened, the tendency is to \u201cgo with the flow.\u201d But to quote an old saying from the 1960s, the only thing that really goes with the flow is sewage.\n\nChristians are called to do better. We\u2019re called to be a light in this confused and gloomy age.\n\nRecall the motto of The Christophers, that famous Catholic evangelistic society: \u201cIt\u2019s better to light one candle than to curse the darkness.\u201d\n\nLet your light shine.\n\n\u2022 Michael P.
