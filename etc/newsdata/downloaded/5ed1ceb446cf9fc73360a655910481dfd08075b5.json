the border after pounding suspected Kurdish-held areas with air strikes (Pictures: Reuters/IHA)\n\nTurkey\u2019s soldiers crossed the border into Syria to battle Kurdish fighters hours after Turkish warplanes pounded areas in the north of the country.\n\nThousands of Turkish troops have been joined by allied Syrian opposition forces for the offensive, Turkey\u2019s defence ministry said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the airstrikes and ground attack on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon, naming it \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019.\n\nIt came after President Donald Trump agreed to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, paving the way for an assault on forces that have long been allied with the US.\n\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, said Turkish warplanes were targeting \u2018civilian areas\u2019, causing \u2018a huge panic\u2019 in the region.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has this morning said the US did not give Turkey a \u2018green light\u2019 to begin its attack on northern Syria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Pompeo defended President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from the border area, which has sparked an outcry at home and abroad.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5

terror\u2019 to its country.\n\nPresident Erdogan said he wanted to prevent \u2018the creation of a terror corridor\u2019 on the border with his country.\n\nTurkish forces plan to make a \u2018safe zone\u2019 cleared of Kurdish militias which will house Syrian refugees.\n\nBut Kurdish-led forces \u2013 who helped the US defeat Islamic State (Isis) in Syria \u2013 vowed to resist the offensive and have already clashed with Turkish troops.\n\nThe Kurds guard thousands of Isis fighters and their relatives in prisons and camps in areas under their control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is unclear whether they will continue to do so if battles break out.\n\nUS President Donald Trump called the strikes on Kurdish fighters in Syria

towns under attack from Turkish forces, Ras al-Ayn, is a residential area where civilians live.\n\nPanic began on the streets of the town as airstrikes broke out, with cars racing to safety.\n\nIt was not clear if they were leaving the town or heading away from the Syrian border where the conflict has broken out.\n\nNear the town of Qamishli, plumes of smoke were seen rising from an area close to the border after activists reported sounds of an explosion nearby.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at eight, including two Christian Assyrians in the city of Qamishli, a husband and wife and their child as well as another man in a village outside of the town of Tal Abyad, and a child in a village west of Qamishli.\n\nAlso killed was a man in Ras al-Ayn, it said.\n\nThe Observatory said at least seven fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces were killed in the fighting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kurdish forces have warned of a \u2018humanitarian catastrophe\u2019 that could potentially unfold because of the Turkish military operation.\n\nMr Erdogan said in a tweet: \u2018Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border and to bring peace to the area.\u2019\n\nHis \u2018Peace Spring\u2019 operation involves Turkish Armed Forces fighting alongside Turkish-backed Syrian fighters known as the Syrian National Army, the president said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the offensive on Twitter (Picture: EPA)\n\nA spokesman for the US-backed Kurdish-led

before Mr Erdogan\u2019s announcement, activists said.\n\nThe sound of explosions could be heard in Turkey, with activists saying it was difficult to know what was hit in the first hours of the operation.\n\nIt is feared Turkey\u2019s attack will ignite new fighting in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war, potentially displacing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nMr Trump has threatened to \u2018totally destroy and obliterate\u2019 Turkey\u2019s economy if the Turkish offensive in Syria \u2018went too far\u2019.\n\nYesterday he said the US does not endorse the assault on northern Syria and has made it clear to Ankara that its incursion against Kurdish fighters who helped the US fight so-called Isis is a \u2018bad idea\u2019.\n\nHe face criticism for abandoning an American ally in his decision to withdraw US troops from the area.\n\nMr Trump argue he does not want the US to fight \u2018these endless, senseless wars\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnited Nations diplomats say the UN Security Council will hold a closed meeting today to discuss Turkey\u2019s military action.\n\nThe UK, along with France, Germany, Belgium and Poland, requested the meeting on Wednesday, the diplomats
