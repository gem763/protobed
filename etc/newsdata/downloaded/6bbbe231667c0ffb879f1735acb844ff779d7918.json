The average tenure of a CIO is roughly four years at one company, according to executive search firm Korn Ferry.\n\nBut the approach can come with unexpected risks, analysts say. Being too loyal to a tech partner can reduce a company\u2019s flexibility to pivot as technology, markets or business models change. By being too wedded to certain tools, CIOs can miss out on new ones or on lower prices for similar applications.\n\nTech tools that worked well at one company aren\u2019t always the right fit for another, said Stephanie Stoudt-Hansen, a senior research director at research and advisory firm Gartner Inc.\n\nSteven Capper, CIO at Netherlands-based construction company BAM Groep NV, said he prefers to go with trusted vendors \u201cthat you have used and can rely on,\u201d adding, \u201cThe main role of a CIO is to ensure that IT works. It makes sense to use your own playbook.\u201d\n\nVendor relationships \u201coften travel together,\u201d especially when they have developed into long-term partnerships, said Steve Bates, who leads the CIO Center of Excellence at accounting firm KPMG LLP.\n\nPart of Google\u2019s strategy in the enterprise IT space has been to foster these kinds of partnerships with CIOs, in part by building up customer services and working with companies on solving business problems, Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud\u2019s chief executive, told CIOs this month at the Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo in Orlando.\n\nMs. Anstett agrees there is no one-size-fits-all in enterprise IT: \u201cThe last thing any company wants is some external tech leader to come in with all the answers,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Iron Mountain CIO said she is working with the Boston-based company\u2019s business divisions to help prepare its 25,000 workers for the switch to G Suite. Feedback from a 30-person implementation team will be used to make tweaks in the strategy ahead of the rollout, which she said she expects to be complete within seven months.\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "Kim Anstett liked Google\u2019s cloud tools so much while CIO at Nielsen that she decided to roll them out at document-storage company Iron Mountain.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-122335/social", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
