It expects sales of around EUR43.5 billion and Ebitda before special items to be around EUR11.5 billion.\n\nAs of Oct. 11, the company faces lawsuits from around 42,700 plaintiffs in cases relating to its subsidiary Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller, up from around 18,400 in July.\n\nWrite to Kim Richters at kim.richters@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 03:16 ET (07:16 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
