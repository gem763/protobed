Katie Porter of California asked Zuckerberg on Wednesday during a hearing by the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cYes, that is correct,\u201d he answered.\n\ncaption Rep. Katie Porter of California. source YouTube\n\nThe moderators are also said to experience difficult working conditions beyond the taxing work they perform.\n\n\u201cAccording to one report I have, and this is straight out of an episode of \u2018Black Mirror,\u2019 these workers get nine minutes of supervised wellness time per day,\u201d Porter told Zuckerberg. \u201cThat means nine minutes to cry in the stairwell while someone watches them.\u201d\n\nBefore Zuckerberg could respond, Porter asked: \u201cWould you be willing to commit to spending one hour per day for the next year watching these videos and acting as a content monitor, and only accessing the same benefits available to your workers?\u201d\n\nRead more: Mark Zuckerberg calls reports of Facebook content moderators suffering PTSD after watching videos of people dying \u2018a little overdramatic\u2019\n\nWithout answering the question, Zuckerberg pointed to what he characterized as the \u201cgood benefits\u201d available to Facebook\u2019s content moderators. But Porter cut him off.\n\n\u201cMr. Zuckerberg, I\u2019m looking for a yes or a no,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you be willing to act as a content monitor? To have that life experience?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that it would best serve our community for me to spend that much time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I spend a lot of time looking at this content.\u201d Porter cut him off once again. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re not qualified to be a content moderator?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo, congresswoman, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d he responded.
