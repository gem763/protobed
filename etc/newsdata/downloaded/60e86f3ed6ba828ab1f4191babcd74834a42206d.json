After the Roy family gathers on a yacht in the Mediterranean to choose their blood sacrifice, Logan Roy picks his son Kendall to take the fall for Waystar Royco\u2019s cruise scandal \u2014 unless he actually picks him to commit patricide? It all depends on how you see Logan\u2019s ever-so-slight grin in the episode\u2019s final shot, as he watches Kendall declare his father a cancer to the family\u2019s empire, implicating him in the scandal that threatens to destroy the company he built. \u201cLogan is really setting Kendall up to become the man he has not been,\u201d Cox says. The smile, then, is a moment of pride.\n\nSuccession\u2019s second season concluded Sunday night, but the 73-year-old actor has a busy week ahead: In glasses and a South Texas drawl, he\u2019s currently starring as Lyndon B. Johnson in The Great Society on Broadway. The play, Robert Schenkkan\u2019s sequel to All the Way, doesn\u2019t have a lot of victories: In The Great Society, LBJ is embroiled in the Vietnam War, has shouting matches with Martin Luther King Jr. about integration, and quarrels with Bobby Kennedy over the 1968 election. Over the phone recently, Cox talked about the parallels between the irascible Roy patriarch and the towering good ol\u2019 boy president. \u201cWhen you listen to these wonderful DVDs called The LBJ Tapes, as I did in my research, they were fascinating about how Johnson operated. I was very much taken by that. [The Great Society] seemed to be a no-brainer, though quite frankly, I could\u2019ve done with a little bit more leeway,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m going between Logan Roy and LBJ!\u201d Vulture talked to Cox about his presidential run on Broadway, the shocking twist at the end of Succession\u2019s finale, and why the white male is past his \u201csell-by date.\u201d\n\nWhen you found out how Succession would end this season, what was your first thought?\n\nIt was inevitable but surprising, in terms of Kendall having been so careful through the whole second season. He\u2019s shied away from his strength, Kendall has. Logan knew in order to sacrifice himself, he would have to do it through his family. He figured that the one chance he had was to make Kendall into the killer. That\u2019s why, at the end, he smiles. He\u2019s achieved what he was after. \u201cMy son has come of age. He\u2019s now officially a killer.\u201d [Laughs.]\n\nTell me more about that smile in the final shot.\n\nIt was gratifying to play because once Logan received the death sentence, it was important to him who\u2019d deliver the death. He wanted to keep it within the family, as opposed to it coming from outside of the family. The smile is him saying, \u201cFinally, my son is stepping up to the plate, doing what he needs to do to run a business. Finally, he\u2019s the heir apparent to Waystar Royco.\u201d In a way, it\u2019s a completion. But there\u2019s life in the old dog yet! We\u2019ve got quite a journey now. Logan has to reclaim himself. He needs to even the odds.\n\nBut why Kendall? Why do you think Logan trusted Kendall to deliver that death sentence over Shiv or Roman?\n\nRoman\u2019s not such a \u2014 excuse the expression \u2014 fuck knuckle as people make him out to be. There\u2019s more to Roman than meets the eye. He\u2019s actually compassionate. It\u2019s wonderful to see him defend Gerri in that episode. The way he questions what has just happened to him in Turkey, the way he sees through that [bad deal]. Roman has a particular vision, which Logan acknowledges.\n\nHe\u2019s certainly not going to set up Siobhan to do it, because she\u2019s in a fragile state in terms of her own marriage. Logan\u2019s eldest son, Connor, God bless him, is far too much of a flake! [Laughs.] He would\u2019ve taken the hit only for the money. It\u2019s very, very thought through, very carefully done.\n\nDo you see Logan as the malignant presence the shareholders seem to think he is?\n\nOf course I don\u2019t. They\u2019ve had good times, the shareholders have. They\u2019ve done very well off of Logan Roy. His fault was that he turned a blind eye. It was also a fault of the time. These assaults, this whole cruises thing, happened many years before, but he overlooked it. That\u2019s what\u2019s undone him. He himself is actually quite Puritan. He says it\u2019s hard for him to take his own shirt off with his wife! He has not attended to what was vile within his firm, with Mo Lester and all of that. Logan\u2019s a bastard, but he\u2019s not an indecent bastard.\n\nTell me this: How many times did Matthew Macfadyen have to snatch that chicken from your plate and take a bite from it?\n\n[Laughs] He had to only do it a couple of times. They cut a wonderful bit, which quite rightly was edited out, where Matthew walks away and has a moment of panic. He says, \u201cIs he looking? What\u2019s he doing? What\u2019s the old boy doing?\u201d They cut those lines, but it was quite good.\n\nDo you think Marcia will come back to Logan?\n\nI hope it will happen. He clearly loves Marcia. There\u2019s this idea that he had this affair with Rhea, but I\u2019m not sure that happened. Both Holly [Hunter] and I felt that hadn\u2019t actually happened, that it was more in the minds of the kids. He does ask her to stay the night, but that was because he had plenty of rooms. His sell-by date on that sort of thing is near. The kids thinking they were having an affair was more them projecting.\n\nThat\u2019s fascinating. The general consensus seems to be that Rhea and Logan were having an affair.\n\nOf course people think that! That tells you more about those people than what actually happened. [Laughs.] That\u2019s the giveaway. That\u2019s frailty in human nature, I\u2019m afraid.\n\nLogan makes Kendall kick Naomi off the yacht. Was that Pierce-family resentment, or does something about her specifically set him off?\n\nThere was a scene where I actually talk to her. I hated the scene, it never made any sense [because] he would never talk to her directly. It was a family affair, and she was intruding. There wasn\u2019t a reason for her to be there. The problem with her and Kendall, to Logan, is that they\u2019re both addicts. He doesn\u2019t necessarily think that will add up to a good relationship. I\u2019m sure he understands that Kendall may love her, but given the fact that Kendall has to go into a new life, Naomi Pierce is not going to help.\n\nWould Logan ever see Willa\u2019s Broadway play, Sands?\n\nAbsolutely not. Absolutely not!\n\nI\u2019ll admit Sands was my favorite subplot this season. I want to see it!\n\nI think his theatrical interests are at a minimum. He\u2019d wish her well and good luck, but that\u2019s it. I\u2019m really curious about it, though. I want to know how good the play is. It may not be as bad as people have made out. I think there\u2019s something quite considerable about Willa. She can\u2019t be counted out. This is a girl who has tried to be a writer, she was forced to become an escort to [subsidize] her talent. In a way, I\u2019m understanding of that. She might be a talent, but it\u2019s a first-time play. She might be an extraordinary playwright for all we know!\n\nYou should never believe critics. They\u2019re the last people you should believe. They\u2019ve always got their own agenda. The problem with critics is that they\u2019re [either] a force for good or they\u2019re frustrated in their own lives. They\u2019re naysayers. I think theatrical criticism has completely evaporated in the last years without Brooks Atkinson, Ken Tynan, [Harold] Hobson. I\u2019m old enough to realize how great theater criticism was.\n\nYou have to tell me how luxurious that yacht was in real life.\n\nOh, ridiculously luxurious. I don\u2019t know where it came from, but it was ridiculously luxurious.\n\nI was talking to your Succession co-star Arian Moayed on opening night of The Great Society, and he said that you told him about the play right before you guys jumped into the Adriatic Sea together. Is that true?\n\nYeah, right before jumping into the Adriatic Sea, it was mentioned to me that this play was happening. At that time, it was going to be a dramatized reading. And then it ended up as what you saw.\n\nWhat makes LBJ and this period of time interesting to you?\n\nAmerica has a checkered history, and it doesn\u2019t ever quite own up to it. That\u2019s what I loved about about Deadwood, the use of that lawlessness in terms of the Indian Wars. What I love about [Great Society playwright] Robert Schenkkan is that he really looked at Johnson, he really wanted to evaluate Johnson, to clear the debris that surrounded Johnson. Johnson did something that no other president could do. Great visionaries have a sense of the world at the grassroots, and Johnson certainly had that.\n\nDo you think all powerful men have something in common? You\u2019ve played a lot of them.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird thing. As I get older \u2014 I\u2019m still surviving, I\u2019m still here \u2014 those parts become the key roles. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to play them. I think it\u2019s actually a reflection of my classical background, really, that\u2019s allowed me the entry into those roles. They\u2019re fascinating guys. The other thing now, especially in this age of diversity, they are like the white dinosaurs. There\u2019s something fascinating and curious about that, dramatically.\n\nLogan really bristles at that dinosaur label, and LBJ consciously made an effort to not be seen that way, no?\n\nExactly. Nobody thinks of themselves as dinosaurs. I\u2019m talking about the objective view, but increasingly, it\u2019s a world where the white male is past his sell-by date.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of premonition about [The Great Society]. Robert has really tried to say, \u201cYou have to look at this guy.\u201d Joseph Califano, who was domestic adviser to Johnson, came to see the show last night. He was raving about it and said, \u201cMy God, you\u2019ve got him, you understand the guy.\u201d He told me this wonderful story \u2014 and this is so typical of Johnson! \u2014 Califano had this son, Joe III. When Joe III was a little boy, he swallowed a whole bottle of aspirin. It was a panic within the household, and they had to pump it out. Johnson said, [uses Texas accent] \u201cWhere you been? I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to find you all mornin\u2019!\u201d Califano said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. President, my son just swallowed a whole bottle of aspirin.\u201d Johnson said, \u201cHe swallowed a whole bottle of \u2014 oh, I gotta deal with that now!\u201d [Laughs.] So Johnson drafted up a bill. When you see a safety cap on a medicine bottle, that was Johnson.\n\nI didn\u2019t know that.\n\nThere\u2019s certain things that really get me about Johnson. I love the fact that he was a schoolteacher. That\u2019s how he started out. He would\u2019ve been horrified by what\u2019s going on at the border, because that\u2019s where he was! That\u2019s where his schoolkids were, that\u2019s where his school was.\n\nMy personal favorite is how he looked. He looked like my dad. My dad wasn\u2019t tall, but they [both] had the dark-brown eyes, dark-brown hair. They could\u2019ve been brothers. I was always predisposed to Johnson because he looked like my dad. [Laughs.]\n\nWhen you\u2019re about to go onstage, do you see your dad in yourself?\n\nYeah, I can see the old man. My dad was slightly better looking than I was, but yeah. [Laughs.]\n\nHow did you do get the southern accent down?\n\nI got it from the tapes. When you listen to the tapes, he talks to people differently. There\u2019s a wonderful conversation between him and Jackie Kennedy about a month after the assassination. Jackie, she wasn\u2019t a boo-hooer. She was in a state of shock after, as you see clearly in that famous picture of Johnson being sworn in and Jackie still standing there with a blood-stained outfit. A month afterward, he\u2019s talking to Jackie and he\u2019s very warm and she completely melts with him. It\u2019s extraordinary when you hear it. She does this very revealing thing; she says, \u201cI just want to thank you. You\u2019ve written to me more than Jack ever wrote to me!\u2019 That was who Johnson was. And he was a bit of a lady\u2019s man, as history has revealed.\n\nSuccession is a show about the superrich. What\u2019s your biggest extravagance?\n\nMy biggest extravagance? My biggest extravagance is probably having an ice cream. [Laughs.] I like vanilla. You know what a brown cow is?\n\nNo, what\u2019s that?\n\nA brown cow is ice cream and Coca-Cola. I have it with Coke Zero \u2014 I can\u2019t take it any other way because I\u2019m diabetic.\n\nThe Roys were barely in New York this season. Which location was your favorite?\n\nIt was wonderful going back home to my hometown, which was completely unexpected. To have an episode called \u201cDundee\u201d is pretty amazing. I\u2019m very fond of my hometown. It\u2019s been a tough town, and it was a tough town. Winston Churchill was our MP, and we threw him out! Quite rightly, because he did a lot of strange things. I love going back to Dundee. But I do have to say, swimming in the Adriatic was pretty unbeatable.
