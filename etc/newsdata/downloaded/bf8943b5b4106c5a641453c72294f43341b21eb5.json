It was the second such raid in two months.\n\nFerrer\u2019s wife, Nelva Ortega, was allowed to visit Ferrer on October 4, but neither she nor anyone else has been given any proof of life since then.\n\nThe NGO Freedom House demanded this week that the Cuban communist regime free Ferrer, who already served seven years as a political prisoner following his arrest in what is now known as the 2003 \u201cblack spring.\u201d\n\nThe Cuban regime has not publicly charged Ferrer with any crime or commented on his arrest. Pro-communist accounts on Twitter began circulating a video this week accusing Ferrer of being a \u201cmurderer\u201d without providing any evidence.\n\nCarlos Amel Oliva, an UNPACU youth leader, told Diario de Cuba on Tuesday that Ortega went to visit her husband and was told he was not at the Aguadores prison where she had been told he was being kept.\n\n\u201cAt the door where they receive family, the official who attended to them began looking through the list of inmates and Jos\u00e9 Daniel wasn\u2019t at the prison,\u201d Oliva said. \u201cThe official made a gesture like he had put his foot in his mouth and called his superiors. After 40 minutes, they sent Ortega to an office and told her she would not receive the visit.\u201d\n\nOliva said Ortega got agitated by the news and the soldiers controlling the prison \u201charassed her and intended to strip search her,\u201d Diario de Cuba reported. They later confiscated her telephone and told her she was banned from the prison for at least a year.\n\nFerrer\u2019s situation is particularly alarming because he suffers from several physical ailments that require regular medical care, including \u201can ulcer and has a serious problem in an infected tooth caused by a beating he received from police officers in another long-term arbitrary detention,\u201d the NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders said in their protest to the United Nations Human Rights Council sent to the international body on Saturday.\n\nThe beating they refer to occurred after his arrest and beating in August, in which UNPACU members say police again looted their headquarters and stole medicine from their cabinets. Cuba is currently suffering a medical crisis as the communist regime has failed to keep basic medicines stocked in pharmacies used by non-elites.\n\n\u201cSince his release [following the 2003 seven-year sentence] from prison under \u2018extrapenal license,\u2019 with limited movement and the original sentence still in force, Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer has been detained more than 100 times without charges (more than once a month since 8 years ago),\u201d Cuban Prisoners Defenders noted to the U.N., \u201cmost of the time in an extremely violent way, with brutal beatings, threats and assaults on his house on dozens of occasions, subtracting all his personal belongings, whether technological material and communications means or food, household goods, books, or furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the last events have taken place, Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer remained detained and incommunicado, even as we have described with no known whereabouts or signs of him, not only from day 1 until October 4, the only and last time the family has seen him alive or had any contact with him, but also since that day,\u201dthe group noted.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday through its Latin America and the Caribbean programs director, Deborah Ullmer, Freedom House demanded that the Cuban regime \u201cimmediately and unconditionally release Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer, the UNPACU members arrested with him, and all prisoners of conscience\u201d: \u201cThe arrest and detention of these activists without an explanation of the charges against them is alarming, even more so considering that one of those detained is a minor.\u201d The minor is Ferrer\u2019s 16-year-old son, who has since been released.\n\nFreedom House joined Amnesty International, which condemned the Cuban communist regime last week for having \u201charassed and intimidated Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer Garc\u00eda for more than a decade due to his political activism.\u201d\n\nOliva, the UNPACU youth director, confirmed to Mart\u00ed Noticias Tuesday that no one has seen Ferrer since Ortega visited him on October 4, and there is no public confirmation that he is safe and healthy.\n\nThe Castro regime \u2013 still commandeered by dictator Ra\u00fal Castro \u2013 denies the existence of political prisoners on the island. Castro was last asked about the prisoners in 2016, when President Barack Obama visited Cuba, to which he responded, simply, \u201cWhat political prisoners?\u201d\n\nCuban Prisoners Defenders has certified the existence of at least 126 political prisoners in Cuba, 50 of them members of UNPACU.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) denounced the disappearance Tuesday of its leader, Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer, from prison records.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Jose\u0301-Daniel-Ferrer-hand-up-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
