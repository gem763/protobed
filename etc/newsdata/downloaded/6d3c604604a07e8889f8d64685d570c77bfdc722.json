Tulsi Gabbard speaks during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) slammed CNN and the New York Times during Tuesday evening\u2019s debate, which the two outlets co-hosted, accusing both of smearing her by attributing her call for an end to the \u201cregime-change war\u201d in Syria to a nefarious allegiance to Russia.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling to an end to this regime-change war,\u201d Gabbard told the crowd in Ohio.\n\n\u201cJust two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying I am a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,\u201d the Hawaii Democrat continued. \u201cThis morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\u201d\n\nA Times article published October 12 accused Gabbard of \u201cdefending the brutal Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad.\u201d Hours before the debate, a CNN analyst called the senator a \u201cpuppet for the Russian government.\u201d\n\nGabbard also blamed President Trump for ordering the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, a move that has garnered bipartisan criticism.\n\n\u201cThe slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime-change war that we\u2019ve been waging in Syria,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cDonald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand \u2014 but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.\u201d\n\nGabbard added that she would end \u201cregime-change\u201d wars in the region by ceasing \u201cdraconian sanctions,\u201d which she called a \u201cmodern-day siege.\u201d\n\nTrump announced earlier this month that the U.S. will pull back troops currently stationed in the northern part of Syria, saying he does not want the U.S. to \u201cpolice\u201d the area any longer. However, he vowed to punish Turkey if the country takes any action the U.S. considers \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\nBipartisan critics of the move warned that a U.S. troop withdrawal would make room for expected Turkish invasion of the region and would leave the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been supported by U.S troops in fighting the Islamic State, open to attack.\n\nThe Kurds \u201care fighting a force that intends to eliminate their people because we green lighted their operation,\u201d a senior U.S. defense official said.", "description": "Rep.
