Sondland is set to be deposed before House investigators in the Ukraine probe. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, intends to tell Congress this week that the content of a text message he wrote denying a quid pro quo with Ukraine was relayed to him directly by President Trump in a phone call, according to a person familiar with his testimony.\n\nSondland plans to tell lawmakers he has no knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth at that moment. \u201cIt\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u201d said the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters.\n\nThe Sept. 9 exchange between Sondland and the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine has become central to the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into whether the president abused his office in pressuring Ukraine to open an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and his son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The White House and its defenders have held up Sondland\u2019s text, which included \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d as proof that none was ever considered.\n\n[Read the text message excerpts between U.S. diplomats, Giuliani and a Ukrainian aide]\n\nSondland will hold out the possibility that Trump wasn\u2019t truthful in his denial of a quid pro quo as well as an alternative scenario in which the president\u2019s interest in the scheme soured at a time when his administration faced mounting scrutiny over why it was withholding about $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine and delaying a leader-level visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cWhether he\u2019s deciding it\u2019s getting too hot to handle and he backs off whatever his position really was a month earlier, I don\u2019t know,\u201d the person said of Sondland\u2019s understanding.\n\nHours before Sondland called the president, he received a text message from the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor, raising questions about the aid holdup. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor texted Sondland.\n\nThat\u2019s when Sondland, according to the person\u2019s understanding, called Trump, who then told him he didn\u2019t \u201cwant a quid pro quo . . . didn\u2019t want anything from Ukraine.\u201d The call lasted less than five minutes, and Trump appeared to be in a foul mood, according to the person, who spoke to The Post with Sondland\u2019s permission, an intermediary said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. Sondland declined to comment through his lawyers.\n\nSondland, who has emerged as a central actor in Trump\u2019s efforts to persuade Ukraine to open investigations, will be deposed before House investigators on Thursday.\n\nSondland is expected to say that for months before the Sept. 9 message, he worked at the direction of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, to secure what he would call in another text message the \u201cdeliverable\u201d sought by Trump: a public statement from Ukraine that it would investigate corruption, including mentioning Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, by name. In exchange for the statement, the president would grant Ukraine\u2019s new president a coveted White House audience.\n\n\u201cIt was a quid pro quo, but not a corrupt one,\u201d the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony said.\n\nSondland appears poised to say that he and other diplomats did not know that the request to mention Burisma was really an effort to impugn the reputations of Biden and his son Hunter, who had served as a Burisma board member. Sondland contends that he didn\u2019t know about the Biden connection until a whistleblower complaint and transcript surfaced in late September.\n\nTo trust Sondland\u2019s testimony, members of Congress will have to believe Sondland had not seen televised appearances by Giuliani over the spring and summer, or numerous newspaper and magazine articles questioning whether Hunter Biden\u2019s role at Burisma could prove to be a drag on his father\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cIf people find that incredulous, it strikes me that the incredulity is hindsight bias,\u201d said the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony. \u201cThe things that seem so clear to people now didn\u2019t seem so clear in real time.\u201d\n\nThe testimony by Sondland, a Portland hotelier who gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee through four of his limited liability companies, could prove damaging to Giuliani and the president.\n\nFor months, Sondland\u2019s deep involvement in issues related to Ukraine struck diplomats in Brussels and Washington as highly unusual, given his role as envoy to the European Union, a large trade bloc that does not include Ukraine. Former U.S. officials have said Sondland viewed the Ukraine assignment as critical to winning Trump\u2019s favor and auditioning for a more senior job in the administration.\n\nIn Sondland\u2019s account, he describes an assignment that begins with excitement and enthusiasm and ends with concern about how the Trump administration was pressing Ukraine, a country fending off Russian-backed separatists that relies heavily on the United States for economic and military support.\n\nBesides working with Giuliani, Sondland also partnered with Kurt Volker, special envoy to Ukraine, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The three men were all part of the U.S. delegation to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May and left that ceremony excited about the prospects for a vibrant new American partner in Ukraine, according to Sondland\u2019s perspective.\n\nThe three returned to Washington intent on pressing Trump to meet quickly with Zelensky. But instead of receiving a positive reception, the idea was met with a \u201cbuzz saw\u201d in the Oval Office, the person said. Trump was disgruntled about Ukraine, blaming opponents in the country for attempting to undermine his 2016 victory.\n\n\u201cTrump was saying Ukraine \u2018tried to do me in.\u2019 \u201d The three surmised that Giuliani had filled Trump\u2019s head with a number of baseless conspiracy theories, including that a hacked server belonging to the Democratic National Committee was spirited away to Ukraine. Perry, Sondland and Volker each took a turn trying to move Trump to no avail. The president ended the meeting saying: \u201cIf you want to do something you have to talk to Rudy.\u201d\n\nVolker would take the lead in trying to iron out Giuliani\u2019s wishes, starting a three-month exchange of messages over WhatsApp, which were released this month.\n\nSondland is prepared to say he had a very limited role over the summer. He did not speak directly to Giuliani until Aug. 1, the person said. And because of his job in Brussels, he \u201cwas not the central connection.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, in conversations with The Washington Post, has described Sondland\u2019s role as more expansive, saying he spoke with Sondland about six times this summer about Ukraine. \u201cHe seemed to be in charge. It just seemed like he was more decisive,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nGiuliani acknowledges seeking a statement in which the Ukrainians would have publicly committed to investigating Burisma, but he says Volker and Sondland drafted it, not him.\n\nSondland, while acknowledging a close relationship with Trump, viewed Volker as more of a presence on the Ukraine issue. \u201cThe fact that he had some relationship with Trump did not put him in the vanguard of dealing with Rudy, that was Volker,\u201d the person said.\n\nFrom May to August, Giuliani\u2019s requests for investigations seemed odd but not overly concerning to Sondland, the person said.\n\n\u201cThe statement that Rudy was demanding was a quid pro quo for a White House visit, there was no doubt about that. But it was about corruption, which from their perspective wasn\u2019t particularly problematic, it\u2019s an issue the U.S. had been dealing with there for years.\u201d\n\nBy Sept. 9, Sondland, however, had grown increasingly concerned, as military funding for Ukraine now appeared tied to the statement as well. The person said Sondland was never briefed about Biden being part of the issue and was not aware of it until the transcript of the phone call was released. \u201cIf he had known earlier, he never would have touched this.\u201d\n\nSome analysts have expressed skepticism that Sondland, who spoke frequently with the president, would not have been read in on why Burisma was of interest to him.\n\nSondland \u201csomehow wants all of us to believe that he is \u2018shocked, shocked\u2019 that anything he was wrapped up in was aimed at the Bidens. That beggars belief,\u201d said Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cAfter all, he is a political appointee who prided himself on having direct access to Trump during this period.\u201d\n\nJosh Dawsey, Greg Miller and Greg Jaffe contributed to this report.", "description": "The U.S. ambassador to the European Union is expected to say he doesn\u2019t know whether the president was being truthful.", "authors": ["Aaron C.
