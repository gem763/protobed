That was Djokovic\u2019s first competitive match since retiring during his fourth-round clash with Stan Wawrinka at the U.S. Open.\n\nJapanese wild card Taro Daniel caused the biggest upset of the day by beating second-seeded Borna Coric 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (5) after a grueling 2 hours, 39 minutes in 30-degree C (86 F) heat on the Colosseum show court.\n\nDaniel is joined in the second round by compatriot Yasutaka Uchiyama, the qualifier needing only 54 minutes to dismantle fourth-seeded Benoit Paire 6-2, 6-2. He next meets Radu Albot, who beat Krajinovic 6-3, 7-5.\n\nUchiyama\u2019s victory means four of the five Japanese main draw entries made it through to the second round.\n\nReilly Opelka won an all-American duel with seventh-seeded Taylor Fritz, 6-3, 6-4, to set up a second-round match against Frenchman Gilles Simon, who beat Pablo Andujar 6-4, 6-0.\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Novak Djokovic made amends for his doubles exit at the Japan Open by progressing to the second round of the singles on Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Hulmes"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
