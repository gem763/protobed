Korean exports have dipped for 10 consecutive months since December amid a prolonged trade dispute between the United States and China, the world\u2019s largest importers of South Korean goods.\u201cConsidering the country\u2019s close financial and trade relations with the countries, a change in China\u2019s relationship with Taiwan and Hong Kong may have direct and indirect impacts on the Korean economy,\u201d the Bank of Korea (BOK) said in a weekly report.China is by far the world\u2019s largest importer of Korean products, while Hong Kong and Taiwan make up the world\u2019s fourth- and sixth-largest destinations of Korean exports.\u201cIn addition, of all our exports to Hong Kong, 82.6 percent are re-exported to China,\u201d the report said.The report noted Taiwan\u2019s exports and investment to China may already be waning, possibly contributing to a slowdown in China\u2019s growth.\u201cThe slumping trade with Taiwan and reshoring of Taiwanese companies from China are also negatively impacting the Chinese economy that is already slowing down,\u201d it said.\u201cDeterioration in China-Taiwan and China-Hong Kong relations will act as a factor that will increase uncertainties in their shared region, as well as the global market,\u201d the report added.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
