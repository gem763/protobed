It will be his 21st cap in six years.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve just turned 25 and had four shoulder operations, dislocated elbows, ankles, and yet I still have a few caps,\u2019 said Amos. \u2018Hopefully, I\u2019ll have a good run now.\u2019\n\nHallam Amos' stop-start Wales career resumes on Sunday against Uruguay at the World Cup\n\nAmos is meant to be the one holding the scalpel, not the patient on the operating table.\n\nAfter graduating from Cardiff University with a neuroscience degree this summer, he is targeting becoming a surgeon when his rugby career stops.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m lucky in that I can take a step back away from the rugby and focus on my studies,\u2019 the wing said.\n\n\u2018I have my bachelor of science degree and three years left of medicine to do.\u2019\n\nWales head coach Warren Gatland has made 13 changes for the final World Cup pool match\n\n\u2018Six years down, three to go, and that will be my medical degree then done in three years time when I\u2019ll have a decision to make, whether to do what Jamie Roberts has done and carry on with the rugby, or go into being a junior doctor.\u2019\n\nSeveral shoulder dislocations have seen Amos fall down the pecking order with Wales but he is at a second World Cup now.\n\nOn Sunday, he is playing for a chance to force his way into starting contention for the big games and is confident those injury woes are behind him.\n\nHis versatility may be key to that ambition. Amos starts on the wing for the first time for Wales in two years \u2014 since South Africa in 2017 \u2014 having played more at full back recently and could be needed to cover fly-half.\n\nWith Dan Biggar out with concussion, Rhys Patchell plays with no established bench back-up.\n\nAmos could be used at 10 as Rhys Patchell has no established bench back-up on the bench\n\nIf Amos does play No 10 on Sunday, it will be the first time he has since at Monmouth School aged 15.\n\nHe has filled in there at training though. \u2018I\u2019ve been trying to emulate Bernard Foley for Australia and Ben Volavola for Fiji,\u2019 said Amos. \u2018It\u2019s been quite fun.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve enjoyed getting my hands on the ball. It\u2019s gone alright. It comes naturally. Hopefully Patchy is ready to play for a full 80 minutes though.\u2019\n\nAmos has been a frustrated spectator so far in Japan. \u2018We play the game to be out there,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018You experience the atmosphere in the warm-up and then you\u2019re sort of the bridesmaid, never the bride, coming off to watch the game.\n\n\u2018Because the boys have been flying, it\u2019s a great environment to be in and has been for two years now with that great winning run.\n\n\u2018You want to be on the pitch. It will be exciting to be out there.\u2019\n\nWarren Gatland wants him to take his chance as well. \u2018He\u2019s really matured in terms of his talking, communication and chat,\u2019 said the Wales coach.\n\n\u2018The message to these players is to put their hand up and stake a claim for the quarter-finals.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not just an idle comment. If someone does go out and performs outstandingly we will look at them for the following week.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Wales are confident Jonathan Davies will be fit to face France in the quarter-final.\n\nThe 31-year-old centre hurt his against Fiji. Defence coach Shaun Edwards said: \u2018We don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s as bad as we first feared.\u2019", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN KUMAMOTO: Amos is tired of life in the waiting room.
