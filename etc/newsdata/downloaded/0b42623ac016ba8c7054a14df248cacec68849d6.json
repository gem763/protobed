That\u2019s partly why the legendary Seth Godin said \u201cyou can no longer say marketing is what I do at the end. It is what you do at the beginning.\u201d\n\nThat may explain why (from my experience) many experienced founders now try to imagine the entire process that\u2019d go into their digital product evolution. They try to observe trends/behaviors and gather as much data/details as they can, before taking any serious action towards product development or promotion.\n\nAs an emerging founder, you\u2019ve probably imagined that you\u2019d need to research your target market. Size up the competition. Assemble a team. And, finally, create your product. Awesome! Now, what next?\n\nDevelop a product strategy that\u2019d minimize risk, improve viability and impress the target audience\n\nCredit: Adam Fard I\u2019ve found that many aspiring/new founders assume that they\u2019d only need to start thinking about product strategy (and launch strategy) after they\u2019ve finished developing their products. This could be counterproductive. The best time to develop your product strategy (including your product launch strategy) is before (not after) you finish developing your product.\n\nA product strategy is the evolutionary vision of the product. Whether you\u2019re building a new product from scratch or enhancing an existing one, a well-defined product strategy helps you make better product decisions, promotes consistency between teams and ensures that the product will bring real value to the market. In essence, your product strategy needs to outline what your product is, where it\u2019s going, why users need it, and how you will promote it to users. This is where the product launch strategy is usually birthed.\n\nWithout a clear product strategy in place, you risk giving the product a bunch of unnecessary features, replicating other products on the market, and/or putting stakeholders\u2019 wishes above users\u2019 needs. Basically, the lack of early product strategy may increase the odds of launching a product that\u2019s bound to fail. Fortunately, a sound product/product launch strategy is not beyond what any aspiring founder can put together.\n\nFour actionable steps to building a useful product strategy framework\n\n\u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin\n\nAs I already explained, having a product strategy in place is pivotal to the creation of a viable product that would stand the chance to remain in the market for the long term. Thus, to develop a solid product strategy framework, you need to:\n\n1) Clarify your business objectives\n\nConduct stakeholder interviews to learn more about the digital product you\u2019re creating. Find out about any conflicting views, possible constraints, and practical solutions.\n\nQuestions to ask: Why are you building this product? Who is it for? What problem(s) does it solve? How is it different from other products? How will you profit from it? What is the ultimate goal that this product is designed to fulfill?\n\n2) Get to know your competitors\n\nDiscover direct and indirect competitors who are attempting to solve the same problem. Analyzing the competitive landscape will help you understand the product differentiators and achieve unique positioning in the market.\n\nQuestions to ask: Who are your competitors? What features do they offer? How much does their product cost? What are the key differentiators? How are they promoting their product?\n\n3) Get to know the intended users\n\nUnderstand who your users are so you can shape your product to their needs. You also need to know where they are in the digital world, the common digital products they typically use, and the kind of influencers and digital tribes they generally belong to. Try to validate your assumptions by conducting user research, which should involve speaking to prospective users or users of your competitor\u2019s products (more on this later).\n\nQuestions to ask: Who are your target users? Where can you find them online? Who do they listen to? How do they behave? Which similar products (direct or indirect) do they currently use? How do they typically use those products? What problems and frustrations do they currently have? How can your product help them?\n\n4) Be sure to document your findings\n\nGather everything you\u2019ve learned about your business, competition, and users, and document it. This way, you and your team will always have something to fall back on for clarity and direction.\n\nQuestions to ask: What have you learned from the findings? How will the findings help you improve the product? Are there any unsolved constraints?\n\n*Note: The product strategy framework (at this stage) should not impose specific/final solutions. Instead, it should serve as a reference point to help teams prioritize tasks, assist in the decision-making process, and strengthen consistency among teams/units. Thing is, there\u2019s still a need to go the extra mile in user research before making concrete decisions on strategy.\n\nConduct user research to gain valuable insight into the behavior/motivations of your primary target audience\n\nCredit: Adam Fard You might think you\u2019ve got an awesome product idea. But how certain are you that people need it, and will be willing to pay for it sustainably? No matter how good a product is, it\u2019s useless if nobody wants it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t find customers for your products, find products for your customers.\u201d \u2014 Seth Godin\n\nAgain, it\u2019s vital to conduct user research early in the product development phase to determine what users want and more importantly, need from your product. This way, you can make quality decisions regarding your digital product.\n\nFour effective user research methods any aspiring founder can deploy quickly\n\nReady? Try one or a mix of the following user research methods to help you better understand your target audience:\n\n1) Create user personas\n\nUser personas are a representation of your target user group. They are a valuable research tool to help you understand how to build \u2014 and market \u2014 your product to a specific group of people. The aim of personas is to prioritize problems and solutions by predicting user behavior.\n\nA good user persona incorporates the ideal user\u2019s demographic profile, professional background, motivations, frustrations, and goals.\n\n2) Conduct user surveys\n\nUser surveys are a good way of collecting quantitative data about your users before a product is designed or released. To carry out a survey, develop a list of questions that validate or refute any of your assumptions.\n\nIf possible, reach out to existing users or find survey participants via social media and online advertising. Just remember not to get too carried away with your questions or else people will skip the survey.\n\n3) Hold user interviews\n\nIn-person interviews let you gather qualitative data about your users, their thoughts, and experiences. Since interviews are more flexible, you can delve into more detail about how users interact with your digital product and the quality of their interactions.\n\nTo get the most useful information out of interviews, avoid leading, closed, or vague questions that only elicit \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d responses. This way, you will extract more useful information from users.\n\n4) Observe people using your product\n\nAnother effective way to understand user behavior is to watch how people use your product. The goal of this research method is to observe how users navigate their way toward the successful completion of the task at hand. Therefore, this method is also ideal for testing the proficiency of your UX design.\n\nTo make the most of this user research method, ask users to perform specific tasks and encourage them to talk you through the process. For accurate results, keep any interference at an absolute minimum.\n\nAlso, again, you want to get as much information on your competitors as you can. What trends are they following, how are they promoting their products, and what features do they have? Looking at how your competitors are positioning themselves in the market is crucial to launching and positioning your own digital product. You may also use this new information to update/validate your initial product strategy framework.\n\nOnce your product strategy framework and user experience research are in place, the next thing is to design a process that would ensure that legendary user experience and enviable customer experience are a core part of your product delivery.\n\nDefine and communicate product value through an impeccable UX and CX process\n\nYou cannot launch a digital product without first laying the foundations for great user experience (UX) and customer experience (CX). Providing a seamless UX and CX will increase product value and make it easier to achieve your business goals. Therefore, you should work hard to fine-tune both your UX and CX strategy before launching your digital product.\n\nBut aren\u2019t UX and CX pretty much the same? No, they\u2019re not.\n\nUX looks at how users interact with a specific digital product and their overall experience using it. Specifically, UX deals with the design of a product\u2019s interface in terms of usability, navigation, predictability, visual hierarchy, and information architecture.\n\nOn the other hand, CX has a broader scope and looks at how users interact with all aspects of a brand \u2014 including products, customer service, sales process, advertising, brand reputation, and pricing \u2014 and how the user feels about them.\n\nNow that you know the difference between UX and CX, you probably want to improve yours as soon as possible.\n\nFive actionable keys to awesome user experience\n\nFor awesome user experience, you should pay attention to:\n\nConsistency \u2014 Ensure that customers will have the same experience across devices\n\n\u2014 Simplicity \u2014 Remove any unnecessary steps in the customer journey\n\n\u2014 Flow \u2014 Allow customers to smoothly navigate their way across touchpoints.\n\nUser control \u2014 Give users the ability to use the product independently and efficiently\n\n\u2014 Give users the ability to use the product independently and efficiently Accessibility \u2014 Make your product easily accessible to as many customers as possible.\n\nFive actionable keys to awesome customer experience\n\nFor great customer experience, you should focus on:\n\nCommunication \u2014 Simplify communication processes for easier, real-time interactions\n\n\u2014 Simplify communication processes for easier, real-time interactions Personalization \u2014 Let users personalize aspects of their experience\n\n\u2014 Let users personalize aspects of their experience Customer centricity \u2014 Put your customers first at every stage of the customer journey\n\n\u2014 Put your customers first at every stage of the customer journey Speed \u2014 Respond to customers\u2019 needs and requests as soon as possible\n\n\u2014 Proactivity \u2014 Be proactive rather than reactive when dealing with customers\n\nOnce you\u2019re done with the preliminary product/competition/user research, you\u2019d be able to formulate a clear hypothesis regarding your product\u2019s viability and the potential impact it would have on the market. Now it\u2019s time to prove/disprove that hypothesis through prototype testing.\n\nBuild a prototype of your intended product and test it\n\nCredit: Adam Fard A prototype is one of the best ways to demonstrate the value of a product to prospective users. Releasing a prototype of your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before the official launch date helps paint a clearer picture of how users can use and interact with your product.\n\nJust think about how much easier it would be to sell a product that you can actually show to users. It requires less imagination and getting a sneak-peek of the product scraps any doubts that potential users may have about buying it.\n\nDraw on your findings from your market research to build a prototype, and then conduct beta testing on real users. Beta testing lets you confirm launch date readiness, evaluate customer experience early on, and more importantly, build product awareness. By doing so, you can identify any problems and solve them accordingly.\n\nIf your earlier hypothesis is disproved, a flaw is discovered, or something is found to be wrong during the testing period, it\u2019s all good. That\u2019s the time to go back and fix the problem (hopefully) without a monumental liability. But if all goes well, then you\u2019re all set to launch. But, between the period of successful prototype test and the official launch date is a period that can be used for pre-launch activities.\n\nUse the pre-launch period to build strong anticipation for your product launch\n\nCredit: Adam Fard This stage focuses on what you need to do in the time leading up to your official digital product launch \u2014 which is usually weeks (and sometimes months) in advance.\n\nThe pre-launch stage is the perfect opportunity to stir the waters, spread the word, and prepare your audience for what\u2019s coming. If you have done a good job from the onset, you\u2019d find it easier to capture the attention of your target audience (and their influencers); and credibly spread your product\u2019s uniqueness (and value) on the right media platforms/channels.\n\nThe idea is to create a massive buzz and anticipation that builds up to the official launch date. At a bare minimum, you need to deploy a mix communication tactics strategically in order to have a successful product launch.\n\nSeven pre-launch tactics you can use to generate buzz and build anticipation for your digital product\n\nYou can have a super cool product, but without promoting it, no one will hear about it. Generating buzz is one of the most important elements of taking your product to market.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sell anything if you can\u2019t tell anything.\u201d \u2014 Beth Comstock\n\nDepending on your existing clout, budget and overall marketing strategy, below is a non-exhaustive list of some effective pre-launch tactics you can use to promote your product leading up to the big day: A strategic mix of all the entire tactics may create more buzz.\n\n1) Build landing pages\n\nCreate a landing page with key information about your product. Add a countdown timer to generate extra anticipation.\n\n2) Set up a pre-orders system\n\nSet up a separate landing page where users can pre-order your product. Offering the option to pre-order will tell you if people are actually interested in your product.\n\n3) Use email broadcasts\n\nSend out a set of email campaigns to your audience. Partners/influencers may also be engaged to do this as part of the overall strategy. Use emails to inform people about what your product is about, when it will be released, and how it will benefit them.\n\n4) Distribute press releases\n\nWrite a press release and distribute it across different news outlets. This way, you can increase your exposure and outreach.\n\n5) Publish blog series\n\nCreate shareable content about your product and related topics. This will bring traffic to your website and increase your visibility.\n\n6) Post social media updates\n\nEstablish your presence on various social media channels to create even more noise about your product and upcoming launch.\n\n7) Offer the early adapters an early bird deal\n\nOffer a discounted price for early birds interested in your product. This pricing tactic can significantly drive sales at launch. But, even after the official release, strategic pricing models can be used to either drive or control sales at post-launch phase.\n\nReview your metrics and reevaluate your methods at the post-launch phase\n\nCredit: Adam Fard After you have officially launched your product, you should focus on user evaluations and gathering feedback.\n\nHere are the questions you should ask yourself post-launch:\n\nHow many conversions did I get from my website? If the number is not what you anticipated, review your UX design to identify any obstacles in the customer journey.\n\nWhat feedback did I receive from users? Take the positive and negative feedback you receive from users and use it to refine your UX and CX.\n\nWhat can I do to increase conversions and generate new leads? Think of new ways to reach out to users, such as free trials, demos, resources, and product videos.\n\nSpeaking of conversions and leads, one tried-and-tested way to capture new leads is to use a conversion-centered design.\n\nThe seven main principles of a conversion-centered design include:\n\nEncapsulation \u2014 Use a tunnel-like effect to guide users\u2019 eyes to your CTA\n\n\u2014 Use a tunnel-like effect to guide users\u2019 eyes to your CTA Contrast \u2014 Make your CTA stand out by using a color that contrasts with the background\n\n\u2014 Make your CTA stand out by using a color that contrasts with the background Directional cues \u2014 Place arrows or pathways to direct users to your CTA\n\nWhite space \u2014 Use plenty of white space to make your CTA button easier to spot\n\n\u2014 Use plenty of white space to make your CTA button easier to spot Urgency and scarcity \u2014 Compel users to make faster purchasing decisions with triggers\n\n\u2014 Compel users to make faster purchasing decisions with triggers Try before you buy \u2014 Allow users to try your product before committing to buying\n\n\u2014 Allow users to try your product before committing to buying Social proof \u2014 Gain trust from users by displaying testimonials or ratings from other users\n\nBut don\u2019t stop here. Continue to look at your metrics and analytics to understand user behavior. The data you collect will help you tweak your product and drive even more conversions further along the road.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nLaunching a digital product is nothing short of exciting \u2014 or terrifying. This is why it\u2019s essential that you plan accordingly and execute effectively.\n\nThe future of your digital product depends on what you do now and the choices you make to improve your UX. So, make your actions count and stay ahead of the curve.", "description": "Are you working on a digitial product?
