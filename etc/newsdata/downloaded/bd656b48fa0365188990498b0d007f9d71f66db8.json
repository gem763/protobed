A Nickelodeon Universe theme park, DreamWorks water park, and ice-skating rink opened first and will be followed by various stages of opening that will last throughout 2020.\n\nAfter over 20 years of stalling, American Dream is surrounded by hype\n\n\"It does sound like it's generating a lot of interest, at least initially,\" remarked retail historian and lecturer at the University of Essex Vicki Howard, who authored the book \"From Main Street to Mall: The Rise and Fall of the American Department Store.\"\n\nAmerican Dream will house Nickelodeon Universe, which will be the largest indoor theme park in the Western Hemisphere. American Dream\n\nAmerican Dream, which has evolved considerably since its conception in 1996, has garnered much hype for its widely anticipated opening after being delayed for many years. Tickets for the opening weekend of the complex's Nickelodeon Universe theme park have already sold out.\n\n\"But I would wonder whether over the long haul it would be able to sustain the foot traffic that it would need to remain profitable,\" Howard added.\n\nBigger does not necessarily mean better\n\nTraffic in US malls has declined considerably in the last year.\n\n\"The idea that big is better is not necessarily the case today,\" said Howard about the megamall trend, explaining that whether or not American Dream will be successful in the long run still remains to be seen. \"I'm not sure that it is something that is going to take off.\"\n\nMore than 150,000 people swarmed the Mall of America when it opened in 1992. Mall of America\n\nLuckily, the owners of the massive complex, Triple Five Group, have a reliable track record with super malls. The group also owns Mall of America and West Edmonton Mall, the two largest retail and entertainment centers in North America.\n\nMore than 42 million people from all over the world come to visit Mall of America every year. The complex generates nearly $2 billion in economic activity for Minnesota annually, according to press materials for the shopping center.\n\nMegamalls are not dependent on department store anchors\n\nAn advantage that large complexes like American Dream possess is their independence from traditional department store anchors. \"The department store industry has suffered in recent decades,\" Howard said. \"And their path is closely connected to that of the shopping mall.\"\n\nWhen department store like Sears and JCPenney close, that creates an empty hole in a traditional mall, which can sometimes lead the the shuttering of the entire complex.\n\n\"This is a different kind of complex not dependent on department store anchors,\" Howard said of the megamall, explaining that other attractions and amenities will likely be the drivers of foot traffic in these centers.\n\n'American Dream' is a term with cultural resonance\n\nThe name chosen for the megamall is an interesting choice, Howard said. The mall was initially named Xanadu but was re-dubbed American Dream in 2011 when the Triple Five Group took over the project.\n\n\"It's a complicated word that has a lot of cultural resonance and has been debated over time,\" Howard said of the term \"American Dream,\" which she teaches in her US history class. As a center of American consumerism and entertainment, American Dream seems like it will be worthy of its name.\n\n\"For over 35 years, Triple Five Group has embraced the concept that retail cannot exist without entertainment and experiential elements, and American Dream will further raise the bar,\" said President of American Dream Don Ghermezian in a press release. \"Guests will experience something completely unique each time they visit \u2014 this project will be the realization of their wildest dreams.\"\n\nFor this 3 million-square-foot center, the success of this dream still has yet to be determined.\n\n\"It's an ideal,\" Howard said of the term that has come to represent consumerism and consumption. \"It's something that's promised, but it's not something that is enjoyed by everybody.\"", "description": "More than 8,600 store are expected to close in 2019 as the\u00a0retail apocalypse ravages the US.
