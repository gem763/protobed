Throw in a couple of practical problems \u2014 the Nats suddenly can\u2019t hit, and no team has ever had four road wins in the World Series \u2014 and what lies ahead in Houston seems unsolvable.\n\nLast I checked, though, they\u2019re going to play Game 6 with the possibility of one more beyond that. The Nationals, dominated for three games at home and trailing 3-2 in the series, have a road forward. Might as well lean on the words of their manager in the moments after they won the pennant \u2014 \u201cBumpy roads lead to beautiful places,\u201d Dave Martinez said that night \u2014 and try to figure out how this now very, very unlikely championship could be won.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve done a tremendous job to get ourselves out of those holes,\u201d right fielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re kind of a battle-tested ship, so to speak. We\u2019ve had a lot of battles and been through some really tough storms, but I think we\u2019re stronger for it. We\u2019re looking at this no different.\u201d\n\nHow, then, should the Nats look at this particular storm?\n\nStart with the offense, which must be located. Maybe it\u2019s still on a hanger in a hotel closet in Houston. If so, pray the Nats get the same rooms.\n\nIn the three games at Nationals Park, during which they were outscored 19-3, Washington hitters produced a slash line (batting average/on-base percentage/slugging percentage) of .175/.266/.258. That output over three games in July is a slump. That output over three games in October puts the season in peril.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people get caught up with one game, one at-bat, one situation,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you play seven games.\u201d\n\nOr, in this case, hope to play seven games. Turner may not want to get caught up in one game or one at-bat, so let\u2019s not do that. Over the five games of the series to this point, he is 3 for 22 (.136) and has gone 10 games without an extra-base hit. That\u2019s a limiting aspect of the Nationals\u2019 offense, and it\u2019s among the things that have to change. Anthony Rendon (4 for 20), Howie Kendrick (4 for 18), Ryan Zimmerman (4 for 18) \u2014 any or all could consider getting hot at about, say, 8:07 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s nothing we can just sit down and talk about and it happens,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cIt\u2019s more one hit falls and all of a sudden it\u2019s kind of a snowball effect. The more you think about it, the more you talk about it, the worse it gets.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFine. Let\u2019s not talk about it \u2014 other than to say future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander might be just the person against whom to get well. The Nats tagged Verlander for four runs in six-plus innings in what became a blowout win in Game 2 that could be a blueprint for what needs to happen going forward. The three games in Washington, the Nationals were tied with the Astros after two innings \u2014 and trailed after the other 25.\n\nSo here\u2019s an idea: Get a lead. They did on Verlander, scoring twice in the first \u2014 which Stephen Strasburg gave back on Alex Bregman\u2019s homer in the bottom of the inning. But after Kurt Suzuki opened the seventh with a solo shot, the Nats were in the process of exposing what they need to expose: the Astros\u2019 bullpen. No, it\u2019s not as shaky (read: hazardous to your health) as Washington\u2019s. But chasing Verlander \u2014 who brings to the mound a 0-5 record and 5.73 ERA in his career in the World Series \u2014 would get them to the pitchers against whom they might break their collective slumps Tuesday at Minute Maid Park.\n\nAbout that venue: It says here that it\u2019s an advantage for the Nationals to play in Houston. Not an advantage over the Astros. But an advantage over their other selves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite the events of the weekend, the atmosphere at Nationals Park was downright buoyant. This October has rid the joint of those moments when 43,000 people seemed to believe that whatever happened next would be bad.\n\nStill, in a sport in which postseason home-field advantage essentially boils down to having the last at-bat and nothing more, I believe it can be freeing to play on the road. There\u2019s more power in quieting an opposing crowd than firing up your own folks. Given that the Astros and their fans clearly believe \u2014 with reason \u2014 that they should now win the series, imagine the confidence that would come from silencing that throng, from delaying a trophy presentation by a night.\n\nAll of this is a recipe to win Game 6, which is the only way to get to Game 7. Who knows what would happen then? Max Scherzer, his stiff neck healed by an acupuncturist, a masseuse and a convent of nuns, could come out of the bullpen. Heck, he could start. Either way, what a scene.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd this whole win-every-game-on-the-road thing? No, that hasn\u2019t happened. But there\u2019s no fear in facing the task. The past seven World Series games have been won by the road team. The past five World Series champs have been crowned away from home. Among them: the 2016 Chicago Cubs, who went to Cleveland trailing three games to two, beat the Indians twice in their own yard and broke a \u00ad108-year drought.\n\nThe bench coach on that team: Dave Martinez. There was a sense with those Cubs that getting out of Chicago, out of the cauldron, would make them looser. Oddly, distance provided comfort. Martinez said the temperature of his Washington players late Sunday night was similar.\n\n\u201cThey were all upbeat,\u201d Martinez said Monday.\n\nAD\n\nBeing upbeat doesn\u2019t win ballgames or stave off elimination. But that attitude colors the time and the place the Nats are in now. Tuesday night in Houston is merely the 178th time these Nationals will have the opportunity to go 1-0. That\u2019s the path to Wednesday, to Game 7, when anything could happen.\n\nAD\n\nRoll over because the Astros have shown they\u2019re better? Nope.\n\n\u201cWe deserve the moment we\u2019re in \u2014 a chance to win the World Series,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cI think the \u2018want\u2019 is real. We\u2019re not, like, happy to be here and we\u2019ll see where the cards fall. We want to win this thing.\u201d\n\nFor all the Astros\u2019 excellence, there is still that chance. The road back to Houston was bumpy. But it still could be a beautiful place.\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington\u2019s only shot to win two more games on the road starts with getting a lead in the first one.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g784WkKbGn75yQgz2pQbTzOE6Lk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SVPHHXXZU4I6TAMQNPSN5NLOAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
