The White House issued a veto threat against the bill in February.\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have called on Trump repeatedly to bring up the House-passed universal background checks bill. Over the weekend, Pelosi and Schumer issued a statement following a phone call with Trump that anything other than the House-passed bill \u201cwill not get the job done.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSchumer reiterated his calls Monday for the White House to back the House proposal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly willing to discuss the finer points of legislation with our Republican colleagues, but we made one thing clear to the president -- the effectiveness of gun safety measures will be severely compromised if we allow the loopholes in our background check system to remain intact,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\nBut Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said Monday that Schumer and Pelosi were merely trying to score political points.\n\n\u201cThe things that they are proposing just aren\u2019t realistic and they know that and so it\u2019s designed more to talk to their political base and it\u2019s a lot more about that than I think an actual solution,\u201d Thune said.\n\nTrump met again with aides Monday to discuss proposals to address gun violence. The White House expects to release the package of proposal this week but Trump is on a campaign trip to New Mexico and California though Wednesday night. On Friday, he will host an all-day state visit for officials from Australia. His schedule makes Thursday the most likely day, though nothing has been scheduled.\n\nWhile Trump will not support the House-passed universal background checks bill, he could still back a more limited form of background check legislation as well as so-called red flag laws. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who is working on a red flag bill with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that both background checks and red flag bills should go hand in hand.\n\n\u201cThe two go together \u2014 the goal is to achieve both,\u201d Blumenthal said. Both are designed to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal added that the White House \u201cis divided and probably the president is divided in his own mind.\u201d\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who along with Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), is working on a potential background check proposal with the White House, said Monday that he remains optimistic about the president.\n\n\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t going to do anything he would have called,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t called me yet. So I still have hope. I really do. He was very engaged.\u201d\n\nAnita Kumar contributed to this report.", "description": "The president's position doesn't come as a surprise.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/44/39/9f430d5a4d0b99f907fa6c094bbe/190916-trump-lawn-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
