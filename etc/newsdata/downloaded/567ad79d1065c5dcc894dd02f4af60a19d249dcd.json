Some 3287 men and women went through cognitive tests and 716 had brain scans. The participants were all young adults, age 23 to 35, in 1990.\n\nIncome volatility was defined as at least one instance of an income drop of more than 25%. \u201cHigher income volatility was associated with worse performance on [brain] processing speed and executive functioning,\u201d they found. Alarmingly, the results showed up as physical deterioration in the brain. \u201cHigher income volatility and more income drops were also associated with worse microstructural integrity of total brain and total white matter,\u201d they added.\n\nThe main caveat is that brain scans and cognitive tests were not conducted at the start of the study, in 1990. Leslie Grasset, a professor of Epidemiology at the University of Bordeaux and the lead author of the study, concedes that it is possible slower thinkers ended up suffering more income volatility, rather than the other way around. However, she says, the results held up even when using starting education levels as a proxy for initial brain power.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: One simple way to reduce high blood pressure \u2014 along with the risk of heart attacks, cardiovascular disease and strokes\n\nIn the second study, researchers followed a cohort of nearly 9,000 people. Their incomes were compared between a first time period, 1987-1989, and a second, 1993-1995. That corresponded to the boom of the late 1980s and the slump that followed. Their health was studied up to 2016.\n\nThe result: Those who had suffered an income drop of 50% or more between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s were much more likely to suffer heart problems over the next two decades. That included strokes, fatal heart attacks and myocardial infarction.\n\nThose who had suffered an income drop of 50% or more between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s were much more likely to suffer heart problems.\n\nThose who suffered big gains in income were less likely to suffer heart problems.\n\nThese are not the first studies suggesting a connection between economic volatility and poor health. Severe or prolonged periods of stress, including economic shocks and worry, have clear immediate effects. However, the latest results show that some of the damage may be permanent.\n\nThis is a public-health problem, the researchers argue. Recent decades have seen increasing numbers of economic downturns and shocks in the U.S. and other advanced western economies, economists note. The early 1990s and the early 2000s both saw painful recessions followed by sluggish jobs markets that lasted for a few years.\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2007-2008 produced the deepest recession since the 1930s, and a jobs market that took nearly a decade to recover. These have marked the young adulthood of Generation X \u2014 those born between 1965 and 1980 \u2014 and millennials \u2014 those born from 1981 to around 1996.\n\nGlobal competition and the emergence of technology have been widely blamed for the turmoil, even while they have also driven overall long-term growth. Many commentators worry that the rise of \u201cmachine learning\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d could usher in a new wave of disruption, and computers take over yet more jobs.", "description": "Two new studies show lasting effects of a decline in financial status.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS881_arends_ZG_20191008131151.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
