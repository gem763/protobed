Today looks like another good day. People told us ke scam mara nex [People told us it\u2019s a scam, but it isn\u2019t]. Let\u2019s plug you.\u201d\n\nAlthough some people have reaped the benefits of the WhatsApp stokvel, others have not been so lucky.\n\n\u201cI joined the #WhatsAppStokvel, I paid R200 and I was blocked,\u201d another user said.\n\nBut how does it work? Many have claimed it\u2019s easy as pie to join and reap the rewards. You join a WhatsApp group, pay R200 and your name gets added to a list.\n\nYou then recruit as many people as you can and climb to the top of the list as more people join.\n\nAn amount of R1 200 is later deposited into the account of the person who\u2019s at the top of the list and participants are then encouraged to rejoin.\n\nMother-of-three, Portia Mollo from Gauteng, can\u2019t stop praising it.\n\n\u201cI joined the R150 stokvel and I\u2019ve already received my R750 pay-out,\u201d she tells us.\n\nShe believes in it so much that she\u2019s already recruited seven people.\n\n\u201cYou pay the person who\u2019s number one on the list and that money goes into that person\u2019s account directly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce that person is paid, that person is \u2018kicked out\u2019 and goes to the bottom of the list,\u201d she explains.\n\nThe earnings are R750 and the person keeps the R600 and then reinvests the R150.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re recycling your money,\u201d she added.\n\nThe reason they encourage people to rejoin is that it shows that you\u2019re loyal. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take people\u2019s money and leave,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cYou need to work for your money and so that people can move up and also get your chance.\u201d\n\nPortia says a friend of hers has already been paid three times within four days.\n\n\u201cWhen the number gets to about 21, we split members into three groups so that everyone gets a chance to be number one, it makes the process quicker.\u201d\n\nExperts have warned that this stokvel has elements of a pyramid scheme but Portia disagrees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about losing the money, it\u2019s just R150. I joined with an open mind that I might lose my money because it\u2019s like gambling,\u201d Portia says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care whether you call it a pyramid scheme or a square, it\u2019s R150 and I\u2019m now R600 richer.\n\n\u201cYes, people can be bad,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut the trick is to join the right group. There are people who have joined the R1 000 stokvel.\u201d\n\nFinancial advisor Warren Ingram says, according to lexico.com, a pyramid scheme is defined as, \u201ca form of investment (illegal in the UK and elsewhere) in which each paying participant recruits two further participants, with returns being given to early participants using money contributed by later ones\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the WhatsApp stokvel is what happens when people who get paid out decide not to rejoin again? It would mean that people who paid last might lose all their money and that\u2019s what happens in a pyramid scheme,\u201d Warren says.\n\nAnd while the intentions of this stokvel might be good, the dangers are the same as any pyramid scheme, Warren tells YOU.\n\nHe says great stokvels work well because the members know each other and hold one another responsible.\n\n\u201cBad stokvels are those where members don\u2019t know each other and therefore don\u2019t feel responsible for each other.\n\n\u201cPersonally I\u2019d avoid this WhatsApp stokvel and rather start my own one with family and friends who I know and trust,\u201d he says.\n\nInvestor and trader Simon Brown says if your profit is dependent on recruiting more people who must pay in, then this isn\u2019t an investment, it\u2019s a pyramid scheme.\n\n\u201cA real investment requires no recruiting and no pay-in from others in order to succeed.\u201d\n\nHe says the long-term average returns from the stock market are around 12% a year with some bank accounts also offering about the same or a little less.\n\nAnything offering more than that level of return has to be viewed as either extremely high risk or a scam, Simon explains.\n\n\u201cA six-fold return on your R200 in a matter of hours or days is not an investment, it\u2019s a scam. And while it can run for a while and early adopters will make money, they\u2019re doing so from a scam and eventually, it has to end in tears as one runs out of new recruits to bring more money into the scam,\u201d he says.\n\nBut some stokvel members like Portia aren\u2019t fazed.\n\n\u201cWhen Old Mutual and all these financial institutions started, nobody said it was a scam,\u201d Portia tells YOU, adding that she\u2019s still a member of the stokvel.", "description": "While the intentions of this stokvel might be good, the dangers are the same as any pyramid scheme.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9460/68e1d9ab3993450b9d3880ca49a378dd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
