Turnout in the 2015 election tallied at 50.92 percent.\n\n\u2013 Teflon party \u2013\n\nKaczynski has capitalised on a populist backlash against liberal urban elites, similar to trends in Western Europe and the US.\n\nHis party\u2019s bid to build a welfare state is addressed to Poles who reaped little benefit from the explosive growth and unfettered free-market drive after communism fell.\n\nAnalysts suggest that generous social outlays have also made the PiS a \u201cteflon party\u201d, cushioning its reputation amid a string of high-profile graft scandals involving senior members.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve (PiS) removed everyone who got mixed up in scandals\u2026 so they\u2019re credible,\u201d Janina, a 74-year-old Warsaw pensioner who declined to provide her surname, told AFP.\n\n\u201cMy grandchildren get the 500+ (116 euro, $130 monthly) payment, I\u2019m getting a higher pension,\u201d she said, confirming the PiS has her vote.\n\nOthers insist the social measures come at too high a price.\n\n\u201cThe PiS gets votes by scaring people and then offering protection; in the 2015 election, migrants were the enemy, now it\u2019s gay people, it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d said Monika, a 38-year-old Warsaw mother of two working in the automotive sector.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Protect Poland\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe KO chose Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska, the even-tempered 62-year-old deputy parliamentary speaker, as its candidate for premier in a bid to counter the PiS\u2019s polarising politics.\n\n\u201cChairman Kaczynski divides people\u2026 let\u2019s protect Poland against such division, against such hatred,\u201d she told supporters this week.\n\nThe KO has vowed to reverse PiS court reforms, which the EU says threaten judicial independence and the rule of law, but has otherwise offered voters little.\n\nExperts warn that a strong PiS win will allow it to push through more judicial reforms likely to stoke conflict with the EU over the rule of law.\n\n\u2013 Most migrants \u2013\n\nCritics attribute strong economic growth under the PiS to favourable external factors.\n\nJoblessness in the country of 38 million people has hit a record low of some five percent in a tight labour market.\n\nAlthough the PiS rejected the EU\u2019s migrant quotas, Poland became the world\u2019s top temporary labour destination in 2017, according to the OECD.\n\nAround 1.2 million temporary workers, mostly Ukrainians, plugged a gap left by Poles who sought more lucrative jobs in the West after joining the EU in 2004.\n\nVoting runs from 0500 to 1900 GMT on Sunday, with exit polls expected after balloting ends. Preliminary results are due on Monday.", "description": "Warsaw (AFP) \u2013 Poles vote Sunday in a polarising election which the governing populists are set to win on the back of popular welfare measures and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/f875ec_poland-governing-populists-are-set-win-on-popular-welfare-measures-attacks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
