Maurizio Sarri would have left regardless but a more high-profile manager than Lampard would likely have been appointed.\n\nWhether someone like Max Allegri would have wanted to keep a player who symbolised more than anyone else Chelsea\u2019s \u2018Sarriball\u2019 style in 2018-19 is open to debate. New managers often assert their authority by ostracising or offloading influential players from the previous regime. Lampard, though, didn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were murmurings that Sarri wanted to whisk the centrepiece of his Napoli and Chelsea teams off to Turin, but those rumours didn\u2019t appear to have much substance. Having been booed by Chelsea fans in February, Jorginho elected to stay put to prove them wrong this season. So far, so good.\n\nFirst impressions\n\nFrank Lampard was impressed with Jorginho\u2019s dedication in training during Chelsea\u2019s pre-season (Picture: Getty)\n\nLampard had plenty on his plate during a chaotic first year in management with Derby County but given his 13-year association with Chelsea as a player, he will undoubtedly have kept a keen eye on their performances under Sarri.\n\nPerhaps Lampard had his own preconceptions of Jorginho based upon what he had seen and heard from afar, but it didn\u2019t take long to convince him that the 27-year-old was one of the few Sarri favourites worth keeping around as part of a new-look Chelsea.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a voice. He runs, he pushes people around him, he drags people up when he doesn\u2019t feel they\u2019re working as much as he might want,\u2019 Lampard said in July. \u2018I\u2019ve loved seeing that. So in terms of first impressions, working with him for 10 days, I can\u2019t ask for any more. I\u2019m delighted to have him.\u2019\n\nThose positive early impressions have clearly stuck. Only three players \u2013 goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, Cesar Azpilicueta and Mason Mount \u2013 have played more Premier League minutes for Chelsea this season than Jorginho, who along with that trio has started every game so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of whether Lampard has played a 4-3-3, 3-4-2-1 or 4-2-3-1 formation, Jorginho has started in central midfield every time. Just as with Sarri last season, Jorginho is one of the first names on the teamsheet but his role has been tweaked under Lampard.\n\nGreater freedom\n\nFrank Lampard has encouraged Jorginho to play with greater freedom at Chelsea this season (Picture: Getty)\n\nChelsea under Sarri were a team renowned for their possession-orientated style, having on average 60 per cent of the ball in the Premier League last season \u2013 a total only bettered by Manchester City who had 64 per cent. Jorginho was fundamental to that, attempting more passes than any other player in the division.\n\nA frequent criticism of Sarri and by association Jorginho was that Chelsea were passing for passing sake. Too often there wasn\u2019t enough penetration and Lampard has attempted to rectify that by quickening up Chelsea\u2019s build-up play and encouraging his midfielders to look forward earlier.\n\nAlthough Chelsea still averages more possession than their opponents, their focus has switched from attempting to drag opponents out of position through patient ball retention to looking to counter on them quickly by sending passes forward with greater urgency.\n\nAfter seven games, Chelsea\u2019s possession rate has dropped to 54 per cent, lower than six other clubs in the Premier League. Jorginho\u2019s passes per game rate also demonstrates the shift in style, as he has gone from attempting 84.3 passes per game to 66.9 this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite playing just under 20 fewer passes on average, though, Jorginho\u2019s percentage success rate is down to 85 per cent from 89 per cent last season which coupled with his average number of key passes increasing from 0.8 to 1.3 each match, highlights his more expansive role in the side.\n\nJorginho already has one league assist to his name in 2019-20 compared to none in 2018-19 and last month he admitted that Lampard has given him more \u2018freedom\u2019 in his play by asking him to play higher up the pitch.\n\nHe expanded on that ahead of the game against Lille on Wednesday, saying: \u2018He [Lampard] wants more forward play, not too much short passing, so I am trying to do that. This season we are playing with more long balls, more runs, less short passing.\u2019\n\nCoping without Kante\n\nN\u2019Golo Kante returned alongside Jorginho during Wednesday\u2019s match against Lille (Picture: Getty)\n\nAlthough Jorginho has provided greater attacking impetus from midfield, he has also had to get through a lot of defensive work too, due largely to the injury-enforced absence of N\u2019Golo Kante for much of the season.\n\nKante\u2019s superhuman levels of endurance have been discussed at length during his four and a bit years in English football but having played virtually without rest for club and country since 2016, even he has shown signs of wear and tear recently.\n\nThe Frenchman has missed seven games in the Premier League or Champions League since May, as many as he had missed through injury during his first two seasons with Chelsea. Without Kante nor a natural replacement, Jorginho has had to help plug the gap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJorginho has made the most tackles (18), interceptions (16) and recoveries (62) in Chelsea\u2019s squad during their opening Premier League fixtures. He has also out-performed Liverpool and Manchester City\u2019s midfield screeners Fabinho and Rodri in each of those metrics too.\n\nOpta definition of 'Recovery' This is where a player recovers the ball in a situation where neither team has possession or where the ball has been played directly to him by an opponent, thus securing possession for their team.\n\nThose stats, allied to Jorginho\u2019s impressive passing numbers and improved influence in the final third, paint a picture of an all-action man in the middle for Chelsea. His contribution has been vital and with Kante coming through unscathed against Lille on Wednesday, they can provide an exceptionally stable base from which Mount, Abraham and Willian can benefit.\n\nChanging perceptions\n\nJorginho has got Chelsea fans back onside with his performances at the start of the season (Picture: Getty)\n\nFrom being booed in February to being sung about in September. Jorginho\u2019s redemption arc was completed when Chelsea supporters chanted his name during the 3-2 victory over Norwich City at Carrow Road in August.\n\nLampard admitted he was \u2018delighted\u2019 with the reaction of the fans, saying: \u2018He\u2019s just a fantastic sportsman who cares deeply. When you have a training session that might fall below standard or drop for a moment, he\u2019s the one who drives it up again.\n\n\u2018When the fans see that on the pitch, as they did at Norwich, that\u2019s why they sing his name. I\u2019m delighted with that.\u2019\n\nFrom Sarri\u2019s star pupil to the leader of Lampard\u2019s revolution, Jorginho has capitalised on Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban by reinventing himself at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt has been the year of the academy stars at Stamford Bridge but Jorginho is the ticking heartbeat of this exciting new team.", "description": "In a parallel universe, Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori are all on loan somewhere, Frank Lampard is still a Championship manager and an expensively assembled Chelsea squad are...", "authors": ["Oliver Young-Myles"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173220816_1570298933.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
