Using scraps of paper and a hat, one patron picked the day, one picked the month, and their waitress picked the year. Their choices would determine Weingarten and Shroder\u2019s research, but little did they know that they\u2019d be locked into the date \u2013 Sunday 28 December 1986 \u2013 for the next six years.\n\n'Oh man, she's back': Elizabeth Strout on the return of Olive Kitteridge Read more\n\nThe conceit of One Day, the resulting book by Weingarten, out this week, is both straightforward and unspooling: what stories can be found in an \u201cordinary\u201d day in America? And is there even such a thing as an ordinary day in life? For Weingarten, a two-time Pulitzer prize winner for feature writing, the date-from-a-hat gimmick \u2013 mining a random, seemingly ordinary day for its complexities, tracing its refractions into the present \u2013 tested a central conceit in his career as a journalist: \u201cIf you have the patience to find it and the skill to tell it, there\u2019s a story behind everyone and everything,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat although great matters make for strong narratives, power can also lurk in the latent and mundane.\u201d\n\nHumble yet profound, One Day is \u201cthe culmination of too many years of work\u201d, Weingarten, 68, joked to the Guardian \u2013 the project ballooned four years past its deadline as Weingarten re-reported stories, chased leads, dead-ended and restarted, and conducted over 500 interviews. A report of a deadly house fire in Nebraska on The Day led to its embers in 2010s Colorado; a well-reported and remarkably successful heart transplant in Virginia held a grisly secret from the day before. Several stories Weingarten re-reported from that date didn\u2019t hold enough water to make the book. \u201cThere\u2019s a term that \u2018journalism is the first rough draft of history\u2019,\u201d said Weingarten, a self-described \u201cold-time\u201d journalist. \u201cI would really emphasize \u2018rough\u2019.\u201d\n\nYet the ones that did work attest that 28 December 1986 was many things \u2013 a beginning, an end, a prominent pin on the timeline of someone\u2019s life, a recently unearthed memory \u2013 but not ordinary. One Day chronicles how 28 December 1986 marks the first day of a rollercoaster marriage, a character-defining journal entry from famed mommy blogger Heather Armstrong, a police murder on a desolate highway in southern California, and a transcendent performance by the recently un-comatose Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia, among other stories.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gene Weingarten, Washington Post columnist and author of One Day.

But on the other hand, I think any day would\u2019ve been lucky.\u201d\n\nBack in 2013, Weingarten cast doubt aside and started his research, naturally, on Google. A surface-level search revealed that prolific crime novelist John D MacDonald died that day \u2013 an author who, as luck would have it, knew Shroder in his youth. What did it mean that a renowned author who died on The Day knew one of the selectors of that day? \u201cNothing but coincidence, obviously,\u201d Weingarten writes in the book, \u201cexcept in the way it speaks to degrees of separation, and our common suspicion that the deeper you drill into anything, the more eerily intertwined things become.\u201d\n\nThat was often, though not always, his experience as Weingarten dug deeper into research, from legal databases (for lawsuits filed on The Day) to newspaper archives to crowdsourcing for stories on Sirius radio shows to, eventually and often, interviews. Weingarten said it was occasionally a hard sell to have someone turn back their memory three decades, though personally, the selection of the year worked in his favor. He was 36 in 1986, \u201calready a fully formed person\u201d, with a pre-existing perspective on that time in the Reagan era. Yet even though he knew the year, the research process demanded that he look at 1986 \u201cat a depth that stunned me\u201d.\n\nStunned, as in \u201cI was going through my life and I didn\u2019t realize that on that particular day, which didn\u2019t mean much to me at the time, lives were changed, altered, destroyed, made better, love was happening, and hate was happening.\u201d\n\nThat \u201ceye-opening\u201d revelation dovetailed with an experience-tested conviction, one that happens to also be his advice to young journalists: \u201cTruth is always the best story. It just always is.\u201d Over the course of his over four decades in journalism, Weingarten said, he\u2019s learned that \u201cyou just have to allow yourself to discover a truth that you didn\u2019t expect\u201d. With the book, \u201ctime and again, I expected each of these stories to be a different kind of story, and it wound up being so much better because it was real. It\u2019s what really happened.\u201d", "description": "The two-time Pulitzer-winner picked a date out of a hat, and his book, One Day, chronicles the incredible events of that day", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfbe46f00d8cc42efe3ac29e77e450fa6562f50d/101_902_1631_978/master/1631.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49aba3cdfcba885f77d200e7145ff5ce", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
