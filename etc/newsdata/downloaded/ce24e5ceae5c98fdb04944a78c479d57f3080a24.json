He said the persisting hostility means \u201cthere can be the exchange of fire at any moment.\u201d\n\nKim Yong Chol said the Trump administration would be \u201cseriously mistaken\u201d if it ignores an end-of-year deadline set by Kim Jong Un to propose mutually acceptable terms for a deal to salvage nuclear negotiations.\n\nThe North issued a similar statement on Thursday that was attributed to veteran diplomat Kim Kye Gwan. He criticized U.S. officials for maintaining \u201cCold War mentality and ideological prejudice\u201d and urged the United States to act \u201cwisely\u201d through the end of the year.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
