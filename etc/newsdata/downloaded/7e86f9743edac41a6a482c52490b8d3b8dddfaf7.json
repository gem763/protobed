CURLF, +0.00%, with $700,000; the National Cannabis Roundtable, with $445,000; the National Cannabis Industry Association, with $430,000; and Parallel Brands Inc., with $420,000. That\u2019s according to an OpenSecrets.org analysis of lobbying disclosures filed through last week.\n\nTo be sure, the sums involved fall short of lobbying spending by bigger Washington players. Facebook Inc. FB, +0.80% alone, for example, has shelled out $12.3 million in the year to date trying to influence Washington.\n\nBut the growing outlays underscore how the banking bill, known as the SAFE Banking Act, is important to the cannabis industry. Among the top five spenders, their 2019 disclosures largely show they\u2019ve lobbied the most on that particular bill, which would provide protections to banks and credit unions that serve cannabis companies.\n\nFor now, financial institutions face legal problems because marijuana remains illegal on the federal level, even as more states legalize it. Lobbyists have emphasized that many cannabis businesses end up \u201cunbanked\u201d and operating largely in cash, and that makes them targets for robberies and other crimes.\n\nRelated: Republicans and Democrats agree that U.S. marijuana laws are a mess\n\nAnd see: Cannabis Watch \u2014 All of MarketWatch\u2019s coverage of cannabis companies\n\nLast month, the Democratic-controlled House voted to pass the SAFE Banking Act, but some analysts have warned that the measure isn\u2019t likely to become law in 2019 as it faces a tough road in the Republican-controlled Senate. While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell discussed potential banking reform with cannabis industry players in Southern California this month, analysts haven\u2019t necessarily turned optimistic on the bill\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t show yet that McConnell is willing to allow a bill to get through. I still think it\u2019s unlikely this year,\u201d said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, in a recent email to MarketWatch.\n\nPot stocks, as tracked by the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, -1.61% , have lost 19% in 2019, while the broad S&P 500 index SPX, +0.56% has gained 21%.\n\nRelated: \u2018Don\u2019t smoke the Kool-Aid,\u2019 analyst says in sober note on the cannabis sector\n\nAlso read: Cannabis producer Hexo shutting down facilities amid deep staff cuts", "description": "The cannabis industry has set a fresh record in its annual spending on lobbying Washington, with its outlay of $3.77 million through this year\u2019s third...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU166_cannab_ZG_20191028160811.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
