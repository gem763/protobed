It could only happen in prog-rock. But it didn\u2019t start out that way.\n\nFifty years ago in London, everyone who was anyone in music was talking about an extraordinary new band blowing everyone else off stage. They hadn\u2019t released an album yet but had played their ground-breaking mix of rock, jazz, classical and psychedelia in storming live sets. One was in front of maybe half a million people, supporting the Rolling Stones at their free concert in Hyde Park, and another reportedly prompted audience-member Jimi Hendrix to call them the best band in the world. Music magazines \u2013 bibles for fans in pre-digital time \u2013 had splashed features on them, and labels were competing for their signatures.\n\nThe band was King Crimson and the album was In the Court of the Crimson King, released 50 years ago this month [Oct]. Like Nirvana\u2019s Nevermind, Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust and Run DMC\u2019s eponymous debut, it was genre-defining. Its five numbers were by turns pastoral, heavy, whimsical, even easy, beginning with an apocalyptic riff and shredded vocal before careering through a bucket-load of influences from hard rock to classical and modern jazz to the Middle Ages, and ending with an epic title-track.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cIt was a game-changer,\u201d King Crimson founder-member and co-writer of every track on the album, Ian McDonald, tells me. \u201cI remember listening back to it and thinking, \u2018What is this?\u2019. Bands went back to the drawing board when they heard it \u2013 I know when Yes heard it they did.\u201d\n\nThis may not have been an entirely good thing. Just four years later Yes toured their No 1 album Tales from Topographic Oceans, a single composition split over four sides of vinyl and inspired by a footnote in the autobiography of an Indian mystic, on a stage designed by a fantasy artist featuring glass-fibre pods that at one gig failed to open, trapping the bassist. They played at such length that keyboard player Rick Wakeman had a curry delivered onstage and ate it while the other members noodled away.\n\nBut that could hardly have been predicted when In the Court of the Crimson King landed. \u201cWe never thought of it as prog-rock,\u201d says McDonald, who played the flute, saxophone, and keyboards. \u201cIt makes me laugh. That term wasn\u2019t being used. We were just doing what we felt the music warranted.\u201d\n\nKing Crimson wasn\u2019t the only British band jettisoning the blues element from rock and aspiring to the complexity and virtuosity of classical music and serious jazz in 1969. That September Deep Purple would play their Concerto for Group and Orchestra with the Royal Philharmonic at the Albert Hall; landmark albums by The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, Genesis, Yes, Pink Floyd and others were released; and future prog-rock royalty Wishbone Ash, Hawkwind and Supertramp all formed. But In the Court of the Crimson King was the watershed moment, \u201can uncanny masterpiece\u201d, according to The Who\u2019s Pete Townshend.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The 40 best albums to listen to before you die Show all 40 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 40 best albums to listen to before you die 1/40 The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967), The Velvet Underground It was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn\u2019t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child\u2019s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, \u201cSunday Morning\u201d, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d is a love song. European Son is rock\u2019n\u2019roll turned sonic shockwave. That\u2019s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called \u201cthe future of music\u201d. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground & Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey 2/40 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha Franklin When Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he \"took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself\". The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown 3/40 Master of Puppets (1986), Metallica Despite not featuring any singles, Metallica\u2019s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they\u2019d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like \u201cDamage Inc\u201d and \u201cOrion\u201d. This album is about storytelling \u2013 the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener \u201cBattery\u201d should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up \u2013 they ripped Dungeons & Dragons clich\u00e9s out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O\u2019Connor 4/40 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads \u201cFacts are simple and facts are straight / Facts are lazy and facts are late\u2026\u201d sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB 5/40 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the Wailers The album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life \u201cwhere the living is hardest\u201d in \u201cConcrete Jungle\u201d and looked back to Jamaica\u2019s ignoble slaving past \u2013 \u201cNo chains around my feet but I\u2019m not free\u201d. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as \u201cHigh Tide and Low Tide\u201d, and rhythmic dance tracks like \u201cKinky Reggae\u201d. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CH 6/40 Revolver (1966), The Beatles An unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney\u2019s \u201cFor No One\u201d and the psychedelia of Lennon\u2019s \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d and \u201cShe Said, She Said\u201d can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HB 7/40 Like a Prayer (1989), Madonna It may be the most \u201cserious\u201d album she\u2019s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible \u2013 pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna\u2019s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in divorce, and she was causing controversy with the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener\u2019s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her \u2013 Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly & the Family Stone, and Simon & Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience \u2013 and the press \u2013 to like her. RO 8/40 Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Led Zeppelin Millennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page\u2019s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant\u2019s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it\u2019s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB 9/40 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-Las Oh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen\u2019s \u2013 \u201cwith their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs\u201d. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. \"Leader of the Pack\" (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH 10/40 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David Bowie Flamboyance, excess, eccentricity \u2013 this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock\u2019s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album \u2013 musically and thematically \u2013 that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. \u201cI\u2019m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m the last person to pretend I\u2019m a radio. I\u2019d rather go out and be a colour television set.\u201d RO 11/40 Unknown Pleasures (1979), Joy Division In their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs \u2013 \"Disorder\", \"She\u2019s Lost Control\" and \"New Dawn Fades\" \u2013 and for those who\u2019d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook\u2019s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on \"I Remember Nothing\" is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CH 12/40 Hejira (1976), Joni Mitchell Though her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of \u201cstrange pillows\u201d and solitude. HB 13/40 Body Talk (2010), Robyn The answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of \u201cHang With Me\u201d (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since \u201cI Feel Love\u201d, \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH 14/40 Off The Wall (1979), Michael Jackson \u201cI will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,\u201d wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HB 15/40 Illmatic (1994), Nas How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music \u2013 not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around \u2013 Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor \u2013 was a move that Complex blamed for \u201cruining hip hop\u201d, while still praising Nas\u2019s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source\u2019s 1991 track \u201cLive at the BBQ\u201d: \u2018When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.\u201d RO 16/40 Trans-Europe Express (1977), Kraftwerk This is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk\u2019s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975\u2019s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter\u2019s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two\u2019s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder\u2019s \"I Feel Love\", Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH 17/40 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles Davis With the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world\u2019s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis\u2019s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale \u201cwithout having to meet the deadline of a particular chord\u201d. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB 18/40 Astral Weeks (1968), Van Morrison \u201cIf I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream\u2026\u201d To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison\u2019s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting \u2013 double bass, classical guitar and flute \u2013 make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH 19/40 West Side Story Soundtrack (1961) \u201cLife is all right in America / If you're all white in America\u201d yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein\u2019s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music; Stephen Sondheim\u2019s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB 20/40 Sign o' the Times (1987), Prince Sign o\u2019 the Times is Prince\u2019s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks \u2013 a double album spanning funk, rock, R&B and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion \u2013 the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o\u2019 the Times, the bass is king \u2013 Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like \u201cAdore\u201d, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. RO 21/40 Pet Sounds (1966), The Beach Boys Caught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HB 22/40 Ys (2006), Joanna Newsom Weave a circle round her thrice\u2026 Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart\u2019s depths \u2013 \u201cStill, my dear, I\u2019d have walked you to the edge of the water\u201d. Ys\u2019s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom\u2019s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you\u2019re bewitched, Ys\u2019s spell never wears off. CH 23/40 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public Enemy Public Enemy\u2019s second album is hip-hop\u2019s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions\u2026 is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, \u201cHere is a land that never gave a damn / About a brother like me,\u201d raps Chuck D on \u201cBlack Steel in the Hour of Chaos\u201d. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH 24/40 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd It\u2019s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and \u201cquiet desperation\u201d of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB 25/40 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn Hill Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones \u2013 sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky \u2013 the former Fugees member stepped out from rap\u2019s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R&B, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D\u2019Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill\u2019s reggae influences are what drive the album\u2019s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it\u2019s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. RO 26/40 Histoire de Melody Nelson (1971), Serge Gainsbourg The great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn\u2019t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier\u2019s heavenly string arrangements. \u201cBallade de Melody Nelson\u201d, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CH 27/40 In My Own Time (1971), Karen Dalton There\u2019s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton\u2019s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge\u2019s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB 28/40 Let England Shake (2011), PJ Harvey \u201cGoddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.\u201d PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: \u201cI\u2019ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,\u201d she sings on \u201cThe Words That Maketh Murder\u201d, \u201cArms and legs are in the trees.\u201d Musically, though, it\u2019s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that\u2019s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH 29/40 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee Rascal It\u2019s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London\u2019s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track \u201cSittin\u2019 Here\u201d. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener\u2019s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO 30/40 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate Bush Proof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush\u2019s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HB 31/40 Blue Lines (1991), Massive Attack A uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective\u2019s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation\u2019s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky\u2019s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson\u2019s exhilarating improvisations. HB 32/40 Surfer Rosa (1987), Pixies It only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges\u2019 Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies\u2019 sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (\u201cyour bone\u2019s got a little machine\u201d). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal\u2019s softer melodic tone won\u2019t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its \u201cloud, quiet, loud\u201d tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain would later say he \u201cwas basically trying to rip off the Pixies\u201d. CH 33/40 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world\u2019s cultural divisions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali\u2019s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California\u2019s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HB 34/40 The Great Gospel Men (1993), Various artists Compared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can\u2019t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener \u201cMove on Up a Little Higher\u201d by Brother Joe May, you\u2019re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from \u201cLord, Lord, Lord\u201d by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland\u2019s \u201cMy Soul Looks Back\u201d are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH 35/40 Hopelessness (2016), Anonhi \u201cA lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,\u201d said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club\u2019s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HB 36/40 In Utero (1993), Nirvana Kurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the \u201ccandy-ass\u201d sound on Nevermind \u2013 the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet \u2013 and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies\u2019 producer Steve Albini to oversee production. It didn\u2019t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. \u201cGO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY\u201d he screams on \u201cScentless Apprentice\u201d, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind\u2019s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. RO 37/40 Curtis (1971), Curtis Mayfield Curtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield\u2019s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon\u2019s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of \u201c(Don\u2019t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We\u2019re All Going to Go\u201d; doleful horns give the politically conscious \u201cWe the People Who Are Darker Than Blue\u201d a profound emotional undertow; \u201cMove On Up\u201d is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CH 38/40 Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac Before they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on \u201cGold Dust Woman\u201d, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time; its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. RO 39/40 Are You Experienced? (1967), Jimi Hendrix A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before \u2013 Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R&B, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That\u2019s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as \u201cPurple Haze\u201d. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d. Hendrix\u2019s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time \u2013 yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RO 40/40 We Are Family (1979), Sister Sledge Disco\u2019s crowning glory is this album that Chic\u2019s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and \u2019Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them \u2013 We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal \u201cGood Times\u201d by Chic \u2013 and this album has four of them, \u201cLost in Music\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019s the Greatest Dancer\u201d, \u201cThinking of You\u201d and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH 1/40 The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967), The Velvet Underground It was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn\u2019t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child\u2019s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, \u201cSunday Morning\u201d, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d is a love song. European Son is rock\u2019n\u2019roll turned sonic shockwave. That\u2019s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called \u201cthe future of music\u201d. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground & Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey 2/40 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha Franklin When Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he \"took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself\". The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown 3/40 Master of Puppets (1986), Metallica Despite not featuring any singles, Metallica\u2019s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they\u2019d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like \u201cDamage Inc\u201d and \u201cOrion\u201d. This album is about storytelling \u2013 the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener \u201cBattery\u201d should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up \u2013 they ripped Dungeons & Dragons clich\u00e9s out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O\u2019Connor 4/40 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads \u201cFacts are simple and facts are straight / Facts are lazy and facts are late\u2026\u201d sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB 5/40 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the Wailers The album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life \u201cwhere the living is hardest\u201d in \u201cConcrete Jungle\u201d and looked back to Jamaica\u2019s ignoble slaving past \u2013 \u201cNo chains around my feet but I\u2019m not free\u201d. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as \u201cHigh Tide and Low Tide\u201d, and rhythmic dance tracks like \u201cKinky Reggae\u201d. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CH 6/40 Revolver (1966), The Beatles An unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney\u2019s \u201cFor No One\u201d and the psychedelia of Lennon\u2019s \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d and \u201cShe Said, She Said\u201d can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HB 7/40 Like a Prayer (1989), Madonna It may be the most \u201cserious\u201d album she\u2019s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible \u2013 pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna\u2019s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in divorce, and she was causing controversy with the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener\u2019s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her \u2013 Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly & the Family Stone, and Simon & Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience \u2013 and the press \u2013 to like her. RO 8/40 Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Led Zeppelin Millennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page\u2019s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant\u2019s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it\u2019s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB 9/40 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-Las Oh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen\u2019s \u2013 \u201cwith their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs\u201d. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. \"Leader of the Pack\" (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH 10/40 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David Bowie Flamboyance, excess, eccentricity \u2013 this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock\u2019s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album \u2013 musically and thematically \u2013 that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. \u201cI\u2019m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m the last person to pretend I\u2019m a radio. I\u2019d rather go out and be a colour television set.\u201d RO 11/40 Unknown Pleasures (1979), Joy Division In their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs \u2013 \"Disorder\", \"She\u2019s Lost Control\" and \"New Dawn Fades\" \u2013 and for those who\u2019d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook\u2019s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on \"I Remember Nothing\" is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CH 12/40 Hejira (1976), Joni Mitchell Though her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of \u201cstrange pillows\u201d and solitude. HB 13/40 Body Talk (2010), Robyn The answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of \u201cHang With Me\u201d (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since \u201cI Feel Love\u201d, \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH 14/40 Off The Wall (1979), Michael Jackson \u201cI will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,\u201d wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HB 15/40 Illmatic (1994), Nas How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music \u2013 not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around \u2013 Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor \u2013 was a move that Complex blamed for \u201cruining hip hop\u201d, while still praising Nas\u2019s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source\u2019s 1991 track \u201cLive at the BBQ\u201d: \u2018When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.\u201d RO 16/40 Trans-Europe Express (1977), Kraftwerk This is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk\u2019s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975\u2019s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter\u2019s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two\u2019s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder\u2019s \"I Feel Love\", Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH 17/40 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles Davis With the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world\u2019s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis\u2019s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale \u201cwithout having to meet the deadline of a particular chord\u201d. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB 18/40 Astral Weeks (1968), Van Morrison \u201cIf I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream\u2026\u201d To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison\u2019s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting \u2013 double bass, classical guitar and flute \u2013 make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH 19/40 West Side Story Soundtrack (1961) \u201cLife is all right in America / If you're all white in America\u201d yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein\u2019s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music; Stephen Sondheim\u2019s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB 20/40 Sign o' the Times (1987), Prince Sign o\u2019 the Times is Prince\u2019s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks \u2013 a double album spanning funk, rock, R&B and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion \u2013 the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o\u2019 the Times, the bass is king \u2013 Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like \u201cAdore\u201d, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. RO 21/40 Pet Sounds (1966), The Beach Boys Caught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HB 22/40 Ys (2006), Joanna Newsom Weave a circle round her thrice\u2026 Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart\u2019s depths \u2013 \u201cStill, my dear, I\u2019d have walked you to the edge of the water\u201d. Ys\u2019s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom\u2019s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you\u2019re bewitched, Ys\u2019s spell never wears off. CH 23/40 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public Enemy Public Enemy\u2019s second album is hip-hop\u2019s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions\u2026 is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, \u201cHere is a land that never gave a damn / About a brother like me,\u201d raps Chuck D on \u201cBlack Steel in the Hour of Chaos\u201d. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH 24/40 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd It\u2019s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and \u201cquiet desperation\u201d of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB 25/40 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn Hill Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones \u2013 sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky \u2013 the former Fugees member stepped out from rap\u2019s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R&B, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D\u2019Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill\u2019s reggae influences are what drive the album\u2019s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it\u2019s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. RO 26/40 Histoire de Melody Nelson (1971), Serge Gainsbourg The great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn\u2019t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier\u2019s heavenly string arrangements. \u201cBallade de Melody Nelson\u201d, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CH 27/40 In My Own Time (1971), Karen Dalton There\u2019s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton\u2019s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge\u2019s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB 28/40 Let England Shake (2011), PJ Harvey \u201cGoddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.\u201d PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: \u201cI\u2019ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,\u201d she sings on \u201cThe Words That Maketh Murder\u201d, \u201cArms and legs are in the trees.\u201d Musically, though, it\u2019s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that\u2019s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH 29/40 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee Rascal It\u2019s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London\u2019s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track \u201cSittin\u2019 Here\u201d. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener\u2019s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO 30/40 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate Bush Proof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush\u2019s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HB 31/40 Blue Lines (1991), Massive Attack A uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective\u2019s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation\u2019s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky\u2019s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson\u2019s exhilarating improvisations. HB 32/40 Surfer Rosa (1987), Pixies It only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges\u2019 Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies\u2019 sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (\u201cyour bone\u2019s got a little machine\u201d). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal\u2019s softer melodic tone won\u2019t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its \u201cloud, quiet, loud\u201d tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain would later say he \u201cwas basically trying to rip off the Pixies\u201d. CH 33/40 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world\u2019s cultural divisions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali\u2019s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California\u2019s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HB 34/40 The Great Gospel Men (1993), Various artists Compared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can\u2019t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener \u201cMove on Up a Little Higher\u201d by Brother Joe May, you\u2019re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from \u201cLord, Lord, Lord\u201d by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland\u2019s \u201cMy Soul Looks Back\u201d are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH 35/40 Hopelessness (2016), Anonhi \u201cA lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,\u201d said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club\u2019s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HB 36/40 In Utero (1993), Nirvana Kurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the \u201ccandy-ass\u201d sound on Nevermind \u2013 the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet \u2013 and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies\u2019 producer Steve Albini to oversee production. It didn\u2019t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. \u201cGO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY\u201d he screams on \u201cScentless Apprentice\u201d, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind\u2019s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. RO 37/40 Curtis (1971), Curtis Mayfield Curtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield\u2019s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon\u2019s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of \u201c(Don\u2019t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We\u2019re All Going to Go\u201d; doleful horns give the politically conscious \u201cWe the People Who Are Darker Than Blue\u201d a profound emotional undertow; \u201cMove On Up\u201d is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CH 38/40 Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac Before they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on \u201cGold Dust Woman\u201d, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time; its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. RO 39/40 Are You Experienced? (1967), Jimi Hendrix A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before \u2013 Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R&B, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That\u2019s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as \u201cPurple Haze\u201d. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d. Hendrix\u2019s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time \u2013 yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RO 40/40 We Are Family (1979), Sister Sledge Disco\u2019s crowning glory is this album that Chic\u2019s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and \u2019Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them \u2013 We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal \u201cGood Times\u201d by Chic \u2013 and this album has four of them, \u201cLost in Music\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019s the Greatest Dancer\u201d, \u201cThinking of You\u201d and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH\n\nThe group were led by guitar wizard Robert Fripp, a master of unusual tunings and complex chords and voicings, says McDonald. Fripp is the one constant in King Crimson over 50 years. He also provided that sustained feedback guitar wail on David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d. Bassist and lead vocalist was Greg Lake, who would go on to mega-proggers Emerson Lake and Palmer. McDonald, who would co-found late-1970s AOR giants Foreigner (\u201cI Want to Know What Love Is\u201d) brought a range of influences \u2013 \u201carmy bandsman, male voice choir, jazz trio\u2026\u201d. A flute solo he played on the title track \u201cwas a direct nod to [Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s] Scheherazade\u201d, and he also played the Mellotron, an early sampling keyboard The Beatles had used, recording it through a Marshall stack to get an \u201cenormous\u201d sound.\n\nPoet Peter Sinfield\u2019s lyrics unwittingly set a template for much of prog, admits McDonald: \u201cSome of them were medieval-sounding. Unfortunately, that has meant people have thought progressive rock requires dragons and fairies.\u201d Sinfield went on to write for Buck\u2019s Fizz. It\u2019s hard to know which is the more regrettable.\n\nAnother element of the template for prog set by the album was the cover, a brightly coloured nightmare face painted by Sinfield\u2019s friend, Barry Godber. It seemed to have transcended packaging to become art in the same way the music appeared to have gone beyond simplistic forms to do the same. Prog acts that followed learned their lesson \u2013 Roger Dean\u2019s images of alien landscapes arguably did as much for Yes\u2019s popularity as any mystical lyric.\n\nIn the Court of the Crimson King opened floodgates. Yes, ELP, Pink Floyd and others sold prog albums by the tens of millions. Mike Oldfield\u2019s 1973 Tubular Bells stayed in the UK chart for a year, while Pink Floyd\u2019s Dark Side of the Moon has now sold nearly 50 million copies. But then came punk with its DIY minimalism and lo-fi ethic that almost instantly made any prog act look ridiculous. Robert Fripp wasn\u2019t surprised \u2013 many of these prog acts had gone \u201ctragically off-course\u201d, he has said, adding, \u201cKC had the wit to cease to exist in 1974; which makes those who associate KC, with \u2018the bombastic excesses of prog rock\u2019 and those who served them up, at least as dopey.\u201d\n\nYet prog refuses to die. Annie Clark (St Vincent) has described how she learned to play Jethro Tull, one of the bands jolted into changing their sound by In the Court of the Crimson King, in her teens in a practice room decked with a King Crimson poster, while bands from Marillion through Radiohead to Mars Volta and Muse have used, abused, or reinvented prog (even if, like Radiohead, they vehemently refuse to admit it). And Fripp has reformed King Crimson several times in a variety of guises \u2013 this month the latest incarnation end a world tour.\n\nMeanwhile, as McDonald says, \u201c50 years later, the album still holds up\u201d. He\u2019s right, it does. Which is more than you can say for Tales of Topographic Oceans. With or without a curry.\n\nTo mark their 50th anniversary, King Crimson have put their catalogue on Apple music and Spotify. Ian McDonald\u2019s current band, Honey West, have just released a \u201ccollector\u2019s edition\u201d of their critically acclaimed debut album, Bad Old World (www.honeywestmusic.com)", "description": "An improvised crumhorn solo in a madrigal in 15/8 time inspired by the dream of a minor character from Lord of the Rings? It could only happen in prog-rock. But it didn\u2019t start out that way.", "authors": ["Simon Hardeman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/15/King-Crimson-1974.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
