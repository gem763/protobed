You know what, guys? We\u2019re not.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe Nina and Paul aren\u2019t, but Elena and Stefan might be, amiright?\n\nThe Fast and Furious eight actress had been \u2018talking about all of the wonderful things that I love about Paul Wesley\u2019 at the time and had been referring to only \u2018a very brief moment in time [when] we did not get along.\u2019\n\nNina insists that it was only a little blip in their relationship (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Just like any human wouldn\u2019t,\u2019 she said. \u2018If you said that you and your parents have loved each other unconditionally and your siblings from the moment you were born until the day that you die, you\u2019d be a f**king liar.\u2019\n\nNina insisted that they were \u2018best friends\u2019 and any kinks in their relationship was just a part of becoming a family on set.\n\n\u2018You spend every waking moment together \u2013 probably more moments than you do with your real family because you\u2019re there from, like, five in the morning until midnight, six am sometimes,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018So you see each other with makeup, without makeup, on good days, on bad days, when you\u2019re hungry, when you\u2019re thirsty, when you\u2019re tired. So, there are going to be mood swings.\u2019\n\nNina went on to say: \u2018It was one of those things that we just \u2013 it\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t like each other. We just didn\u2019t appreciate each other as much as we do now \u2013 and that, of course, got blown [out] of proportion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They took one sentence out of context and deleted all of the other ones where I\u2019m like, \u201cI love him. We\u2019re best friends now\u201d.\u2019\n\nNina was part of The Vampire Diaries as a lead from season one to six, and continued to appear on the show\u2019s season seven and eight before it came to a close in March 2017.\n\nPaul on the other hand said they drove each other insane (The CW)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s bittersweet and nostalgic to think back at, I mean, youth,\u2019 Nina reminisced.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a moment in time that we\u2019ll never get back, and I look back at it so fondly \u2013 including all of the bad days that Paul Wesley had and that I had. It made us who we are in the best way possible.\u2019\n\nDespite Nina\u2019s best intentions, Paul had a slightly different characterisation of their relationship...\n\nEarlier this year the actor admitted that the pair \u2018clashed\u2019 and \u2018didn\u2019t get along\u2019 at first.\n\nPaul told Entertainment Tonight: \u2018When we first started shooting The Vampire Diaries, we totally clashed. We didn\u2019t [get along].\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Creatively, it just wasn\u2019t in sync.\u2019\n\nThe actor went on to say that though they eventually \u2018developed love\u2019 for one another, it wasn\u2019t before they drove each other insane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The fans would never have known that. We\u2019re basically driving each other insane and then after a few seasons, we developed this absolute mutual love.\u2019\n\nHmm\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
