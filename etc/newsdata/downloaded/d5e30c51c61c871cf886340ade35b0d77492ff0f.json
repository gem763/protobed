SIHG is a primary investment and financing entity for the Shangrao municipal government to invest and operate in various key business segments and assets, including urban development and infrastructure construction, water supply and sewage, toll roads, public transportation and airport operation, tourism and financial services. Key Rating Drivers Very Strong Status, Ownership and Control: SIHG is 97.6% owned by the Shangrao State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (Shangrao SASAC). The company is directly managed, supervised and controlled by Shangrao government via Shangrao SASAC. The board of directors is SIHG's highest decision-making body. All board members are either appointed or nominated by the municipal committee and the government. Any changes in the board of supervisors or the board of directors need to be approved by the government. 'Strong' Support Record and Expectations: SIHG has a record of receiving frequent support from the Shangrao government, including subsidies and capital injections. Government subsidies accounted for 50% of net profit from 2016-2018. The subsidies were mainly to support urban development projects. In addition, the Shangrao SASAC has increased the company's paid-in capital of CNY8.7 billion by cash during 2017 and 2018. The government has swapped a total of CNY13.0 billion of the company's debt since 2014. 'Strong' Socio-Political Implications of Default: We believe a default by SIHG could adversely affect the municipality's urban development, key public utilities and tourism, in light of the strategic importance of the assets it operates as well as its almost monopolistic status in these areas. A default by SIHG would hurt the municipality, as its wide-ranging businesses affect the municipality's everyday operations and it cannot be immediately substituted by other entities. 'Very Strong' Financial Implications of Default: We believe a default by SIHG would hamper significantly the municipality's financing capacity. The government exploits its primary financing and investment entity to facilitate urban development projects and operate critical public utilities. Public works under the contractual framework are awarded to public entities, which rely on SIHG for the majority of financing to make these essential public works viable. 'b' Standalone Credit Profile: Fitch assesses SIHG's Standalone Credit Profile as 'b', based on a 'Midrange' demand defensibility, 'Midrange' operating risk and 'Weaker' financial profile. SIHG's financial profile in the past few years has been characterised by large capex and high leverage, resulting in a Fitch-adjusted net debt/EBITDA ratio of 30x in 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES A change in Fitch's credit assessment of the Shangrao municipality or the municipality's ability to provide subsidies, grants or other legitimate resources allowed under China's policies and regulations could result in a change in SIHG's ratings. A significant weakening of the socio-political and financial implications of a default by SIHG or deterioration in Fitch's expectations of support, or a dilution of the government's shareholding, may result in a downgrade. An improvement or deterioration of SIHG's Standalone Credit Profile or liquidity position of SIHG would also affect the ratings.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers. For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
