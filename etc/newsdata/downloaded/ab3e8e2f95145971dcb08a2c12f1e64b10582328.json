The feature is available for customers who've bought Full Self-Driving Capability or Enhanced Autopilot.\n\nThe company says customers have praised summon it for its convenience after shopping, but notes that \"those using Smart Summon must remain responsible for the car and monitor it and its surroundings at all times\". The feature is available to drivers when the car is within their line of sight.\n\nThe update also brings Spotify Premium access in all supported markets, which customers have been clamoring for, according to Tesla. That's in addition to two other music apps, Slacker Radio and TuneIn.\n\nOwners of the Model 3 Standard Range Plus and Standard Range vehicles will now able to stream Spotify, TuneIn, and Slacker when connected to Wi-Fi.\n\nOther features include a karaoke app that's filled with a \"massive\" library of lyrics and multi-language support, as well as navigation features called 'I'm feeling lucky' and 'I'm feeling hungry', which take drivers to destinations and restaurants, respectively. Tesla promises it will be adventurous, too.\n\n\"In testing, we've been taken to hole-in-the-wall restaurants, gourmet meals, national parks, city landmarks and more,\" it says.\n\nTesla's maps have been updated so that search results are sorted by distance to each destination.\n\nIt's also done some tidying up on the security front for Dashcam and Sentry Mode. Dashcam records the driver while driving, and Sentry Mode focuses on people nearby but outside the vehicle.\n\nNow Sentry Mode video clips are stored in a separate folder on the user's USB drive and older clips are automatically deleted if the drive is low on space.\n\nMore on Tesla, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars", "description": "Tesla has released Software Version 10.0 with new entertainment apps and the parking-lot summon feature.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/3cec2f96-0356-4c7b-9c84-532f38bbe8e7/thumbnail/770x578/1c3fee110b1fe4482f1318af54230045/model-s-0011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
