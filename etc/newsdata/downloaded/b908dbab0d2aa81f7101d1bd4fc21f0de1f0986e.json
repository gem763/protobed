Five crew members were rescued near Santa Cruz Island, about 30 miles off Santa Barbara.\n\nThe others are all feared dead. Four bodies had been recovered near the boat and brought ashore by Monday night, all with injuries consistent with drowning, said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Kroll. Four other bodies had been located at the site but not yet recovered, authorities said.\n\nLate Monday night, Amber Anderson of the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management confirmed to USA TODAY that \"additional victims are being received.\" However, she declined to offer any additional information about the number of victims, saying that there will be an update at a press conference at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\n\"This is probably the worst-case scenario you could possibly have,\" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. \u201cYou have a vessel that\u2019s on the open sea in the middle of the night. Fire is the scourge of any ship. The majority of the people were the passengers on the ship, and the sleeping compartment was in the bottom deck of the ship so they would\u2019ve been sound asleep when the fire started. ... You couldn\u2019t ask for a worse situation.\u201d\n\n'Nothing can prepare you for that': Boat owner describes saving distressed crew members after Santa Cruz Island boat fire\n\nCapt. Monica Rochester of the U.S. Coast Guard said in a Monday press conference at Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard, California, that the five individuals who were rescued were sleeping on the top deck of the boat when they woke up. They jumped off and were rescued by a Good Samaritan boat called the Grape Escape.\n\nIn audio from a mayday call from the Conception, a Coast Guard dispatcher is heard asking about the passengers\u2019 safety.\n\n\u201cRoger, there are 33 people on board the vessel that's on fire and they can't get off,\u201d the dispatcher asks. The response is unintelligible. The dispatcher then asks, \u201cRoger, are they locked inside the boat?\u201d\n\nUnited States Coast Guard members transfer a body at the Santa Barbara Harbor on Sept. 2, 2019. More\n\nConsidering the situation, \"We should all be prepared to move to the worst outcome,\" Rochester told reporters.\n\nAuthorities have obtained the sign-in sheet for the passengers aboard the vessel, Public Information Officer. Lt. Eric Raney said, but the list does not include ages or hometowns. Officials are still trying to reach passengers\u2019 family members.\n\nAbout 15 families had visited the family assistance center by Monday afternoon, said Suzanne Grimmesey with Santa Barbara County Department of Behavioral Wellness. Several families came from out of town, including from Northern California.\n\n\u201cPeople come in in a state of shock, I think, with worry, with questions \u2014 perhaps carrying a bit of hope as well,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they come in the door, they have a lot of support there for them.\u201d\n\n'No escape hatch' for passengers: Read transcript of Santa Cruz boat mayday call\n\nBrown said he does not know if there is a black box aboard the Conception. The initial broadcast did not indicate any explosion sparked the fire, he said, and there is no reason to suspect any criminal activity.\n\nBob Hansen, owner of the Grape Escape, said he and his wife were sleeping when they were awakened by the five crew members banging on the side of their boat from their lifeboat.\n\n\u201cThe flames are probably 30 feet high,\" Hansen told USA TODAY of the boat fire. \"This is probably one of those things you cannot unsee. It\u2019s very vivid. I can see that thing burning and it\u2019s all the way, right down almost to the water. It was fast.\"", "description": "Dozens of passengers still have not been accounted for after a diving boat caught fire and sank near California's Santa Cruz Island.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Joshua Bote", "David Oliver", "Kristin Lam", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kHTdUUojKJpsUuligUgqtQ--~B/aD00NzA4O3c9NzA2MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/85d8a1406a389e8333fbfd02d7fcff6b"}
