Sheertex Shoes are now available on Kickstarter and will be shipping Spring 2020. The Sheertex Shoe has been developed from the same proprietary knit technology behind company\u2019s unbreakable sheers, which uses proprietary fibers made from the world\u2019s strongest polymer. The knit has a strength-to-weight ratio eight times that of steel, floats on water, is naturally antimicrobial, cool to the touch and resistant to moisture, making it perfect for activewear.\n\n\n\nThe idea of a knit shoe made in the world\u2019s strongest polymer has been on the company\u2019s dream list of products for over a year, but prototyping the Sheertex Shoe kicked off just two weeks ago. From start to finish, the creation has been followed by the company\u2019s fans across social media, with followers providing real-time feedback as the team travelled to Italy to finalize its designs. Sheertex\u2019s unique approach to product development focuses on real-time iteration. Over the last month alone the company has launched more than a dozen new styles of its core product, and expects to do the same with shoes once they start shipping in the spring.\n\nLike the company\u2019s pantyhose, Sheertex Shoes will be manufactured in-house at the Sheertex factory in Montreal. The shoes feature a smooth design with no tongue or laces making it the perfect everyday shoe. The extremely strong materials in the Sheertex knit do not compromise comfort or flexibility, rather they enable the use of finer lighter weight fibers than any other shoe on the market today. Sheertex Shoes are comfortable to wear, quick drying and designed for the wear and tear of real life.\n\n\u201cIn January we shipped our first pair of Sheertex pantyhose, and since that time we\u2019ve grown faster than we ever imagined. We\u2019ve gone from a 2100 square foot factory to running the largest hosiery factory in Canada. We\u2019re thrilled to see the response the market has had to our sheers and are excited to expand our knit technology to many different apparel categories,\u201d said Katherine Homuth, Founder and CEO of Sheertex. \u201cWhen we set out to create unbreakable pantyhose we had no idea we\u2019d also develop the world\u2019s strongest light-weight sheer knit in the process. Sheertex Shoes are the first non-hosiery product we\u2019ve developed and it takes advantage of our knit technology in an entirely new way.\u201d\n\nSheertex Shoes are available for pre-order on Kickstarter for an early bird price of $85 with prices going up to $95 after the early bird sells out. Sheertex Sheers will retail for $145 in the spring.
