The defense argued hard for a life sentence during the penalty phase this week, with one saying the 39-year-old Haskell should spend the rest of his life thinking about what he has done and \"die in prison.\"\n\nICE: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TARGETED ALLEGED RAPE VICTIM AFTER RELEASE\n\nIn Texas, insanity is rarely used as a defense and seldom successful. Haskell's attorneys said his long history of mental illness, in which he was treated by multiple doctors, should be considered by the jury as a mitigating factor in sentencing.\n\nProsecutors said Haskell had planned to kill anyone who helped his ex-wife Melanie Lyon after she left him. Katie Stay was Melanie\u2019s sister and had traveled from her home in Houston to Melanie\u2019s home in Utah to help her sister leave Haskell.\n\nLyon testified that after Haskell physically abused her and their children, the couple divorced and she moved to Texas to be with her family. Authorities said Haskell traveled from California and stalked Lyon\u2019s family for two days before murdering all but one member of Lyon\u2019s sister\u2019s family.\n\nHaskell killed Stephen and Katie Stay and their children Zach, 4, Rebecca, 7, Emily, 9, and Bryan, 13. During closing arguments in the punishment phase of Haskell's trial earlier Friday, prosecutor Kaylynn Williford described how Haskell shot 4-year-old Zach in the shoulder \u2014 an injury he could have survived \u2014 and said the frightened child scurried in the chaos to his father on a couch, burying his head in his father's shoulder for protection.\n\nTEXAS MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY BRINGING LOADED 9MM TO SCHOOL: REPORTS\n\nBut by that point, Zach's father was already dead, Williford said.\n\n\"He scrambles over to his father, because that's what little boys do,\" Williford said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHaskell then went over to Zach, pointed a gun to the back of his head and pulled the trigger, she said.\n\n\"How cold and vengeful do you have to be to take the life of a 4-year-old?\" Williford said.\n\nCassidy Stay, the couple\u2019s then-15-year-old daughter, survived the slaughter by pretending to be dead after she was shot in the head. She then called the police to tell them Haskell was on his way to the home of her grandparents and police arrested him before he arrived. Cassidy testified at the trial that she begged her uncle \"please don't hurt us\" before Haskell opened fire.\n\nFox News' Louis Casiano and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Texas jury sentenced a man who killed six members of his ex-wife\u2019s family to\u00a0death Friday after approximately four hours of deliberations.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19269713653345.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
