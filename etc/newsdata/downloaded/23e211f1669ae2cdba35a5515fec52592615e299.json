With talks intensifying and deadlines slipping, major issues remain unresolved on the final day before Boris Johnson seeks sign-off during a key EU summit starting tomorrow. Follow live updates here. The Prime Minister needs a deal approved by EU leaders if he is to avoid an almighty clash over asking for a delay to the UK's departure.
