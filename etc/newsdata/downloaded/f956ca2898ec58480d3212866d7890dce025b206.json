But the Pixel 4 isn\u2019t the only thing we\u2019re expecting to see at the upcoming Made By Google Event on Tuesday, October 15th at 10AM ET.\n\nThanks to Google absorbing the Nest brand earlier this year, Google looks poised to announce a new wave of smart home products including a Google Nest Mini and a Google Nest Wifi. Leaks also suggest that Google is planning on launching a follow up to its flagship Chromebook\u2014the Pixelbook\u2014which was released back in 2017.\n\nAnd like every other big tech company this year, it seems Google may wade into the true wireless earbuds game with the Pixel Buds 2. Also, even with all the leaks and rumours, Google usually manages to have some last-minute surprises in store too. Here\u2019s everything we\u2019re expecting to see at Made by Google 2019, but don\u2019t be surprised if there might be a little more.\n\nPixel 4 Hardware\n\nWell, since there seems to be some interest, here you go! Wait 'til you see what it can do. #Pixel4 pic.twitter.com/RnpTNZXEI1 \u2014 Made by Google (@madebygoogle) June 12, 2019\n\nEarlier this summer, Google released an official picture of the Pixel 4, which shed light on a number of new features including the presence of dual rear cameras (a first for any Pixel phone) and the lack of a rear fingerprint reader, which implies the Pixel 4 will feature an in-display finger sensor of some kind similar to what you get on phones like the Galaxy S10 and OnePlus 7 Pro.\n\nThen, a month and a half later, Google went even further when it released a teaser video showing the Pixel 4 using facial recognition to unlock the phone while also showing off the Pixel 4's Motion Sense gesture controls, which uses tiny radar chips to track the movement of your hands to do things like skip songs, snooze alarms, and silence phone calls.\n\nAs for the Pixel 4's guts, according to a leaked spec sheet obtained by 9to5Google, we\u2019re looking at a 15cm full HD+ screen for the standard Pixel 4 and a 15cm QHD+ screen for Pixel 4 XL, with both models featuring displays with 90Hz refresh rates for extra smoothness.\n\nBoth models will also come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and something Google is calling the Pixel Neural Core, which will almost certainly assist with tasks related to AI and machine learning. The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will also feature 6GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage, stereo speakers, and a USB-C port. This leaked spec sheet also lists the Pixel 4's rear cameras as having a 12-MP main sensor and a 16-MP sensor for its 2x telephoto cam.\n\nAll told these are solid, though not exactly mindblowing specs. Though as previous Pixel phones haven proven before, you don\u2019t need tons of RAM or giant screens to make a good phone.\n\nPixel 4 Camera Features\n\nOne thing that\u2019s even more important than the Pixel 4's components is its software, particularly when it comes to the Pixel\u2019s camera. Previous camera modes from Google like Night Sight, Super Res Zoom, and the Timelapse mode demonstrated the potential of computational photography, and with the Pixel 4, Google looks like it has even more camera tricks in store.\n\nBased on a source who spoke to 9to5Google, the Pixel 4 will have a new Motion Mode designed to help people capture fast-moving subjects while making sure the image looks sharp and in focus.\n\nNext, by analysing new code in version 6.3 of the Google Camera app, a member of the XDA developers community discovered clues pointing to modes such as Live HDR (for brighter, more colourful video), Audio Zoom (which allows the phone to adjust noise isolation based on what you zoom in on), and an improved selfie mode that uses a new algorithm to correct for wide-angle distortion.\n\nNight Sight also seems to be getting some general speed and quality improvements and maybe even the ability to do some astrophotography thanks to a new mode that will help \u201ctake photos of the starry sky.\u201d\n\nGoogle Nest Mini and Google Nest Wifi\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since the Google Home Mini was first released, and with the Nest family of devices having been folded into Google\u2019s lineup of devices, Google now looks to be using this event to refresh some of its most important smart home products.\n\nThe only port on the existing Google Home Mini is a power jack, so a new 3.5mm jack would be a nice addition. (Photo: Adam Clark Estes, Gizmodo)\n\nFor the new Google Nest Mini, a source who spoke to 9to5Google claims that while the new device will have a similar shape and size to the current Home Mini, it will get a few upgrades including a built-in 3.5mm jack, better speakers with deeper bass, some sort of wall mount, and new proximity awareness sensors. But in the end, the Nest Mini\u2019s main purpose will still be to serve as a cheap and easy way of enabling voice search and commands via the Google Assistant.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nest Wifi will get a new design featuring \u201cbeacons\u201d that help add range to your mesh wifi network while also doubling as Google Assistant speakers. Adding Google Assistant integration will allow users to do things like suspend internet service in specific rooms using voice commands. It should also support Wifi 6 which offers improved latency, bandwidth, and faster wireless speeds.\n\nPixelbook Go\n\nWith Google having sworn off making tablets earlier this year, the Pixelbook Go looks to be a more traditional Chrome OS laptop with a clamshell design. It was first spied way back in July under the codename \u201cAtlas\u201d before more details leaked earlier this month. With its name suggesting a clear focus on portability, the Pixelbook Go looks to be a pretty simple device featuring a 33cm screen (with 1080 or 4K resolution options), 8GB or 16GB of RAM, up to 256GB of storage, and a range of Intel m3, i5, and i7 CPUs.\n\nThe Pixelbook Go also reportedly has powerful stereo speakers, but the most interesting thing about the Pixelbook may end up being its wavy bottom, which just this week, was shown off by 9to5Google who managed to get a functioning pre-production sample of Google\u2019s upcoming laptop.\n\nPixel Buds 2\n\nFinally, while very little has been leaked about the Pixel Buds 2, a lot of rumours and whispers say that Google is preparing to announce a second-gen model of the original Pixel Buds. Like everything else Google makes, we expect the Pixel Buds 2 to feature Google Assistant integration in addition to an improved version of its live translate feature from the previous model. We just hope the Pixel Buds 2 won\u2019t have a cord running between the two earbuds, as that would essentially doom the device now that Samsung, Amazon, and Microsoft have joined Apple, Jabra, and others with their own take on true wireless earbuds.\n\nOK, so what else?\n\nThere\u2019s always a chance Google could announce expanded support for Duplex or something wacky like a version of the Google Clips. But if you\u2019ve been waiting to see the long-rumoured Pixel Watch, things are a lot more uncertain. At first, it seemed like there was no chance a Pixel Watch would be ready this fall, but recently, a report from the Nikkei Asian Review claims Google could show off a 5G version of the Pixel 4 and the Pixel Watch at its upcoming product launch.", "description": "After months of teases and leaks, there\u2019s a lot we know about the Pixel 4.
