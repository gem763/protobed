On Tuesday, Tobii Pro announced a new, portable eye tracker called Tobii Pro Fusion designed to solve that problem.\n\nThe Tobii Pro Fusion is a lightweight peripheral device that can be connected to any screen via USB. It's designed for researchers who want to run lab-standard experiments and collect data outside of a lab setting.\n\nThe new device should be easy to carry along with a laptop -- it only weighs 168 grams (that's less than six ounces) and it measures 374 mm x 18 mm x 13.7 mm (making the slim bar about 14.7 inches long).\n\nBj\u00f6rn Qvarfordt\n\nTobii Pro, the research-focused arm of the eye-tracking company Tobii, has already taken steps to make eye-tracking research more portable, in part by integrating its technology into HTC Vive VR headsets.\n\nEye tracking is used to study human behavior in a number of fields, including psychology, developmental studies, medical research, cognitive science and neuroscience. It's helped psychologists working on detecting signs of autism and neuroscientists studying the effects of treatments on Parkinson's disease.\n\nHowever, as Tobii Pro noted in a blog post, data shows that a substantial portion of behavioral research over-relies so-called WEIRD participants -- participants from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. countries. That sample bias derives from the fact that it's simply difficult for scientists to find research participants outside of the WEIRD profile.\n\nA more portable eye tracker, the company notes, should let researchers find study participants who can't afford to take time off and come into a lab, or participants who live in more remote locations.\n\nSome of the Tobii Pro Fusion's features include:", "description": "Lightweight and easy to connect to a PC, the Tobii Pro Fusion aims to let researchers take the latest eye-tracking technology outside of the lab, reaching populations typically overlooked in behavioral science.", "authors": ["Stephanie Condon"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/14/b2df8898-0418-4302-bc73-3006047981a4/thumbnail/770x578/5cc0aa00a5161c80979da0ffc226fc21/eye-tracking-study-at-school-with-tobii-pro-fusion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
