Abe said he would install Hiroshi Kajiyama -- a veteran in his ruling Liberal Democratic Party and a former minister for regional economic revitalization -- in Sugawara\u2019s place.\n\nWhile the resignation is an embarrassment for Abe, who\u2019s on track to become Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister next month, he has weathered far worse storms before. The replacement isn\u2019t likely to dent support for his rule over the world\u2019s third-largest economy.\n\n\u201cI am responsible for the appointment and I apologize for it,\u201d Abe told reporters, adding he wanted no pause in his plans to keep the economy moving. The swap won\u2019t affect Japanese trade relations with the U.S., which are being managed by Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.\n\nPressure mounted on Sugawara this week when the Shukan Bunshun magazine published an article alleging that Sugawara\u2019s secretary gave 20,000 yen ($185) in condolence money to a supporter\u2019s family and made other inappropriate offerings to followers. Japanese law prohibits these types of donations, which can be seen as a form of vote buying and influence peddling.\n\nIt was a repeat scandal for Sugawara, who previously faced similar allegations of making illegal donations to constituents more than a decade ago in the form of pricey melons and crabs, the magazine report said. But the statute of limitations had expired before any action was taken.\n\nSugawara\u2019s replacement, Kajiyama, 64, is the son of an LDP stalwart. He worked at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency before joining his father in politics. Abe first appointed him to the cabinet in 2017.\n\nThe Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has been at the forefront of export restrictions placed on items sent to South Korea as a part of an escalating feud between the neighbors. The ministry is also playing a role in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade deal among Southeast Asian nations and other Asian partners.\n\nJapan and others are pushing for a final deal by the end of the year, with the RCEP pact getting a fresh push at the meeting of ASEAN leaders that starts next week.\n\nHidden Gold, \u2018Murky\u2019 Payoffs Threaten Japan Nuclear Revival\n\nThe ministry is also responsible for oversight of the nuclear power industry, which is facing one of its worsts crises since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. A payoff scandal rocking the industry, which emerged at the end of last month, centers around how an influential municipal official in a town that hosts a nuclear plant spent years doling out large gifts to executives of its operator, Kansai Electric Power Co.\n\nSugawara took charge of looking into payoffs in the industry and said this month that Japan would respond \u201cstrictly\u201d to Kansai Electric after a third-party investigation is complete.\n\n(Adds comment from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe)", "description": "Japan\u2019s Abe Replaces Economy Minister After Funeral Gift Scandal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic2782ac75e85b04108c72b0b7c3860923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
