If we ask you to evacuate, please evacuate,\u201d he urged residents.\n\nHe said some 1,000 firefighters were fighting the blaze that was zero percent contained in early morning and which forced the partial shutdown of several major highways. The metro line in the area was also shut down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve calculated that the fire is moving at a rate of 800 acres per hour,\u201d Terrazas said, adding that it would probably take days to get it under control.\n\nSome 200 firefighters and helicopters were meanwhile battling the brush fire \u2014 dubbed the Sandlewood fire \u2014 that tore through the mobile home park.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries, but authorities ordered some 1,900 homes in the area be evacuated.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said on Twitter it had declared a \u201ccitywide tactical alert.\u201d\n\nEvacuation centers are open for those forced to leave their homes, said LA mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\n\u2013 In the dark \u2013\n\nWeather forecasters have warned of more strong winds and \u201cextremely critical fire\u201d conditions Friday and state authorities have issued their highest fire alert \u2014 a red flag warning.\n\nThe wildfires erupted as California\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), implemented rolling power blackouts that affected some two million people in Northern California this week.\n\nAbout 312,000 customers remained in the dark Friday as a result of the shutoffs designed to reduce the threat of wildfire that can be sparked by lines downed in heavy winds.\n\nMany schools and universities were also closed in northern parts of the state as people stocked up on gasoline, water, batteries and other basics, with frustration mounting at the blackouts condemned by some as \u201cthird world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a scale and scope of something that no state in the 21st century should experience,\u201d Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday, blaming decades of what he called neglect and mismanagement by PG&E.\n\n\u201cThis is not, from my perspective, a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cNeglect, a desire to advance not public safety but profits.\u201d\n\nPG&E has defended the outages as necessary for safety reasons and has said it will take days before power is restored to all customers as inspections must be conducted on power lines in all of the affected areas.\n\n\u201cThis is not how we want to serve you but blackouts can happen again,\u201d Bill Johnson, the CEO of the company said Thursday.\n\nLast November, PG&E\u2019s faulty power lines were determined to have sparked the deadliest wildfire in the state\u2019s modern history, which killed 86 and destroyed the town of Paradise.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Much of California was on high alert Friday as wind-driven wildfires tore through the state\u2019s south, forcing the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/b6a927_flames-saddleridge-approach-home-in-porter-ranch-section-los-angeles-california-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
