Or \u2014 worse \u2014 they\u2019ve been captured by big-money special interests.\n\nImplicitly or explicitly, a slate of recent books and essays suggests that this was a core failing of the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and others considered to be Democratic moderates. The takeaway: Democrats\u2019 inability to implement single-payer, a student-debt jubilee, a Green New Deal or other ideas on the progressive wish list is because of either insufficient political will or impure motives.\n\nBut what if the real reason is something else entirely? What if it\u2019s that Democrats have used research and evidence to inform their ideas \u2014 just as policymakers are supposed to do?\n\nFor most of the past decade or so, the Democratic Party has had a relative monopoly on a valuable political resource \u2014 expertise \u2014 as Republican politicians worked to discredit any independent source of accountability whose findings proved inconvenient to their agenda.\n\nIf the Congressional Budget Office said Obamacare repeal plans would leave more people uninsured, the CBO must be lying or wrong. If independent forecasters said tax cuts wouldn\u2019t pay for themselves, they must be biased or stupid. If scientists predicted that GOP policies would worsen climate change, those scientists must somehow be trying to make a quick buck.\n\nTrust us, Republican officials said: We know better than the experts.\n\nBy contrast, Democratic leadership \u2014 especially under Barack Obama \u2014 was pretty good about trying to achieve progressive goals in efficient, evidence-based ways. Rather than fiats, Democrats relied whenever possible on market-based mechanisms and tweaked incentives.\n\nExhibit A: the Affordable Care Act, which despite being branded as \u201csocialism\u201d was built upon market-based mechanisms. Exhibit B: efforts to put a price on carbon, rather than wishing away market realities through a vague and sometimes supposedly free Green New Deal.\n\nThere were of course political constraints upon what was possible, particularly since Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared that the Republicans\u2019 top goal was to make Obama a one-term president. They did this largely by sabotaging or obstructing Obama\u2019s proposals (revisit Exhibits A and B, respectively).\n\nThe more progressive wing of the Democratic Party watched all this in frustration and lashed out . . . at Democrats. Reliance on market-based mechanisms was craven \u201cneoliberalism.\u201d Clinton\u2019s fiscally responsible commitment to paying for her policies was a sign of political cowardice.\n\nDown with technocratic fixes to market failures, up with revolution!\n\nSo here we are. A significant contingent of the 2020 candidates is promoting bigger and bolder ideas \u2014 yes \u2014 but also worse ones. Ones that actual experts clearly played little to no role in crafting, because we know what experts have to say about them.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of proposals such as Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s (I-Vt.) idea for universal rent control, which would cap rent increases everywhere in the United States at 3 percent, or 1.5 times the rate of inflation (whichever is higher), regardless of local conditions. This idea seems almost designed to troll economists. Study after study of such policies finds that they result in less available housing, a worse housing stock, reduced mobility and a slate of other unintended consequences.\n\nOr consider Sanders\u2019s and Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-Mass.) dueling debt jubilee proposals, which would forgive student loans even for high-income Americans. As experts of varying political persuasions have pointed out, this would be a needlessly expensive giveaway to rich people. (Yes, high-income people have educational debt, too.)\n\nOr New York Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s (D) robot tax. In addition to being unworkable (What, uh, counts as a robot?), de Blasio\u2019s plan fundamentally misunderstands the connection between productivity increases and rising living standards and how such a tax would distort hiring.\n\nOr, more broadly, the wholesale rejection of any and all fiscal constraints, thanks to a politically convenient but crank economic theory known as \u201cmodern monetary theory.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fine, I suppose, for a primary to be about the policies Democrats wish they could enact that have little chance of making it through the Senate. Except the problem with these policies isn\u2019t just that they\u2019re politically infeasible. It\u2019s that they\u2019re bad. But anyone who points out any weaknesses is accused of not dreaming big enough or being a neoliberal shill.\n\nThe far left, in other words, has been taking a page from its opponents\u2019 playbook. Experts don\u2019t agree with us? Research, evidence and math prove inconvenient? Just trust us, they say. Our plans do everything we say they will.\n\nNow where have we heard that before?", "description": "They have big dreams, but the plans aren\u2019t backed up.", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Columnist Covering Economics", "Public Policy", "Politics", "September At Pm", "Catherine Rampell Is An Opinion Columnist At The Washington Post.
