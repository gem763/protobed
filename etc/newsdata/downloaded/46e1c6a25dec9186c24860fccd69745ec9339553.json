He was required to surrender passports and be kept under home detention with GPS monitoring, with departures limited to work, medical appointments and meetings with his lawyers.\n\nNeither defendant answered news reporters' questions as they left the courthouse with their lawyers.\n\nParnas and Fruman helped Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, seek potentially damaging information in Ukraine on the son of former vice president and 2020 presidential campaign rival Joe Biden.\n\nFruman was released from custody in Virginia on Wednesday night after he satisfied the $1 million bond requirement set when he and Parnas were arrested last week, Roos said. The bond was secured with his Sunny Isles, Florida condominium with an estimated value of more than $2 million. Like Kukushkin, Fruman is subject to home detention with GPS monitoring. He was also required to surrender his passports\n\nParnas remained jailed as of the time of Thursday's court hearing because he had not met his $1 million bond requirement, said Roos.\n\nOetken tentatively scheduled a Dec. 2nd status conference with all four defendants.\n\nImage shows campaign finance conspiracy suspect David Correia (left) leaving an arraignment hearing in Manhattan federal court in New York City with defense lawyer Jeffrey Marcus on October 17, 2019. More\n\nA federal indictment unsealed last week accuses the four of illegally funneling thousands of dollars in foreign money to U.S. candidates and committees in a conspiracy to buy influence and boost their business ventures.\n\nThe funding, some of it disguised through so-called straw donors, was aimed at boosting the campaigns of Trump-supporting candidates and political action committees, advancing the political interests of a Ukrainian government official and bankrolling a planned cannabis retail business.\n\nSome of the funds secretly came from a Russian businessman who is neither a U.S. citizen nor a legal permanent resident, the indictment alleged.\n\nCorreia, 44, is the only suspect who was born in the United States, the indictment said. Both Parnas and Kukushkin are 46-year-old U.S. citizens who were born in Ukraine, while Fruman, 53, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Belarus, the indictment said.", "description": "Two suspects in the conspiracy case that has ensnared associates of President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudolph Giuliani pleaded not guilty", "authors": ["Kevin Mccoy", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zvvKwaE0tbd63DYyWp5Lrw--~B/aD0zODEwO3c9NTcxNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/d95fb4c889800c63714e3b0c23401fd4", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
