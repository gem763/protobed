The company also depends heavily on Chinese moviegoers to buy tickets to its Marvel superhero movies. Avengers: Endgame grossed more than $614 million in China, or about 20% of the movie\u2019s worldwide box office haul.\n\nBut that relationship has grown increasingly thorny in recent weeks as protests in Hong Kong have focused worldwide media attention on American corporations that have cozied up to China\u2019s repressive Communist party.\n\nThe Disney-owned ESPN reportedly told its journalists to avoid talking about the NBA-China controversy, which erupted when the Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager expressed support for the Hong Kong protestors.\n\nIger only alluded to the China difficulties in his CNBC interview.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019ve learned if anything from what you just described, which is what happened with the NBA, is that any entity expressing anything in public today about something that is considered complex or controversial has to proceed with real caution,\u201d Iger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cautionary tale. And so I\u2019m going to be extremely cautious here in this interview and be careful with what I say.\u201d\n\nAhead of the Nov. 12 launch of Disney+, Disney CEO Bob Iger sits down with @JBoorstin to discuss streaming competition, China and Big Tech. pic.twitter.com/N1fEzJMDbl \u2014 CNBC (@CNBC) October 22, 2019\n\nBob Iger said that it\u2019s important for Disney to be \u201cculturally correct\u201d when it comes to China, though he didn\u2019t elaborate on what the term means.\n\n\u201cAt the Walt Disney Company, we infuse values in the stores that we tell. We design those stories, we tell those stories to be universal in appeal for an audience that is global in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we do that, we think very hard about being culturally relevant and culturally correct \u2014 much less so by the way than being politically correct. People always talk about political correctness. Being culturally correct has importance.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen we designed Shanghai Disneyland for instance, we talked about being authentically Disney but distinctly Chinese, which is essentially to be culturally correct and culturally relevant to the people in China.\u201d\n\nIger steered clear of specifics concerning Hong Kong or the NBA during the interview.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to weigh in very specifically about the events of the last few weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nIger has been making the media rounds recently to promote his new memoirs, The Ride of a Lifetime.\n\nThe 68-year-old Iger was once rumored as a possible Democratic candidate for president, but the entertainment mogul instead opted to stay on as head of Disney through 2021.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
