We're not going to hide anything,\" Gen. Javier Iturriaga told reporters.\n\nLater in the morning, the Interior Ministry's sub-secretary, Rodrigo Ubilla, declined to identify the 15 people killed since last Friday.\n\nIn a heated exchange with reporters, he said 11 people had died in arson attempts, looting and rioting in Santiago, and two people had died of gunshot wounds. Two others died in vehicle-related accidents, one outside Santiago and one further south, in the port city of Talcahuano, about 500 kilometres from Santiago.\n\nThe prosecutor said the vehicle-related case involved a 23-year-old man run over by a military truck.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada is warning Canadians to exercise a high degree of caution when travelling to Chile, because of the ongoing demonstrations and civil unrest. The department says Canadians are responsible for their own safety abroad.\n\nThe Chilean Institute for Human Rights said that by Monday night it had registered 84 people injured by firearms.\n\nAmnesty International on Tuesday said in an open letter to Pinera that it was concerned over human rights violations, and limitations imposed by the military during citywide evening lockdowns.\n\nWatch protesters clash with police in the streets of Chile's capital on Monday:\n\nTousands of protesters came out into the streets of Santiago and clashed with police in Plaza Italia with water cannons and tear gas used by authorities to disperse the crowds. 2:18\n\n\"The sole fact that some groups or people have committed acts of violence in a protest does not authorize security forces to dissolve them with the use of force,\" said Erika Guevara, director of Amnesty International Americas.\n\nUN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, called on Monday for independent investigations into the protest deaths, citing \"disturbing allegations\" of excessive use of force by security forces.\n\nBachelet made no explicit reference to her successor, Pinera, in her statement calling for immediate dialogue and a halt to \"inflammatory rhetoric\" that she warned could aggravate the situation.\n\nI\u2019m deeply disturbed and saddened to see violence, destruction, deaths & injuries in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Chile?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Chile</a>. I urge the Govt to work with all sectors to find solutions to address grievances and bring calm. I urge all planning to take part in protests to do so peacefully: <a href=\"https://t.co/XmDZUnAEK4\">https://t.co/XmDZUnAEK4</a> \u2014@mbachelet\n\n\"The authorities must act in strict accordance with international human rights standards, and any application of the state of emergency must be exceptional and rooted in law,\" Bachelet said.\n\nThe widespread protests sowed destruction across the city. Street cleaners and working parties of volunteers on Tuesday struggled to tidy and repair Santiago's central Plaza Italia, the focal point of much of the unrest, was littered with broken glass and stone, graffiti and still-smoldering fires.\n\nMany downtown streets still reeked of tear gas, and the majority of schools across the city remained closed on Tuesday.\n\nTraffic and public transportation were snarled across the city during the morning commute.\n\nA demonstrator waves a Chilean flag next to a fire as clashing with riot police during a protest on Monday in Santiago.

We don't earn much, just enough to pay our bus fare,\" she said. \"What we don't support is disorder, riots, looting. That doesn't help.\"\n\nThe protests were sparked by an increase in public transport fares in early October. But they reflect simmering anger over intense economic inequality in Chile, as well as costly health, education and pension systems seen by many as inadequate.\n\n\"This won't stop until people see real change,\" said Brandon Rodriguez, 25, a security guard. \"Governments of the left and right have come and gone ... but nothing changes for ordinary people.\"\n\nThe unrest has yet to impact copper output in Chile, the world's top producer, mining officials said.\n\nWorkers at BHP's Escondida copper mine, the world's largest, initiated a five-hour strike Tuesday morning, union officials said.\n\nAt Santiago's international airport, many passengers were stranded after hundreds of flights were cancelled by major airlines over several days and airlines laid out camp beds on the airport forecourt to accommodate them.\n\nA riot police water cannon sprays water towards demonstrators taking part in a protest against Chile's state economic model in Santiago.

They revolted to make their voice heard.\"", "description": "Chile's military said it would investigate allegations of human rights violations during days of riots, looting and protests that have left 15 dead and led to the arrest of more than 2,600.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5330166.1571743470!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1177498553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
