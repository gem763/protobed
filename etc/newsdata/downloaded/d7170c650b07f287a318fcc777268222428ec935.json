At first glance, the movie\u2019s log line sounds simple enough: a poor family goes to work for a rich family, in a drama about greed and wealth and class. But Bong Joon-ho has put together an intricate character study that mangles and mutates any expectations. Scenes are both hilarious and tragic, as Choi recounts, pathetic and gratifying. Choi plays Ki-woo, the son of the destitute Kim family, who hatches a plan to recruit his mother, father, and sister to pose as unrelated workers and infiltrate the home of the wealthy Park family. By the movie\u2019s devastating end, the Park home has become, at once, a vision of freedom and a pristine prison.\n\nWhen he was growing up in Vancouver, Choi says he wanted to become a theater director. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I could act, but my friend told me, \u2018Before you do directing, maybe you should try acting. It would be better for you. When you know how to act, it would help you be a better director.\u2019 So I was like, Oh, maybe, okay, maybe I\u2019ll try. I flew back to Korea to do an audition, and somehow I became an actor in one day.\u201d He no longer has ambitions to direct, but he does want to make the jump from the Korean cinema scene (where he\u2019s appeared in Set Me Free and Train to Busan) to Hollywood. In passing, I ask his favorite Hollywood actors, whose careers he\u2019d like to emulate. \u201cShia LaBeouf. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, oh my gosh, so good,\u201d he says. \u201cPaul Dano. Lucas Hedges.\u201d Knowingly or unknowingly, he\u2019s listed male actors known for sensitive performances, people who could easily be considered his peers after his performance in Parasite, an idea at which he blushes. Choi talked to Vulture about working with Bong, calling Kang-ho Song \u201cPapa,\u201d and if he thinks Ki-woo could buy back Parasite\u2019s house.\n\nI know you worked with director Bong on Okja, but how did Parasite happen?\n\nWhen I was shooting Okja, director Bong actually asked me to stay in shape. I was like, \u201cWhat, stay in shape?\u201d But he actually said stay skinny. So I was like, Oh, okay. Does he have work for me later on? But he didn\u2019t call me after that. It was like four months later that he\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, I was writing this script and I think you could play this role perfectly.\u201d He said, \u201cYour father\u2019s going to be Kang-ho Song and I can\u2019t tell you much more of it.\u201d At first I didn\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on, and I couldn\u2019t even read the script. I didn\u2019t know my name or the role. I had no idea what I\u2019d be playing. He gave me a script after that and it was amazing.\n\nDid you \u201cstay skinny,\u201d as he\u2019d asked?\n\nActually, I became skinnier than I should\u2019ve! I don\u2019t usually stay on diets, but I was a bit nervous about this role. So I think I became skinny naturally; I was just losing weight.\n\nWhat kinds of conversations did you have with him about Ki-woo, and how to bring him to life?\n\nI always had the question asking whether Ki-woo is a bright kid or dumb. Does he do good in school? He failed the university entrance exam four times. But director Bong said that Ki-woo is a really bright kid, but he doesn\u2019t do well on exams because he doesn\u2019t have any vigor. He knows that he needs vigor when taking a test. When he\u2019s tutoring Da-hye, he stresses that vigor is really important, but he lacks it. Director Bong told me, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s a really bright kid, but you don\u2019t have to act him like he\u2019s a genius or something.\u201d I don\u2019t know the specific word for it in English, but Ki-woo is very smart.\n\nThe most important stuff about Ki-woo was the close bond he had with his father. In Korea, there\u2019s this culture where young generations have to be really polite to the older generation, but that sometimes becomes very, really uncomfortable and sad because you always have to be polite. I had to break that.\n\nSure, it\u2019s hard to grow into yourself, to assert yourself, when you\u2019re trying to be polite and deferential.\n\nKang-ho Song, in Korea, is like top of the food chain. You have to be really polite to him, but that becomes sometimes really uncomfortable to him, and to me. I was being polite, but I actually tried to really get into character and be like a son in the mind-set, too. I always called him father, like \u201cpapa,\u201d in Korean. Everywhere I go, even off the camera, I\u2019ll be like, \u201cWell, Papa, did you have dinner?\u201d People are kind of surprised that I kept calling him papa after the movie. I still call him papa.\n\nThat\u2019s really sweet. Were there other things you and the rest of the Kims did as a family to bond?\n\nWhen I was shooting Okja, that was my first time actually seeing a trailer for actors. In the States actors get their own trailers, but in Korea all the actors group up in one room, and stay there together the whole day. We don\u2019t actually have to make time for bonding together because we always just eat together. We stayed in the same hotel for like two months.\n\nSo it just happened naturally. That makes things easy.\n\nYeah, like, after work we would just have a casual drink together, or if I have something on my mind or if I\u2019m worried about some scene, I would just tell them over dinner. \u201cPapa, this scene\u2019s kind of \u2026\u201d and I\u2019d get advice from him. I still get advice from him.\n\nWhich do you prefer? Having your own trailer, or staying with your cast?\n\nOn Okja, they actually gave me a trailer, too, but it was so uncomfortable and awkward. Just staying there doing nothing? I think I prefer being in the same room with everyone.\n\nDid director Bong show you any of the storyboards for Parasite? I saw a couple of them this morning, and they\u2019re kind of amazing.\n\nI think he actually had experience drawing comics! He draws really well, and he would draw our characters\u2019 emotions [in the storyboards] too. I think that helped us a lot, too. We didn\u2019t really have to rehearse, because when you look at the comics he tells you what to do, that\u2019s the direction.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes is when the Park family comes home unexpectedly, and the Kim family hides under that giant coffee table. That looked almost impossible to pull off.\n\nIt was really awkward and funny for us to be under there. But when they were acting on a sofa, we weren\u2019t there to watch them. They had really a minimum crew [for that sex scene] on that set without us. A funny thing about that \u2014 when we were shooting, we were acting very [much] in a comic way, but the cut in the movie came out really serious. At the time, though, we were holding laughs. We were being very drunk! We didn\u2019t know what to do!\n\nHow big was that coffee table?\n\nThey designed it for the movie; it was actually made for us. They measured up the table so four adults can fit under it. I thought it was a designer table, but they actually made it for the movie. I think it was half the size of this [hotel] room.\n\nAnd the house wasn\u2019t real, right?\n\nYes, every location on this film is a set. It\u2019s all built up. Even the semi\u2013basement apartment where the Kim family lives, it\u2019s a set, too. The Park family\u2019s house, it was actually made of two sets: the first floor and second floor were built at different places, and the basement was somewhere else, too.\n\nSomething I\u2019m really curious about is the importance of the stone that Ki-woo gets from his friend in the movie\u2019s first or second scene. What did you think it symbolized?\n\nKi-woo, as a character, kept on saying it was really metaphorical. There was a lot of conversations about that stone after the movie. Everyone was asking me like, \u201cOh, so what did that stone actually mean in the movie?\u201d But Bong didn\u2019t tell us that it means something. He just told me to take care of it.\n\nSo it was sort of up to you to decide what you wanted it to mean? To decide what Ki-woo wanted it to mean?\n\nYeah. And now that I think of it, when I was acting I thought it was a responsibility, like the heavy responsibility of Ki-woo\u2019s thoughts. It was his idea to go work for the Park family, right? So it was a really heavy responsibility for him to carry his family\u2019s future. But Cho Yeo-jeong, the Park wife, told me while we were shooting that she thought that the stone actually meant, like, an easy way to get to his life goals.\n\nSort of like a shortcut?\n\nYeah, shortcut. So then, at the end, when he puts the stone down on that mountain, it\u2019s his way of saying, Okay, no more shortcuts. I will try as hard as I can to make sure that I get the money to purchase that house. I liked that. What did you think that the stone was?\n\nI did think it meant responsibility, but I also saw it as him leaving behind his na\u00efvet\u00e9. When he puts the stone back, it\u2019s like he\u2019s putting away childish things, that he\u2019s ready to act more for his own interests and become more independent.\n\nCho Yeo-jeong thought about that, too, like, shortcuts were childish. Director Bong actually told me that it could be a gift because Min actually gave us that stone as a gift. I asked [Bong], \u201cWhen Ki-woo brought that stone to the basement, did he try to really kill Moon-kwang or Geun-sae?\u201d But he was like, \u201cNo, maybe it was a gift. Maybe he wanted to say sorry.\u201d That made sense to me. Ki-woo isn\u2019t a person who would kill someone. He would just go down there like, \u201cThis was a gift from my friend. I\u2019m really sorry about what\u2019s happened here. Here is my apology gift.\u201d Maybe it was a gift! [The stone] means a lot. It has a lot of meanings, I think.\n\nI love that reading of the scene, actually. Let me ask you this: Do you think Ki-woo saw anything in the Park family other than them being so wealthy? I don\u2019t think of him as being greedy or jealous, but I\u2019m just curious what you think drew him to them.\n\nI think Ki-woo\u2019s only goal was to carry his family. He needed money, and our family needed a job. I think they were just a method of getting money. I don\u2019t think he actually thought about it more than, you know, getting paid. I don\u2019t think the Kims are really ashamed of their poverty. We, as a family, are all so positive and we share a lot of thoughts together. We\u2019re a really happy family; we\u2019re just without money. Having money problems can make some families aggressive to each other, but the Kim family is really tight and happy together. I don\u2019t think he actually saw a difference between the Park family and Kim family, just that one had more money.\n\nI have to ask if you would actually read someone else\u2019s diary, as Ki-woo does in the movie.\n\nMy girlfriend\u2019s diary?\n\nSure. Would you ever read your girlfriend\u2019s diary?\n\nI don\u2019t know, maybe.\n\nYou don\u2019t know?!\n\nI kind of understand why he read it! He said he wanted to know her better, to know her deeper. So, yeah, maybe, if I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking.\n\nCan you tell me what you think of the ending? Do you think Ki-woo could earn enough money to buy that house?\n\nIt was really touching. Really sad, terrible. I felt so sad for Ki-woo. Do you know about that song that plays after the ending scroll?\n\nNo, tell me.\n\nI sing a song. There\u2019s a song that plays during the credits, and director Bong actually wrote the lyrics. The song is about how Ki-woo spent his days trying to earn money to purchase that house. It would take 564 years for Ki-woo to actually save up the money in order to buy that house. It\u2019s almost impossible for him to buy the house. When I first read it, I felt really sorry for Ki-woo, but I\u2019m pretty sure Ki-woo is one of those bright kids. He\u2019ll come up with some idea, and he would just go into the German family\u2019s house, and I think he will rescue his father.", "description": "One of the stars of Bong Joon-ho\u2019s new movie talks Hollywood, reading diaries, and the song that plays after Parasite\u2019s end credits. \u201cIt would take 564 years for Ki-woo to actually save up the money in order to buy that house.\u201d", "authors": ["Hunter Harris"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/08/08-choi-woo-shik-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
