A 3 percentage-point cut to VAT could deliver a boost worth up to 600 billion yuan ($90 billion) or 0.6 percent of GDP, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe move helps corporate profits at a time when the economy is facing pressure from the U.S. trade standoff and the impact of a domestic debt cleanup. Officials have increasingly turned to tax policy in their efforts to support growth, as debt-fueled spending and monetary policy become increasingly constrained.\n\nThe tax cut is also part of broader, more \u201cproactive\u201d fiscal support. The budget deficit target is said to be widened to 2.8 percent of GDP from 2.6 percent in 2018, and the quota for special bonds is said to be set to 2.15 trillion yuan, a significant rise from 1.35 trillion yuan in 2018.\n\nThe Finance Ministry didn\u2019t respond to faxed request for comment on the VAT reduction plans.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: John Liu in Beijing at jliu42@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net, Sharon Chen\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "China Plans $90 Billion Cut in VAT for Manufacturers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picdc208aa69a57736e2e4e675eb4ff7ddd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-04"}
