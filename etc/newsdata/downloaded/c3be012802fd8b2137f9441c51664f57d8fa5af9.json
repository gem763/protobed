As recently as this January, Kantor and Twohey write, she hadn\u2019t yet returned to her teaching job and was still getting death threats. Before going public with her accusations about Kavanaugh, Ford was a research psychologist, who \u201chad expected the next couple of months of her life would be filled with controversy, because of a paper she and her colleagues were about to publish about the antidepressant effects of the drug ketamine.\u201d She was a California surfer who found solace from the world\u2019s demands in the ocean, but a surfer whose father still played golf at a private club with Kavanaugh\u2019s dad.\n\nAt the start of the summer in 2018, Ford emailed a friend with whom she had once shared part of her story about Kavanaugh. \u201cThe favorite for SCOTUS is the jerk who assaulted me in high school,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s my age, so he\u2019ll be on the court for the rest of my life,\u201d and closed it with a sad emoji face. (Some of Ford\u2019s texts and emails during those tense weeks are quoted at length in She Said.) Through the next months, on the beaches of Santa Cruz, at her parents\u2019 summer home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Ford was making the decisions that would eventually take her story away from her.\n\nAs Kantor and Twohey detail, Ford was ambivalent right up to the night before giving her historic testimony at the Kavanaugh hearing. She underestimated how many people would find it meaningful or powerful. (Her husband predicted it would last one news cycle.) Her lawyers were stunned at how na\u00efve she seemed about all that would follow her coming forward. But what could have prepared her? Ford had donned a pink pussy hat in 2017 for a Women\u2019s March in San Jose, Kantor and Twohey write, \u201cbut she felt more invested in a separate march that year, to protest federal cuts to scientific research.\u201d Despite the right\u2019s bogeyman version of events or progressives\u2019 savior dreams, in no telling of her story is Ford some fearless feminist crusader. But then, no one is.\n\nThere are no grand, monumental gestures in the Ford story. Rather, it\u2019s the small-seeming acts and their persistent reinforcement from the people she chose to turn to\u2014her friends, a staffer for her state representative, then, later, her legal team\u2014that got Ford into that chair in Washington, D.C. They didn\u2019t retreat when she said she\u2019d rather not practice her answers to possible questions during the hearing. At the last minute, when Ford wasn\u2019t sure she could testify in front of cameras, one of her advisers took her aside. \u201cThe only way she could ensure that her account was communicated with accuracy and integrity was in a televised hearing,\u201d write Kantor and Twohey about Ford\u2019s last minute pep talk. \u201cThat\u2019s what Kavanaugh would be doing.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s unmediated retelling\u2014without a reporter as interpreter\u2014made her testimony all the more powerful, well beyond its already weighty role in deciding the future of the Supreme Court. In this, her method was far different from that of Kantor and Twohey, and the reporters acknowledge this. Their role is to gather evidence, they write, and what comes next is up to the movement. The authors note the women who lined the halls of Congress in support of Ford and who blocked its elevators and got dragged out of its hearings in protest. Some of them will be back on October 6, for an event called Reclaim the Court, coordinated by Demand Justice with the Women\u2019s March and The Center for Popular Democracy. These groups were among those to later demand House Democrats conduct the investigation of Kavanaugh he never got, and in August, members of the House Judiciary requested documents on Kavanaugh\u2019s prior political work during the George W. Bush administration.", "description": "\"She Said,\" a chronicle of the #MeToo era by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, reveals the power of women who, together, refused to stay silent.", "authors": ["Melissa Gira Grant"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/87b583d1b528ced823045f4cb12d939cb0be959c.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
