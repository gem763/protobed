Protests, including a \u201cNo Racists in Our Streets\" rally, were planned against a visit by the president, who has called the city the \u201cworst in the USA\u201d and a place \u201cno human being would want to live.\u201d\n\nEarlier, protesters placed a giant rat-shaped balloon with a Trump head near where the president would be stopping.\n\nNick Wass/AP\n\nTrump\u2019s feud with Baltimore was sparked \u2013 seemingly out of the blue \u2013 on Twitter in what appeared to be retaliation against investigations against him launched by the House Oversight Committee and its Democratic chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings. Cummings\u2019 district, which is mostly African American, covers part of Baltimore and is just a few blocks from where Trump is speaking.\n\nErin Scott/Reuters\n\nSince late July, the president has lobbed attacks against Cummings and the city of Baltimore, a city of over 600,000.\n\n\u201cRep, Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men & women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border, when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the Worst in the USA,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cAs proven last week during a Congressional tour, the Border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place.\u201d\n\nRep, Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men & women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border, when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous.

But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.\u201d\n\nMr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors.\n\n\n\nIt is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents. \u2014 Elijah E. Cummings (@RepCummings) July 27, 2019\n\nMaryland's GOP governor, Larry Hogan, called Trump\u2019s comments \u201c outrageous and inappropriate.\u201d\n\n\"Washington is just completely consumed with, with angry and divisive politics, the divisiveness and dysfunction. And then 14 hours later we get this tweet that sets off another fire storm of angry tweets back and forth.\"\n\nThe city of Baltimore has struggled for years with crime, poverty and issues with housing. In 2018, there were a record number of homicides in Baltimore, with 309 killed according to the Baltimore Police Department. But some have pointed to issues with developers and local landlords, including Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner whose family real estate firm owns apartments and townhomes in Baltimore. In 2017, the county reported some 200 code violations in apartments owned by the Kushner family in one year alone.\n\nTrump\u2019s only African American Cabinet member, Housing Secretary Ben Carson, is from Baltimore and acknowledged the city\u2019s problems.\n\n\"You know, it's sort of like if you have a patient who has cancer,\" Carson said of Baltimore. \"You can dress them up and put a nice suit on them, and you can try to ignore it. But that cancer is going to have a devastating effect. You have to be willing to address that issue if you're ever going to solve it.\"\n\nAt the beginning of August, Cummings invited Trump to come visit.\n\n\u201cI want President Trump to visit Baltimore,\u201d he said. \u201cMy God, I want him to come, I\u2019ll ride with him for hours if I have to.\u201d\n\nThe White House does not have any plans for the president to tour the city before or after his speaking engagement.\n\nABC News' Anne Flaherty contributed to this report.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Thursday headed to GOP retreat in Baltimore, a city he called a", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump-2-rt-er-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
