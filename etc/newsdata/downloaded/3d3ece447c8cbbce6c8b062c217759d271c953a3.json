To date, the film has only grossed $118.7 million worldwide\n\nTHR.com reported that the movie cost about $138 million to make and an additional $100 million was spent on marketing.\n\nHowever, Gemini Man was a box office bust when it opened in North America on October 11, debuting with just $20 million. It only grossed a paltry $8.5 million on its second weekend.\n\nBut there was optimism that the actor's fans in China would come out in droves to see the film when it opened there this weekend and offset the lack of ticket sales stateside.\n\nBut in a surprise turn of events, Gemini Man couldn't beat out Maleficent: Mistress of Evil and took in just $21 million behind Disney's Angelina Jolie starrer that opened with $22.4 million.\n\nThis brings its current global take to just $118.7 million.\n\nTwo for the money: In Gemini Man, Smith stars as an elite assassin who faces off against his younger self thanks to the use of groundbreaking de-aging effects\n\nLackluster: Smith promoted the film big time in Asia with hopes ticket sales there would offset the lack of them in North America. But it grossed only $21 million in China this weekend\n\nIn Gemini Man, Smith stars as an elite assassin who faces off against his younger self thanks to plenty of movie magic including groundbreaking de-aging effects and high frame rate technology designed for 3D screens.\n\nBut even two Smiths for the price of one clearly couldn't overcome the poor reviews the film received.\n\nStill, Smith can still take comfort in the huge success of Aladdin earlier this year.\n\nDisney's live action remake in which he starred as Genie was his best box office opening ever, raking in more than $1 billion worldwide.", "description": "Gemini Man is likely to bank a $75 million loss, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
