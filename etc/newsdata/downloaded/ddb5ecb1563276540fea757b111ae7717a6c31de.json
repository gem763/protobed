We have to work hard on technological sovereignty,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission president-elect, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cMargrethe Vestager will coordinate the whole agenda and be the commissioner for competition. She will work together with the internal market, innovation and youth, transport, health and justice.\u201d\n\nVestager\u2019s appointment sends a signal that the EU now wants to coordinate, or even merge, regulatory powers to bring previously distinct areas like competition and data protection under a single supervisor.\n\nAs Facebook moves into financial services with Libra, its digital currency, and Google branches out from search into hardware, the effort comes as part of worldwide push by agencies in Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere to figure out how to deal with tech companies that do not neatly fit into traditional categories of regulatory oversight established by policymakers.\n\nThe task of figuring out how to do that in the EU now falls to Vestager.\n\nBut while she accumulates new powers, her expanded role also is an acknowledgment that the current system has also failed.\n\nA small number digital giants remain the de facto digital gatekeepers for how Europeans and people around the world use online services. And despite years of investigations \u2014 many of them led by Vestager\u2019s own team \u2014 Google continues to dominate online search, Facebook remains the world\u2019s largest social network and Amazon continues to expand its online empire. Few, if any, have any real global competitors.\n\nVestager will now have to limit such tech dominance while also pushing Europe to be at the forefront of digital regulation at a time when the U.S. and several countries in Asia are starting to review their approach to regulation with an eye to joining up industrial policy, competition and consumer protection.\n\n\u201cWe have to update our regulation,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, a professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. \u201cWe have compartmentalized our society within different legal frameworks. But that\u2019s not how these companies operate.\u201d\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

This access to her own staff and resources, including the bloc\u2019s powerful and well-resourced competition authority, means that Vestager will have more power to direct policy than vice presidents in the previous Commission.\n\nBut the Danish politician is also walking into a political minefield.\n\nAs she takes up new roles overseeing digital and industrial policy, she faces questions about possible conflicts of interest because she will both be enforcing and setting the EU\u2019s standards \u2014 a concern that she acknowledged. \u201cWe cannot take any risks on the casework because it will have to stand up in court,\u201d Vestager said in response to questions about her independence.\n\nIn her new role, she will have to avoid overlapping with other commissioners, particularly Sylvie Goulard, the former deputy governor of France\u2019s central bank who was appointed as Europe\u2019s new internal markets commissioner with responsibility to promote digital industries.\n\nWith a remit to oversee regulation of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, Goulard will be in effect the region\u2019s digital commissioner with powers over new technologies like blockchain, data-hungry algorithms and the latest mobile networks, known as 5G. It remains to be seen exactly how the French official and Vestager will divide their respective responsibilities.\n\nVestager also is an outspoken critic of how tech companies use people\u2019s personal data \u2014 an area that she has made a priority for Europe\u2019s competition authority after opening several investigations in recent months into whether such harvesting of data by Silicon Valley represents an antitrust concern.\n\nBut this focus on data protection could bring her into conflict with national privacy watchdogs, many of which have their own ongoing investigations into Big Tech.\n\nIt may also put Vestager at loggerheads with Didier Reynders, a former Belgian politician, who was given oversight of Europe\u2019s tough privacy standards, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, within the incoming Commission.\n\n\u201cI have no intention of even trying to do the work on myself, on the contrary,\u201d Vestager told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe task is to make a sufficiently strong team among commissioners to make sure we can make things happen.\u201d\n\nHow the Danish politician \u2014 one who has used selfies, popular culture references and high-profile interviews to boost her global profile \u2014 balances these competing, and often conflicting, interests will be key to whether she succeeds as the Commission\u2019s new vice president for digital.\n\nVestager was able to sidestep such challenges during her tenure as Europe\u2019s competition chief.\n\nNow the question is: can she do it again?\n\nThis report first appeared on politico.eu on Sept. 10, 2019.\n\n", "description": "The role is certain to put her back on a collision course with Silicon Valley\u2019s most powerful tech companies.", "authors": ["Mark Scott"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/84/5a/bd2fa7984bce9d8c4f077b53672d/190910-vestager-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
