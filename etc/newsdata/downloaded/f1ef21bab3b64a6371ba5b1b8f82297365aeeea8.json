While the BOJ is likely to refrain from adding further stimulus at the meeting, equity strategists have varying views on whether the central bank will adjust its ETF purchase program. The BOJ has a 6 trillion yen ($55 billion) annual target for its purchases of equity exchange-traded funds, and a goal of 90 billion yen for J-REITs\n\nThe central bank first announced in April that it may introduce a lending facility for its ETF buying program, which would temporarily lend ETFs to market participants\n\nOn Wednesday, the Nikkei reported that the BOJ will start lending ETF shares as early as next spring\n\nIn a survey conducted by Bloomberg, 3 out of 45 economists said the BOJ\u2019s ETF target may be raised on Oct. 31\n\nREAD: Oct. 29, At BOJ Meeting, Bulls Eye Reasons to Shore Up on Bank Stocks Nomura (Yunosuke Ikeda) Nomura (Yunosuke Ikeda) Increase in ETF purchases seems less likely, analysts including Ikeda wrote in a note dated Sept. 30; Nomura confirmed the view on Oct. 23\n\nThere are issues such as BOJ\u2019s impact on market cap and trading value of some stocks, and difficulty to put forward a future exit policy for non-redeemable equity ETFs\n\nOne approach to minimize perception that lower rates will hurt bank stocks could be to further decrease the weighting of ETFs that track the This could keep in check the negative effects of additional easing and alleviate disadvantages for bank stocks, which are underweight in ETFs tracking Nikkei 225\n\n\u201cEven if the BOJ doesn\u2019t cut rates deeper into negative territory, there\u2019s a possibility they will adjust purchases of Nikkei 225-tracking ETFs,\u201d as purchases distort supply and demand, Ikeda said in an interview Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) MUFG Securities (Takeshi Yamaguchi) (NYSE: ) MUFG Securities (Takeshi Yamaguchi) Central bank standing pat \u201cwould leave an impression that the BOJ is already out of ammunition, unlike other central banks,\u201d economists including Yamaguchi wrote in an Oct. 23 note\n\nForecasts easing package to include 10bps cut in short-term policy and side effect countermeasures, as well as increase in ETF purchasing by 1t yen to 7t yen Nikko Asset Management (Koei Imai) Nikko Asset Management (Koei Imai) If the BOJ were to create a lending facility for its ETF buying program, liquidity in the market would increase, said Imai, head of Nikko Asset\u2019s ETF Center\n\nLending program would also help liquidity in the spot and options market\n\n\u201cMarket makers that borrow and then sell the ETF will have to turn to the spot market to assemble a package to return to the lender,\u201d he said. \u201cThis may mean that the spot market will also become more active with the lending program.\u201d Smartkarma (Travis Lundy) Smartkarma (Travis Lundy) \u201cThe BOJ\u2019s idea of lending ETFs is good if it increases liquidity\u201d\n\nRegarding the Nikkei report on a BOJ ETF lending plan, \u201cthe idea of lending decisions made once a month is less good.\u201d\n\n\u201cStock lending is a continuous market and ETF lending decisions should be of higher frequency than ETF creation/redemption calendar days, or it may make less sense.\u201d (Updates with Nikkei report and comment from Travis Lundy) (Updates with Nikkei report and comment from Travis Lundy)\n\nBOJ\u2019s Upcoming Decision Has Strategists Guessing on ETF Plan", "description": "BOJ\u2019s Upcoming Decision Has Strategists Guessing on ETF Plan", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic14008352e809c7476716abc2a6c3f4fc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
