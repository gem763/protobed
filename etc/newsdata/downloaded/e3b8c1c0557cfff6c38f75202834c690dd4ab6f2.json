Televisions displayed Hurricane Dorian newscasts and weather updates.\n\n\"We're the Hunkerdown Hideaway. It's what we do. We're the hurricane bar. Everything else is closed. It's a good opportunity for us,\" Northrup said.\n\n\"And it gives our regular customers a place to be while their houses are all boarded up \u2014 and get out of our caves for a little bit,\" she said.\n\nMonday update: Historic Hurricane Dorian batters Bahamas with 155 mph winds, stalls on way toward Florida\n\n'Rescue, recovery and prayer': Bahamas officials focus on as Hurricane Dorian slams islands\n\nCocoa Beach police ordered Hunkerdown Hideaway to close in 2017 amid Hurricane Irma's increasing gusts. A colorful component of Florida beach town culture, various watering holes along SR A1A pledged to remain open as long as possible as Dorian approached.\n\nThe effects of Hurricane Dorian were starting to be felt on the Space Coast with winds picking up and big surf. Hunkerdown Hideaway, a small beach bar near the end of Minutemen Causeway, known for staying open for locals who don't plan on evacuating, was starting to fill up with regulars Monday morning. More\n\nEffective at 8 a.m. Monday, Brevard County emergency officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for beachside residents, ranging from Kennedy Space Center southward to Sebastian Inlet. Merritt Island is included in this mix.\n\nHunkerdown Hideaway marked its ninth anniversary in August, and the bar's predecessors remained open during hurricanes.\n\n\"They have a room back there where I've spent three hurricanes. We'd bring mattresses up here. And they would say, 'OK, we can hang out together and we'll all be together.' It was a wonderful thing,\" recalled Cocoa Beach attorney Chris Holland, sitting in the bar Monday morning on a blue padded bench emblazoned with a red Cat 5 logo.\n\n\"You'd meet friends you never knew you had. And you'd meet neighbors that you never knew were important \u2014 but neighbors are always important,\" he said.\n\nHurricane Dorian cruise update: Extended vacation for some; delayed, canceled trips for others\n\nHolland said he planned to remain beachside during Dorian to help care for his 91-year-old neighbor.\n\n\"My favorite part of a hurricane is the camaraderie the day before. (Sunday) night, this place was so packed you couldn't even move,\" Holland said.\n\n\"You'd see friends you haven't seen since the last hurricane, or last Christmas Eve. This town is so different than anywhere I've ever lived,\" he said.\n\nBy 5 p.m. Monday, all essential Cocoa Beach city emergency personnel were scheduled to report to the fire station or the water reclamation facility for the duration of the storm. Police officers were expected to remain on patrol until road conditions become too unsafe.\n\nFollow Rick Neale on Twitter: @rickneale1\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Today: Hurricane Dorian: Florida 'hurricane bar' caters to those who stay", "description": "The Hunkerdown Hideaway calls itself \"the hurricane bar.\" There locals who aren't evacuating have gathered during major storms for years.", "authors": ["Rick Neale", "Florida Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/leAXYBwp0Vi4K2BSvL497A--~B/aD0yOTAyO3c9NDI1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/38b7ae6a579c02b77ab4035a20f08929"}
