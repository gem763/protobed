But several of the Tory hardliners \u2013 from Peter Bone to Andrew Bridgen \u2013 suggested they were likely to vote for the agreement.\n\nIt was not unanimous, however, as the European Research Group\u2019s steering committee, made up of senior MPs and former ministers, met on Thursday for a \u201cdeep discussion\u201d about the new agreement, which they went through line by line.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of mixed views. This vote will cause some agony for some members, but it will be up to each member\u2019s conscience,\u201d said a source.\n\nParticular sticking points included the role of the European courts of justice in solving disputes \u2013 \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be the supreme court?\u201d said one member \u2013 and the failure to give the DUP a veto.\n\n\u201cWe have stood with the DUP for so long that for some members it will be painful to choose,\u201d said another.\n\nBut even some of the most fervent Brexiters, including Steve Baker and Mark Francois, made positive noises about the settlement, saying there were \u201climited remaining concerns\u201d. Owen Paterson, the former Northern Ireland secretary and another hardliner, also did not rule out backing it.\n\nAnother hard Brexiter, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said: \u201cIt looks very much better than [Theresa] May\u2019s deal, but I am going to read the details very carefully before deciding.\u201d\n\nThe ERG will hold an emergency meeting on Saturday morning before going to the chamber for the vote.\n\nWith many of them considering backing the deal, there were signs of discontent on the other wing of the Tory party, among former remainers and softer Brexiters. Oliver Letwin, a former Conservative who lost the whip, said he would be voting for the \u201cadmirable\u201d deal, but also signed a letter, along with David Gauke, the former justice secretary, demanding to see an impact assessment first.\n\nSome of the other former Conservatives who lost the whip were anxious not to be rushed into voting for a hard deal without proper scrutiny. There were also worries that voting for a deal could open the door to the Eurosceptics backing out at a later date, when the withdrawal agreement returns for a second reading, to cause a no-deal crash-out on 31 October. To mitigate the risk of this, there was talk on Thursday night of a cross-party amendment to force Johnson into a Brexit extension if the withdrawal agreement bill was voted down at a later stage in order to wreck it.\n\nAt the same time, a number of pro-deal opposition MPs were agonising over whether to vote for the deal. Special advisers were tasked with contacting key Labour MPs on Thursday. Johnson himself is expected to begin calling round wavering ERG MPs and Labour MPs with large leave votes on Friday, Downing Street sources said.\n\nLabour MPs were coming under huge pressure from colleagues not to back a Johnson-led deal, but Ruth Smeeth, MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been quite clear publicly since April, I want to vote for a deal. It is my intention to vote for a deal unless [Johnson] has completely undermined workers\u2019 rights, environmental rights and consumer rights.\u201d\n\nBut there was silence from many of the other pro-deal opposition MPs, including those who signed a letter telling the EU they wanted to vote for an agreement, such as Stephen Kinnock and Sarah Champion.\n\nOne MP said: \u201cWhatever I say I will probably be met with a shower of abuse from one side or the other. I\u2019m still undecided whether to support the deal, which in many ways is less attractive than Theresa May\u2019s deal, but I have to think of the counterfactual, which is dangerous and risky.\u201d\n\nJim Fitzpatrick, the Labour MP for Limehouse and Poplar, said he voted for May\u2019s deal and he would do the same with Johnson\u2019s agreement, but he said many of his colleagues had not decided. He said up to 20 Labour MPs could back a deal but said the fact it was Johnson made it harder to vote for than an agreement put forward by May.\n\nThe only firm Labour switcher was Ronnie Campbell, who previously abstained. He told talkRADIO: \u201cSomewhere along the line, MPs have got to say, \u2018Enough\u2019s enough.\u2019 Let\u2019s go for the deal, let\u2019s do it.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Spartans\u2019 had originally indicated they would follow DUP, but now several hardliners suggest they will back JohnsonAll the day\u2019s developments", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Rajeev Syal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/062ef20352a2ebbdbf318c2c99d0b2b2cb7af01e/2450_382_2374_1424/master/2374.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0998823a78133017e7696b7abb0f025e", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
