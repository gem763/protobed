especially if you have diarrhoea and vomiting or flu symptoms.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nEast Yorkshire\n\nDoctors have told patients that norovirus is currently \"doing the rounds\" in Hull and East Yorkshire, HullLive reported.\n\nPaula South, of the NHS East Riding of Yorkshire CCG, said: \"We would strongly urge anyone who thinks they may be infected to stay at home, so not to risk spreading the virus further.\"\n\nPeople in need of medical advice should call NHS 111 rather than visiting a GP, she added.\n\nAlmost 700 cases\n\nPublic Health England said there have been 696 laboratory reports of norovirus in England and Wales since early August.\n\nThat figure is slightly lower than the average of 703 for the same period in the previous five seasons (2014/15 to 2018/19).\n\nEight outbreaks of suspected norovirus occurred at hospitals in England in September, down from the average of 13.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Science Photo Library RF)\n\nSix led to a ward/bay closure or restrictions to admissions and three were confirmed as norovirus.\n\nData for October is not yet available.\n\nAs for the upcoming winter months, Public Health England said: \"It is not possible to predict how the current season will progress.\"\n\nNorovirus is known as the winter vomiting bug, but cases can occur at any time of the year.\n\nThe main symptoms are nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting, but people could also experience a fever, headaches or sore arms and leg.\n\nThe symptoms usually appear suddenly within a day or two of infection and people normally feel better within a day or two.\n\nHealth experts urge people to treat themselves at home and stay off school or work until the symptoms have stopped for two days.\n\nThe best way to stop the spread of the virus is frequent hand washing with soap and water.\n\nNorovirus spreads very easily through close contact with someone who has the bug, touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them and then putting your hands in your mouth, and eating food prepared or handled by someone who has the virus.", "description": "Medics are seeing more norovirus cases -
