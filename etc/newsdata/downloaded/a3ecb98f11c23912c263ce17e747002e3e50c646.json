Had the cruise lines simply followed proper safety guidelines for windows, this accident likely would never have happened.\u201d\n\nChloe had asked her grandfather to lift her up so she could \u201cbang on the glass\u201d in a window in the play area, the Associated Press previously reported.

He also says that Royal Caribbean has not given the family a chance to review any surveillance video that may show the incident.\n\nRoyal Caribbean did not immediately respond to TIME request for comment. Following Chloe\u2019s death in July, the company had released a statement saying, \u201cwe are deeply saddened by yesterday\u2019s tragic incident and our hearts go out to the family,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nChloe\u2019s parents spoke on NBC\u2019s TODAY Show after their daughter\u2019s death. Her mother, Kimberly Wiegand, defended Anello and said that he had never put her childrens\u2019 lives in danger. She also said that he was \u201cextremely hysterical\u201d after the accident. \u201cThe thing that he repeatedly told us is, \u2018I believed that there was glass.\u2019 He will cry over and over.\u201d Wiegand said.\n\nThe Wiegands said that their daughter was very loving, and that she enjoyed watching her brother play hockey and gardening with her mother.\n\n\u201cShe could get anybody to smile,\u201d Wiegand said.\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.", "description": "Puerto Rico officials have charged Salvatore Anello with negligent homicide in the death of Chloe Wiegand, his 18-month-old granddaughter.", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/chloe-weigand-death-royal-caribbean.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
