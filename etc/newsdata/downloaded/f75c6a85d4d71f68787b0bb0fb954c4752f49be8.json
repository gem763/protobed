House committees are trying to determine if Trump's call to the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, violated his oath of office by asking a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.\n\nPerry, who is on a trip to Dubai, told CNBC's Hadley Gamble on Saturday that he didn't think Trump would eventually face articles of impeachment.\n\n\"No, not at all. This is as a big a 'chasing the ghost' as I've seen before,\" said Perry.\n\n\"People so dislike this president in a political way that they will spend whatever it takes, even to the point of giving up their own reputations, to try to harm him,\" the energy secretary added.\n\nPerry said he has been in many meetings with Ukrainian officials and the real goal was always to try to give the country access to energy which didn't come from Russia.\n\nRudy Giuliani \u2014 the president's private attorney \u2014 has taken a lead role in communications with some officials in Ukraine. When asked if Giuliani had become a political liability to Trump, Perry said \"I don't know,\" before adding that it is often important to take advice from outside of political administrations.", "description": "Perry tells CNBC that President Trump won't face full impeachment proceedings.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106189810-1571407794974gettyimages-1154669655.jpeg?v=1572004996", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
