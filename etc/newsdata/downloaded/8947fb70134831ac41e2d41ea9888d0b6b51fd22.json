(Matt Rourke)\n\nLara Trump, President Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law and senior adviser to his reelection campaign, on Friday dismissed recent polls showing Trump trailing multiple Democratic candidates, suggesting voters are reluctant to tell pollsters they support the president.\n\n\u201cThis is the same thing we saw in 2016,\u201d Trump said during an appearance on Fox News. \u201cThe polls have never accurately reflected how people feel about this president, especially now. I think people are more afraid now to voice their support for President Trump than they were when he was just a candidate in 2016.\u201d\n\nShe did not elaborate on \u2014 and was not asked \u2014 why she thinks voters are fearful of voicing their support.\n\n[President Trump trails potential Democratic challengers in 2020 test]\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News survey released this week showed Trump trailing four Democratic candidates in hypothetical general-election matchups: former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.). Against South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Trump was numerically behind, but the gap was within the range of sampling error.\n\nThe gap against Biden was the largest, with the former vice president leading Trump 55 percent to 40 percent.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t put a lot of weight in those kind of polls,\u201d said Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump. She noted that most polls showed Democrat Hillary Clinton with a lead nationally before the 2016 election.\n\nPresident Trump has suggested a more nefarious reason for polls showing him trailing Democrats. In tweets after the Post-ABC poll was released, he accused the media without evidence of putting out false polls \u201cto build up their Democrat partners.\u201d\n\nDuring her Fox appearance, Lara Trump said the Trump campaign was not impressed by any of the 10 Democrats who appeared on the debate stage in Houston on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t see anyone that worries us at the Trump campaign,\u201d she said.", "description": "The president\u2019s daughter-in-law and senior adviser to his reelection campaign dismissed recent polls showing Trump trailing multiple Democratic candidates.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/O8BMulyMcsQd_2UnuUfDIj9nc5Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FY6B2OFI5UI6TEQUERXFSTPF2U.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
