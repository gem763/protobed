(AP) - The husband of a \u201cReal Housewives of New Jersey\u201d cast member will have to remain in a Pennsylvania jail while he awaits a final decision on whether he will be deported.\n\nA judge denied a request Friday by Joe Giudice (joo-DEE\u2019-chay) to be released on bail.\n\nGiudice and his wife, Teresa, pleaded guilty in 2014 to financial fraud. Teresa Giudice served her sentence first and was released in December 2015.\n\nJoe Giudice has been held by immigration officials since he completed his 41-month prison term. A judge ruled in October that he would be deported to his native Italy upon completion of his prison sentence.\n\nGiudice has said he came to the U.S. as an infant and wasn\u2019t aware he wasn\u2019t an American citizen.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The husband of a \"Real Housewives of New Jersey\" cast member will have to remain in a Pennsylvania jail while he awaits a final decision on whether he will be deported.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/real_housewives_deportation_88639_c0-249-4072-2623_s1770x1032.jpg?5c0bfa3e51f9516951bea821b2604f67f345798c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
