Perhaps the best example was JFK\u2019s declaration that we would walk on the moon.\n\nMost of the time, though, it doesn\u2019t. Mostly because the statements sound good to a politicians base of supporters but rarely have any relationship to reality.\n\nTake, for example, Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call for taking AR-15s and AK-47s off the streets forever. The Associated Press decided to explore how difficult it would be to take the guns.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s recent vow to take away people\u2019s AR-15 and AK-47 rifles raised one big question: How is it possible to round up the millions of such guns that exist in the United States? The number of AR-15 and AK-47s in the U.S. is estimated at a staggering 16 million, creating logistical challenges to take them out of circulation. Many gun owners are also unwilling to turn over the weapons, and if the government offered to buy them all back at face value, the price tag could easily run into the billions of dollars.\n\nAnd that\u2019s if people are willing to sell them to the government regardless of price. Many gun owners have vowed not to sell them at any price, so the upside is that a mandatory buyback wouldn\u2019t cost the government close to that much, but only because so few would willingly do any such thing.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s pointed declaration during a recent debate \u2014 \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47\u201d \u2014 stoked longstanding fears among gun owners that Democrats are less interested in safety or finding a middle ground, and just want to confiscate guns. Even some gun-control advocates aren\u2019t so sure that confiscating firearms will work. \u201cIn some regards, this horse is out of the barn,\u201d said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and now the senior policy adviser for the Giffords group. \u201cFor years we\u2019ve allowed these to be sold.\u201d\n\nChipman is a favorite for journalists to talk to because his ATF background makes him appear to be something other than a gun-grabber. He\u2019s not, though. He\u2019s a gun control activist with a law-enforcement background and nothing more.\n\nEven Chipman admits that you\u2019re never going to get all these guns off the streets. He\u2019s realistic enough to know that no matter what you try, some of us will be holding onto our rifles, thank you very much.\n\nO\u2019Rourke believes that most people would follow the law and turn their weapons in under his proposal for a mandatory buyback program and assault weapons ban. He also wants to outlaw high-capacity magazines and expand background checks.\n\nO\u2019Rourke would do well to believe in unicorns and the Easter Bunny.\n\nMost AR-15 owners wouldn\u2019t do any such thing. Some might sell one back as a way of trying to make the government think they\u2019d complied, but they would boast five more at home. Those guns aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nDemocratic candidates pushing gun buybacks have also pointed to similar moves in Australia and New Zealand. However, the number of AR-style long guns in those countries pales in comparison to the United States, and neither has gun rights enshrined in their constitutions. Chipman believes an assault weapon ban should be handled similar to the machine gun rules, requiring they be registered and heavily regulated but not confiscated. \u201cI think it would be far more likely that we would find more of the weapons under comprehensive regulation by the government than sort of a forced buyback ban scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nTo be fair to Chipman, that would be far more practical, but it\u2019s still not going to happen.\n\nThe difference is that so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d are defined based on cosmetic features, rather than any inherent mechanisms within the gun. Machineguns are defined in a clear manner. If you can pull the trigger once and the weapon will fire more than once, it\u2019s a machinegun. That makes it easy to determine which guns qualify and which don\u2019t. It\u2019s a mechanical difference in the weapon.\n\nThe guns we\u2019re talking about here are functionally no different than other rifles that wouldn\u2019t be impacted by such a law.\n\nSo no, it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nIn the end, while the AP doesn\u2019t expressly say so, it seems they\u2019ve realized that Beto\u2019s plan isn\u2019t going to happen.\n\nOf the estimated 16 million AR-style guns that are in circulation, about half of them are owned by current or former members of the military or law enforcement, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Then, there are the logistics of actually getting millions of firearms handed over. Some law enforcement experts question whether a mass confiscation of firearms could be done effectively or safely. Even some self-identified liberals who own firearms question the legality of gun confiscation and even the practicality. \u201cConstitutional rights aren\u2019t based on what you like. What\u2019s the slippery slope of this?\u201d said Lara C. Smith, the national spokeswoman for the Liberal Gun Club, a nonprofit group of liberal gun owners. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to take away these rights, what other rights are they going to take away?\u201d\n\nPrecisely.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that gun confiscation of any kind is the predetermined \u201cline in the sand\u201d for many gun owners. Once that begins, all bets are off and many are ready to go to war. That alone should give everyone pause before they start this kind of nonsense.", "description": "While it's easy for Beto O'Rourke to spout off about how he's going to take the guns off the streets, is it really that easy to actually do?", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
