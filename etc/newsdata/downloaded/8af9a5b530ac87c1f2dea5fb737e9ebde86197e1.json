REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department said in a notice it was taking the action at the request of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to \u201cfurther the administration\u2019s policy of strengthening the economic consequences to the Cuban regime for its ongoing repression of the Cuban people and its support for Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe move will bar U.S. air carrier flights to any of the nine international airports in Cuba other than Havana and impact about 8 flights a day.\n\nThe prohibition does not impact charter flights. There are no foreign air carriers providing direct scheduled flights between the United States and Cuba.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in a tweet that his country strongly condemned the move and that it \u201cstrengthened restrictions on U.S. travel to Cuba and its citizens\u2019 freedoms.\u201d\n\nRodriguez said sanctions would not force Cuba to make concessions to U.S. demands.\n\nThese flights carry almost exclusively Cuban Americans visiting home at a time when the Trump administration has drastically reduced visas for Cubans visiting the United States. Some 500,000 Cuban Americans traveled to Cuba last year.\n\nThe new measure takes effect soon before Christmas and New Year\u2019s when Cuban Americans flock to the island for family reunions.\n\nFurther restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba would be aimed at squeezing the island economically and expanding Trump\u2019s steady rollback of the historic opening to Cuba by Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. The reversal, along with his pressure on Venezuela, has gone over well among Cuban Americans in South Florida, a key voting bloc in Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nUnder Obama, the United States reintroduced U.S. airline service to Cuba in 2016. Pompeo said on Twitter on Friday that \u201cthis action will prevent the Castro regime from profiting from U.S. air travel and using the revenues to repress the Cuban people.\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, JetBlue Airways Corp flies to three destinations in Cuba in addition to Havana from Fort Lauderdale \u2014 Camaguey, Holguin and Santa Clara \u2014 and American Airlines flies to five Cuban cities beyond Havana from Miami \u2014 Camaguey, Holguin, Santa Clara, Santiago de Cuba and Matanzas/Varadero.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it is \u201creviewing the announcement and \u201cwill continue to comply with federal law, work with the administration, and update our policies and procedures regarding travel to Cuba as necessary.\u201d\n\nJet Blue said it will \u201coperate in full compliance with the new policy concerning scheduled air service between the United States and Cuba. We are beginning to work with our various government and commercial partners to understand the full impact of this change on our customers and operations.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. government said on Friday it would bar U.S. airlines from flying to all destinations in Cuba besides Havana starting on Dec. 10 as the Trump administration boosts pressure on the Cuban government.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1445024963&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1T9", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
