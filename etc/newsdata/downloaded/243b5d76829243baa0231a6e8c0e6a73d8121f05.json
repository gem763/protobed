The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year\u2019s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world\u2019s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn\u2019t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t write \u2018paid ad\u2019 on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,\u201d Mr Weissman said. \u201cIf the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.\u201d\n\nAmazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the company said: \u201cEvery product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.\u201d\n\nGift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.\n\nWalmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its \u201cBuyer\u2019s Picks\u201d toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including \u201cTop Rated by Kids\u201d, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn\u2019t comment on \u201cBuyer\u2019s Picks\u201d.\n\nParents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets & More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they\u2019re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn\u2019t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren\u2019t confused.\n\nWhile federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can\u2019t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.\n\nThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.\n\nLists are a fast-growing part of Amazon\u2019s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nWhat sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.\n\nSimilar spots atop Walmart\u2019s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.\n\nPublic Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon\u2019s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn\u2019t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.\n\n\u201cWhen Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.\u201d\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Amazon.com has just released its annual Holiday Toy List, announcing that the toys, games and gifts for children on the list have been \u201cthoughtfully curated\u201d to help shoppers \u201cfind the perfect kids\u2019 gifts with just a few clicks\u201d.
