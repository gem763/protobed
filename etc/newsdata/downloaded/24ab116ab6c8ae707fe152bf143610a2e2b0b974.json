For better or worse, such a muted response could signal another turning point for the region.\n\n\u201cIt is enormous,\u201d said Gregory Gause, a scholar of the region at Texas A&M University. \u201cThis is the most serious challenge since the invasion of Kuwait to the status of the United States as a great power that would protect the free flow of energy from the region, and unless there is a big change in the response from the Trump administration I think Gulf leaders will start to question the value of that security commitment.\u201d\n\nConfounding expectations on all sides of the Persian Gulf, the attack and its aftermath have laid bare a cascade of revelations about the regional balance of power.\n\nThe stunning success of the attack has shown that billions of dollars in Saudi military spending has left the kingdom\u2019s central industry vulnerable, and it has demonstrated to the world that the increasing availability of low-flying cruise missiles and drones may have rendered many other defence systems perilously obsolete.\n\nIt has also shown the world a new side of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the hard-charging and often impulsive de facto ruler of the kingdom: He, too, has been forced in this case to back away from immediate retribution against his nemesis, Iran.\n\nIf Iran carried out the attack directly, as Washington and Riyadh say, then it has taken a brazen step beyond its familiar strategy of working through allied militant groups to strike at its foes, evidently surprising the White House.\n\nSeeking to exact a price from the United States for its sanctions on Iranian oil sales, Tehran may also now be emboldened to carry out further attacks, calculating that Trump will balk at another war in the region. The attack on Saudi Arabia was just the latest in a string of recent attacks carried out by Iran or a proxy \u2014 including attacks on oil tankers and the downing of an American drone \u2014 with little or no cost to Iran.\n\nAnd Trump, focused on his reelection, has so far shown himself less willing to match Iran\u2019s escalation than his ferocious tweets about \u201cobliteration\u201d and \u201cthe official end of Iran\u201d had suggested. He recently fired the adviser most hawkish on Iran, John Bolton, the former national security adviser. And instead of emphasising the traditional American interest in the free flow of oil, he appears to have returned to a view he espoused before his election \u2014 \u201cSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars,\u201d as he wrote in a tweet in 2014.\n\nThat Iran would seek in some way to attack Saudi oil production, though, was hardly unexpected. Experts had predicted for months that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of sanctions against Iran\u2019s oil sales would drive it to lash out against the oil production of Saudi Arabia and the Arab Gulf States.\n\nThe rulers of those Arab states had previously accused President Barack Obama of trying to pull back from the American commitment to the region. They faulted him for negotiating a 2015 deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions without further constraining its military or other activities. And the Gulf leaders were outraged when Obama called off a planned strike against Syria, an Iranian ally, for using chemical weapons against civilians.\n\nNow some prominent voices in the Arab Gulf States accuse Trump of an even greater betrayal. \u201cTrump, in his response to Iran, is even worse than Obama,\u201d said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent political scientist in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nInstead of reversing the perceived pullback as Gulf leaders had expected, Abdulla argued, Trump let down his Arab partners by failing to respond more forcefully to Iranian aggressions.\n\nThe United States has said that Iran was behind naval mines that damaged five oil tankers in the Persian Gulf this spring, and in June Iran boasted of shooting down an American surveillance drone. Yet Trump did little in retaliation for the tanker attacks and called off a planned airstrike against Iran in response to the downing of the drone.\n\n\u201cHis inaction gave a green light to this,\u201d Abdulla said. \u201cNow an Arab Gulf strategic partner has been massively attacked by Iran \u2014 which was provoked by Trump, not by us \u2014 and we hear Americans saying to us, you need to defend yourselves!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an utter failure and utter disappointment in this administration,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump has not ruled out a military strike, and senior national security officials met Thursday to refine a list of potential targets should Trump go that route. Still, he has made clear his opposition to another war, and has ordered new sanctions.\n\nBut Iran is already under acute economic pressure from the existing sanctions, which use the reach of the American financial system to try to choke off Iranian oil exports anywhere in the world. After pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal, the Trump administration implemented the sweeping new penalties this spring to try to force Iran to accept a more restrictive agreement.\n\nIranian leaders have denounced the sanctions as \u201ceconomic warfare,\u201d and they appear to have orchestrated an escalating series of attacks that threaten the flow of Persian Gulf oil in order to inflict some of the same pain on the United States and Washington\u2019s Arab allies.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians do feel cornered,\u201d Gause said, and that is why they appear to be taking more aggressive action than they have in the past. \u201cThis is an effort by Iran to break out of what they see as strangulation.\u201d\n\nDefending the administration\u2019s policies, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued this week that the sanctions may have limited Iran\u2019s ability to strike with even more sophisticated missiles or drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d have more complex ones but for the sanctions we put in place that have prevented them from getting access to money, most importantly, but also parts, spare parts, information technology,\u201d he told reporters on a trip to Saudi Arabia.\n\nIranian leaders have denied responsibility for the attack last weekend, but at the same time they have openly revelled in its success. It showed the United States \u201cthat playing with the lion\u2019s tail carries serious dangers and if they take action against Iran there will be no tomorrow for them,\u201d Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan of the elite Revolutionary Guard boasted Thursday, Iranian news media reported.\n\nThe Iranians may have previously worried about Trump\u2019s threatening tweets and hawkish advisers, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran scholar at Brookings Institution. \u201cBut now they see that he is not going to follow through on the bluff that he has carried out on behalf of the American people,\u201d she said.\n\nOthers analysts argued that the alarms from the Persian Gulf about an American retreat were overblown under Obama and remain so under Trump. American warships are patrolling the gulf to help protect tanker traffic. American satellite and surveillance drones patrol the skies. The many large US military bases deter invasions or other large-scale military actions.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s combination of tough threats and a weak response \u201cis the worst of both worlds,\u201d argued Jeremy Shapiro, research director of the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former State Department official in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cIt would be foolish to counter this escalation with an escalation, but it was foolish to get into this position in the first place,\u201d he argued, leaving the Trump administration \u201cto choose between an unwise escalation or a humiliating climb-down.\u201d\n\nExperts on military technology said Saudi Arabia should not be faulted for failing to stop the attack. Like those of other countries, Saudi Arabia\u2019s defences were designed to stop ballistic missiles. This attack appears to have been carried out with low-flying cruise missiles or drones that would escape detection by most radar systems.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that there is any country that could have defended any better than Saudi Arabia did, and that includes the United States,\u201d said Peter Roberts, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, an international research institute.\n\nYet the attack appears to have caused some rethinking by Crown Prince Mohammed.\n\nSoon after he was first named defence minister, in 2015, he plunged the kingdom into a military campaign in neighbouring Yemen to drive from power a faction backed by Iran. Saudi media outlets proclaimed that the prince was asserting the kingdom\u2019s power and leading a new drive to roll back Iranian influence.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians, they\u2019re the cause of problems in the Middle East, but they are not a big threat to Saudi Arabia,\u201d the prince boasted confidently to Time magazine in 2018. \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s economy is double the size of the Iranian economy,\u201d he said, adding that Iran\u2019s army was \u201c not among the top five\u201d in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWe will work so that the battle is for them in Iran, and not in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he promised on a Saudi news channel.\n\nYet the damage to the oil installation was a painful lesson in the potential costs of a wider conflict, at a time when the Saudi military remains bogged down in Yemen and Crown Prince Mohammed has been pushing for a public sale of the Saudi state oil company.\n\nThe Saudi decision to call for an international investigation and not immediate retribution may be the choice of a chastened prince, analysts said. \u201cI think there has a been a calculation that the costs might be too high,\u201d said Rebecca Wasser, a senior policy analyst at the RAND Corp.\n\nc.2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "Attack on Saudi Arabia tests US guarantee to defend Gulf", "authors": ["David D Kirkpatrick", "Ben Hubbard", "The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2019/09/20/us-mideast-security.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/US-MIDEAST-SECURITY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
