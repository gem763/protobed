Problem being that some players are finding that the Scrap Box is bugged in the worst way possible: they\u2019re losing everything they put into it.\n\nThere have been multiple reports over the past day, both on Reddit and the game\u2019s support forums, of paid subscribers putting loads of scrap into the box, going on with their game, accessing the box to get some of it back and finding it was all gone.\n\nWhile Bethesda investigates this\u2014they currently believe it\u2019s an interface issue\u2014current support advice is to \u201ctry opening another player\u2019s scrap box on a public server\u201d, which \u201cmay help in getting the items to show up again\u201d. And if that doesn\u2019t work, they\u2019re suggesting \u201crestarting the game client\u201d or \u201cuninstalling and reinstalling the game\u201d.\n\nThe bottomless, scrap-eating Scrap Box isn\u2019t the only busted introduction as part of Fallout First, either. The launch of private servers was meant to be one of the service\u2019s main draws, but they\u2019re not quite as private as many were hoping.\n\nInstead of being completely walled-off, invite-only servers, if you start a Fallout 76 private server anyone on your friends list can just walk right on in. For people who have done a lot of trading, friending someone only to swap some gear, that\u2019s...not ideal.\n\nA Bethesda rep told Polygon \u201cwe understand this is not what players expected for their Private Worlds\u201d, before adding \u201cWe are looking to provide an option in an upcoming patch that will allow Fallout 1st members to restrict access to their servers more completely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand this is not what players expected\u201d is a very good motto for Fallout 76.", "description": "Part of Fallout 76's controversial new paid subscription service Fallout First is the addition of an unlimited Scrap Box, which is somewhere players can store all of their junk.
