Producer Suzanne Niedland said Reynolds was working on a docuseries about his life shortly before his death. According to the outlet, the project is scheduled to be released in 2020.\n\n\u201cViewers will meet a man who\u2019s not only tough and funny but caring and vulnerable,\u201d said Niedland.\n\nBURT REYNOLDS' WHIRLWIND CAREER, FROM COLLEGE ATHLETE TO COUNTRY CROONER\n\nBack in June, Reynolds\u2019 business partner Gene Kennedy told Fox News the actor was like \u201ca grandfather figure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBurt was definitely a father figure, a grandfather figure to me,\u201d he explained. \u201cI mean, we were good friends, but over the times we had to travel together, I got to know him on a personal level. Very smart man, gave me a lot of wisdom and advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've got five grandchildren, and he was very active in their lives,\u201d continued Kennedy. \u201cWe did things together, sometimes with the children. And I think it made him happy and us, as well. My father passed away in '07, so we definitely hit it off in that regard. So he's been a big influence on my life. I definitely wouldn't be in some of the positions I've been lately without Mr. Reynolds. His participation in my life has changed it forever for me.\u201d\n\nKennedy said that despite his star-status, Reynolds was proud to call Florida home.\n\nSALLY FIELD REACTS TO BURT REYNOLDS' DEATH: 'HE WILL BE IN MY HISTORY AND MY HEART, FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE'\n\n\u201cHe loved California,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe definitely had a home here. But his true home was in Florida. His father was the police chief at Riviera Beach in Florida. When he was a young man, he wanted to go off to college in Florida. It was his home state, and he loved Florida very much. The Southern traditions and the beach and the coastal area of West Palm Beach and Jupiter, that was his home. That's where his roots were.\u201d\n\nKennedy said that Reynolds\u2019 death took him by surprise.\n\n\u201cWe actually did an event in August in Tennessee up in Knoxville,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I usually would fly with him to some of the events. We had a private plane scheduled to pick him up. But I had to remain behind to get some props and things moved with one of the trailers and I stayed behind. But I took Burt to the airport. We chatted a little bit on the way there. I drove him out on the tarmac and I helped him get on the plane. We hugged and I told him I love him. That was the last time I ever saw Burt \u2014 when he got on the plane. He passed away that September.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was tough,\u201d Kennedy continued. \u201cWe had an event scheduled in Las Vegas for late September or early October that we were preparing for. We were just in disbelief. I mean, he had just been to the doctor and got a clean bill of health. He was all set to go and [had] no issues. He was also studying for the Quentin Tarantino movie that's coming out next month, and I know he was reading for that. He had just actually come to LA the month prior, also, to read with Brad Pitt on that movie, as well.\n\nBURT REYNOLDS' SON QUINTON AND EX-WIFE LONI ANDERSON REACT TO HIS DEATH: WE'LL 'MISS HIM AND HIS GREAT LAUGH'\n\n\u201cAnd he was very excited about being able to do that. So it really took us all by surprise. I mean, I literally heard it on the radio and got a phone call from the family almost immediately when it happened. It took us all by surprise, and I had to pull over for a minute. I was actually on the interstate driving when I heard it, and I had to pull over for a second. I was in disbelief to what I had just heard... We all knew Burt was older. We all have our ailments, but nobody ever expected it because he was just so full of energy and so full of life. He was still doing his craft and staying busy working.\u201d\n\nReynold's Hollywood career skyrocketed in the \u201870s after his breakout film role as Lewis Medlock in 1972\u2019s \u201cDeliverance.\u201d The star went on to appear in nearly 200 films throughout his lifetime.\n\nHe received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of adult film director Jack Horner in 1997's \"Boogie Nights.\"\n\nIn 2010, Entertainment Tonight reported Reynolds underwent quintuple bypass surgery.\n\nFACEBOOK APOLOGIZES FOR REMOVING LATE BURT REYNOLDS' COSMO PHOTO, RESTORES IMAGE\n\nIn a statement at the time, Reynolds\u2019s rep Erik Kritzer said: \u201cMr. Reynolds has been released from a hospital in Florida in which he had a planned bypass operation.
