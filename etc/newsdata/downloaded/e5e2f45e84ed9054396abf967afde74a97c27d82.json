Biden was visibly upset over the weekend when Fox News\u2019 Peter Doocy asked him about his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nThe 2020 presidential hopeful bristled and demanded to be asked \u201cthe right questions\u201d while campaigning in Iowa.\n\n\u201cMr. Vice President, how many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?\u201d Mr. Doocy asked, a reference to allegations of profiteering in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump was also accused by a government whistleblower of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the matter.\n\n\u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Mr. Biden said Saturday, NewsBusters reported. \u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader? Trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that\u2019s what happened, that appears to be what happened, you should be looking at Trump. Trump\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum. And he\u2019s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me. \u2026 Everybody looked at this, and everybody\u2019s looked at it and said there\u2019s nothing there. Ask the right questions!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump defended his actions in a series of tweets over the weekend and into Monday morning.\n\n\u201cNow the Fake News Media says I \u2018pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him,\u2019 \u201d the president tweeted Sunday. \u201cThis supposedly comes from a so-called \u2018whistleblower\u2019 who they say doesn\u2019t even have a first-hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con. \u2026 The Ukrainian Government just said they weren\u2019t pressured at all during the \u2018nice\u2019 call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\u2019s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That\u2019s the real story!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very thing that they are accusing President Trump of doing (which I didn\u2019t do), was actually done by Joe Biden,\u201d the president added Monday. \u201cContinues to be a double standard. \u2026 These people are stone-cold crooked.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
