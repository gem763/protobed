There remains no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens.\n\nThe complaint also states that \u201cmultiple White House officials\u201d said a transcript of the call was stored in a computer system managed by the NSC Directorate for Intelligence Programs, which is \u201creserved for codeword-level intelligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to information I received from White House officials, some officials voiced concerns internally that this would be an abuse of the system and was not consistent with the responsibilities of the Directorate for Intelligence Programs,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2015 rather than national security sensitive \u2015 information.\u201d\n\nTexts released on Thursday and published by The Washington Post give further insight into the role of Giuliani, American diplomats and Zelensky aide Andrey Yermak in facilitating Trump\u2019s communication. In one message, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sonland mentioned NSC Senior Director Tim Morrison, though no specifics about Morrison\u2019s potential knowledge of the efforts are provided.", "description": "The president made the reported request as House lawmakers intensify their impeachment probe into his communications with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d98c5d4200000e2004d1fee.jpeg?cache=v79pjvjk0u&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
