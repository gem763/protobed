Took his try superbly and kept making metres from full-back.\n\nAnthony Watson 6\n\nProduced a couple of dynamic and forceful early runs, but had limited chances to cut loose. The game just didn\u2019t flow his way.\n\nManu Tuilagi 6.5\n\nGot away with a hit on the airborne Boffelli in the first half before his close-range blast created havoc and space for Ford\u2019s try.\n\nOwen Farrell 5.5\n\nMissed all four shots at goal before half-time. Not his most authoritative display when in possession. Was closed down effectively.\n\nJonny May 7\n\nRoutine finish for his try but missed a chance to put George away on the right wing soon after. Busy and threatening as always.\n\nElliot Daly scored his side's second try to help them move to three wins out of three in Pool C\n\nGeorge Ford 8.5\n\nOutstanding. Lovely assist for May\u2019s try and coped with heavy collisions. Some glorious tactical kicks and passing. Master conductor.\n\nBen Youngs 6.5\n\nVictim of a late hit by Matera which sparked a mass scrap early on. Showed alertness to take scoring chance. Mixed kicking.\n\nJoe Marler 7.5\n\nJustified another start \u2013 competing over the ball, carrying, tackling and antagonising in trademark fashion. Limped off after a strong shift.\n\nJamie George 7\n\nTook care of his basics \u2013 scrum and lineout \u2013 impressively. His performance mirrored that of his team; nothing flash, but dogged and efficient.\n\nKyle Sinckler 7\n\nUnder-pinned an often dominant scrum and once again demonstrated slick handling in attack. No solo breaks this time, but he\u2019ll be satisfied.\n\nBen Young's kicking was mixed but he was able to secure England's third try of the game\n\nMaro Itoje 7\n\nKept trying to dent Argentina\u2019s defence or their biggest carriers. One mega carry early in second half had fans chanting his name.\n\nGeorge Kruis 6.5\n\nRan an effective and productive lineout operation and was typically diligent in doing the unheralded work \u2013 hitting rucks and making tackles.\n\nTom Curry 8\n\nRemarkable work-rate and endless energy. Heavily involved throughout; as a carrier, in defence and as a lineout option. Hard grafting.\n\nBilly Vunipola 5.5\n\nManaged a few decent blasts in the first half but was well contained on the whole. Had treatment, then went off at half-time \u2013 worryingly. 5.5.\n\nSam Underhill 7\n\nNamed official Man of the Match. Less prominent than Curry in the first half but grew into the game and led the defensive efforts.\n\nGeorge Ford was pulling the strings and was rewarded with a hard earned second half try\n\nArgentina: E Boffelli 6; M Moroni 6.5, M Orlando 5, J De La Fuente 5.5, S Carreras 6; B Urdapilleta 4, T Cubelli 5; N Chaparro 6, J Montoya 6, J Figallo 5; G Pagadizaval 5, T Lavanini 2; P Matera (capt) 5, J Desio 6, M Kremer 7.", "description": "England secured a spot in the quarter finals of the Rugby World Cup with a comfortable victory over Argentina.
