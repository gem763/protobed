The Justice Department has not detailed any, and a spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the legal basis for this is,\u201d Brennan said, calling the probe \u201cbizarre.\u201d\n\nDuh, Brennan will call the probe bizarre. LOL\n\nGreg Brower, former assistant FBI director for congressional affairs and a former U.S. Attorney, said it\u2019s not normal for a U.S. Attorney to conduct an investigation without an FBI referral of criminal allegations. That\u2019s the role of inspector generals, he said.\n\nNone of this has been normal since 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to the point that it looks to be political and it\u2019s a bad thing for DOJ to appear to be doing something for political reasons,\u201d Brower said, adding that it appears that \u201cfor political purposes, the White House wants to be able to say through the election cycle that all of this is being investigated.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s political for Barr to investigate what looks like a political decision to investigate Trump.\n\nAlrighty then.\n\nJoe Scarborough seems to think Barr doing his job is somehow a bad thing though:\n\nThe investigation of William Barr after Donald Trump leaves the White House will unearth reamarkably damning material. He is foolishly acting like Trump will be president forever. He won\u2019t.\n\nIn fact, he will be voted out a year from now. Barr better lawyer up. https://t.co/FFQ0d28RG8 \u2014 Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) October 21, 2019\n\nIs this a threat? Because it sounds like a threat.\n\nAnd why would he lawyer up for doing his job?\n\nI have no proof of anything, but because I hate Trump, anybody working with him instead of against him, must be a criminal. \ud83d\ude44 https://t.co/hLbE3jiU7T \u2014 \u24bc (@TCC_Grouchy) October 21, 2019\n\nREEEEEEEEEEEE.\n\nWilliam Barr\u2019s \u201ccrime\u201d is investigating Democrats, including Obama. I guess he didn\u2019t get the memo. \u2014 Candy Lamb (@candylamb47) October 21, 2019\n\nThe nerve!\n\nSo many threats and ill wishes. @JoeNBC has been in meltdown mode for many months now. Whoever he talks about that serves' Trump is labelled by him as \"the most corrupt this or that in American history\". His inflationary boiling rhetoric is strange and irrational. Poor Joe. \u2014 Spinoza's rose (Hawkish Dove) (@Spinozasrose) October 21, 2019\n\nI'm pretty sure Barr said spying did occur. Dont tell me you wouldnt want to know that information. If it can happen to Trump and his people\u2026it sure as hell can happen to you, me and every American.
