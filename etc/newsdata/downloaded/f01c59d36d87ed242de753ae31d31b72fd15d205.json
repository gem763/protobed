It was reported just hours earlier that Ms. Roberts, 75, had died of complications from breast cancer.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump did not invent the concept of fake news,\u201d Ms. Malkin said. \u201cCokie Roberts, of course, passed away today, and God bless her for an incredible career that she had, but I distinctly remember that she was one of the first guilty culprits of fake news. In 1994\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, are we doing this today?\u201d Mr. Stelter interrupted.\n\n\u201cYes, yes we are,\u201d Ms. Malkin replied.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this today?\u201d Mr. Stelter asked again. \u201cYou\u2019re attacking her today? I just want to be clear. The body\u2019s not cold yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to hear what I have to say?\u201d Ms. Malkin responded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just curious,\u201d Mr. Stelter said. \u201cI\u2019m just curious if today\u2019s the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s pertinent to the discussion about fake news and media bias,\u201d Ms. Malkin continued.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d Mr. Stelter responded.\n\nMs. Malkin went on to cite a 1994 incident when Ms. Roberts covered then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s State of the Union address while standing in front of a simulation of the U.S. Capitol building. Ms. Roberts wore a coat and pretended she was reporting on the scene, Variety magazine reported at the time. She was later reprimanded by ABC News and issued an apology.\n\n\u201cThis was a deliberate attempt to deceive the viewing public into thinking she was actually there live covering it,\u201d Ms. Malkin added. \u201cFake news has existed far long before President Trump even had the idea of running for office.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
