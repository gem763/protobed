On Friday a coroner ruled he was misled into believing the burger was safe for him to eat because he had warned staff he was allergic to dairy products.\n\nHis family have called for a change in the law so all menu items are labelled with potential allergens \u2013 similar to \u201cNatasha\u2019s law\u201d which obliges food businesses to include full labelling on pre-packaged food. It was introduced after 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died from eating a Pret-a-Manger baguette that contained sesame seeds.\n\nBut Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, said a law change could have a serious impact on the viability of some of the 100,000 restaurants her organisation represents. \u201cHospitality and particularly high street restaurants are under intense cost pressures and are struggling,\u201d she said. We\u2019ve had a number of high-profile casualties on the high street. Those businesses operate on tight net profit margins. And there\u2019s no doubt some would not be able to cope with any significant change in their cost structure.\u201d\n\nLiving with a food allergy is difficult enough without restaurants making it worse | Sophia Ankel Read more\n\nRestaurants are already required by law to provide allergen information on request, Nicholls said, adding that the best way to prevent further tragedies would be better staff training. She fears menus could become overloaded with information and restaurants that changed menus daily, particularly small independent restaurants, would find it hard to comply.\n\n\u201cIngredient declarations on the menu isn\u2019t necessarily straightforward, and won\u2019t necessarily protect all of our customers,\u201d Nicholls said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keen to keep our customers safe, and do the right thing and that comes down to two-way communication. So much of this can be affected by the way in which a product is cooked or prepared, not just about the raw ingredients.\u201d\n\nCarey\u2019s family believe that relying on serving staff to communicate is not enough. Allergy sufferers say they are sometimes not believed by people, including chefs, that eating the wrong food could be life-threatening. Carey did tell serving staff about his allergies, Southwark coroners\u2019 court heard. The A-level student, from Crowborough, East Sussex, had been celebrating his 18th birthday with his girlfriend on a day out in London. The inquest heard that his chicken burger had been marinated in buttermilk, but the menu reassured him that it was safe to eat. Carey\u2019s sister, Emma Kocher, said outside court: \u201cIt is simply not good enough to have a policy which relies on verbal communication between the customer and their server, which often takes place in a busy, noisy restaurant where the turnover of staff is high and many of their customers are very young.\u201d\n\nNicholls acknowledged that arguments against putting full allergen information on menus were similar to those the food industry had made against Natasha\u2019s law, which ministers introduced earlier this month. From October 2021, sandwich shops and cafes will need to carry a full list of ingredients on pre-packed food.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be incredibly challenging for small coffee shops and sandwich shops,\u201d Nicholls said, adding that ministers had looked at extending the new legislation to cover restaurants and decided not to.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Natasha Ednan-Laperouse\u2019s death, after eating a baguette containing sesame seeds, led to the creation of \u2018Natasha\u2019s law\u2019 which will require all pre-packed food to be fully labelled with allergens by 2021.

Deaths are stable, we think it\u2019s around 10 to 20 a year, but we don\u2019t know because some allergy deaths are recorded as asthma induced anaphylaxis,\u201d Brocklehurst said, backing calls for a national register of anaphylactic deaths. Brocklehurst added that the government needs to reduce waiting times for people to see allergen consultants. \u201cIt\u2019s a postcode lottery. If you\u2019re in the south of England you\u2019ll likely be seen sooner than in the north and we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nThe Anaphylactic Campaign\u2019s helpline had been called recently by a man in his 50s who had suffered a bee sting.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an appointment until June of next year to see a specialist. That\u2019s an awful long time to wait for a referral. He doesn\u2019t know [if he\u2019s stung again] that he\u2019s just going to get a very itchy arm or if he\u2019s going to suffer anaphylactic shock. And he doesn\u2019t have access to adrenaline which is the safest drug available. And that\u2019s an awful thing for someone to go through.\u201d", "description": "Restaurant industry says change would be \u2018incredibly challenging\u2019", "authors": ["James Tapper"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cf914acf25632195cb76f5059be33416e557a67/0_177_1425_855/master/1425.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5119900c8932616ed01fc0d292a42c7c", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
