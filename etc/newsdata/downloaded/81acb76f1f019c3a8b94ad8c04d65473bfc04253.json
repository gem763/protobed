With only a few weeks left to live, the young woman starts making her final preparations in the coming episodes, and she bids farewell to those closest to her.\n\nSince learning that her cancer had returned, Sinead has done everything she can to enjoy what little time she\u2019s got left. She was further devastated in recent episodes when, after a visit to the oncologist, she learned that she only has a few weeks left to live \u2014 something which she later relayed to her friends and family during Ken\u2019s (William Roache) 80th birthday party.\n\nSinead\u2019s determined to spend as much time as possible with husband Daniel (Rob Mallard) and child Bertie, but her friends and family are also determined to lend a helping hand in making her short time all the more special in the coming episodes, as Coronation Street has revealed that Beth (Lisa George), Kirk (Andrew Whyment) and Craig (Colson Smith) will attempt to give Sinead one final Christmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Daniel insists Sinead is simply too ill for such a thing, but Sinead disagrees, thinking that it\u2019s the best idea ever. She\u2019s determined to enjoy what little time she\u2019s got left, but it seems as if Daniel\u2019s overprotectiveness could cause problems.\n\nAs a result, Daniel breaks down in the ginnel, where he\u2019s comforted by Bethany (Lucy Fallon). Matters are made worse, as Daniel returns home to find Sinead\u2019s read Bethany\u2019s short story \u2014 and now believes that Bethany is in love with him. Daniel insists that this simply isn\u2019t the case, but Sinead doesn\u2019t believe him.\n\nWill Daniel come clean?\n\nSinead\u2019s pleased when she wakes to hear her family arguing over silly things, while Adam (Sam Robertson) finds a drunk Daniel in the ginnel \u2014 will he able to make him see sense before it\u2019s too late?\n\nLater, the Barlow and Tinker clans congregate in The Rovers, and proceed to share their favourite memories of Sinead. They all smile fondly as they reminisce \u2014 that is, until Beth takes a call from Daniel.\n\nBut what does Daniel have to say?\n\nCoronation Street returns on Wednesday 16th October at 7:30pm and 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sinead's final days are almost here.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sinead-3894_1571045617.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
