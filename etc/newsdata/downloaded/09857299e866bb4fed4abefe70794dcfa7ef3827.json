(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)\n\nTHE KEY\n\nThe preliminary deal in Trump\u2019s trade war with China didn\u2019t loosen any of the tough restrictions on Huawei. And the delay is likely to make the battle over the telecom firm's future far more blistering.\n\nA decision on whether to lift the ban on American companies from supplying Huawei -- designed to help curtail Chinese spying -- is still up in the air. It wasn\u2019t part of the first-round trade deal, Trump trade adviser Robert Lighthizer said Friday.\n\nBut the stakes will be much higher when the ban is taking serious toll on Huawei\u2019s bottom line and China is fighting for the survival of one of its flagship companies. By kicking the can down the road on Huawei, it could be far tougher for the United States and China to reach consensus on tariffs, ways to protect intellectual property of American businesses, and all the other major issues left unaddressed in the mini-deal Trump brokered with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nHuawei is facing two deadlines next month that could prompt a make-or-break moment for the telecom giant that wants to dominate building the world\u2019s next-generation 5G wireless networks.\n\nFirst, the clock will run out Nov. 19 on the second of two 90-day reprieves that allow it to keep buying a limited number of U.S. products, forcing the company to shift to Chinese versions that analysts say aren\u2019t as good for running super-fast 5G equipment.\n\nThe Commerce Department has carved out some exceptions to that ban but hasn\u2019t announced them and could still reverse course, the New York Times\u2019s Ana Swanson reported.\n\nSecond, also in mid-November, Huawei probably will run out of other U.S. components that are vital for its 5G operations and that the company stockpiled before the ban hit, as my colleague Jeanne Whalen reported.\n\nOne big concern for Huawei is running out of technology from the San Jose company Xilinx, without which it will be a lot tougher for its customers to update their 5G software remotely, Jeanne reported.\n\nHuawei has consistently denied that it aids Chinese spying and said it would refuse any spying request.\n\nMeanwhile, pressure will also ratchet up on the Trump administration to refuse any concessions to Huawei.\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have savaged Trump\u2019s hints that he might roll back restrictions as part of a trade deal, arguing that he is gambling with national security, and lawmakers in the House and Senate have even introduced legislation that would block such a move.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) described the absence of Huawei concessions as the only good part of the preliminary trade agreement, which basically swapped a U.S. pledge not to raise tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods for China buying $50 billion in U.S. agricultural products.\n\n\u201cThe good in President Trump\u2019s \u2018deal\u2019 with China is not what\u2019s in it \u2014 there isn\u2019t much \u2014 but what isn\u2019t in it: any loosening of restrictions on Huawei,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nIn a tweet before details of the deal were public, Schumer said any Huawei concessions would show \u201ctremendous weakness.\u201d\n\nA China mini deal? It must not include concessions on Huawei. That\u2019s what China wants most, and it would show tremendous weakness.https://t.co/VE3HSTwlAz \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 11, 2019\n\nRep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) also railed against the idea of including Huawei in the deal, tweeting that \u201cOur national security shouldn\u2019t be up for negotiation with China.\u201d\n\nOur national security shouldn\u2019t be up for negotiation with #China. American companies shouldn\u2019t do business with #Huawei full stop. If we allow Huawei access to American data, that means the #CCP will have access to American data. That's unacceptable. https://t.co/YVv2zBA3fU \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) October 11, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, there could be some good news for Huawei hawks. A new nonpublic European Union analysis warns of serious security risks the company poses to 5G networks and that could steer some EU members away from the company, Anna Isaac and Parmy Olson of the Wall Street Journal report.\n\n\u201cThese vulnerabilities are not ones which can be remedied by making small technical changes, but are strategic and lasting in nature,\u201d a person familiar with the report told the Journal.\n\nU.S. officials have crisscrossed the globe urging allies to ban Huawei from their networks but with limited success. Only Japan, Australia and New Zealand have enacted full bans and even close allies such as England have previously suggested they\u2019ll allow Huawei to build some parts of their 5G networks.\n\nAn earlier EU report warned against relying too heavily on a single 5G supplier but stopped far short of calling out Huawei.\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPINGED: The resignation of acting Department of Homeland Security secretary Kevin McAleenan over reported conflicts with the White House will prolong a leadership crisis at the government's lead civilian cybersecurity agency.\n\nMcAleenan, who did not have a significant cybersecurity background, had been leading the agency since former DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April. He spent the greatest share of his time focused on immigration and border security, but spoke at a number of cybersecurity events recently and told reporters during a recent tour of DHS\u2019s cybersecurity innovation lab that cybersecurity was one of his top priorities.\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) slammed Trump for creating \u201cchaos\u201d at the department and urged the president to find a permanent secretary who will focus on top threats including \u201csecuring our elections.\u201d\n\nAmit Yoran, who used to run DHS's cybersecurity division, however, was skeptical that McAleenan\u2019s departure would harm the department\u2019s digital security mission.\n\n\u201cI think the department has a number of cyber leaders in [the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency] and elsewhere,\u201d he told me by email. \u201cI don\u2019t think that recent leadership changes will significantly distract or divert the cyber team from their cyber mission.\u201d\n\nKen Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is viewed as a potential replacement for McAleenan, my colleagues Josh Dawsey and Nick Miroff report.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. (Veronica G. Cardenas/Reuters)\n\nPATCHED: U.S. Customs and Border Protection will allow a contractor whose breach this summer exposed hundreds of gigabytes of classified documents to resume working with the agency after just three months of suspension, my colleague Drew Harwell reports.\n\nPerceptics must appoint an officer to oversee a number of security changes being mandated by CBP as part of the agreement, and pay for an independent monitor to evaluate its compliance with the changes. The company must also launch a tip line for employees to report potential violations.\n\nCBP called the breach, which included photos of travelers and license plates, \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d but not unethical or illegal, Drew reports.\n\nThe weak punishment highlights the problem of lax cybersecurity standards for government contractors that are collecting more and more highly sensitive information about U.S. citizens, Dave Maass, a researcher studying government surveillance for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Drew.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see agencies \u2014 when they find the technology they\u2019re dealing with is vulnerable, and that the contractors have acted irresponsibly \u2014 revisit not just who they\u2019re contracting with but how they use the technology in general. \u2026 Bigger and bigger breaches are going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nA hospital room is ready for the next patient. (Stock)\n\nPWNED: An Alabama hospital chain has resumed normal operations after paying the ransom demand of hackers who were holding its systems hostage, the Associated Press reports. The hospital revealed its decision in a news conference, a rare public admission that a company paid hackers' ransom demand.\n\n\u201cWe had to gain access to our system quickly and gain the information it was blocking,\u201d DCH Health System Chief Operating Officer Paul Betz told reporters. Betz did not disclose the sum the hospital paid, but said it was covered by insurance.\n\nThe FBI and other law enforcement agencies warn ransomware victims to not pay, saying it encourages further attacks. But failing to do so can lead to more costly recovery efforts. The city of Baltimore, for example, paid more than $18 million in recovery costs after refusing to pay a $76,000 ransom.\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\n\u2014 Cybersecurity news from the public sector:\n\nHouse to vote this month on legislation to combat foreign interference in elections The House will vote on legislation later this month aimed at limiting foreign interference in U.S. elections after a bipartisan report from the Senate Intelligence Committee this week called on Congress to take action on the issue.
