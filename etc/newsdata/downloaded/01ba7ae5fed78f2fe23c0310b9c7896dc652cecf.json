Here\u2019s What I Learned.", "language": "en", "text": "64 terrible fan bases go in \u2026 but only one will come out. Photo: Stevie Remsberg/Michelle Spies\n\nThis year, not unlike every year prior, was a big one for terrible fans. Furious Game of Thrones fans created a petition to have season eight remade \u201cwith competent writers,\u201d Louis C.K. fans fully supported his consequence-free comeback, and Friends fans went after a writer who dared to say the show is not good. That\u2019s just a tiny slice of the bustling, rabid fan activity of 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s rare, however, that we pit these fan groups against each other and think about why we dislike certain fandoms for certain reasons. After all, what could be so bothersome about people who like something (she writes, sarcastically setting up an article about terrible people)?\n\nLast year, with this in mind, I posted a casual tweet containing a bracket of 64 terrible fan bases, pitted against one another at last, because hating is my sport. I imagined that a few of my friends would interact and it would be a fun, stupid bit. But over 17,000 votes were cast. So, it turned out that people are very passionate about this subject, but no one else wanted to put in the work of creating and curating a tournament. Why not? (I\u2019ll get to that later.)\n\nIn the end, it was Elon Musk fans who took the tournament, but that seemed to be a very \u201cof the moment\u201d result. So, riding some momentum from last year, I decided to hold a 2019 tournament to determine the next worst fan base.\n\nWhat Does \u201cthe Worst\u201d Mean?\n\nAh, this question. Let me say this: You\u2019re overthinking it. This is an online joke tournament. It doesn\u2019t matter. I made it on Microsoft Word.\n\nWhen it comes to voting, \u201cworst\u201d was intentionally left nebulous because it means different things to different people. There is no rubric.\n\nOne\u2019s method of voting, I believe, should be left up to their own interpretation of \u201cworst.\u201d What do you find more insufferable: supporters of a famous abuser? Loud costumed hordes who crowd the subways? People who happen to be really into a thing you\u2019re positive is stupid?\n\nI encouraged people to just go with their gut when voting, because again, I refer you to the bottom line, which is that none of this means anything.\n\nEven though it was never explicitly stated, a lot of people seemed to assume that \u201cworst\u201d simply represented \u201ctoxic\u201d instead of just \u201cannoying as hell.\u201d This was not my objective, but if that informed the votes, then so be it.\n\nVoting was all done via Google Forms. Photo: Voting was all done via Google Forms.\n\nTeams in the Tournament\n\nAfter last year\u2019s terrible Star Wars Incident, in which I accidentally forgot to put Star Wars back into the bracket and everyone yelled at me, I resolved to *shudder* consult the public to make sure nothing huge was left out. This was obviously an insane and basically ineffectual thing to do, because most of the replies were nonsense things like \u201cbitcoin\u201d and \u201cthe Bible.\u201d\n\nA selection of the most popular nominations for the 2019 bracket.\n\nDid people still complain that their choice wasn\u2019t included? Come on, you know what a rhetorical question is.\n\nno homestuck? \u2014 ash (@slurpvlogs20) August 26, 2019\n\nI can\u2019t take any \u201cworst fanbase\u201d contest seriously that does not include Jordan Peterson \u2014 Richard Feren (@RichardFeren) August 27, 2019\n\nHow TF is Hanson not on here? \u2014 B. (@pickettbri) August 27, 2019\n\nThings I [explicitly] refused to include:\n\nCouple reminders:\n\n1. There was a submission form this year so if you're complaining now where where you when I RT'd that 10x and people unfollowed me\n\n2. As previously stated, politics and sports are omitted deliberately\n\n3. Last year's winner Elon Musk is also omitted deliberately \u2014 Michelle Spies (@spies_please) August 26, 2019\n\n\u2022 Sports (there are too many)\n\n\u2022 Politics and politically charged figures (let us hate something else about our fellow countrymen for once)\n\n\u2022 Diet and exercise trends (not really fandom)\n\n\u2022 Larger sociocultural trends (bitcoin, capitalism, etc.; not the time)\n\n\u2022 Elon Musk (last year\u2019s decisive winner was exempt this year)\n\nAbout the Fan Bases\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while some of these fandoms are almost entirely terrible, a lot of the contenders described below are just representative of the worst and most active members of the larger group. Tiers were assigned based on number of nominations and recent newsworthy events about the group or fans. Here\u2019s a little about who those fans are.\n\nTier One\n\nGame of Thrones: These fans are like Lord of the Rings fans but snobbier and more widely accepted because hey, they can afford HBO. GoT freaks got real mad this year about season eight\u2019s not meeting their impossible expectations, even going so far as to start a petition to remake season eight \u201cwith competent writers\u201d that received over 1.7 million signatures. Personally, I wanted them to take it all. What? This isn\u2019t real journalism; I don\u2019t have to be objective.\n\nBTS: There were a lot of rabid replies for BTS/K-pop last year (so it was either a genre or a group within a genre), and as the nomination form indicated, they\u2019d likely be a top contender.\n\nChapo Trap House: The eyes-always-rolled-back-in-their-head political-podcast-lover crowd. Hard-core regurgitators that claim to be sincere. Mob-mentality far-leftists who are for some reason proud of being extremely online and love \u201cWeird Twitter.\u201d\n\nPod Save America: The self-proclaimed politically savvy fans of this podcast run by former [all-male] Obama staffers would love to debate you, whether you asked for it or not.\n\nJoe Rogan: Rogan fans are the worst kind of men: toxic, childish conspiracy theorists, incels, and the like.\n\nPok\u00e9mon: A fan base easy to hate because it spans all ages and is painfully ubiquitous. Even though they\u2019re woefully attached to the simple video-game concept from the \u201990s, they continue to be dissatisfied with anything new Pok\u00e9mon tries out. While obsessive, they\u2019re primarily harmless when they\u2019re not chasing Articunos into traffic.\n\nStar Wars: LOOK, EVERYONE! HERE IT IS!! HERE\u2019S STAR WARS!! IT\u2019S IN HERE!! IN THE TOURNAMENT! Anyway, these fans are vicious bullies who seem to hate women, children, black people, Asian people, and the guy who made the thing they\u2019re fans of.\n\nTaylor Swift: Swifties have always been a staple of fan-hating culture. They\u2019ve been especially insufferable in the wake of newest album Lover\u2019s release.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9: The Beyhive is another staple. When Homecoming came out, no other topics of discussion were allowed.\n\nHarry Potter: To this group, Harry Potter is the literature gold standard. Everything that happens in the world begets an HP comparison. Interestingly enough, it spans many generations despite its release timeline, and a Potterhead is virtually impossible to avoid in almost any situation. It\u2019s one of the most pervasive pieces of pop culture in the past several decades, yet very few Potterheads seemed to have burnt out.\n\nStranger Things: This group of Netflix-show fanboys/girls who blow their loads for \u201980s nostalgia.\n\nSupernatural: Tumblr girls, etc. Lumped in with the Doctor Who and Sherlock fandoms. Probably going to be inconsolable when the show ends since it\u2019s been on since 2005.\n\n[Adult] Disney: Yeah, I get it, we\u2019re infantile freaks clinging to our youth. This group provoked discussion recently in the wake of an insane Facebook rant about how it\u2019s apparently \u201cweird\u201d for childless adults to enjoy Disney World. Whatever. I think it\u2019s normal and, in fact, cool. And yes, I was just there in January and I don\u2019t have kids and I CAN SLEEP IN ON WEEKENDS!!!\n\nMarvel: A pretty mainstream group of superhero lovers. Luckily for them, there is constantly a new thing for them to be mad about!!\n\nFortnite: Mostly teen boys who skip school to play Fortnite. Just annoying.\n\nAriana Grande: Look, Ari is amazing and a talented singer and all that, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily harass a writer who criticized her.\n\nTier Two\n\nBarstool Sports: Barstool Sports writers are notorious assholes, and their fans are the same but without the credits. They\u2019re also thieves who not only steal content but harass the people who call them out on it, and their toxic, fragile male fans are eager to do the same. Most recently the founder (illegally) threatened to fire any employees who unionize, then claimed that was \u201csatire.\u201d\n\nMBMBAM: I gotta be honest, I had never even heard of My Brother, My Brother and Me until the nomination form went out. Cursory research indicates the fans are white knights. It\u2019s an advice podcast.\n\nPewdiepie: The worst of gamer culture. There\u2019s likely something fundamentally wrong with your personality if you actively support an annoying-voiced Nazi-humor gamer. His fan base is literally called \u201cThe Bro Army.\u201d He has over 100 million YouTube subscribers, and his videos average 12 minutes. Just trying to wrap my head around the collective wasted time makes me nauseous.\n\nVoltron: Lots of calls for fans of this animated TV series last year too. And fair enough \u2014 there are many reasons to dislike them, namely, infighting and harassment of show creators.\n\nCardi B: Obsessive and addicted to the drama surrounding this rapper.\n\nD&D: Mostly harmless nerds who love role-play and are super into their fantasy game, but hey, this whole thing is about not liking people for your own reasons.\n\nKardashians/Jenners: The ravenous support of this group of people is responsible for that Forbes magazine cover that called Kylie Jenner a \u201cself-made billionaire.\u201d The kind of people who buy those \u201cEAT\u201d signs for their kitchen and Instagram their latte art.\n\nRick and Morty: To be honest, I did not expect or want to see this fan base in the tournament this year until the complaints about delays in new episodes arose. Rick and Morty is an amazing show doing great things for the late-night animation genre, but unfortunately you can\u2019t step into a single head shop without seeing 40 Pickle Rick bongs, and no one has forgotten the sauce incident.\n\nWWE: When I close my eyes and try to think of a WWE fan, I picture a long-haired white man drinking a flavored Mountain Dew in a cutoff. Generally loud and hateful fans.\n\nLouis C.K.: Mainly fragile men pushing back against #MeToo who continue to stan the comedian even after he\u2019s been outed for assault and harassment, claiming it \u201cdoesn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nXXXTentacion: Similarly to C.K. stans, XXXTentacion\u2019s fans adamantly deny that he beat his girlfriend and harass anyone who dares to question or put the rapper on blast in the wake of his tragic death.\n\nNicki Minaj: Fans of the famed rapper were definitely junior-high bullies.\n\nCoen brothers: The Big Lebowski is just okay, men! Yes, I said it!! I know the director pair haven\u2019t done much worth noting lately, but this is still true!\n\nThe Big Bang Theory: Personally, I don\u2019t think this show is still relevant, but I guess the judgment of the old people who watched it is evergreen.\n\nLogan Paul: Somehow a YouTube guy who makes jokes in a suicide forest has a lot of child fans.\n\nSteven Universe: Let\u2019s not forget fans of this animated show bullied a fan artist into attempting suicide.\n\nTier Three\n\nVeep: Upper-middle-class types who like to talk down to people. The many Emmy wins only reinforce feelings of superiority.\n\nChris Brown: How can anyone stan this guy after what he did to Rihanna?? Also, one time he punched a fan who tried to get into a photo of him with two women.\n\nSchitt\u2019s Creek: Even though they\u2019re generally good people, they\u2019re annoying. We get it, the show is amazing and sooo underrated.\n\nThe Bachelor[ette]: I don\u2019t really understand what it is about watching dumb hot people get drunk on TV that makes you want to send death threats, but okay.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog: For a fandom with the weirdest fan art, they sure got angry over the movie trailer.\n\nThe Office: Yes, The Office is a great show, but it also ended six years ago and the fans refuse to watch anything else.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race: Often racist and transphobic. Seems like they should find a new show maybe.\n\nMichael Jackson: Even if you haven\u2019t seen the eye-opening Leaving Neverland documentary, you gotta know you\u2019re stanning a pedophile.\n\nLizzo: I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s on the list. Lizzo is a good and still up-and-coming rapper-singer. Maybe it was the whole \u201cLizzo should play Ursula\u201d thing.\n\nRiverdale: I\u2019m not sure why Riverdale is on here either, aside from that it is a bad teen drama. I guess fans got pretty annoying about the rumors that Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart broke up.\n\nTarantino: Everyone\u2019s favorite N-word-using white director once defended Roman Polanski\u2019s rape of a 13-year-old girl!\n\nReal Housewives: While prevalent and annoying, this group has a lot of overlap with Kardashian/Jenner fans.\n\nShondaland: Mostly harmless, just obsessive. Seriously, how has Grey\u2019s Anatomy been on since 2005?\n\nOverwatch: I think the \u201cI\u2019m already Tracer\u201d thing really showed how annoying and/or misogynistic Overwatch players are.\n\nVeronica Mars: The show\u2019s rabid fans were not happy with season four and they let it show.\n\nRed Scare: This was another one I literally had not heard of, but it got a lot of nominations. It\u2019s described as a provocative leftist podcast that\u2019s Chapo-adjacent. \u201cDirtbag left,\u201d etc.\n\nTier Four\n\nJames Bond: Recently got angry about a black woman replacing Bond as 007.\n\nThe Simpsons: Yeah, we get it. \u201cClassic era,\u201d \u201cthe \u201990s,\u201d \u201ceverything in politics is like what happened on The Simpsons,\u201d blah blah blah.\n\nPhish: Does anyone else smell weed and unwashed clothing just reading the word \u201cPhish\u201d? The die-hard fans will attend, like, 15 five-hour concerts a year.\n\nFleabag: This one\u2019s probably on here due to recency bias, but these people love to praise Amazon\u2019s Fleabag as the highest art.\n\nDoctor Who: Obsessive nerds. Overlap with Supernatural fandom.\n\nComedy Bang! Bang!: To quote this Vulture article: \u201cComedy Bang! Bang! is the jam band of comedy.\u201d\n\nZack Snyder: Fans of the director forced a former DC exec to delete her Twitter and spent $20,000 on \u201cRelease the Snyder Cut\u201d billboards.\n\nLove Island: Personally I think the overlap between this group and Bachelor[ette] fans is 100 percent.\n\nFriends: Friends fanatics are probably on here for reasons similar to those of fans of The Office: refusing to move on and find a new show.\n\nThis Is Us: Obviously a low seed, but they think a show where Mandy Moore has fake wrinkles is sooo deep, so they\u2019re probably also people who celebrate their birthday month.\n\nUndertale: It\u2019s not news that Undertale fans are extremely toxic. It\u2019s just a game, guys.\n\nChrissy Teigen: I\u2019m not sure why people go absolutely gaga just because a model tweets jokes sometimes.\n\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: I don\u2019t know, they just seem like regular anime nerds, but there were a few nominations for this.\n\nCum Town: It\u2019s the dirtbag left. Similar group to Chapo Trap House and Red Scare.\n\nDrake: I mean, he just got a tattoo of himself walking ahead of the Beatles on Abbey Road \u2026 so.\n\nBoJack Horseman: Pretty much the same people who post about how depressed they are mostly for the social-media attention. It\u2019s a TV show, not poetry.\n\nRound One Matchups and Results\n\nGame of Thrones vs. BoJack Horseman\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Game of Thrones\n\nObviously Game of Thrones was destined to crush this round over the largely innocent but depressed BoJack Horseman fans.\n\nBarstool Sports vs. Michael Jackson\n\nWINNER: Barstool Sports\n\nI guess there\u2019s been more of a cooling-off period since the HBO Jackson documentary than there has been since the Barstool anti-union fallout.\n\nBTS vs. Chrissy Teigen\n\nWINNER: BTS\n\nNo surprises here. An easy win for BTS, probably because far fewer people are really gung ho for Chrissy.\n\nPod Save America vs. Tarantino\n\nWINNER: Pod Save America\n\nA 10 percent difference sends Pod Save America fans to the next round.\n\nUndertale vs. Riverdale\n\nWINNER: Riverdale\n\nRiverdale fans are easier to encounter.\n\nCoen brothers vs. Ariana Grande\n\nWINNER: Ariana Grande\n\nAside from Buster Scruggs, Coen-brothers fans lack relevancy.\n\nChris Brown vs. Rick and Morty\n\nWINNER: Chris Brown\n\nObviously a lot of people were going to be upset that Rick and Morty, last year\u2019s second-place winner, got bumped out before the round of 32, but you\u2019re comparing annoying fanboys to stans of an abuser.\n\nJames Bond vs. Cardi B\n\nWINNER: James Bond\n\nJames Bond fans just squeak by Cardi B. Sexism and racism ftw!\n\nFleabag vs. Pok\u00e9mon\n\nWINNER: Pok\u00e9mon\n\nI was pretty surprised that the race was this close. Pok\u00e9mon won by about 17 percent.\n\nLogan Paul vs. Schitt\u2019s Creek\n\nWINNER: Logan Paul\n\nThis was the most decisive victory of the round by far, as Schitt\u2019s Creek fans are harmless.\n\nReal Housewives vs. Beyonc\u00e9\n\nWINNER: Real Housewives\n\nI cannot believe the winner of this extremely close race! I was team Bey.\n\nCum Town vs. Steven Universe\n\nWINNER: Cum Town\n\nSomething of an upset here as Cum Town was a lower seed.\n\nD&D vs. Veep\n\nWINNER: D&D\n\nNeither group is really that awful when compared to others in the tournament, but clearly D&D strikes more of a nerve.\n\nStar Wars vs. This Is Us\n\nWINNER: Star Wars\n\nCome on. In what world where everyone harasses me for forgetting it last year would Star Wars not win?\n\nThe Big Bang Theory vs. The Office\n\nWINNER: The Big Bang Theory\n\nAgain, this seems to have played out more as distaste for the show itself than for the fans. My opinion.\n\nLove Island vs. Joe Rogan\n\nWINNER: Joe Rogan\n\nAnother pretty decisive victory for Rogan, who made it to last year\u2019s Elite Eight.\n\nChapo Trap House vs. Doctor Who\n\nWINNER: Doctor Who\n\nDespite a large amount of nominations, voters found Doctor Who\u2019s worse than Chapo fans.\n\nPewdiepie vs. Shondaland\n\nWINNER: Pewdiepie\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m surprised anyone voted for Shondaland when it was up against the Bro Army.\n\nHarry Potter vs. Drake\n\nWINNER: Harry Potter\n\nI\u2019m a Harry Potter fan who easily selected them over Drake fans. It was a pretty strong 23 percent victory for the Potters.\n\nRed Scare vs. Taylor Swift\n\nWINNER: Taylor Swift\n\nA surprisingly close race given that I had never heard of one of them, but Swifties came out on top here.\n\nKardashians/Jenners vs. The Simpsons\n\nWINNER: Kardashians/Jenners\n\nSimpsons fans are on the whole far quieter. You\u2019re definitely not seeing The Simpsons as top stories in every news outlet every day.\n\nMarvel vs. RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\n\nWINNER: Marvel\n\nMarvel dominated RuPaul by a 55 percent margin.\n\nPhish vs. XXXTentacion\n\nWINNER: XXXTentacion\n\nThe nature of XXXTentacion\u2019s defended crimes obviously outweighs anything a Phish fan has done.\n\nVeronica Mars vs. Nicki Minaj\n\nWINNER: Nicki Minaj\n\nVeronica Mars fans aren\u2019t even close to as aggressive.\n\nComedy Bang! Bang! vs. Disney\n\nWINNER: Disney\n\nThis result could not have been more obvious, and that\u2019s coming from an adult Disney person.\n\nSonic vs. Zack Snyder\n\nWINNER: Zack Snyder\n\nSonic fans are more just weirdos than jerks.\n\nMBMBAM vs. Supernatural\n\nWINNER: Supernatural\n\nSupernatural was a very strong competitor last year, and the Tumblr girls beat out the \u201cnice guys.\u201d\n\nLizzo vs. Voltron\n\nWINNER: Voltron\n\nVoltron\u2019s exclusion last year probably gave them more of an edge over Lizzo this year.\n\nThe Bachelor[ette] vs. WWE\n\nWINNER: The Bachelor[ette]\n\nEvidently, supporting contrived romances is less excusable than supporting fake wrestling.\n\nStranger Things vs. Friends\n\nWINNER: Friends\n\nEveryone would really like for Friends fans to move on!\n\nLouis C.K. vs. Overwatch\n\nWINNER: Louis C.K.\n\nThe abusers and predators seem to get more votes than the extremely online.\n\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure vs. Fortnite\n\nWINNER: Fortnite\n\n*Dab dab dab* That\u2019s a 63 percent victory for Fortnite.\n\nRound Two Matchups and Results\n\nGame of Thrones vs. Barstool Sports\n\nWINNER: Barstool Sports\n\nI was pretty sad to see Game of Thrones lose, but I get it.\n\nBTS vs. Pod Save America\n\nWINNER: BTS\n\nThis race was too close to call when I went to sleep, and when I woke up BTS had edged in front by just 2.6 percent.\n\nRiverdale vs. Ariana Grande\n\nWINNER: Ariana Grande\n\nThere probably is a decent amount of overlap here, but Ariana has way more fans to be annoying.\n\nChris Brown vs. James Bond\n\nWINNER: Chris Brown\n\nThis is a pretty obvious conclusion. James Bond never stood a chance.\n\nPok\u00e9mon vs. Logan Paul\n\nWINNER: Logan Paul\n\nLogan Paul is really crushing through this tournament. You\u2019d almost forget how annoying Pok\u00e9mon fans are.\n\nReal Housewives vs. Cum Town\n\nWINNER: Cum Town\n\nCum Town is now the last remaining podcast in the tournament!\n\nD&D vs. Star Wars\n\nWINNER: Star Wars\n\nFortune favors the racists and sexists!\n\nThe Big Bang Theory vs. Joe Rogan\n\nWINNER: Joe Rogan\n\nRogan is a top seed who\u2019s always hard to beat, but especially if you\u2019re just a Big Bang Theory fan.\n\nDoctor Who vs. Pewdiepie\n\nWINNER: Pewdiepie\n\nDoctor Who barely got by in the last round, and it stood no chance of defeating the Bro Army.\n\nHarry Potter vs. Taylor Swift\n\nWINNER: Harry Potter\n\nI thought this one could go either way, but the Harry Potter victory was more decisive than I\u2019d expected.\n\nKardashians/Jenners vs. Marvel\n\nWINNER: Marvel\n\nLevels of exposure to these groups are the same, so it\u2019s probably that the Marvel group contains more men.\n\nXXXTentacion vs. Nicki Minaj\n\nWINNER: XXXTentacion\n\nDefending an abuser is a trump card.\n\nDisney vs. Zack Snyder\n\nWINNER: Disney\n\nHmph. Whatever.\n\nSupernatural vs. Voltron\n\nWINNER: Supernatural\n\nVoltron\u2019s a little less relevant with the last season of Supernatural coming up.\n\nThe Bachelor[ette] vs. Friends\n\nWINNER: Friends\n\nFriends is crushing way more than I anticipated!\n\nLouis C.K. vs. Fortnite\n\nWINNER: Louis C.K.\n\nSexual predator vs. annoying teens.\n\nRound Three Matchups and Results\n\nAriana Grande vs. Chris Brown\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Chris Brown\n\nThis tournament is clearly leaning in favor of abusers and predators.\n\nBarstool Sports vs. BTS\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Barstool Sports\n\nToxic masculinity reigning supreme.\n\nDisney vs. Supernatural\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Disney\n\nA wider reach makes for a large defeat.\n\nFriends vs. Louis C.K.\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Louis C.K.\n\nSame reasoning as above. Annoying vs. predator stans.\n\nLogan Paul vs. Cum Town\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Logan Paul\n\nI\u2019m still surprised Cum Town made it this far, being as niche as it is.\n\nPewdiepie vs. Harry Potter\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Pewdiepie\n\nInspiring a shooting vs. inspiring a theme park?\n\nStar Wars vs. Joe Rogan\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Joe Rogan\n\nAll your bitching last year about Star Wars being omitted and it doesn\u2019t even make the Final Four. WOW.\n\nMarvel vs. XXXTentacion\n\n\ufeffWINNER: XXXTentacion\n\nActually a pretty close match here, but the abuser still wins.\n\nRound Four Matchups and Results\n\nBarstool Sports vs. Chris Brown\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Barstool Sports\n\nChris Brown was a front-runner in this tournament, but he can\u2019t beat the recency bias of Barstool.\n\nLogan Paul vs. Joe Rogan\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Logan Paul\n\nThis was such a close race!!! Logan Paul squeaked by by 1.2 percent. Could\u2019ve been anybody\u2019s game.\n\nPewdiepie vs. XXXTentacion\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Pewdiepie\n\nPewdiepie is a very strong contender to take it all. This was a decisive win.\n\nDisney vs. Louis C.K.\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Louis C.K.\n\nOnly predator apologists could defeat Adult Disney.\n\nFinal Four Matchups and Results\n\nBarstool Sports vs. Logan Paul\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Barstool Sports\n\nThough neither fandom is laudable, this result appears to be a \u201cBarstool fans are generally older and they should know better\u201d thing.\n\nPewdiepie vs. Louis C.K.\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Pewdiepie\n\nLouis has way less fans, and at the very least, less vocal fans.\n\nThe Championship\n\nHere it is. The final round.\n\nBarstool Sports vs. Pewdiepie\n\n\ufeffWINNER: Pewdiepie!!!!!\n\nPewdiepie was definitely winning, but I believe either Barstool or Pewdiepie fans got together to stack the ballot, since a lot of votes came in all at once for Pewdiepie overnight. This is what I get for not selecting the option that requires people to sign in with an email address out of RESPECT for your privacy!!! Anyway, the Bro Army clearly wins. DO NOT subscribe to Pewdiepie.\n\nTakeaways\n\nOn a surface level, the outcome of the tournament indicates that the lesson to be taken from it all is that the Bro Army is the worst of all the fandoms spanning music, film, television, podcasts, and gaming.\n\nDue to the nuanced nature of the tournament itself, however, I think there are several more important lessons to be gleaned from this little experiment.\n\n1. Running an online bracket tournament sucks.\n\nThis, to me, is the most important lesson of all. I would not recommend this experience to anyone. One out of ten stars (the 1 is because I gained some followers). This was hours\u2019 worth of free labor, and everyone got mad at me and took it too seriously. Some people got upset that I did not tailor a piece of online content to their exact preferences. Others pointed out my content simply did not meet their standards.\n\nAre seeds assigned accordingly because I have no problem with the submissions just the initial rankings of some \u2014 TroyD (@TroyD26962921) August 26, 2019\n\nHow are Berniebros missing from this list? \u2014 Sean \u2744\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83e\udd4b\ud83d\udeb2 (@oldJavaGuy) September 1, 2019\n\n2. All God\u2019s children are terrible.\n\nThe most important lesson to take away from all of this is that everyone is terrible. The fact that this tournament exists is not necessarily proof of that, since it\u2019s just some dumb thing I made on Microsoft Word to extend my own brand. The fact that there are at least 64 groups of people eligible for this tournament doesn\u2019t necessarily prove that either. But the fact that thousands of people were not only eager to engage in this game of disliking but also to chastise the person who made the game is proof that all God\u2019s children are terrible! That\u2019s kind of the point of this, if there is one! I guess!\n\nWhats the categories of worst??\n\nDo you know BTS fans do charities around the world??\n\nGo check out @OneInAnARMY \u2014 90g_twt (@90_twt) August 29, 2019\n\nBreaking: Pewdiepie fans devasted by the rejection from old white men! \u2014 Royal Bengal Human! \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\udde9 \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 (@MughalistB) September 2, 2019\n\n3. If you react with outrage to a joke tournament about bad fans, you are part of the problem.\n\nNo, you shouldn\u2019t necessarily be overjoyed to be considered the \u201cworst\u201d anything. But it doesn\u2019t really help your case to get upset about that. Generally, the responses weren\u2019t too angry and defensive. The most bitter and defensive replies didn\u2019t appear until the winner was announced. Pewd boys got mad then. Thousands of people participated in this poll, but obviously the replies were directed specifically at its creator.\n\nI hope all this was informative to you too. But it doesn\u2019t really matter. None of this does, especially since I\u2019ll probably end up doing this awful thing to myself all over again next year.", "description": "Comedian Michelle Spies recaps her 2019 online bracket tournament, in which she asked Twitter to vote for the worst fan base of the year.", "authors": ["Michelle Spies"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/23/fanbase-bracket/fanbase_bracket_04.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
