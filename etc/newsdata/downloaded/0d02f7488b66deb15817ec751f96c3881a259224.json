I resigned.\"\n\nKilmeade then said that Bolton had agreed to Kilmeade sharing the information on air.\n\nBolton also texted reporters at publications including The Washington Post and The New York Times with his version of events and hit back at the president's claim in a tweet.\n\n\"I offered to resign last night and President Trump said: 'Let's talk about it tomorrow,'\" Bolton tweeted.\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has opted to fire officials by tweet before they were able to announce their departure, with Bolton's ouster following those of former secretary of state Rex Tillerson and homeland security chief Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Trump had soured on Bolton after the hawkish adviser lobbied for preemptive military action against regimes in Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela.", "description": "\"Let's be clear.
