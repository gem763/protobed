REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nGermany\u2019s oldest party, divided over staying in conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition, is holding a protracted leadership race after its worst ever performance in elections to the European Parliament in May forced Andrea Nahles to quit.\n\nGerman media are already poking fun at the SPD\u2019s 23 regional conferences for the candidates in the next six weeks, describing the tour as a \u201cspeed-dating\u201d extravaganza.\n\nThe result of the conferences is due on Oct. 26 and if no candidate wins more than half the vote there will be a run-off. The new leader\u2019s formal election will be at the main party conference in December.\n\nThe pro-European party encouraged two candidates, preferably a man and a woman, to run on a joint ticket and stressed it wanted candidates from left to right.\n\nOnly one candidate is running alone. One pair dropped out immediately, leaving 15 candidates in the race.\n\nThe race looks fairly open. The highest profile candidate is Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who picked a relatively unknown female colleague from the former communist east, to run with. They are committed to the ruling coalition.\n\nScholz called for a wealth tax on the super rich, adding: \u201cWe must also cut taxes for those on lower incomes, for those who earn a normal wage.\u201d\n\nJust off all time lows, the SPD is languishing in polls at around 14%, way below Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the Greens.\n\nMany members are fed up with their party propping up Merkel, who has led Europe\u2019s biggest economy for the last 14 years - 10 of which have been with the SPD. They want the party to reinvent themselves in opposition.\n\n\u201cDAMNED DANGEROUS TIMES\u201d\n\nOther leadership contenders include European Affairs Minister Michael Roth and a female partner, and left winger Ralf Stegner, one of the party\u2019s deputy leaders, who is running with former candidate for German president Gesine Schwan.\n\nBoth Scholz and Roth said the SPD was the party in Germany best placed to hold together the EU in an uncertain world.\n\n\u201cThis SPD is the Europe party,\u201d Roth told the first hustings in Saarbruecken. \u201cWe\u2019re living in damned dangerous times. Democracy is under pressure. Authoritarianism is growing ... Our answer to Donald Trump is the United States of Europe.\u201d\n\nScholz added: \u201cOnly a strong social state and a strong Europe and a strong Social Democratic Party can ensure that the world doesn\u2019t drift apart and that we stick together.\u201d\n\nThe SPD pursued a policy of \u201cOstpolitik\u201d rapprochement with the Soviet bloc during the Cold War before reforming Germany\u2019s labour market under Gerhard Schroeder, Merkel\u2019s predecessor.\n\nWhile in coalition with Merkel, the party has struggled to distinguish itself from her conservatives, resulting in a loss of support and an existential crisis.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nAlso running for leader are Boris Pistorius, a minister in the Lower Saxony regional government, and Norbert Walter-Borjans, a former finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia known for pursuing tax evaders with Swiss bank accounts.\n\nThe SPD is to review its role in government by the end of the year.\n\nThe party got something of a reprieve when it managed to remain the biggest party in an election in the eastern state of Brandenburg on Sunday, although it bled votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Greens.", "description": "No fewer than 17 leadership candidates for Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) faced hustings on Wednesday with members deciding who they want to drag the party out of the doldrums and decide whether to quit government.", "authors": ["Madeline Chambers", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426247079&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831WD"}
