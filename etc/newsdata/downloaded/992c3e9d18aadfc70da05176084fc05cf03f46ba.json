Lee Charnley (managing director) will be on with that, but we\u2019ll do our utmost to make sure we don\u2019t lose our best young players.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be all out to get that tied up \u2013 and his brother, which is vitally important. There are one or two that are in discussions with the club, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll move that on in the next week or two.\u2019\n\nSean, 21, signed a new deal last December, one month before he broke into the first team. However, progress on a new six-year contract has stalled and Manchester United retain an interest in the midfielder.\n\nMatty and brother Sean discuss victory over Manchester United at St James' Park\n\nThe brothers will start at Chelsea on Saturday after Bruce confirmed that Matty has retained his place.\n\n\u2018How could I leave him out?\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018You can imagine what the kid\u2019s been like (the past fortnight), he\u2019s been like a kid in a sweet shop.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been quite refreshing for all of us to witness the TV interview (after his debut). He beamed out of the television. It brought a refreshing humility to us all and it was a wonderful debut for the kid.\n\nBruce says Longstaff has been 'like a kid in a sweet shop' since opening his Newcastle account\n\n\u2018We have to protect him and nurture him along the way because he\u2019s got a big future ahead of him. He\u2019s got to handle all that comes. Hopefully, we can help him in that respect.\n\n\u2018But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve witnessed as a good a debut. It wasn\u2019t just the goal, that capped it too, it was the way he played in the whole game. It was terrific.\n\n\u2018From day one, he\u2019s been knocking on the door. It was always a case of when do I put him in. The circumstances were right. Since I joined up with the squad in China, he\u2019s the one that\u2019s constantly performed well in training and his enthusiasm is there for everybody to see.\u2019", "description": "Steve Bruce says Newcastle United will be doing their utmost to make sure they do not lose Matty Longstaff at the end of this season.
