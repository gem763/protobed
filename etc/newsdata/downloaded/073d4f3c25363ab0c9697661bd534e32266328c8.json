It\u2019s an unprecedented amount during a growing economy, leaving little room to maneuver if the economy stumbles, experts warn.\n\nLeaders are \u201cignoring trillions of dollars in shortfalls for Social Security, Medicare and other programs that many millions of Americans rely upon\u201d amid an unsustainable sea of red ink, charged Republican Mitch Daniels, former Indiana governor and co-chair of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n\u201cWe are at a turning point \u2015 without action now to phase in reforms over the coming years, Americans will face a much different future than the one that was promised,\u201d Daniels said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump vowed during his campaign to eliminate the deficit in eight years. But instead, his massive corporate tax cut and unchecked spending has boosted the deficit 50% while he has been in office to nearly $1 trillion. It grew $205 billion, or 26%, in the last year.\n\nThe government spent close to $380 billion in interest payments alone on its debt last year, nearly equal to its contribution to Medicaid, according to The Washington Post.\n\nRepublicans have traditionally pressed for balanced budgets. The GOP-dominated House in 2011 even pushed to pass a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget, the Post noted. But GOP lawmakers have dropped their opposition to an exploding deficit now that it\u2019s being driven by a Republican president.\n\nDeficits traditionally run high when the economy is faltering, not when it\u2019s growing.\n\nAn overwhelming deficit during a long span of economic growth \u201cshows just how reckless our leaders have become,\u201d charged Democrat Leon Panetta, former CIA and Office of Management and Budget director under Barack Obama, and co-chair of the CRFB.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the time when deficits should be contracting, not expanding,\u201d Panetta added. Instead, leaders \u201ccontinue to binge on debt-fueled tax cuts and spending hikes.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects that the deficit could reach $1 trillion within this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.", "description": "\"We are at a turning point\" as Americans' future threatens to change for the worse, warns one Republican critic.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db3c2102000009228506d4c.jpeg?cache=0o0avuzgua&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
