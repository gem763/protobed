As of the time of writing this, the cryptocurrency is trading at $8,230, which is a price that implies BTC is down a mere 0.18% in the past 24 hours (as of the time of writing this piece).\n\nWhile some analysts are expecting this non-action \u2014 sub-3% moves each and every day, for weeks on end \u2014 to continue well into November, analysts claim that it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin breaks out. Hard.\n\nBitcoin Price Volatility Inbound?\n\nPopular cryptocurrency trader Josh Rager recently noted that the Bollinger Bands, a popular technical analysis tool used to determine rough trading zones for assets, have begun to pinch tighter on Bitcoin\u2019s one-day chart. He quipped that previous pinching/converging BBands \u201cled to moves to high volatility and strong price action.\u201d\n\nBbands pinching here, could only be a matter of days until the next volatile move pic.twitter.com/9qOk8LvzTb \u2014 Josh Rager \ud83d\udcc8 (@Josh_Rager) October 21, 2019\n\nJosh Rager isn\u2019t the only one expecting for volatility to soon return to the Bitcoin markets. Bloomberg reported Monday that \u201cone technical gauge is showing dramatic price swings for the digital token may be primed for a return.\u201d\n\nThe indicator the outlet was taking into account with this analysis is the Trading Envelope indicator, which uses moving averages to map out estimated ranges for assets \u2014 much like, if not nearly identical to the Bollinger Bands that Rager drew attention to:\n\n\u201c[The indicator is] at its narrowest since mid-September\u2026 A similar narrowing last month preceded a drop of more than 12% for Bitcoin on Sept. 24. In addition, Bitcoin closed below its opening price in six of the last seven trading sessions. The last time it exhibited that pattern \u2014 in mid-September \u2014 it lost about 20% in one week.\u201d\n\nBall in Bulls\u2019 Court?\n\nWith volatility impending, a fair question to pose would be \u201cis the cryptocurrency ball in the court of the bulls or bears?\u201d\n\nAccording to what NewsBTC has observed from analysts over the past few days, the bulls\u2019 court, at least for now. A Bitazu Capital partner found that the Relative Strength Index, positive Directional Indicator, and negative Directional Indicator all have to reset to an important horizontal level,\u201d he argued before adding that \u201csuch levels have only one job: to turn the BTC price around.\u201d\n\nAside from that, a model that has predicted Bitcoin\u2019s trends to at least an 80% accuracy this year has shown that BTC will begin to trend higher into the coming year, and thus most likely bottomed at $7,700.\n\nAlso, Brave New Coin\u2019s Josh Olszewicz found that BTC is looking more bullish than otherwise. \u201c4h $BTC \u2013 bull div held \u2013 range lows held \u2013 back above bband midline (20SMA),\u201d he explained in a tweet.\n\nAgain, there are still valid bearish arguments. The most notable of these bearish arguments is the impending \u201cdeath cross\u201d for the Bitcoin chart. Analyst Chonis recently pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s 50-day and 200-day moving averages are currently facing down a \u201cdeath cross\u201d that may come to fruition in the coming week.\n\nShould this technical pattern come to fruition on Bitcoin\u2019s chart, it will show that bears have control of this market. As Chonis remarked, the last death cross, which was observed in 2018, marked the commencement of a long-term price correction.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin has found itself stuck yet again.
