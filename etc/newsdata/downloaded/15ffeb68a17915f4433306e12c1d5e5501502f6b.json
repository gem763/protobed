(@CoronaPD) October 25, 2019\n\n\u201cThe observant citizen watched a female burn dry brush using a flammable liquid before walking away,\u201d a statement by the department read.\n\n\u201cThe vigilant citizen was able to provide the suspect\u2019s clothing description and stayed on the phone with police dispatchers to direct officers to the suspect\u2019s location.\u201d\n\nPolice identified the woman as 27-year-old Aysah Magierek when they found her at a nearby site where she was attempting to ignite a second brush fire.\n\nAlthough the fire burned an area of about 30 feet by 60 feet, firefighters with the Corona Fire Department were able to extinguish the flames before they grew worse.\n\n\u201cAysah is currently on probation for arson in Riverside County.
