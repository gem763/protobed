REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nKim, in the letter sent in the third week of August, spoke of his \u201cwillingness\u201d for a third summit and extended an invitation for Trump to visit the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the Joongang Ilbo newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source.\n\nTrump on Aug. 9 said he had received a \u201cvery beautiful letter\u201d from Kim.\n\nBut U.S. officials have not said anything about a second letter in August.\n\nTrump and Kim have met three times since June last year to discuss ways to resolve a crisis over North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programmes, but substantive progress has been scant.\n\nTheir first two meetings were formal summits, the second of which, in Vietnam in February, broke down after they failed to narrow the gap between U.S. demands for North Korean denuclearisation and a North Korean demand for relief from sanctions.\n\nThey met for a third time on June 30 in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas and agreed to restart working-level talks but that has not happened.\n\nSince the June meeting, North Korea has several times tested short-range projectiles.\n\nThe White House, the U.S. State Department and the North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.\n\nA senior official at North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said on Monday that a \u201cgood meeting\u201d with working-level officials from the United States could take place within weeks, according to North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, said last week Pyongyang was willing to have \u201ccomprehensive discussions\u201d late this month.\n\nTrump subsequently said he would be willing to meet Kim at some point this year.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, asked about the report on Monday that there were \u201cdetailed explanations about such a letter\u201d but declined to elaborate.\n\nKang said it could be \u201ctoo much to expect\u201d that Trump and Kim would meet before any working-level talks.\n\n\u201cNo agreement was reached between the two leaders in Hanoi even after working-level negotiations,\u201d Kang told a parliamentary panel.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of the success of another summit, their working-level teams should meet and have primary discussions on the outcome of the summit.\u201d", "description": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un invited U.S. President Donald Trump to visit Pyongyang in a letter sent in August amid stalled denuclearisation talks, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday, citing diplomatic sources.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430273551&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F00C", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
