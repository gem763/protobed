After nearly a month of stonewalling, it appears clear that the president has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Trump was asked whether he would provide Democrats the documents they sought before the Friday deadline expired.\n\nHe replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s up to the lawyers. I know the lawyers think they\u2019ve never seen anything so unfair. They\u2019ve never seen anything so unjust.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been president now for almost three years, and I\u2019ve been going through this for almost three years. It\u2019s almost become, like, a part of my day.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that Democrats in the House of Representatives had the numbers to impeach him if they wished to, though he said he believed Republicans in the Senate would not confirm the censure. \u201cSo the Democrats, unfortunately they have the votes,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the subpoena was filed, the White House issued a statement claiming that it made little difference.\n\n\u201cThis subpoena changes nothing \u2013 just more document requests, wasted time, and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the president did nothing wrong,\u201d said spokesperson Stephanie Grisham.\n\n\u201cThe do-nothing Democrats can continue with their kangaroo court while the president and his administration will continue to work on behalf of the American people.\u201d\n\nWhile the White House sought to brush off the moves, it seems clear Mr Trump realises there is little he can do to avoid being impeached, if House speaker Nancy Pelosi seeks to call for a vote.\n\nWhile she has long been cautious about pursuing such a route, she has been left with few options after the outrage triggered by claims of an intelligence community whistleblower that Mr Trump sought to pressure the leader of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.\n\nIf she does not push for a vote of the House, it is hard to see how long she would retain her position as the Democrats\u2019 leader in the lower chamber.\n\nReports said the White House was expected to send a letter to Ms Pelosi arguing that congress could not mount its impeachment inquiry without first having a vote to authorise it. The letter was expected to say the administration would not cooperate with the probe without that vote.\n\nMr Trump said the resolution would likely pass the House, but he predicted it would backfire on Democrats. \u201cI really believe that they\u2019re going to pay a tremendous price at the polls,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s comments came shortly before Democrats sent an extensive request for documents to vice president Mike Pence about his contacts with Ukraine. Mr Pence spokesperson Katie Waldman, dismissed the new demand for documents, saying that given its wide scope, \u201cit does not appear to be a serious request\u201d.\n\nIt is likely the White House will claim the material sought by congress is covered by executive privilege, an issue that will likely be resolved by the courts.\n\nWhat is also unclear is what impact the impeachment battle will have on the 2020 election campaign. Polls show the country is roughly divided on whether Democrats should press ahead with such a move.\n\nThe president believes the move could help energise his base, as he decries the Democrats\u2019 actions as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press\n\nRead more\n\nPence says Democrats\u2019 request for impeachment documents \u2018not serious\u2019\n\nTrump admits Democrats could easily impeach him\n\nTrump has effectively confessed to an impeachable offence\n\nCNN refuses to air Trump adverts due to \u2018demonstrably false\u2019 claims", "description": "Democrats have issued a subpoena to the White House, demanding it hand over documents relating to Donald Trump\u2019s controversial Ukraine phone call as they sharply turned up the pressure of their impeachment probe.Two days after Democrats warned the president they would issue the subpoena if he did not", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.zMctIivEz3PW2NHJp05cw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3481a07b7579504cb61aa24b6db68a67", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
