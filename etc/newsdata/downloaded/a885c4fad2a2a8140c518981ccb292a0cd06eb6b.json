The teenager, the first protester hit by live fire during months of unrest, is in hospital in a stable condition.\n\nRiot police moved in to districts across Hong Kong overnight, firing tear gas at a chanting crowd in a residential area, while rail operator MTR Corp shut several stations as violence escalated.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nAll stations were operating normally on Friday morning.\n\nMTR\u2019s operations director Adi Lau urged protesters to stop damaging station facilities and rail tracks, saying it could hinder services and pose a severe danger to passenger safety.\n\nPro-Beijing groups have also been pushing for legislation to ban face masks at demonstrations but the government has declined to comment on whether it was considering one, or broader emergency laws, stating it would study existing legislation to cope with the protests.\n\nAuthorities have already loosened guidelines on the use of force by police, according to documents seen by Reuters.", "description": "Hong Kong's government is set to ban face masks at protests, media reported on Friday, as it struggles to end months of violent unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436935752&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930GH", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
