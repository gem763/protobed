The information is thought to have related to Trump\u2019s main presidential rival, the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.\n\nA few minutes into the interview, pugnacious anchor Chris Cuomo got to the point.\n\nCuomo: \u201cDid you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?\u201d\n\nGiuliani: \u201cNo. Actually I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCrystal clear. Except that 83 words and about 30 seconds later, Cuomo asked the question again.\n\nCuomo: \u201cSo, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\u201d\n\nGiuliani: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d\n\nThat Giuliani was prepared so blatantly to contradict himself on live TV in the service of the president perfectly encapsulates his transformation. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d, the hero of 9/11, has metamorphosed into what the New Yorker dubbed \u201cTrump\u2019s clown\u201d.\n\nThis is not the first time Giuliani has incurred ridicule and rebuke in the cause of protecting his longtime friend \u2013 no, client. In the final days of the 2016 election the lawyer was almost the only person willing to speak in favor of Trump after the \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d tape was aired.\n\nAs the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in that election reached its climax, Giuliani threw lawyerly restraint to the winds and repeatedly denounced the inquiry as a witch-hunt. Last August, he uttered words that will forever haunt him: \u201cTruth isn\u2019t truth.\u201d\n\nBut of all the scraps in which Giuliani has engaged in recent months, of all the obfuscations and verbal sleights of hand, this week\u2019s performance could prove the most damaging, both for him and for his White House buddy. America\u2019s Mayor has tied himself in ever-tighter knots over claims that at Trump\u2019s behest he improperly sought to coerce Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden in the hope of dredging up damaging information.\n\nNo fewer than three House committees this week launched investigations into the Trump-Giuliani efforts in Ukraine. Though not yet on the scale of Mueller\u2019s inquiry into whether Trump colluded with Russia, the new uproar bears chilling echoes of it.\n\nAt the heart of the row is the whistleblower complaint that was raised by an intelligence official on 12 August. Exactly what that complaint says is not yet known, but details have emerged that point the spotlight squarely at Ukraine.\n\nReporting led by the Washington Post suggests the unnamed official was so alarmed by Trump\u2019s \u201ccommunications with a foreign leader\u201d \u2013 now thought to be Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 that he or she considered it a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, the Wall Street Journal disclosed devastating new details of a phone conversation between Trump and Zelensky on 25 July. The paper reported that Trump pressed \u201cabout eight times\u201d for his opposite number to look into work in the country by Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nAnd, the Journal wrote, Trump explicitly urged Zelensky to work with one person in forwarding the mission: Rudy Giuliani.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump is reported to have pressed the Ukrainian president \u2018about eight times\u2019 to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter.

After all, he partly brought the Mueller inquiry down upon his own head by inviting Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in July 2016.\n\nBut if Trump\u2019s actions are peculiar, they are nothing compared with Giuliani\u2019s. For the past five months he has been telling anyone prepared to listen about his attempts to enlist Ukraine as a partner in Trump\u2019s re-election.\n\nGiuliani began thumping the Ukraine theme in April, when he laid out his theory \u2013 some would say, conspiracy theory \u2013 on Fox News. He accused the former vice-president of using bribery to shield his son from legal peril relating to business activities in the eastern European country.\n\nSpecifically, Giuliani alleged that Biden leant on a former Ukraine president to fire a top prosecutor who had been investigating corruption within a gas company on whose board Hunter Biden then served.\n\nA week after Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign, Giuliani blabbed to the New York Times that he had discussed the issue of the Bidens and Ukraine with Trump on \u201cmultiple occasions\u201d. He also divulged that he planned to make a trip to Kiev to meet the Ukrainian president.\n\nUnder US law, it is categorically illegal for anybody to solicit the help of any foreign national \u2013 let alone a government \u2013 for a US election. Yet here was Giuliani blithely telling the same newspaper a week later his visit to Kiev was intended to kickstart an investigation into the Bidens that could be helpful in next year\u2019s presidential race.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper \u2026 That information will be very, very helpful to my client.\u201d\n\nGiuliani cancelled his Kiev trip. Instead, he travelled to Madrid in August, where he met a top Ukrainian official whom he \u201cstrongly urged\u201d to reopen the investigation into the Bidens.\n\nPerhaps most incendiary of all are suggestions Trump and Giuliani may have tried to encourage the Ukraine government to play ball by invoking US aid to the country.\n\n\u201cThe potentially most explosive issue here is whether the president essentially offered Ukraine a quid pro quo,\u201d said Richard Pildes, professor of constitutional law at New York University.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll provide substantial US foreign aid if you provide damaging information concerning Joe Biden or his son.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The man once called America\u2019s Mayor has become the loosest of cannons, embroiling his boss in an election-meddling furore", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dadb7e9ecb0cb12e035116b3069dd83e19d34c6/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e5b03442ca0d841e1f879186549d0e18", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
