Maxine Waters (D-CA) said Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, \u201couted\u201d President Donald Trump as \u201cthe most corrupt man in America.\u201d\n\nMulvaney later released a statement saying, \u201cThere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nWaters said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s typical of Trump and all of his minions around him. They say what is on their mind asks then when they discover they\u2019ve messed up they try to so-called walk it back. So Mulvaney said exactly what was going on. There was a quid pro quo. Absolutely. He can try and walk it back all he wants, but just think about this. The president is talking about the reason he\u2019s into this altogether is simply he\u2019s trying to get the president of the Ukraine to investigate corruption. He\u2019s the most corrupt man in America, the president of the United States who has cheated, you know, contractor, subcontractors, won\u2019t show his own tax returns to Americans, who has cheated students who in the fake university so-called up in New York, the Trump University and he\u2019s talking about, he\u2019s going all of the way to Ukraine so that he can get the president to investigate corruption. Give me a break. They\u2019re liars. They\u2019re cheaters. These are con men. So Mulvaney said exactly what was on his mind and he discovered he messed up. So you messed up, but you told the truth and guess what? You\u2019re all going to get caught.\u201d\n\nOn Mulvaney\u2019s statement, Waters said, \u201cHe knew exactly what he was saying. He didn\u2019t just make a mistake. He was very clear and very deliberate. So Mulvaney, you just outed the president of the United States and all that\u2019s going on around him with you and Giuliani and all of you involved, and so we get it, and it\u2019s on record now and you can\u2019t take it back.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Thursday's broadcast of CNN's \"OutFront,\" Rep.
