The report's authors \u2013 Professor Anthony Shorrocks of the University of Manchester, Professor Jim Davies of the University of Western Ontario and Rodrigo Lluberas, an analyst at the Uruguay Central Bank \u2013 said this figure was \"one of the highest in any country and about six times the world average\".\n\nA total of 1.3 million Australians sit within the top 1 per cent of global wealth holders, with Australia accounting for 2.6 per cent of this ultra high net worth demographic. This was despite contributing just 0.4 per cent to the world's total adult population.\n\nAustralia currently has 1.18 million USD millionaires, up from just 108,000 in 2000, the report says.\n\n\"While the economic environment since the 2018 report has become more challenging in Australia, with sub-trend GDP growth and a weaker property market, the growth seen across investment markets has ensured Australia retained its consistently strong position as one of the wealthiest countries globally,\" Credit Suisse Australia head of private banking Michael Marr said.\n\nAll things being equal\n\nAustralia's relatively high representation in the ultra-high net worth demographic has not come at the expense of inequality, the report found.\n\nThe country has a Gini coefficient \u2013 the statistical measure of wealth inequality \u2013 of 66 per cent, well below that of Canada (72.8 per cent), the United Kingdom (74.6 per cent), Germany (81.6 per cent), India (83.2 per cent) and the United States (85.2 per cent). Just 7 per cent of Australians have a net worth of below $US10,000.\n\n\"Australia remains one of the countries with one of the most even distributions of income across its population out of all the countries in the report,\" Mr Marr said.", "description": "Average wealth per adult in Australia has fallen from $US411,060 to $US386,060 in the past 12 months, according to Credit Suisse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0352%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4b9a70dc3dbf830369eff422a4ca59a92d13c38c", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
