A typical person will spend more than three-quarters of their life working. On the other hand, some choose to start their businesses. According to a report by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, the United States has close to 27 million entrepreneurs. The 2010 US Census data shows that the population of the working-age Americans was about 244 million at the time of the census. As such, only close to 14% of working-age Americans are working on their businesses.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it is evident that more than 86% of working-age Americans are in employment. However, not all companies that these people work to offer a retirement plan. In the present employment environment, fewer employees stay loyal to a single company for long. Subsequently, companies seem to have given up trying to entice employees with pension schemes. Besides, many companies today are concerned more about operational and labor costs to increase profit margins. Therefore, such companies would rather not pay any pensions to their workforce.\n\nNevertheless, it is not all gloom for employees. There are still companies that believe in an organized retirement life for their workforce. Some of them are big multinational companies that are raking in immense amounts of profits annually. This article will rank the ten biggest companies that offer pensions in the United States.\n\nInvestors should consider the long-term implications of offering a defined benefit retirement plan as medical advances continuously extend the human life span. One of the reasons why old industrial behemoths like General Electric (NYSE:GE) is failing is that GE's current total pension obligations is around $92 billion. Little things add up.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s mission is to identify promising (and also terrible) stock pitches and share them with our subscribers. Our long strategy is based on the consensus picks of the 100 best performing hedge funds. This strategy was launched 5 years ago and generated a cumulative return of 115%. You can think of it as a mutual fund that returned 16.2% annually over the last 5 years, vs. 11.1% annual gain for the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Basically we outperform the S&P 500 Index by 5 percentage points annually by identifying the top stock picks of the best hedge fund managers (see the details here) and avoiding stocks like General Electric that are held back by legacy costs of unsound business decisions.\n\nAs the methodology of this research on other big companies that offer pensions, we searched for companies that offer a defined-benefit retirement plan. Further, we looked at the size of the defined benefit assets for each of the companies for the year 2016. In the ranking, the first company had the largest size of defined benefit assets while the last company has the smallest among the ranked companies. We compiled data from a combination of SEC filings and quarterly financial reports.\n\nDominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D)\n\nDominion Energy offers a comprehensive retirement plan that incorporates two different designs. On the one hand, the company offers a traditional pension design where benefits are calculated based on average and service earnings. On the other hand, the cash-balance pension design is strictly based on the years of the employee\u2019s service. This makes Dominion Energy one of the biggest companies that offer pensions. The company had $6.43 billion in total defined benefits assets in 2016.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_576714\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"750\"] Suwin/Shutterstock.com[/caption]\n\nSuwin/Shutterstock.com More\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (NYSE: LLY)\n\nEli Lilly & Co. offers a range of benefits to its employees that include profit sharing, stock bonus, 401(k) plan, and defined contribution pension plan. More important is the defined benefit pension plan to which all eligible employees have access. The total defined benefit assets under the control of the company were $7.16 billion as of 2016.", "description": "What are the biggest companies that offer pensions?
