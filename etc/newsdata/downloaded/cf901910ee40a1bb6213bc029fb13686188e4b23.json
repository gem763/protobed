Elizabeth Warren has risen to the top of the 2020 Democratic presidential pack in the early state of New Hampshire with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden close behind, according to a Monmouth University poll released on Tuesday.\n\nMs. Warren of Massachusetts was the top choice of 27% of New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters likely to vote in the first-in-the-nation primary, followed by Mr. Biden at 25%, according to the poll.\n\nThat marked a 19-point increase in support for Ms. Warren and an 11-point drop for Mr. Biden compared to a Monmouth survey from May.\n\n\u201cWarren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who easily won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, was next at 12% in the new poll \u2014 a 6-point decline since May.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, was next at 10%.\n\nAfter that, Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California was at 3%, and Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, Rep Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang were all at 2%.\n\nThe survey of 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in the February 2020 Democratic primary was taken from Sept. 17-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
