According to reports from the Chinese media, the firm aims to launch it into space in 2021.\n\nThe rocket uses liquid oxygen-methane propellants, and its primary stage can be used again for other launches. The company claims this reusability reduces the cost of rocket production by 70 percent.\n\nIt has a payload capacity of 1.9 ton, and it can contain small and medium-sized satellites. The Hyperbola-2 is 28 meters long and has a takeoff weight of 90 tons. It is designed to launch satellites into the Lower Earth Orbit (LEO).\n\nCurrently, Elon Musk\u2019s Space X is the only company with operational reusable rockets, called the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy. Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin also has a reusable rocket called the Blue Shephard, but it\u2019s still in a prototype stage.\n\nThis means small-time Chinese companies can afford to launch satellites at a lower cost. A survey released by Frost&Sullivan earlier this year, suggests the small satellite market can reach a cap of $69 billion by 2030. No wonder i-Space wants to launch various satellites from imaging to research in this range.\n\nRead next: Ethereum had a less than stellar Q3, intense 6 months ahead as ETH 2.0 looms \u2014 here's what happened", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FChina-rocket.jpg&signature=bd65d8efe22703b1202eed5e152223f9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
