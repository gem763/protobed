I have done my best over my career to keep my private life as private as possible so always stayed away from celebrity events. So to see myself on the front page while with my kids just for having a job in between acting jobs\u2026\n\n\u2018All actors go through it, I have had loads of other jobs. I was doing the doughnuts when I did Fish Tank. That\u2019s the life of an actor \u2013 I like to be busy and learn new things. I\u2019ve been a waitress, worked for a credit card company and everything.\u2019\n\nAnd she also wanted to make the point that her colleagues at the B&M Bargains store she works at really put in the hours and work as hard as any actor. She said: \u2018The people I work with are amazing and work hard for their money. As long as you\u2019re working, that\u2019s all that matters, no-one should be shamed for what they do.\n\n\u2018The way the story was portrayed wasn\u2019t very nice. It was quite nasty \u2013 to be made to feel degraded is wrong. Security guards put themselves at risk, there\u2019s a lot goes into it \u2013 I joined my sister there as she does the same job. I feel I need to stand up for working class people.\u2019\n\nWhile the initial feeling Katie got was shock and dismay, she was later made aware of the outpouring of support from celebrities from the soap, television, film and showbiz industries \u2013 and she admitted to being bowled over by the kind words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe smiled: \u2018I am overwhelmed by it, I didn\u2019t realise. I\u2019m not on Twitter so didn\u2019t see any of it. It\u2019s kept me away from the bad stuff but to hear that was amazing \u2013 I am so glad to have their support.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The actress currently works as a security guard.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90840017_1571739178.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
