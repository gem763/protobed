Clarkson pictured with his girlfriend Lisa Hogan\n\nHe gave his country estate the nickname Diddly Squat Farm because of its poor crop yields.\n\nBut Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s attempt to increase its earning power by building a farm shop may prove just as unproductive.\n\nNeighbours are furious about the TV presenter\u2019s plans \u2013 saying they could kill off businesses in their village.\n\nIn letters of objection to the council they also claim the development would blight a designated area of outstanding natural beauty. And they are unnerved by a reference in the former Top Gear presenter\u2019s planning application to the site\u2019s \u2018potential for occasional filmmaking\u2019.\n\nTony Allan, 73, a parish councillor in Chadlington, West Oxfordshire, said: \u2018The potential impact on the village store and butchers is a concern.\n\n\u2018It may only have space to accommodate ten cars when it opens, but God alone knows how it will develop.\n\n\u2018The Clarkson name will attract more people than that. People move to these kind of villages because they like them as they were. But we have seen new money coming into the Cotswolds \u2013 such as Soho Farmhouse, Daylesford organic farm shop and they risk changing the character of the communities.\u2019\n\nMr Allan\u2019s wife, Sue, is among those who have written to the council to object to the application. She said: \u2018The suspicion is that the shed will be used more for a filming project rather than to support a genuine farm business.\u2019\n\nClarkson, 59, filmed the destruction of a farmhouse on the site near Chipping Norton three years ago for Amazon Prime\u2019s The Grand Tour, which he stars in alongside Richard Hammond and James May. He later submitted plans for a new property on the site. The former Top Gear presenter is currently filming a \u2018warts and all\u2019 farming show for Prime.\n\nIn a newspaper column last month, he acknowledged the local opposition to his plans, saying: \u2018I recently applied for planning permission to build a small barn on my farm, from which I could sell stuff that happens to be in season.\n\nMr Clarkson has given his West Oxforshire country estate the nickname Diddly Squat Farm because of its poor crop yields\n\n\u2018And I was told by a local lady last weekend that it will \u201ckill the village\u201d. I couldn\u2019t see the logic, really. It wasn\u2019t as though I\u2019d applied for permission to do a low-level helicopter gunship strafing run down the high street. It\u2019d just be a barn with some vegetables in it.\u2019\n\nBut Michael Hinchliffe, another objector, said the farm shop would be \u2018seen for miles around\u2019 because of its elevated location adjacent to a main road and close to the entrance to a caravan site.\n\nIn his letter to the district council, he said: \u2018There is no evidence that this development will benefit farming or the local economy.\u2019\n\nAnother villager, Dr Julie Ingram, wrote of her fears that the farm shop and shed could prove a \u2018stepping stone to something that would be unacceptable\u2019. She added: \u2018The applicant\u2019s current farm has enough buildings and land to accommodate these planned developments, there is no need for a new location.\u2019\n\nAlison Weaver, 73, who runs Slatters Butchers in Chadlington, said: \u2018We get plenty of trade from people staying on the caravan site who walk down to us to get bacon and sausages for their breakfast. If he stocks meat he would take that trade away.\n\nIn letters of objection to the council, his neighbours claim the development would blight a designated area of outstanding natural beauty. Pictured: The land on which he wants to build his farm shop\n\n\u2018How serious is he about this? What if he got bored of it and then closed the farm shop? It might be too late for my business by then.\u2019 One villager who has spoken to Clarkson about his plans for the shop, suggested Mrs Weaver\u2019s fears about a short-lived enterprise were not entirely unfounded. \u2018As I understand it, the farm shop will be used as one of the filming locations for his new show,\u2019 the villager said. In a newspaper interview in May, the presenter said his I Bought a Farm programme would document \u2018actual farming: life, death and form-filling\u2019 on his mainly arable land, adding: \u2018We\u2019re not making Countryfile. We\u2019ll be showing it warts and all.\u2019\n\nWest Oxfordshire District Council is yet to make a decision on the application. Chadlington Parish Council has raised no objections \u2018as long as filming is for farming activities only and local produce only is sold.\u2019\n\nA representative for Clarkson said \u2018Jeremy is hard at work creating a viable, working farm across 1,000 acres in the Cotswolds.\n\n\u2018No more information is available at this time\u2019.Clarkson, who once claimed Norfolk people were so inbred they could not tell a Ferguson tractor from a Ford Capri, bought his property for \u00a34.25million in 2012.", "description": "Neighbours say the plans\u00a0could impact the village store and butcher.
