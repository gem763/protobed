What I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your d*ck isn't a question. It's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly', he said in a statement released just a day after the allegations came forward.\n\nDespite his confession, he faced no legal consequences for the sexual misconduct.\n\nHowever, his stand-up special was cut from Netflix and his relationship with HBO and FX were also axed.\n\nJust nine months later he returned to the spotlight. It wouldn't be long before he was creating more controversy for himself during an appearance at a Long Island comedy club in December, where he made reference to Parkland.\n\nStudents David Hogg, 18, and Emma Gonzalez, 19, became faces of the gun reform movement following the devastating Parkland shooting on February 14, 2018 where 17 people were killed at the hands of gunman Nikolas Cruz.\n\nCK's unleashed his brash, unapologetic style on the students.\n\n'They testify in front of Congress these kids\u2026What are you doing? You're young you should be crazy, you should be unhinged. Not in a suit saying 'I'm here to tell you\u2026' F**k you', he said in a clip leaked form the performance.\n\n'You're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot. Why does that mean I have to listen to you? Why does that make you interesting. You didn't get shot. You pushed some fat kid in the way and now I gotta listen to you talking'.\n\nAll the while the audience can be heard laughing during what was the comedian's sixth sold-out show at the club.\n\nThe comedian also made fun of today's youth and belittled gender-identity terms in his set.\n\nDespite his confession to sexually harassing women, CK faced no legal consequences for the sexual misconduct. Protesters are pictured outside one of his shows in San Jose, California\n\n'I'm so disappointed in the younger generation honestly because I'm 51 years old and I was 18 and in my 20s we were idiots. We were getting high doing mushrooms and sh*t\u2026I was kind of excited to be in my 50s and see people in my 20s and be like these kids are crazy, these kids are nice\u2026but they're not!' he said.\n\n'They're just boring. F**king telling me you shouldn't say that. What are you an old lady?...You should address me\u2026as they/them because I identify as gender neutral. You should address me as there\u2026because I'm a location\u2026and the location is your mother's c***', he added.\n\nHe compared them to royalty for demanding specific gender titles that they feel comfortable with.\n\nThe video of his set was posted on YouTube.\n\nIn his hour-long spiel he talked about his difficult year and how he lost $35million and alluded it to the sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\n'I live in New York. I f**king hate it now. I loved New York for 20 years. Now I'd rather be in Auschwitz, honestly. I mean Auschwitz now', he said.\n\nIn previous sets he said he feels that everyone hates him and was booed in public.\n\nThe clip sparked outrage on Twitter with users calling him a 'monster'.\n\nCK on his website says he is on 'on the road doing professional stand-up comedy,' providing no hint of the controversial tone he's taken. He describes his act as consisting of 'sharing jokes, stories, observations, lies, non-lies, and being generally ridiculous for the benefit of a laughing audience'.", "description": "Louise CK is going on tour for the first time since his controversial return to the stage making Parkland High School shooting and Auschwitz jokes after he faced sexual harassment accusations.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
