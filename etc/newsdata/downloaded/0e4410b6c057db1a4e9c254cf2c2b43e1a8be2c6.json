In his remarks to reporters, he then raised Biden as an example, although there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company.\n\n\u201cIt was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump said as he left the White House for a trip to Texas.\n\nBiden, who is among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, accused Trump of making a baseless political smear.\n\nBiden: Trump \u2018deserves\u2019 to be investigated over Ukraine call\n\nThe matter has sparked a fierce debate over whether Trump misused his office for political gain and whether his administration is withholding from Congress critical information about his actions. The incident is part of a whistleblower complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share details with lawmakers, citing presidential privilege.\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless Maguire provides information to Congress, administration officials \u201cwill be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d\n\nAnother impeachment holdout so far, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that \u201cwe may very well have crossed the Rubicon here.\u201d\n\nA person familiar with the matter has told The Associated Press that Trump urged Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden. The person wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the issue publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cUkraine\u2019s got a lot of problems,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cThe new president is saying that he\u2019s going to be able to rid the country of corruption and I said that would be a great thing. We had a great conversation. We had a conversation on many things.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted he said \u201cabsolutely nothing wrong\u201d to Zelenskiy. He did not answer directly when asked whether he would release a transcript of the conversation to the public.\n\nAfter arriving in Texas , Trump told reporters he will look into releasing details or a transcript of the call, but stressed that foreign leaders should feel free to speak frankly with an American president without fear that the details of their conversations will later be disclosed. Trump said if Ukraine released its own transcript it would be same as his version of the call.\n\nTrump and Zelenskiy plan to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly later this week.\n\nThe president has described the whistleblower as \u201cpartisan\u201d but has acknowledged not knowing the identity of the intelligence official who lodged a formal complaint against him with the inspector general for the intelligence community.\n\nThe complaint was based on a series of events, including the July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy, according to two people familiar with the matter. They were not authorized to discuss the issue by name and were granted anonymity.\n\nBiden said in Iowa on Saturday that \u201cTrump deserves to be investigated\u201d for \u201ctrying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Biden said Trump was motivated by politics \u201cbecause he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nA leading Republican senator urged the Justice Department to investigate the \u201cBiden-Ukraine connection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have looked at all things Russia and Trump, his family, everything about his family, every transaction between the Trump campaign and Russia,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nNow is the time, he said, to know \u201cwhat relationships, if any, did Biden world have to the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMichael Atkinson, the U.S. government\u2019s intelligence inspector general, has described the whistleblower\u2019s Aug. 12 complaint as \u201cserious\u201d and \u201curgent,\u201d but he has not been allowed to turn over the complaint to Congress.\n\nMaguire, the acting intelligence director, has been subpoenaed by Schiff\u2019s committee and is expected to testify publicly on Thursday. Maguire and Atkinson also are expected to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee this week.\n\n\n\n", "description": "President Trump appeared to confirm for the first time that he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden and his son on a July call with Ukraine\u2019s president,...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR806_trump__ZG_20190922165154.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
