But in an interview this week Lindblad said that may change.\n\nThe debt office needs to look into the matter \"very carefully\", and the upshot is that ultra-long bonds are \"still in play\", Lindblad said. \"We'll get back to this.\"\n\nLindblad first indicated in August that his office might expand its offering to add 100-year bonds, as negative interest rates spread across large swathes of the global fixed-income market, making it cheaper to issue. For now, Sweden's longest-dated bond matures in 2039, and is yielding about 0.3 per cent. Its other debt trades at negative rates, along with more than $US13 trillion ($19 trillion) in fixed-income securities worldwide.\n\nFor Sweden, a key consideration that's shaping its future debt issuance plans is demographic developments. \"From a macro perspective, one of the most important factors why we've seen these drops in real interest rates in the last 20 years are demographic factors,\" Lindblad said.\n\nAnother consideration for Sweden is liquidity. Neighbouring Finland has already said that's why it isn't considering issuing 100-year bonds.", "description": "Sweden's debt office is looking into the option of issuing bonds as long as 100 years, but wants more time to research the subject before making a decision.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2489%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_53/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d0319e7969f1a445103c209a65dadbce1c9c7f7f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
