We need to get this done before the October European Council.\n\nThis Government wants to get a deal, as I am sure we all do. If we cannot reach one, it would represent a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible. Our predecessors have tackled harder problems: we can surely solve this one.\n\nBoth sides now need to consider whether there is sufficient willingness to compromise and move beyond existing positions to get us to an agreement in time. We are ready to do that, and this letter sets out what I regard as a reasonable compromise: the broad landing zone in which I believe a deal can begin to take shape.\n\nOur proposed compromise removes the so-called \u201cbackstop\u201d in the previous Withdrawal Agreement. I have explained the difficulties with this elsewhere, including the fact that it has been rejected three times by the UK Parliament. Equally important in this context, the backstop acted as a bridge to a proposed future relationship with the EU in which the UK would be closely integrated with EU customs arrangements and would align with EU law in many areas. That proposed future relationship is not the goal of the current UK Government. The Government intends that the future relationship should be based on a Free Trade Agreement in which the UK takes control of its own regulatory affairs and trade policy. In these circumstances the proposed \u201cbackstop\u201d is a bridge to nowhere, and a new way forward must be found.\n\nThis is entirely compatible with maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland. Goods trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland makes up a little over one per cent of UK-EU total trade in goods. It is entirely reasonable to manage this border in a different way. Any risks arising will be management in both the EU single market and the UK market, particularly as all third country imports will continue to be controlled by the EU and UK customs authorities.\n\nWe are proposing that all customs processes needed to ensure compliance with the UK and EU customs regimes should take place on a decentralised basis, with paperwork conducted electronically as goods move between the two countries, and with the very small number of physical checks needed conducted at traders\u2019 premises or other points on the supply chain. To enable this, we should both put in place specific, workable improvements and simplifications to existing customs rules between now and the end of the transition period, in the spirit of finding flexible and creative solutions to these particular circumstances. These arrangements can be underpinned by a close cooperation between the UK and Irish authorities. All this must be coupled with a firm commitment (by both parties) never to conduct checks at the border in future.\n\nOverall, we recognise that our proposals will man changes from the situation that prevails in Ireland and Northern Ireland now. Our common task is to make sure that these changes entail as little day-to-day disruption as possible to the current situation. I believe that our proposals will achieve that.\n\nFinally, in order to support Northern Ireland through this transition, and in collaboration with others with an interest, this Government proposes a New Deal for Northern Ireland, with appropriate commitments to help boost economic growth and Northern Ireland\u2019s competitiveness, and to support infrastructure projects, particularly with a cross-border focus.\n\nTaken together, these proposals respect the decision taken by the people of the UK to leave the EU, while dealing pragmatically with that decision\u2019s consequences in Northern Ireland and in Ireland.\n\n- They provide for continued regulatory alignment for a potentially prolonged period across the whole island of Ireland after the end of the transition period, for as long as the people Northern Ireland agree to that.\n\n- They mean that EU rules cannot be maintained indefinitely if they are not wanted - correcting a key defect of the backstop arrangements.\n\n- They provide for a meaningful Brexit in which UK trade policy is fully under UK control from the start.\n\n- They ensure that the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland will remain open, enabling the huge gains of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement to be protected.\n\nI hope that these proposals can now provide the basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution, together with finalisation of the necessary changes to the Political Declaration reflecting the goal of a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, so that an Article 50 agreement can be reached, and the UK can leave the EU in an orderly fashion on 31 October. This will allow us to focus on the positive future relationship that I believe is in all of our interests.\n\nI am copying this letter and paper to other members of the European Council and to Michel Barnier.\n\nYours ever,\n\nBoris", "description": "Britain issued its proposals on Wednesday for how to deal with the Irish border after Brexit, removing the so-called backstop but with measures it said would avoid the need for checks or physical infrastructure.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
