Chubb\u2019s policy, for example, allows exceptions until 2022 and would not impact large diversified miners like Glencore, whose coal dependence falls below the threshold.\n\nPer a scorecard by a group of NGOs, some divestment policies define coal companies too narrowly to include many leading developers, while others exempt certain types of insurance or projects as well as assets managed for third parties.\n\nWhile divestment policies will raise premiums for utilities like RWE, AEP and Ameren, loopholes could end up dampening the effects. Even still, however, companies unaffected by the policies, like BHP, are planning coal exits in response to investor pressure.\n\nWhat to watch: Based on a Moody's forecast that coal could fall to 11% of the U.S. power supply by 2030, it will be easier for insurers to implement coal restrictions without hurting their bottom lines. More policies like Chubb's may soon be on the way.\n\nJustin Guay directs global climate strategy at the Sunrise Project and advises the ClimateWorks Foundation.", "description": "Chubb is the first U.S. insurance company to restrict its coal underwriting and investing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ysaIvubNwvxHR2YSf9NoudBZ8TM=/0x580:5568x3712/1920x1080/2019/07/18/1563484526933.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
