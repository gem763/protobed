In a meeting with legislative councillors on Tuesday, they said it was \u201cnot environmentally enlightened\u201d and \u201cruinously expensive\u201d.\n\nTwelve student representatives of the Hong Kong Green Schools Alliance expressed concerns about the plan\u2019s environmental impact. The alliance is part of the global school network, which aims to address climate change and promote sustainability.\n\nThe project was introduced by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in her policy address last year. Under Lam\u2019s plan, 1,700 hectares of artificial islands will be built at an estimated cost of HK$624 billion. Students criticised it for failing to meet performance, cost and time requirements. They also urged legislators to step in to halt funding for a Feasibility Study, which they believe would indirectly give the project the green light.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam defends HK$500 billion mega reclamation project near Lautau, but not everyone is convinced\n\n\u201cThe project is poorly justified by the government. Those artificial islands contradict Hong Kong\u2019s progressive vision for environmental sustainability,\u201d one student said.\n\nAt the meeting, lawmakers praised the students for making a \u201cmuch stronger case than the government\u201d. Legislator Andrew Wan Siu-kin said he and the students were \u201callies\u201d on objecting to the project, but he pointed out that it would be difficult to change the government\u2019s mind. \u201cEven though public opinion is not on the government\u2019s side, we do see quite often that the government insists on the wrong policies,\u201d Wan said.\n\nAnother legislator, Kwok Ka-ki, pledged to reflect students\u2019 opinions in committee meetings next year.\n\nTiffany Wong filed a letter of complaint to the Legislative Council on behalf of the Hong Kong Green Schools Alliance, which led to the meeting with lawmakers.

They also gave students a contact list, in case they need help for their future campaigns.\n\nTiffany Wong, 18, who graduated from Renaissance College this summer, filed the written complaint to the Public Complaints Office that led to the meeting. She felt it did not go very well. She said the lawmakers had failed to provide useful pointers on how to promote their campaign.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers pretty much gave us excuses and false hope in a way, although I kind of expected the meeting to end like that,\u201d she said.\n\nOpinion: Why we need to support the Hong Kong government's new land reclamation project\n\nKristy Yip, of King George V School, felt the council members were a little patronising, and had doubts about the effectiveness of taking their campaign to the public.\n\n\u201cThey congratulated us and said we did a good job, which I think we really did, but it doesn\u2019t tell us what our next step should be,\u201d said Kristy.\n\n\u201cThe government currently isn\u2019t really listening to the people, even though they\u2019ve made a big scene. Why should we believe that if we took the campaign to the public, the government would do anything else?\u201d she asked.", "description": "Representatives of the Green Schools Alliance condemned the project as massively damaging to the environment and hugely overpriced", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/201a77ba-fa0d-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15imagehires183843.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
