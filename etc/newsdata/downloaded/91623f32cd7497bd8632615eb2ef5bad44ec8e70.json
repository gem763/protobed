Individual behavior change isn\u2019t action\u2014it\u2019s distraction.\n\nBut worse than that: every carbon offset bought by a well-meaning liberal is another get-out-of-jail free card for the fossil fuel industry and the other major contributors to global climate destruction. It shifts the blame from the actual causes of climate change to fake ones, and shifts attention away from meaningful actions to meaningless, psychological ones. And by making real solutions harder to achieve, the mistaken focus on individual behavior change makes global warming worse.\n\nFirst, if you run the numbers, it\u2019s obvious that even if every do-gooder in the world changed their light bulbs to fluorescents, stopped going on vacation, and bought carbon offsets for every art project they built at Burning Man, none of this would make a dent in global carbon dioxide emissions. There just aren\u2019t enough bleeding hearts to go around.\n\nMoreover, individual behaviors are not the major causes of global warming.\n\nThe major drivers are collective enterprises like power grids, industry, and transportation systems. Cutting back on flying while allowing cars and trucks to operate as usual is like drinking diet soda with a bacon double cheeseburger. Their benefit is negligible, and totally negated by the much, much larger problems that are going unchecked.\n\nFighting global warming takes systemic change, collective action, and cooperation (witting or not) among much larger populations, not just those motivated (and privileged) enough to make changes by themselves.\n\nIt takes legislation to shift the most carbon-intensive industries\u2014energy production, transportation, and food production\u2014who will not change on their own.\n\nAnd it takes real solutions for China and India, who are rapidly approaching United States levels of resource consumption, and who have no intention of missing out on the benefits that Europe and the U.S. have enjoyed (itself an offensive, colonialist notion).\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the numbers.\n\nTwenty-five percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity generation. If you turn off the light when you leave the room, will that make a difference? Not at all. In the immediate term, excess electricity is dumped back into the grid. Nor, in the long term, will it even matter if everyone switched off their lights. Demand may go down a tiny bit, but only a tiny bit.\n\nWhat would help? If power grids shifted from fossil fuels (coal, fracked gas, oil) to renewables like wind and solar. That\u2019s how to move the needle on global warming: collective solutions to collective problems. But that takes collective action, government action, and serious plans for workers displaced by the changes.\n\nTo take a second example, transportation is responsible for another 14 percent of emissions. Does that mean you shouldn\u2019t take your next vacation, as some well-intentioned writers have seriously suggested? Of course not.\n\nFirst, commercial aircraft account for only 7 percent of transportation-related emissions. Passenger cars account for 42 percent, and all trucks 41 percent. The solutions in this area, obviously, are to increase fuel efficiency standards, charge a tax on high-emitting vehicles, stop regulating SUVs like cars when they\u2019re really trucks, subsidize electric and hybrid vehicles, and use tax policies to incentivize local products to decrease the amount of trucking.\n\n\u201c If fighting global warming is about making annoying personal sacrifices, those who most need to be persuaded of climate change\u2019s reality will instead turn away from it. \u201d\n\nAnd what about the rest of the world? Is it reasonable to expect newly rich residents of China, India, and elsewhere to abstain from the air travel that Americans have enjoyed for decades? No, it\u2019s colonialist. But without China and India, what is the point of this individual self-deprivation?\n\nI could go on and on, but the point is the same every time. Individual actions are meaningless when collective actions aren\u2019t taken.\n\nWhy do we do them, then?\n\nControl and consolation. For those who understand the science, global warming is a terrifying reality. My daughter\u2019s world will be so much worse than mine: half a billion climate refugees, ethno-nationalist backlashes to that unprecedented migration, global food disruptions, massive expenditures to mitigate the effects of flooding, crop shifts, extreme weather events. I have to do something, right?\n\nChanging my individual behavior feels empowering, maybe even virtuous. The world may be going to hell, but I\u2019m doing my part.\n\nIndeed, the self-deprivation is part of the point. By making painful sacrifices, I feel like I\u2019m making a difference.\n\nUnfortunately, not only is this view false; it\u2019s also profoundly counterproductive.\n\nFirst, this kind of self-martyrdom detracts from the kind of change that\u2019s actually needed. The environment doesn\u2019t need martyrs; it needs pragmatic, committed activists. Every bit of energy I waste on ineffective, virtuous action is energy that should be spent on defeating Republicans, who, at least for now, are wholly in the thrall of the fossil fuel industry. With a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president, the United States could be making progress on global warming in 2021.\n\nAnd incidentally, that would be true of any Democrat. The Green New Deal is an appealing slogan and a provocative program, but specific policies are a distant second, when it comes to global warming, to placing scientifically based realists in positions of power. The sole focus of anyone alarmed by global warming should be electing Democrats, of any ideological stripe, to federal and state government.\n\nSecond, the focus on individual behavior makes fighting global warming more controversial, while letting the actual entities causing of climate change off the hook. As Elizabeth Warren recently pointed out in an exchange on CNN, individual sacrifices\u2014she mentioned straws, light bulbs, and cheeseburgers\u2014\u201care exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nNo one likes paper straws. If fighting global warming is about making annoying personal sacrifices, those who most need to be persuaded of climate change\u2019s reality will instead turn away from it.\n\nMeanwhile, Warren continued, 70 percent of U.S. global warming emissions come from three industries: fossil fuels, electric power, and construction. Shift the power grid to renewables, and you can use as many straws as you want. (Side-note: plastic straws pollute the oceans, not the atmosphere. It\u2019s not even the same issue.)\n\nEvery carbon offset bought by a well-meaning liberal is another get-out-of-jail free card for the oil industry. It shifts the blame from the actual causes of climate change to fake ones, and shifts attention away from meaningful actions to meaningless, psychological ones.\n\nNow, collective change is hard. It requires progressives to do things like compromise, persuade, and engage with the 28 percent of Americans who describe themselves as \u201ccautious\u201d or \u201cdisengaged\u201d about climate change, rather than isolate themselves into cozy bubbles where everyone uses canvas bags. It requires latte-sipping liberals like me to empathize with people who really like eating meat and driving cars and work to adapt climate solutions to their life choices, instead of being contemptuous of them. Most of all, it requires pragmatism over utopianism, to which many progressives are almost congenitally allergic.\n\nBut the planet does not have time for our preferences.", "description": "Liberals who call for personal sacrifice to combat climate change aren\u2019t helping.
