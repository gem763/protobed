We are looking for you and I urge you to hand yourself into a police station as soon as possible.\n\n\"I also wish to remind anybody that might be assisting or asked to assist those responsible that it is a criminal offence to do so and can lead to prosecution.\"\n\n(Image: south bedsnews agency_sbna_fairl)\n\n(Image: south bedsnews agency_sbna_fairl)\n\nDetectives believe the two dead teens knew their killers. One of the boys died at the scene while the other passed away in the early hours after being rushed to hospital.\n\nPolice said two other males, aged 17 and 23, were injured in the violence that broke out just before midnight in Emerson Valley.\n\nThe pair suffered serious but not life threatening injuries during the attack, which detectives described as \u201cdreadful\u201d.\n\nDCS Hunter added: \"One of these males has now been discharged from hospital, but the other remains in hospital but I am pleased to say he is recovering from his injuries.\n\n\"Clearly this is a dreadful incident and a significant investigation led by our Major Crime Unit continues.\n\n\"There remains an increased police presence in Archford Croft in Emerson Valley and we are conducting house to house and CCTV enquiries as this fast-moving investigation continues. I expect us to remain at the address for several days to come.\"\n\n(Image: Vagner Vidal/Hyde News & Pictures Ltd)\n\n(Image: Vagner Vidal/Hyde News & Picture)\n\nThe detective said Home Office post-mortems for the two boys that died will take place on Tuesday, and the families of both victims are being supported by \"specially trained family liaison officers and they remain uppermost in our thoughts\".\n\nOne woman said she previously contacted police warning that youngsters were being \u201cgroomed\u201d by criminals in the area.\n\nNash Tee posted on Facebook on Sunday night: \u201cWe\u2019ve reported this address and these activities and gangs in that area.\n\n\u201cPolice have been called several times when kids are missing are at this address and they have done nothing about it.\n\n\u201cWe know there are adults grooming kids in around this postcode but police have done nothing about it.\n\n\u201cNow they have to react because the situation has got out of hand.\u201d\n\n(Image: Geoff Robinson)\n\nIn another post she added: \u201cThere are adults involved and teenagers are being reeled into crime for various reasons.\n\n\u201cIf the police can\u2019t make the citizens especially minors feel safe then who will?\n\n\u201cDisappointed in Thames Valley Police.
