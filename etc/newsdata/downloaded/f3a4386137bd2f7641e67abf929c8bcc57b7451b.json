You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nEU search and rescue operations have been downgraded and de-funded in recent years as European government policies towards refugees have hardened. Some governments, like Italy\u2019s, have even waged a campaign to try to stop NGOs rescuing drowning migrants with their own resources.\n\nAround 18,000 people have died in the Mediterranean since 2014, according to figures released by the UN\u2019s International Organisation for Migration at the start of the month \u2013 most of them people trying to make the crossing to Europe.\n\nThe bulk of the votes to defeat the motion came from the parliament\u2019s largest political group, the centre-right European People\u2019s Party. The EPP is the home of mainstream pro-EU conservative politicians such as Angela Merkel, Jean-Claude Juncker, and incoming European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nMEPs from Leo Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael party in Ireland also voted against the motion \u2013 a move that has prompted a major political storm in Ireland.\n\nThe centre-right parties were joined in defeating the motion by far-right and Eurosceptic parties, including the huge delegation from the UK\u2019s own Brexit Party. Across members states, most socialists, liberals, greens and leftists supported the motion, which was put to a vote on Thursday.\n\n\u201cFar too many people are losing their lives in the Mediterranean,\u201d said Juan Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar, the motion\u2019s rapporteur and a Spanish socialist MEP.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent situation and we have a system that is in urgent need of reform. We are not getting that same sense of urgency from the commission or member states, nor from the centre-right European People\u2019s Party.\n\n\u201cToday made it clear that political groups on the right are willing to abandon their legal and moral obligations. They are failing to act responsibly to save lives at sea. Far-right groups often dismiss our approach but it is extremely disappointing that even MEPs on the centre-right do not share any sense of solidarity.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
