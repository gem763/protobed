Threat to railway and power grid,\u201d the fire department said.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issues for residents near the mobile home park, fire officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the hot gusty winds that usually hit northern California in October, sometimes called the \u201cDiablo Winds\u201d, will continue into Friday morning.\n\nMuch of northern California, from San Francisco to the Oregon border, remains under a state \u201cred flag\u201d fire alert.\n\nNewsom faulted PG&E for putting what he called \u201cgreed\u201d ahead of investments in its infrastructure to harden the electrical grid against dangerous winds.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.\n\nAs winds moved south, a similar cutoff was under way by Southern California Edison, which warned more than 173,000 customers they could lose power.", "description": "A fierce wildfire that erupted in southern California on Thursday destroyed homes and structures and caused \"numerous medical emergencies\" at a Riverside County mobile home park, fire officials said.", "authors": ["Dan Whitcomb", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
