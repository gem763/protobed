Processing is snappy and the UI is extremely friendly and intuitive, making it easy to settle in for a night of Netflix (or Hulu, or Amazon Prime, or YouTube, or Twitch, or anything else) without a hitch. This box also comes with a very easy-to-use remote and a pair of headphones that plug right into it for private listening, as well an ethernet cable input so you can easily stream 4K/HDR content, if that's your bag.\n\nGet the Roku Ultra from Amazon for $69.99\n\n3. For the techy type: Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen.)\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Echo Dot (3rd Gen.) (Photo: Amazon)\n\nIf you're shopping for a tech generalist or somebody who just really loves asking Alexa to tell jokes, why not pick up the all-new Echo Dot? This tiny smart speaker integrates with your Amazon account, meaning you can ask it for shopping recommendations, what the weather's going to be, to play music, or to integrate with your existing smart home fixtures (like turning lights on and off). This isn't the ideal music-lover's smart speaker (it's a bit too small for great sound), but as an all-around device it's a great addition for any technophile you're shopping for.\n\nGet the Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen.) from Amazon for $39.99\n\n4. For the homeowner: Logitech Circle 2 indoor/outdoor camera\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Logitech Circle 2 (Photo: Logitech)\n\nGot a new homeowner on your list, or an old homeowner who wants to feel a little more secure? The Logitech Circle 2 is our top security camera pick. It's easy to set up and program to monitor a room inside, a patio, or your front door, and is weather-proof enough to live outside for long periods of time.

This 55-inch Roku TV from TCL has topped TV reviewers' lists of \"best value TV\" for the last couple years, and for good reason. For what you're paying, you're getting 4K resolution, full-array local dimming, the Roku smart platform, and HDR (High Dynamic Range) compatibility\u2014that's a lot of cheddar. When it comes to TV value picks, this one is king for a reason.\n\nGet the 55-inch TCL 6 Series Roku TV from Amazon for $529\n\n6. For the frequent flyer: Sony WH-1000XM3 Headphones\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Sony WH-1000XM3 Noise Canceling Headphones (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you're buying a gift for a frequent traveler, we can't recommend the WH-1000XM3 headphones from Sony enough. Not only are they absolutely stellar in the noise canceling department (sayonara, airplane baby!), they sound incredible and are lightweight and comfortable for hours at a time. Multiple Reviewed employees used these over a course of months, and each had nothing but praise (and didn't want to give them back). They're a bit pricy, but the premium experience makes them worthwhile.\n\nGet the Sony WH-1000XM3 noise canceling headphones from Amazon for $348\n\n7. For the book lover: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (Photo: Reviewed / Michael Roorda)\n\nAmazon's latest Kindle Paperwhite, technically the 10th generation model, is the best one yet. Not only does it continue to do what Kindles do best\u2014hold hundreds, perhaps thousands of novels, short stories, poems, comics, and PDFs\u2014it's also waterproof, and features multiple colors and storage options with a battery that lasts weeks. It's no wonder the Paperwhite is #1 in our Best Kindles roundup.\n\nGet the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite from Amazon for $129\n\n8.

Nintendo's latest home console delivers fun for kids of all ages, and doubles as both an on-the-TV device and a handheld device, giving it an unsurpassed amount of flexibility where gaming goes. With award-winning titles like Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey at hand, the Nintendo Switch is the must-have gaming peripheral for the 2019 holiday season.\n\nGet the Nintendo Switch from Amazon for $299\n\n9.

In our tests, the Ecovacs Deebot N79S performed admirably in its room cleaning routine, navigating our in-lab obstacle course like it built it itself. While it's not a replacement for a full standing vacuum cleaner and requires some in-app tinkering to work best, this is a great way to make cleaning a snap, especially if you're more inclined to kick back than clean up.\n\nGet the Ecovacs Deebot N79S from Amazon for $199.99\n\n10. For the marathon runner: Garmin Forerunner 245 running watch\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Garmin Forerunner 245 (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nIf you're buying a gift for a serious runner\u2014the kind of person who seems to always be training for a 5K or even a marathon\u2014Garmin's line of Forerunner GPS/music running watches should be on your gift list. While they're definitely pricy, they're stuffed with useful tech for long-haul runners, like training features, advanced running dynamics, and safety features.\n\nGet the Garmin Forerunner 245 from Amazon for $349.95\n\n11. For the one trying to stay fit: Fitbit Charge 3 fitness tracker\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Fitbit Charge 3 (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nFitness trackers are a great way to stick to your fitness goals and have a little personal fitness coach on your wrist, and the Fitbit Charge 3 has been our favorite fitness tracker for quite some time. Count steps, measure calorie burn, or simply measure the quality of your sleep with a minimally designed watch that won't get in the way of the rest of your life. This is a great gift for anyone starting (or trying to maintain) fitness goals this year.\n\nGet the Fitbit Charge 3 from Amazon for $139.99\n\n12.

For the serious gamer: Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming Laptop\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Dell Inspiron 15 (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you're looking to buy a laptop for someone who is serious about PC gaming, we highly recommend the Dell Inspiron 15\u2014specifically the configuring featuring an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of ram, a 256GB SSD, and a GTX 1060 graphics processor. The 15.6 screen gives you a large viewing area, but unlike the gaming laptops of yesteryear, this one doesn't weight 15 lbs.\n\nGet the Dell Inspiron 15 gaming laptop from Walmart for $734.99\n\n15. For the one who's always running: JLab Audio Epic Sport earbuds\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: JLab Audio wireless headphones (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you're shopping for somebody who already loves running and participates enthusiastically, a solid pair of exercise-focused headphones like the JLab Audio Epic Sport wireless are an excellent choice.

For the music lover: Sonos One SL\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Sonos One SL (Photo: Amazon / Sonos)\n\nSonos has been a leading name in home audio solutions for years, and the Sonos One SL is a testament to that legacy. We loved the One for its clean audio presentation, including crispy trebles and booming bass, as well as how easy it is to set up and interface with existing Sonos speakers in the home. While it's not a take-it-to-the-park speaker, as a home solution it offered better audio than anything we tested, and will definitely impress any music lover you might be shopping for.\n\nGet the Sonos One SL from Amazon for $179\n\n17. For the hip technophile: Apple Watch (Series 4)\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Apple Watch Series 4 (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nOur top-rated smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 4 is a great choice for iPhone users looking to up their productivity and technical grasp with a gadget that's also pretty stylish. During testing, we found that the Apple Watch outperformed the other smartwatches, doing double duty as both a minimalist smartphone stand-in and as a potential smartphone replacement (assuming you don't need LTE services). If you're shopping for someone who lives in their iPhone, this watch could be the perfect addition.\n\nGet the Apple Watch (Series 4) from Amazon for $349\n\n18. For the media enthusiast: Microsoft Xbox One X\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Microsoft Xbox One X (Photo: Microsoft)\n\nMicrosoft's so-called \"Most Powerful Console Ever\" does a lot more than play video games. Yes, you can game on it, but its true purpose is to stand in as the center of a home theater setup. The X in particular is equipped to play DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, and almost any media from a USB; is Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos compatible; and outputs native 4K and HDR content, making it one of the fanciest gaming machines around that isn't a tower PC. If you've got an AV nerd on your gift list, this could be the perfect centerpiece to their tech-filled living room.\n\nGet the Microsoft Xbox One X from Amazon for $399\n\n19. For the adventurous techy: Potensic G25 GPS Drone\n\nBest tech gifts 2019: Potensic G25 drone (Photo: Reviewed / Adam Doud)\n\nNot only are some drones very safe for younger flyers, but they're pretty affordable these days. The Potensic G25 GPS-equipped drone took our #1 spot when we tested drones under $200, and for good reason. Its intuitive control scheme and robust flying patterns make it a great drone for anyone curious about the art of robotic flyers, and it won't break the bank in the process.\n\nGet the Potensic G25 GPS drone from Amazon for $149.99\n\n20.
