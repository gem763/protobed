We just played it,\u201d said a delighted Klopp.\n\n\u201cVery often the result is the result of the performance. The performance was really, really good. I liked it a lot. Being 1-0 down against Tottenham with the strength they have in counter-attacking is really tough.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe game I loved, a super game, how football should look, how we should play against a really strong, good organised side.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Kane strikes \u2013\n\nKane struck inside a minute, becoming the joint-third highest scorer in the famous club\u2019s history with his 174th goal in Tottenham colours.\n\nIt was also one of the simplest after Moussa Sissoko sparked a scrambling couter-attack and set Son Heung-min racing upfield.\n\nThe South Korean\u2019s powerful strike from the edge of the area took a wild deflection off the head of Dejan Lovren before striking the woodwork but the rebound fell kindly for Kane to stoop and head into the gaping net.\n\nIt was a lead that lasted, somehow, until the 52nd minute when a Henderson cross was headed clear and turned back into the area by Fabinho.\n\nDanny Rose appeared to nudge Roberto Firmino in the back but, with referee Anthony Taylor unmoved, the ball continued to the corner of the six-yard area where Henderson hit it on the half-volley into the Spurs goal.\n\nMinutes earlier, Spurs might have doubled their lead when Son was sent clear on the end of a long clearance by keeper Paulo Gazzaniga. He rounded Alisson Becker but could only strike the cross-bar from a tricky angle.\n\nBut the equaliser was no more than Liverpool deserved after a dominant first-half spell in which only an inspired performance from stand-in goalkeeper Gazzaniga maintained the visitors\u2019 lead.\n\nIn one breathless, four-minute spell, Liverpool carved out five excellent chances, with Gazzaniga peerless in dealing with them.\n\n\u201cIn this season we deserve more points on the table,\u201d said Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino, whose side are languishing in 11th spot in the table.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moment to stay strong, to keep pushing. Of course in a different season this could have finished two or three nil for us. But today for us it is a different way and it is important for us it is to stay calm and take the best decisions for the future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve nothing (critical) to say because after five-and-a-half years it\u2019s a moment to be all together and show our support.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool (AFP) \u2013 Mohamed Salah claimed the 50th Anfield goal of his Liverpool career from the penalty spot as the Premier League leaders restored", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/25c57e_liverpool-mohamed-salah-celebrates-scoring-penalty-tottenham-salah-fires-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
