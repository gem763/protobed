The company has suffered several setbacks this month, after major companies including Mastercard, PayPal, and Visa, withdrew their support.\n\nRegulators and governments have aired concerns about how a new synthetic global currency could negatively impact the world\u2019s financial system, poses a threat to user privacy, and facilitate money laundering.\n\nIn fact, just last week, the G7 said stablecoins shouldn\u2019t be allowed to launch until international risk was properly assessed.", "description": "Facebook's controversial 'cryptocurrency' Libra could be based on national currencies such as the dollar, the tech giant has said.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design-97.jpg&signature=3f9608c9a634d011f51914638362a134", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
