However, after he picked up a win at RIZIN 15 in April, he felt ready to pursue the next jump in his MMA career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more older and more experienced,\u201d Albrektsson told MMA Junkie at a media day held Thursday. \u201cAt the time I was very young when I got the call. I was already (preparing) for a competition, so I had my focus on other stuff. Now, I feel like I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ve faced tough guys already and I\u2019m ready to make the step.\u201d\n\nAlbrektsson is taking his fight with Davis seriously. So seriously, in fact, he shaved off his signature golden locks. A new beginning calls for a new hairdo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of taking care of and a lot of wrestling,\u201d Albrektsson said. \u201cIt gets (very) messy. A lot of shampoo bills. (I\u2019ll) just make it grow out again and look nice.\u201d\n\nBellator 231 takes place Friday at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn. The main card airs on Paramount and streams on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nCheck out Karl Albrektsson\u2019s full pre-fight interview in the video above.", "description": "Swedish fighter Karl Albrektsson had talked with Bellator in the past and had declined previous offers.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Simon Samano", "The Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mmajunkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/karl-albrektsson-bellator-231-pre.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
