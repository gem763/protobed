Seems like Trump and lying fake news media outlets like Ben Shapiro\u2019s Daily Wire trash rags are practicing their best.

It is despicable. Additional words fail me. https://t.co/AJ8caUoM3W \u2014 Matt Armstrong (@mountainrunner) October 30, 2019\n\nHow could they possibly screw up a lovely story about a brave dog helping to capture the world's most wanted terrorist? By photoshopping said dog into a picture with Trump to remind us this president would never, ever, ever touch a dog in real life. https://t.co/OaEbFhbQ6P \u2014 Molly Knight (@molly_knight) October 30, 2019\n\nSomewhere out there, Donald Trump Jr. is photoshopping his face over the dog\u2019s face. https://t.co/VXHigYnIq6 \u2014 Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) October 30, 2019\n\nFine, just the president of the United States disseminating a doctored image created by a right-wing propaganda site. pic.twitter.com/Ky26zdDaXe \u2014 S.V.

Obviously it is doctored but to be tweeted out like that without context makes people believe it's real, and from the other responses, people do actually think that. \u2014 Valerie Schremp Hahn \u1f4f (@valeriehahn) October 30, 2019\n\nFake News: President Trump Did NOT Award K-9 Medal Of Honor To The Dog Who Chased Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi To His Death https://t.co/uHBrDlcVln #fakenews pic.twitter.com/fpbIyWjAvO \u2014 Lead Stories (@LeadStoriesCom) October 30, 2019\n\nWhat a way to treat a war hero.
