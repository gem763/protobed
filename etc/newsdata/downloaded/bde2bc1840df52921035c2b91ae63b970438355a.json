The big part of being in jail is you are cut off and denied your liberty. With the spread of mobile phones that's completely irrelevant.\n\n'It's difficult to keep order in jail because staff are outnumbered. If prisoners don't take the authority seriously, it makes a joke out of the whole system.\n\n'People see [videos posted on social media from inside jail] and they are less frightened of jail, they think their mates are having a whale of a time.'\n\nAlthough the video was not captured there, those in charge at Walton prison have outlined the steps they are taking to crack down on those bringing contraband into the jail.", "description": "The video was captured by a Liverpool man who slams the food being laid out for them, referring to it as 'HMP Toby Carvery, s***hole'.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/15/19658142-0-image-a-31_1570978570737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
