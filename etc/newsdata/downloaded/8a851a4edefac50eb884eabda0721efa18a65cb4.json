If you lose your two-factor authentication device you can regain access to the coins after some time, explains Back, so there is some form of recovery mechanism. However, if you lose the backup of your keys, you will not be able to access your money, as nobody can provide you with a new way in \u2013 nobody knows your keys.\n\n\u201cI think there's a possibility in the future for a sort of combination where you can have the protection from losing your backups and yet still have control,\u201d Back says. He explains that Blockstream is looking at a method \u2013 another step in the recovery process \u2013 whereby if you lose the backup, there is another backup that would allow people to get to their money. The technology is easy to use, says Back, but it needs to be safe too, in a sense that people wouldn\u2019t lose money due to a backup mistake.\n\n\u201cI think, counter intuitively, we should be able to have user control \u2013 like you actually have your keys and a bank-like sort of two-factor authentication device to approve your transaction, [which] makes you much safer from malware and hackers [\u2026] \u2013 and the ability to recover from backup failure if you lose your backups.\u201d\n\nBack also said that Blockstream recently announced Tor support for its Green Wallet which hides somebody\u2019s IP address and protects their privacy.\n\nLearn more:\n\nBlockstream's Samson Mow on Their Main Focus and Mining Via Satellite\n\nHow to Protect Your Absolute Crypto Lifeline - Seed Words\n\nThe Paper Wallet Debate: Are They Safer or Riskier than Other Wallets?\n\nTurn Your Old Smartphone into Ethereum Hardware Wallet", "description": "CEO of Canada-based blockchain technology firm Blockstream, Adam Back, said that the company is looking into ways how to help crypto users to recover lost bitcoin (BTC).", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5db/1c7de58790.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
