Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families.

Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw).
