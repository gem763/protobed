I want to pay for it in a progressive way.\"\n\nHis comments come as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 who backs Sanders' Medicare for All plan \u2014 is being pressed on how she would want the country to pay for such a plan. She has said she will be releasing a plan for financing Medicare for All in the coming weeks.\n\nHarwood asked Sanders if he thinks it's foolish for Warren to release her own detailed plan. Sanders said he doesn't.\n\n\"All that I'm saying is that we have laid out a variety of options that are progressive,\" Sanders continued. \"We'll have that debate. At the end of the day, we will pay for every nickel of Medicare for All, and it will save the overwhelming majority of the American people, who will no longer pay premiums.\"\n\nWhen Sanders introduced Medicare for All on Capitol Hill this year, he also released a document listing potential ways to pay for the plan. These include raising taxes on top earners and imposing a wealth tax for the richest Americans, as well as a 4% tax on Americans earning over $29,000 and a new tax on employers.\n\nBut those were characterized as \"options.\" The question is which ones he would want to institute, and how big the price tag is that those taxes will be covering.\n\nOpponents of Medicare for All, like former Vice President Joe Biden, argue that the price tag is too big, and that the federal budget would balloon to pay for it.\n\nSupporters like Sanders and Warren argue that Medicare for All would not create new health care spending, but rather would simply shift current spending \u2014 and, potentially, ultimately reduce overall spending and save money. Estimates vary as to whether there actually would be savings, and how big those savings would be.\n\nMedicare for All supporters like Sanders and Warren argue that while taxes would have to help pay for such a system, many Americans would see their overall health care costs go down because they would no longer be paying current costs like premiums and meeting deductibles.\n\nThe conversation over how to finance ambitious plans like Medicare for All plays out against a backdrop of rapidly growing deficits under the Trump administration. Since Trump signed the Republican tax cuts into law at the end of 2017, the federal deficit has grown to nearly $1 trillion, the Treasury announced Friday. That's an increase of nearly 50%, as the Washington Post noted.", "description": "\"You're asking me to come up with an exact detailed plan of ... how much you're going to pay more in taxes, how much I'm going to pay,\" Sanders said. \"I don't think I have to do that right now.\"", "authors": ["Danielle Kurtzleben"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/29/gettyimages-1176984629_wide-e8bc1ba868bedc5cc528dd11d4a0bc26f353b78f.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
