REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe proclamation repeated U.S. accusations that Iran sponsors terrorism, arbitrarily detains American citizens, threatens its neighbours and carries out cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cGiven that this behaviour threatens peace and stability in the Middle East and beyond, I have determined that it is in the interest of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or non-immigrants, of senior government officials of Iran, and their immediate family members,\u201d Trump said in the proclamation.\n\nThe U.S.-Iranian confrontation has ratcheted up since last year, when Trump withdrew from Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. Trump wants to go beyond that deal to further curb Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, halt its ballistic missile work and end its support for proxy forces in the Middle East.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani earlier said the United States would have to \u201cpay more\u201d if it wanted a wider deal and rejected meeting with the U.S. president for now. Both men were in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly gathering of world leaders.\n\nTrump has pursued a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against Iran to try to force Tehran to change its policies, and a senior U.S. official said it would continue to \u201cincrease pressure on the Iranian regime... until it abandons its outlaw behaviour.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, the Iranian regime has attacked, criticized, and aggressively worked against the United States,\u201d said the official. \u201cMeanwhile, hypocritical regime leaders and their family members have been exploiting our freedom and prosperity.\n\n\u201cThey come to America to go to our schools, seek jobs, enjoy our entertainment, and take in our culture,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding such \u201cofficials and their families don\u2019t deserve the privilege and luxury of coming to the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump gave the authority to decide who would be covered by the proclamation to the secretary of state.\n\nHe also provided exceptions, saying that among others the proclamation would not apply to lawful U.S. permanent residents, those granted asylum, or refugees already admitted to the United States. He also provided possible exceptions for people whose entry \u201cwould further important ... law enforcement objectives.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear if the proclamation would affect Iranian diplomats at the United Nations.\n\nUnder the 1947 U.N. \u201cheadquarters agreement\u201d, the United States is generally required to allow access to the United Nations for foreign diplomats. But Washington says it can deny visas for \u201csecurity, terrorism, and foreign policy\u201d reasons.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday took steps to bar senior Iranian officials and their immediate family from entering the United States as immigrants or non-immigrants, the White House said in a proclamation.", "authors": ["Arshad Mohammed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433995347&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O2DQ", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
