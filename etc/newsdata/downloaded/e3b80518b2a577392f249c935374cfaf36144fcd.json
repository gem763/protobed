But his austerity drive has left media outlets reeling, and raised questions about whether Lopez Obrador is trying to influence coverage.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador attends a news conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico, May 31, 2019.

REUTERS/Henry Romero/File Photo\n\nBetween January and August, Lopez Obrador\u2019s government spent 88 million pesos ($4.6 million) on advertising, just 3.6% of the sum spent in the same months of 2018 by his predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto, Public Administration Ministry (SFP) data show.\n\nThough such spending usually rises towards year-end, the eight-month outlay is the lowest in at least seven years, and well under budget. The reduction in government publicity, which had accounted for 10% or more of advertising revenue for many outlets, has sparked layoffs and the suspension of projects in an industry still suffering disruption from the shift to the internet.\n\nEveryone is feeling the pain, from regional newspapers, to marquee broadcasters such as Televisa and TV Azteca. Televisa\u2019s profit fell by 20% in the first quarter and by 79% in the second.\n\nWith the media desperate for funds, some critics fear the administration could lean on them for favourable coverage.\n\n\u201cIf the president\u2019s goal is to regulate the flow of investment in advertising, I would celebrate it,\u201d said Ruben Arnoldo Gonzalez, a media expert at Puebla\u2019s Benemerita Autonomous University. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the spending cuts are also a way to pressure the press.\u201d\n\nThe government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In news conferences this year, Lopez Obrador has denied his goal was to weaken the media.\n\nLopez Obrador\u2019s relationship with the media has long been rocky, and during the daily news conferences he has frequently attacked critical outlets such as newspaper Reforma, calling it an arm of the \u201cconservative\u201d opposition.\n\nNor has he hidden his preference for sympathetic voices.\n\n\u201cThe best journalists in Mexico\u2019s history ... all took sides,\u201d the president said in July.\n\nThe field appears to be thinning.\n\nThough there is no official figure for how many media operate in Mexico, the number of newspapers and magazines on the national register - those considered viable for government advertising - had by Sept. 25 fallen to 833 from 1,590 at the end of 2018, according to interior ministry data.\n\nQuantifying Lopez Obrador\u2019s impact on editorial independence is difficult, but the media are becoming friendlier to him, said Fernando Dworak, a Mexico City-based political analyst.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a loss of plurality, and we don\u2019t exactly know if it\u2019s due to financing, to public pressure or for their convenience,\u201d he said, noting it could be all of the above.\n\nWhat is clear, Dworak added, is that Lopez Obrador\u2019s 7 a.m. news conferences, which can last more than two hours, have made major media dedicate more air time to the government line.\n\nLatin America is no stranger to such situations.\n\nFormer Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori used cash to sway newspapers and television channels in his favour.\n\nIn Venezuela, almost three-quarters of newspapers closed by mid-2018 after five years of recession. A shortage of paper for printing presses and the government\u2019s refusal to renew TV and radio broadcasting licenses, has left coverage largely in the state\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cLESS IS MORE\u201d\n\nDuring its six-year term, the Pena Nieto administration purchased some $2.5 billion in advertising, favouring big contracts with media conglomerates Televisa and TV Azteca.\n\nLopez Obrador budgeted for around $250 million in advertising this year, compared with $485 million spent by Pena Nieto in 2018, according to SFP figures.\n\n\u201cWe care about keeping spending down,\u201d Lopez Obrador said this month. \u201cWe need moderation, because less is more.\u201d\n\nMexican media\u2019s steady flow of government funds has long insulated them from changing times, according to a report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\n\n\u201cThe new political arrangements are having repercussions on the news media, which have become accustomed to having the government as their principal advertiser,\u201d the report said.\n\nTelevisa, which Lopez Obrador accused of complicity in an establishment plot to deny him the presidency in 2006, for years was an ally of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated Mexico for most of the past century.\n\nHeaded by tycoon Emilio Azcarraga, the company said its second quarter drop in income was partly due to lower government spending on advertising. In 2018, the final year of Pena Nieto\u2019s PRI administration, government spending on advertising made up 11% of Televisa\u2019s total advertising revenue.\n\nThe story is virtually the same at other media firms.\n\nTV Azteca\u2019s sales plummeted 29% in the second quarter and its stock is trading near a historic low, while Grupo Radio Centro suffered a 24% drop in sales and its shares are hovering around a 15-year low.\n\nMedia have cut back on coverage, laid off employees and sometimes found themselves unable to pay workers.\n\n\u201cIt was very frustrating for all of us,\u201d said Margarita Vega, who in mid-April lost her job as a script writer at El Financiero Bloomberg TV. \u201cThey asked me to stop what I was writing. My anchor cried, I will never forget it.\u201d", "description": "Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December promising to reduce public spending to free up more resources for the poor.
