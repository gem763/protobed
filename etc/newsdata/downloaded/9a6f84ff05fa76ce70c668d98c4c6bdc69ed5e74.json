India has also said it had not made a decision regarding the company.\n\nGetty A launch event last spring in London for the Huawei P30 Pro.\n\nOver the past year, the U.S. has mounted a campaign to convince allies to ban Huawei from involvement in their mobile infrastructures. Australia and New Zealand have effectively banned Huawei from their 5G networks, while in August the U.S. Commerce Department issued a temporary reprieve for certain companies to engage in limited transactions with the telecom giant, \u201cto afford consumers across America the necessary time to transition away from Huawei equipment, given the persistent national security and foreign policy threat.\u201d\n\nThe 90-day extension mostly covers mobile-phone and broadband components, not network infrastructure.\n\nSee (July 29, 2019): Trump reverses Huawei ban as U.S.-China trade negotiations restart\n\nAnd (May 17, 2019): Trump\u2019s economic sanctions on Huawei could backfire on the U.S.\n\nChina and Huawei both deny the company poses any national-security risk.\n\nCanada and the U.K., meanwhile, said they will make decisions regarding Huawei in the coming months, though London said it had already decided to exclude the company from its government networks.\n\nCanada is in the midst of turbulent relations with Beijing, after arresting Huawei\u2019s CFO in December at Washington\u2019s request, which accuses her of violating sanctions against Iran, charges the company denies.\n\nSoon after, China arrested two Canadians \u2014 seen by many as retaliation \u2014 and observers said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may delay the decision until their cases are resolved.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has sought to convince allies of the risks involved in working with Huawei, China has warned several countries about repercussions for blocking the company from their markets.\n\nBut experts predict Ottawa will eventually decide to block the company.\n\n\u201cI think a ban is likely,\u201d Richard Fadden, a former national-security adviser to Trudeau, told Bloomberg earlier this year.\n\nRelated: China fires back after Trudeau rips death sentence given Canadian in drug-smuggling case\n\nWhile the Trump administration has sought to convince allies of the risks involved in working with Huawei, China has warned several countries about blocking the company from their markets.
