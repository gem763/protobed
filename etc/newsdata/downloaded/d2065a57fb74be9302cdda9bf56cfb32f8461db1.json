You may be surprised that his data point to the last dozen years as being an anomaly \u2014 value strategies have beaten growth over very long periods.\n\nIf you expect the outperformance of growth stocks to continue, you may be interested in this interview with Justin White, the manager of the T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund PRWAX, +0.64%.\n\nGetting back to value, Hulbert compared the recent performance of the S&P 500 Value Index against that of the S&P 500 Growth Index. These are overlapping subsets of the benchmark S&P 500 SPX, +0.13%. Here\u2019s how all three indexes have performed during September.\n\nFactSet\n\nThe S&P 500 Value Index is made up of 382 stocks, drawn from the S&P 500 by S&P Dow Jones Indices, based on price-to-book-value, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios.\n\nThese ETFs track the S&P 500 Value Index:\n\n\u2022 SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF SPYV, +0.37% \u2014 annual expenses are 0.04% of assets.\n\n\u2022 Vanguard S&P 500 Value ETF VOOV, +0.33% \u2014 expense ratio: 0.15%.\n\n\u2022 iShares S&P 500 Value ETF IVE, +0.36% \u2014 expense ratio: 0.18%.\n\n\u2022 The Invesco S&P 500 Enhanced Value ETF IVE, +0.36% takes a more \u201daggressive\u201d approach to value, concentrating the portfolio in 100 stocks among the S&P 500 with the highest value scores. Its expense ratio is 0.13%.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 favorite value stocks\n\nAmong stocks in the S&P 500 Value Index, Apple AAPL, +0.40% has, by far, the heaviest weighting, making up 8.7% of SPYV. But Apple doesn\u2019t make the list below, as only 52% of analysts polled by FactSet rate the shares a \u201cbuy\u201d or the equivalent. The next largest holding is J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.25%, with 44% \u201cbuy\u201d ratings, and the third is AT&T T, -0.07%, which also has 44% \u201cbuy\u201d ratings.\n\nHere are the 20 stocks in the S&P 500 Value Index with the highest percentage of \u201cbuy\u201d or equivalent ratings among analysts polled by FactSet:\n\nYou can click the tickers for more about each company.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How to identify U.S. stocks with attractive growth potential\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "There are signs that the 12-year period of growth strategies beating value is coming to an end.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT755_Mondel_ZG_20191022090159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
