Those cells, if they are going to survive, need to find a way to adapt to that level of oxygen,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ALMOST SPEECHLESS\"\n\nMedicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes given each year. The prizes for achievements in science, peace and literature have been awarded since 1901 and were created in the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.\n\nNobel medicine laureates have included scientific greats such as Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, and Karl Landsteiner, who identified separate blood types and so enabled safe transfusions to be widely introduced. Perlmann said he had reached Kaelin by phone early on Monday, after first having dialled the wrong number.\n\n\"He was really happy, almost speechless,\" Perlmann said.\n\nRatcliffe was at his office and Semenza was asleep, he said.\n\nLast year American James Allison and Japanese Tasuku Honjo won the prize for discoveries about how to harness the immune system in cancer therapies.\n\n(Reporting by Niklas Pollard, Simon Johnson, Anna Ringstrom, Johannes Hellstrom, Johan Ahlander, Colm Fulton and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm; Writing and additional reporting by Kate Kelland in London, Editing by Timothy Heritage)", "description": "STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Two Americans and a Briton won the 2019 Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday for discovering a molecular switch that regulates how cells adapt to fluctuating oxygen levels, opening up new approaches to treating heart failure, anaemia and cancer.
