With howling winds sweeping toward the coastline and desert-like low humidity gripping the state, the Kincade fire in Northern California grew to 76,825 acres on Wednesday morning, while firefighters in the southern part of the state battled the Getty and Easy fires, which threaten thousands of homes, businesses \u2014 and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nFaced with conditions optimal for wildfires, public power utility companies Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison have been forced to power down their transmission lines, cutting electricity service to millions of customers. Despite cutting power a week ago to portions of Sonoma County, PG&E says a downed wire may have started the Kincade fire.\n\nAll across California, residents are struggling to come to terms with what is being called the \u201cnew normal\u201d for the state, in which the final months of the dry season are marked by wildfires that spread faster than seems possible, destroying thousands of homes and structures and blanketing large portions of the state with toxic smoke.\n\nWhile there is no single cause for the perennial infernos that now occur in the Golden State, there are notable factors that are making them worse.\n\nA scene from the Getty fire in Los Angeles.

Hotter temperatures dry out forest vegetation. According to data from NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, average summer temperatures have risen by 3.25 degrees Fahrenheit since 1896, the San Jose Mercury News reported. The 10 hottest years on record have also occurred since 1998. Climate change is also blamed for insect infestations that have contributed to killing millions of trees, which in turn present a heightened burn risk. There were an estimated 150 million dead trees in California in 2018. In 2013, that number was just 6.5 million, data from Cal Fires shows.\n\nSeasonal weather patterns\n\nWildfires are part of the history of the western United States in part because seasonal weather patterns bring dry conditions to states like California throughout the summer. Making matters worse, in October high pressure systems often park themselves over Nevada\u2019s Great Basin, directing arid winds clockwise toward the Sierra Nevada. In Northern California, that weather pattern causes what are called \u201cDiablo winds,\u201d which this year brought gusts of over 90 miles per hour, fanning the Kincade fire. Southern California\u2019s famous Santa Ana winds are part of the same phenomenon, and Tuesday\u2019s gusts topping 70 miles per hour were coupled with single-digit humidity. Barring drought, California\u2019s rainy season usually starts in late October and can extend through April.\n\nA chimney is all that's left of a home leveled by the Kincade fire in Calistoga, Calif.

The company declared bankruptcy in January in part because of the $30 billion in damages it owes victims of previous wildfires ignited by the company\u2019s aging infrastructure. By preemptively shutting down power to millions of customers in October, the company acknowledged that its equipment posed a danger. But long-term fixes aren\u2019t simple. The state has approximately 26,000 miles of high-tension transmission lines and 24,000 miles of lower-voltage ones, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Burying them underground, where they would be safe from winds and falling trees, would take years and cost an average of $2.3 million per mile.", "description": "While there is no single cause for the perennial infernos that now occur in the Golden State, there are notable factors that are making them worse.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zGL1et2.k6krPxMSxJ6tOA--~B/aD0xNjU1O3c9MjUxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/bbb94ef0-fb50-11e9-bdce-66ccf5fd59a2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
