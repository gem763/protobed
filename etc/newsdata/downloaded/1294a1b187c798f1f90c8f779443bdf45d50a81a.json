Over the weekend, The New York Times reported that president Donald Trump had recently dreamed up a meeting with Taliban leadership at Camp David, the presidential retreat famous for being the background of international negotiation, but ultimately cancelled it after the group killed an American soldier just before the proposed meeting.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The president then tweeted about the decision to cancel the meeting, placing the blame on Taliban leadership, who, according to the New York Times, had never fully accepted the invitation to Camp David.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
