Gary Peters, a Democrat, ended up winning that election by a mere 6,504 votes out of 245,055.\n\nCrowe reports that a state branch of American Rising is demanding a thorough inquiry into how many elections Hawkins may have impacted if the allegations are true.\n\n\"The charges against Ms. Hawkins are extremely troubling and must be fully investigated. The integrity of our elections is essential to the protection of our constitutional rights and individual liberty. Michigan Rising Action is calling for a full audit of every election that Ms. Hawkins oversaw in her capacity as an elections official,\u201d Tori Sachs told National Review.\n\nAs Regnery's Eric Eggers will tell you, this sort of election meddling is just one of many tricks the left will use to steal the next election.
