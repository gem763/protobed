The merger would create the Gulf South\u2019s largest and most comprehensive health provider, according to a news release. Ochsner says it owns, manages or is affiliated with 40 hospitals and 115.\n\n\u201cPatients will continue to have access to the same services and physicians they know today,\u201d Dr. John Schutte, a member of the Lafayette General Health Board of Trustees and an orthopedic surgeon, said. \u201cOur aim is to enhance and expand services for Southwest Louisiana, so that people in Acadiana do not have to leave the area for services. We will work to expand sub-specialty care, especially in pediatrics and oncology,\u201d\n\nBoth systems will now check each other out more thoroughly and seek regulatory approval. Officials expect final approvals in the spring.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Lafayette General will be the health system\u2019s regional hub for southwest Louisiana and Ochsner will invest $365 million in capital and resources in Acadiana over the next 10 years.\n\nIn addition, the 800 Lafayette General employees getting minimum pay will see their hourly rate go up $2 to $12.\n\nCommitments include investing more than $50 million in expanding key services including pediatrics, women\u2019s health and cancer services, and bringing in new behavioral health services.\n\nOfficials said the partnership will mean more financial stability for University Hospital & Clinics, so it can continue serving vulnerable members of the community. It also will create a 10-year, $10 million Community Support Fund overseen by the Lafayette General Board to advance health and wellness in Acadiana.\n\nThe system will also add about 48 residency positions at Lafayette General Medical Center, adding to 75 there and at University Hospital and Clinics, officials said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two Louisiana hospital systems are proposing a merger.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
