Research has repeatedly shown that it is prone to significant racial and gender bias, which is troubling enough even before factoring in that federal immigration authorities have been routinely accused of violating fundamental aspects of human rights law.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s administration has also tried to fast-track deportations with less due process than ever, and there have been numerous instances of federal immigration authorities deporting legal immigrants who committed crimes decades ago. In some cases, people have been deported after being misidentified, despite (or perhaps enabled by) use of biometrics like fingerprints.\n\nThe White House has also been repeatedly set back in court in its efforts to force through expansions of power that would enable it to be crueler to immigrants and refugees. (One of its key immigration architects, Steven Miller, has every appearance of being a thinly veiled white \u201cnationalist.\u201d)\n\nMeanwhile, FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have already been scanning millions of Americans\u2019 state drivers\u2019 licenses with almost no oversight. As Gizmodo has previously reported, the \u201cdeeply flawed and intrinsically biased\u201d technology is already in wide deployment with state and local police, who have sometimes concealed its use from criminal defendants.\n\n\u201cBuilding a system with the potential to arbitrarily scan and identify individuals without any criminal suspicion and discover personal information about their location, interests or activities, can and should simply be banned by law,\u201d University of the District of Columbia Andrew Ferguson told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform earlier this year.\n\nIt is not hard to see how face recognition could perpetuate racial profiling at the border, and more generally the longstanding U.S. government deportation machine, on a massive scale. That\u2019s not even counting a recent data breach in which hackers stole an undisclosed number of licence-plate images and ID photos from a CBP subcontractor.\n\n\u201cBody cameras were promised to communities as a tool for officer accountability and should not be twisted into surveillance systems to be used against communities,\u201d ACLU senior counsel Chris Rickerd told Reuters.\n\n[Reuters]", "description": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2014one of the arms of the federal immigration machine shoving tens of thousands of people into de facto concentration camps\u2014is eyeing equipping officers with facial recognition body cams, according to Reuters....", "authors": ["George Dvorsky", "David Nield"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wqvhgql8jtp2nzcnitux.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
