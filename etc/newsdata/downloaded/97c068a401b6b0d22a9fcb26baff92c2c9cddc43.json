'He is Yoda,' Neumann said. 'He has the Force with him.'\n\nMasayoshi Son, 62, is the mastermind of SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, which has invested $10.7 billion in WeWork and is taking over the co-working company\n\nNeumann and his wife, Rebekah, call Son 'Yoda,' a reference to the Star Wars character\n\nPeople walk past a SoftBank mobile phone store in Tokyo in September. The diversified holding company has become a major investment player in Silicon Valley\n\nEthnically Korean, Son was born in a small town on Japan's southern island Kyushu, where his grandparents had migrated from South Korea seeking work.\n\nSon moved to California at age 16, and studied economics and computer science at US Berkeley.\n\nHe founded SoftBank in 1981 at the age of 24, originally as a computer parts store in Japan, and rapidly expanded into publishing, telecommunications, and investing.\n\nIn the 1990s, he became an early investor in internet companies, buying stakes in Yahoo! and Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba.\n\nThough he lost an estimated $70 billion in the dot-com crash, he remains the second richest man in Japan, with an estimated net worth of $19 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHe has splashed out some of his fortune on properties around the world, including a palatial estate that is among the most expensive properties ever sold in California.\n\nSoftBank President Masayoshi Son (left) is seen at a Tokyo press conference in 1996\n\nMasayoshi Son holds free computer game software during a 2003 press conference in Tokyo\n\nSon bought this nine-acre estate in Woodside for a record-shattering $117.5 million in 2012\n\nIn 2012, he snapped up the nine-acre estate in Woodside for a record-shattering $117.5 million.\n\nAnd in 2013, Son purchased Tokyo's landmark Tiffany Building for $326 million, one of the priciest property deals in recent years in Japan.\n\nSoftBank booked $81 billion in 2017 revenue, and has become known as a major Silicon Valley investment player with an unorthodox investment style.\n\nWhere most venture capitalists spread their bets around many startups with small, early investments, adding in further money as the companies grow, SoftBank is known for making massive, late-stage investments in the very final stages before a company goes public.\n\nSoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund has invested $71.4 billion in 83 firms, recording $20.2 billion in investment gains (though mostly on paper) and distributing $6.4 billion to its investors as at the end of June.\n\nSoftBank's massive $100 billion Vision Fund has invested $71.4 billion in 83 firms\n\nThe fund's largest investments include:\n\n$11.8 billion in Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing\n\n$10.7 billion in U.S.-based office sharing startup WeWork parent The We Company (total includes SoftBank Group investment)\n\n$7.7 billion in U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc\n\n$3 billion in Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab\n\n$3 billion in South Korean e-commerce firm Coupang\n\nThe IPO flop of WeWork, one of its biggest bets, and plunging valuations of other major investments such as ride-hailing pioneer Uber have cast a cloud over the Son's efforts to raise a second $100 billion Vision Fund.\n\nSon said earlier this month that he is 'embarrassed and flustered' by his track record in an interview with Nikkei Business magazine.\n\n'When I look at the growth of U.S. and Chinese companies, I feel strongly it's not good enough,' Son said.\n\nNevertheless, he felt that time would vindicate SoftBank's investment strategy.\n\n'Companies like WeWork and Uber are criticised for being in the red, but in 10 years they'll be making substantial profits,' Son said.\n\nSon led the revolt against WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann, who was criticized for his hard partying ways and level of control over the company, culminating in him stepping down as CEO.\n\n'Recently I have been telling founders to 'know your limit'', Son said.\n\nWeWork chairman Adam Neumann (pictured in May 2017) could be paid roughly $1.7B to forfeit control of the company he founded should it be purchased by SoftBank, insiders say\n\nSon led the revolt against WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann, who was criticized for his hard partying ways and level of control over the company\n\nUntil Tuesday's takeover deal, Neumann remained WeWork's chairman and largest individual shareholder, with special voting rights that gave him total control over the company.\n\nSoftBank's package to induce Neumann to cede control reportedly included a $1 billion stock buyout, $500 million line of credit, and $185 million 'consulting fee.'\n\nSoftBank will spend an additional $2 billion to cash out other WeWork investors and employees of their equity in the company \u2014 an amount that is far from the payday that staff had dreamed of when the company announced plans for its now-cancelled IPO in August.\n\nThe deal values the company at $8 billion, down from the $47 billion that SoftBank's January investment pegged the company at.", "description": "Masayoshi Son, 62, is the mastermind of SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, which has invested\u00a0$10.7 billion in WeWork - most recently at at $47 billion valuation in January.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20044952-0-image-a-5_1571762916782.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
