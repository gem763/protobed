The BGB said it recovered 70,000 methamphetamine tablets, known locally as Yaba, along with a rifle and bullets, from the bodies.\n\nIqbal Hossain, additional police superintendent in the Cox's Bazar district, said that 44 Rohingya have been killed in gunfights with law enforcement agencies from January to date.\n\n\"All of them were engaged with drug peddling, robbery, human trafficking and arms trade,\" Hossain told Reuters.\n\n\"In recent months a section of Rohingya are getting involved in crimes and out of them some were killed in gunfights with law enforcement agencies.\"\n\nProdeep Kumar Das, officer in charge of Teknaf police station, told Reuters that several police officers have been injured in gun battles with refugees.\n\nRohingya rights groups say they want the killings investigated.\n\n\"We don't support any criminal activities, but we cannot accept such killing. We demand thorough investigations of all such killings,\" said Syed Ullah, general secretary of Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights of Kutupalong camp in Teknaf.\n\n\"Rohingyas can not do it without the support and help from local people.\"\n\n(Reporting by Mohammad Nurul Islam in Cox's Bazar; Writing by Serajul Quadir; Editing by Alasdair Pal and Raissa Kasolowsky)", "description": "Cox's Bazar, BANGLADESH (Reuters) - Two Rohingya refugees were killed in a gun battle with Bangladeshi border guards as they tried to cross into Bangladesh from Myanmar on Friday, officials said.", "authors": ["Mohammad Nurul Islam"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
