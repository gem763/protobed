If an agreement is not possible, he says he will lead the United Kingdom out of the club it joined in 1973 without a deal - even though parliament has passed a law saying he cannot do so.\n\nBut current EU president Finland said more time was needed and that negotiations could continue even after the EU summit.\n\n\u201cI think there is no time in a practical or legal way to find an agreement before the EU Council meeting,\u201d Prime Minister Antti Rinne said after talks with the next chair of EU summits, Charles Michel. \u201cWe need more time and we need to have negotiations after the (European) Council meeting.\u201d\n\nSome EU politicians such as Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a deal was possible with more work. But EU diplomats were pessimistic about the chances of Johnson\u2019s hybrid customs proposal for the Irish border riddle.\n\n\u201cWe are not very optimistic,\u201d a senior EU diplomat told Reuters.\n\nAfter more than three years of Brexit crisis that has claimed the scalps of two British prime ministers, Johnson will have to ratify any last-minute deal in parliament, which will hold its first Saturday sitting since the 1982 Falklands War.\n\nAs EU ministers met in Luxembourg ahead of the leaders\u2019 summit, Johnson\u2019s planned legislative agenda was read out by Queen Elizabeth at the state opening of parliament.\n\nIf he is unable to clinch a deal, an acrimonious divorce could follow that would divide the West, roil financial markets and test the cohesion of the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not wait - we can\u2019t wait: let\u2019s get Brexit done,\u201d Johnson told parliament. \u201cIf there could be one thing more divisive, more toxic than the first referendum, it be would be a second referendum.\u201d\n\nThe pound fell more than 1% to a session low of $1.2517 GBP=D3. Against the euro, the British currency weakened by a similar margin to 88.11 pence EURGBP=D3.\n\nThe main sticking point remains the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland: how to prevent it becoming a backdoor into the EU after Brexit without erecting controls that could undermine the 1998 peace agreement that largely ended three decades of sectarian violence.\n\nBREXIT HANGS IN BALANCE\n\nTo get a deal done, Johnson must master the complexities of the Irish border before getting the approval of Europe\u2019s biggest powers and then sell any deal to the parliament in which he has no majority and which he suspended unlawfully last month.\n\n\u201cJohnson doesn\u2019t have a majority for anything in parliament,\u201d one EU official told Reuters.\n\nThe details of Johnson\u2019s proposals have not been published but are essentially a compromise in which Northern Ireland is formally in the United Kingdom\u2019s customs union but also informally in the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nBut the EU is worried it would be impossible to ensure goods entering Northern Ireland do not end up in the bloc and is concerned about the complexity of a system for charging tariffs on goods moved between Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cSuch a hybrid customs territory like the British are proposing for Northern Ireland does not work anywhere in the world, it seems,\u201d an EU diplomat said.\n\n\u201cWith this kind of system, with two sets of rules for the same goods crossing the same border, there is more possibility for fraud and it\u2019s extremely complicated to distinguish between goods heading for Northern Ireland, or further to Ireland and the single market.\u201d\n\nIn a sign that optimism which followed Johnson\u2019s meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar last week may have been premature, EU diplomats now say the best chance of a deal would be to keep Northern Ireland in the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nThat would be a step too far for Johnson\u2019s Northern Irish allies, the Democratic Unionist Party, and many Brexit supporters in his party.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nIf he fails to strike a deal with the EU, a law passed by parliament obliges him to seek a delay - the scenario EU diplomats think is most likely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the Brits to decide if they will ask for an extension,\u201d European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said in an interview with Austrian media outlet Kurier.\n\nExtension options range from as short as an extra month to half a year or longer. The other EU states would need to agree unanimously to grant it.", "description": "A deal to smooth Britain's departure from the European Union hung in the balance on Monday after diplomats indicated the bloc wanted more concessions from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and said a full agreement was unlikely this week.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440863142&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1UD", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
