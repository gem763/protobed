He pointed to aid withheld from Central American countries to force changes in immigration policies.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is spearheading the impeachment inquiry, said \u201cthings have just gone from very, very bad to much, much worse\u201d for the president.\n\n\u201cThe idea that vital military assistance would be withheld for such a patently political reason is a phenomenal breach of the president\u2019s duty to defend our national security,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cI hope every member, Democrat and Republican, will speak out and condemn this illicit action by the president and his chief of staff.\u201d\n\nMr. Mulvaney later walked back his remarks and said the news media misconstrued them to further their \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about the lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, who was on a trip to Texas, said he didn\u2019t see Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s press conference but heard good things.\n\n\u201cMick is a good man. I have a lot of confidence in him,\u201d the president said.\n\nMr. Mulvaney\u2019s remarks at the White House were the closest an administration official has come to describing a quid pro quo for a Ukrainian investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry stemmed from a whistleblower complaint that Mr. Trump abused his power by trying to force the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden, who is a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nA quid pro quo is the linchpin of the abuse of power case against Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Mulvaney stoked a celebratory mood among congressional Democrats after widespread reporting that an ally of Mr. Trump provided damning testimony in a closed-door interview with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nGordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, said he objected to the role of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, in negotiations with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI did not understand until much later that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign,\u201d he said, according to the prepared remarks.\n\nThe description does not support the claims about military aid. Mr. Sondland also shot down all of the allegations that he was involved in any intrigue to strong-arm Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cSondland\u2019s opening statement throws Giuliani and the president under the bus,\u201d said Rep. Ted Lieu, California Democrat. \u201cWhat he says is absolutely not helpful to the president.\u201d\n\nRep. Gerald E. Connolly, Virginia Democrat, didn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cHe did not break with Trump,\u201d Mr. Connolly said.\n\nDemocrats now are eyeing Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Giuliani to testify before the committees conducting the impeachment probe.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican, declined to comment on Mr. Mulvaney. Instead, he dismissed reports about advances by the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe key today is every single witness, every single fact has not supported any pause or holdup on foreign aid being attached to any conditions \u2014 and that has been consistent with every word we\u2019ve heard from so far,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the press conference, Mr. Mulvaney mentioned the Justice Department investigation into the missing Democratic National Committee server from the 2016 race. In his later statement, he said the military aid was not tied to the search for the DNC server.\n\nThe server was hacked by Russians, and a trove of embarrassing emails was stolen and then published by WikiLeaks.\n\nAn American cybersecurity company called CrowdStrike examined the server to probe the leaks. The server was supposed to be turned over to the FBI but disappeared. It is not clear why the Trump administration believes the server is in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in [the] past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said at the press conference. \u201cNo question about that. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said Mr. Mulvaney \u201cco-signed the president\u2019s confession.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a confession from the president,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell, California Democrat. \u201cWhen a suspect confesses, you can reduce the number of witnesses you need to call, still give them a fair process, but you know kind of circling in on the timeline and who did what when.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
