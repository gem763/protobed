Sharon has come down with a case of the Jailhouse Rocks.\n\nShe looks fabulous (Picture: Rob Latour/REX)\n\nAt least the snarl is gone (Picture: The Kelly Clarkson Show)\n\nThe former X Factor judge has had more than a facelift over the summer.\n\nShe revealed her plans for a \u2018new face\u2019 in May on The Talk, telling Eve, Carrie Ann Inaba, Sheryl Underwood and Rumor Willis that her surgery had been booked.\n\n\u2018It was five weeks today that I had my operation,\u2019 she said when she returned to the chat show. \u2018I had my neck done, my jowls\u2026 He kind of pulled it from the top of my head and put an elastic band in it. But everything was just lifted up. So it looks more refreshed.\n\n\u2018I feel okay. Still a little bit of pain. But you can\u2019t complain when you wanted to do it.\u2019\n\nHer daughter Kelly Osbourne even accompanied her to the procedure and (as you would) became worried about her after the surgery.\n\nThe music manager continued: \u2018When I woke up, [Kelly] told me that I was going, \u201cHelp me, help me!\u201d\n\n\u2018And she\u2019s like, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cJust help me\u201d \u2026 I don\u2019t know what I wanted help for!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever anaesthetics made her panic so much, let us know so we can steer clear of it.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
