If their name is Stefanie Germanotta the answer is get into Fortnite, of course! The artist known as Lady Gaga has spent the past few days asking Twitter about Fortnite, the online video game that is ridiculously popular with teenage boys. On Tuesday afternoon, Gaga took to Twitter to ask her 79.8 million little monsters \u201cWhat\u2019s fortnight?\u201d While she (intentionally?) misspelled the name of the game, the real meaning of her question was not lost to the public. The tweet racked up an astounding 894.6 thousand likes and a cheeky reply from Fortnite aficionado and gaming celebrity, Ninja. Naturally, Gaga followed up and returned to Twitter the next day to pose a very important question that was probably on the minds of most people following the thread over the age of 25: \u201c. @Ninja who are you?\u201d\n\nWhile Gaga\u2019s Twitter activity the last few days might be best described as odd, her Instagram activity has been down right cooky by comparison. On Wednesday evening, Gaga posted on Instagram to wish her dear friend Drake happy birthday. While on the surface this might seem like normal, perhaps even basic Instagram behavior, Gaga wished Drake happy birthday on October 16th, 8 full days before he actually was born on October 24th, 1986 leaving fans of both Gaga and Drake scratching their heads.\n\nlady gaga confusing the entire internet (2019) pic.twitter.com/QmbH2VNy0a \u2014 gong (@gagasdarksin) October 16, 2019\n\nAs of now, the reasoning behind Gaga\u2019s Fortnite tweets and the Drake birthday post remain unclear. Is Gaga specifically courting Gen Z with the release of her incredibly anticipated next album that may or may not be titled ADELE? Does she not know or simply not care about the specific date Drake was born? Is wishing your friend a happy birthday 8 calendar days before the date of their actual birth some kind of weird celebrity inside joke that we commoners are not privy to? Surely some of these questions will be answered as the rollout to LG6 continues, but until then our best guess is that Gaga lost a bet in her secret celebrity Fortnite league comprised of herself, Adele, and Champagne Papi.", "description": "Lady Gaga tweets about Fortnite and gets a response from Youtube streamer Ninja and then wishes Drake a happy birthday via Instagram on the wrong day.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/16-Lady-Gaga.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
