Patience is a virtue.\"\n\nImage copyright Paul Gregory Image caption Kingfishers are usually pictured while perching\n\nMr Sexton said most pictures of kingfishers, which hunt for minnows and sticklebacks in shallow pools of water, show them perching.\n\n\"Action shots like this don't happen that often,\" he said. \"It's a real top quality [picture] and a one in a million shot.\"\n\nIn 2016, Attenborough Nature Reserve was voted as one of the best places to see the birds by BBC Wildlife magazine.\n\nImage copyright Amanda Sinclair Image caption The kingfisher was spotted at Attenborough Nature Reserve's Delta pond\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
