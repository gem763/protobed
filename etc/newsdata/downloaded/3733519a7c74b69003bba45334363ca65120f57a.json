Never hurt.\n\nTwo to six months, Cecil.\n\nI\u2019ll be right, he boomed\n\nto his poor sister on the phone\n\nI\u2019ll do that when I finish dyin.\n\n*****\n\nDon\u2019t die, Cecil.\n\nBut they do.\n\nGoing for last drives\n\nin the bush, odd massive\n\nboard-slotted stumps bony white\n\nin whipstick second growth.\n\nI could chop all day.\n\nI could always cash\n\na cheque, in Sydney or anywhere.\n\nAny of the shops.\n\nEating, still at the head\n\nof the table, he now missed\n\nfood on his knife side.\n\nSorry, Dad, but like\n\nhave you forgiven your enemies?\n\nYour father and all of them?\n\nAll his lifetime of hurt.\n\nI must have (grin). I don\u2019t\n\nthink about that now.\n\n*****\n\nPeople can\u2019t say goodbye\n\nany more. They say last hellos.\n\nGoing fast, over Christmas,\n\nhe\u2019d still stumble out\n\nof his room, where his photos\n\nhang over the other furniture,\n\nand play host to his mourners.\n\nThe courage of his bluster\n\nfirm big voice of his confusion.\n\nTwo last days in the hospital:\n\nhis long forearms were still\n\nred mahogany. His hands\n\ngripped steel frame. I\u2019m dyin.\n\nOn the second day:\n\nYou\u2019re bustin to talk but\n\nI\u2019m too busy dyin.\n\n*****\n\nGrief ended when he died,\n\nthe widower like soldiers who\n\nwon\u2019t live life their mates missed.\n\nGood boy Cecil! No more Bluey dog.\n\nNo more cowtime. No more stories.\n\nWe\u2019re still using your imagination,\n\nit was stronger than all ours.\n\nYour grave\u2019s got littler\n\nsomehow, in the three months.\n\nMore pointy as the clay\u2019s shrivelled,\n\nlike a stuck zip in a coat.\n\nYour cricket boots are in\n\nthe State museum! Odd letters\n\nstill come. Two more\u2019s died since you:\n\nAnnie, and Stewart. Old Stewart.\n\nOn your day there was a good crowd,\n\nfamily, and people from away.\n\nBut of course a lot had gone\n\nto their own funerals first.\n\nSnobs mind us off religion\n\nnowadays, if they can.\n\nFuck th\u00e9m. I wish you God.", "description": "This last year he was wandery:\ntook off a new chainsaw blade\nand cobbled a spare from bits.\nPerhaps if I lay down\nmy head\u2019ll come better again.\nHis left shoulder kept rising\nhigher in his cardigan\u2026", "authors": ["Tania Sheko"], "top_image": "https://miro.medium.com/max/498/1*29EQ5YGmejl_O4rXZSwM3w.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-04-30"}
