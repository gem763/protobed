The Ultimaker S3, which goes for $4,395, is designed to deliver composite-ready performance with a small desktop printer footprint. 3D printing is increasingly being adopted in manufacturing.\n\nUltimaker S3 is smaller than the Ultimaker S5, which launched in April and is designed for more industrial use. The Ultimaker S3 can print nearly any 2.85 mm filament and product models and custom parts. The 3D printing system also uses Ultimaker's software platform and interface as well as automation tools that pause jobs when materials run thin.\n\nIn addition, Ultimaker launched the Ultimaker S5 Pro Bundle, which gives manufacturers automated workflows so systems can run unattended 24/7. Ultimaker S5 Pro Bundle costs $9,100 and is available Oct. 18.\n\nBest 3D printers for small businesses on Amazon Business | Stratasys' MakerBot launches Method X, a 3D printing workstation | Smile DirectClub to become largest deployment of HP Multi Jet Fusion 3D printers in US | Carbon raises $260 million to grow its digital manufacturing platform | How Heineken is using 3D printing for on-demand brewery parts\n\nThe company's Ultimaker S5 Pro Bundle includes the Ultimaker S5, Ultimaker S5 Air Manager and Ultimaker S5 Material Station as an integrated system.
