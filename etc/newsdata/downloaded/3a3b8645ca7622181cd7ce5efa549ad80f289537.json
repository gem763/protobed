Its ecosystem didn\u2019t work remotely. \u201cWe see a very strong indication that where you\u2019re located does matter\u2026 come to Silicon Valley,\u201d intoned Joe Kraus of Google Ventures at the first Disrupt conference I ever intended, speaking for essentially all VCs, including Y Combinator.\n\nEasy enough if you\u2019re American. Much, much trickier if you need a visa to get there. Is it still true that the Valley doesn\u2019t work remotely? Or is there another path for startups from faraway countries these days? Last week I sat down with Alexis Ohanian in his ancestral homeland of Armenia to discuss this.\n\nEvery nation seems to have its own set of incubators and seed investors these days. Armenia is no exception: I met Ohanian at the launch event for Aybuben Ventures, a VC fund \u201cfor Armenia and The Armenians.\u201d (As I wrote last week, the Armenian diaspora is a big deal.) But what happens next, when you need to raise a serious Series A, but your local market realistically isn\u2019t big enough to support your company?\n\nEven five years ago you would have had a lot of trouble tapping into the Valley. Since then, though, things have changed. The price of Bay Area talent \u2014 and real estate \u2014 has led to the rise of \u201cmullet startups,\u201d as coined by Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s Andrew Chen. Such comapnies have their headquarters in the Bay to take advantage of the Valley, but their tech teams somewhere cheaper and more spacious. \u201cBusiness up front, party out back.\u201d\n\nOhanian\u2019s point is that there\u2019s no reason the mullet model can\u2019t work backwards: launch a company with a strong tech team in some remote location, then, when you hit the inflection point, open a Bay Area office, move the executive team there, and turn yourself into a mullet startup. (Aided by the fact that if coming as a company, your visa options widen to include e.g. the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa.) Call it the \u201creverse mullet,\u201d exemplified by e.g. PicsArt.\n\nThis model is especially viable for nations which have deep engineering / tech talent, so that the \u201cparty out back\u201d tech team becomes an ongoing competitive advantage. (This is part of why Ohanian keeps hammering home the importance of learning to code during his visits to Armenia, something which is probably easier in a nation which already features compulsory chess education.) All of which sounds great in theory \u2014\n\n\u2014 but it\u2019s not like we see a herd of unicorns with reverse mullets out there \u2026 yet. If we do, though, that will be an exceptionally interesting new growth model, with significant ramifications \u2014 a way for Silicon Valley to essentially metastasize to the rest of the world. This in turn will, ironically, reify its primacy as the center of the global tech industry, the sun around which all the faraway planets orbit, after so many prophecies of decentralization. Count the reverse mullet unicorns in three years, and if there are more than a mere few, we\u2019ll know the answer.", "description": "For many years the allure of Silicon Valley was contingent on the ability to move here.
