Apple held the top spot on Moosylvania\u2019s top 100 list for six years and is being overshadowed by Amazon for the first time, the company recently announced.\n\nApple landed in the second spot this year, with Nike placing in third, Walmart taking the fourth spot, and Target ranking in fifth. The survey was based on responses from 1,000 millennials. Other tech giants, Samsung and Google, placed in sixth and seventh respectively. Millennials are defined by the Pew Research Center as referring to the generation born between 1981 and 1996\n\nRead more: Streaming is causing a fitness revolution \u2013 and it could redefine gyms as we know them\n\nAmazon claimed the number one spot in Moosylvania\u2019s survey despite ongoing controversies surrounding its business practices and the treatment of its workers.\n\nThe online retail giant, along with other tech giants like Facebook and Google, has been under scrutiny over whether their size and influence in their respective industries is stifling innovation. In July, the Department of Justice said it would launch a broad probe into whether top online platforms are harming competition.\n\nMore recently, the company came under fire after a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that thousands of products sold through Amazon\u2019s digital storefront had been \u201cdeclared unsafe by federal agencies.\u201d\n\nDuring Prime Day in July, hundreds of people called for a boycott of Amazon on social media to show solidarity with factory workers planning to strike in pursuit of improved working conditions.\n\nAmazon also fell out of the Reputation Institute\u2019s annual compilation of the 10 most reputable retailers, the organization announced last month. That\u2019s a noticeable dip from last year when it landed in second place.\n\nAmazon did, however, place in second in this year\u2019s Axios Harris Poll 100, which ranks the reputations of high-profile US companies. In that ranking, Amazon outpaced companies such as Patagonia, Walt Disney, and L.L. Bean.\n\nStill, based on the Pew Research Center\u2019s insights, it\u2019s not surprising to learn that two of the world\u2019s largest technology were among millennials\u2019 most beloved brands.\n\n\u201cTechnology, in particular the rapid evolution of how people communicate and interact, is another generation-shaping consideration,\u201d Michael Dimock, president of the Pew Research Center, wrote in a report outlining the definition of the millennial generation and its successor, generation Z. \u201cBaby boomers grew up as television expanded dramatically, changing their lifestyles and connection to the world in fundamental ways. Generation X grew up as the computer resolution was taking hold, and Millennials came of age during the internet explosion.\u201d\n\nMore millennials also purchase fast-moving consumer goods online than other generations according to Nielsen, which could contribute to the reasons why Amazon resonates so strongly with this generation. Sixty-one percent of millennials said they purchase such products online, compared to 55% for generation X, 445 for baby boomers, and 39% for the greatest generation.", "description": "Business Insider - Amazon ranked as the number one favorite brand among millennials, beating out Apple for the first time..
