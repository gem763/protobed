For this I will propose a written procedure.'\n\nAfter the results were declared, Mr Johnson hailed the historic breakthrough, saying he was 'joyful' that MPs had finally agreed on a Brexit blueprint.\n\nVictory in the 'second reading' means the package has cleared the initial hurdle towards becoming law.\n\nIt is the first time any agreement has been backed in a vote by MPs, and the margin was significantly larger than had been expected.\n\nBut Mr Johnson then suffered a huge setback as MPs effectively blocked from keeping his 'do or die' vow to cut ties by October 31 - with the Commons torpedoing his 72-hour timetable for passing crucial legislation by 322 to 308.\n\nDonald Tusk's tweet suggests that he will recommend accepting the proposed delay set out by the UK in a letter submitted to the bloc at the weekend which asked for Brexit to be pushed back to January 31, 2020 (pictured: in Strasbourg on Tuesday)\n\nDowning Street said Mr Johnson continues to believe the UK should leave the EU on October 31 and that an extension beyond this month would be 'corrosive'.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'Where we are now as a result of the actions of Parliament is that the EU will have to consider the request from Parliament that was conveyed to it at the weekend.'\n\nNo10 could not say how long it would take for the EU to respond.\n\nMr Varadkar said: 'It's welcome that the House of Commons voted by a clear majority in favour of legislation needed to enact Withdrawal Agreement.\n\n'We will now await further developments from London and Brussels about next steps including timetable for the legislation and the need for an extension.'\n\nBoris Johnson renewed his call to 'get Brexit done' despite losing his bid to fast-track laws\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva tweeted: '@EU_Commission takes note of tonight's result and expects the UK government to inform us about the next steps. @eucopresident is consulting leaders on the UK's request for an extension until 31 January 2020.'\n\nHowever, the signs earlier were that the EU is not inclined to weigh in on the PM's behalf.\n\nEuropean council president Donald Tusk today made clear the bloc will always act to avoid the UK crashing out, telling the European Parliament: 'A No Deal Brexit will never be our decision.'", "description": "The Irish PM welcomed news that a 'clear majority' of MPs had backed Boris Johnson's deal in a crucial vote, but said he would now 'await further developments' on the 'need for an extension'", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/20/20052454-0-image-a-70_1571773838601.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
