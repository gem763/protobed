Sign up here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump sought to prod China into doing a trade deal before the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, or face even more difficult negotiations during his potential second term.\n\n\u201cThink what happens to China when I win,\u201d Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday. \u201cDeal would get MUCH TOUGHER!\u201d\n\nTrump said in his tweets that the U.S. is \u201cdoing very well in our negotiations with China,\u201d without offering any specifics. He said he\u2019s certain China would \u201clove to be dealing with a new administration.\u201d\n\nThe tweet comes as Chinese and U.S. officials are struggling to agree on the schedule for a planned meeting this month after Washington rejected Beijing\u2019s request to delay tariffs that took effect over the weekend, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nChina firmly opposes trade war, which is not conducive to China, the U.S., nor the world, China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He told a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Senators Steve Daines and David Perdue on Tuesday, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. Liu said he hoped the two sides could deepen mutual understanding, seek common ground while reserving differences, and properly resolve problems on the basis of equality and mutual respect, according to Xinhua.\n\nDespite efforts by Trump to soothe financial markets and portray the talks as making progress, the world\u2019s two biggest economic powers have yet to agree on basic terms of re-engagement, with mistrust on both sides.\n\nIn a separate posting on Twitter Tuesday, he targeted domestic critics who favor going after China on trade with allies instead of alone -- and sent the European Union another warning about its trading relations with America.\n\n\u201cFor all of the \u2018geniuses\u2019 out there, many who have been in other administrations and \u2018taken to the cleaners\u2019 by China, that want me to get together with the EU and others to go after China Trade practices remember, the EU & all treat us VERY unfairly on Trade also. Will change!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nNew economic data Tuesday provided more evidence of a weakening U.S. economy and sent stocks lower.\n\nNot long after Trump sent his flurry of trade tweets, a report showed U.S. factory activity unexpectedly contracted in August for the first time in three years as shrinking orders, production and hiring pushed a widely followed measure of manufacturing to its lowest level since January 2016. The S&P 500 Index fell on concern U.S.-China trade talks had hit a stumbling block.\n\nTrump has previously sought to cast his negotiations against the 2020 campaign, portraying Democrats as weak negotiators.\n\nTrump said on Twitter in June that Democrat Joe Biden would be \u201cChina\u2019s Dream Candidate, because there would be no more Tariffs.\u201d Biden said in July that Trump\u2019s tariffs are \u201ccrushing American farmers\u201d and said the U.S. needs to be \u201ctough AND smart\u201d in dealing with China.\n\nThe new 15% U.S. duty on about $112 billion of Chinese products will hit Americans more directly than an existing 25% tax on about $250 billion of goods, targeting consumer staples ranging from footwear and apparel to home textiles, as well as technology products like the Apple (NASDAQ: ) Watch. A separate batch of about $160 billion in Chinese goods -- including laptops and mobile phones -- will be hit with 15% tariffs on Dec. 15.\n\n(Update with Liu He comments in fifth paragraph.)", "description": "Trump Sees Trade Deal Tougher on China If He\u2019s Re-Elected", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picecc92eba0d368114bb64cdaacbf3ffe1.jpg"}
