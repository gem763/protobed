Some also type with a single index finger.\n\nAs the smartphone has claimed a bigger and bigger portion of our communications, many educators and researchers have posed questions about the longer-term effects the move to typing on a digital keyboard may have \u2014 particularly on younger generations.\n\nThe better-than-expected results surprised researchers, because typing on a smartphone \u201cis a type of motor skill that people learn on their own with no formal training, which is very unlike typing on physical keyboards,\" study co-author Antti Oulasvirta said in a news release.\n\nAD\n\nTyping this article could have injured me. Here\u2019s why.\n\nIn fact, 10- to 19-year-olds type about 10 wpm faster than people in their 40s do, regardless of whether the keyboard was on a smartphone or a computer. The best typists could do more than 80 wpm.\n\nAD\n\nThe study\u2019s authors predict that the typing gap may close at some point as the population becomes less skilled with physical keyboards and as mobile typing technology improves.\n\nStill, there are some trade-offs when it comes to typing on a smartphone. Those participating in the study left more errors uncorrected, something that also resulted in less backspacing.\n\n\u201cA possible explanation is the higher interaction cost of correcting mistakes on mobile devices and the limited text editing methods,\u201d according to the researchers.\n\nAD\n\nThe researchers collected the typing data from thousands of individuals using an online typing test. The test asked participants to transcribe a series of sentences, and recorded their keystrokes, errors, speed and other metrics. It also asked them to self-report their demographic data, as well as information about how they type and the sort of keyboard they used to complete the test.\n\nAD\n\nSmartphones may have some of the ergonomic risks associated with their more traditional counterparts, professors say.\n\nThe surprisingly positive power of texting, according to science\n\nIra Janowitz, an ergonomics consultant previously associated with the University of California at Berkeley, said that with a touch screen it\u2019s easy for a user to push harder on the keyboard than is necessary, which could cause physical problems over time.\n\nSmartphone usage can lead to neck, shoulder and grip issues, said Bradley Chase, an associate professor of industrial and systems engineering at the University of San Diego.\n\n\u201cThe concerns aren\u2019t fewer, just different\u201d than those with traditional keyboards, Chase said.\n\nAD", "description": "A study found that the fastest way to type on mobile is with two thumbs and auto-correct, and that 10- to 19-year-olds type faster than people in their 40\u2032s.", "authors": ["Marie C.
