Here's what my family spends in a typical week in San Diego, California.", "language": "en", "text": "Our largest expense is our mortgage, which includes the principal, interest, taxes, and insurance.\n\nOur second largest expense is food. A lot of this is discretionary eating out, so we feel we could always pull these expenses back if needed. However, we enjoy eating out, and I like not having to do the dishes. We do try to target good deals, especially Kids Eat Free specials.\n\nThe miscellaneous category is also highly discretionary. For example, I love tech gadgets and have been known to buy a \"toy\" occasionally. This past month I purchased some wireless Bose noise-canceling headphones. My wife, however, is more frugal than I am and rarely purchases high-end items because that's not what makes her happy, per se. She'd much rather spend money on an experience versus a product.\n\nHealthcare and medical costs are $813 a month for our family of four. This is much more expensive compared to a few years ago. There was even a time when we had full coverage with little to no out-of-pocket expense. Nevertheless, our costs are comparatively cheap for the coverage we get. We are all relatively healthy so we have chosen the lower-mid HMO plan that my wife's school district offers.\n\nMy wife has low commuting costs because she works less than a mile away. This was a strategic decision when moving into the area (South San Diego County). Housing prices in this area are also considerably less than comparable homes in the mid and north county of San Diego. This advantage is offset a little because I tend to drive more (sometimes in search of good food!). We both own our cars outright, so there are no monthly payments to deal with.\n\nAlthough we are still saving money every year, our overall savings rate has plummeted in comparison to when I was working full-time. We used to save 50% to 65% of our income during the asset-building years versus the 10% to 15% we save currently. We are OK with a lower savings rate now because we feel that we have built a comfortable baseline of assets.", "description": "Michael Quan lives in San Diego, California, with his wife, who is a school teacher, and two children.
