Analysts at Liberum flagged that the sale of Kier\u2019s residential unit will take time.\n\nThe restructuring plan under CEO Andrew Davies, who took charge in April, came after Kier warned on profit, blaming higher costs and pressures on some businesses. The company also failed last December to convince shareholders to back a rights issue.\n\nKier has said the growing pessimism among bankers, who were cutting their exposure to the industry after the collapse of rival Carillion, hit its share issue plan.\n\nDavies, who worked with BAE Systems (BAES.L) for 28 years in many senior roles, had been due to take over as CEO of Carillion before it collapsed.\n\nTroubled outsourcing company Interserve, one of the British government\u2019s biggest contractors, also slipped into administration in March.\n\nFIRM FOUNDATIONS\n\nNet debt at the end of June was 167 million pounds, lower than 186 million pounds a year earlier.\n\nOperating profit before exceptional items fell 34% to 124 million pounds, while its order book stood at 9.4 billion pounds at the end of June, compared to 9.8 billion pounds a year ago, reflecting the sale of its Australian highways business.\n\n\u201cKier experienced a difficult year, resulting in a disappointing financial performance. However, we are building firm foundations for the future,\u201d Davies said.\n\nKier, whose second biggest shareholder is under-fire British asset manager Neil Woodford, said it did not expect revenue in its buildings business to grow in the current financial year, as Brexit jitters could lead to delays in decision-making by clients.\n\nKier also said separately that its chairman, Philip Cox, would retire once a successor has been appointed.", "description": "Shares in Kier Group slumped as much as 14% after the British contractor posted an annual loss, as a radical overhaul to cut debt and simplify its structure to dodge the problems that have toppled others in the industry pushed costs higher.", "authors": ["Noor Zainab Hussain", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
