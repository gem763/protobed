Also Thursday, Trump sued to block New York prosecutors from their push obtain the returns as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nTrump has bucked decades of precedent by refusing to release them, arguing they are under audit.\n\nEngland, an appointee of former Republican President George W. Bush, plans to issue a written ruling by Oct. 1, and California is expected to appeal.\n\nThe law signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in July says candidates for president must release five years of tax returns by November to run in the California primary, which is scheduled for March 2020.\n\nAttorneys for Trump and the Republican Party argued the law violates the U.S. Constitution by adding an additional requirement to run for president. England also seemed open to their argument that a federal law requiring presidents to disclose financial information supersedes state law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how you skin the cat, it\u2019s an unconstitutional law,\u201d said Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer for the state and national Republican parties.\n\nDemocratic state lawmakers have argued that tax returns provide critical information for voters because they show a candidate\u2019s financial dealings, business interests and charitable giving.\n\nThe law is a part of a feud between California and the Trump administration. They have clashed over issues like immigration and environmental regulations, including the state\u2019s auto mileage standards that Trump said he\u2019s revoking because they are stricter than those issued by federal regulators.\n\nFormer Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, vetoed similar tax return legislation in 2017, arguing it would create a slippery slope of putting extra requirements on presidential candidates.\n\nAll the major Democratic presidential contenders have released their tax returns.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s law also applies to candidates for governor.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge has sided with the Trump campaign's request to halt a California law that's aimed at forcing the president to release his tax returns.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kathleen Ronayne"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/25/France_G7_Summit_Trump_04281.jpg-dcc81_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
