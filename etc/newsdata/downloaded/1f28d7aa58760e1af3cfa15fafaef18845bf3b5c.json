The men involved in this study were younger on average, and therefore already have a very low risk of prostate cancer.\n\n\"This study would need to look at a much broader age range to fully understand whether men who undergo fertility treatment actually have a higher risk overall.\n\n\"If this can be proven, more research would then need to be done to determine the underlying cause. Until then, there is little evidence that there would be any benefit in monitoring these men more closely.\"\n\nHe added: \"We believe it's important that all men are aware of the risks of prostate cancer, and men concerned about the disease should speak to their GP. However, couples considering fertility treatment should not be put off by these results.\"", "description": "Men who have fertility treatment have a higher risk of prostate cancer in later life, a study suggests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B72C/production/_108929864_dadbaby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
