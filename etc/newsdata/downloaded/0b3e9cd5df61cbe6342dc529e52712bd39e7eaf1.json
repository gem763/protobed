The knowledge economy feeds on brain power, and parents will do anything to make sure their kids can compete and achieve in it.\n\nWe have to feed our children to this thing we created, this gaping maw of achievement with long hours and stressful quality of life where we yearn to \u201cwork to live\u201d while committing to \u201clive to work.\u201d We tell kids to follow their bliss, to live their dreams, so long as it puts them at the center of a knowledge-based economy where success is its own reward.\n\nSAT tutors have given way to professional preschool preppers. Two-parent households have double the income to pay for the support needed to enrich their small flock and to keep kids in the orbit of the economy they must be shuffled into. Parents who grew up with all the educational accouterments and those who did not are desperate to make sure their kids get every advantage. If the cities can\u2019t provide that and the parents have the means, they will leave. The students left behind will suffer.\n\nNeither the problems nor the potential solutions are unique to New York. Household sizes and birth rates are in decline throughout the developed world. Fertility is decreasing, and domestic migration is reversing, which means fewer people are moving internally to America\u2019s largest cities.", "description": "", "authors": ["Thefederalist.Com Why-Cities-Are-Becoming-Theme-Parks-Of-Childless-Affluence"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
