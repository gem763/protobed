Jenkins said the left side of his body was affected by the stroke and he is nonverbal.\n\n\u201cHe just started walking last year with assistance,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added, \u201cInstead of being in sports like most little boys, he has spent three to five days a week in therapies and doctor appointments since he was two days old.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut no matter what, his life has been very hard, but he has been so determined to do what other kids do.\u201d\n\nJenkins said even though her son in nonverbal, she can tell he loves football.\n\n\u201cSince he was a baby he would always sit and watch football with my husband and as he got older someone gave him a football as a present and he carries it around the house with him,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen he sees that football he gets very excited.\u201d\n\nOn October 5, Bryson, of Volo, Ill., which is about an hour from Chicago, wore a custom-made jersey and joined the young football team as their honorary captain. He got to go through the banner with the team as they entered the field. The team then started chanting his name. He also got to do the coin toss and was able to watch the game with his family from the sidelines.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to the field, the team of boys came over and said 'Hi' to Bryson, gave him high-fives, and they were so warm and welcoming to Bryson even though they had not met him before,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nShe added, \u201cI think the most amazing part of this is, the coaches told us after the game that the boys weren\u2019t told to do any of that. They decided on their own to start chanting Bryson\u2019s name and just be so involved with him.\u201d\n\nJenkins said the team gave Bryson a football to hold for part of the game. She said with 46 seconds remaining on the clock the team called his number, 85, to the field and, with the help of his father Michael, Bryson scored a touchdown. The crowd went wild.\n\n\u201cIt brought me to tears more than one time that day,\u201d Jenkins told Fox News. \u201cFirst of all, I never imagined he would ever be on a football field, but also because it\u2019s not very often that people are so accepting of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people tend to be very shy around him because they don\u2019t know how to act around someone with special needs.\u201d\n\nNICU GRADUATES REUNITE IN SPECIAL SUPERHERO CELEBRATION\n\nJenkins said her son was invited to be honorary captain after one of the coaches, Danny Gallina, who went to high school with her and her husband, had heard Bryson had cerebral palsy.\n\n\u201cDuring our warmup in pregame, all the boys took it upon themselves to chant Bryson\u2019s name on their own and then it carried over to the touchdown and the boys chanted his name again and then the entire crowd, the other team, everyone started cheering his name and that was pretty heartwarming and neat to be part of,\u201d Gallina told Fox News.\n\n\u201cI am happy for Bryson and I\u2019m happy for the Jenkins family,\u201d he added.\n\nJenkins said, \u201cBryson is nonverbal and we have to tell by his actions [how he feels] and he had a huge smile. He made these excited little screams and he just kept reaching his hands out. He kept touching the boys on the arm and the shoulder, it looked like he was thanking them for, just being so nice. You could tell he felt accepted, he felt included.\u201d\n\nThe Grant Jr. Bulldogs youth football didn\u2019t end up winning the game on October 5, but Jenkins said it was still a memorable day for all those involved.\n\n\u201cEveryone was standing and cheering. I\u2019m pretty sure there wasn\u2019t a dry eye there,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was crying and both teams came together and circled around Bryson and started jumping up and down, chanting his name.\u201d\n\nJenkins told Fox News The National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) contacted her last week and told her the organization will be putting together a presentation for Bryson, which will take place on Tuesday and will include at least ten former NFL players who will be presenting him with a plaque and autographed football.\n\nShe said Tom Serpento, the executive director of the Chicago chapter of NFLPA, told her he was very touched by the story and Bryson is now considered part of the NFL. Jenkins added that Serpento also wants to recognize the boys for being \u201cso outstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe absolutely plan to recognize Bryson and make him an honorary member of the NFL Players Association-Chicago Chapter,\u201d Serpento told Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAnd, equally important, we plan to celebrate and honor the players of The Grant Jr. Bulldogs football team because of their selfless act of kindness to show Bryson acceptance and inclusion. It was that incredibly selfless act that caught our attention and won our hearts.\u201d", "description": "A football team in Illinois made a 7-year-old boy with special needs an honorary captain for a day and even gave him the chance to score a touchdown, the boy\u2019s mother told Fox News on Sunday.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
