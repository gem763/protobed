The Straits Times\n\nMore than a year after introducing the Sales and Services Tax (SST), Malaysia\u2019s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad now says his government will study the possibility of bringing back the Goods and Services Tax (GST), if it is found to be better.\n\nIn a report on Thursday (Oct 3), Mahathir was quoted by The Star as saying: \u201cIf people believe it is better, we will study it.\u201d\n\nHowever, even if the GST were to make a comeback, it would unlikely be during the 2020 Budget announcement, he said. As the Budget would be tabled on October 11, Mahathir reportedly said: \u201cMaybe we can do it later.\u201d\n\nMahathir\u2019s comments on the GST come after state news agency Bernama reported that the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER) was urging the Government to re-introduce the tax in the 2020 Budget at a lower rate of three per cent.\n\nAccording to Bernama, MIER chairman Tan Sri Kamal Salih said the GST system was a \u201cfair system\u201d.\n\n\u201cGST is a fair system, some people said it is regressive because the poor will be affected. But we have exclusion clauses that will protect the lower income group, or B40,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nHe added that he was against the initial implementation of the SST as \u201cno matter how you expand the SST to different sectors or how the enforcement is done, it will still not be enough to fill what (income) has been produced by GST\u201d.\n\nThe SST officially replaced the old GST scheme on September 1, 2018, after Mahathir took power earlier in the year.\n\nUnder the SST scheme, Malaysia charges a tax of 5 per cent and 10 per cent on the sale of goods, and a 6 per cent levy on services.\n\nCompared to the previous GST scheme, Mahathir\u2019s SST had 10 times more exempted goods, including fresh food such as meat, eggs, vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe number of tax-applicable businesses also declined at the time, from 65.85 per cent under the GST system to 43.49 per cent under the SST.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - But even if the GST were to make a comeback, it would unlikely be during the 2020 Budget announcement.
