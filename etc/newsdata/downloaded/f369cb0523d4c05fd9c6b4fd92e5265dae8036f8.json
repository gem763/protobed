Both players were ruled out Friday, but that didn't stop the NFC South leaders from taking down the Monsters of the Midway.\n\nThe Bears (3-3) lost their second straight, with Mitchell Trubisky struggling after missing a game because of a shoulder injury.\n\nThey were hoping their prized quarterback would build on a solid showing in Week 3 against Washington, when he threw for three touchdowns. Instead, he was erratic, made poor decisions and heard it from the crowd.\n\nNew Orleans Saints quarterback Teddy Bridgewater (5) is chased by Chicago Bears nose tackle Eddie Goldman (91) during the first half of an NFL football game in Chicago, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nTrubisky finished 34 of 54 with 251 yards and two late touchdowns in his first appearance since he was hurt early against Minnesota on Sept. 29.\n\nAbout all the fans had to cheer for was a 102-yard kickoff return by Cordarrelle Patterson in the first quarter that matched the second-longest in franchise history.\n\nBut after losing at Oakland in London two weeks ago, it was another rough outing for the Bears. They were outgained 424 yards to 252 in their fifth straight loss to the Saints, and fell to 1-2 at Soldier Field this season.\n\nWith a 12-10 halftime lead, the Saints drove 75 yards for a touchdown on the opening drive of the third quarter. A wide open Ted Ginn Jr. hauled in a 45-yard pass and Latavius Murray ran it in from the 3 on the next play.\n\nNew Orleans then wasted a big opportunity after Chicago's David Montgomery lost a fumble on the next drive. The Saints took over at the Bears 29, only to have Wil Lutz come up short on a 52-yard field goal - his second miss of the day after he made 13 of 14 in the first six games.\n\nBut Taysom Hill caught a 4-yard touchdown with just under three minutes remaining in the third to make it 26-10. And the Saints stayed in control the rest of the way.\n\nINJURIES\n\nSaints: Saints CB Patrick Robinson hurt a hamstring in the first half.\n\nBears: S Sherrick McManis (concussion protocol) left early in the third quarter. He was hurt blocking on a kickoff return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSaints: Host Arizona next Sunday.\n\nBears: Host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nChicago Bears wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson (84) heads to the end zone for a touchdown on a kickoff return ahead of New Orleans Saints' Saquan Hampton (33) and Dwayne Washington (27) during the first half of an NFL football game in Chicago, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019.
