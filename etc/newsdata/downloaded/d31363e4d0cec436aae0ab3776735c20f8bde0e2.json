This is known. But every time Microsoft has tried to strip it down to something simple, users have (rightly?) revolted. Now, the company is officially trying again with the just-announced Windows 10X, and it looks like it may have learned from its mistakes.\n\nThe most important thing you need to know about Windows 10X is that it may actually run traditional Windows \u201clegacy\u201d desktop software, not just apps from the Windows Store or the apps you could run on the web. Right out of the gate, Microsoft\u2019s seemingly dodging the huge limitation that made Windows RT and Windows 10 S such a confusing mess because it\u2019ll seemingly be compatible with the apps you\u2019ve been using for decades.\n\nDesktop apps at last\n\nThe company has a new container technology that will let it run those legacy apps, it told The Verge this week.\n\nBut this stripped-down version of Windows is designed for a distinct new wave of devices where its capabilities may be necessary \u2014 devices like the just-announced dual-screen Surface Neo and upcoming devices from Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo as well.\n\nWith Windows 10X, the company\u2019s making it clear that you\u2019re buying into a distinct experience \u2014 one where a Courier-like device can seamlessly let you move a physical keyboard around on top of its glass screens, and reflow apps around it to let you keep on working.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft tells us it\u2019s exclusively for dual-screen and foldable PCs \u2014 and existing Windows 10 computers won\u2019t be upgradable to Windows 10X. But surprisingly, Microsoft\u2019s dual-screen devices won\u2019t be exclusive to the new OS in kind: Microsoft\u2019s surprise Surface Duo phone runs Android instead.\n\nWindows 10X has a brand-new Start Menu, as was previously leaked, that gives you a list of apps, documents, and files for easy access. In other words, it\u2019s far more like how smartphones and tablets work today.\n\nThe company\u2019s not going in depth to explain how Windows 10X will work beyond the Surface Neo right now, but we may have a few more hints. Back in May, the company envisioned a new wave of devices powered by a future operating system (emphasis is Microsoft\u2019s):\n\nThese new modern PCs and innovative devices the ecosystem will continue to build and bring to market in the future require a modern operating system. An OS that provides a set of enablers that deliver the foundational experiences customers expect from their devices, and includes a set of delighters that deliver innovative human centric experiences. Enablers include seamless updates \u2013 with a modern OS updates are invisibly done in the background; the update experience is deterministic, reliable, and instant with no interruptions! A modern OS, is also secure by default, the state is separated from the operating system; compute is separated from applications; this protects the user from malicious attacks throughout the device lifecycle. Always connected -with a modern OS Wifi, LTE 5G will just work \u2013 and users never have to worry about a deadspot. All of a users devices are aware and connected to each other. A modern OS provides sustained performance, from the moment a user picks up their device \u2013 everything is ready to go \u2013 without having to worry about the next time the PC needs to be charged. These enablers will satisfy customer\u2019s basic needs, but to truly differentiate we must also delight them. A modern OS does this by enabling cloud-connected experiences that use the compute power of the cloud to enhance users experiences on their devices. These experiences are powered by AI, so a modern OS is aware of what a user is doing tomorrow and helps them get it done, and it enhances applications making them more intelligent. A modern OS is also multi-sense. People can use pen, voice, touch, even gaze \u2013 what ever input method a user wants to use works just as well as the keyboard and mouse. Finally, a modern OS provides the ultimate in form factor agility. A modern OS has the right sensor support and posture awareness to enable the breadth of innovative form factors and applications that our partner ecosystem will deliver\n\nFewer annoying update prompts sounds particularly nice.\n\nMicrosoft says Windows 10X is coming holiday 2020. The first wave of devices will all arrive next fall and be powered by Intel chips, according to the company\u2019s blog post.\n\nUpdate, 1:23PM ET: Added confirmation that Windows 10X is exclusive to dual-screen and foldable devices.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s long-rumored Windows Lite has been officially revealed as Windows 10X, a stripped-down version of the Windows 10 operating system designed for a new wave of ultra mobile computing \u2014 specifically, dual-screen tablets.", "authors": ["Sean Hollister", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXvNr44uNjO2ZNSCbOinYlg5aLE=/0x145:2000x1192/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19252998/lcimg_f33466c6_db62_4b76_b40c_49065a2b4cc7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
