Josh Hawley is anti-Semitic for calling WaPo\u2019s Greg Sargent \u2018a smug, rich liberal elitist\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley recently called the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent a \u201csmug, rich liberal elitist\u201d:\n\nOnly a smug, rich liberal elitist would say that defending your home is \u201cphony pastoral posturing,\u201d whatever that means. No, Greg, I don\u2019t think living in Missouri is \u201cpunishment.\u201d But this is the new left: utter, open contempt for the people of the heartland and all we love https://t.co/0F8e3OZttq \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 21, 2019\n\nSargent wrote a whole post about it, in fact. And Jake Tapper shared it, helpfully pointing out that Hawley\u2019s insult was directed at a Jewish journalist:\n\nIn which \u2066@HawleyMO\u2069 calls a Jewish journalist a \u201csmug, rich liberal elitist\u201d https://t.co/44Mh94mcnO \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 22, 2019\n\nOK \u2026 and?\n\nGreg Sargent is Jewish? I confess I have followed @ThePlumLineGS on Twitter for seven years or so and never knew that. https://t.co/n4wMKb9sK5 \u2014 Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) October 22, 2019\n\nUntil we read Sargent\u2019s column, we didn\u2019t know that, either. Is there any proof that Hawley did? And that his comment about Sargent stemmed from anti-Semitism?\n\nFor defending my homestate of Missouri, liberal media have called me \u201cphony,\u201d \u201cugly,\u201d \u201csmarmy,\u201d a racist and now an anti-Semite. All in 24 hrs. This is how they bully those who aren\u2019t part of the DC club. But I don\u2019t care what slurs they use, I will ALWAYS defend Missouri https://t.co/pfUGKEbcv5 \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 22, 2019\n\nCome on, Jake.\n\nPretty sure any journalist of any religion or with a complete lack of religion could be labeled as such. And most of middle and non-urban America would have similar commentary about many MSM journalists after the last 3 years of being disparaged & insulted by the same. \u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) October 22, 2019\n\nNo kidding. Casually throwing out the anti-Semitism card is unnecessary and also transparently hacky.\n\nYou're right: no non-Jewish person has ever been called a smug, rich liberal elitist. Even for someone such as yourself, this is pretty hackish. \u2014 Physics Geek (@physicsgeek) October 22, 2019\n\nThis is a low blow from @jaketapper. He should know better. https://t.co/3B4DFofNek \u2014 Pradheep J. Shanker (@Neoavatara) October 22, 2019\n\nGood Lord, Jake. This is beneath you\u2026or at least I thought it was. Maybe that's my bad? \u2014 John Hyde (@JohnFlippinHyde) October 22, 2019\n\nOf the words smug, rich, liberal, or elitist, which one(s) say \"Jewish\" to you, Jake? https://t.co/lEO5uQ2uvG \u2014 Eric Spencer (@JustEric) October 22, 2019\n\nWas it cuz they are Jewish or because they are a smuch rich liberal elitist? If not the former, why even mention that they are Jewish? \u2014 Dad Ayup (@Dadbyup) October 22, 2019\n\nI like Tapper, but man he just pulled that Jewish thing right outta his ass. I don't see it, and I'm no fan of Hawley. \u2014 ConservativeBlackMan \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@NevilleD35) October 22, 2019\n\nWhat does his being Jewish have to do with this? \u2014 Dale Kingston (@DaleKingston06) October 22, 2019\n\nWtf Jake? What does him being Jewish have to do with that insult? With so much blatant and actual antisemitism going on across the political spectrum, it\u2019s not helpful to invent dog whistles. Especially when so many people are ignoring bullhorns. \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) October 22, 2019\n\nMaybe we can have Richard Spencer on again with his expert opinion to analyze this. \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) October 22, 2019\n\nGood idea.", "description": "jake tapper", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Am On October", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jake-tapper-wtf-face_new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
