In New York, state test results last week showed that charter schools in every region outperformed traditional public schools in English and math proficiency \u2014 by double digits.\n\nYet leading Democrats, in the Empire State and nationally, are increasingly hostile to charters. This, even though polling suggests the schools are broadly popular with the disadvantaged minorities they claim to speak for.\n\nNew polling, also out last week, shows that nationally, 58% of Hispanic Democratic voters and 53% of black Democrats support charters, while only 30% of white Democrats do. The same poll found that overall support for charter schools has climbed to 48%, from a low of 39% in 2017.\n\nYet 2020 Dem presidential hopefuls sound like they\u2019d sooner yank out their own eyes with rusty spoons than back charter growth. Even one-time charter hero Cory Booker has jelly legs. Mayor Bill de Blasio vents \u201chatred\u201d for the charter world, even though in his city, the charter school student body is 91% black or Hispanic and 80% low-income.\n\nThe candidates\u2019 desire to win over the notoriously anti-charter and overwhelmingly white teachers\u2019 unions is a driver. And there\u2019s the political imperative to oppose anything supported by the Trump administration.\n\nBut if Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders & Co. took a peek into the classrooms of America\u2019s charter schools, maybe they would reassess. In New York City alone, visiting just three schools would burst their ideological bubble.\n\nThe candidates could start in America\u2019s poorest congressional district, in the South Bronx, home to the highest concentration of New York City\u2019s 235 charters. They might visit Bronx Global Learning Institute for Girls, a K-8 school focused on technology, music and social-emotional learning for young women and girls. With a student body that often comes to school exhausted from having to parent younger siblings (Mom was working a double shift), BGLIG outperformed its local district on the state test.\n\nAfterward, the candidates could cross the Macombs Dam Bridge and head south 10 blocks to visit New York\u2019s first charter school, the result of an odd-bedfellows partnership between a one-time Freedom Rider who \u00adbecame Martin Luther King\u2019s chief of staff and a Wall Street \u00adfinancier, and named after Nelson Mandela\u2019s partner in overthrowing apartheid in South Africa.\n\nIn today\u2019s hyper-divided world, the collaboration between the Rev. Wyatt T. Walker and Steve Klinsky might never be allowed to happen. But on Harlem\u2019s 145th Street, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School outscored its local city school district in five of six testing grades this past year.\n\nNext, the candidates could head to Brooklyn, to MESA Charter HS on Palmetto Street. Now in its seventh year, MESA might be the best charter high school in the state.\n\nMESA is exactly the kind of school even charter opponents have difficulty hating. It\u2019s not part of a charter network. Classrooms and hallways are orderly, yet decidedly not of the \u201cno-excuses\u201d model that has caused handwringing among many.\n\nAlmost all the students who enter in the ninth grade graduate on time. Dropouts are rare.\n\nIts most recent seniors were accepted into some of America\u2019s most selective schools, including Wesleyan, Boston College, Boston University, Howard and Brandeis in addition to the top state schools and the best CUNY schools. Others have decided to serve in the military.\n\nMESA is diverse in the way New York politicians like. Graduation emcee Bryan Cuzco-Sinchi introduced himself in June as \u201ca proud gay, Ecuadorian, soon-to-be-first-generation college student.\u201d He has received a full scholarship to Skidmore, which has a lower acceptance rate than New York University.\n\nAlmost all of MESA\u2019s students live in Bushwick, where housing costs are up, but the public high school graduation rate isn\u2019t. That rate languishes at 60%, \u00adunder the statewide rate of 80% and far below MESA\u2019s 95%. For students with disabilities, MESA\u2019s graduation rate is 85%, compared to 47% for the local district and 29% for the state.\n\nMESA has been OK\u2019d to open another high school just like this one, but can\u2019t, because the Legislature won\u2019t lift an arbitrary cap on the number of charters in New York City.\n\nCharters in New York have strong support from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who last year easily won a third term in one of the nation\u2019s most progressive states. Perhaps America\u2019s other Democrats will see they\u2019re not all that bad.\n\nRobert Bellafiore, a public strategy consultant, has been involved with charter schools for more than 20 years.", "description": "Despite their enormous successes, charter schools in New York and across the country are in a precarious spot heading into the new school year.
