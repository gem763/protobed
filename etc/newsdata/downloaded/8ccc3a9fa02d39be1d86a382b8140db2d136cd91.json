Trump imposed a tariff hike on Turkey last year after the country held Andrew Brunson, American pastor, on charges of espionage.\n\nThe executive order also stated that the Commerce Department would be suspending negotiations on an unknown trade deal worth $100 billion. The White House and Commerce Department have declined to comment on the deal.\n\nTrump has come under fire from swaths of lawmakers, including fellow Republicans, for his decision to pull back U.S. troops from the war-torn region.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement on Monday saying he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the U.S. response to Turkey\u2019s attacks on Kurdish allies in Syria.\n\n\u201cAbandoning this fight now and withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria would re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States\u2019 strategic interests.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Lindsey Graham (Republican-South Carolina) joined forces on Monday to announce they want Congress to \u201coverturn\u201d Trump\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cJust spoke with Speaker Pelosi regarding congressional action on Turkey\u2019s incursion of Syria. Speaker supports bipartisan sanctions against Turkey\u2019s outrages in Syria. She also believes we should show support for Kurdish allies and is concerned about the reemergence of ISIS,\u201d Graham wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAs we find ourselves in a situation where the President gave a green light to the Turks to bomb and effectively unleashed ISIS, we must have a stronger sanctions package than what the White House is suggesting,\u201d Pelosi tweeted later.\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. troops has allowed the Turkish military to proceed with a planned invasion into northern Syria, where Kurdish fighters had aided American forces in fighting what was left of the ISIS terror group.\n\nReports coming out of Syria say Turkish-backed fighters may be committing war crimes. Images have been posted on social media showing the violence, including a graphic video that purports to show the execution of a Kurdish man by a Turkish fighter.\n\nTrump said his executive order would impose \u201cpowerful additional sanctions\u201d on Turkish officials or anyone else \u201cwho may be involved in serious human rights abuses, obstructing a ceasefire, preventing displaced persons from returning home, forcibly repatriating refugees, or threatening the peace, security, or stability in Syria.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has publicly embraced an \"America first\" approach to foreign affairs, defended his decision to withdraw from the region, decrying U.S. involvement in foreign wars.\n\n\u201cAfter defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, I largely moved our troops out of Syria. Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nTop Pentagon officials and national security leaders were caught off guard by Trump\u2019s move. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper released a statement on Monday claiming Turkey\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d invasion into Syria undermines the mission to defeat ISIS and puts remaining U.S. forces at risk.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s unilateral action was unnecessary and impulsive. President Erdogan bears full responsibility for its consequences, to include a potential ISIS resurgence, possible war crimes, and a growing humanitarian crisis,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThe bilateral relationships between our two countries has also been damaged.\u201d\n\nDoug Palmer contributed to this report.", "description": "US President says that he will issue executive order.", "authors": ["Evan Semones", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180496122-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
