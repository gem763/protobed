He was suspended for a year.", "language": "en", "text": "The incident comes at a time when the NBA is enmeshed in a controversy over its relationship with China.\n\nDuring a post-match interview on the official Taiwanese Hearthstone stream, Blitzchung, wearing a gas mask, cried, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!\u201d At that point, the stream cut to a commercial break. The comment came during the last weekend of the Hearthstone Grandmasters Asia-Pacific regular season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlizzard on Tuesday announced that Blitzchung\u2019s action violated its rules of competition, citing a prohibition on \u201cEngaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages\u201d Blizzard\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cAs you know there are serious protests in my country now,\u201d Blitzchung said in a statement to Inven Global before the ban was announced. \u201cMy call on [the] stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention. I put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months, that I sometimes couldn\u2019t focus on preparing my Grandmaster match. I know what my action on [the] stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it\u2019s my duty to say something about the issue.\u201d\n\nLike the NBA, Blizzard is heavily invested in China through its Overwatch League and it has sought to balance those business interests with the right to free expression. Tencent, the Chinese gaming giant, owns a five-percent stake in Activision Blizzard, Blizzard\u2019s parent company. (Tencent is also the NBA\u2019s rights holder in China.) And Blizzard has long had a partnership with NetEase, the Chinese Internet company. According to Quartz, Blizzard is believed to derive 12 percent of its revenue from the Asia-Pacific market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to reemphasize tournament and player conduct within the Hearthstone esports community from both players and talent,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhile we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.\u201d\n\nBlitzchung was also stripped of his prize money.\n\nBlizzard terminated its contract with the two casters conducting the interview. The two casters dived under the table as soon as Blitzchung made his statement.\n\nAs with the NBA, Blizzard is seeking to strike a balance between its considerable financial stake in China and the right to free expression. Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey started a firestorm with a now-deleted tweet reading \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The league struggled with its initial response to blowback from Chinese businesses and its domestic basketball league. Initially calling the tweet \u201cregrettable,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has sought to ease the damage in both countries, saying that the league does not censor what its owners, players, or employees say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA proposal by Hong Kong to allow extraditions from the semiautonomous territory to China sparked the protests, which stem from a fear that Beijing\u2019s leaders would seek to systematically pick apart the freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "Blizzard punished Blitzchung, whose hometown is Hong Kong, for comments he said \"could cause me lot of trouble.\"", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g3j11MIz46ZMPhdwDJQvWk_N2fA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IJH6KIXYFEI6RBSCZFYYUJLMXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
