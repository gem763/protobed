We are excited to announce that on March 3 next year TechCrunch will host its fourth annual TC Sessions: Robotics & AI at UC Berkeley\u2019s Zellerbach Hall.\n\nLast year, 1,500 founders, technologists, engineering students and investors turned up for a day of main stage interviews with the top figures in AI and robotics, as well as workshops, speaker Q&A and intense networking. The show aims to sit at the intersection of straight-up technology and robotics startups, a zone that\u2019s getting richer every year thanks to rapid advances in AI, GPUs, sensors and all the other related fields.\n\nBoston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert, a regular guest at the show, sums up the show this way: \u201cTechCrunch\u2019s AI / Robotics show blends the best of thoughtful, research-focused robotics with a unique business in technology focus. The result is an event that not only shows cutting edge technology but provides perspective of how it will be impacting business soon.\u201d\n\nLast year, we officially added AI to the title of the show, a recognition that AI is perhaps the single biggest driver behind rapid advancement in robotics. As serial medical robotics entrepreneur Dr. Frederic Moll said at TechCrunch Disrupt SF earlier this week, \u201cEverybody focuses on the mechatronic part of robotics, but what\u2019s going to change the world is the intelligence of robotics.\u201d\n\nGet ready for TechCrunch editorial interviews with the world\u2019s top robotics and AI experts, newsmaking demos, super edifying workshops and fantastic networking. Whether you\u2019re looking for technology and product insights, investment, engineering talent, new partners or all of the above, no show delivers more in a single day than TC Sessions: Robotics & AI.\n\nIf you want to get a sense of agendas from our past shows, check out past agendas: 2017 @ MIT, 2018 @UC Berkeley, 2019 @ UC Berkeley.\n\nRegister your interest today for the event and you\u2019ll save $100 off tickets when sales launch.\n\nInterested in sponsoring the event?
