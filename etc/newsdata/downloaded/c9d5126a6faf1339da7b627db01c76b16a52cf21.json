REUTERS/Yuya Shino\n\nThe three rank highly because their huge populations mostly walk to work or use public transport, with relatively few commuters traveling by car.\n\n\u201cEvery second person takes public transport to work,\u201d Rolf Kullen, Senior Director for Mobility at Kantar, told Reuters about Beijing commuters.\n\nThe study questioned 20,000 commuters in 31 cities around the world about their journeys to work. Seoul boosted the Asian showing, coming in in seventh place.\n\nFour European cities, London, Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Moscow, are also in the top ten, along with Nairobi and Sao Paulo. No North American city made the higher rankings.\n\nLondon snagged the top spot in Europe thanks to its expansive public rail network, but high levels of car commuting in the suburbs of European \u201cbike capitals\u201d Amsterdam and Copenhagen pushed them down the list.\n\n\u201cThese cities were built for the car,\u201d said Kullen, but praised efforts to shift commuting behavior to other means of transport.\n\nKullen said public transport needs to be extended in cities across the globe to help remove cars from the streets and make commuting greener, especially in the suburbs.\n\nReducing the number of cars is an important factor in reducing air pollution in cities and improving the quality of life and general health of their inhabitants.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on human rights and the environment has said air pollution causes 7 million premature deaths per year, calling it a \u201chuman rights issue\u201d and a \u201cglobal health crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges facing global cities today is moving commuters away from the convenience and comfort of their cars and onto more sustainable transport options,\u201d Guillaume Saint, Global Automotive & Mobility Lead at Kantar said in a statement.\n\nJens Muller, air quality manager at Brussels-based campaign group Transport and Environment, said the three top 10 European cities had one thing in common.\n\n\u201cThey have all decided to move people, not cars.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not even that people want to commute by car. Kantar said many people would prefer to walk or cycle to work but it wasn\u2019t always possible.\n\n\u201cThe most attractive modes are actually walking and biking. People do like to move,\u201d Kullen said. \u201cPeople are happy on two wheels.\u201d", "description": "Three Asian metropolises - Tokyo, Beijing and Singapore - are the world's leading environmentally-friendly commuting cities, a report to be released by data insight company Kantar on Thursday says.", "authors": ["Jonas Ekblom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441516032&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1E0", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
