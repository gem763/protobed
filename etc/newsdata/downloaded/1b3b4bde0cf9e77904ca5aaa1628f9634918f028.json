Fidelity offers dozens of actively-managed funds with above-average performance and below-average expense ratios.\n\nFidelity also offers some of the lowest-cost index funds available in the mutual fund universe. This combination of choices makes Fidelity funds one of the best one-stop shops for mutual funds.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnother distinction of Fidelity Investments is that some of its best funds concentrate on sectors, which may prove to be valuable for portfolio construction in 2019.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for the best mutual funds to own in 2019, you could build an entire portfolio for the year with these Fidelity funds.\n\nFidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX)\n\n7 Best Fidelity Funds for 2019 More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nExpenses: 0.015%, or $1.50 for every $10,000 invested\n\nFormerly Fidelity Spartan 500 Index Investor Shares, the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (MUTF:FXAIX) is a smart and extremely cheap way to get diversified access to large U.S. companies.\n\nFXAIX tracks the S&P 500 index, which includes stocks of over 500 of the largest U.S. companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nWhile 2019 still may see more of the volatility and downside pressure on stocks like investors saw in the fourth quarter of 2018, FXAIX and similar S&P 500 index funds can be smart, core holdings for long-term investors.\n\nFidelity Total Bond Fund (FTBFX)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nExpenses: 0.45%\n\nFor your fixed income core holding in 2019, you\u2019ll need a low-cost, diversified total bond market fund like Fidelity Total Bond Fund (MUTF:FTBFX).\n\nAlthough bond prices could see downside pressure from rising rates in 2019, a slowing economy can cause the Fed to continue to pause its rate-hike campaign.\n\nTwo to three rate hikes are already priced in. If the Fed pauses after one or two rate hikes in 2019, long-term bonds will jump in price faster than short-term bonds.\n\nThis uncertainty makes a diversified fund like FXAIX a wise fund to hold in 2019. The fund\u2019s portfolio covers the entire U.S. bond market.\n\nFidelity Short-Term Bond Fund (FSHBX)\n\nbonds More\n\nSource: United States Treasury, Bureau of Public Debt via Wikimedia\n\nExpenses: 0.45%\n\nTo help defend against interest rate risk in 2019, a smart complement to your core bond holding is Fidelity Short-Term Bond Fund (MUTF:FSHBX).\n\nWhen interest rates are rising, bond funds that hold bonds with short average maturity tend to perform better than those with long average maturity. This is because demand for yesterday\u2019s lower-rate bonds decreases while demand for today\u2019s higher-rate bonds increases.\n\nTherefore, the longer the maturity, the greater the fall in price.\n\nFSHBX can either complement a core bond fund or it can potentially provide greater yields than money market funds.\n\nFidelity Select Health Care Portfolio (FSPHX)", "description": "[Editor's note: This story was previously published in June 2019.
