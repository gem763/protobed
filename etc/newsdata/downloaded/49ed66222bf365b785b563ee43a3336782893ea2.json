Another thing conspicuous for its absence was the lack of any numerical guidance for the coming fiscal year, with chief financial officer Mat Dunn only giving away a Capex target of 150 million pounds ($190 million) on a call with analysts.\n\nIt was a torrid year for a company that had been a stock market darling for much of the last decade: profits fell 68% as the new, highly-automated warehouses in both the U.S. and Europe, which were supposed to help it become a global player, suffered a succession of problems. Sales in the booming U.S. market grew only 9%.\n\nCEO Nick Beighton admitted on an analyst call that the company hadn\u2019t had the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to manage such a large project, but said the worst was now behind it.\n\n\u201cHaving identified the root causes of our operational issues, we have made substantial progress over the last few months in resolving them. Whilst there remains lots of work to be done to get the business back on track, we are now in a more positive position to start the new financial year,\u201d Beighton said.\n\nHe told analysts that the company\u2019s investments mean it has now increased its throughput capacity to 10 million units a weeks \u2013 a fivefold increase from 2016. The focus now switches to squeezing the most out of those investments.\n\nCrucially, the investments have helped Asos diversify its sales away from a U.K. market overshadowed by Brexit. Over 60% of its sales now come from abroad.\n\nEven after its surge on Wednesday morning, Asos shares are still down by nearly half from 12 months ago, and the company trades at less than one year\u2019s sales. By comparison, rival Boohoo trades at nearly three times that multiple \u2013 albeit Boohoo\u2019s management has arguably deserved the premium having done a better job of managing the upscaling process.\n\nElsewhere Wednesday, Europe\u2019s stocks were largely on the retreat, as traders tempered their hopes for a deal to stop the U.K. crashing out of the EU at the end of the month amid reports of dissent from U.K. Conservative Euroskeptic backbench lawmakers, and from the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nThe benchmark was down 0.3% at 392.70 by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), having hit its highest level since late July on Tuesday. The U.K. was down 0.2% while the more U.K.-focused was the worst performer in the region, losing 1.0%. The German was down 0.1% while the Swiss outperformed after a strong earnings report from pharma heavyweight Roche (SIX: ).", "description": "StockBeat: Fallen Angel Asos Is Back in Fashion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB8107Z_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
