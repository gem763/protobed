Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.1%.\n\n\"The minor disappointment in July GDP moved the currency ... but the big mover was the 10 o'clock manufacturing ISM number out of the U.S.,\" said Michael Goshko, corporate risk manager at Western Union Business Solutions.\n\nThe U.S. dollar <.DXY> declined against a basket of major currencies after data showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in September to its weakest level in more than a decade as business conditions worsened amid U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nIn contrast, Canadian manufacturing activity expanded in September at the fastest pace in seven months as new orders and production picked up, according to the IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index.\n\n\"Our manufacturing number for September was a beat ... that would have added to the positive tone in Canada,\" Goshko said.\n\nThe Bank of Canada has worried that the U.S.-China trade conflict is weighing more heavily on the global economy, but has showed no appetite for cutting rates amid steady domestic activity..\n\nThe price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell as weak U.S. economic data dimmed crude's demand outlook. U.S. crude oil futures <CLc1> settled 0.8% lower at %53.62 a barrel.\n\nCanadian government bond prices were higher across a steeper yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year <CA2YT=RR> rose 8.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.533% and the 10-year <CA10YT=RR> was up 6 Canadian cents to yield 1.355%.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by Paul Simao and Tom Brown)", "description": "The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, recovering from an earlier one-week low after evidence the U.S.-China trade war was hurting U.S. manufacturing activity.
