However, a few stocks have bucked the trend and are setting up for a big run if/when conditions improve.\n\nOne of the top stocks from our watchlist is Solaredge Technologies (NASDAQ: ), which has a ton of potential and could soon explode higher with some help from the market.\n\nThe weekly chart of SEDG below shows the recent breakout to new all-time highs on heavy volume. This was followed by a healthy 20% correction off the highs that found support at the rising 10-week moving average.\n\nPer Investors Business Daily\u2019s ratings, SEDG carries a relative strength rating of 99, which is tops and an 85 earnings-per-share rating. The solar industry is currently ranked 2 of 197 groups and SEDG is the clear leader of the group.\n\nWeekly Solaredge Technologies\n\nIn mid-September, SEDG undercut its 50-day moving average and the prior low from the gap-up day, which led to a strong reversal to range highs.\n\nRecent breakout attempts have failed to follow through, but that isn\u2019t really a knock on SEDG as the market just isn\u2019t ready to support big breakouts yet. If/when conditions start to improve, look for SEDG to be one of the first breakouts to new highs.\n\nDaily Solaredge Technologies\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Deron Wagner covering: SolarEdge Technologies Inc.
