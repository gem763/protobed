Additionally, \"those showing up and being there for more than six months had a 30% increase.\"\n\nThe study had some limitations. It found only an association between World Trade Center exposure and long-term cardiovascular risk, but more research is needed to determine whether a causal relationship exists.\n\n\"We can not prove causality in a study of a little less than 10,000 people and we don't have a control group of unexposed. We have a control group of lesser exposed,\" Prezant said. \"To take this study to the next level, we would have to compare it to a cohort of unexposed firefighters and then a cohort of the general population that are not firefighters.\"\n\nThe new study joins several others that have found an association between firefighters responding to the World Trade Center disaster and elevated health risks.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a link between exposure to carcinogens and other toxins in the dust from the World Trade Center wreckage and an increased risk of some cancers among people who worked at the site, including firefighters\n\nRemembering lives lost\n\nOn Thursday, the Fire Department of the City of New York announced that it will add the names of 22 members who died of illnesses related to their work in rescue and recovery efforts at the World Trade Center to the FDNY World Trade Center Memorial Wall. More than 200 members have died of World Trade Center-related illnesses, according to the department.\n\n\"This solemn wall is a poignant and permanent reminder of the sacrifice of all that responded on September 11th and toiled for weeks and months at the World Trade Center searching for the innocent lives taken that day,\" Fire Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro said in a written statement\n\n\"Because of their dedication and bravery, each year the already staggering loss suffered by the FDNY continues to grow as illnesses claimed the lives of those who so bravely served our city.\"\n\nThe fund was set to expire in 2020. The newly signed legislation, championed by comedian Jon Stewart , ensures compensation for victims through 2090.\n\nThe extension of the fund will ensure compensation for people injured during the 2001 terrorist attacks or the rescue and cleanup efforts that took place in the immediate aftermath of the attack under hazardous conditions.\n\nJUST WATCHED Watch Jon Stewart's reaction to 9/11 bill passing Replay More Videos ...

It's a major contributor to the global burden of disease after all, not just in highly exposed firefighters,\" Trasande said.\n\n\"Second, the disaster produced a plume of toxic chemicals, the likes of which are not in your routine air pollution,\" he said. \"Then there's the stress that's well known among people who were exposed to the World Trade Center disaster, especially responders like firefighters who are put in harm's way frequently to save lives. So there are three pathways by which the findings described here unfortunately were plausible.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nExposure to the plume of dust and toxins from the 9/11 attack also can be tied to abnormal cholesterol levels in children who were living or going to school near the World Trade Center at the time, according to a separate study led by Trasande and published in the journal Environment International in 2017. High cholesterol is a risk factor of heart disease.\n\n\"The good news is there are steps that people can take to prevent and reduce cardiovascular risk going forward, even if they've had substantially heightened risk,\" Trasande said.\n\n\"Healthy diet and physical activity are still important counter weapons in the fight against cardiovascular disease,\" he said. The new study \"reinforces the need for healthy diet and physical activity as well as ongoing medical monitoring.\"", "description": "Exposure to the World Trade Center disaster is significantly associated with long-term cardiovascular disease risk in New York firefighters, according to a new study.
