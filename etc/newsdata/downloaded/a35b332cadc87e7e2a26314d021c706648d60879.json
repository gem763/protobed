I am as excited to see what he can do as I would be if \u2018Chessie\u2019 were playing. Sbu has been very close to selection as it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nNkosi has made two appearances in the tournament, against Namibia and a try-scoring show against Canada - on the left wing - to follow up try-scoring appearances against Australia and Argentina (two tries) in the two South African home Tests in 2019.\n\n\n\nHis injury-enforced inclusion is the only change to the 23 that had been entrusted to ensure second place in the pool (against Italy) and to secure a semi-final place (against Japan).\n\n\n\nThe Springbok 23 includes 10 players who appeared in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final victory over Wales four years ago in England (23-19), and nine who are making a second semi-final appearance after losing to eventual champions, New Zealand, four years ago.\n\n\n\nThe nine are Tendai Mtawarira, Frans Malherbe, Eben Etzebeth, Lood de Jager, Francois Louw, Duane Vermeulen, Handr\u00e9 Pollard, Damian de Allende and Willie le Roux. Pieter-Steph du Toit was on the bench in the quarter-final at Twickenham in 2015.\n\n\n\nThe winner will play the victor of the England v New Zealand semi-final in Yokohama on Saturday (10:00 SA time).\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 S'bu Nkosi, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\n\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn\n\nWales\n\nTBA\n\n- SA Rugby", "description": "Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus has named his team for their Rugby World Cup semi-final against Wales in Yokohama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2858/03e8ee6261e1421f95ad038eb17d33bc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
