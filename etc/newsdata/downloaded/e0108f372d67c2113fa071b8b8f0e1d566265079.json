The upper house can only block a bill once.\n\nRights groups had denounced the law as repressive and accused Najib of using it to cover up allegations of corruption and mismanagement.\n\n\"The repeal of the anti-fake news law is welcome news that is long overdue,\" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said in an email to Al Jazeera.\n\nThe lower house voted to abolish the law in August 2018, but the repeal was rejected by the upper house, or senate, which is dominated by Najib's defeated Barisan Nasional coalition.\n\nMalaysia was among the first countries in the world to introduce anti-fake news legislation.\n\nNeighbouring Singapore has passed similar legislation, which came into effect this month despite objections from opposition politicians. Thailand is planning to open a \"fake news\" centre to monitor online content in November.\n\n\"Such anti-fake news laws are just a a rebranding of government censorship in a more appealing form, designed to fool people while enabling officials to shut down criticism they don't like,\" Robertson said.", "description": "Law passed by previous government which critics said was designed to stifle dissent repealed at second attempt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/022285d441af4d72a150fae84dc0df01_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
