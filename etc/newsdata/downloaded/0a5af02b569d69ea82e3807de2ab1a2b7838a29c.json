He won two Palmes d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006 and 2016.\n\nHis winning film in 2016, I, Daniel Blake, depicted people in poverty navigating the British welfare system.\n\nThe filmmaker was in Lyon recently for the Lumi\u00e8re Film Festival where he gave a masterclass on socially-oriented cinema.\n\nHe spoke to Euronews about his films and the current state of politics.\n\n\"Commercial cinema is about something else but there\u2019s a good tradition of cinema which is about reflecting the life we know\u2026 You have to be optimistic, I mean people by and large have good instincts. You know they want to live well, they want to live in dignity they don\u2019t want to live in inequality. People are always encouraging,\" Loach said.\n\nLoach even commented on Brexit, explaining his view that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's agreement with the EU will not be in the interest of ordinary people.\n\n\"We do know that if Boris Johnson makes the agreement it will not be in the interest of ordinary people. It will be in the interest of big business and so it won\u2019t be what the people need, which is security of work, decent wages, good public services,\" Loach said. \"It won\u2019t be that. It\u2019ll be an agreement that supports big business.\"", "description": "Filmmaker Ken Loach was in Lyon for the Lumi\u00e8re Film Festival where he spoke to Euronews about his socially aware and realistic cinema.", "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ponsard"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/88/44/1000x563_cmsv2_280c3bfe-c7a4-5fdf-a592-dfe89b2ba3d1-4258844.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
