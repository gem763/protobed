Wednesday, they seem to be stabilizing, and perhaps the sellers have run out of ammo.\n\nI know that GW Pharma's (GWPH) stock seems to have stabilized. I had CEO Justin Gover on the show last night, and I felt better that the Europeans have approved Epidiolex for pediatric epilepsy.\n\nBut after reading a report from Favus this morning that shows a large spike in the number of patients who have died who take the drug may have more to do with the stock's decline leading up to the interview than I thought.\n\nAccording to data obtained from a Food and Drug Administration database, there's been a \"dramatic acceleration in Epidiolex-related deaths during July and August.\" In July there were 16 Epidiolex U.S. deaths vs. 15 Epidiolex-related deaths between January and June. There were 12 more deaths in August.\n\nFavus' view? \"We are surprised to see a sharp increase in Epidiolex related deaths in US patients, which was not apparent in the clinical trial data. GW did not mention this data at the Morgan Stanley Conference last week, though they were asked about the safety profile.\"\n\nAnd the potential coup de grace and the real reason for the stock's weakness? \"The death rate most likely means Epidiolex will be removed from the US market as an FDA approved drug.\"\n\nNow this firm has a sell on the stock. Justin Gover gave \"Mad Money\" no indication that there is anything but satisfaction in the medical and patient community for the drug. If the FDA were to take this action, it would shock the market.\n\nBut I thought to not pass this on to you would be a mistake, because it is the source of much of the angst about the stock.\n\nIt's been a hugely successful drug. It has helped thousands.\n\nBut this death rate does sound suboptimal and needs to be factored in to any owner's calculations.", "description": "A report shows a large spike in the number of patients who have died who take GW's pediatric epilepsy drug -- and that could shock the cannabis industry if the FDA takes action....GWPH", "authors": ["Jim Cramer", "Here'S What Gw Pharma'S Ceo Didn'T Tell Me", "It'S Big", "A Report Shows A Large Spike In The Number Of Patients Who Have Died Who Take Gw'S Pediatric Epilepsy Drug --", "That Could Shock The Cannabis Industry If The Fda Takes Action.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Peter Tchir", "Gary Berman", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/acb45d70-40f4-11e9-ab5a-8542bad65f20.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
