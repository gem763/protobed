Headwinds picked up overnight, which slowed us down to start with, but that was part of our scenario planning.\n\n\"Given how long we were airborne, we were able to keep optimising the flight path to make the best of the conditions.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Qantas)\n\n\"We had a lot of interest from air traffic controllers as we crossed through different airspace because of the uniqueness of this flight. We also had a special sign off and welcome home from the control towers in New York and Sydney, which you don\u2019t get every day.\n\n\"Overall, we\u2019re really happy with how the flight went and it\u2019s great have some of the data we need to help assess turning this into a regular service.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Qantas)\n\nAviation enthusiasts will need to wait a while before they can buy tickets for the route though.\n\nThe flight was a test for 'Project Sunrise', the airline's venture to operate regular, direct commercial flights from Australia's eastern coast to London and New York.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Qantas)\n\nIn fact, there are two more research flights planned; London to Sydney in November, and New York to Sydney in December.\n\nAt this stage there's no confirmation whether Qantas will go ahead with the services, although the airline has said it expects to make a decision by the end of the year, when the research flights are complete.\n\nThe tests will also include on board research to test ways of 'improving wellbeing on ultra long-haul flights' - although if you have a long flight planned soon, then you might want to check out our top tips for long-haul including easy ways to make the journey that little bit more comfortable.", "description": "Qantas broke records with the world's longest Dreamliner flight this week which touched down after nearly 20 hours in the air", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images For Qantas"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20666486.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Qantas-Set-For-World-First-Commercial-Airline-Non-Stop-Flight-From-New-York-To-Sydney.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
