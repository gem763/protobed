Nadal had two break points at 4-4, but Medvedev fought them off, the highlight a 28-shot rally that took both players to and fro until Nadal hit a forehand into the net.\n\nThat elicited cheers from the fans, who chanted Medvedev\u2019s name just a week after his brief villainous turn.\n\nWith Nadal serving at 5-6, Medved won the first three points, including a sizzling forehand down the line at 0-15 that caused the crowd to erupt. Then, at 15-40, he charged in to hit a backhand winner and take the set.\n\nIn the fourth set, Medvedev started to serve-and-volley more to shorten rallies, but the set proceeded on serve until the 10th game. With Nadal serving at 4-5, Medvedev sealed the 52-minute set with just the second return winner of the match, snapping a backhand down the line past an approaching Nadal.\n\nMedvedev had chances to pull ahead early in the fifth set, earning three break points in Nadal\u2019s first service game, all of which he saved.\n\nAt 2-2 in the fifth, Medvedev led, 40-0, on serve, before slipping, hitting three unforced errors in the next four points to give Nadal a break point. Medvedev saved that first break point with an ace, but Nadal earned a second two points later, and won it with a staggering 28-stroke rally that he sealed with a backhand winner.\n\nNadal consolidated the break with a hold for 4-2, finishing with a backhand volley winner. He earned a second break to go ahead by 5-2, but he was broken when serving for the championship, double-faulting on break point after losing his first serve for a time violation.", "description": "Nadal holds on for a five-set victory against Daniil Medvedev and is now one major championship away from tying Roger Federer\u2019s record.", "authors": ["David Waldstein"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/sports/08open-men-nadalwins-sub3/08open-men-nadalwins-sub3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
