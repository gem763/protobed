We've made some small tweaks to our own operations, by bringing forward our open market operations to assist with the provision of liquidity during that period.\"\n\nHe closed his remarks at the conference by saying the local financial system still had a long way to go when it came to transitioning away from Libor.\n\n\"[The phasing out of] Libor is fast approaching and we're already working hard with financial market participants here in Australia to get ready for that,\" he said. \"We've taken a lot of good steps to make sure BBSW is robust but users of BBSW may want to consider whether that's the best reference rate for their products.\n\n\"Cash products and loans, they're very bespoke and each has to be negotiated individually. There's a lot of work that needs to be done.\"", "description": "RBA assistant governor Christopher Kent has urged the financial sector to do more to prepare for the end of Libor, to which Australia has an estimated $7 trillion exposure.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_35/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/032b3963cf32469aba152c455981bf691188799d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
