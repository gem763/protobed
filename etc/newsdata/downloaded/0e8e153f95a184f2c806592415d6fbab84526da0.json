I am sorry but it would never happen on a plane.\n\n\u2018There must have been other seats on that train for them to sit.\u2019\n\nWhen asked if Carol would give up her seat to a pregnant woman, she added: \u2018I would say no. It\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re pregnant, I mean you\u2019re pregnant, not ill.\u2019\n\nCarol\u2019s opinion has left viewers divided on the controversial topic \u2013 and in true fashion, they have taken to Twitter to talk about it.\n\nOne viewer tweeted: \u2018I absolutely would give up my seat for a pregnant woman because if they were to fall or anything happened to them or the baby I\u2019d never forgive myself.\u2019\n\nAnother added: \u2018Pregnant women are pregnant, not ill. Boils my blood when people say this, especially as I\u2019m 20 weeks into a difficult pregnancy and still throwing up all day every day.\u2019\n\nViewers were outraged (Picture: Twitter)\n\nOne said: \u2018Yes a woman may choose to be pregnant but at the end of the day YOU can also choose to show a little kindness and offer her your seat.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother viewer raged \u2018Pregnant people are not ill \u2013 correct! But they do go through a lot of anatomical and physiological changes that put them at risk of collapses. I believe pregnant women should be offered a seat on a train or bus if they fell over and injuries could occur.\u2019\n\nWould you give your seat up for a pregnant woman? (Picture: Twitter)\n\nOne fan pointed out: \u2018What if the previous train was cancelled ?! All reserved seats out the window. Do we know the full story here?!\u2019\n\nAlthough some viewers have backed Carol. One said: \u2018I\u2019m with Carol here! I pay for and reserve my seat because even though it may look it\u2026I\u2019m not able to stand\u2026so if you need a seat do the same.\u2019\n\nAnother tweeted: \u2018Why can\u2019t a pregnant woman stand up? They aren\u2019t dying!! Kick the kids off the seats and then sit down. Stupid to moan about it.\u2019\n\nLoose Women airs weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
