It not only marks the 70th anniversary of the PRC founding, but also the start of the new era \"Reiwa\" for Japan. He firmly believes that Japan and China's joint responses to regional and global issues as well as joint contributions to the international community are of great significance to the future of the two countries.\n\nEarlier this week, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan is seeking to deepen the Japan-China ties that have returned to a \"normal track\" as both nations share a responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and beyond.", "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has vowed to open up a new era in Japan-China relationship and push bilateral ties to \"a new stage.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/05/5d98706aa310cf3e979fd763.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
