As training camps get underway Trysta Krick digests, debriefs and explains all the crazy moves made with a map. Take notes and get ready. USA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Before fans could settle into their seats, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry thought of something that would keep them standing. He would heave a long-distance 3-pointer to open the game.\n\nCurry has made those enough times during his 10-year NBA career. So why not try to rile up the crowd that way? When Curry launched a 31-foot runner only 22 seconds into the Warriors\u2019 first game at Chase Center, however, the shot hit nothing but air.\n\n\u201cI was going to shoot it up and christen Chase Center the right way,\u201d Curry said with a grin afterwards. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t want to airball. But I thought it was fitting to take a wild shot like that and get everybody excited.\u201d\n\nSteph Curry really pulled up from 45 feet for his first shot attempt at Chase Center \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 pic.twitter.com/q5lQOaKvDb \u2014 TheWarriorsTalk (@TheWarriorsTalk) October 6, 2019\n\nAs the Warriors discovered in their 123-101 preseason loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday, the fans\u2019 excitement often depended on the Warriors\u2019 play.\n\nThe Warriors\u2019 lineup introductions mostly sparked just golf claps until the public service announcer yelled out Draymond Green's and Curry's names. Those represent the Warriors\u2019 two remaining stars after Kevin Durant departed for Brooklyn and Klay Thompson remains sidelined with an injured left knee.\n\nIn related news, the Lakers stormed out to an 11-0 lead while the Warriors missed their first 10 shots. The crowd muttered occasionally with disgust. Otherwise, they sounded mostly subdued. That changed when the Warriors prompted the Lakers to call timeout after trimming their lead to 45-41 with 3:53 left in the second quarter. Then, the Warriors crowd acted like they were at Oracle Arena, the venue the Warriors played at full-time since 1971.\n\n\u201cWhen we had a couple of runs, it was awesome,\u201d Warriors president & chief operating officer Rick Welts told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThe runs you can really feel it. That\u2019s what we hope we feel. I think it\u2019ll get better from here. That will be the logical thought.\u201d\n\nMore: Rockets GM Daryl Morey tries to defuse tenuous spot with China after Hong Kong tweet\n\nMore: Award picks, team predictions for 2019-20 NBA season\n\nPreseason power rankings:: Where do new-look Clippers, Lakers, 76ers fall?\n\nWelts planned to talk with other team officials following the Warriors\u2019 preseason opener. They have done that plenty of times since the Warriors broke ground nearly 2\u00bd years ago to build a privately financed area budgeted for $1 billion. The Warriors eventually spent $1.5 billion, thanks to majority owner Joe Lacob and co-owner Peter Guber refusing to spare any expense.\n\nSome of those items? Chase Center has the NBA\u2019s largest scoreboard that fully retracts into the ceiling and displays various statistics and replays from different angles. Chase Center has more suites (136) than Oracle Arena (84), including theater boxes (60), courtside lounges (32) and suites around the lower bowl (44). And the arena has a sound system that can accommodate concerts, which have included Metallica, Elton John, Janet Jackson, Dave Matthews Band and Eric Clapton.\n\n\u201cPlayers are genuinely excited to be here for basketball,\u201d Welts said. \u201cThat\u2019s great that Elton John loves the building. But we need our fans, Steph Curry and a few others to love the building.\u201d\n\nSeemingly on cue, Warriors general manager Bob Myers then walked past Welts near one of the entrance tunnels. Myers yelled out to Welts and a reporter, \u201cI think it\u2019s great! I think it\u2019s the best!\u201d\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry warms up before the game against the Los Angeles Lakers at Chase Center.

Just like the Warriors experienced with their play in the preseason opener, they have a few adjustments to make with the new arena.\n\nBefore almost every game at Oracle Arena, Curry completed a shooting routine that included more than just hoisting 3-pointers, mid-range jumpers and free throws. He often ended his workout by tossing shots from the players\u2019 entrance tunnel, which was parallel to the Warriors\u2019 basket. At Chase Center, the Warriors have all of their entrance tunnels on each corner of the building.\n\n\u201cThe only thing for me is the tunnel shot,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThat was fun. So I have to figure that out.\u201d\n\nKerr joked that he's struggling to figure out directions and traffic patterns during his commute from his San Francisco home to Chase Center. \"I got Waze going on my phone and I have no idea where I\u2019m going,\u201d Kerr said. He's also struggled figuring out how to navigate the arena himself.\n\nBefore Saturday\u2019s game, Kerr had trouble finding his assistant coaches. He also conceded that \u201cthe first night here felt strange\u201d sitting in the Warriors\u2019 new press conference room.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t found our rhythm yet or our routine,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThat will take some time.\u201d\n\nThe Warriors\u2019 scoreboard occasionally posted wrong statistics. When the arena DJ played songs from Oakland-based rapper, Too $hort, the crowd barely reacted. The Warriors initially did not give fans much to cheer about with their play, either.\n\nNo wonder Lakers coach Frank Vogel joked, \u201cI liked the old building better.\u201d Yet, those words captured some truth. The Warriors and their opponents remembered Oracle Arena more for how it sounded and less for how it looked. The Warriors left Oracle Arena because they wanted to open up new revenue streams and moved out of a building that remained outdated with its upkeep and amenities.\n\n\u201cJust the noise. The fan support they got there in an older arena sounded different when they were going on runs,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t really hear yourself or think or talk or anything like that. It\u2019s tough to communicate with your players.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers had no problem communicating with each other against the Warriors on Saturday. Partly credit Lakers star Anthony Davis for finishing with 22 points on 9-of-16 shooting and 10 rebounds in only 18 minutes \u2013 all in the first half. Partly attribute the Warriors for not having the same roster that won them three NBA championships in the past five years. Beyond losing Durant and fielding an injured Thompson, the Warriors have a few other glaring absences. They traded veteran Andre Iguodala to Memphis because of salary cap restrictions. The Warriors\u2019 other trusted veteran, Shaun Livingston, retired. They also enter training camp without a definitive center because of injuries to Willie Cauley-Stein (left foot) and Kevon Looney (right hamstring).\n\nWelts noted that about 45% of fans have used public transportation to ease congestion. Nonetheless, the Warriors built an arena that would make it more difficult logistically and financially for Oakland residents to attend than it is for the tech investors around San Francisco.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to upgrade. But I just feel for Oakland,\u201d said Lakers guard Quinn Cook, who played for the Warriors in the previous two seasons. \u201cI felt for that building because I watched my whole life great moments in the NBA, great moments in that building. Obviously they built it for the better. They did a great job.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, Warriors players and officials alike noticed immediately the similarities between Chase Center and Oracle Arena. Both venues have the same court, the same lineup introductions and the same game operations. So even if the Warriors wanted to construct a modern arena that could host 200 events per year, including concerts, political conventions and an eventual NBA All-Star game, the Warriors admittedly wanted to keep some traces of Oracle Arena.\n\n\u201cWe all cherish the atmosphere that we\u2019ve had there,\u201d Welts said. \u201cThe more we could bring the best of what Oracle had and then add a lot of experience that people couldn\u2019t have there because of limitations of the arena.\u201d\n\nAs the Warriors and Lakers built an on-court rhythm, they soon appreciated what the arena offered. Warriors guard D\u2019Angelo Russell described Chase Center with having a \u201cbrand new smell\u201d and observed that \u201cthe rims felt like they were brand new.\u201d Green liked that the Warriors placed their lockers next to a weight-training room. Kerr observed the Warriors\u2019 circular locker room provides a more intimate setting for players.\n\nJust like the Warriors anticipate improvement with their play, they also sense they will become more comfortable with their arena as time passes. With a Central Subway System planned to be complete in January, Welts has maintained optimism that traffic congestion will improve continuously. Just like most teams treat preseason games, the Warriors plan to showcase more undisclosed features once the regular season starts.\n\n\u201cWe have everything we need here in terms of pregame prep. When we practice here we have all the bells and whistles to get ready for games,\u201d Curry said. \u201cFans will get used to Chase Center. So, the energy and noise will get comparable to Oracle, if not louder. So I\u2019m excited about that.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that happens, it would not hurt if Curry nails that long-distance 3-pointer. Warriors fans will readily cheer for that regardless of the setting.\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "The Warriors had mixed feelings about playing at the new Chase Center for the first time on Saturday night.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published P.M.
