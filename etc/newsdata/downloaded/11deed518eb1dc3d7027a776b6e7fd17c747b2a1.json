It\u2019s also been featured with Hagar on TV and in several photoshoots.\n\nOffers for the car are being accepted by e-mail and the minimum bid is $55,000, which is a fair amount more than a typical El Camino is worth. Still, they\u2019re not often sold by celebrities for charity, and this one comes with a guitar and autographed bottles from Hagar\u2019s mezquila and rum brands.\n\nBids are being accepted through Sept. 25, and the winner will be announced the following day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "All for a good cause.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
