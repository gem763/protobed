REUTERS/Rick Wilking (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS REAL ESTATE) More\n\nNew home sales rose again in August as a the drop in mortgage rates starts to benefit the U.S. housing market. Analysts are expecting that Lennar will exceed 4% growth in net new orders during the third quarter given the rebound in new home demand. Lennar\u2019s results comes as the homebuilders have been outperforming the broader market in a lower interest rate environment. The ETF tracking the homebuilders, XHB, jumped nearly 37% in 2019, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 20% in the same time period.\n\nMeanwhile, after the market close, retailer Bed Bath & Beyond will release fiscal second-quarter financial results. The embattled retailer has a lot to prove to investors given that the stock has tanked 82% over the past five years and 27% over the past year. Bed Bath & Beyond still has yet to appoint a permanent CEO, and investors will be expecting to hear additional details on the recent board shake up and layoffs.\n\nAnalysts polled by Bloomberg expect Bed Bath & Beyond to report adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share on $2.75 billion in revenue. The options market is implying a 19% move in either direction following the report.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
