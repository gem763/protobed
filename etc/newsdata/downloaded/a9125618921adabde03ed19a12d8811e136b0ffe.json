The two neighbors and friends bonded for life when Seigneur donated her kidney to Courtney.\n\nIowa resident Janine Russell happened to be watching that segment.\n\nHer daughter, Shelley Skuster, wrote to \"GMA\" and said, \"The story on GMA gave my mom a nudge to request paperwork on what being a living kidney donor entailed. After watching it, she thought donating a kidney was simply something she could do.\"\n\nAs it turned out, a co-worker of Russell's daughter was in desperate need of a kidney. Sone Xaykose of Des Moines, Iowa, a stranger to Russell, became the recipient of Russell's life-saving gift.\n\n\"All I could think about is this is something that I think I can do and it's something that I want to do,\" Russell told \"GMA.\"\n\nThe surgery was a success and two days later, donor and recipient met for the first time.\n\nXaykose said Russell \"saved her life. She's heaven sent. She's my angel.\"\n\nIt's a beautiful story of how one selfless deed inspired another.\n\n\"Why can't I do that. Why can't I make a difference,\" Russell said of learning about Seigneur and Courtney. The segment, she said, \"empowered me to be able to do it.\"", "description": "A woman inspired by a", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190906_gma_kidney2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
