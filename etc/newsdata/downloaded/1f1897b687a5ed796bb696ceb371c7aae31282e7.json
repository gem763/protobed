Esper (@EsperDoD) September 16, 2019 Report\n\nIran has discounted the possibility of a meeting between President Rouhani and President Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly next week.\n\nThere had previously been speculation that they could meet to defuse tensions.\n\nHow have others reacted?\n\nUN Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Monday it was \"not entirely clear\" who was behind the strike but that it had increased the chances of a regional conflict.\n\nIn the UK, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also highlighted the uncertainty, while calling the act a \"wanton violation of international law\".\n\nChina and the European Union have, separately, urged restraint.\n\nWhat happened to oil markets?\n\nThe oil price saw its biggest one-day rise since the 1991 Gulf War, soaring 20% but falling back later.\n\nThe international benchmark used by traders, Brent crude, jumped to $71.95 (\u00a357.53) a barrel at one point.\n\nPrices eased after President Trump authorised a possible release of US reserves.\n\nUS Energy Secretary Rick Perry told business channel CNBC that it was too early to tell if this would be necessary.\n\nThere are concerns that higher prices could continue if tensions worsen further. Mr Trump has tried to downplay the impact on the market.\n\nHow did the attacks unfold?\n\nThe attacks targeted Abqaiq, the site of the world's largest oil processing plant, run by the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, and the Khurais oilfield.\n\nKhurais is the closest of the targets to the Yemen border, but is still a considerable 770km (480 miles) away.\n\nUS officials said there were 19 points of impact on the targets, which could have come from a mix of drones and cruise missiles.\n\nThey have told media outlets that they believe the attacks did not originate from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, which lies to the south-west of the Saudi oil facilities, and instead were launched from the north or north-west.\n\nThe officials said that could suggest launch sites in the northern Gulf, Iran or Iraq but no conclusive evidence has been provided.\n\nIraq denied at the weekend that the attacks were launched from its territory. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said the US assured him in a phone call on Monday that it backed Iraq's position.\n\nWhy Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a fierce struggle for regional dominance.\n\nThe decades-old feud is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main branches of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power.\n\nThe two countries are not directly fighting but they are engaged in a variety of proxy wars (conflicts where they support rival sides and militias) around the region.\n\nRead more about Saudi-Iranian relations\n\nWhy might the Houthis have attacked Saudi Arabia?\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia. The attacks have left at least four civilians dead.\n\nThe Yemen conflict escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.\n\nSaudi Arabia and allies then began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government.\n\nThe UN says the conflict has claimed the lives of at least 7,290 civilians and left 80% of the population - 24 million people - in need of humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive.", "description": "There are fears of escalating tensions in the region as Iran is blamed for strikes on oil facilities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nhw3f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
