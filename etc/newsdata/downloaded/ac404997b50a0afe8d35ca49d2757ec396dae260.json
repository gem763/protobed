Everyone was commenting on it. 2,000 people replied on the first day.\"\n\nShe spent the next three months going on up to three dates a week, meeting some really interesting people along the way.\n\nAnd she also learnt a lot about herself.\n\n(Image: Lumen)\n\n\"I just had the most incredible time. It wasn't about meeting someone, it was about realising how much fun it was being single.\n\n\"It made me appreciate myself a lot more. The conversations you have on first dates are different to conversations you have with any other part of life. You tell stories about yourself.\n\n\"It was all about how much fun you can have dating. I went on some really incredible dates and did some really fun things.\"\n\nShe started to blog about her dating journey, keeping all the guys anonymous, which led to her being offered work reviewing dating apps.\n\n(Image: Lumen)\n\nBefore long she had enough work to quit her job and work in the industry full time as a consultant, reviewer and expert.\n\nShe said: \"Over four years I tried and judged pretty much every dating app and site out there.\n\n\"I knew a lot about the industry and I was at the stage when I was quite ready to leave. It was something I fell into because of the blog.\n\n\"I had just launched an online platform trying to encourage more women to launch their own businesses.\"\n\nBut her plans changed when her friend approached her with an idea for a new app - Lumen.\n\nThe app would be exclusively for people over the age of 50, with extra security and advice, but without being patronising or boring.\n\n\"I worked in dating for so long that everyone I knew came to me with dating questions. One of the most common questions was people asking me about their mums and dads. I would honestly say not to use any of the apps.\n\n(Image: Lumen)\n\n\"I knew there was a market for it. I knew just from my own friends.\n\n\"I'm now 35, and I think the older you get the harder it is to meet like minded people.\n\n\"There were people in their 50s and 60s who needed it. It's ridiculous how ageist society is.\n\n\"There is such a warped view of what a 50-year-old looks like. I think most people see them in their heads as a 70-year-old.\n\n\"I really want Lumen to champion pro-age. I think for too long we've talked about ageing as a bad thing.\n\n\"We live in a world where 50 is really young. We're really fortunate that 50 is middle-aged now.\"\n\nThe app launched in the UK last September and will be out in the US in April.\n\n\"It has been really exciting. It's only when I take a step back that I appreciate how much we've achieved.\"\n\n(Image: Lumen)\n\n(Image: Lumen)\n\nThere have already been three weddings from people meeting on the app and Charly is still very hands on with the members.\n\nCharly said: \"How cool is that? We're actually changing people's lives. If we didn't have this idea last year these people probably wouldn't have met let alone got married. It makes me grin.\n\n\"I probably speak to about 100 members day, they can ask me for dating advice. It makes my morning when I open my phone.\n\nGiven their target market, one of their biggest focuses is safety.\n\nCharly explains: \"A lot of people over 50 are quite worried about online technology. They're the most targeted by scammers and catfisher.\n\n\"We needed safety to be a key part.\"\n\nTheir app includes a number of clever features including a selfie checker, where you take a photo which is compared to your profile picture to check you're using real photos.\n\nThis also includes an age check, so a 20-year-old can't pose as a 50-year-old.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Charly Lester asked her friends to act Cupid as a bit of fun - but it has completely changed her life and she's even launched her own dating app Lumen", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Lumen"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20649188.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_181019SLUG_6817JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
