Older Voters Love That She's Different", "language": "en", "text": "For Sen. Elizabeth Warren in New Hampshire, the challenge is clear: in an early primary state where Sen. Bernie Sanders won 60% of the vote in 2016, she needs to both cut into his young progressive base and expand her appeal to older voters who may have picked Clinton in 2016.\n\nEven though Sanders and Warren are friends and ideological allies, the two senators are circling each other in the Democratic presidential primary, often discussed in reference to one another and competing for overlapping groups of voters. In dozens of conversations with Warren supporters in New Hampshire on Thursday, Sanders repeatedly emerged as a reference point: younger voters said they supported Warren because of her similarities to Sanders, while older voters said they supported her because of her differences from him. Most of her younger supporters said they had supported Sanders in 2016 (even if they hadn\u2019t been eligible to vote yet), while most of the older supporters had supported Clinton.\n\nSanders\u2019s campaign is on the upswing again after his heart attack in early October. His campaign has been focusing on expanding the electorate of voters, with a strong debate showing and a major Queens rally featuring a coveted endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and he plans to return to campaign in New Hampshire this week.\n\nWhile Sanders won New Hampshire in 2016 by more than 20 points, Warren is currently leading in the state by a hair, partly because of her cross-generational support: in a recent Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll, young voters supported Sanders at nearly twice the rate of older ones, but voters of all ages supported Warren at roughly equal rates.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg earlier this year. \u201cWarren is cutting into the backbone of [Sanders] field organization in \u201915 and \u201916.\u201d\n\nMore than a thousand people came to Warren\u2019s event on Thursday at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., and students waited in line to take a selfie with the Senator and to pet her dog Bailey. Sanders came to Dartmouth in late September and spoke to a crowd that was roughly the same size, and many of the students at the Warren event said they had also gone to the Sanders one.\n\nSome said they supported Warren because they saw her as Sanders\u2019s natural heir. \u201cI love Bernie,\u201d said Jackson Harris, a 21-year-old geography and computer science major at Dartmouth. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of really great things in his life, but this is not his time for the Presidency. It\u2019s time for Warren to get it done.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so old, and Warren\u2019s so similar to him,\u201d said Harris\u2019s friend Juan Lainez, a 21-year-old senior majoring in government and Latin American studies. \u201cEveryone who was for Bernie four years ago is now for Warren.\u201d\n\nUnderneath it all, the students said they wanted someone who could win. \u201cI think Warren can pull it off,\u201d says Em Morris, a 22-year-old graduate student in experimental and molecular medicine who enthusiastically supported Sanders in 2016. \u201cAny of them can win, but I think Warren will put up the best fight.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, at an event at Newport Opera House in Newport, N.H., Warren gave a nearly identical speech to a much older crowd, but the selfie line was just as long. Here, the crowd was full of people who had voted for Clinton in 2016, who were skeptical of Sanders\u2019s far-left ideology and saw Warren as a more practical alternative. Many were senior citizens themselves who were concerned about Sanders\u2019s age.\n\n\u201cBernie\u2019s not a bad guy, but she\u2019s more plan-oriented,\u201d says Sally Caltrider, a 65-year-old registered nurse who voted for Clinton in the 2016 primary. \u201cI was upset with Bernie at the end of the primary last time, I don\u2019t think he did enough to support Hillary.\u201d Besides, she added, \u201chis health concerns me.\u201d Other older voters shared that concern. \u201cBernie\u2019s too old,\u201d said Lisa Matthews, 64, \u201cI wish he\u2019d get outta there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she can\u2019t beat Trump, nobody can,\u201d said Mary Edes, 71, a retired teacher who also voted for Clinton in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s not going to be a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think some people think she\u2019s too far left, but if people listened to her, they will come away with a different opinion,\u201d says Cindy Martin, a 66-year-old retiree. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s aligned with the far-left socialists. She\u2019s not as far left as Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nOther older supporters said they were heartened by Warren\u2019s ability to reach the young. \u201cI think she\u2019ll inspire the base of the party,\u201d said Benson Bobrick, a 72-year-old historian who traveled to Newport to hear Warren speak. \u201cYoung people in particular.\u201d\n\nWrite to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com.", "description": "Even though Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are friends and ideological allies, the two Senators are circling each other in New Hampshire", "authors": ["Charlotte Alter", "Newport Nh"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/elizabeth-warren-nh.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
