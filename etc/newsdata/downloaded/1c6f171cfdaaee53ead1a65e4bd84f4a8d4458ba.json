He tried to stand up to greet me but had his leg in a cast.\n\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nHe was full of random facts: apparently each Wetherspoon has its own carpet, which is designed by the same person. Every day is a school day, he said, tapping his nose.\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nMy friend messaged me, asking me to send her a voice note from the toilet to debrief the date, and he saw it pop up on my phone.\n\nGood table manners?\n\nHe said he\u2019d save me a bite of pudding, but polished the whole thing off.\n\nBest thing about Greg?\n\nHis laugh was the loudest I\u2019ve heard.\n\nWould you introduce him to your friends?\n\n100%. They\u2019d love him on a dancefloor.\n\nDescribe Greg in three words\n\nNutty, bubbly, warm.\n\nWhat do you think he made of you?\n\nI feel that we gelled quite well \u2013 we spent a lot of time laughing.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nWe walked/hobbled to a pub down the road.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nNo, we were on the tube and it was really busy.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nI\u2019d want to go on for a dance somewhere.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\n8.5.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nMaybe.\n\nGreg on Helena\n\nWhat were you hoping for?\n\nTo meet someone funny, cute and intelligent \u2013 combined with an evening devoid of embarrassment and/or awkward silences.\n\nFirst impressions?\n\nFar less nervous than I was. Tall, pretty and instantly engaging.\n\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nMy recently snapped achilles tendon, family, travelling, career aspirations, Helena\u2019s love of horticulture, my complete lack of creative flair, and how to utilise certain office paraphernalia to avoid engaging with colleagues when hungover.\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nNone, although I did accidentally touch her knee a few times as I was gesticulating (that sounds dodgy).\n\nGood table manners?\n\nVery good.\n\nBest thing about Helena?\n\nHer infectious personality.\n\nWould you introduce her to your friends?\n\nSure, I think they would all like her.\n\nDescribe Helena in three words\n\nFunny, chatty, interesting.\n\nBlind date: \u2018We could do karaoke together and make cats cry\u2019 Read more\n\nWhat do you think she made of you?\n\nShe laughed a lot and seemed quite impressed with my love of cooking \u2013 so hopefully she thought well of me.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nWe went to a pub and had a couple of pints.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nWe did not.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nNothing, we got on fantastically and the food was incredible.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\n8.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nAs friends. I didn\u2019t feel any romance, unfortunately.\n\n\u2022 Helena and Greg ate at Cafe Murano, London WC2. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com.
