In the U.S., S&P 500 futures were down 0.68%\n\nMarkets continued to react to disappointing economic data published Tuesday showing manufacturing activity was at its lowest point in a decade in the U.S. The figures came on top of downbeat data from the European Union, China and Japan.\n\nSteel giant ArcelorMittal and Finnish construction machinery maker Konecranes were both among the biggest losers in Europe, falling 3.1% and 4% respectively.\n\nGermany's leading economics research institutes jointly lowered their growth forecasts Wednesday for Europe's largest economy. They cited slowing global demand for capital goods, structural changes in the auto sector -- one of Germany's most important industries -- and political uncertainty.\n\n\"There hasn't been a single month this year where Germany has seen expansion in its manufacturing sector,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, who expects the weakness in manufacturing to spill over into the services sector.\n\nInvestors are being cautious and \"taking cash off the table\" ahead of services and employment figures later in the week, Mr. Hewson added.\n\nIf the manufacturing slowdown spreads to the still robust service sector, this would increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut rates again in October, said Stefan Schilbe, HSBC Germany's chief economist.\n\nBank stocks in Europe fell Wednesday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index down 1.2%, reflecting unease about falling bond yields, which crimp lender profits. Banks' performance is also seen as highly correlated with economic growth. Swiss bank UBS Group was down 1.7%.\n\nAmong individual stocks, shares in U.K. bookmaking business Flutter Entertainment rose 21% after it agreed to merge with Stars Group, creating an online betting giant worth more than $11 billion.\n\nEuropean luxury-goods stocks traded lower ahead of an expected World Trade Organization ruling on the extent of tariffs the U.S. would be allowed to impose on some European goods, including luxury items and airplanes. LVMH traded 2.2% lower, Burberry was down 2.7% and Kering traded 3% lower.\n\nIn Asia, Korea's Kospi was down nearly 2% following news that North Korea fired at least one missile off its east coast. The move, seen as a show of strength, came after Pyongyang said it would resume official nuclear talks with the U.S. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 0.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.2%. Mainland Chinese stock markets were closed for a holiday.\n\nIn commodities, oil futures for Brent crude fell 0.3% to $58.69 a barrel.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys was slightly lower at 1.625%, from 1.638% Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nLooking ahead, investors will eye the ADP National Employment Report for signs of any cracks in the U.S. job market. Plus, Ford Motor Co. will report third-quarter sales.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 02, 2019 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
