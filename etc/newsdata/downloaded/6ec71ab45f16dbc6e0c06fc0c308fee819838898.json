We've run through all of the extra ways you can save on Universal Credit below.\n\nCold Weather Payment\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nCold Weather Payments are paid out by the Government during times of especially freezing weather.\n\nThe money goes to people on low incomes who receive a qualifying benefit, such as pension credit or certain employment benefits, when temperatures sink to below 0\u00b0C in the area they live in.\n\nPayments are triggered by data collected by the Met Office from 94 weather stations around Britain.\n\nThe scheme runs each year from November 1 to March 31.\n\nIf you do qualify, you'll get a \u00a325 a week payment for every seven-day spell of cold weather you experience.\n\nThe money is paid to the recipient within 14 days.\n\nFind out more on Cold Weather Payments, here.\n\nFree NHS prescriptions\n\nGetting a prescription costs \u00a39 a time, a cost people on Universal Credit struggling to make ends meet could struggle to meet.\n\nIt's cheaper if you buy in bulk, with a three month prescription pass costing \u00a329.10 and an annual one \u00a3104 - but what if you didn't have to pay it at all?\n\nIt's well known that people under 16 or over 60 - as well women who are pregnant or new mums - don't have to pay, but it turns out quite a lot of people on benefits could qualify too.\n\nYou get free prescriptions if you're on Income Support, get income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance or Pension Credit Guarantee Credit.\n\nFind out how to claim, here.\n\nWarm Home Discount\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe Warm Home Discount is a support scheme aimed at households who may struggle to pay their energy bills.\n\nThe scheme was introduced by Government on April 1, 2011 and will run until 2021.\n\nIt's a one-off \u00a3140 discount on your energy bill over winter - but instead of being paid directly to you, it's automatically deducted from your bill over the winter months (between September and March).\n\nYou may also receive it as an energy rebate - all payments for last winter were paid by March 31, 2018. It's usually paid by Spring the following year, ie April 2020 for this coming winter.\n\nFind out more on the Warm Home Discount, here.\n\nAdvance Payments\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe most common form of support offered to claimants while moving onto Universal Credit is an 'Advance Payment' \u2013 a loan valued at up to 100% of your first Universal Credit payment, paid back through deductions in your monthly payments as soon as they begin.\n\nClaimants can choose the amount of Advance Payment they apply for, but they must be paid back within 12 months of the payment.\n\nYou can borrow up to 100% of your estimated payment to see you through the transitional period, but this will have to be paid back.\n\nFrom October 2021, the Government plans to change the repayment period to 16 months, to improve affordability.\n\nTo get an advance payment, you can either speak to your work coach at the job centre or apply by calling the helpline on 0800 328 5644, Monday to Friday between 8am and 6pm.\n\nFind out more on Universal Credit Advance Payments, here.\n\nHardship Payments\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIf you've been sanctioned - and your payments have been stopped as a result - you might qualify for a hardship payment.\n\nClaimants can get around 60% of the amount they were sanctioned by in the last month to cover the costs of rent, heating, food or hygiene needs.\n\nLike the advanced payment, you'll need to pay a hardship payment back through your Universal Credit payments.\n\nTo apply, contact the Universal Credit helpline on 0800 328 9344.\n\nFind out more on Hardship Payments - and how to appeal sanctions, here.\n\nAlternative Payment Arrangement\n\nYour landlord might be able to apply for an alternative payment arrangement (APA) if you're falling behind on your rent.\n\nThe type of help you could get includes:\n\nGetting your rent paid directly to your landlord.\n\nGetting paid more frequently than once a month.\n\nReceiving split payments, if you\u2019re part of a couple.\n\nYou'll need to talk to your work coach at the JobCentre Plus to apply for an APA.\n\nBudgeting Advance\n\nA sudden or unexpected bill is enough to throw anyone's finances into chaos - and often accounts for why many people turn to rip-off payday lenders or illegal loan sharks for money in desperation.\n\nHowever, if you're on a low income and receive certain benefits, you may be able to get a Budgeting Loan to tide you over until payday.\n\nThis is a type of loan offered by the Government and can help you pay for household items, clothes, rent in advance, maintenance, improvements or security for your home, travel, funeral costs and even loans taken out for any of the above.\n\nYou\u2019re only eligible for a Budgeting Loan if you've been on certain benefits for six months - such as Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance and Pension Credit.\n\nIf you've been switched onto Universal Credit from Pension Credit, any time spent claiming for it will count towards the six months.\n\nHowever, you cannot get a Budgeting Loan if you've already been rolled onto Universal Credit (that's where advance payments come in), you\u2019re involved in a strike or you already owe more than \u00a31,500 in total for Crisis Loans and Budgeting Loans.\n\nThe lowest amount you can borrow is \u00a3100. However, this rises to \u00a3348 if you\u2019re single, \u00a3464 if you have a partner and \u00a3812 if you or your partner claims Child Benefit.\n\nHow much you could get depends on whether you can pay the loan back, have savings of more than \u00a31,000 (\u00a32,000 if you or your partner are 63 or over) or are paying back an existing Budgeting Loan or Crisis Loan.\n\nA Budgeting Loan is interest free so you only pay back what you borrow.\n\nThe repayments will be taken automatically from your benefits. The amounts you repay are based on how much benefit you get and what you can afford.\n\nYou normally have to repay the loan within 2 years (104 weeks).\n\nFind out more on the Budgeting Loan, here.", "description": "This winter, the average household will spend \u00a3402.99 on energy bills - but what are your options if you can't afford it?", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20387359.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Currency.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
