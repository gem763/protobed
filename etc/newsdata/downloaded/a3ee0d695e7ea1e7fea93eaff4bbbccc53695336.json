NO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cDid Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\u201d\n\nTrump repeatedly characterizes his Zelensky call as \u201cperfect,\u201d but the whistleblower\u2019s complaint noted how some White House officials were so concerned about Trump\u2019s actions on the call that they sought to severely restrict access to its record.\n\nThe White House memo of the call shows Trump sought a \u201cfavor\u201d from Zelensky. Democrats say it was a demand to investigate Joe Biden \u2014 the president\u2019s potential 2020 election rival \u2014 and a Ukrainian firm that hired Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nHouse Democrat Jamie Raskin said he believes Hill could shed light on what he described as \u201ca very powerful shadow foreign policy being operated out of Ukraine by the president\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u201d that bypassed normal channels in order to apply coercive pressure on Kiev.\n\n\u201cI think that she would have a comprehensive overview of that whole situation,\u201d Raskin told MSNBC.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Donald Trump demanded Monday that a whistleblower whose warning about the US president\u2019s call with Ukraine triggered the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/ca5577_fiona-hill-special-assistant-us-president-donald-trump-on-russian-affairs-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
