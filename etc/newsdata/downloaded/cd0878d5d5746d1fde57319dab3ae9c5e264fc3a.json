It\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s the opposite of miserablist. At the story\u2019s centre is a group of year 11 girls and the star is Bukky Bakray, playing a Nigerian British girl nicknamed \u201cRocks\u201d, who is maybe no great academic high-flier but really talented at cosmetics. Her dad is dead and she lives with her troubled mum, who has had, as a social worker delicately puts it, issues managing her medication.\n\nOrdinary Love review \u2013 Liam Neeson and Lesley Manville in potent weepie Read more\n\nIt is Rocks who largely has the responsibility of minding her kid brother, Emmanuel, gloriously played by D\u2019Angelou Osei Kissiedu \u2013 and Emmanuel is a black-belt scene-stealer. He starts the film the way he means to go on, with a hilarious setpiece. Asking if he may say grace before dinner, Emmanuel launches into his own version of the Lord\u2019s Prayer: \u201cOur father \u2013 he\u2019s up in heaven.\u201d Rocks cheerfully calls that his \u201cremix\u201d. But there\u2019s real trouble when Rocks\u2019s mum absents herself from the family home.\n\n\n\nThe odyssey of Rocks and Emmanuel \u2013 who in effect go on the run, fugitives from the world of grownup authority \u2013 provides a motor that drives the film but, in a way, its best moments come when Rocks and her friends are doing nothing more dramatically significant than just hanging out, talking and laughing. Occasionally these scenes erupt into something defiant, as when a food fight monumentally kicks off in the middle of a home economics class or when a girl tells her grumpy teacher: \u201cYou\u2019re like this because you\u2019ve got your period, sir.\u201d (He furiously replies: \u201cThat\u2019s actually really offensive.\u201d)\n\n\n\nBut really, the improv-type dialogue doesn\u2019t need to go anywhere or do anything to be hugely entertaining and watchable. The group around Rocks are capable, in the best possible way, of laughing about nothing, laughing from sheer directionless joy. The sadness, when it comes, is piercing \u2013 yet so is Rocks\u2019s resilience and her philosophical acceptance. Bukky Bakray gives a very moving portrayal of someone who has boldly accepted maternal responsibility for Emmanuel at the very moment that she is to be deprived of it.\n\n\n\nOf course, there is a larger sadness here: the realisation that the sheer energy and dynamism of this group is likely to be dissipated and wasted when they leave school \u2013 society will probably not find a way to tap this resource. When the class is taught about Picasso and cubism and they make spoof Picasso cut-out images of people\u2019s faces cut from magazines, it is a funny moment, but serious too, because there is a real sense of potential. This film is such a rush of vitality. It rocks.", "description": "The East London-set drama boasts wit, a dynamic cast and a piercing sadness as it follows a Nigerian British girl and her younger brother", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9003840d661d2fd9064b5ef21d3cf8c008a2f9b8/162_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8a8900acc002135ada7915a619ecaede", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
