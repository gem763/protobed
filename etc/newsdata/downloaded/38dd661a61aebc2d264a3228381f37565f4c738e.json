President Trump\u2019s campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate his domestic enemies follows this pattern. While Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani was leaning on the government in Kiev, he was simultaneously running a side hustle trying to extort the Ukrainians into throwing some energy business at his clients.\n\nSome of the facts surrounding Rudy\u2019s energy scam trickled out over the weekend, but the most damning revelations were contained in an explosive Associated Press story Sunday evening. If it were not a sidecar to a historic scandal, the energy scam would itself constitute a large enough scandal to bring most presidencies to their knees.\n\nThis is the basic outline of the story: While he was representing Trump as a lawyer, Giuliani was being paid by two men who were seeking business with Ukraine\u2019s government. Giuliani was wearing two hats: simultaneously representing the president of the United States and his paid clients. The conflict of interest between the two roles is overt. Giuliani\u2019s clients could use his name to leverage Ukraine to give them business.\n\nThe discrete details of the episode look even shadier. Two Soviet \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, have been trying to sell liquified natural gas to Ukraine. A profile of Parnas and Fruman by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project depicts both men as lacking any real background in energy. Fruman, according to the profile, has a number of links to the Russian Mafia. Parnas and Fruman donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party, hired Giuliani, and spent months trying to get a piece of the gas market in Ukraine. Giuliani does not disclose his clients and refused to answer whether Parnas and Fruman are paying him, but on Twitter he has identified both men as his clients.\n\nParnas and Fruman, along with a third partner, approached an executive at the state-owned Ukrainian energy firm with an offer to sell him up to 100 tanker shipments a year of liquefied natural gas, while touting their connections with Trump. The Ukrainian \u201cperceived it to be a shakedown,\u201d the AP reports.\n\nJohn Dowd \u2014 the former Trump lawyer who also represents Parnas and Fruman \u2014 tells the AP the whole approach was completely aboveboard. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a shakedown; it was an attempt to do legitimate business that didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nBut given the circumstances, the two legitimate businessmen could not possibly have proposed an innocent transaction. Ukraine was under military threat from Russia. Its government was desperately seeking both diplomatic support from Washington (in the form of a meeting between the two presidents, which would send a signal to Russia to back off) as well as military aid. They wouldn\u2019t have needed to threaten to break somebody\u2019s legs, and almost certainly didn\u2019t make any threats, because the threat was already coming from Russia. Any deal the Ukrainians made with people representing the American government was inherently extortive.\n\nAnd Parnas and Fruman were absolutely representing Trump at the time. As BuzzFeed reported in July, Parnas and Fruman held at least four meetings with Ukrainian prosecutors to urge investigations of Trump\u2019s enemies, and met with both President Trump and Donald Trump Jr.\n\nSo Parnas and Fruman were meeting with Ukrainian officials, representing Trump and his political demands. The Ukrainians knew they had an existential need to placate Trump. And at the same time they were doing this, Parnas and Fruman were also pushing Ukraine to throw some natural-gas import business their way.\n\nGiuliani tells the AP that he did not personally solicit a business deal in Ukraine: \u201cI have not pursued a deal in the Ukraine. I don\u2019t know about a deal in the Ukraine. I would not do a deal in the Ukraine now, obviously. There is absolutely no proof that I did it, because I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he insists, continuing his well-known habit of framing his denials in the most suspicious-sounding terms.\n\nIt\u2019s probably true that Rudy didn\u2019t negotiate the gas deal in Ukraine himself. And as he recently told the Post, his work for Trump is free. (\u201cMy other clients are paying me for the work I do for them. Nobody is paying me for a single thing I\u2019m doing for Donald J. Trump.\u201d) But the people who are paying Rudy did negotiate a gas deal.\n\nGiuliani is representing Trump for free, but his status as Trump\u2019s lawyer gave him enormous economic value to Parnas and Fruman. And Parnas and Fruman were also not paid to represent Trump\u2019s political agenda in Ukraine. But this generous pro bono use of their time as freelance diplomats was also highly advantageous. It gave them the chance to pitch business deals mixed together with diplomacy. The Ukrainians surely got the message that making Trump happy meant making Giuliani happy, and making Giuliani happy meant making Parnas and Fruman happy.\n\nTheir efforts to intertwine their business agenda with the Trump political agenda were so successful that Energy Secretary Rick Perry brought up their interests in his negotiations with Ukraine. Trump told Republicans that his July 25 call with President Zelensky was Perry\u2019s idea. \u201cThe only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to,\u201d he said on a conference call. \u201cSomething about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant.\u201d Perry met with Parnas and Fruman and reportedly asked Ukrainians to place a couple of Americans on the board of the state gas company. \u201cI may or may not know anything about it,\u201d Giuliani tells Politico, in yet another not-very-innocent-sounding quote. But Perry was pretty clearly not running the strategy.\n\nThe attempted gas deal is a sideshow to the larger scandal, which is about Trump using his office to push a foreign government to smear his domestic rivals. But it\u2019s an important subplot in its own right. Trump needed freelance operators to extort Ukraine because the normal foreign-policy apparatus is not set up to shake down foreign countries for dirt on the president\u2019s enemies. He couldn\u2019t pay Giuliani, Parnas, and Fruman to do this for him. But the arrangement allowed them to seek reimbursement by free riding off Trump\u2019s threats. They could add their gas deal onto the payment terms Trump was demanding from Ukraine.\n\nThe fact that Trump has been casting this campaign as an effort to root out \u201ccorruption\u201d while Rudy\u2019s boys were asking for a taste of the action just makes the whole joke funnier.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, represented two former-Soviet businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who negotiated for a gas deal in Ukraine while pushing its government to investigate Trump\u2019s enemies.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chait"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/07/07-ukraine-mafia-style-shakedown.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
