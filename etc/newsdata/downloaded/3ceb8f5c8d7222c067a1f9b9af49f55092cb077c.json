Robb) was pushed into the water by the sail of her boat as Cain (Jeff Hordley) scuffled with Nate (Jurell Carter).\n\nIt came following the explosive bombshell that Nate was Cain's son, which meant that he had actually been sleeping with his stepmother.\n\nThe scenes of Moira entangling herself in the weeds underwater lasted around 15 minutes on-screen, and she did not come up to the surface for air until the first ad break.\n\nClose call: Moira was trapped underwater by some weeds after accidentally being knocked into the water, after her affair with farmhand Nate Robinson was exposed\n\nScary: In an episode fraught with drama, Nate dropped the bombshell that he was Cain Dingle's son, meaning he had actually been sleeping with his stepmother\n\nMade it out: Cain rescued Moira and gave her mouth-to-mouth, but viewers were still bewildered that she survived being underwater for so long\n\nLuckily Moira was eventually rescued by Cain who gave her mouth-to-mouth, but viewers were still bewildered that Moira could have survived the ordeal.\n\nOne tweeted: 'So Nate's spluttering like mad after being knocked into the water and Moira was underwater for 15 minutes and isn't even coughing?'\n\nAnother added: 'How's Moira still alive, she's been underwater since this time last night,' while a third posted: 'How is Moira still alive? She's been trapped under the water for 24 hours.'\n\nShe made it! Eventually Moira made it to the surface, but several viewers pointed out that she had been underwater for around 15 minutes on-screen\n\nOdd: Several viewers took to social media to point out the lengthy time, questioning the unlikelihood that someone would survive underwater for so long\n\nOne fan also posted: 'For somebody who virtually drowned five minutes ago, Moira is pretty alert and energetic.'\n\nAnother added: 'Oh and how did Moira stay underwater for that long? She was unconscious at one point, her body would surely have tried to breathe? No f*****g way she'd survive that long.'\n\nA third also tweeted: 'Most far-fetched episode of #Emmerdale I think I've ever watched! How Moira survived being trapped underwater all that time I'll never know! Disappointed after last night's episode!'\n\nThey made it! After the boat exploded Cain also rescued Nate, and it remains to be seen how they will move forward after the dramatic bombshell\n\nStrange: More viewers then took to Twitter to question the impossible scenes, with one simple branding the show 'far-fetched'\n\nWhat next? Cain quickly abandoned Moira and Nate by the lake after rescuing them and it remains to be seen whether his marriage will recover from the infidelity\n\nDespite the anti-climax of Moira surviving her ordeal, the episode still ended on a dark cliffhanger, as Cain abandoned her and Nate after learning about his true identity.\n\nNate revealed that he was Cain's son and had been abandoned years earlier, and went onto imply that his affair with Moira was nothing more than part of his elaborate revenge plot.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Cain will cope with the news that he has a son, especially given the fact that he appeared to be seconds away from killing him before the bombshell.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Thursday at 7pm and 8pm on ITV.", "description": "Taking to Twitter viewers quickly noted the on-screen blunder after Moira was accidentally knocked into the water, as husband Cain discovered her steamy affair with farmhand Nate Robinson.", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/09/20122554-0-image-a-62_1571907192749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
