He called Warren\u2019s refusal to say whether Medicare-for-all would raise taxes on the middle class \u201cevasive.\u201d He was asked about that in the debate, just after Warren declined to answer the question several times.\n\nIt was an easy tee-up for him to go after the current leader in some polls. \u201cWe heard it tonight, a yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer,\u201d he said, turning toward Warren on the stage. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\"\n\nAD\n\nLater, on foreign policy, Gabbard was explaining why she believes that Americans should get out of Syria.\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg, a fellow veteran, was asked to respond. His answer was arguably one of his strongest of any debate and was memorable for its passion: \u201cWhen I was deployed, not just the Afghan National Army forces, but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces. I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next. This president has betrayed American values. Our credibility has been tattered.\u201d\n\nFinally, Buttigieg and O\u2019Rourke have spent the past few days arguing through media interviews about whether O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons is too radical for the political moment.\n\nAD\n\nThey got the chance to go at it in person Tuesday, when the moderators asked Buttigieg to renew his attacks on O\u2019Rourke. He did.\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg: \u201cCongressman, you just made it clear that you don\u2019t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke argued that congressional leaders can expand background checks as well as try to buy back assault weapons. He accused Buttigieg of being \u201climited by the polls and the consultants and focus groups.\u201d\n\nThat got Buttigieg quite riled up. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal. Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nO\u2019Rourke accused Buttigieg of mischaracterizing his motives and making light of the gun debate by calling O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal a \u201cshiny object.\u201d \u201cThat was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe must buy them back.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg replied: \u201cOn guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban. That would be huge. And we\u2019re going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether it\u2019s, \u2018Hell yes, we are going to take yours guns?\u2019\u201d (Side note: In Congress, the gun debate has stalled, and there is little to no bipartisan support for an assault weapons ban.)\n\nThe backstory\n\nButtigieg is one of the best fundraisers in the Democratic primary, but he\u2019s struggling to poll in the top tier. So it\u2019s no coincidence that at this debate, he tried to stand out.\n\nAD\n\nGoing after Warren is a no-brainer \u2014 most candidates tried to pick a fight with her at some point. But Buttigieg demonstrated a willingness to argue with almost anyone.\n\nHis new attempt at a fiery persona comes as former vice president Joe Biden dips a bit in the polls. Buttigieg has long sided with Biden\u2019s more moderate views on health care and economics, and his campaign is almost certainly calculating that if Biden gets out of the race, Buttigieg could attract some of his supporters.\n\nAD\n\nTuesday\u2019s debate could be an attempt to show those voters that he can handle such a status if the opportunity arises. \u201cHe\u2019s showing tonight that he is ready \u2014 that he can take or throw a punch when needed,\u201d a Buttigieg campaign official wrote in an email, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe potential downside for Buttigieg is to be determined. He is getting more attention (this article is certainly evidence of that), but does he risk eroding his sensible, not-a-politician, Midwestern persona in the process?\n\nAfter all, one of his opening lines in Tuesday\u2019s debate included this: \u201cI\u2019m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Did the normally sanguine mayor show he can take a punch?
