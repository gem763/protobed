The records confirm anew an open secret of admissions: Colleges and universities track with zealous care the applications of children of donors and potential donors.\n\nProminent schools, including Harvard University and the University of Virginia, in recent years have been forced to acknowledge the practice, following the disclosure of internal records about \u201cwatch lists.\u201d The disclosures have proved awkward for schools that want to expand outreach to students from lower-income and middle-class families whose parents did not go to college and are not in position to donate.\n\n[U-Va.: \u2018Prospect\u2019 of gifts to school appeared to drive recruitment of student-athletes]\n\nUniversities insist that the prospect of donations does not wield undue influence and that admissions officers have the final word on who gets in.\n\nThe USC records made public Tuesday show that the admissions office at the private research university in Los Angeles rejected a fair number of special-handling applications backed by USC athletic officials. The emails in the filing \u201cdemonstrate that no Athletic Department official has the authority to compel admissions decisions,\u201d USC said in a statement.\n\nThe records were filed in U.S. District Court in Boston by attorneys for Robert Zangrillo, a Miami businessman who has pleaded not guilty to fraud conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy. He is one of 34 parents charged in the sprawling \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d scandal, which centers on a scheme orchestrated by admitted mastermind William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, a California admissions consultant. He helped children of clients obtain fraudulent SAT and ACT scores and use fake athletic credentials in applications to selective universities.\n\nProsecutors allege that Zangrillo conspired with Singer to help one of his daughters transfer to USC as a purported recruit for the rowing team. According to an indictment, Zangrillo paid $250,000 in the alleged scheme, which included a $50,000 check to \u201cUSC Women\u2019s Athletics\u201d in September 2018 \u2014 after USC admitted her.\n\nIn the court filing Tuesday, Zangrillo\u2019s attorneys argued their client had done nothing wrong or even all that unusual.\n\n\u201cThe notion that Robert Zangrillo\u2019s $50,000 check to USC, made after his daughter\u2019s admission, was a \u2018bribe\u2019 is legally wrong \u2014 there was no quid pro quo corrupt agreement between Mr. Zangrillo and USC that brought this relatively ordinary gift to a university into the orbit of the federal criminal law,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cIt was a donation indistinguishable from the vast numbers of other donations by parents of students made to USC and apparently to other universities and colleges nationwide.\u201d\n\nZangrillo\u2019s attorneys obtained the USC records through pretrial discovery and are seeking further documents. USC is fighting that. \u201cMr. Zangrillo\u2019s filing appears to be part of a legal and public relations strategy to divert attention from the criminal fraud for which he has been indicted by a federal grand jury,\u201d the university said. No trial date has been set for Zangrillo.\n\nThe court records depict a relationship between admissions and athletics at USC that is sometimes cozy, sometimes arms-length. In 2014, a senior USC athletic official named Donna Heinel emailed the admission dean, Timothy E. Brunold, to promote an applicant whose family was on the radar of university officials. \u201cAppreciate it \u2026 they came through Athletics due to father endowing our community service position for 5 mil,\u201d Heinel wrote.\n\n[A Trojan horse: USC was the most frequent target in alleged admissions scheme]\n\nHours later, according to the records, Brunold replied: \u201cI have just been directed to admit this student to the spring semester. Someone on my team will put that decision on today and the ball will get rolling for her.\u201d\n\nHeinel, whom USC fired in March, has pleaded not guilty in the Varsity Blues case to conspiracy to commit racketeering. Brunold has not been charged.\n\nAlso in 2014, records show, Heinel emailed Brunold a \u201cVIP list from Athletics\u201d that included notations of \u201clong time donors.\u201d One VIP was so plugged in that the application received special handling, the list said, through \u201cevery code known to man.\u201d Brunold replied: \u201cThank you Donna \u2014 we\u2019ll be sure to track these and handle them with care.\u201d\n\nBut in 2015, Brunold cautioned Heinel there were limits on what he could do. \u201cI don\u2019t have much maneuvering room this year,\u201d he wrote, according to the court records. He told her that the incoming class would be smaller than in previous years and that he was seeking to maintain high SAT scores.\n\nUSC declined to make Brunold or other USC officials available for comment Wednesday. (Frederick J. Ryan Jr., publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, is on the USC Board of Trustees.)\n\n\u201cThe Office of Admission has no role with respect to donations \u2014 it does not track donations; it does not know how much the family of an applicant has donated; and it does not focus on donations in deciding whether to admit an applicant \u2014 including those whose applications have been marked with special interest tags,\u201d the university said last month in a court filing.\n\nNina Marino, an attorney for Heinel, said Wednesday that the documents make clear \u201cthere was an aspect of USC admission that was directly linked to donations.\u201d She added that Heinel \u201cdid not create this system\u201d and \u201cdid nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for disadvantaged students said the documents underscore a reality they have long known: The admissions process is tilted toward children of privilege. Affluent applicants can hire tutors, attend excellent high schools and take summer trips or internships. Sometimes, their parents donate to colleges they want to attend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s honestly not a surprise,\u201d said Steve Stein, chief executive of SCS Noonan Scholars, a nonprofit group based in Los Angeles and Boston that helps talented students from low-income families connect with top colleges, including USC. \u201cThere are lots of systemic barriers and challenges our students face to getting into any of these schools. It\u2019s unfortunate. But it\u2019s something our students have to deal with and overcome.\"", "description": "On an internal spreadsheet marked \u201cspecial interest,\u201d University of Southern California officials catalogued in exhaustive detail the fundraising possibilities associated with certain applicants.", "authors": ["Nick Anderson", "Reporter Covering Higher Education", "National Education Policy", "The Global Education Market"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bdwEhctpXS-rGVnbR6hWn6ANlS8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YSET7WCSDMI6TPNXIT4URTAGAU.jpg"}
