The couple told reporters after returning to Lahore that they were \"fine\".\n\nWilliam and Kate have also highlighted education and the impact of climate change during their stay in Pakistan.\n\nPakistan's government hopes the couple's four-day visit will help boost the country's image as a tourist and business destination, after decades of sectarian violence and political unrest.\n\nOn Friday, a global money-laundering watchdog gave Pakistan until February to improve its counter-terror financing operations in line with an internationally agreed action plan, or face action.\n\n\"In terms of Pakistan's positive international image, the visit has been an unmitigated success,\" said Rifat Hussain, analyst and a former professor at Quaid e Azam university in Islamabad, though he said there had been some complaints from Pakistanis about the huge security operation around the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting Peter Nicholls in Islamabad, additional reporting by Syed Raza Hassan in Karachi, Writing by Alasdair Pal; Editing by Catherine Evans and Timothy Heritage)", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Nicholls"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U8Jq.RVo3BQbta7sM6dWIg--~B/aD0zMTQ7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/reuters.com/3afbe47cda1406e7b159c7c70cc12b7c", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
