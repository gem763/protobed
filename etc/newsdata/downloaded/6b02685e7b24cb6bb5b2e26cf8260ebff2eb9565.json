She is expected to immediately be flown back to Russia.\n\nButina\u2019s lawyer has complained that her case was stained from the start by anti-Russian sentiment in the midst of the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference in the last presidential election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButina was the first Russian national convicted of seeking to influence American policy in the run-up to that election, though her case was not handled by Mueller, but by local federal prosecutors for the District of Columbia.\n\nAt her sentencing in April, Butina said, \u201cthough it was not my intention to harm the American people, I did that by not notifying the Attorney General of my actions. I deeply regret this crime . . . Please accept my apology and allow me to begin again.\u201d\n\nIn plea papers, Butina said she worked under the direction of Alexander Torshin, a former Russian government official, and with an American political operative on a multiyear scheme to establish unofficial lines of communications with Americans who could influence U.S. politics.\n\nAD", "description": "Butina, whose interactions with the NRA drew the notice of the FBI amid an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, was released Friday morning.", "authors": ["Devlin Barrett", "Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Law Enforcement"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/N0O34LEFpUIWa6SQ-U1brYZ5dkU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JFRV67HXGUI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
