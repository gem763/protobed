He has an old-school sense of Boston Irish loyalty, and Trump welcomed UFC events at his casinos long before most of North America opened doors to MMA.\n\n\u201cWhen we first bought the UFC, no venues wanted us,\u201d White told The Boston Globe in an interview released Friday. \u201cHe actually reached out and said, \u201cCome to the Taj (Mahal). We\u2019d love to have you at the Taj.\u2019 So our first two events were at the Taj Mahal. He showed up at the first fight, stayed until the last fight. Couldn\u2019t have been nicer. Cut us a great deal.\n\n\u201d \u2026 Then, for the rest of my career, anything good that ever happened, the president was the first guy to pick up the phone and call me,\u201d White continued. \u201cHe said, \u2018Congratulations, I knew you were going to do this, I knew this thing was going to big, I knew this, I knew that.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut then Trump won the Presidency over Hilary Clinton in a deeply polarizing election, and in its third year, his administration is mired in what seems to be a never-ending string of scandals. The House of Representatives has opened an impeachment inquiry, and a recent Gallup poll found that 52 percent of Americans support his impeachment and removal from office, including 55 percent of self-identified independents.\n\nWhite, for his part, still stands by Trump. But he also said he doesn\u2019t agree with everything the President does or says.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks I\u2019m a Republican, but I\u2019m not a Republican,\u201d White said. \u201cI\u2019m for the best man or woman for the job. I don\u2019t agree with all of his politics, but it doesn\u2019t matter what president is in there, I don\u2019t agree with everything they say.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of me that\u2019s Republican, and there\u2019s a little bit of me that\u2019s Democratic. I believe in taking care of people that don\u2019t have, I believe in taking care of the planet, you know, all that type of stuff.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, White is a member of the small percentage of Americans in the uppermost income brackets who receive the bulk of benefits of the recent changes to the federal tax code under Trump\u2019s watch, so there still remain things that he and the President see eye-to-eye on.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s a conservative side to me, too,\u201d White said. \u201cI believe in less taxes, and so I don\u2019t agree with all his policies, and I definitely don\u2019t agree with all of his tweets and the things that he says. But there\u2019s a lot of people that I\u2019m friends with that I don\u2019t agree with everything they believe in and everything they say. It\u2019s not that perfect, and that black and white. \u2026 He\u2019s been one of the most solid guys that I\u2019ve ever come across.\u201d", "description": "President Trump and Dana White remain close friends who speak often, even three years into his first term.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/dana-white-ufc-244-press-conference.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
