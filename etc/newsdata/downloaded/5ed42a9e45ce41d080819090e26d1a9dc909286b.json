REUTERS/David Gray\n\nInflation fell to 1.5% in the year to end-September from 1.7% previously, Statistics New Zealand said, moving further away from the central bank\u2019s target, but slightly ahead of a 1.4% rise predicted in a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has already cut its cash rate to a record low, targeting a rise in inflation to the 2% midpoint of its 1-3% target band, as well as keeping employment around its maximum sustainable level.\n\nSpeaking shortly after the inflation figures were released, RBNZ Deputy Governor Geoff Bascand suggested in a speech that further interest rate cuts may on the cards.\n\n\u201cLower rates still may be needed to achieve our inflation and maximum sustainable employment objectives,\u201d Bascand said in a speech to an investment conference in Sydney.\n\nThe bank was also undertaking preparatory work on less conventional monetary policy tools in the event that the policy rate is pushed down to its effective lower bound, he said.\n\nThe central bank stunned markets in August by cutting the official cash rate (OCR) by 50 basis points to 1.0% and raising the prospect of negative interest rates, but kept the cash rate steady last month.\n\nANZ Chief economist Sharon Zollner said the RBNZ\u2019s focus will remain on the slowing economy, which will see inflation fall short over the next year.\n\n\u201cTo support the inflation outlook, we\u2019re expecting cuts in November, February, and May, taking the OCR down to 0.25%,\u201d she said in a note.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar NZD=D4 rose 0.25% after the inflation data, but shed its gains after Bascand's comments.\n\nHIGHER RENTS, PRICES\n\nInflation rose 0.7% in the September quarter compared with 0.6% in the previous three-month period. The RBNZ had forecast a 0.5% quarterly and a 1.3% year-on-year rate of inflation.\n\nThe annual increase was driven by higher prices for rents, cigarettes and tobacco, the statistics agency said. The quarterly CPI increase was due to price rises for local authority rates and payments, vegetables, and meat and poultry, it said. Domestic airfares also shot up.\n\nAnnual non-tradable inflation rose sharply from 2.8% to 3.2% \u2013 the highest level since 2009.\n\nKiwibank Chief Economist Jarrod Kerr said the data was above expectations, but the RBNZ needed to do more on the policy front.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s data just reduces the case that the RBNZ needs to put all 50 bps of stimulus through in November as market pricing has recently suggested was a possibility \u2013 albeit a slim one,\u201d Kerr said in a note.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a 93% chance of a 25 basis points rate cut at the RBNZ\u2019s next meeting on Nov. 13.", "description": "New Zealand's central bank signaled more rate cuts, or even unconventional stimulus measures, may be needed to counter global headwinds, as figures on Wednesday showed the country's annual inflation rate slowed in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Praveen Menon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441270102&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E21Y", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
