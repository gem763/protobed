To make matters worse, the waterfall was flowing too fast for them to enter.\n\n\"My heart sank when I realised the volume of water was just too dangerous to make rappelling down possible,\" Mr Whitson told CNN.\n\nWith no phone signal or \"a single soul\" in sight, Mr Whitson concocted a plan. He wrote a note on a bar order slip that his girlfriend, Krystal Ramirez, 34, had brought to keep game scores: \"We are stuck here at the waterfall. Get help please,\" the note read.\n\nMr Whitson put the note in a green water bottle and carved \"help\" into the side. Then he threw the bottle into the water. \"With one lucky toss, it went right over the waterfall,\" he told CNN.\n\nImage copyright Cindi Barbour Image caption Curtis Whitson placed the SOS note in a green drinking bottle, pictured here\n\nThe note was found around a quarter-mile (0.4km) down-river by two hikers, who raised the alarm, Mr Whitson said.\n\nRescue crew found Mr Whitson, his son Curtis and Ms Ramirez at around midnight on 15 June, just hours after hikers found the floating message.\n\n\"They were really out of options if they hadn't gotten the message out that way, it might've been a while,\" Todd Brethour, of the California Highway Patrol, said.\n\nMr Whitson, a glass and door repairman from Morro Bay, California, said he wants to find the hikers who found his message.\n\n\"It blows me away how it all came perfectly together,\" he told the Washington Post. \"What are the odds?\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "\"We are stuck here at the waterfall,\u201d said an SOS note found in a green bottle", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E9E3/production/_108757895_messageinbottle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
