Irv Comp set Green Bay\u2019s single-season record for interceptions with 10 in 1943.\n\nA native of Pendleton, Texas, Dillon moved with his family to Temple where he lived his entire life. After becoming an All-America defensive back and team captain at the University of Texas, Dillon was selected by the Packers in the third round of the 1952 draft.\n\nDillon was an AP All-Pro selection four times and was selected for the Pro Bowl four times, all while playing with a glass eye.\n\nDillon said he first injured his left eye when he was 5 or 6 years old, The New York Times reported.\n\n\u201cMy dad was doing something and I got a piece of metal in my eye,\u201d he said. \u201cThe doctor removed it and it caused a little cataract to grow. They removed that.\u201d\n\nWhen he was 9, he said, \u201canother little boy my age accidentally hit me in the face with a board and broke my glasses and cut the white part of the eye. The eye started deteriorating, and by the time I was 10 years old, it would not dilate and it was hurting my sight. So when I was 10, they decided to take it out.\u201d\n\nHe was named to the Packers\u2019 50th anniversary team in 1969, their all-modern era team in 1976 and their all-century team in 1999.\n\nDillon retired in 1959 after playing just one season for Vince Lombardi. At the time, his 52 interceptions ranked second on the NFL\u2019s all-time list behind Emlen Tunnell.\n\n\u201cHe and Willie Wood were the two best safeties we ever had here,\u201d said Dave Hanner, a Pro Bowl defensive tackle who played alongside both Dillon and Wood, on the Packers\u2019 website . \u201cWhen Lombardi came here, he talked about Bobby being the best defensive back in the league at that time.\u201d\n\nDillon was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1974 but missed out on selection to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter leaving football, Dillon joined Wilsonart, a Texas-based furnishings manufacturer. He spent 36 years with the firm, eventually becoming president and chief executive.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bobby Dillon, the Green Bay Packers' career leader in interceptions who lost his left eye following two childhood accidents, died Aug. 22 in Temple, Texas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": ""}
