I was so tired at the end of that match. If I played a quick singles match and if I had a chance to eat and rest and recover then I'd want to play, but it will depend on the situation. I won't be playing singles and doubles every day of the Davis Cup. Right now I'm not in the right shape to be doing that.'\n\nAndy Murray pictured in action during a game against Belgian Kimmer Coppejans\n\nHe is also aware that the Murray brothers have not replicated their Davis Cup successes in the last three Olympics.\n\n'It's a difficult one because last time when I played the Olympics I just wanted to play everything \u2013 singles, doubles, mixed. Now I don't think I'm going to do that. With Jamie I would love to play, do well, with him in but if he's got a settled partner that he's playing with who is British and he can get in with them it's a tough one.\n\n'We haven't done well when we've played together in the Olympics. Because it comes round every four years both of us are desperate to do really well but we don't play with each other in preparation so we just turn up and hope it clicks. That's not really the right way to prepare for an Olympics.'\n\nMurray's biggest doubles success at the Games came at London 2012 when he partnered Robson to silver in the mixed.\n\nBrilliant as a teenager, she has since become something the forgotten woman of British tennis, her original long-term wrist injury now compounded by hip problems that required a minor operation and have kept her out since April.\n\nMurray attends the media day at the European Open ATP Antwerp tennis tournament\n\nHer social media postings of attending various event openings have not encouraged the thought that she is entirely committed to getting back, but sources close to Robson say she is in the midst of rehab work with further surgery ruled out.\n\nThis is backed up by Murray, who it turns out has been offering himself as a source of encouragement.\n\n'In the last few months I have seen her quite a bit,' he said. ' I have started practising at the NTC (Roehampton's National Tennis Centre) quite a bit more since they resurfaced the courts and I have seen her around and chatted to her. I feel bad for her.\n\n'She had similar surgery to what I had the first time, which I don't think helped particularly much, and trying different treatments to help with the pain, but I was saying to her to get herself back on the court and see if maybe we could have another go at the Olympics next year. Whether or not that happens I don't know.\n\n'The operation I had, the resurfacing, women can't have it. They can have full replacements but the hip resurfacing is not an option for women because it's something to do with a higher risk of dislocation. Hopefully she can get it sorted, but it's been rough for her.'", "description": "MIKE DICKSON IN ANTWERP: Andy Murray has admitted that his expected dream team partnership with brother Jamie may not materialise in the forthcoming glut of team competitions.", "authors": ["Mike Dickson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19801600-0-image-a-6_1571257845523.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
