What started with a Trea Turner single and finished with the Zimmerman homer illustrated what drove their offense all season.\n\nThe Nationals thrived on contact. They walked lots and struck out little. They sacrificed and bunted and came to represent much of what\u2019s uncommon in the analytics age. The approach embodied Manager Dave Martinez\u2019s aggressive philosophy, and it\u2019s a sizable reason they\u2019re now tied in this National League Division Series despite being out-homered 8-2.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo play chess a little bit and get your pieces set up in order to strike \u2026\u201d Eaton said of the fifth inning, grinning as he trailed off. \u201cIt's the beauty of baseball. It's the little things; walks here, bunts here.\u201d\n\nRyan Zimmerman blasts Nationals past Dodgers, 6-1, to force Game 5 in L.A.\n\nThe bullpen door swung open in the fifth. The Dodgers summoned left-hander Julio Ur\u00edas to maintain a 1-1 tie. Ur\u00edas had baffled the Nationals in Games 2 and 3, yielding just one hit in three innings, but the hitters believed they had a chance to finally break through. They were seeing the 23-year-old for the third time in four days.\n\nUr\u00edas attacked the leadoff hitter, Trea Turner, up and away, just as he had in Game 3. The Nationals shortstop worked a 3-1 count and expected a change-up in the zone, because Ur\u00edas had thrown him one several times before regardless of the situation. But Ur\u00edas surprised him. The left-hander threw a fifth straight fastball, and this one wasn\u2019t headed for the same spot. It ran inside, belt-high and middle-in. Turner smacked it into left field.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHe tried going away again and missed.\u201d\n\nEaton knew he needed a safe bunt this time. He\u2019d tried to push-bunt in Game 1, to effectively slap the ball over the head of Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner, but it resulted in a soft pop-up. Eaton decided to be aggressive and square early, because he wanted time to adjust if Ur\u00edas threw his slider or curveball. Eaton put his face directly behind the barrel so he could watch the spin and resolved that, if he screwed up and fouled the ball off, \u201cit better hit me in the face.\u201d\n\nHe guessed right. Ur\u00edas threw a high, 82-mph slider and though it was \u201cawkward,\u201d Eaton rolled the ball down the third base line. Justin Turner threw to first as Trea Turner scooted into second.\n\nAD\n\nAnthony Rendon didn\u2019t go to the plate looking for a specific pitch or location. He prepared for the fastball, because it\u2019s easier to slow down than catch up. He realized on the first pitch, a curveball in the dirt, he was recognizing Ur\u00edas\u2019s pitches better out of his hand than he had in previous at-bats, perhaps because of familiarity. The second pitch, a 96-mph fastball, ran inside and belt-high to almost the same spot Ur\u00edas missed with against Turner. Rendon slapped it into left field and Turner sprinted home from the second to give the Nationals a lead they never relinquished.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cKeep the line moving,\u201d Rendon said, smiling.\n\nUr\u00edas fell behind Juan Soto 2-0, but the Nationals\u2019 young outfielder missed a slider up in the zone, practically where Eaton had bunted, and popped out to third base. Soto tossed his bat in frustration. He hadn\u2019t moved anyone.\n\nAD\n\nHowie Kendrick wanted to see if Ur\u00edas could regain his command, so he watched a curveball sail over the heart of the plate for strike one. The young left-hander threw to first twice, seemingly to get his timing as much as check on Rendon, who wasn\u2019t a base-stealing threat. Kendrick watched a fastball miss upstairs and then, when Ur\u00edas missed his spot on the next pitch, pounced. The fastball ran inside, about belt-high but this time off the plate. Kendrick stayed through the ball and knocked it into center field while Rendon scampered to third.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMine was a good pitch by him actually,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cI was just able to get enough of the barrel there.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged, adding, \u201cSometimes that happens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMax Scherzer is Max Scherzer again, and the Nationals\u2019 season lives because of it\n\nThe bullpen door opened again. Pedro Baez trotted in as Ur\u00edas walked to the Dodgers dugout. Ur\u00edas went down to the clubhouse to watch video and later lamented that, though he felt 100 percent, his stuff didn\u2019t look like it.\n\n\u201cI missed a lot of pitches,\u201d he said through a team translator. \u201cAnd I paid the price.\"\n\nThe young left-hander watched from the dugout as Baez\u2019s second pitch, a 96-mph fastball, missed the zone but not Zimmerman\u2019s bat. The original National crushed a moonshot to center field. Nationals Park stood and roared as it watched the ball fly out, a glimpse of the franchise\u2019s past and what it hopes for the future. Zimmerman rounded the bases and, when he stepped on home plate, slapped five with Rendon and Kendrick.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis home run will be remembered, and who was on base quickly forgotten. But what made this home run important on the scoreboard, what gave the Nationals the lead and critical insurance runs, were the four at-bats before.\n\nStaff writer Isabelle Khurshudyan contributed reporting to this story.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Dodgers hoped to avoid a Game 5 in L.A., but they\u2019re familiar with the pressure\n\nAlex Ovechkin throwing the first pitch before Game 4 deepens the Capitals-Nationals connection\n\nThe Braves may have overplayed their hand vs. the Cardinals.
