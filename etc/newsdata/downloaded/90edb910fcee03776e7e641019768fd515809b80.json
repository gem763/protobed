It's $24 for the day. And that's less than it was in 2015 when the MUHC reduced rates due to complaints.\n\nIn the east end, it's $17 per day at the Maisonneuve-Rosemont hospital.\n\nThe Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec vowed to cap hospital parking rates during last year's election campaign. However, it is not clear when this new cap will be put into place.\n\n\"We are reviewing everything right now,\" said McCann.\n\nCompensating hospital foundations\n\nThere are concerns the reduction in parking rates could hurt hospital foundations, which rely on the revenue to buy medical equipment and other items.\n\nMcCann said the government is working on a budget that would be used to compensate the foundations. She says that could cost up to $150 million a year.\n\nThe Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec vowed to cap hospital parking rates during last year's election campaign.

(Sylvain Roy Roussel/Radio-Canada)\n\nThe province's finance minister is still crunching the numbers and should be making a formal announcement soon, she said.\n\nMcCann said the government is also looking at ways to ensure that visitor parking is restricted to those visiting the hospital, and not those who work in the area or want to shop nearby.\n\nMcCann has already put a freeze on parking rates across the province and parking is now free at some long-term care facilities, known in French as CHSLDs, said Marguerite Blais, minister responsible for seniors.\n\nParking rates are under review for CHSLDs as well, she said.\n\nCHSLDs should be free, Fortin says\n\nAndr\u00e9 Fortin, the Liberal Party's health critic, said parking at all CHSLDs should be free.\n\n\"Since this is a real living environment, it must be inviting for those who wish to visit their loved ones,\" he said.\n\nWhen in opposition, the CAQ had heavily criticized the Liberals for inaction on the issue. Today, Fortin said Liberals were already working to reduce hospital parking rates and had made it a campaign promise as well.\n\nNow that the CAQ government has been handed the tools to do the job, Fortin said \"we sincerely hope that this measure will take effect as soon as possible.\"\n\nIt's crucial, he said, that patients and people who visit loved ones don't have to pay large sums of money with each trip to the hospital.", "description": "Though it might cost about $150 million a year, Quebec's health minister says there will soon by a provincewide cap on hospital parking.
