And in addition to qualifying for this week\u2019s Democratic presidential primary debate, he has finally qualified for an endorsement from his girlfriend.\n\nBut it took some clarification! In a new Variety interview that touched on her relationship with Booker, Dawson (who stumped for Bernie Sanders in 2016) discussed what she sees as a double standard surrounding the female partners of politicians, who are unfairly scrutinized for their participation, or lack thereof, in campaigns: \u201cHe\u2019s hoping to make the Zombieland premiere,\u201d she said about her boo, \u201cbut I\u2019m curious to see, if he doesn\u2019t, if he\u2019s going to get the same amount of press being like \u2018Why aren\u2019t you supporting your woman?\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019ve been getting all this press like \u2018Why aren\u2019t you at your man\u2019s side?\u2019 when I\u2019ve made it really clear that it\u2019s okay to be a working mom.\u201d\n\nThen she went on to actually decline to endorse Booker, or any other candidate, to emphasize her point. \u201cRegardless of Cory, I wasn\u2019t going to be behind any particular candidate this election,\u201d she said. \u201cI really just want to be behind the electorate.\u201d A wonderful reminder to the men of the world that, even if you run for the highest office in the land, the women in your life don\u2019t owe you an-y-thing.\n\nI regret to inform you that, later, Dawson did sign on to Twitter to clarify her position and endorse bae. \u201cFor the record I, of course, endorse @CoryBooker,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnyone writing otherwise clearly hasn\u2019t been paying attention.\u201d Which makes me wonder whether someone sent her a text that went something like, \u201cHoney? Can u actually endorse me pls?\u201d", "description": "After Rosario Dawson declined to endorse her boyfriend, Cory Booker, in an interview (or any other Democratic presidential candidate), she clarified that she does, in fact, endorse him.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/09/9-cory-booker-rosario-dawson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
