It would send out a strong signal. It is not right to be discriminated against for the colour of our skin. It\u2019s 2019. It\u2019s not tolerable, it\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d\n\nAndrea Dell\u2019 Aquila, a Roma fan, sent Jesus a direct message on Instagram, saying, \u201cYou belong in a zoo, damn monkey, ******.\u201d The club reacted immediately by banning the abuser for life and calling on Italian authorities to clamp down on racist behaviour. Roma made their point on social media, tweeting the league\u2019s official account with the message, \u201cAre you really serious about tackling racism in Italian football @SerieA?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJesus endorsed the England players\u2019 stance. \u201cI have considered walking off myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there were any racist chants from the stand I would not hesitate.\u201d\n\nBulgaria is the potential flashpoint game for England. Southgate\u2019s team will play in Sofia on Monday in a partially-closed stadium after Bulgarian supporters were found guilty by Uefa of racist behaviour during matches against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June. The closure of 5,000 seems to be little deterrent, however.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Racism in football Show all 16 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

The Bulgarian Football Union were fined \u00a334,000 in 2011 after monkey chants were aimed at Ashley Young during England\u2019s 3-0 win at the Vasil Levski Stadium.\n\nJesus called on football\u2019s ruling bodies to follow Roma\u2019s lead and clamp down hard on any transgressors. \u201cRoma sent out a very strong signal by banning the fan that sent me the racial abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cThey set an example for the Italian league. Hopefully the football authorities will build on that.\u201d\n\nYesterday, the Italian football federation fined Atalanta \u00a39,000 because their supporters singled out Dalbert, the Fiorentina defender, for racial abuse last month. The game was stopped for three minutes and a warning was broadcast in the stadium. The same disciplinary body fined Roma about \u00a313,500 after one of their staff applauded sarcastically in a referee\u2019s face.\n\nJesus is disappointed with Atalanta's meagre punishment for the chanting. \u201cIt\u2019s too little a fine for such awful behaviour,\u201d the 28-year-old said. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable and ironic that Atalanta fans are booing a black player when they\u2019ve got black players in their team. They are discriminating against their own players.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident involving Jesus, the player\u2019s abuser attempted to claim that he was the victim and his privacy had been compromised. La Repubblica newspaper published an interview with Dell\u2019 Aquila where he suggested opinions like his were commonplace and warned that his public shaming could incite violence. He asked, \u201cWhat if I go home now and find 10 black boys waiting for me? Did Juan Jesus think of that?\u201d The question went unchallenged by the reporter.\n\nJesus is appalled. \u201cThe article gave a voice to someone who does not deserve to speak out on the subject,\u201d the player said. \u201cHe did not deserve to have space in the newspaper.\u201d\n\nContrary to Dell\u2019 Aquila\u2019s assertion, Jesus said public reactions have been overwhelmingly positive. \u201cI received lots of nice messages from fans and want to thank them,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been in the country for seven years now and it\u2019s nice to see that racists are in the minority.\u201d\n\nDuring his time in Italy awareness of racism has grown, Jesus said, as have attempts to eradicate bigotry. He also praised the actions of Premier League clubs. \u201cA growing number of people are realising about this phenomena,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more needs to be done.\n\n\u201cChelsea set a good example when they banned the fan that booed Raheem Sterling. Things need to be changed and we need to look at gender and religious discrimination, too. There\u2019s no place for discrimination in football.\u201d", "description": "Juan Jesus, the AS Roma defender who was the victim of racist abuse last month, has thrown his support behind the England\u00a0team after Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad pledged to walk off the pitch in the event of bigoted chanting during the upcoming matches against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.", "authors": ["Tony Evans"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/10/shutterstock-editorial-10371934eo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
