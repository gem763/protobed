Unfortunately, not even Android 10 includes an easy way to do this, and you\u2019re forced to manually change themes from the system settings or in each app unless you seek outside help.\n\nIdeally, Android would have a built-in scheduler that swaps between light and dark modes automatically at set times, but there happens to be a third-party app called Automatic Dark Theme that does this very thing. Setting up this app is a bit more complicated than usual, but it\u2019s absolutely worth trying.\n\nInstall Automatic Dark Theme from Google Play. Put your phone into developer mode by going to Settings > About Phone, and tapping \u201cBuild Number\u201d seven times until you see a pop up confirming you\u2019ve enabled developer mode. Next, go to Setting > System > Developer options. Scroll down and turn on \u201cUSB Debugging.\u201d On your PC, install ADB using this 15-second installer package from the XDA forums. Plug your phone into your PC via the USB charger. Open Command Prompt on your PC by pressing \u201cWindows+R\u201d then typing \u201ccmd.\u201d In the command prompt window, type: adb shell pm grant com.cannic.apps.automaticdarktheme android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS Press \u201cEnter\u201d to run the command. After the changes have been applied, you can close Command Prompt and disconnect your phone from your PC. You should also then be able to turn off USB Debugging (for extra safety).\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse\n\nWith the app installed, here\u2019s how to set a timer in Automatic Dark Theme:\n\nOpen the Automatic Dark Theme app. Tap the slider next to \u201cEnable\u201d to turn on the timer. Tap \u201cEnable dark theme at\u201d or \u201cEnable light theme at\u201d to adjust the times each theme will be applied.\n\nYou can also change whether the app applies the change at the exact specified moment, or only while the screen is locked. Switching while the phone screen is locked is the preferred option. Otherwise, any open apps or menus will have to be re-loaded when the theme is changed, which can cause visual bugs or performance issues.", "description": "I enable dark themes on any OS, app, or website that lets me, and upgrading to Android 10 means I can now set dark themes as the default look for all supported apps and menus at the system level....", "authors": ["Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/phyzgrgrtdu0ssm2joab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
