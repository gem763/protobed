Sometimes you have just got to suck that up and wear it, that\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had great support here and at home. I feel that weight, should have delivered for them.\u201d\n\nAustralia made the better start but were unable to turn early possession into points until flyhalf Christian Lealiifano opened the scoring with a penalty after 11 minutes.\n\nThe lead would only last seven minutes before the first of May\u2019s double strike, England giving the Wallabies a lesson in how to make pressure pay when the winger went over on the overlap after a beautifully delayed pass from flanker Tom Curry.\n\nAustralia went straight back on the attack but a David Pocock pop-pass went through the hands of Lealiifano and Henry Slade swooped onto the ball, the centre racing 40 metres before putting May into the left corner again with a neat grubber kick.\n\nThe Wallabies were stunned but still avoiding kicking out of defence, making good ground with ball in hand and again working their way deep into England territory only to spill the ball in the tackle.\n\nEIGHT-POINT LEAD\n\nThe referee was playing advantage, however, so Lealiifano was able to cut the deficit to 14-6 from the kicking tee, with another penalty apiece before halftime sending England into the break with an eight-point advantage.\n\nThree minutes into the second half and it was one point, a lofted pass from Reece Hodge setting centre Jordan Petaia free on the left, the teenager finding Marika Koroibete who turned May inside and out before touching down.\n\nAnother England double whammy almost immediately put the Australians on the back foot again, however.\n\nFarrell first provided a sublime flat pass to put prop Kyle Sinckler in for his first test try and then, after his pack had monstered Australia at the scrum, the flyhalf stepped up to extend the lead to 27-16.\n\nAustralia knew they needed to score next but, when offered the opportunity with a penalty in front of the posts just before the hour mark, Michael Hooper elected to go for a scrum.\n\nEngland\u2019s eight held firm, the defence held firm, and soon they were back in the Australia half hammering away at the try line and earning a penalty that Farrell slotted to take the lead to 14 points.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nThe 2003 champions were now in full control and Farrell slotted a fourth penalty after the Australia forwards collapsed a rolling maul out of desperation.\n\nThe Wallabies were forced to throw caution to the wind and Anthony Watson scored a fourth try from an intercept four minutes to ensure England would match their record winning margin against Australia, the 30-6 win in 2017.", "description": "Winger Jonny May scored two tries in three first-half minutes as England underlined their World Cup credentials with a dominant 40-16 win over Australia on Saturday to set up a semi-final against reigning champions New Zealand.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442614239&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I06E", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
