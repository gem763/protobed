Soon after, doctors at C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital in Ann Arbor declared Reyes brain-dead; since then, relatives have been trying to find a new hospital to care for him.\n\nA court order weeks ago stopped the hospital from ending Reyes\u2019 life support. However, at a court hearing on Tuesday, the judge dismissed the case filed by Reyes\u2019 family to continue that support because the family\u2019s lawyer had filed the case in the wrong court system. The case should have been filed in the court of claims, but instead it was filed in circuit court.\n\nThe judge further said that as a result, he could not grant them a 48-hour stay to refile in the correct court.\n\nARIZONA TEEN IN ICU WITH VAPE ILLNESS, MOM FEELS LIKE 'TOTAL FAILURE'\n\n\"This is life-or-death right now. So we are going to file something; I have something prepared already and we're going to file it, I don't know if it's going to be successful or not. This could be the end. I hope and pray not, but we're going to file something quickly, get it filed within the hour and hope that the court of claims will give us a chance,\" family attorney William Amadeo said after the case was thrown out, according to Fox 2 Detroit.\n\n\"I never thought I'd be fighting to keep my son alive; I thought I'd be waiting for him to get better, not protecting him constantly,\" said Reyes\u2019 mother.\n\nMott conducted a second brain examination on Tuesday and found \u201cno electrical activity and no blood flow to Bobby\u2019s brain.\u201d Legally, doctors were able to discontinue life support, and they did so, as Reyes was surrounded by his family.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA POLICE WARN OF HALLOWEEN CANDY LACE WITH THC\n\n\u201cContinuing medical interventions was inappropriate after Bobby had suffered brain death and violates the professional integrity of Michigan Medicine\u2019s clinicians,\u201d Michigan Medicine spokesperson Mary Masson said. That conclusion wasn't satisfactory to Reyes\u2019 mother, Sarah Jones.\n\nAmadeo said Tuesday that second opinions from other doctors said Reyes was not brain-dead.\n\nMasson said the caregivers at Mott Children\u2019s Hospital had tried to transfer Reyes to another facility, but after contacting 20 different hospitals, none proved willing to take on Reyes\u2019 care.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Despite impassioned objections from the boy\u2019s family, 14-year-old Bobby Reyes was declared brain dead and removed from life support at a Michigan hospital Tuesday.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/bobby-reyes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
