He said \u2018this is one of these Hollywood movies (which) has a cheesy love story and uses our soldiers, to tell it\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018well, not really\u2019 ... I said, my movie is about Dick Best and ... from that moment, he was so supportive .. and he ended up even being an extra.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Director Roland Emmerich arrives at the premiere of his film Independence Day: Resurgence in Hollywood, California U.S., June 20, 2016. REUTERS/Danny Moloshok/File Photo\n\nA special screening of \u201cMidway\u201d was held in Hawaii for U.S. navy members at the base.\n\nDespite the long wait, Emmerich said the upcoming release of the film, which also stars Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid and Nick Jonas, was timely.\n\n\u201cIn the last three, four, five years, because of the whole refugee crisis, nationalism is on the rise again, and right wing parties are on the rise again and it\u2019s great to remind people that at one point nationalism led to World War Two,\u201d he said.", "description": "Twenty years after first toying with the idea, German film director Roland Emmerich brings his World War Two drama \"Midway\" to cinemas next month, focusing on the 1942 Battle of Midway.", "authors": ["Tanya Lezaic", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446212960&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S192", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
