The utility of money becomes more ephemeral.\u201d\n\nOf course, linking the system with Prime also means that Amazon will gain access to another stream of biometric data on scores of U.S. consumers.\n\nThat\u2019s something that should be more than a little concerning, given that the company already provides creepy facial recognition software, Rekognition, to law enforcement with little oversight; it also reportedly pitched U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on using that system to target and identify immigrants, as well as lobbied against laws prohibiting indiscriminate employer collection of biometrics.\n\nIt\u2019s also had what could be charitably described as a subpar record on privacy regarding its Alexa voice assistant, which is arguably surveillance tech packaged as convenience.\n\nTechnology ethics researcher Stephanie Hare told the Post she suspected Amazon made the decision to go with hands over faces because \u201cIt feels less like a mug shot.\u201d But for all intents and purposes, it is a mug shot, just not one that uses a face.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on rumours or speculation,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson told the Post.\n\n[New York Post]", "description": "Amazon is \u201cquietly testing scanners that can identify an individual human hand as a way to ring up a store purchase\u201d with the aim of rolling it out at retail locations, specifically its subsidiary Whole Foods, per a Wednesday report in the New York Post....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "James Whitbrook", "Gordon Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/uvapebzrxbhmosnpgv00.jpg"}
