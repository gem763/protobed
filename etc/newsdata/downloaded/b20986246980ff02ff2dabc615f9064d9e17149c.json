If handed over, the records could provide keys to understanding what transpired between the two countries.\n\nThe request for records from a sitting vice president is unusual in its own right, and Mr. Pence\u2019s office quickly signaled he would not comply. In a letter to Mr. Pence, the chairmen of three House committees wrote that they were interested in \u201cany role you may have played\u201d in conveying Mr. Trump\u2019s views to Ukraine. The lawmakers \u2014 Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman; Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the Foreign Affairs Committee chairman; and Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the Oversight and Reform Committee chairman y asked for a lengthy list of documents detailing the administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, to be produced by Oct. 15.", "description": "House Democrats sent a subpoena to the White House requesting a vast range of documents about President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and efforts to cover up his actions.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/us/politics/04dc-impeach-trump/merlin_162115500_f1f0c1e1-21a1-4b50-affc-a3fc378c44aa-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
