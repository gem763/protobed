Would you call me \u2018the Grouch\u2019?\u201d says David Harbour, his face painted green and his body wrapped in a mink coat.\n\nIt\u2019s the crowning line of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d best sketch from this weekend, a prerecorded fake trailer that imagines Todd Phillips\u2019s \u201cJoker\u201d if it were about the lovable childhood characters from \u201cSesame Street.\u201d Only in this world, there\u2019s nothing lovable about them.\n\n\u201cFrom the studio that brought you \u2018Joker,\u2019 and the twisted minds at Sesame Workshop, comes the next gritty antihero origin story,\u201d a voice-over explains. \u201cFrom director Todd Phillips and the writer of \u2018P is for Potty.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe once-friendly neighborhood of Sesame Street has now become a haven of crime and corruption,\u201d says a newscaster named Guy Smiley for ABCDEFG News.\n\nAll your favorite characters are here, though not the way you remember them. Snuffleupagus is now an angry pimp (with a long furry tie in place of that nose). Ernie gets murdered in cold blood after he and Bert refuse to give up their rubber ducky. Big Bird is a stripper, while the Count spends his time shaking and counting the pills he\u2019s addicted to. Cookie Monster remains a cookie addict, but now he\u2019s also homeless. Elmo gets arrested while shouting \u201cElmo innocent! Elmo didn\u2019t sell no crack! You only arrest Elmo 'cause Elmo Mexican.\"\n\nWhat makes the fake trailer work so well is how closely it adheres to the actual \u201cJoker\u201d trailer, from Harbour\u2019s Grouch explaining how the neighborhood is now filled with \u201chookers and pimps on every corner\u201d (which makes him feel \u201cgrouchy\u201d), to the scenes shot on location around New York City, to an honestly bone-chilling orchestral version of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d theme song playing in the background.\n\n\u201cIf everyone calls you trash and everyone treats you like trash, why don\u2019t you just become trash,\u201d Harbour explains to his therapist, as we watch him smear green paint over his face before lowering himself into Oscar the Grouch\u2019s iconic trash can. Eventually, he\u2019s living in that can, singing in a slow, tortured voice, \u201cCan you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street\u201d and pointing a revolver at an unnamed person.\n\nHe kicks things off with his new persona by emulating Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s now-infamous dance down some city stairs, before the voice-over helpfully says \u201cBrought to you by the letter R.\u201d\n\nWe only have one question: When does this masterpiece hit theaters?\n\nRead more:\n\nTodd Phillips injects \u2018Joker\u2019 with dark humor.
