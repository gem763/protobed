(Zach Dwyer/The St. Cloud Times via AP)\n\nAsked when exactly he fell in love with the sport, 9-year-old Kade Lovell joked that he \u201ccame out running.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to doubt him.\n\nThe fourth-grader of St. Cloud, Minn., ran his first 1k race at 18 months old, according to his mother. He\u2019s run competitively for about three years and even participated in Junior Olympics cross-country meets with USA Track and Field. So, the 5k run Kade participated in last month wasn\u2019t supposed to be a challenge \u2014 after all, he\u2019s run them \u201cplenty of times\u201d before.\n\nBut the outcome of the Sept. 21 Francis Franny Flyer 5k in Sartell came as a shock to Kade and his family, and has since garnered national attention.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never run this long, even in practice,\u201d said his mother, Heather Lovell. \u201cThis helps boost his motivation even more.\"\n\nHeather Lovell grew mildly concerned as she watched other participants in the 5k turn on to its last leg \u2014 Kade is usually a top finisher, so she assumed he was just having a bad race. Her worries intensified, however, when children she knew to be slower than her son entered the home stretch.\n\n[Cardinals beat writer performs CPR in Busch Stadium dugout after videographer collapses]\n\nThe mother flagged down a fireman and other race officials to search for Kade, to no avail. Heather Lovell\u2019s mother even drove the course to see if Kade had fallen or pulled a hamstring.\n\nBut he was nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cI start panicking,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m bawling, my son\u2019s gone. Is he hurt? Is he stolen? What happened?\u201d\n\nThen, salvation: another spectator called a relative who was running in the 10k race, Heather Lovell said. That runner was reportedly blown away by a \u201ccute boy who was doing really well.\u201d\n\nHeather Lovell was initially upset when she realized the young runner in question was her son.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m mad \u2014 what the heck?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would he run the 10k, why wouldn\u2019t he tell me?\u201d\n\n\n\nKade Lovell, 9, smiles with his medal for winning the St. Francis Xavier Franny Flyer 10k on Saturday, Sept. 28, 2019 in Sartell, Minn. Lovell accidentally won the 10k last weekend after only planning on completing the 5k. (Zach Dwyer/The St. Cloud Times via AP)\n\nIt turns out Kade had no idea either. Volunteers had figured he was a willing participant in the 10k, which equates to a 6.2-mile run. It was also organized by the St. Francis Xavier Church and followed a near-identical route. When Kade approached the turn for the 5k, he says a woman instructed him to continue running straight. He obliged.\n\nAfter learning her son was okay, Heather Lovell returned to her previous vantage point to wait for him to finish. Still upset, she concluded he was in dead last for when she saw him running by himself.\n\nThe two reconvened at the finish line. As Kade tearfully explained to his mother that the mix up was an accident, a race coordinator notified them that he had actually come in first place for the 10k.\n\n\u201cI was like \u2018in his age group?\u2019 \u201d Heather Lovell recalled. \u201cShe said, \u2018No, out of all of them. No 10kers have finished yet.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWe were all kind of in shock,\u201d she added.\n\nHer son had finished in just over 48 minutes \u2014 about one minute faster than the 40-year-old woman who came in second, according to Heather Lovell. The coordinator told them the average age of the top 10 finishers was 38.\n\nKade told The Washington Post he was \u201ctired and a little excited\u201d upon learning of his first-place ranking. But his mother recalled a slightly different version of events.\n\n\u201cOnce he found out he had won first he was excited, then he was like \u2018no way!\u2019 \u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cHe had no clue he was in the lead.\u201d\n\nHeather Lovell said her son wants to continue running competitively. Kade said he plans to train for a marathon, eventually.\n\nHe\u2019s off to a blistering start.\n\nRead More:\n\nRaiders\u2019 Vontaze Burfict banned for the rest of the season for helmet-to-helmet hit\n\nSharks are chomping at Nats Park, and I think we\u2019re going to need a bigger bandwagon\n\nOn one of his worst days, Patrick Mahomes shows why he is the NFL\u2019s best", "description": "Kade Lovell finished in just over 48 minutes \u2014 about one minute faster than the 40-year-old woman who came in second, according to Kade\u2019s mother, Heather.", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter", "October At Am", "Michael Brice-Saddler Is A General Assignment Reporter.
