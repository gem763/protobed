It is a problem of men,\" Ramaphosa said.\n\nThis part of the plan entails the following measures:\n\nA mass media campaign that will target communities, public spaces, workplaces, campuses, schools and recreational spaces like taverns. The focus will be on men's groups and formations, youth at risk and offenders inside prisons.\n\nWomen\u2019s rights and gender power relations will be part of Life Orientation in the school curriculum.\n\nGender-sensitivity training for law enforcement officials, prosecutors, magistrates and policymakers. Those who are found in breach of their responsibilities in this regard will be held to account.\n\nTrain and deploy prevention activists to all of 278 municipalities. They will engage in household visits and community interventions focused on changing harmful social norms.\n\nStrengthen the criminal justice system\n\n\"This is to ensure that justice is served, perpetrators are held to account, survivors do not suffer secondary victimisation, and the law acts as a deterrent,\" Ramaphosa said.\n\nIt includes the following measures:\n\nDirecting resources to improve the functioning of sexual offences courts, Thuthuzela care centres, and the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Investigation Units of the SAPS;\n\nFunding has already been approved for the establishment of an additional eleven sexual offences courts over the next financial year; and\n\nThe Department of Justice and Constitutional Development will clear the backlog of criminal cases for rape and other forms of gender-based violence through the establishment of special courts, hiring additional court staff and clearing the backlog at forensic labs.\n\nEnhance the legal and policy framework\n\n\"Since the advent of democracy, we have enacted several laws and undertaken a number of programmes to tackle gender inequality in our society, to promote human rights and to enable effective action against gender-based violence,\" Ramaphosa said.\n\n\"In many respects, however, these measures have fallen short of what is needed to confront the severity of the challenges we face.\"\n\nThe measures to improve the legal and policy framework are:\n\nProposing a range of legal and regulatory reforms to Parliament to strengthen the response of the State to gender-based violence and to ensure that all crimes against women and children attract harsher minimum sentences.\n\nEngaging with the judiciary on the role that it can play in supporting the national effort to end gender-based violence to ensure abusers, rapists and murderers know that they will be caught and punished. The State should oppose bail for suspects charged with the rape and murder of women and children and those who are found guilty of such crimes should not be eligible for parole.\n\nStrengthen programmes to rehabilitate offenders and youth at risk. Finalise legislation like the Victim Support Services Bill, which will strengthen support for GBV programmes and services.\n\nRamaphosa called on all parliamentary committees to prioritise these areas of legislative reform and ensure that we have effective legislation in place without delay.\n\nEnsure adequate care, support and healing for victims of violence\n\nMeasures in this part of the plan are:\n\nStandardising the framework for funding civil society organisations working with survivors of gender-based violence;\n\nProviding post-rape training for healthcare providers and lay counsellors who provide care and support to victims and survivors;\n\nWorking with the private sector, concerned individuals and other institutions to substantially increase the number of Thuthuzela care centres across the country from the current 54 to over 100 by 2025;\n\nMeet with representatives of the private sector to discuss the establishment of a Gender-based Violence and Femicide Fund to increase support to survivors, including persons with disability and the LGBTQI+ community;\n\nAs drug and alcohol abuse fuel gender-based violence, the Department of Social Development has been tasked with increasing the visibility of substance abuse awareness and education and prioritising funding for more treatment facilities; and\n\nResource the gender-based violence framework in universities and colleges, which will include the establishment of gender equity offices in these institutions. Ramaphosa will meet the universities' vice-chancellors to come up with initiatives that are focused on what should be done at institutions of higher learning.\n\nImprove the economic power of women\n\n\"Women are often hostages in abusive relationships because of poverty and unemployment. Young women, in particular, are vulnerable to exploitation from older men with financial resources. By tackling unequal economic power dynamics we can reduce the vulnerability of women to abuse,\" Ramaphosa said.\n\nThis will include the following measures:", "description": "President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced a five-point emergency plan to put a halt to gender-based violence during an extraordinary joint sitting of Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9323/ff6b5b4e5a564c71b4375fff9db3698f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
