You\u2019re there for French rugby and to try to go as far as possible, to see if you can win this World Cup - but we will only get there if you take control,\u201d Boudjellal said.\n\n\u201cJapan is a magnificent country to visit. Our coaches who are there, I invite you to \u2026 treat yourself and leave the players to tell their own stories because for years I\u2019ve not understood the game plan of this France team,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSomething is going wrong, so it\u2019s over to you guys [the players] \u2026 there are guys in this group who will be major coaches in the future \u2026 kick the coaches out, take control, because we are ready to follow you.\u201c\n\nFrench players appeared in almost rebellion against the then coach Marc Li\u00e8vremont during a turbulent 2011 World Cup campaign, one which saw the team reach the final and lose 8\u20137 to the All Blacks. Brunel\u2019s side have beaten Argentina, the United States and Tonga so far and Saturday\u2019s game against unbeaten England will determine who tops the pool heading into the quarter-finals.\n\nThere was no sign of any disquiet against the coaching group during France\u2019s media session on Tuesday but there was plenty of support for Guirado. \u201cThe captain is Guidrado,\u201d L\u2019Equipe reported Gregory Alldritt as saying. Ga\u00ebl Fickou added: \u201cThere is no debate on the captain. Guilhem Guirado is our captain. His influence does not change. He always speaks. But it is not he who dictates strategy for example. But for the rest, it is clear, he is the captain. We are all behind him.\u201d\n\nMaxime M\u00e9dard took a wider view of Guirado\u2019s position as captain among the squad. \u201cFor us, it is Guilhem who is the captain. And when he\u2019s not on the pitch, it\u2019s Jeff [Poirot] or Louis [Picamoles]. There are no discussions in our group around this.\u201d", "description": "France players must \u2018kick the coaches out\u2019 if they are to have any chance of winning the Rugby World Cup, according to the Toulon president, Mourad Boudjellal", "authors": ["Guardian Sport", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/france_Guilhem_Guirado.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4c86ebe74348a3fa9bb14107430fd55", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
