Photo: NOAA Handout/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Dorian, now the second most powerful Atlantic storm ever recorded, smothered and battered the northern Bahamas at Category 5 strength on Sunday, making landfall with sustained wind speeds of 185 mph. It continues its northwest crawl toward the southeast U.S. coast, and still threatens to make landfall on Tuesday.\n\nDorian is currently forecast to \u2014 at best \u2014 graze the east coast of Florida after making a northward turn sometime Monday. Its likely path remains far too close for comfort, however, and some forecast models still project that it will hit Florida, which has been under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm since Wednesday. Meteorologists and authorities have warned that the small but uniquely powerful hurricane remains very dangerous, even if it doesn\u2019t shift west \u2014 let alone what may still happen further up the coast in Georgia and the Carolinas later this week.\n\nBelow is what we know about the storm\u2019s present state, path, and potential impact.\n\nThis hi-res 3D satellite loop of #Dorian continues to blow my mind this evening. Note how the reds are expanding at the end of the loop...a possible indication of an expanding wind field. pic.twitter.com/5279AcKf7O \u2014 Steve Caparotta, Ph.D. (@SteveWAFB) September 2, 2019\n\nWhere is Dorian now \u2014 and how strong?\n\nOn Sunday night, Dorian was still inching its way across the northern Bahamas with record strength.\n\nWhen the storm made landfall just after midday Sunday at Elbow Cay, Abacos, its sustained wind speeds of 185 mph were the second highest ever recorded in the Atlantic (a tie with three other storms) and the highest among Atlantic storms that have made landfall (a tie with devastating 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck the Florida Keys).\n\nHurricane Durian Abaco Video pic.twitter.com/wmzj0UVE4m \u2014 Latrae Rahming (@p0sitivechange) September 1, 2019\n\nAs a result, the Bahamas faced the most powerful storm in its recorded history on Sunday. The northern islands in Dorian\u2019s path experienced \u201ccatastrophic\u201d conditions \u2014 including wind gusts of more than 220 mph, an 18-23 foot storm surge, and as much as 30 inches of torrential rain in some areas.\n\nThe full extent of the damage was not yet clear late Sunday, but footage shared from Abacos earlier in the day showed massive flooding and widespread structural damage to homes \u2014 as well as terrified residents huddled against the storm in their shattered homes. The storm\u2019s western eyewall began crossing the eastern part of Grand Bahama Island around 9 p.m. and the slow-moving storm is forecast to continue to pound the Bahamas well into Monday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center\u2019s probability cone for Dorian as of 8 p.m. Sunday, and it\u2019s important to remember that this illustration does not reflect the size of the storm, only the possible paths it could take.

Though the storm\u2019s most-likely path will keep it offshore, everything depends on what happens once the storm makes its projected northward turn early in the week.\n\nOn Monday, Dorian is predicted to slowly move northwest toward Florida, with tropical storm conditions likely to arrive on the state\u2019s east coast. If the storm shifts west and makes landfall in Florida, which some models indicate it will, that will most likely happen on Tuesday.\n\nOuter rainbands from #HurricaneDorian starting to come onshore in Vero Beach, Florida. The plan is to follow the eye north along the coastline in the H.E.R.V. and be in position just in case it makes landfall and/or document it\u2019s closest approach to the coast.

(At least one horrifying possibility appears to have been ruled out: the Miami Herald noted on Sunday that meteorologists do not believe the storm could make a surprise swing to the southwest like the devastating Hurricane Andrew did at this point in its trajectory in 1992.)\n\nNo matter what, dangerous weather conditions will begin affecting Florida\u2019s east coast sometime on Monday, and state authorities have urged residents to continue to prepare for the worst.\n\nAnd with Georgia and South Carolina both in Dorian\u2019s potential path later in the week, both state\u2019s governors have ordered mandatory evacuations for coastal areas starting Monday.\n\nThis post has been repeatedly updated and revised across the progression of the storm.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian, now one of the most powerful Atlantic storms ever recorded, struck the Bahamas on Sunday at Category 5 strength.
