Now, everyday civilians can buy them.\n\n\"Wellness and health don't need to be portrayed as high end aspirations for the privledged few,\" Justin Guilbert, co-founder of Bravo Sierra, told FOX Business of the company he started with Benjamin Bernet, who has worked with beauty brands like L'Oreal, Kiehl's and Glossier.\n\nBravo Sierra, named for the coded military idiom used to call bulls---t, partnered with the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps to sell the products its service members helped make in base camp exchanges - known as retailers that sell products for military service members.
