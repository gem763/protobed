We didn\u2019t have a well developed approach to broadband.\n\n\"I must say I was sympathetic to their proposal. I thought we were bleeding politically on this. But the then prime minister [John Howard] and treasurer [Peter Costello] reacted badly to it and rejected it out of hand,\" he says.\n\nMinchin's account is that Howard and Costello rejected it because of the cost to government. \"The prime minster felt Telstra could just go and do it themselves.\" On this he differs from Graeme Samuel, then chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\n\nSamuel strongly opposed Telstra's proposal, but not because of the cost to government \u2013 although he doubts Telstra could have achieved what it was proposing for $5 billion. His main objection was that Telstra wanted to charge too much to retailers to access the new broadband network, which would result in unacceptably high prices for consumers.\n\nHe says Howard and Costello's decision to reject Telstra's proposal was influenced by the ACCC's concern for consumer detriment. He says following the government's decision to back the ACCC's stance, Costello rang him up and said, \"Every time you used the word consumer that sent a tingle down my back. We realised that\u2019s what it was all about,\" he recalls.\n\nSamuel paints a picture of Trujillo as a man intent on taking every possible advantage of Telstra's immense market power to maximise returns for Telstra shareholders. If that meant gouging consumers, so be it.\n\nBut Minchin sees it differently. Trujillo, in his view, was doing what a responsible CEO must do: looking after the money shareholders had invested in the company with the expectation of a return. Like McGauchie, he says expecting Telstra to make the investment when it could only extract margin costs from retailers was unrealistic.\n\nEnter Rudd and Conroy\n\nIn 2008, when the recently elected Rudd government went to tender, under the leadership of communications minister Stephen Conroy, for a private organisation to build a national broadband network, the same issue reared its head.\n\nLabor went to the 2007 election with what Minchin says was a version of Telstra's proposal as their official broadband policy. It would have cost a total of $15 billion, of which the government would contribute just under $5 billion. But when they arrived in government, Minchin says \"bureaucrats\" persuaded them to go to tender. He says terms of the tender were \"naive\" about commercial reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTelstra for quite proper and commercial reasons said to the government, 'We\u2019re not in a position to meet your tender requirements because we\u2019d have to disclose very commercially sensitive information.\" He says Telstra acted \"absolutely properly in terms of their shareholders and the requirements of a public corporation\". McGauchie makes the same point: Telstra could not meet the tender requirements if it was to fulfil its duty to shareholders.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Labor sees things very differently. One source who was closely involved in the Rudd government tender process says Telstra's infamous 12-page non-compliant bid was an attempt to \"call our bluff\".\n\nTelstra, according to this narrative, was so sure of its monopolistic power it didn't consider the possibility that the government would go it alone. Trujillo assumed to do so would require the government to cut off Telstra's copper network \u2013 basically an act of expropriation \u2013 which would result in a compensation bill of upwards $20 billion payable to Telstra, the source said. On top of that, building the network would cost a further $25 billion, meaning a government would end up with a $45 billion bill. It was all so wildly expensive surely no government would be reckless enough to actually do it.\n\n\"They never envisaged we would go around them, bypassing their network altogether,\" the source says. That, in the end, is exactly what Labor did.\n\nDeja vu\n\nFast forward 10 years, and NBN Co itself is facing much the same problem as Telstra foresaw in 2008: how to get a return on investment.\n\nOpponents of the NBN like to say that, by the end of the roll-out, it will have cost the taxpayer almost $50 billion, not the original $43 billion estimated by Labor. And, thanks to the Abbott government's radical changes to Labor's plan in 2013, under then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull, it will be a far inferior network to that envisaged by Rudd and Conroy.\n\nBut claiming it is a cost to taxpayer misses a key point. NBN Co intends to recuperate every penny of that $50 billion, and more, from customers. If all goes to plan, shareholders (taxpayers) will come out of the whole thing better off.\n\nNBN Co and the government insist everything is progressing well, that the NBN will pay for itself, and the taxpayer will never have to foot the bill.\n\nBut pretty much everyone else disagrees. You will be hard pressed to find someone in the know who doesn't think a massive write-down is on the horizon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHave a look at the mess they\u2019ve got now,\" says McGauchie. \"A situation that requires a massive write-off because the economics didn\u2019t work. We were never prepared to provide shareholders funds that would have required a massive write-off.\"\n\nThe 'returns problem' returns\n\nTo make the required return on the investment, NBN Co is charging a wholesale price that retailers say is too high. Telstra boss Andy Penn continually complains that as things stand Telstra cannot make a profit out of reselling NBN. As a result, once the land grab of customers under way is over, prices will have to go up, likely to well over $70 a month. NBN Co is also raising private sector hackles by aggressively selling its fibre to business customers \u2013 in violation, the private sector claims, of its strict wholesale-only mandate.\n\nTelecommunications consultant Paul Budde says NBN prices of more than $60 per month will push lower income households out of the market, forcing them to turn to other options such as mobile or fixed wireless. He says these people make up a \"very large proportion of the Australian population\".\n\nTelstra shareholders are absolutely paying for the negative behaviour under Trujillo. \u2014 Paul Budde\n\nSo why is it so difficult to make the NBN pay for itself? To Budde, the answer is simple. The designers of the NBN, he says, took the supremely uncommercial decision to make sure every Australian, regardless of where they live, had access to the NBN for the same price. That means customers in metropolitan areas, where there is a commercial incentive to build fibre, are subsidising customers out in the bush.\n\n\u201cThe NBN was a nation-building activity, not a money-making scheme,\" Budde says. \"The government went wrong by trying to make it a semi-commercial activity. It would be impossible on a commercial basis.\" The NBN, in other words, should have been regarded as an on-budget public good.\n\nBut it didn't have to be that way, according Budde. He doesn't accept Minchin and McGauchie's claim that Trujillo was looking after shareholders. He says Trujillo's replacement, David Thodey, took a totally different, much more conciliatory approach to the government's cause. If he had been chief executive in 2008, he says there is a good chance Telstra would have put in a compliant bid, and everything would have looked different.\n\nSamuel agrees. \"If Catherine Livingstone and David Thodey had been chair and CEO of Telstra at the time the NBN was contemplated, you\u2019d have a totally different situation. Catherine and David were exemplars of proper behaviour of a big corporation that had been gifted the national monopoly,\" he says.\n\nAs it is, Telstra has dramatically lost that monopoly, and is now facing a $3.4 billion a year earnings hole. Already dividends have been slashed in half, and that's before the migration to the NBN is even complete. Budde says Trujillo must bear much of the blame for this. Ironically, the American's bullish attempt to protect his shareholders' interests had the reverse effect. \"Telstra shareholders are absolutely paying for the negative behaviour under Trujillo,\" he says.", "description": "The divisive American was back in the headlines this week as the current and former heads of Telstra battled it out over the NBN.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_77/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/914001d4fbd8441afeec0b206c5384421880c06c", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
