Three years later, I\u2019m even less sure what that means \u2014 and the company\u2019s recent acquisition of a startup that uses neuroscience to make you more addicted to technology doesn\u2019t help in the slightest.\n\nThrive Global\u2019s most public platform is its wellness blog where virtually anyone can post, even if they falsely claim they\u2019re a doctor. But the company also runs workshops and has a \u201cbehaviour change coach\u201d app.\n\nThe company announced on Thursday that it has purchased Boundless Minds, which Thrive describes as a \u201cneuroscience-based artificial intelligence company and leader in behavioural design and engineering.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch called Boundless Minds a \u201ctech company that wants to make you even more addicted to your phone\u201d in a 2017 article that explained the startup pulls from the engagement strategies of Facebook and other social media to hook people on other apps.\n\nTwo months later, Facebook\u2019s first president Sean Parker condemned Facebook\u2019s engagement tactics in an Axios interview, saying it \u201cexploit[s] a vulnerability in human psychology\u201d by giving users \u201ca little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever,\u201d creating a \u201csocial-validation feedback loop.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Boundless Minds was called Dopamine Labs.\n\nIn a Thrive blog post about the recent purchase, Huffington wrote that she first found out about Dopamine Labs when 60 Minutes featured the company on a segment about \u201cbrain hacking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved the fact that they were using the same technology designed to hook people to social media and gaming to instead unhook us, and help drive us to more healthy habits,\u201d Huffington wrote in her blog. \u201cI know it sounds paradoxical, but the truth here is paradoxical. We\u2019ll never be able to change behaviour at scale if we don\u2019t use all of the tools in our toolkit, including the most cutting-edge technology.\u201d\n\nIn the 60 Minutes segment Boundless Minds cofounder and COO Ramsey Brown doesn\u2019t say that they\u2019re using the same technology to \u201cunhook\u201d people from social media, but he does mention his company built an app that creates a 12-second delay before social media apps launch on a phone, that didn\u2019t get accepted into the Apple app store.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch\u2019s post about the acquisition, Boundless Minds\u2019 current technology monitors phone activity, and analyses that information and uses it to create prompts that stimulate behaviour, presumably for the betterment of the user.\n\nHuffington wrote in her blog that Thrive will use this technology for its \u201cbehaviour change platform,\u201d which will help users make good choices that will benefit their health.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from Huffington\u2019s blog or the company press release about the acquisition how it actually plans to accomplish these goals. Neither release provides concrete details.\n\nGizmodo asked Thrive Global for examples of how it plans to use Boundless technology and Thrive chief brand officer Danny Shea was even more opaque. He said that Thrive already has a behaviour change platform that it provides for business customers, which uses \u201cinspiring storytelling to help shift individual behaviour and organizational culture\u201d and Boundless technology will \u201cdramatically accelerate our technology roadmap and [Software as a Service] business.\u201d\n\nShea continued:\n\nBy integrating Boundless \u2014 with its reinforcement system and experiment systems and performance feedback loops \u2014 we will make our platform smarter and stickier. We\u2019ll be able to target the right Microstep to the right user at the right time. We\u2019ll leverage the Boundless team that has joined us at Thrive and their expertise to ensure that our platform drives intrinsic motivation \u2014 that our users get and feel rewards for doing things that are good for them that go beyond the financial incentives and extrinsic motivation that defined the last era of B2B wellness offerings.\n\nMicrostep is a Thrive-ism, which Huffington defines as \u201csmall, actionable, incremental, and science-backed steps we can take to make immediate changes in our daily lives.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Thrive is already working for me. Trying to figure out what any of this means has made me want to disconnect from technology entirely.", "description": "Ariana Huffington left Huffington Post in 2016 to create Thrive Global \u2014 a confounding venture that aims to help people reduce stress and burnout by taking control of their relationship with technology.
