The CRISPR gene editing technique is being used an increasing amount in health research because it can change the building blocks of the body. At a basic level, CRISPR works as a DNA cutting-and-pasting operation. Technically called CRISPR-Cas9, the process involves sending new strands of DNA and enzymes into organisms to edit their genes. In humans, genes act as blueprints for many processes and characteristics in the body \u2013 they dictate everything from the colour of your eyes and hair to whether or not you have cancer. The components of CRISPR-Cas9 \u2013 the DNA sequence and the enzymes needed to implant it \u2013 are often sent into the body on the back of a harmless virus so scientists can control where they go. Cas9 enzymes can then cut strands of DNA, effectively turning off a gene, or remove sections of DNA to be replaced with the CRISPRs, which are new sections sent in to change the gene and have an effect they have been pre-programmed to produce. But the process is controversial because it could be used to change babies in the womb \u2013 initially to treat diseases \u2013 but could lead to a rise in 'designer babies' as doctors offer ways to change embryos' DNA.

We were really excited.'\n\nIt's a long ways from ready to use in correcting DNA mutations in living humans with these devastating diseases, but the researchers are extremely optimistic that their method can correct the mutations driving 89 percent of single disease-causing DNA mutations.\n\n'A major aspiration in the molecular life sciences is the ability to precisely make any change to the genome in any location. We think prime editing brings us closer to that goal,' said Dr Liu.\n\n'We're not aware of another editing technology in mammalian cells that offers this level of versatility and precision with so few byproducts.'", "description": "Scientists at MIT and Harvard University's Broad Institute have developed a new way to change single letters in the genetic code without making risky 'cuts' to strands of DNA that can cause unintended edits.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/20/20002936-0-image-a-17_1571685498531.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
