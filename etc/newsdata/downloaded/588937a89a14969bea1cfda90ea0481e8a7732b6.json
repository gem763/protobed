He was one of four journalists and one news organization recognized as the TIME 2018 Person of the Year for \u201ctaking great risks in pursuit of greater truths.\u201d\n\nA United Nations special report released in June found \u201ccredible evidence\u201d warranting a deeper investigation into the role of bin Salman in Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Free press and human rights advocates have called for a stronger response from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration over the killing.\n\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, bin Salman said he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for Khashoggi\u2019s murder, but denied that he had ordered the killing, calling the death \u201ca mistake\u201d and \u201ca heinous crime.\u201d\n\nOthers on the One Free Press list this month include a freelance photographer who has been detained in Venezuela for a year without trial and a journalist in Azerbaijan who started a hunger strike to protest his prison conditions.\n\nRead about the 10 journalists on the October list here:\n\n1. Jamal Khashoggi (Saudi Arabia): One year without resolution in high-profile, brazen Khashoggi killing\n\nAs of October 2, one year has passed without justice or resolution for the death of Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered inside Istanbul\u2019s Saudi consulate. The U.S. executive branch and UN have not gotten involved, despite a congressional call for investigation and CIA findings pointing blame at Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince.\n\n2. Afgan Mukhtarli (Azerbaijan): Diabetic journalist on hunger strike in Azerbaijan prison\n\nIn September, journalist Afgan Mukhtarli with Type 2 diabetes went on a hunger strike in protest of Azerbaijan prison conditions. His six-year prison sentence began in January 2018, after authorities abducted the reporter in Georgia and charged him with illegally crossing the border and carrying contraband. He had been living in exile in Georgia since 2014 due to death threats in relation to his investigative reporting on corruption.\n\n3. Abduljalil Alsingace (Bahrain): Urgent medical attention needed for Bahrain blogger serving life sentence\n\nJaw Central Prison has continuously denied critical medical treatment (as well as prescriptions, toiletries and hygienic products) for Abduljalil Alsingace, who suffers daily chest pain and was sentenced in June 2011 to life imprisonment for \u201cplotting to topple the monarchy.\u201d One of several high-profile government critics arrested for pro-reform protests, Alsingace had written critically about human rights violations, sectarian discrimination and repression of the political opposition on his blog, Al-Faseela (Sapling).\n\n4. Marzieh Amiri (Iran): Imprisoned Iranian reporter suffers epilepsy and deteriorating health\n\nLast month Iranian authorities allowed Marzieh Amiri a hospital visit to monitor epilepsy, after she had been denied proper medical attention in the months since her arrest for covering May Day demonstrations for Tehran-based newspaper Shargh Daily. Family members were not allowed contact during the medical care and were responsible for the bill. In August, Tehran sentenced Amiri to 10 and a half years in prison and 148 lashes for charges of \u201cassembly and collusion against national security,\u201d \u201cpropaganda against the state\u201d and \u201cdisturbing public order.\u201d\n\n5. Azimjon Askarov (Kyrgyzstan): Kyrgyz journalist\u2019s health worsens after nine years in prison\n\nIn addition to his deteriorating health and limited access to medication, Azimjon Askarov\u2019s letters home from prison have noted punishment for detainees after visiting days. The ethnic Uzbek award-winning journalist has served nine years of a life sentence for reporting on human rights violations. In July, a Kyrgyz court ruled to uphold the term despite persistent international condemnation.\n\nKyrgyz journalist Azimjon Askarov Courtesy of Sherzod Askarov\n\n6. Jes\u00fas Medina (Venezuela): Imminent court date for Venezuelan photographer jailed one year without trial\n\nFreelance photographer Jes\u00fas Medina has an October 3 court appearance, after serving more than a year in the Ramo Verde military prison pre-trial. Venezuela has charged him with criminal association and inciting hate. Medina has faced harassment previously while reporting.\n\n7. Austin Tice (Syria): No answers after seven years in case of U.S. freelancer missing in Syria\n\nSeven years ago, American freelance journalist Austin Tice went missing in Syria. The Georgetown University law student had spent the summer of 2012 reporting on civilian life during the country\u2019s civil war and was detained at an automobile checkpoint. Tice\u2019s family and the U.S. State Department are under the assumption that Tice is still alive despite his unknown whereabouts.\n\nMarc and Debra Tice, the parents of U.S. journalist Austin Tice (portrait L), who was abducted in Syria more than six years ago, give a press conference in the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Dec. 4, 2018.

Mahmoud Hussein Gomaa (Egypt): Nearly three years of imprisonment sans trial for Egyptian Al Jazeera journalist\n\nFor more than 1,000 days, Mahmoud Hussein Gomaa has served pre-trial detention in Cairo\u2019s Tora Prison Complex. The journalist was arrested on December 23, 2016 on anti-state and false news charges, following an Al Jazeera documentary about conscription in Egypt. The jail time has been repeatedly renewed every 45 days, according to the local press freedom group Journalists Against Torture and a social media post from Al Jazeera director Yasser Abu Hilalah.\n\n9. Azory Gwanda (Tanzania): Almost two years of uncertainty regarding Tanzanian journalist\u2019s condition\n\nA freelance journalist investigating mysterious killings in rural Tanzania, Azory Gwanda has been missing since November 21, 2017. The government has failed to conduct a credible investigation or disclose what it knows. On July 10, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Palamagamba Kabudi said in an interview that Gwanda had \u201cdisappeared and died,\u201d but backtracked amid requests for clarification.\n\nAzory Gwanda Courtesy of Mwananchi Publications Limited\n\n10. Hajar Raissouni (Morocco): Personal matters cited as reason for Moroccan reporter\u2019s arrest\n\nMoroccan authorities are employing journalists\u2019 personal information as grounds for arrest, as in the case of Hajar Raissouni, a reporter for independent news website Akhbar al-Youm. She was taken into custody on August 31 while leaving her doctor\u2019s office with her fianc\u00e9, charged with sex outside of marriage and illegal abortion.
