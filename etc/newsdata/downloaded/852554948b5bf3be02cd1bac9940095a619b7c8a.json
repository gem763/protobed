The pair talked, they had lunch. Mr. Savage accompanied Mr. Trump to a fundraiser in California and said he walked away with insight about the president and an optimistic future for the nation as well.\n\n\u201cSitting in one of those cars going down the highways and on the local roads, you might expect to see people holding evil signs about Trump. Instead, you see school children cheering the president\u2019s motorcade as it goes by. We never see that on the evening news or any of the cable channels. But I witnessed it,\u201d Mr. Savage said in the aftermath.\n\n\u201cWe all know we have never seen such a perversion of the truth as we have around this president. I learned things about his accomplishments that I never knew. The media created a lie and spread it each and every day. As Joseph Goebbels said, \u2018If you tell a lie often enough, it becomes the truth,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Savage continued, referring to the Nazi propaganda minister.\n\n\u201cAfter two and a half years of relentless hatred, the false witch hunt, threatening to put this president in prison and his children in prison, lies about Russia collusion, President Trump looks stronger than ever,\u201d Mr. Savage observed.\n\n\u201cHe looks better than he did when I first met him. They tried to destroy him and his family, and they failed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSomething is happening in this country. It is going in the other direction \u2014 it is going in our direction. It is going in the direction of America\u2019s survival,\u201d Mr. Savage concluded.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
