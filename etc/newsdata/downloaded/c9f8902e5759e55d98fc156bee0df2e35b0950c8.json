WeWork said in a statement that its board will be expanded and control how Neumann's shares are voted.\n\nReuters first reported on Monday that Neumann was negotiating stepping down from the board and would serve as an adviser.\n\n\"The consulting arrangement is mind boggling. It's terrible governance,\" said Nell Minow, vice chair of shareholder advisory firm ValueEdge Advisors. \"Why pay the guy who got WeWork into this mess for advice. It's adding insult to injury and a little more injury too.\"\n\nNevertheless, some WeWork investors said they supported the deal.\n\n\"Adam is a visionary who has created an impactful company which has transformed the way many people work, live and think. We think he deserved to take some money off the table for his contribution to the company,\" said All Blue Capital managing partner Matt Novak.\n\nHe declined to say how big his firm's stake in WeWork is.\n\nSoftBank said it will provide a $5 billion debt package to WeWork, comprising $1.1 billion in senior secured notes, $2.2 billion in unsecured notes, and a $1.75 billion letter of credit facility. WeWork picked SoftBank's offer over an alternative $5 billion debt package submitted on Monday by JPMorgan.\n\nSoftBank said it will also accelerate a previous $1.5 billion equity commitment to WeWork in the form of warrants that are due in April at a new price of $11.60 per share.\n\nSoftBank said it will own 80% of WeWork following the tender offer but will not be consolidating the company on its books because it will not hold a majority of voting rights. SoftBank will have four board seats on the company's expanded 10-member board, one of the source said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The deal represents a stunning reversal of fortune for WeWork as well as its largest shareholder, SoftBank Group Corp , which has committed more than $13 billion in equity to a company that is now valued at just $8 billion.
