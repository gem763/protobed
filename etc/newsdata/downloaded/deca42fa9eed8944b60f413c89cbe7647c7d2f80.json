Smolenkov, a former Kremlin official who disappeared in 2017 and is now suspected of having spied for the CIA, a top Moscow official said Thursday.\n\nMaria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said that the international law enforcement agency was asked whether it can confirm recent reports about Mr. Smolenkov having quietly relocated to northern Virginia.\n\n\u201cTwo years later, the U.S. media churns out information that he is in the U.S.,\u201d Ms. Zakharova said, Russian state media reported. \u201cNaturally, such things need verification in accordance with the corresponding procedures and rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this regard, Interpol was asked about the disappearance of a foreign citizen and his rumored presence in the United States,\u201d Ms. Zakharova said, according to the outlets.\n\nMissing since June 2017, interest in Mr. Smolenkov\u2019s whereabouts renewed this week after multiple news reports said that the CIA relied for years on an unidentified Russian government official embedded in the Kremlin before extracting the informant around the same time as the former staffer\u2019s disappearance.\n\nOutlets operating under the Russian government\u2019s control responded to the reports by naming the likely CIA mole as Mr. Smolenkov, a former member of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s administration who had reportedly disappeared while vacationing with his wife in Montenegro more than two years ago.\n\nPublicly available records show that a house was purchased in 2018 under the name of Mr. Smolenkov and his wife near D.C. in northern Virginia, and NBC News reported that journalists who tried visiting the address this week were promptly met by suspected U.S. agents monitoring the residence.\n\nCNN first reported on the unidentified CIA mole\u2019s extraction Monday, which the network said was driven in part by President Trump mishandling classified information. The New York Times corroborated elements of the reporting later Tuesday but said that media coverage was the main reasoning for the informant\u2019s removal.\n\n\u201cMisguided speculation that the president\u2019s handling of our nation\u2019s most sensitive intelligence \u2014 which he has access to each and every day \u2014 drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate,\u201d CIA director for public affairs Brittany Bramell told CNN this week.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said CNN\u2019s reporting is \u201cnot only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger,\u201d the network reported Monday.\n\nMr. Smolenkov\u2019s name was initially omitted from U.S. media reports but has since been published by outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post and Reuters.\n\nThe Times reported that the extracted informant was instrumental in providing information that allowed the U.S. intelligence community to conclude that Mr. Putin ordered Russia to attack the 2016 U.S. presidential race.\n\nNo major outlets in the U.S. have confirmed that Mr. Smolenkov is the same spy in question, however.\n\nInterpol did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
