There was a lot of smoke coming out of the exhaust,' said Martin.\n\n'They questioned my wife as to what was wrong with the car was there something she was not telling them.'\n\nHe say they then questioned his wife, saying the 'head gasket has gone', and other adding 'leave it, leave it too much money maybe \u00a31,200-1,500 to fix'.\n\nThe ring leader then suggested making an offer of \u00a31,000 - \u00a32,000 less than the asking prince - on certain 'conditions'.\n\nMartin had gone out to work when the man and his friends had called to look at the car, so he asked Natasha to go out and give them the key and allowed them to take a test drive\n\nHe became suspicious of their pressurising behaviour, and thought maybe his CCTV camera might shed some light on the situation\n\nBut luckily Natasha refused the offer and said she would need to speak to her husband.\n\nMartin, meanwhile says he knew the car was 'absolutely fine', and considered taking the car to the mechanic to get checked.\n\nHe also became suspicious of their pressurising behaviour, and thought maybe his CCTV camera might shed some light on the situation.\n\n'I looked back at the CCTV outside my home because I was very suspicious.\n\n'I looked back at the CCTV outside my home because I was very suspicious. And I was right to be you can see from the footage one of them distracts my wife inspecting the rear tyre in the boot, the other one pulls a bottle out of his jacket pours it into the car then puts it back in his jacket'\n\nMartin Hill, 34, and wife Natasha from Hythe, Kent were trying to sell their Audi A4 through a classified advertisement website\n\n'And I was right to be you can see from the footage one of them distracts my wife inspecting the rear tyre in the boot, the other one pulls a bottle out of his jacket pours it into the car then puts it back in his jacket.'\n\nIt would turn out this was used engine oil, which they poured into the coolant system. A few extra squirts into the exhaust pipe caused the smoke on the test drive.\n\n'I was so angry when I saw this footage and panicked they had caused damaged my car.'\n\nMartin confronted the man over text afterwards, saying he would go to the police if they didn't fix the damage they had caused. The man only replied, 'thanks'.\n\nThe car wasn't damaged and has since been sold, after the coolant system was flushed through. 'It was just an added bit of hassle, but glad we have it sorted,' added Martin.", "description": "Martin Hill, 34, from Hythe, Kent became suspicious of the man after he claimed the car had 'problems' on a test drive.
