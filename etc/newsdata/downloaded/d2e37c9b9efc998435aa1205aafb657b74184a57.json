'It's something that I will not forget about.\n\n'I wasn't hurting (at first). I felt like a little burn, but I don't even look at that. I know that I was hurting because of the impact and the sound. I started hurting later, probably when I was about to walk into the surgery.'", "description": "David Ortiz was in front of the cameras again Friday as an analyst for FOX Sports' coverage of the MLB playoffs at the network's Los Angeles studio, four months after he was shot.", "authors": ["Adry Torres For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19311454-0-image-a-4_1570215933173.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
