It appears his efforts have not been in vain: thanks to videos posted by DeLonge\u2019s research academy, the US Navy has confirmed that aliens do exist.\n\nThe three clips in question were shot in 2004 and 2015. One shows US Navy pilots chancing upon an unknown aircraft in San Diego, while the other two capture an unusually rotating object flying over water. DeLonge made the videos public through his To The Stars Academy in 2017 and 2018, with each racking up millions of views.\n\n(Read: The Top 100 Pop Punk Bands)\n\nBecause of the buzz surrounding the incident, the US Navy initiated an investigation, but was unable to determine the identity of the objects. As such, a spokesperson told Motherboard that \u201cthe Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those three videos as unidentified.\u201d\n\nThe finding is significant because, up until this time, the Navy has determined other unusual flying objects to be weather balloons or drones. In the case of DeLonge\u2019s video footage, however, the Navy is specifically using the label \u201cUnidentified Aerial Phenomena\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat the Navy is using the term \u2018Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\u2019 shows that they have broadened what is expected to be reported by U.S. fighter pilots to investigate anything unknown in their airspace that in the past has been connected with a stigma,\u201d Roger Glassel, a Swedish writer and UFO specialist, told Motherboard.\n\nIn the opening verse of Blink-182\u2019s Enema of the State track \u201cAliens Exist\u201d, DeLonge sings about \u201cthe creatures from above\u201d creeping \u201cin the backroom\u201d of his parents\u2019 house in\u2026 Poway, California, which is just 20 miles north of San Diego. Turns out DeLonge\u2019s been right all along these past two decades.\n\nWe imagine DeLonge is celebrating with a couple of Carvel flying saucers right now, as he makes his way across the US on his Angels and Airwaves comeback tour.
