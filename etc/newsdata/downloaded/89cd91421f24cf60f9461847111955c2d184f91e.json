We know how good they are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, just two NFL teams - the New York Giants and Pittsburgh - have allowed more yards passing per game than the 301.7 yielded by New Orleans. And it would appear the Saints (2-1) have yet to face an offense as potent as that of the Cowboys (3-0), who have yet to score fewer than 31 points in a game.\n\nDynamic Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott, who has passed for 920 yards and nine touchdowns already this season, enters Sunday night\u2019s game in the Superdome with some added personal incentive to produce a memorable performance.He grew up in the Shreveport area - the one part of Louisiana nearly split between Cowboys and Saints fans - and will be making his first NFL start in his home state.\n\nHis biggest previous game in Louisiana was in 2014 at LSU , when his dynamism put a dent in the Death Valley mystique and ended the Bulldogs\u2019 14-game losing streak against the Tigers. That was also Mississippi State\u2019s first victory in Tiger Stadium since 1991 - two years before Prescott was born.\n\nNow Prescott will try to help the Cowboys win in the Superdome for the first time since 2009, when they ended the Super Bowl-bound Saints\u2019 13-game winning streak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun, knowing this environment, knowing the Superdome, knowing how their fans are going to be, the intensity, the atmosphere,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to go in there with my team, the brotherhood we have, an us-against-the-world mentality.\u201d\n\nStopping Dallas can be hard enough when Prescott is extending plays with his scrambling ability, finding receivers such as Amari Cooper and piling up about 302 yards passing per game, which ranks fourth league-wide. Never mind the fact that Dallas\u2018 running back tandem of Ezekiel Elliott and rookie Tony Pollard , who both gained 100-plus yards against Miami last week, leads a ground game that ranks third in the NFL with 179 yards per game.\n\nWhen playing against an offense like that, Apple said he takes only one approach.\n\n\u201cGo and get it. That\u2019s all you can do. Make plays, fly around, enthusiasm and have fun with it,\u201d Apple said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to deliver the punches.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the prime story lines surrounding the Cowboys\u2019 first visit to New Orleans since 2015:\n\nTED TALKS\n\nThe Saints are entering their second full game with QB Teddy Bridgewater taking first-team snaps in place of the injured Drew Brees and expect to see progress from a unit that gained 265 yards and accounted for three of the Saints\u2019 five touchdowns in a 33-27 victory at Seattle last week. Since coach Sean Payton and Brees arrived in New Orleans in 2006, the Saints usually have been a top-five offense. But with Bridgewater under center for seven of 12 quarters, New Orleans ranks an uncharacteristic 21st in yards per game (339.7).\n\n\u201cThe thing with this coaching staff is that they\u2019re great for a reason,\u201d Bridgewater said. \u201cThey\u2019re able to call plays to where whoever\u2019s in there can do well. They play to our strengths. This past week we were able to do some things that I was comfortable doing and we had some success.\u201d\n\nBridgewater said coaches dialed back some of the usual complexities of the game plan last week because crowd noise in Seattle has been known to cause communication problems for opposing offenses.\n\n\u201cBeing back home, being able to do our own cadence, we can do more,\u201d Bridgewater said. \u201cEveryone gets enamored with numbers and seeing the ball pushed down the field. When those opportunities come, we want to take advantage of them. I just want to help this team win football games.\u201d\n\nPICKING UP THE PACE\n\nDespite missing the entire preseason in a holdout and getting eased back in the first three games, Elliott has more yards through three games than in any of his first three seasons. The two-time rushing champion is up to fourth in the NFL with 289 yards, 86 fewer than leader Dalvin Cook of Minnesota. Elliott had 274 through three games in each of the seasons he went on to win the rushing title, as a rookie in 2016 and last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really much meaning into just me having like maybe 10 more yards than I had the year before,\u201d said Elliott, who is coming off consecutive 100-yard games. \u201cWe\u2019re happy where we\u2019re at as an offense. We\u2019re running the ball really well.\u201d\n\nPRESSURE PACKAGE\n\nWith defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins recovering from an Achilles tendon tear last January, the Saints have been experimenting with three defensive ends in their four-man front. That package has paid dividends for third-year end Trey Hendrickson. He didn\u2019t have a single sack last season and often was a healthy scratch. So far this season he\u2019s leading the Saints with a career-high three sacks, followed by Cameron Jordan with two and 2018 first-round draft choice Marcus Davenport. The Saints sacked Prescott seven times, one of few flattering statistics for New Orleans in a 13-10 loss at Dallas last November.\n\nQUINN\u2019S ENCORE\n\nDefensive end Robert Quinn had a sack and a career-high seven QB pressures in his Dallas debut against Miami, his former team, coming off a two-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance enhancers. It was also the first time Quinn was paired with DeMarcus Lawrence, who had his first sack since signing a $105 million, five-year contract in the offseason.\n\n\u201cHe brings more speed,\u201d Lawrence said of his new teammate. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that can evaporate daylight is speed. Being able to have more speed on the opposing side is great for me. Now I can make any move I want.\u201d\n\nQuinn played 63 percent of the snaps (44 of 70) in the 31-6 victory against the Dolphins , who had Quinn for one season after he spent his first seven years with the Rams. The playing time was more than coaches expected after the 29-year-old broke his left hand in practice early in training camp and missed all the preseason games.\n\n\u201cFirst time I\u2019m hearing that,\u201d Quinn said of the QB pressures. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a good way to come back and make my first statement as a Cowboy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saints cornerback Eli Apple suggests that the high-powered Cowboys could bring out the best in a New Orleans defense that has been off to a shaky start.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/dolphins_cowboys_football_35649_c0-301-3590-2394_s1770x1032.jpg?a9d58fb72b60553ebf896581e35a6fadf480b8c3", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
