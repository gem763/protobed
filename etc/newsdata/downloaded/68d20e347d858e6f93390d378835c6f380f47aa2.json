RRM Canada looks at all potential cases of foreign interference, by observing emerging tactics and trends online using open source material.\"\n\nThe UCP issued a statement that afternoon calling the spread of inauthentic troll accounts online \"a disturbing trend.\"\n\n\"Albertans spoke loud and clear on Election Day when they elected a United Conservative government with 55 per cent of the popular vote and more than a million votes cast \u2014 the largest electoral victory in Alberta history,\" said spokesperson Christine Myatt.\n\n\"The growing number of inauthentic troll accounts online is a disturbing trend but as the report states, there is nothing to suggest that these accounts in any way influenced the results of the election.\"\n\nDomestic players mimicking foreign players\n\nThe RRM team identified accounts tied to lobbying groups that were spreading disinformation online in the run-up to the Alberta election. Officials would not say which groups were involved.\n\nThe team also found accounts associated with \"known national far-right and hate group actors\" using tactics similar to those deployed by \"known malign foreign actors,\" and noted a small group of anonymous accounts trying to amplify an Alberta separatist movement.\n\nGovernment officials said the domestic accounts are mimicking the online tactics deployed in other cases of foreign interference, such as the 2016 U.S. presidential election \u2014 making it hard for observers to identify the players.\n\nHowever, they were hesitant to give concrete examples for fear the accounts they're trying to monitor will change their tactics.\n\n\"The Alberta election provides an example of a situation where there may be evidence of coordinated inauthentic behaviour undertaken by Canadian actors, making the identification of foreign interference more difficult,\" says the report.\n\n\"This behaviour will make it increasingly difficult to distinguish national from foreign interference efforts in the upcoming federal election.\"\n\nIt basically shows that a lot of the misinformation, disinformation efforts are done by Canadians, for Canadians. - Stephanie Carvin, former national security analyst\n\nStephanie Carvin, a former national security analyst who now teaches at Carleton University, said the findings emphasize that not all disinformation campaigns are run out of Russia.\n\n\"Not everything in the Alberta election was the result of some kind of Russian troll factory. It basically shows that a lot of the misinformation, disinformation efforts are done by Canadians, for Canadians, probably for a variety of reasons,\" she said.\n\n\"There are efforts that are basically trying to change the debate, get certain things trending to perhaps have an outcome on the election.\"\n\nShe said the most alarming part of the report is the idea that hate groups are trying to amplify their messages on social media.\n\n\"Are these accounts being used to try and attract individuals to a certain message, a certain narrative to try and spread that?\" she said.\n\n\"That to be is the biggest concern of this report ... not so much the disinformation but the fact that extremists are using it to try and normalize and amplify their positions.\"\n\nAlberta election chosen for a reason\n\nTo draft its report, the team monitored open sources like Twitter.\n\nA source who was briefed on the report said the reason the RRM team picked Alberta rather than P.E.I. (which also had an election this year) is because it feared that Alberta's vital energy industry might be too tempting a target for foreign intelligence or pressure groups.\n\nThe source stressed that the activity noted in Alberta's campaign represent the sorts of tactics the intelligence community will be looking for over the next six weeks.\n\nBirthed out of the 2018 G7 summit in Charlevoix, the RRM unit was set up to coordinate efforts between the seven leading industrialized nations to identify, prevent and respond to threats to democracy.\n\nThe RRM also plays a role in the Security and Intelligence Threats to Election (SITE) task force, conducting open source research on global trends and data on threats to democracy.\n\nCBC has been requesting the report for weeks.
