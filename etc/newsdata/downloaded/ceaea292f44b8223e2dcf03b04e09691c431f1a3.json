The student claims that the instructor was \u201coffended\u201d by his decision to discuss the efficacy of waterboarding as an interrogation technique.\n\n\u201cI believe [the instructor] may be anti-war, pacifist, anti-interrogation, does not understand what interrogations actually are, etc. and is using this emotion to destroy my grade,\u201d the student wrote in the complaint.\n\nThe complaint system at Arizona State University, however, seems like it is mostly utilized by students that have experienced \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d on campus. One female student filed a complaint after a student offered her an energy drink as part of a prank video.\n\n\u201cIn December a group of three students was caught filming internet prank videos among the book stacks in Hayden Library,\u201d the complaint read. \u201cOne of the pranksters reportedly approached a female student pretending to need help finding a book and asked her if she wanted \u201cto bang.\u201d After he produced an energy drink from his jacket, she noticed the two other students filming the interaction and notified campus police.\u201d\n\nIn another complaint, a group of female students called a professor \u201csexist\u201d after he told them to stop talking in class.\n\n\u201cIn November a professor was reported for constantly telling a group of females in the class to stop talking and listen to the lecture,\u201d the complaint read.\u201dWhen one of the women in the group asked the professor a question, he said, \u201cyou would have known the answer if you stopped talking.\u201d She accused the professor of being \u201csexually biased\u201d against the women, saying he had \u201chindered\u201d her learning by \u201cmocking me in front of the class.\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "A veteran and student at Arizona State University filed a complaint with school officials, accusing a professor of discriminating against him over the perspective he developed during his military service.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Arizona-State-football-team-holds-flag-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
