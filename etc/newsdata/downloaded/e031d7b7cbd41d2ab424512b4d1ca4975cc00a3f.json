While one-day crude-oil CLV19, -1.41% price jumps of more than 10% are usually accompanied by losses for the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.31%, Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.52% and Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.28% on the same day, they have been, on average, followed by better-than-usual performance six months out, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nAs the chart above shows, the S&P 500 has, on average, risen 10.2% in the six months following one-day, crude-oil price spikes of 10% or more, nearly 4 percentage points higher than the 6.3% average growth of the S&P 500 during other periods. The Dow has risen 8.7% six months after a 10% crude surge, versus a typical 6.1% rise, while the Nasdaq has seen a 15.5% rise compared with a typical 8.2% ascent.\n\n\u201cThe attack in Saudi Arabia is something to watch, but it doesn\u2019t look like a major problem,\u201d said Sam Stovall, investment strategist at CFRA. \u201cThe U.S. said it would open up the strategic reserves, and the Saudis have redundancies, and as a result the effects should be offset somewhat.\u201d\n\nWhile some companies and households could bear the cost of higher oil prices, Stovall said, the increasingly large American energy sector will benefit, potentially leading to higher profits, hiring and investment for U.S. energy companies.\n\nDespite these bullish average outcomes, however, there is still reason for investor caution. In many individual instances of spikes in oil prices, the stock market was beset by significant volatility. Six months following a September 22, 2008 rise in oil prices of 15.7%,the S&P 500 fell 31.8%, as the U.S. economy found itself in a deep economic recession.\n\nAnother foreboding example is June 20, 1990, when the price of crude oil rose 10.7% in the months leading up to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. As that conflict grew over the next year, there were more than two dozen instances when crude oil prices rose more than 5% during a single trading day. Six months after the initial price spike, the S&P 500 was 8% lower.\n\nMuch of the average strength of equity markets following big changes in oil prices can be attributed to the energy sector itself. During Monday\u2019s action, the energy sector has been the only one in the green, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR fund XLE, +3.36% up 3.9% compared with a 0.3% decline for the S&P 500.\n\nThere may be reason to expect this outperformance to continue. \u201cThe energy sector has historically averaged a gain of 1.86% over all three month periods,\u201d wrote George Pearkes of Bespoke Investment Group in a Monday email to clients. \u201cBut following big one-day price gains for oil, the sector has averaged a three-month gain of 2.66%.\u201d", "description": "Benchmarks, on average, outperform following a 10% rise in the price of crude oil \u2014 but there have been some nasty drawdowns.", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR380_oil_sp_ZG_20190916123345.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
