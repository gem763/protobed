The basic phone, at $699, is cheaper than many previous iterations of the iPhone. But people wanting one of the premium models will have to shell out $999 for the iPhone 11 Pro or $1,099 for the 11 Pro Max.\n\nThose willing to chalk up the cash for one of the Pro models, targeted at professional videographers and photographers, will get a phone with three cameras on the back: telephoto, wide and ultra-wide lenses. The cameras can shoot multiple videos simultaneously. Not everyone loves the way they look, though.\n\nI don't like iPhone 11, so I'll just wait for iPhone 12#AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/esyZsk1OLQ \u2014 Chris (@classichrixs) September 10, 2019\n\nRead More", "description": "Apple unveiled the new iPhone 11 at its annual media event Tuesday, and people were quick to make their feelings about the model known on Twitter.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910183619-02-slo-mo-selfie-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
