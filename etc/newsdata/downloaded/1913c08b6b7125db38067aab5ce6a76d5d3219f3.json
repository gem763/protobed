I'm obsessed with them | Sami Bayly", "language": "en", "text": "The surinam toad is an unusual creature to behold: it has an extremely flat, splat-like body, with a posterior packed with large pores full of babies. It\u2019s as though somewhere during evolution, it took a wrong turn \u2013 and then got run over.\n\nBut of course, the adaptation has an intelligent purpose. By carrying her eggs on her back, the mother is able to lay flat against her surroundings, protecting her spawn from predators until they are ready for the world.\n\nIf you suffer from trypophobia (the fear of small, tightly packed holes), look away now.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The surinam toad, as drawn by Sami Bayly. Illustration: Hachette\n\nThe surinam toad is a perfect example of one of my obsessions: ugly animals. What may be a distressingly hideous feature to humans often belies evolutionary genius, which fascinates me so much that I wrote and illustrated a whole children\u2019s book full of them.\n\nMost people spend their lives avoiding being associated with anything regarded as \u201cugly\u201d; I find myself being drawn towards them. And drawing them.\n\nI\u2019m 23 now but It grew up in my family\u2019s home just outside of Port Macquarie in Australia, in the rural suburb of Sancrox. From an early age I found so much joy in the weird and wonderful creatures around me, from the frequent visits of Antechinus marsupials to the bandy-bandy snakes, goannas in the garden, and possums in the trees. We had a vast range of pets too \u2013 miniature ponies and donkeys, among them.\n\nOur home was always decorated with paintings by Mum, and my sister and I were fortunate enough to inherit her artistic skill. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it after studying art in high school \u2013 until Mum came across a unique course: I could get a bachelor\u2019s degree in natural history illustration.\n\nDuring my honours year I researched the connections between conservation and aesthetics, to discover the impact of an animal\u2019s appearance on how willing humans were to assist with its survival.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The naked mole rat in The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Ugly Animals. Illustration: Hachette\n\nLarge and impressive animals found in safari parks or reservations, including tigers, lions and elephants, are considered \u201ccharismatic megafauna\u201d owing to their popularity with the public. As a result, they tend to receive more press, better benefits and more donations \u2013 while less popular or \u201cugly\u201d animals are left behind.\n\nLove, hate and hypocrisy: the best books about animals and humans Read more\n\nIn his 2011 article, The New Noah\u2019s Ark, the Canadian veterinary research scientist Ernie Small compared the $2m Coca-Cola had committed to save polar bears \u2013 and the $125m commitment to the whooping crane made by a joint Canada-US recovery plan \u2013 with money promised to help endangered frogs and toads, who receive nowhere near that much.\n\n\u201cAesthetic and commercial standards have become the primary determinants of which species in the natural world deserve conservation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccordingly, the world\u2019s biodiversity is being beautified by selective conservation of attractive species, while the plight of the overwhelming majority of species is receiving limited attention.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest According to superstition, if an aye-aye points at you with its \u2018scrawny single finger\u2019, you are doomed to die. Illustration: Hachette\n\nSpecies that possess human tendencies, infant-like features, vibrant colours, symmetry and impressive proportion \u2013 or offer something we can use, such as food, medicine or clothing \u2013 are almost always going to appeal more to us. But an animal like the endangered aye-aye suffers in comparison.\n\nTo draw the aye-aye, one must take into consideration their coarse fur, bulging eyes, scrawny single finger and over-all rat-like appearance, while keeping the superstition that surrounds it in the back of one\u2019s mind: if an aye-aye points at you with its long finger, the legend goes, you\u2019ve been cursed with an imminent death.\n\nIt sounds ridiculous, but myths like these have a direct impact on their population. We need to understand this incredible species, not be afraid of it; we need to educate others on why the creature has evolved like this. It is one of only a few species to use a technique called \u201cpercussive foraging\u201d: their large ears help them hear insects inside the trees; their sharp teeth gnaw holes in the wood; and their eerily long index finger and claw helps them spear grubs found in the holes they\u2019ve made, for a tasty meal.\n\nThe helmeted hornbill is another one: critically endangered owing to land clearing for palm oil plantations, and poaching for its magnificent red ivory casque. In West Kalimantan, 6,000 birds were killed for trade purposes in 2013 alone, to create carved ornaments and jewellery from their horns.\n\nThe helmeted hornbill is wonderful to illustrate, with its enormous size, outrageous beak and textured neck. I used a range of painting techniques to capturethis weird yet wonderful bird.\n\nI hope my book will introduce others to a broader range of species \u2013 and help us care about them, regardless of how they look.\n\n\u2022 The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Ugly Animals by Sami Bayly is out now through Lothian/Hachette\n\n", "description": "Growing up in rural Australia, I found joy in the weird creatures around me \u2013 and finding out why they had evolved that way.
