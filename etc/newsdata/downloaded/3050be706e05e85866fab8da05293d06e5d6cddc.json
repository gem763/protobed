On the eve of this year's World Economic Forum, the renowned naturalist told the audience that the worlds of business and politics should \"get on with the practical solutions\" needed to prevent environmental damage. \"As a species we are expert problem solvers. But we've not yet applied ourselves to this problem with the focus it requires. \"We can create a world with clean air and water, unlimited energy, and fish stocks that will sustain us well into the future. But to do that, we need a plan,\" he said. The broadcaster made his speech after receiving a Crystal Award, which is awarded by the forum to \"exceptional cultural leaders\". AFP/Getty 2/8 At least 60% of wild coffee species face extinction triggered by climate change and disease Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world\u2019s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change. The wild strain of arabica, the most widely consumed coffee on the planet, is among those now recognised as endangered, raising concerns about its long-term survival. These results are worrying for the millions of farmers around the world who depend on the continued survival of coffee for their livelihoods. As conditions for coffee farming become tougher, scientists predict the industry will need to rely on wild varieties to develop more resilient strains Alan Schaller 3/8 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are melting The Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown. More than half an inch has been added to global sea levels since 1979, but if current trends continue it will be responsible for metres more in future, the Nasa-funded study found. The international effort used aerial photos, satellite data and climate models dating back to the 1970s across18 Antarctic regions to get the most complete picture to date on the impacts of the changing climate. It found that between 1979 and 1990 Antarctica lost an average of 40 gigatonnes (40 billion tonnes) of its mass each year. Between 2009 and 2017 it lost an average 252 gigatonnes a year. This has added 3.6mm per decade to sea levels, or around 14mm since 1979, the study shows Nasa/Getty 4/8 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industry Greater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry. All of the region\u2019s 10 councils are to implement planning policies which create a \u201cpresumption\u201d against drilling for shale gas in their areas, Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has announced. Campaigners said the move was the latest sign that the tide was turning against fracking, which has been the subject of multiple legal battles across the country. Critics of fracking say it poses environmental and health risks. Drilling at the UK\u2019s only operational fracking site, run by Cuadrilla in Lancashire, has repeatedly been halted due to earth tremors. But ministers support the industry and last year unveiled plans to accelerate the development of new drilling sites Ross Wills 5/8 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next year Japan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said his nation would leave the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to resume hunting the marine mammals in Japanese waters. However, he stated the activity would be limited to Japan\u2019s territory and the 200 mile exclusive economic zone along its coasts. This means controversial \u201cscientific\u201d trips to Antarctica in which Japanese vessels killed hundreds of whales, as well as activity in the northwest Pacific, will stop in 2019 AP 6/8 COP24: Environmental groups criticise \u2018morally unacceptable\u2019 climate deal reached after major Poland summit Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.

Activists cautiously welcomed elements of the plan, saying \u201cimportant progress\u201d had been made on ensuring that efforts to tackle climate change by individual nations can be measured and compared. But environmental groups were also highly critical of the agreement, warning it lacked ambition and clarity on key issues, including financing for climate projects for developing countries.

By contrast, more than half of all new cars sold in Norway last year were electric.\n\nElisabeth Costa, senior director at the Behavioural Insights Team, which is part-owned by the Cabinet Office, said green number plates are a way to further boost awareness of the shift to zero-emissions motoring.\n\n\u201cThe number of clean vehicles on our roads is increasing but we don\u2019t notice as it\u2019s difficult to tell clean vehicles apart from more polluting ones.\n\n\u201cGreen number plates make these vehicles and our decision to drive in a more environmentally-friendly way more visible on roads.\n\n\u201cWe think making the changing social norm noticeable will help encourage more of us to swap our cars for cleaner options.\u201d\n\nTransport is now the largest contributor to Britain\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. While electricity to power our homes has become significantly greener in recent years thanks to the closure of a number of coal-fired power stations, emissions from vehicles are on the rise.\n\nMotorists have a big part to play in meeting UK climate change targets with passenger cars accounting for 70 per cent of all transport emissions.\n\nHowever, motorists\u2019 groups questioned the proposed introduction of green number plates, with the RAC claiming that they could \u201cfoster resentment\u201d among owners of conventionally fuelled vehicles.\n\nRAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: \u201cOn the face of it, drivers we\u2019ve questioned don\u2019t seem too impressed. Only a fifth think it\u2019s a good idea and the majority said the number plates wouldn\u2019t have the effect of making them any more likely to switch to an electric vehicle.\u201d", "description": "Electric\u00a0cars could\u00a0be issued\u00a0green number plates as part of plans to incentivise cleaner vehicles in a bid\u00a0to\u00a0tackle climate change and dangerous levels of airborne pollution.", "authors": ["Ben Chapman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/08/Green-plates.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
