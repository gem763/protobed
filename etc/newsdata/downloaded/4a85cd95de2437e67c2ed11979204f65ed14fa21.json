Commercial satellite photography purchased by the Washington-based, nonpartisan Institute for Science and International Security shows the site being gradually emptied of multiple large containers between July and September of 2018, following Israel\u2019s heist earlier that year of a huge cache of Iranian nuclear documents.\n\nAs for the I.A.E.A., the agency only got around to inspecting the site earlier this year, long after the suspicious materials had vanished, and Amano died in July. But nuclear inspectors were nonetheless able to detect radioactive particles, corroborating Israeli claims about the purpose of the warehouse. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran is now refusing to answer the agency\u2019s questions about just what material was stored at the warehouse \u2014 and, more importantly, where it might be now.\n\nSo what\u2019s new?\n\nSome defenders of the 2015 nuclear deal are prone to answer: Not a lot. Traces of radioactive material may be the residue of Iran\u2019s old nuclear-weapons program, which is generally thought to have been shuttered around 2003. Tehran has always been notoriously recalcitrant when it comes to responding to the I.A.E.A. And after the Iraq W.M.D. debacle, it\u2019s wise to avoid drawing stark conclusions from incomplete and possibly false nuclear evidence.\n\nThen again, the history of nuclear inspections has more false negatives than it does false positives, including the agency\u2019s past failures to find Iran\u2019s secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Arak. Its unwillingness to follow up promptly and effectively on Israel\u2019s allegations about Turquz Abad, along with its reluctance to disclose what it found, inspire little confidence in the quality of its inspections and even less in its willingness to call out cheating.\n\nAs for Iran, hiding nuclear materials is a violation of its basic reporting obligations to the I.A.E.A. It\u2019s also further evidence that Tehran was in violation of the nuclear deal from the moment it was signed. \u201cIf Iranians aren\u2019t cooperating, it tells you that potentially they are hiding more,\u201d notes the Institute for Science and International Security president, David Albright, adding that the Turquz Abad findings are \u201ca big deal.\u201d", "description": "Iran\u2019s nuclear violations raise the stakes for Israel.", "authors": ["Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/opinion/05stephensWeb/05stephensWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
