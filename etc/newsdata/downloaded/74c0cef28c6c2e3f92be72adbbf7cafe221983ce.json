Reports 2019 Third Quarter Results", "language": "en", "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 29, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR) (the \"Company\"), a leading owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the United States and a member of the S&P 500, announced operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.\n\nHighlights for the three months ended September 30, 2019:\n\nHighlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2019:\n\nJoe Margolis, CEO of Extra Space Storage Inc., commented: \"Our diversified portfolio and strong operating platform continue to produce solid results despite headwinds from new supply. Occupancy has remained near all-time highs and same-store revenue increased 3.3% in the quarter. We also continue to find external growth opportunities through innovative structures and leveraging industry relationships, creating additional value for our shareholders.\"\n\nFFO Per Share:\n\nThe following table outlines the Company's FFO and Core FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The table also provides a reconciliation to GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for each period presented (amounts shown in thousands, except share and per share data \u2014 unaudited):\n\nExtra Space Storage LP (the \"Operating Partnership\") has outstanding preferred and common Operating Partnership units (\"OP units\"). These OP units can be redeemed for cash or, at the Company's election, shares of the Company's common stock. Redemption of all OP units for common stock has been assumed for purposes of calculating the weighted average number of shares \u2014 diluted as presented above. The computation of weighted average number of shares \u2014 diluted for FFO per share and Core FFO per share also includes the effect of share-based compensation plans and our exchangeable senior notes using the treasury stock method.\n\nAdjustment to account for the difference between the number of shares used to calculate earnings per share and the number of shares used to calculate FFO per share. Earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, which uses a lower number of shares than the calculation for FFO per share and Core FFO per share, which are calculated assuming full redemption of all OP units as described in note (3).\n\nOperating Results and Same-Store Performance:\n\nThe following table outlines the Company's same-store performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (amounts shown in thousands, except store count data\u2014unaudited)1:\n\nA reconciliation of net income to same-store net operating income is provided later in this release, entitled \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Total Same-Store Net Operating Income.\"\n\nSame-store revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased due to higher net rental rates for customers. Same-store expenses were higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to increases in marketing expenses and property taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 expenses were partially offset by decreases in payroll and benefits and utilities expenses.\n\nMajor markets with revenue growth above the Company's portfolio average for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 included Cincinnati, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Norfolk/Virginia Beach, Oklahoma City and Phoenix. Major markets performing below the Company's portfolio average included Charleston, Denver, Houston, Miami, Tampa and West Palm Beach/Boca Raton.\n\nInvestment and Third-Party Management Activity:\n\nThe following table outlines the Company's acquisitions and developments that are closed, completed or under agreement (dollars in thousands - unaudited):\n\nThe buyout of JV partners' interest in stores is reported at the value of the partners' ownership interest less the value of the Company's promoted interest.\n\nThe locations of C of O and development stores and joint venture ownership interest details are included in the supplemental financial information published on the Company's website at www.extraspace.com.\n\nThe projected developments and acquisitions under agreement described above are subject to customary closing conditions and no assurance can be provided that these developments and acquisitions will be completed on the terms described, or at all.\n\nPreferred Stock Investment:\n\nOn October 29, 2019, the Company invested $150.0 million in shares of newly issued convertible preferred stock of SmartStop Self Storage REIT, Inc.

The additional commitment, on which the Company will receive a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum, may be drawn by SmartStop over the next 12 months. The dividend rate for the preferred shares is 6.25% per annum, subject to increase after five years. The preferred shares are generally not redeemable for five years, except in the case of a change of control or initial listing of SmartStop.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet Lease:\n\nOn August 1, 2019, the Company commenced leasing an additional five stores under its net lease agreements with W.P. Carey Inc. (\"WPC\"). These stores were the second of three groups of stores that will be leased by WPC to the Company.

Forward-looking statements include statements concerning the benefits of store acquisitions, developments, favorable market conditions, our outlook and estimates for the year and other statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, the competitive landscape, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and developments and other information that is not historical information. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"anticipates,\" or \"intends,\" or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. We may also make additional forward-looking statements from time to time. All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by us or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in or contemplated by this release. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the risks referenced in the \"Risk Factors\" section included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Such factors include, but are not limited to:\n\nadverse changes in general economic conditions, the real estate industry and the markets in which we operate;\n\nfailure to close pending acquisitions and developments on expected terms, or at all;\n\nthe effect of competition from new and existing stores or other storage alternatives, which could cause rents and occupancy rates to decline;\n\npotential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;\n\nthe impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those governing real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"), tenant reinsurance and other aspects of our business, which could adversely affect our results;\n\ndisruptions in credit and financial markets and resulting difficulties in raising capital or obtaining credit at reasonable rates or at all, which could impede our ability to grow;\n\nincreases in interest rates;\n\nreductions in asset valuations and related impairment charges;\n\nour lack of sole decision-making authority with respect to our joint venture investments;\n\nthe effect of recent changes to U.S. tax laws;\n\nthe failure to maintain our REIT status for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and\n\neconomic uncertainty due to the impact of natural disasters, war or terrorism, which could adversely affect our business plan.\n\nAll forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations and various assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, but there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. All forward-looking statements apply only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n\nDefinition of FFO:\n\nFFO provides relevant and meaningful information about the Company's operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of the Company's operating results. The Company believes FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net income. Net income assumes that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and the Company believes FFO more accurately reflects the value of the Company's real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (\"NAREIT\") as net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. The Company believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\nFor informational purposes, the Company also presents Core FFO. Core FFO excludes revenues and expenses not core to our operations and non-cash interest. Although the Company's calculation of Core FFO differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, the Company believes it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance. The Company believes that by excluding revenues and expenses not core to our operations and non-cash interest charges, stockholders and potential investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Core FFO by the Company should not be considered a replacement of the NAREIT definition of FFO. The computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an indicator of the Company's ability to make cash distributions.\n\nDefinition of Same-Store:\n\nThe Company's same-store pool for the periods presented consists of 821 stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. The Company considers a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80.0% or more for one calendar year. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to occupancy, rental revenue (growth), operating expenses (growth), net operating income (growth), etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company's stores as a whole.\n\nAbout Extra Space Storage Inc.:\n\nExtra Space Storage Inc., headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and a member of the S&P 500.
