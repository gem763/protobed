It's often difficult to untangle what is cause and effect, especially when some serious conditions, such as coronary heart disease, can be largely symptom-free for decades prior to a critical complication such as a heart attack,\" he told the Science Media Centre (SMC) in London.\n\nNaveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said that while the study was \"somewhat interesting\", it seems that those who nap once or twice a week have healthier or organized lifestyles, but that those who napped daily were likely to be more sick.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"This means the former pattern of occasional napping is intentional and the latter of more regular napping likely represents sub-clinical illness linked to poorer lifestyle. This would then explain the differential risks,\" Sattar told the SMC.\n\n\"I don't think one can work out from this work whether \"intentional\" napping on one or two days per week improves heart health so no one should take from this that napping is a way to lessen their heart attack risk,\" he added.\n\n\"For now, far better to aim for regular good night's sleep and to follow usual lifestyle advice of good diets and decent activity levels.\"", "description": "Some good news for nap fanatics -- a new study has found that a daytime nap taken once or twice a week could lower the risk of heart attacks or strokes.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910103927-nap-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
