It quoted people familiar with the discussions.\n\nCoalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told reporters in Riyadh earlier on Monday that authorities were still determining the launch location.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cThe terrorist attack did not originate from Yemen as the Houthi militia claimed,\u201d he said, adding that authorities would reveal the location from where drones were launched at a future news conference.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim countries intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital Sanaa, to prevent Iran from gaining influence through the group.\n\nThe movement, which denies being a puppet of Tehran and says it is fighting a corrupt system, recently stepped up drone and missile attacks on Saudi cities. The conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "description": "Saudi Arabia said on Monday that the attack on its oil facilities was carried out with Iranian weapons, according to a preliminary investigation, but stopped short of directly blaming regional foe Iran.", "authors": ["Stephen Kalin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430504108&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F14U", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
