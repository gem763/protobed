Draghi will step down at the end of the month, completing a non-renewable eight-year term that saw him win credit for preserving the euro and modernizing the ECB while also creating division over his aggressive policies.\n\nRead: Mario Draghi saved the euro, but leaves ECB at a crossroads\n\nEarlier Thursday, the ECB, as expected, made no changes to its monetary policy settings. It left interest rates unchanged and affirmed its plan to begin making net asset purchases of \u20ac20 billion a month as it resumes its quantitative easing strategy.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.3055% was weaker versus the U.S. dollar following Draghis\u2019 comments and a raft of U.S. economic data, slipping 0.2% to $1.1109. European stocks were modestly higher, with the Stoxx 600 Europe SXXP, +0.59% up 0.5%, while across the pond the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.23% was near unchanged and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.08% ticked slightly lower.\n\nDraghi said economic data since the ECB\u2019s September meeting confirmed the previous assessment of \u201cprotracted weakness in euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risks and muted inflation pressures.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all gloom, however, with Draghi arguing that \u201congoing employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience\u201d of the eurozone economy. All in all, the monetary policy measures implemented by the ECB at its last meeting were set to provide \u201csubstantial monetary stimulus,\u201d which will support the eurozone expansion, a buildup in domestic price pressures and, ultimately, push stubbornly low inflation back up toward the bank\u2019s target of near but just below 2%.\n\nOpinion: Draghi leaves ECB in full-blown stimulus mode\n\nThe ECB\u2019s decision in September to cut interest rates, pushing the deposit rate further into negative territory at minus 0.5%, and to relaunch its asset buying program was controversial.\n\nThe restart of quantitative easing or QE \u2014 effectively creating money to buy assets \u2014 was sharply opposed by several policy makers, news reports noted, with German Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot disagreeing publicly with the decision.\n\nDraghi played down the divisions, saying one of the dissenters at the previous meeting had called for unity in implementing the decision, while another said \u201cbygones are bygones.\u201d\n\nDraghi said he had no advice for Christine Lagarde, a former French finance minister and ex-head of the International Monetary Fund, who will take the helm of the ECB on Nov. 1, calling her well-equipped to forge her own path. Economists, however, have argued that the ECB\u2019s policy actions have effectively exhausted its toolbox as Lagarde takes the helm.\n\nAnd Draghi is keeping his helmet. The ECB chief, who was given a spiked Prussian helmet by German tabloid Bild in 2012, cited the German saying, \u201cGeschenkt ist geschenkt,\u201d or a gift is a gift, to laugh off the suggestion that the newspaper apparently wants it back. Bild has been particularly critical of Draghi and the ECB\u2019s recent policy actions, last month creating a photo illustration of a fanged Draghi who they likened to Count Dracula for \u201csucking\u201d money from German savers with low and negative interest rates.", "description": "Mario Draghi, in his final news conference as president of the European Central Bank on Thursday, reiterates a downbeat outlook for the eurozone economy and...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT927_draghi_ZG_20191024100716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
