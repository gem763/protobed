An investigation by California law enforcement authorities is ongoing.\n\nWith the results of the California Horse Racing Board\u2019s own investigation still pending, Breeders\u2019 Cup officials were out in force on Wednesday to explain measures put in place to ensure horse safety this week.\n\n\u2013 Unprecedented scrutiny \u2013\n\n\u201cNo horses racing anywhere have been more examined or more observed than these horses,\u201d said veterinarian Debbie Lamparter, who leads a team of on-site vets that will number 30 on Breeders\u2019 Cup race days.\n\nLamparter said every Breeders\u2019 Cup entrant had already been examined on site, and would be seen by vets at least three times before racing.\n\nVets will observe horses \u201cat rest and in motion\u201d in their stable areas, and vets posted around the track will watch them work and if they see any troubling signs refer the animal for diagnostic tests.\n\nDr. William Farmer, Breeders\u2019 Cup Out-of-Competition Veterinarian and Advisor, said 252 potential Breeders\u2019 Cup runners had been drug-tested since June in seven US racing jurisdictions, Canada, France, Ireland and England.\n\nNot all of them even made it to the 14-race showpiece meeting, but of those who have, 98 percent were tested before they got here.\n\nHe said out-of-competition tests were \u201caimed at the non-therapeutics, those are the medications that do not belong in a horse that are known for affecting a horse\u2019s performance.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the usual blood tests, testing of hair samples was added for 10 percent of the horses, and some of the 2-year-olds were tested for bisphosphonate \u2014 a drug used to treat osteoporis in humans and approved to treat navicular syndrome, a painful hoof bone ailment, in older horses.\n\nSome in racing fear its use in younger horses is hiding problems that could contribute to injury.\n\nFarmer said that as of Wednesday, with testing continuing until race day, there had been \u201cno positives, no suspicious samples.\u201d\n\nWhile no single factor has been pinpointed as the major contributing cause of the Santa Anita breakdowns, Fravel said that amid the controversy he had seen a new willingness in a traditional sport to tackle problems which extend beyond Santa Anita and California.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Major attitude change\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s very clear that horse racing, which is a traditional sport, has a new sense of openness, a new sense of transparency and a willingness to change and that\u2019s the first step to getting something done,\u201d he said.\n\nRick Arthur, the California Horse Racing Board\u2019s equine medical officer, said he had seen a \u201cmajor attitude change\u201d with horsemen now supporting regulatory changes they had resisted in the past.\n\nPatchwork, state-by-state regulation makes it even harder to make changes in America, and Fravel is among those in favor of national oversight \u2014 as recommended in legislation introduced in the US House of Representatives this year.\n\n\u201cEven without a legislative solution, I\u2019m very confident that almost all of the things that are being done here at Santa Anita will be adopted on a national basis,\u201d said Fravel, who has testified twice before Congress. \u201cWill we have perfect uniformity in the next six months? No.\n\n\u201cBut I think in terms of the things that really matter we\u2019re getting very close to that.\u201d", "description": "Arcadia (United States) (AFP) \u2013 As Santa Anita Park continues to grapple with the fallout from 36 horse deaths so far this season, Breeders\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/e30e9c_santa-anita-host-breeders-cup-week-shadow-spike-in-fatalities-earlier-year-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
