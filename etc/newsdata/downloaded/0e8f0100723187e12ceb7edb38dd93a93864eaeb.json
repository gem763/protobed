Amazon posted third quarter earnings this afternoon, boasting sales of $70 billion and profit of $2.1 billion. While sales blew past analyst expectations, thanks largely to a record-setting Prime Day, the profit came in far under.\n\nThe culprit: higher shipping and other fulfillment costs Amazon is now incurring in its quest to deliver ever more packages at higher frequency. The company said it spent nearly 50 percent more on shipping and fulfillment in the last three months than this time a year ago, up to $9.6 billion. That includes not just the cost of getting the packages to the customers\u2019 doors through a variety of methods, but also its expansion \u2013 on air, land, and sea \u2014 in the logistics business.\n\nAmazon wants to make it easier than ever to buy everything from Amazon\n\n\u201cWe are ramping up to make our 25th holiday season the best ever for Prime customers \u2014 with millions of products available for free one-day delivery,\u201d said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. \u201cCustomers love the transition of Prime from two days to one day \u2014 they\u2019ve already ordered billions of items with free one-day delivery this year. It\u2019s a big investment, and it\u2019s the right long-term decision for customers. And although it\u2019s counterintuitive, the fastest delivery speeds generate the least carbon emissions because these products ship from fulfillment centers very close to the customer \u2014 it simply becomes impractical to use air or long ground routes. Huge thanks to all the teams helping deliver for customers this holiday.\u201d\n\nThe company announced earlier this year that it would start testing a shift from Prime two-day shipping to one-day shipping. That\u2019s on top of its existing services like Prime Now, which offers same-day shipping of certain products in certain markets, and Whole Foods grocery delivery, among many others spanning food and household item delivery. The company has also been aggressively building out its contract delivery service, Amazon Flex, and even started exploring robotic ground delivery. Drones for package delivery by air are also still in the works.\n\nThe company\u2019s saving grace continues to be Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division that brought in $9 billion in sales, with nearly 40 percent of that translating to profit. Amazon also makes up for high spending with sales of its Echo devices, sales from third-party Marketplace sellers, and through expansion of its Prime membership subscription. Another important growth area for Amazon is its ads division, which pulled in $3 billion this past quarter.\n\nBut of course, all of that is an interlocking system that depends on customers buying an increasing amount of products from Amazon, and the company thinks one-day shipping will give it an even tighter grip. After all, you\u2019re less likely to buy from a brick-and-mortar store if you can get a product on Amazon the same day or the following day, rather than waiting two days.", "description": "Amazon\u2019s business tends to oscillate between periods of extreme high-spending and extreme profitability, and the company is now fully in the former.
