Until the coffee was served.\n\nAccording to a report published Thursday from a branch of Britain\u2019s Department for Transport, the mishap that followed disrupted the plane\u2019s communications systems, caused a burning smell in the cockpit, prompted pilots to use oxygen and forced the flight with 326 passengers aboard to land in Shannon, Ireland. It also necessitated a new coffee-service policy.\n\nFor whatever reason, namely the size of the cup vs. the size of the cup holder, the pilot on flight DE2116 put his cup of coffee, sans lid, on a tray table.\n\n\n\n(Washington Post illustration; iStock)\n\n\u201cIn the [Airbus] A330, flight crew were provided with a table in front of them, and it was a natural place to put a drink momentarily,\u201d the UK\u2019s latest Air Accidents Investigation Branch Bulletin says. \u201cHowever, objects here are vulnerable to being knocked over because it is a fold-out table in a small space.\u201d The report also notes that Airbus \u201chighly recommends\u201d that every item in the cockpit go in its assigned place. \u201cCups in the cup holders,\u201d the bulletin quotes an Airbus manual as saying.\n\nAround 4:20 p.m., according to the bulletin, \u201cthe cup was knocked over\u201d while the plane was flying over the Atlantic. Most of the coffee ended up on the pilot\u2019s lap, but a small amount spilled onto his audio control panel on the center console. Despite efforts to dry the liquid quickly, the audio unit \u2014 used to make announcements to the plane and for VHF transmissions \u2014 malfunctioned right away. By 5 p.m., it became \u201cvery hot and failed,\u201d creating an electrical burning smell in the cockpit.\n\n[Turns out, misbehaving on a plane could cost you big money]\n\nShortly after, around 5:20 p.m., the co-pilot\u2019s audio control panel had heated up enough that a button melted. It too failed, and smoke could be seen coming from the first panel. At that point, the bulletin said, the pilot decided to turn the plane around and land in Shannon. Because of the audio control failures, the pilot could not hear or transmit messages and had to rely on the co-pilot\u2019s speaker to hear any transmissions.\n\n\u201cDuring the diversion, the flight crew alternately used supplementary oxygen, with one pilot on oxygen at all times,\u201d the report said.\n\nAt the time, local media reported that the flight made an emergency landing at 7:13 p.m. in Shannon, with five people taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation. The Department for Transport report does not say which airline was involved in the incident, but Condor \u2014 which is part of British travel company Thomas Cook Group \u2014 confirmed that it operated the flight.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the airline said the diversion was a \u201cprecautionary measure due to a minor amount of smoke in the cockpit after a liquid spillage.\u201d The flight continued by way of Manchester, because of the crew\u2019s legal operating hours, after the plane was inspected and repaired.\n\nBoth audio units were taken out and stripped down as part of an investigation. The vendor, according to the British bulletin, said the initial panel failed because of an electrical short caused by liquid contamination. It was not clear what caused the second panel to fail. Condor said in its statement that the airline \u201ccomprehensively investigated\u201d the situation and has since gone over the procedures for liquid in the cockpit.\n\n\u201cOur crews were reminded of a careful handling as well as to use appropriate containers for their water or coffee,\u201d the statement says.\n\nIn the \u201csafety actions\u201d section of its report, the British bulletin said the airline will make sure lids are provided for cups on all routes \u2014 and will supply cups that fit in the plane\u2019s cup holders.\n\nRead more:\n\nPassengers were in for a long flight delay.
