We know it will be a big contest next week in the forwards so those parts of the game were important,\u201d Cheika said.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re in the knockout stages we have to keep building now we\u2019re here. I think we\u2019re getting a platform but we need to be sharper in attack.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s hopes of a first fast start of the tournament were quickly quashed by a steely Georgia defence which had already made 100 tackles before scrumhalf Nic White nipped over the line to open the scoring in the 23rd minute.\n\nNo more tries were to follow before the break but Australia\u2019s problems with the high tackle did return in the 35th minute when number eight Isi Naisarani was sent to the sin bin for an arm into the face of Georgian lock Giorgi Nemsadze.\n\nSoso Matiashvili and Matt To\u2019omua exchanged penalties to give Australia a 10-3 halftime lead but their frequent handling errors hampered their efforts to break clear at the start of the second half.\n\nGeorgia, marshalled by totemic flanker Mamuka \u201cGorgodzilla\u201d Gorgodze, stuck manfully to their defensive task defying Australia\u2019s superiority in possession and territory with 201 tackles.\n\nIn the end, it took a dazzling individual effort from Marika Koroibete to make the second-half breakthrough with the big winger weaving his way past four defenders to touch down on the hour mark.\n\nGeorgia were not done yet, though, and winger Alexander Todua got the biggest cheer of the night from the rain-drenched crowd when he tore down the left wing to score 10 minutes from time.\n\nLoose forward Jack Dempsey and scrumhalf Will Genia crossed for tries in the last five minutes to earn Australia a bonus point they did not need and add a bit of respectability to the scoreline.\n\nAustralia\u2019s win means Mamuka \u201cGorgodzilla\u201d Gorgodze heads into retirement without the win over a tier one team he so coveted and captain Merab Sharikadze said they would need to improve in attack if they were to achieve it.\n\n\u201cWe fought well,\u201d the centre said. \u201cHopefully in the future we can be more productive in attack as well.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t win the game unless you score more points. Yeah we had really good defence and I am proud of my team but we need to improve a lot.\u201d", "description": "Australia made heavy work of it in difficult conditions but outlasted a tough Georgia team to round out their Rugby World Cup Pool D campaign with an unconvincing 27-8 victory at Shizuoka Stadium on Friday.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439688400&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A180", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
