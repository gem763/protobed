Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine, and Rick Perry, the energy secretary, began coordinating with Mr. Giuliani, who insisted the Ukrainians put out a statement committing to a series of investigations. The ambassador will say that he failed to appreciate how Burisma, a company that Mr. Giuliani wanted the Ukranians to look into, was directly tied to Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cAlthough Mr. Giuliani did mention the name \u2018Burisma\u2019 in August 2019, I understood that Burisma was one of many examples of Ukrainian companies run by oligarchs and lacking the type of corporate governance structures found in Western companies,\u201d Mr. Sondland will say. \u201cI did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s involvement with Burisma had been widely reported beginning in the spring.\n\nStill, Mr. Sondland\u2019s prepared testimony leaves unaddressed obvious questions that investigators are sure to press him to answer. It offers no real explanation of why Mr. Giuliani was involved in Ukraine policy in the first place or if Mr. Sondland took any steps to find out why.\n\nNor do the prepared remarks explain whether Mr. Sondland questioned why Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump repeatedly singled out two topics for investigation that would have benefited the president politically.\n\n\u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign,\u201d he will say.", "description": "Gordon D.
