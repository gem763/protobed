The group also spoke to representatives from financial institutions and businesses operating in the region about the challenges of implementing sanctions in these African countries.\n\nOne key recommendation to make sanctions programs in Sub-Saharan Africa more effective: Use targeted network sanctions, a practice that involves blacklisting the primary sanction target as well as the individuals and entities that are acting on behalf of or providing support for them, such as financiers, according to the report.\n\nSuch sanctions programs are more effective than comprehensive sanctions applied broadly against an entire country or sanctions against individuals without also targeting their support networks, the report says.\n\nThe recommendation draws from evidence that some sanctions targeting specific networks had been used in the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan and had some impact, including seeing implementation and some measurable behavior changes from the sanctions targets, Ms. Mossberg said.\n\nThe report also recommended that policy makers combine sanctions programs with diplomacy and clear messaging. \u201cBetter messaging is crucial for the success of any sanctions program,\u201d Ms. Mossberg said.\n\nWrite to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com", "description": "Sanctions programs levied on some Sub-Saharan African countries could be made more effective by targeting specific networks rather than comprehensive sanctions against an entire country, a new report says.", "authors": ["Mengqi Sun"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120568/social", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
