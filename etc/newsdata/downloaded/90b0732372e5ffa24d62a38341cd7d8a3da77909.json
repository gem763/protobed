But before these regulations could be imposed, the cigarette companies went on the defensive. Led by Fred Royster, a wealthy and well-connected warehouseman-grower known in North Carolina as \u201cMr. Tobacco,\u201d and industry trade groups like the well-funded Tobacco Institute, the companies\u2019 allies convinced Congress to eliminate the warnings for ads and water down the warning label to appear on cigarette packages. Instead of requiring, \u201cCigarette Smoking Is Hazardous to Your Health,\u201d they proposed the weaker wording, \u201cCigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health.\u201d The companies\u2014aided by DC super-lawyer (and soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice) Abe Fortas\u2014then engineered a sweetheart deal with the Department of Justice under which they could regulate their own advertising.\n\nWith the traditional mechanics of federal regulation effectively neutered, savvy public interest lawyers turned to more creative approaches. Led by the unconventional 27-year-old legal wunderkind John Banzhaf, these lawyers convinced the federal government that it had to require primetime advertisements that showed not only \u201cthe pleasures of the smoker\u2019s life\u201d but also \u201cthe horrors of a smoker\u2019s death.\u201d One such ad featured Bill Talman, the actor who portrayed the district attorney who lost his case each week to Perry Mason, speaking about his lung cancer diagnosis: \u201cTake some advice about smoking and losing from someone who\u2019s been doing both for years.\u201d By the time the ad aired, he was dead.\n\nBanzhaf, meanwhile, became a law professor at George Washington University and founded Action on Smoking and Health from his faculty office. He began corralling his students to sue agencies, successfully demanding the creation of non-smoking sections on planes. His motto was, \u201cSue the Bastards.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs the 1960s became the 1970s, the philosophy of deregulation took hold. Liberals wary of the corporate capture of agencies joined conservatives skeptical of big government stifling big business, and together they convinced the government to weaken the rules requiring nonsmoking sections. As the power of agencies continued to weaken throughout the 1970s, another strategy for change had to emerge. And one did: the nonsmokers\u2019 rights movement.\n\nIn 1971, a housewife in Maryland named Clara Gouin, whose youngest daughter was allergic to smoke, founded Group Against Smoking Pollution. GASP quickly spread through college towns and liberal enclaves, aiming to make what they called a \u201csilent majority\u201d as visible as possible. From Berkeley to Flint, members raised awareness of their cause and politely requested non-smoking areas at their places of work and leisure. Other activists\u2014some affiliated with GASP, others affiliated with Banzhaf\u2019s ASH or acting on their own\u2014sued their workplaces, arguing that they had a \u201cright\u201d to freedom from smoke.\n\nThe nonsmokers\u2019 rights movement emerged a decade before the evidence linking cancer with the inhalation of secondhand smoke. \u201cThe impulse behind calls for nonsmokers\u2019 rights was civic, not scientific,\u201d Milov writes. \u201cIt rested upon nonsmokers\u2019 assertion of virtuous citizenship, and was fueled by a resentment of smokers.\u201d Nonsmokers resented the entitlement of their smoking peers, the refusal to consider the feelings of those nearby whenever they lit up. And while Milov is often a bit hard on GASP, critiquing its adoption of the rhetoric of \u201cliberation\u201d even while ensconced within the \u201csafe confines of suburban liberalism,\u201d she insightfully charts how its members and other activists simultaneously scored big wins and let the cigarette companies off the hook in the process.\n\nAs their lawsuits met with only mixed success, middle-class activists began appealing to businesses directly, arguing that restricting smoking could be good for their bottom line\u2014decreased sick days, reduced disability costs, less housekeeping (because smoking damaged equipment and upholstery), and smaller legal fees (because smokers were involved in twice as many accidents as nonsmokers, and nonsmokers might sue to define smoke as an occupational health hazard). A generation of neoliberal economists, and many insurance companies, agreed. (And as a result, insurance companies began selectively selling policies at reduced rates to nonsmokers.) \u201cAmbient tobacco smoke represented a silent drain on company resources,\u201d Milov observes, \u201ca metaphor, perhaps, for the hidden costs of smokers themselves.\u201d The businesses saw the light and nonsmoking policies became increasingly common throughout the 1980s.\n\nThis happened over the fierce opposition of organized labor. The unions had fought hard to win smoke breaks in the 1940s, and, if these had to go, they wanted it to be on their terms, through collective bargaining. Yet, by the 1980s, organized labor had lost much of its power. The tactics of nonsmoking activists ensured that they\u2019d have even less. And smoke breaks\u2014unproductive time during which workers could bond\u2014were eliminated, with nothing but more work to take their place. \u201cBy relying upon cost-centered analyses of private behavior and unraveling decades-old collectivist programs,\u201d Milov writes, \u201cthe nonsmokers\u2019 rights movement refashioned what Americans believed the government owed to citizens, and what citizens owed to the government. And in their remarkable successes, they unwittingly catalyzed a conservative political strategy whose far-reaching effects are scarcely fathomable, and all too real.\u201d\n\nThe tobacco farmers suffered too. By the 1980s, Republicans had become more skeptical of the federal tobacco program, of big government interfering with the free market; Democrats had become more skeptical of Big Tobacco, and especially its biggest congressional champion, Jesse Helms. Even Big Tobacco had soured on the federal program, since it was buying more and more leaf from farmers overseas who would grow for much cheaper. (By the end of the twentieth century, 90 percent of flue-cured and Burley tobacco was grown outside the United States.) After being weakened repeatedly over the years, the federal tobacco program finally ended in 2004. Since then, tobacco has been grown on one-year contracts between companies, which can effectively dictate whatever prices they want, and individual growers, who lack any collective bargaining rights.\n\nSmokers are now poorer and less educated than nonsmokers; they have higher rates of cancer; and they are constantly told it is all their fault.\n\nWhen the reckoning finally came for Big Tobacco, its influence over the government ensured it would be insufficient. For years, state governments had been battling with the largest cigarette companies, demanding that they pay for the immense tobacco-related healthcare costs left in their wake. In the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, the companies agreed to pay more than $200 billion to state governments for 25 years (actually a paltry sum compared to the costs of tobacco-related illnesses), but in exchange, they got something they wanted much more: \u201can end to class-action lawsuits and a cap on punitive judgments for individual suits.\u201d The state governments, which depended on this money to balance budgets, had not wanted litigation to imperil the companies\u2019 ability to continue writing them checks. To health advocates, the MSA was \u201can utter failure for public health and a coup for the companies.\u201d\n\nToday, only 15 percent of Americans smoke, down from nearly 50 percent at mid-century; anti-smoking activists are estimated to have saved 8 million American lives over 50 years. Smokers are now poorer and less educated than nonsmokers; they have higher rates of cancer; and they are constantly told it is all their fault. \u201cFrom seed to smoke, the responsibility for tobacco production and consumption has been privatized and individualized.\u201d And the tobacco companies hardly even care that fewer Americans smoke. Smoking has gone overseas, and cigarette companies now derive most of their profits from international sales. Today, some 80 percent of smokers live in low- or middle-income countries. The toll of internationalizing the cigarette will be unthinkable. As the medical historian Allan Brandt has written, by century\u2019s end \u201cthe death toll is predicted to be one billion.\u201d\n\nThe Cigarette, while excellent, is far from the first book to document the harm wrought by Big Tobacco. For instance, Allan Brandt\u2019s brilliant The Cigarette Century recounted the cigarette companies\u2019 remarkable duplicity; Richard Kluger\u2019s magisterial Ashes to Ashes charted the tobacco wars with a novelist\u2019s flair. None of these scholars have written a true people\u2019s history of the cigarette\u2014exploring the human cost of this industry on farmers, smokers, and nonsmokers. But Milov has provided the premier account of the government\u2019s complicity with the exacting of this human cost, of the way Big Tobacco has evolved and adapted and neutralized lawmakers and regulators\u2014and thrived. And of a billion needlessly lost lives.\n\nThe lessons of her book remain stunningly relevant today. We\u2019re in the midst of revelations that the sugar industry similarly relied on advertising to distract consumers from its extreme addictiveness. In the NFL\u2019s fights with former football players dying of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, the League hired the same lawyers, consultants, and lobbyists that Big Tobacco used. Cellphone companies have worked tirelessly to obscure evidence of the connection between cellular radiation and all manner of negative health impacts. Even with mass shootings a daily occurrence, the gun industry has lobbied its way out of any meaningful oversight. Most noxious of all, fossil fuel companies have relied on shoddy science, constant PR, and the deliberate dissemination of doubt to cover up the connection between oil and gas and climate change\u2014a business decision that raised short-term profits but may have doomed our entire civilization.\n\nWill we learn from the history recounted in The Cigarette? As Milov\u2019s book so damningly shows, larger forces have long been quietly and insidiously shaping so much of daily life: privatization, brilliant advertising, the emergence of late capitalism. When we think about how to exact justice for the largest of crimes, we must turn our attention away from individual consumers and their choices and focus squarely on those that used their tremendous power to engineer entire economies for their own benefit.", "description": "A new book explores the tangled politics behind a global addiction.", "authors": ["Scott W.
