How dare you.\u201d\n\nMs Thunberg travelled to New York by boat to participate in the summit.\n\nDespite the gathering of delegates, several world leaders did not attend the meeting.\n\nDonald Trump was not expected to attend but the climate change sceptic arrived to listen to remarks from Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.\n\nMs Merkel made a series of detailed pledges, including going coal free. The president left without making a speech.\n\nScott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, where forest fires are raging in the Amazon, were notably absent from the gathering.\n\n\u201cYou are failing us. Young people are starting to understand your betrayal,\u201d Ms Thunberg told the summit\u2019s audience.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the US, climate activists trying to draw attention to the summit blocked traffic hubs at four locations in Washington DC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dire, it\u2019s dire, the house is on fire,\u201d protesters shouted in the US capital.\n\nCalls from young people for action were earlier projected onto the side of the UN headquarters in New York.\n\n\u201cEverything needs to change and it has to start today,\u201d read a message from Ms Thunberg, who has been credited with inspiring youth climate change protests.\n\nUnicef UK said the teenager was one of 16 children who had filed a landmark legal complaint to the UN Committee on Rights of the Child, about the failure of five countries to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nThe group has accused France, Germany, Brazil, Argentina and Turkey of ignoring climate science, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe committee will now have to judge whether the complaint is actionable or not.\n\n\u201cWe will not let you get away with this,\u201d Ms Thunberg said during her speech.\n\n\u201cRight here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nHer remarks won praise from prominent politicians and campaigners.\n\n\u201cThank you Greta Thunberg,\u201d said Chelsea Clinton on Twitter.\n\nMark Takano, a Democratic congressman, said he found the teenager\u2019s remarks inspiring.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly inspired by your activism, persistence, and passion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cClimate change is the greatest threat and fight of your generation. I will stand with all of you every step of the way.\u201d\n\nMany leaders at the summit pledged to do more to cut carbon emissions.\n\nAntonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, told the assembled crowd that it was not time to negotiate but instead time to act so that the world was carbon neutral by 2050.\n\n\u201cTime is running out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is not too late.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Greta Thunberg has told world leaders\u00a0they have stolen her\u00a0\u201ddreams and ... childhood with your empty words\u201d.
