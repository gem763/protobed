Don\u2019t make Indian democracy a laughing stock", "language": "en", "text": "High-profile celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s leadership of India\u2019s freedom struggle are rendered meaningless by repetitive and frivolous invocation of heavy-handed colonial-era laws, such as those pertaining to sedition, 72 years after independence. This was yet again demonstrated when a letter to the PM voicing concern over the spate of lynchings and hate crime, written by a group of the country\u2019s leading thinkers and artists, drew charges of sedition and breach of peace. While the Supreme Court has tried to limit the meaning of sedition to a direct and immediate incitement to violence akin to a \u201cspark in a powder keg\u201d, in practice it has been applied to even the most commonplace raising of questions by Indian citizens.\n\nDemocratic expression of views must be permitted and laws incompatible with such a basic right, such as the one on sedition, must be consigned to where they belong \u2013 the trash can of history. As writer Amit Chaudhuri, one of the signatories to the letter, has noted, there has been no formal announcement yet that fundamental rights are suspended and Indian democracy has ceased to exist. It\u2019s incomprehensible, therefore, where such complaints and FIRs are coming out of and from what understanding of law and constitutional rights Surya Kant Tiwari, chief judicial magistrate at a Muzaffarpur court, chose to admit the charge against the letter writers.\n\nOne amidst the bizarre farrago of charges is that the signatories have \u201ctarnished the image of the country.\u201d India gains a lot of mileage and prestige by calling itself the world\u2019s biggest democracy. That is how, for instance, it distinguishes itself from Pakistan \u2013 which it is trying hard to isolate in the international arena. If, however, a democratic expression of views leads to charges of sedition and breach of peace, then Indian democracy will be the world\u2019s laughing stock. Nothing could tarnish the country\u2019s image more, and it would have succeeded in re-hyphenating itself with Pakistan.\n\nThe government must clarify where it stands on the issue. Higher judiciary must take suo motu cognisance of this lower court order, and move quickly to quash it. And the Supreme Court must open a full re-examination of the constitutionality of the sedition law, taking into account its recent history of misuse.", "description": "High-profile celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s leadership of India\u2019s freedom struggle are rendered meaningless by repetitive and frivolous invocation of heavy-handed colonial-era laws, such as those pertaining to sedition, 72 years after independence.
