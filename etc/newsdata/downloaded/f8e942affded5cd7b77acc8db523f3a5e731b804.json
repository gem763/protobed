Now Stop Pretending Canada Is a Diverse Paradise.", "language": "en", "text": "And none made a concrete pledge to counter virulently prejudicial legislation in Quebec, which bans the wearing of religious symbols in the public workplace, fomenting Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. The resurgent Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois slyly tucked it away during the campaign.\n\nNot everyone avoided the realities of being black, brown, Indigenous or another minority group in Canada. We were talking, tweeting, publishing and protesting. But people with bigger platforms \u2014 our politicians and the national media \u2014 haven\u2019t kept the conversation going for more than five minutes. Combine niceness with newsrooms that are disproportionately white, and coverage inevitably distorts in ways that don\u2019t adequately represent the country\u2019s racial and ethnic diversity.\n\nJust days before the election, the Canadian media largely glossed over another opportunity for debate on race: when Barack Obama, the first black president of the United States, gave his endorsement to Mr. Trudeau, the first (known) prime minister to wear blackface. The Globe and Mail positioned it as an \u201cunjustifiable American intrusion\u201d; the Canadian Broadcasting C orporation orated on the men\u2019s cozy relationship; the National Post buried it in a roundup of the day\u2019s campaign news; and Global News weirdly noted only that President Trump was reluctant to talk about Canada\u2019s blackface scandal.\n\nAlso striking was the tone of coverage about the overt racism directed toward Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party, who is Sikh. Mr. Singh was repeatedly lauded for his \u201cpoise\u201d and \u201cgrace\u201d across reporting after a man demanded the leader \u201ccut off\u201d his turban \u201cto look like a Canadian\u201d when they crossed paths at a Montreal campaign event. And then, during the English-language debate, it was exploited as a talking point by rival candidates, who awkwardly took turns congratulating him over his handling of the episode.\n\nAnd still, there was no scrutiny of the actual racism. It seems that many Canadians just don\u2019t want to grapple with race head on. Even the progressive-minded Elizabeth May, who leads the Green Party and is frank about systemic racism, says she\u2019s \u201chesitant\u201d to speak out when asked if Canada is \u201cracist as a country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a hard answer because it makes people uncomfortable,\u201d she told reporters earlier this month.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get over being nice and comfortable. It\u2019s time to acknowledge that Canada\u2019s race issues impact everyone, and to work toward understanding and validating the experiences of racialized Canadians.\n\nMr. Trudeau loves to say that \u201cdiversity is Canada\u2019s strength.\u201d Diversity is also tough, challenging and sometimes outright frustrating because it requires listening, being open to what you don\u2019t know, and letting go of what you think you do. At the same time, diversity is just the myth; anti-racism is the work. For starters, the Liberals should prep up their new Anti-Racism Strategy so it can be used immediately to launch a national conversation. No one should know better than Mr. Trudeau that this work is needed now, and must not get papered over until the next appalling episode.", "description": "It\u2019s time to get over being nice and comfortable.", "authors": ["Cheryl Thompson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/opinion/23thompson1/23thompson1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
