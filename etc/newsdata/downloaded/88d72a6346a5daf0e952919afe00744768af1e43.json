They are now so cocky they are stealing in blind sight because there\u2019s no police. They still haven\u2019t been caught.\u201d\n\nDad of two James Collins, 49, who lives in the Hatfield Estate area, said: \u201cPriti\u2019s constituents should be her responsibility, yet she\u2019s neglecting them. I\u2019ve reported crime\n\nfrequently. It\u2019s fuelled by drugs. One lady who worked at a shop was beaten up and has now had to move out of Witham.\u201d\n\nSpeaking outside the block of flats, where there\u2019s a sofa on the lawn, he added: \u201cI never see the police and we have a community support officer I\u2019ve seen twice.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Clarke)\n\nOur probe revealed that in the district of Braintree, which as a policing area covers part of Ms Patel\u2019s patch, crimes including possession of weapons, violence with injury and street robbery and muggings have shot up.\n\nOffice for National Statistics for the district show in the year to March 2010 there were 598 cases of violence with injury, compared with 965 in the year up to March this year \u2013 an increase of over 60 per cent. Street robberies surged from 35 to 70 over the same period.\n\nPolice in Essex have also been cut by 15 per cent since 2010 \u2013 meaning 535 fewer officers. Witham\u2019s police station closed three years ago as part of a \u00a363million cash-saving scheme.\n\nHairdresser Kellie Holman told of how salon Yaxley Hair and Beauty was targeted by a drunken yob who booted the window in front of shocked customers.\n\n(Image: Tim Clarke)\n\nThe 49-year-old said: \u201cNothing like this has happened before. Crime has got worse, especially since the station shut. There are fewer and fewer officers.\u201d\n\nLocals claim there has been a spate of break-ins. At a convenience store, an employee said: \u201cMy neighbour was broken into in the middle of the day. But luckily she was in. They\u2019ve now had to install cameras.\u201d\n\nA worker at Newlands Shopping Centre, in Witham town centre, said: \u201cPeople are getting beaten up. And we just go about our normal business, that\u2019s how it is round here.\u201d\n\nIn July, a man and two women were found with stab wounds on a street. And earlier this month a transgender teen had his face cut in an attack police are treating as a hate crime.\n\n(Image: Tim Clarke)\n\nLast year, officers were called to restaurant Little India in Witham after a fight broke out between up to 40 people \u2013 some of them brandishing weapons including a machete. Seconds after we arrived on the town\u2019s high street, a dealer offered us cannabis.\n\nDrug users were puffing away without a care in front of boarded-up shops. Pavements were covered with shattered glass.\n\nLast weekend Ms Patel, 47, told of her plan to combat street violence by ending soft sentences and giving police more protection. As she made her vow, she told how she had been targeted on her own doorstep before she was MP for Witham.\n\nShe told how a drug-crazed thug hanging around her home pulled a blade on her as she tried to get to her front door.\n\nShe said she had been \u201creally upset\u201d, adding: \u201cViolent crime concerns us all. It invades communities and homes. It can break neighbourhoods and it has such a long-standing, chilling impact.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Clarke)\n\nBut Eileen Davidson MBE, chair of the Witham Labour branch, called her a \u201chypocrite\u201d. She said: \u201cShe slates the police for their lack of action at the same time as voting for all the cuts.\n\n\u201cShe has encouraged private policing with parish councils encouraged to pay for special constables. The cuts have meant the PCSOs have disappeared.\n\n\u201cAll that knowledge has gone, there\u2019s nothing to combat that sort of crime. Priti is a hypocrite. She talks the talk and fails to walk the walk.\u201d\n\nHer views were echoed by teacher Chris Vince, who stood as Labour\u2019s candidate for Essex\u2019s Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner in 2016 but lost to Tory Roger Hirst.\n\n(Image: Tim Clarke)\n\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost hundreds of officers since 2011. It\u2019s such a hypocritical thing to talk about when you have been part of a government which for nine years has overseen massive cuts. Cuts have consequences. I\u2019ve seen the amount of pressure police are under.\u201d\n\nEssex Police said: \u201cRecorded crime in England and Wales is, on average, about 30 per cent higher than in Braintree.\n\n\u201cThe number of violence with injury offences remains much lower than the national average and reduced in the 12 months to August, while robbery rates are three times higher nationally.\n\nThere has been a rise in the number of possession of weapons recorded and this represents positive, proactive police work.\n\n(Image: Tim Clarke)\n\n\u201cCrime is increasing across the country and Essex is no different.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office said: \u201cThe Home Secretary\u2019s first priority is to tackle crime both in Witham and across the country.\n\nEssex Police is receiving almost \u00a3300million in 2019/20, including council tax, a \u00a323million increase on the previous financial year.\n\nThe Government has also started recruiting 20,000 additional police officers, as well as backing them to do their jobs by making it easier for them to use stop and search powers.\n\n\u201cJust this week, the Home Secretary \u00adannounced further \u00admeasures so that the police have the powers and tools they need to keep us safe, including equipping more officers with Tasers and a \u00a320million package to roll up county lines drugs gangs.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Sunday People can reveal cases have surged by over 60 per cent in the heart of the Home Secretary\u2019s patch since under Tory rule", "authors": ["Scarlet Howes", "Image", "Tim Clarke", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20468871.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Priti-Patel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
