The 8TT Class 8 electric trucks will be based at four Anheuser-Busch distribution facilities in Sylmar, Riverside, Pomona and Carson.\n\nAnheuser-Busch is also working with energy infrastructure company ENGIE Services to install charging equipment and a 958.5 kW solar array that the companies said will generate zero-emissions power to offset the use of energy to charge the trucks.\n\nThe companies expect Anheuser-Busch\u2019s new BYD trucks will start hitting the road by the end of the year and the project will be completed in 2021.\n\nAngie Slaughter, Anheuser-Busch\u2019s president of sustainability procurement, said the company is working to reduce carbon emissions by 25 percent by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe transport industry is one that is prime for innovative solutions and we are excited to continue driving progress towards a zero-emission fleet through this partnership,\u201d Slaughter said.\n\nFord and General Motors both reported increases in traditional van sales Wednesday, but the brewer isn\u2019t the only business moving toward electric vehicles. Amazon officials said last month that they had ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian Automotive, a company that both Amazon and Ford have invested in. And UPS has shared plans to buy electric vehicles from Workhorse, the Ohio-based manufacturer that has been in talks to buy a shuttered GM plant there.\n\nBYD says it\u2019s the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world. While it only has about 1,000 employees in North America, the company employs 220,000 people worldwide. Its largest shareholder is Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBefore inking the deal, Anheuser-Busch put BYD\u2019s trucks through testing and got \u201centhusiastic feedback from drivers,\u201d the companies said. John Gerra, BYD\u2019s director of business development for electric trucks, said the company\u2019s vehicles \u201cout are there right now working hard every day throughout California.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re honored to be part of this major milestone demonstrating the operation, economic and environmental sustainability benefits of our zero-emission trucks,\u201d Gerra said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFOX Business' Jonathan Garber contributed to this report.", "description": "Anheuser-Busch is also planning a solar array to offset energy used to charge the trucks.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/featured.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
