Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSvitolina will go it alone into the last four at Flushing Meadows but boyfriend Monfils will be cheering from the players box on Thursday when she faces local favourite Serena Williams, who is chasing a record equalling 24th career Grand Slam title.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be definitely a tough match for her,\u201d said Monfils. \u201cShe has nothing to lose. She knows Serena well. She knows the crowd is going to be against her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tricky one at the beginning, I would say, for both.\n\n\u201cI think it is important for Serena to come out fast because if she should come in slow, I think Elina will be there.\u201d\n\nUntil Monfils\u2019s 3-6 6-3 6-2 3-6 7-6(5) quarter-final loss to Matteo Berrettini, the charismatic Frenchman and Svitolina had been putting a new spin on the Grand Slam love story penned when Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf won the French Open titles in 1999, although at the time their burgeoning relationship was a secret.\n\nSvitolina and Monfils have been together for over a year but their romance has captivated even the most jaded New Yorkers during the U.S. Open.\n\nWhile they have not shouted their devotion from the top of the Empire State building neither have they tried to hide it and they routinely post photos on social media, including an Instagram account they share.\n\nIn contrast Agassi and Graf went to extremes to keep their relationship secret with the German watching Agassi from the bleachers at the U.S. Open so as not to spark rumours.\n\nWhile Monfils\u2019 and Svitolina\u2019s relationship has blossomed, so have their respective games.\n\nSvitolina, who trains with Monfils, has now made it to the semi-finals of the last two Grand Slams and credits the Frenchman for improving her ability to handle big shots and bigger expectations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s hitting pretty strong and very heavy,\u201d said the fifth seeded Ukrainian. \u201cSo I think definitely it helps me to practice with him.\n\n\u201cI think hitting with him it\u2019s definitely helped me to improve my reaction and my footwork.\n\n\u201cI think I am more calm, if you want to describe it in few words.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more open with my coach and also with Gael about the tennis and my feeling.\u201d", "description": "When it comes to tennis it seems love does not conquer all as Gael Monfils discovered on Wednesday when he failed to follow girlfriend Elina Svitolina into the semi-finals of the U.S. Open.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426356347&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8402W"}
