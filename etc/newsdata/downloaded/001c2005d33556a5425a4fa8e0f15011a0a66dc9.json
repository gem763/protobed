But on April 23, 2018, she did the unthinkable.\n\nOn that day, Jennair Gerardot broke into the home of the woman with whom he was having an affair, Meredith Chapman, and shot and killed her before killing herself.\n\n\u201cI had to know myself \u2014 how she pulled this off, why she did what she did,\u201d Mark Gerardot told \u201c20/20.\u201d\n\nThe scope of the surveillance and planning he uncovered was far more than he could have ever imagined.\n\nMark and Jennair Gerardot found young love in each other, dating through college and getting married in 1993. In 2017, they were living in South Carolina together.\n\nCourtesy of Mark Gerardot\n\nMark left South Carolina and met Chapman while interviewing for a position in the University of Delaware\u2019s marketing department. He later accepted the job offer and the two soon began having an affair shortly after he began working there, while Jennair Gerardot remained in South Carolina to lease the couple\u2019s home.\n\nWhen she moved to be with her husband in December 2017, she could immediately sense that Mark Gerardot was distant, he said, and she suspected there might be another woman.\n\n\u201cShe finally asked me, \u2018What's up with you? You\u2019re acting different,\u2019\u201d Mark Gerardot said. \u201cShe said specifically, \u2018It\u2019s Meredith, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough Mark Gerardot would deny the affair at first, his wife continued questioning his relationship with Chapman. Jennair Gerardot would also keep tabs on him and Chapman, he said, and she would know things about them for which he couldn\u2019t understand how.\n\nUniversity of Delaware\n\nThe questioning came to a head around Valentine\u2019s Day 2018. She revealed she had hired a company to gain access to his phone and that it allowed her to read his texts and see his photos and records of all calls he had with Chapman. Mark Gerardot finally admitted to his wife that he had been cheating on her with Chapman.\n\nFollowing these admissions, the two agreed to go to marriage counseling. However, on the day of their second session, Mark Gerardot was putting his jacket on when he felt something in the lining of his pocket.\n\nHe cut it open and found a recording device had been planted inside by being sewn in. Its flashing light indicated that it was recording him at that very moment.\n\n\u201cShe told me she wanted to understand the degree to which Meredith and I were in the relationship,\u201d Mark Gerardot said. \u201cShe was determined there was a plan between Meredith and I, and she was trying to listen to what that plan was.\u201d In counseling, she agreed to stop planting any recording devices.\n\nPlay\n\nHowever, their relationship rapidly began to move toward divorce. Meanwhile, Chapman and her husband were in the process of divorcing her husband, and Chapman had just accepted a new position at Villanova University in the wealthy Main Line region of suburban Philadelphia, and moved into a new home nearby.\n\nJennair Gerardot began to see a divorce coach while Mark agreed to his wife's requests, including going on hikes and having dinner together, in the coming weeks until he officially moved out.\n\n\u201cIt was odd, but I\u2019m trying to land this thing so she\u2019s in a good place,\u201d Mark Gerardot said. \u201cIf this was what she needed, then I was going to do that.\u201d\n\nMark Gerardot said that although his wife would occasionally break down, for the most part she was \u201cacting normal\u201d. In secret, however, she had been planning revenge.\n\nOn the evening of April 23, 2018, Mark Gerardot was supposed to meet his wife for dinner so that they could discuss divorce arrangements. But in a series of text messages, Jennair Gerardot told her husband that she would be late and then that she wouldn\u2019t be making it. She then sent more messages.\n\n\u201cYou ruined my life,\u201d she said in one message, according to Mark Gerardot, who said that the next two read, \u201cI hope you never find happiness\u201d and \u201cBye, Mark.\u201d\n\nPlay\n\nBelieving that Jennair Gerardot and Chapman had been in a confrontation, Mark Gerardot began rushing to Chapman\u2019s home. He had already been trying to reach her, but his text messages went unanswered.\n\nWhen he arrived, he found Chapman lying face down on her kitchen floor with a pool of blood forming around her head. His wife was also dead nearby, dressed all in black, lying on the floor.\n\nGerardot was shattered. \u201cMy world was gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt like\u2026 suspended reality. It just wasn't real.\u201d\n\nRead on to see some of what Mark Gerardot uncovered indicating his wife\u2019s weeks-long plot for violence, and watch the full story on ABC News\u2019 \u201c20/20\u201d FRIDAY at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nAfter his wife\u2019s death, Mark Gerardot started poring through her bank statements, phone records and a computer backup in search of answers. The recording device that he discovered in his jacket, he found out, was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nRecording devices\n\n\u201cShe had planted recording devices in his office,\u201d Dr. Janice Harper, a writing coach working with Geradot on a book, said.\n\nMark Gerardot says he realized his wife had methodically implanted listening devices in many of his clothes and had a daily routine of logging his conversations.\n\n\u201cEvery day she would take it back out and then sew it back in, download it,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe had done that for weeks.\u201d\n\nMark Gerardot says he found that she transcribed \u201cevery word of it\u201d in a total of 12 notebooks.\n\nPlay\n\nReceipts for surveillance equipment\n\nJennair Gerardot also opened a bank account and secret credit cards days after Mark Gerardot admitted to the affair, he said. She used the credit cards to purchase equipment for her elaborate surveillance.\n\nIn credit card statements, he says he also discovered transactions for a lock-picking kit he believes she used to break into his office, computer hacking software, DNA testing for his clothes and a sophisticated GPS tracking system she personally installed on both his and Chapman\u2019s cars.\n\nGPS trackers\n\n\u201cOn the actual GPS maps, there were two icons, one showing my car and one showing Meredith's car,\u201d he said. \u201cShe named my device 'lying jerk,\u2019 and she called Meredith's device 'whore.\u2019\u201d\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nMark Gerardot\u2019s private chats\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Mark Gerardot says he also found over 400 images of private conversations between him and Chapman on Snapchat.\n\n\u201cMy best guess as to how she gained access to my phone was in the middle of the night \u2014 I was sleeping on the couch [and] she put my thumb on the reader,\u201d he said.\n\nGun purchase and gun box\n\nIt became clear that while Jennair Gerardot had been seeing a divorce coach, she had also secretly purchased the murder weapon.\n\nMark Gerardot discovered the receipt showing she had bought the gun close to five weeks before she used it. He also found the box for the gun.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there\u2019s a gun in the closet that I didn\u2019t know existed\u2026it\u2019s unbelievable to think we were headed towards what I hoped out be a civil end,\u201d he said.\n\nHer divorce coach Sheila Brennan said she appeared to be thinking about the future, speaking about where she would move to and where she would work.\n\nHowever in hindsight, Brennan says, \u201cIt was literally like two different people. It was the person who was planning the future and then it was the person who was planning for the end\u2026 She totally had different plans that had nothing to do with divorce. That part is shocking.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nEvidence Jennair Gerardot practiced before murder-suicide\n\nReceipts reveal she went to a firing range three times before the murder.\n\n\u201cThe last time she went was just hours before she took Meredith\u2019s life and then her own,\u201d Mark Gerardot said.\n\nCross-referencing records and calendars, he believes he spoke to Jennair while she was at the shooting range.\n\nOn an audio recording from his car, his wife is heard claiming she was wrapping up and going home \u201cto do taxes\u201d on the day she first visited the firing range.\n\n\u201cIt's chilling to hear her act that normal and standing in a gun store,\u201d he said.\n\nChilling letter from Jennair Gerardot\n\nJennair Gerardot also left behind a revealing letter to her family she had begun writing weeks before the crime, laying out her private thoughts and plans.\n\n\u201cThey cannot get away with destroying my life for their gain,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy life and soul are irrevocably broken. I am not even a shell of the person I once was.\u201d\n\nMark says he regrets \u201cbreaking her heart and making her feel like she had no other choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could have stopped the relationship\u2026 handled it completely differently,\u201d he said.", "description": "In 2018, Jennair Gerardot broke into the home of the woman her husband was having an affair with, then shot and killed her before killing herself.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/mark-with-evidence-abc-ay-190905_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
