(When was the last time you or anyone you know said, \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about my side table!\u201d) But, in its own quiet way, a side table can really set the tone of a room, as it dutifully holds a lamp, remote control, snake plant, or Amy\u2019s pesto-tortellini bowl. A bright-yellow one is a nice way to introduce some color without going full-on Sesame Street; a Lucite one is a nice way to add a minimalist \u201980s vibe without going full-on Wall Street. We did the work of finding the right one for you by rounding up cheap (under $200), but expensive-looking, side tables (some of which are actually stools, but do the same job), all of which are available on Amazon.\n\nColorful Side Tables\n\nAcrylic Side Tables\n\nBrass Side Tables\n\nWood Side Tables\n\nWhite Side Tables\n\nPet Side Tables\n\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
