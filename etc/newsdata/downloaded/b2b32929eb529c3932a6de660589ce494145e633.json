Although his work has been done in the background, Bobat also sat on the interview panel when Smith pipped Andy Flower to the selector\u2019s job and has sat in on selection meetings for the past couple of years.\n\nEngland\u2019s managing director of cricket Ashley Giles said: \u2018The position of performance director is critical in the development of our long-term strategy for elite performance. Mo demonstrated through his knowledge and experience that he has the attributes to take us forward in this area.\n\n\u2018He will be responsible for identifying our highest-potential players and leading programmes that will bridge the gap between county and international cricket, helping us to deliver successful, respected and inspiring England players and teams.\n\n\u2018The performance director will work closely with the counties to enhance the size and quality of our talent pool and ensure we\u2019re jointly making decisions in each player\u2019s best long-term interests.\n\n\u2018We have to develop a long-term strategy that identifies the best players in the country that can step up and excel in the international arena. We will expose them to learn and perform in all conditions around the world.\u2019\n\nBobat has brought ideas from the Premier League and American sports to the task of identifying talent.", "description": "Bond was employed in the role for the first two Tests of the 2017-18 Ashes before Chris Silverwood became England's fast-bowling coach, and could be asked to fill in on an interim basis.", "authors": ["Richard Gibson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/20/19508604-0-image-a-5_1570650612399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
