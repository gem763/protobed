As part of the investigation, Facebook reviewed \"all of the apps that had access to large amounts of information.\"\n\nSo far in the investigation, Facebook has banned \"tens of thousands\" of apps for reasons including \"inappropriately sharing data obtained from us, making data publicly available without protecting people's identity or something else that was in clear violation of our policies.\" Facebook said these suspended apps came from only about 400 developers.\n\nThe \"tens of thousands\" number is a huge step-up from Facebook's previously reported numbers of suspended apps: 200 in May 2018, then 400 apps in August 2018. Facebook says the review of its apps is \"by no means finished.\"\n\nRead more: Facebook understood how dangerous the Trump-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica could be much earlier than it previously said. Here's everything that's happened up until now.\n\nFacebook's handling and use of data has been under intense scrutiny since the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Most recently, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion for its role in the incident, which the regulator said violated a past agreement that the company wouldn't hand over user data to third parties without consent.\n\nRecent news reports, based off of copies of internal documents, apparently show that Facebook was first made aware of a \"potential data violation\" in September 2015 but that the company didn't publicly address the matter until March 2018.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has also alleged that Facebook failed to disclose the breach for more than two years and that the company instead relied on hypotheticals to tell investors that users data \"may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\"", "description": "The company launched a full-fledged investigation into apps on the Facebook platform in March 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8509022e22af5c5a352350-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
