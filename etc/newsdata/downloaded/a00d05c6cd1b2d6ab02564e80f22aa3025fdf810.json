FirstNet is a national communication platform that is dedicated to first responders.\n\nAT&T expects the deal to close in the next nine months subject to review by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe company\u2019s business in Puerto Rico comprises internet, TV, landlines and business services.\n\nAT&T also said shareholders should expect buybacks in the fourth quarter as it aims at balancing its debt and profit.", "description": "AT&T Inc said on Wednesday it would sell its wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands to Liberty Latin America Ltd for $1.95 billion, as the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier cuts its huge debt pile.", "authors": ["Neha Malara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438841147&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9817M", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
