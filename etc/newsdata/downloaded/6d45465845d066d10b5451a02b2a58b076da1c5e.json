They pack an earthy, oniony punch in these dal and chutney recipes\n\nThere are a handful of ingredients that I use on repeat to boost flavour. They have become like reliable old friends: from lemons to smoked paprika, my kitchen is never without them. One less run-of-the-mill kitchen friend is nigella seeds, or kalonji. Their flavour is quite difficult to describe \u2013 perhaps closest to the faintest taste of onion, but with a back note of earthy spice.\n\nThis dal and chutney put the flavour of nigella seeds centre stage, but be bold and use the seeds to perk up simple everyday dishes, too, like fried eggs on toast, rice or baked feta.\n\nNigella seed and lime dal (main picture above)\n\nI suggest soaking the lentils overnight, to help reduce the cooking time and to make them easier to digest. If you can\u2019t manage this, a couple of hours will do.\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nSoak Overnight\n\nCook 1 hr\n\nServes 4\n\n100g red (split) lentils\n\n100g chana dal (split yellow lentils)\n\n2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped\n\n1 thumb-size piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped\n\n1 green chilli, finely chopped (deseeded if you like)\n\n1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped\n\n1 tsp cumin seeds\n\n1 tsp coriander seeds\n\n1 \u00d7 400ml tin coconut milk\n\n500ml hot vegetable stock\n\n1 bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped, stalks and all\n\n1 lime, juiced\n\nFor the nigella seed temper\n\n1 tsp mustard seeds\n\n2 tbsp nigella seeds\n\n2 tbsp ghee\n\nTo serve\n\nPlain yoghurt\n\nPlum chutney (see above recipe)\n\nChapatis/roti (optional)\n\nBrown basmati rice (optional)\n\nRinse the red lentils, then soak with the dal in cold water, ideally overnight, or for as long as you have \u2013 at least two hours.\n\nIn a large saucepan, fry the garlic, ginger, chilli and red onion in a little oil for about 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Add the seeds, and cook for a couple of minutes to toast and release their flavours.\n\nDrain the lentils and rinse again, then add them to the pan with the coconut milk and stock. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down and let them bubble away for 40 minutes.\n\nNext, make the temper. Put a small frying pan on a high heat, fry the mustard and nigella seeds in a little ghee for two minutes, then pour into the dal and stir.\n\nTo finish, remove from the heat and stir in half the chopped coriander and lime juice. Pile into bowls and top with a dollop of yoghurt and spoonfuls of plum chutney. Serve with charred chapatis or roti \u2013 or, if you\u2019re really hungry, some brown basmati rice, too.\n\nPlum and nigella seed chutney\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anna Jones\u2019 plum and nigella seed chutney.\n\nThis is perfect alongside a curry or in a cheese sandwich.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 15 min\n\nServes 4\n\n1 tsp cumin seeds\n\n4 red plums, stoned and roughly chopped\n\n2 tsp sugar or runny honey\n\n1 tsp nigella seeds\n\n2 tsp grated ginger\n\nA splash of red-wine vinegar\n\n\u00bd lime, juiced and zested\n\nToast the cumin in a small saucepan until fragrant, then add all the other ingredients, saving a sprinkle of the nigella seeds for the end. Cook on a medium heat for about 10 minutes, until the plums begin to break down.\n\nLeave to cool, then, if you are eating right away, put in a serving bowl and sprinkle over the remaining nigella seeds. To keep for another day, put the chutney in a sterilised jar and store in the fridge.", "description": "Mix things up and make nigella seeds a new store-cupboard go-to.
