The last few years have been extremely difficult,\" Murray, who broke down in tears at the end, told Amazon Prime.\n\n\"Both me and Stan have had a lot of injury problems in the last couple of years. It's amazing to be back, playing against him in the final like that. I think it was a great match.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect to be in this position at all.
