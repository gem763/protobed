Syria \u2018today or tomorrow\u2019 as setting up safe zone with US became \u2018fairytale\u2019 \u2013 Erdogan\n\nThe military outpost near Tel Arqam is occupied by US-led coalition forces, who intervened in the conflict in breach of Syria\u2019s sovereignty more than five years ago, on the pretext of battling the Islamic State terrorist group. Supplying Kurdish militias with arms and using them as their boots on the ground (after years of supporting \u2018moderate rebels\u2019 flopped and turned out a PR disaster), Washington managed to maintain a foothold in the north of Syria.\n\nSyrian Kurds wish to maintain their autonomy, and Damascus does not mind this at all, as long as the country\u2019s territorial integrity is preserved. Ankara, however, fears that under Washington\u2019s guidance they might eventually secede, breaking away with a part of Turkey too, to establish an independent Kurdish state.\n\nAnkara and Washington agreed earlier in August to create a \u2018peace corridor\u2019 to facilitate the return of displaced Syrians into northern Syria \u2013 until Turkey realized that joint \u201cland and air patrols with [the] US were a fairytale.\u201d Turkish President Erdogan even openly suggested that Washington was only seeking to protect their Kurdish \u201cterrorist group,\u201d and announced that Turkey was all set and ready to go in alone to establish the so-called \u201csafe zone.\u201d\n\nIf anyone bothered to ask, Damascus would probably call both occupations illegal, as it has repeatedly blasted all joint and unilateral endeavors by the US and Turkey as flagrant violations of Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nAlso on rt.com Turkish troops & armored vehicles amass at Syrian border after Erdogan announces IMMINENT incursion (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)\n\nLike this story?
