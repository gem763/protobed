I thought the Americans were supposed to be friendly with the British but I saw no evidence of it.\n\n\"The detention centre was freezing cold and the food was disgusting. The only thing I could eat was tuna.\n\n\"My baby got a cold in there and I wasn't even allowed to give him teething salt because the sachets were confiscated.\n\n\"We weren't allowed to smoke for two weeks either or have fizzy drinks.\n\n\"My hands are trembling, I've been a nervous wreck but we're back now where we belong - with friends and family.\n\n\"But I'm glad I'm out of the place, it was absolutely awful. So run down.\"\n\nShe said her biggest regret was that the family had been banned from visiting the US for the next five years and she had wanted to take her children to Disneyland.\n\n\"We have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights and lied to.\"\n\nIn a statement to the PA news agency on Wednesday, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said its evidence contradicted that of the Connors family.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"A vehicle was observed via remote video surveillance system turning west onto Avenue 0 in British Columbia, Canada, at approximately 9pm, October 2.\n\n\"The vehicle then turned south and entered the US illegally, by slowly and deliberately driving through a ditch onto Boundary Road in Blaine, Washington.\n\n\"The vehicle travelled west on Boundary Road continuing on the United States side, and was pulled over by a Border Patrol agent a short time later.\"\n\nThe statement said the family members were arrested minutes later on suspicion of illegally entering the United States without inspection.\n\nAttempts were made to return the individuals to Canada, however Canada refused to allow their return and two attempts to contact the United Kingdom consulate were unsuccessful, the CBP said.\n\nThe CBP added two adult family members were previously denied travel authorisation to come to the United States.", "description": "A British\u00a0family\u00a0detained in an American immigration facility after crossing the\u00a0US\u00a0border have been sent back to the UK,\u00a0US\u00a0officials have confirmed.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Xuf5JcK8N9rAGcrF91MOzg--~B/aD00Njk7dz03NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/321c47e24f0f721244deffa414388f19", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
