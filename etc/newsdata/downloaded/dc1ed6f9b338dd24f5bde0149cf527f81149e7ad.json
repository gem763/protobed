Over 7,000 reports have been lodged on popular crowdsourcing outage site Down Detector, with a map on the service painting a grim picture for Three Network staff.\n\nMany took to Twitter to lambaste Three for not only its shoddy service but its inadequate response to the network crisis overnight.\n\nOk @ThreeUKSupport, this is getting ridiculous now. Your network has been down for around 6hrs with absolutely no explanation or even an apology from you! We know you have CS that work 24hrs so why the lack of information? Just tell us what is going on! #ThreeDown#NoInfo \u2014 Dan (@dlever21) October 17, 2019\n\nWell @ThreeUK@ThreeUKSupport went down for almost 8 hours. But my internet speeds are now 10 times faster.
