Having started with a one-shot advantage in Rome, Fitzpatrick, 25, found himself three behind by the 10th and at a loss to explain what was going wrong.\n\n\u201cI was one-over for the day but didn\u2019t think I was swinging it badly at all,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cI mentioned as much to Billy [Foster, his caddie] and he told me just to stay patient. That put me back on track and to finish the way I did was great.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the four birdies in the last six holes for a 68 and a 15-under total were significant but so, too were the par saves at the 11th and 12th. Fitzpatrick has been around for so long that sometimes it is easy to forget how relatively young he is, but there has been a definite maturing in the past months.", "description": "Matt Fitzpatrick will on Sunday attempt to go where even illustrious countrymen such as Sir Nick Faldo, Lee Westwood and Justin Rose failed, by becoming the first Englishman to win six European Tour titles before his 26th birthday.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000104687056-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_4lZL6XGyKd1IzVfh-3zqkpkeFC-jy54sE4fIToyDxs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
