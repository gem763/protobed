The randomness of the news flow has made trading nearly impossible, but it is becoming even more difficult as the headlines aren't even accurate.\n\nOvernight it was reported by the South China Morning Post that no progress had been made on a deal and that the Chinese delegation was leaving early. Futures dropped sharply on that headline, but it then was reported that the White House was denying that report. Bloomberg reported that a deal on currency in exchange for a delay in tariffs was being considered and there were also reports of some accommodations for suppliers to Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe news flow is constant and can't be trusted and is a good example of the old adage, \"The market hates uncertainty.\" The problem with all this uncertainty is that it does not allow the market to discount or price in the news. If there clearly is no deal then market participants could react accordingly and price in the impact. Some stocks that already have corrected substantially might even rally while others would need to calculate the impact of tariffs and other issues.\n\nAt present it looks like the trade situation is pretty much the same as it was before the last 24 hours of news. There are negotiations taking place and it is not expected that there will be a major deal. There is hope that there will be some smaller deals on various issues that will keep tariffs on hold or even cut them to some extent.\n\nAs I discussed on Wednesday my view is that there will be some small deal that the market will briefly celebrate but that it will set up a \"sell the news\" reaction due to the continued uncertainty about all the other trade issues that are still up in the air. Hopefully, this will allow the market to find some decent technical support and allow for more logical trading into third-quarter earnings reports.\n\nHowever, for the next two days we must continue to deal with the headline lottery. We don't know what will hit or when and positioning is mainly just a function of luck. While some traders believe that this random volatility makes for good traders, it undermines the efforts of speculators who are trying to make moves that aren't particularly risky.\n\nMy game plan is not to guess the headline that will hit next and its impact on the market but to stay patient and focus more on the reaction to actual news once it is announced. The best trading odds will develop after there is some clarity and market players look to price in the impact. Betting on the indices at this juncture is mostly just gambling rather than reasoned speculation.\n\nI'm optimistic that out of this mess of a market we eventually will see a great environment for stock picking, but we need to stay patient and wait for conditions to develop.\n\nWe have some minor downside to start the day here on Thursday, but the next trade headline will generate a strong reaction.
