As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nThe NFL didn't wait for Tuesday's trade deadline to take action.\n\nAhead of the league's cutoff for deals, several squads have already taken a bold approach in reshaping their rosters. The Los Angeles Rams set the tone two weeks ago by acquiring Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey, but there have been a flurry of other trades since then, with the likes of the New England Patriots, San Francisco 49ers, Houston Texans and Seattle Seahawks bolstering their rosters by adding key players.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports will be tracking all the action leading up to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET trade deadline, so check back here for all the latest buzz on deals.\n\nCompleted trades and latest news\n\n- Cleveland Browns trade LB/DE Genard Avery to Philadelphia Eagles for a 2021 fourth-round draft pick\n\n- New York Jets trade DE Leonard Williams to New York Giants for a 2020 third-round pick and 2021 fifth-round pick that can become a fourth-round pick\n\nANALYSIS: Jets made right move by trading Leonard Williams to Giants\n\n- Miami Dolphins trade RB Kenyan Drake to Arizona Cardinals for a 2020 sixth-round pick that can become a fifth-round pick\n\n- New England Patriots trade DE Michael Bennett to Dallas Cowboys for a 2021 seventh-round pick that could become a sixth-round pick\n\n- Detroit Lions trade S Quandre Diggs to Seattle Seahawks for 2020 fifth-round pick\n\n- Denver Broncos trade WR Emmanuel Sanders and 2020 fifth-round pick to San Francisco 49ers for 2020 third-round pick and 2020 fourth-round pick\n\n- Atlanta Falcons trade WR Mohamed Sanu to New England Patriots for 2020 second-round pick\n\n- Oakland Raiders trade CB Gareon Conley to Houston Texans for 2020 third-round draft pick\n\n- Jacksonville Jaguars trade CB Jalen Ramsey to Los Angeles Rams for 2020 first-round pick, 2021 first-round pick and 2021 fourth-round pick\n\n- Los Angeles Rams trade CB Marcus Peters to Baltimore Ravens for LB Kenny Young and 2020 fifth-round draft pick\n\nPlayers potentially on trading block\n\n- Falcons OLB Vic Beasley: Atlanta might have to eat some of what remains on Beasley's $12.8 million salary, and even then it could be difficult to find a taker for a player with an expiring contract and minimal production (1 1/2 sacks this season).\n\n- Rams CB Aqib Talib: Los Angeles already reshaped its secondary by bringing in Ramsey and sending off Peters, and ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the team is \"open\" to moving Talib to free up cap space.\n\n- Redskins LT Trent Williams: Washington has yet to flinch throughout the seven-time Pro Bowl selection's holdout, but NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Monday the team now would be open to a deal for the right price.\n\n- Lions CB Darius Slay: ESPN reported Detroit was fielding calls on the star of its secondary, who said he felt as though \"no one is safe\" after the team dealt Diggs to the Seahawks.

Howard: The MMQB's Albert Breer reported earlier in October that the Patriots inquired about Howard bur were shot down. ESPN's Jenna Laine reported the team would only send him away for a \"substantial\" return.\n\n- Broncos CB Chris Harris Jr.: Even after Denver sent Sanders to the 49ers, Harris maintained last week he didn't expect to be traded this season, though he could be an attractive option for cornerback-needy teams.\n\n- Jets WR Robby Anderson: After Gang Green parted with Leonard Williams, the team could also move on from the speedy Anderson, who is set to become a free agent.\n\n- Dolphins WR DeVante Parker: Miami has already sold off many of its veterans for draft capital, and Parker could be the next in line.\n\n- 49ers QB C.J. Beathard: NBC Sports Bay Area's Matt Maiocco reported San Francisco has received offers in the \"sixth-round range\" for the third-string passer.\n\nTeams that could be active\n\n- Eagles: GM Howie Roseman might not be done tinkering, as Philadelphia could use help at cornerback, wide receiver and defensive tackle.\n\n- Patriots: The defending champs are among the most aggressive teams on the trade market, though they have just $1.4 million in cap space to work with, according to overthecap.com.\n\n- Dolphins: After sending away Kenyan Drake on Monday, the still-winless Dolphins could continue to shed players from their roster in exchange for more draft picks.\n\n- Jets: Miami isn't the only struggling AFC East team that could undergo a significant shift, as New York established itself as a seller by trading away Leonard Williams.\n\n- Lions: Whether it's dealing away top CB Darius Slay or bringing in help at RB, Detroit could be an active player on Tuesday.\n\n- Saints: Adding a wide receiver to complement Michael Thomas could be a consideration for the NFC South leaders.", "description": "Tuesday marks the trade deadline in the NFL, and if the previous few days were any indication, there could be a flurry of deals forthcoming.", "authors": ["Usa Today Sports", "Published P.M.
