He then posted a birdie and eight pars on the back nine to finish his round at 8-under 64, tied with fellow American Talor Gooch.\n\nThe 29 matches Cook's best nine-hole score, the 6-under run to end the front nine matches the lowest score over five holes on the PGA Tour this season, and the 64 is one shot off the Golf Club of Houston record, held by six golfers.\n\nThe Houston Open is also the site of Cook's second career Tour start, in 2015. He qualified for that event with another 8-under round, that time on Monday. He entered the weekend one shot off the lead and even grabbed the outright lead early Sunday.\n\nBut five bogeys and no birdies over the final 10 holes not only cost him the tournament, it cost him a spot in the Masters the following week. And by finishing tied for 11th, missing the top 10, he also missed out on another guaranteed spot in a Tour event.\n\nOn Thursday, Cook, 28, hit all 18 greens in regulation and missed only two fairways. The highlight of his round was his second shot on the par-5 No. 8, where he put the ball within 12 feet of the pin from 218 yards out. He converted the putt for his eagle.\n\n\"To be honest, I think in '15 I was a little more consistent, as kind of this year shows,\" Cook said, according to pgatour.com.\n\nGooch's day was much more up and down, with the 27-year-old making six pars, 10 birdies and two bogeys. Gooch is coming off a season in which he notched two top-five finishes and qualified for the FedEx Cup playoffs for the first time.\n\nAustrian Sepp Straka's 7-under 65 has him one shot back in third place, while Americans Russell Henley, Lanto Griffin and Tyler McCumber are tied for fourth at 6 under. A group of seven golfers are another stroke back.\n\n--Field Level News", "description": "Making his first start in four years at the Houston Open -- site of one of the  biggest disappointments of his young career -- Austin Cook tied his career...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
