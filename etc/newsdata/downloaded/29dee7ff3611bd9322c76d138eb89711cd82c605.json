He has since had a life-changing procedure to create him a knee joint using his foot, which has been turned backwards\n\nMr Degnan, a delivery driver, said: 'We never knew something like this would even be possible, it took several explanations from our doctors to understand how it worked.\n\n'We looked for visuals to know what we could expect and our decision took a lot of thought to make because ultimately we would be changing his appearance for life.\n\n'The thing with rotationplasty surgery is that you do anything you would normally do after it, he can be a kid, jump on a trampoline, run, ride a bike and play sports.\n\n'Now they have reattached it, his foot is backwards and his ankle and foot will become his knew knee, once his prosthetic is built he'll have a normal functioning leg.'\n\nHe added: 'When you first see it it's shocking, even as his parents we catch ourselves looking at him trying to get our head around it.'\n\n'We completely understand that it's not exactly the most pleasing thing to look at, especially for him, but in the long run it's going to be so much better for him.\n\nHis parents opted against a full-leg amputation to treat Austin's cancer because traditional prosthetics struggle to replicate a knee joint (pictured, his leg after the operation)\n\nAustin, who refers to himself as having a 'little leg', said: 'It will be big again soon and I'll be playing outside in no time' (pictured in hospital)\n\nWHAT IS A ROTATIONPLASTY? Rotationplasty is a surgical procedure often offered to children with bone cancer around their knee joints. The operation involves removing cancerous bone, as well as some healthy bone, to ensure a 'clear margin'. The lower leg is then rotated 180 degrees and reattached. This gives the appearance of a short leg with a foot on backwards. The foot and ankle then function as a knee joint, which allows the patient to wear more functional below-knee prosthetics. Advantages include children being better able to perform sports and everyday activities. Complications can include reduced blood supply, infections, nerve injury and delayed healing.

It occurs when the cells that grow new bone form a cancerous tumor.\n\nFigures show around 160 people are diagnosed with osteosarcoma each year in the UK. There are up to 900 cases each year in the US.\n\nMost tumours usually develop around the knee area, either in the lower part of the thighbone or the upper part of the shinbone.\n\nThe type of bone cancer has 'amongst the lowest survival rates of all the childhood cancers', according to Children With Cancer UK.\n\nMr Degnan said: 'It was heart-breaking knowing that our son had essentially been on his death bed right under our noses.\n\n'We were terrified of what might happen to him but we knew we just had to tackle the situation head on and try to get our son better.'\n\nAustin's surgeon told the boy's family about two types of treatment, one of which was the rotationplasty.\n\nThe procedure is often offered to children with bone cancer.
