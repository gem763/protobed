The look was a little reminiscent of Word Art of old: the 3D letters tipped back, with strange pixelated edges.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It was still functioning largely as a search engine for Stanford University, as well as the web, and offered an explanation of what it was at the top with a little text box underneath.\n\nThe logo then got slightly more grown-up. It got a little flattened down \u2013 the 3D letters becoming curvy rather than looking like real objects \u2013 and the colours changed.\n\nGoogle also briefly got an exclamation mark in 1999. It disappeared a year later.\n\nThat shouting logo would be the last very different one that the site would have. Until today\u2019s redesign, the site stuck by its formula: two blue letters, two red and one yellow and one green, all in an entirely unobjectionable serif font.\n\nThe company would gradually change that look, moving letters around, softening the colours and getting rid of shadow, but the concept remained the same until 2015.\n\nMost recently, it dropped the serifs that made the letters distinctive but harder to read on the tiny screens of mobiles. In doing so, it recognised one of the most important changes during its 21 years \u2013 like Google itself, the logo had been designed to be looked at on screens, but now a huge proportion of web browsing is done from phones and other mobile devices.", "description": "Google is celebrating its 21st birthday today, marking the occasion with a special Doodle.
