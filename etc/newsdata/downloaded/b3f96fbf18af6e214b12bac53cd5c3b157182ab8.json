He has been working for more than 25 years in a job he\u2019s \u201cnever really loved,\u201d and he says the last four years in particular have been \u201cdepressing.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d love to retire, but here\u2019s the problem: He has two children who haven\u2019t gone to college yet, and his wife \u2014 who is working as a teacher \u2014 believes he still needs to work, although it could be at a different job than the one he has now.\n\nBut the man says he\u2019d rather not.\n\n\u201cFriend just got cancer in early 40s. I don\u2019t want to die at this desk,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have tried to get consulting or other things going on the side but not much success.\u201d\n\nSuggestions poured in. But many focused on how depressed the original poster was when he wrote about his desperation. He also mentioned that he\u2019s started drinking more, in his original post.\n\n\u201cAddress the depression and the drinking before making any big decisions about employment,\u201d one response said. \u201cYou have taken the first step, which is recognizing this is a path you don\u2019t want to continue to walk.\u201d\n\n(The man replied and said he is already seeing a therapist.)\n\nBut another commenter, \u201ctrollmum,\u201d suggested another tactic: \u201cbarista FIRE.\u201d\n\nHow about taking on \u201ca little part time job to keep you busy and to make sure your wife is not annoyed at you,\u201d she suggested. \u201cMaybe a bit of consulting on the side.\u201d\n\nSo, what the heck is \u201cbarista FIRE\u201d? It\u2019s a term that might not be known to those who don\u2019t follow the \u201cfinancial independence/retire early\u201d (FIRE) movement closely.\n\nSee also: These people left their jobs behind to retire early \u2014 then life got in the way. Here\u2019s how they coped with FIRE plans gone wrong\n\nBasically, it\u2019s internet parlance for retiring from a full-time job, but continuing to work part-time.\n\nThe blogger Financial Samurai takes a \u2026 blunter approach.\n\n\u201cBarista FIRE is retiring early but making your spouse work,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA lot of men have started to claim they retired early, but are really just stay at home spouses while their wives slave away at a job they hate.\u201d\n\nThat said, he admitted he was a \u201cbarista\u201d retiree at one time; when he negotiated a severance in 2012 at age 34, his wife continued to work, and he was able to be on her health insurance.\n\nBarista FIRE might be an option for the original poster on Reddit. Some commenters even suggested he may be able to dial back at his current job and work part-time.\n\nBut there\u2019s another approach, said a commenter named \u201ceayaz,\u201d who said their parents retired and live modestly.\n\n\u201cThey take small trips constantly. They love each other. They enjoy their grandkids,\u201d eayaz wrote.\n\n\u201cIf you love building motorcycles, you can do it at any income. If you love yoga, you can do it at any income \u2026 You just gotta focus more on enjoying the journey.\u201d", "description": "This retirement middle ground could be a solution for many.", "authors": ["Maria Lamagna"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HE358_MLBari_ZG_20190221125536.jpg"}
