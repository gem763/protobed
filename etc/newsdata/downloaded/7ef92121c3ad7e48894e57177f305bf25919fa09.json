Other investors include Michale Ovitz, Honda Keisuke and Kevin Durant. Some of the investors in this latest round don\u2019t have much in common beyond being LPs in the Andreessen Horowitz Cultural Leadership Fund, which seems to be the glue holding these stars together.\n\nSandbox VR operates physical spaces, generally in retail locations, that users can play multiplayer virtual reality games inside with friends. It\u2019s a next-generation arcade of sorts that\u2019s relying on expensive new technology to attract customers, but that formula hasn\u2019t been a slam dunk for plenty of other VR startups, and it\u2019s forced the leadership to get creative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult space to be in, because it\u2019s one of those spaces where you have to be three startups in one,\u201d Sandbox VR exec Siqi Chen told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cYou have to build your own content, build your own technology and construct and operate retail locations.\u201d\n\nWhile most virtual reality startups that have raised substantial amounts of capital have had to dump it into R&D, Sandbox\u2019s business is more focused on pinning virtual reality experiences to physical real estate giving the curious a hub to try out the technology.\n\nSandbox has plenty of obstacles ahead, the most dire of which will be building a content ecosystem that\u2019s exclusive to the system. Even Facebook\u2019s Oculus has struggled to court established studios to the system without bankrolling development, a process that could get very expensive very quickly for Sandbox. Consumer expectations are also quite high given the steep $48 ticket prices for the 30 minute experience. Sandbox recently partnered with CBS Interactive Studios to create a title based on Star Trek IP.\n\nSandbox will have to compete with consumer headsets like the Oculus Quest that are far cheaper and simpler than previous-generation at-home headsets. The startup will also have to find ways to deepen experiences while still relying on plenty of off-the-shelf consumer hardware. Sandbox\u2019s success relies at least a bit on consumer VR headset adoption growing at a sluggish pace, something Facebook is still spending billions to accelerate.\n\nGenerating venture-sized returns will undoubtedly involve more than jacking up ticket prices for more immersive games, though we haven\u2019t heard much of a grand vision from the young startup yet. Whatever Sandbox does, the team is going to have to walk in the same footsteps of many VR companies before it all while improving perceptions of the technology, something the company\u2019s executives hope their new celebrity investor friends can help with.\n\nFor Sandbox, gathering attention from celebrities like Kanye West has already been part of the strategy. \u201cPart of it is brand, in that VR is not perceived as a cool thing to do,\u201d Chen says. \u201cSo having influential people onboard helps with that perception a bit.\u201d\n\nSandbox has 16 locations planned by the end of 2020. The company has now raised a whopping $82 million.", "description": "How funding rounds are classified these days has much more to do with positioning than any VC definitions, but it\u2019s still true that nothing has quite the pizazz as the \u201cstrategic investment\u201d celebrity party round.
