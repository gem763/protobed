I didn\u2019t choose the title; I wanted it to be called No Good Deed Goes Unpunished, because the film is basically me getting into trouble from start to finish.\n\nDid it make you sentimental for Australia?\n\nI'm always sentimental for Australia. I love Australia and wish I could move back to Sydney \u2013 it's where I'm from; it's my tribe. But I'm a single dad over here in LA with a 20-year-old son [Chance Hogan with ex-wife Linda Kozlowski] who's in a band, and he's not quite ready to be left yet. He is 20, but kids don't tend to mature as fast these days as we used to. Seems you're not really grown up nowadays till 30.\n\nWhere would you move \u2013 back to your roots?\n\nCut it out! I was from Chullora in Sydney's western suburbs. As soon as I got some money, I moved my young family to Mosman [on the city's posh lower north shore]. When I'm home these days, I love staying with my daughter \u2013 she's on the northern beaches. We go out for beaut family Japanese dinners at Momokko in Belrose. It's run by a terrific bloke called Charlie.\n\nThese days, Hogan lives right on the boardwalk of LA's Venice Beach. Shutterstock\n\nAt least you're living on Venice Beach in Los Angeles \u2026\n\nYou mean \"the ghetto by the shore\" \u2013 that's what the locals call Venice. Being near a beach feels a bit like home. I live right on the boardwalk; it's great for watching all the lunatics of LA strolling past.\n\nSo where's hot with Hollywood types right now?\n\nI don't hang out with many celebrities \u2013 a bit with [actor and filmmaker] Gary Oldman, but that's pretty much it. I used to hang out with Chris Hemsworth, but he's moved back home to Byron Bay. My favourite local is The Firehouse, inside an old fire station downtown.\n\nI only fly in first class if someone else is paying; if I\u2019m paying, it\u2019s business class. \u2014 Paul Hogan\n\nWill Trump be impeached? And if not, will he win the 2020 presidential election?\n\nMy hunch is he won't be impeached \u2013 but if he is, I will really miss him. He's a galah, but he's the most entertaining politician since [Roman emperor] Caligula. If he makes it through to the end of 2020, I have a sneaky suspicion he'll win in November next year. The Democrats don't have any charismatic, malleable opponents. Unless they can convince Oprah or Ellen [DeGeneres] to run, I'd say they're stuffed.\n\nAll-time favourite holiday destination?\n\nItaly, end of story. I adore Italy and I've been there many times: Rome, Venice, the Amalfi Coast \u2013 I love all of it. In Rome, I stay at Hotel Hassler, at the top of the Spanish Steps. The Belmond Hotel Caruso in Ravello is a superb spot that overlooks the Amalfi. A few years ago, I met [actor] Michael Caine when I was staying at the Belmond Splendido Mare in Portofino.", "description": "Hoges has been selling Australia since he first slipped \u201ca shrimp on the barbie\u201d in 1984, but the 80-year-old calls Los Angeles home \u2013 for now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0001%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_776%2C$y_683/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4255a2bfb301a45d71cde87cf953a84bd019c8e9", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
