It\u2019s about the size of a car: 10 feet long, 7 feet tall, and 2,314 pounds of pure robot.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nNarrator: In February of 2011, the International Space Station was home to six astronauts and one Robonaut. Not to be mistaken for a spaghetti-legged member of Daft Punk, NASA\u2019s Robonaut 2 was actually the first humanoid robot ever sent to space.\n\nClip: And are you sure this guy isn\u2019t related to Hal?\n\nNarrator: It spent about four years on the space station before it had a hardwire malfunction in 2015, and then another three years lying broken and creepy until NASA retrieved it in 2018. After a round of repairs, it\u2019s set to return to the space station later this year, but it might not be alone, NASA has a full slate of other wonderfully weird robots it wants to send to space in the near future, and luckily none of the rest participated in a beefcake photo shoot no one asked for.\n\nThis is Dragonfly. The first multirotor vehicle from NASA that will ever set foot, er, ski, on another planet. Part robot, part space drone, Dragonfly will make the 759,000-mile eight-year journey to Titan, Saturn\u2019s largest moon. Rivers, lakes, and seas across its surface are filled with not water, but liquid methane and ethane.\n\nTitan is the only place in the solar system besides Earth with standing bodies of liquid. But there are places along the surface that contain evidence of past liquid water and the complex molecules key to producing life, that\u2019s what Dragonfly is after. During a 2.5 year mission, the rotorcraft will land in the Shangri-La dune fields and make its way to the Selk impact crater where scientists believe the ingredients for the recipe for life once existed.\n\nThe coolest part? Titan has the capacity for life as we know it, and life as we don\u2019t. The evidence of water shows habitable conditions for life-forms similar to those on Earth, but the liquid methane and ethane could also be home to life, just nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before.\n\nDragonfly will focus on both in order to better understand the origin of life in the universe. It\u2019s set to launch in 2026 but won\u2019t arrive until 2034. LEMUR is more like the mother of robots than its own thing, but we\u2019re counting it anyway.\n\nLEMUR stands for Limbed Excursion Mechanical Utility Robot, it\u2019s got four limbs and was originally conceived as a repair robot for the International Space Station. It uses 16 fingers covered in hundreds of tiny fishhooks, plus a sprinkle of artificial intelligence to scale walls and avoid obstacles.\n\nThe original project ended in 2019, but technology from LEMUR is being used in other robots that still have the potential for space travel.\n\nThe Ice Worm could be the name of a terrible superhero, but in this case it\u2019s a little squiggly robot. It\u2019s derived from a single LEMUR limb and it moves by scrunching and un-scrunching, just like an inchworm. It\u2019s part of a family of projects in development to explore Saturn\u2019s and Jupiter\u2019s icy moons.\n\nThe worm drills into the ice, end over end in order to climb or stabilise itself while collecting samples. It also inherited its mama\u2019s AI, which helps it navigate by learning from past slipups.\n\nAnother LEMUR kid is the RoboSimian. Originally designed as a disaster-relief robot, this humanoid bot has the same four limbs as LEMUR, but its feet are a little different. Instead of grippy feet, the robot, nicknamed King Louie, has wheels made with piano wire that help it roll over uneven ground.\n\nThat\u2019s especially helpful in icy environments like Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, which is what it\u2019s being developed for now. RoboSimian can walk, crawl, inch, and even slide on its belly like a penguin. All to meet the challenges presented by silty, breakable ground.\n\nSome micro-climbers use LEMUR\u2019s fishhook technology to cling to rough surfaces; others use gecko-like adhesive to climb smooth walls. All of them are pocket-sized vehicles strong enough to survive 9-foot drops.\n\nThe gecko-inspired tech relies on van der Waals forces, which are basically what happens when you stick a balloon to your head with static electricity, but on a molecular level. NASA hopes to use these little guys to repair spacecraft or explore hard-to-reach spots on the moon, or Mars, or anywhere really.\n\nArguably the most famous robot on its way to Mars is the Mars 2020 Rover. It\u2019s about the size of a car: 10 feet long, 7 feet tall, and 2,314 pounds of pure robot. It\u2019s based on Curiosity, the NASA rover that landed on Mars in 2012. Relying on a proven system cuts down on costs and risks.\n\nThe new rover will continue to search for past and present habitable conditions and signs of life. But it\u2019s bringing to the table a new drill that can bore holes in the surface and store the soil and rock samples for later use. Potentially a transport from Mars back to Earth so they can be studied in labs, but the rover won\u2019t be roving all alone.\n\nInside the Mars Rover will be a little MOXIE, or the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment. Its job is to prove it can make oxygen on Mars for fuel and breathing \u2013 like a happy little robot plant. Mars\u2019 atmosphere is made up of about 96% carbon dioxide, no good for humans. This car-battery-sized version of MOXIE will only be able to produce about 10 grams of oxygen per hour. Future oxygen generators will need to be about 100 times larger for manned missions.\n\nIntroducing the Mars Chopper. The small, solar-powered helicopter will, fingers crossed, be the first in history to prove heavier-than-air vehicles can fly on other planets, and that\u2019s basically its sole purpose. Just like MOXIE, it will act as a proof of concept for future missions. The challenge is that Mars\u2019 atmosphere has 1% the density of Earth\u2019s, making it nearly impossible for helicopters to fly at all. So far it\u2019s passed a number of important tests that give scientists hope that they will be able to defy the laws of physics.\n\nBut even if it can\u2019t fly, the chopper will basically be the parrot to the Mars Rover\u2019s pirate. Engineers are developing grippers that will allow the copter to cling to cliffsides, a lot like a bird perches on a branch, and surprise, it\u2019s another LEMUR baby. Its feet use the same fishhook technology as the four-limbed bot.\n\nThere\u2019s one more robot already up in space that needs to \u201cbee\u201d included. It\u2019s called Astrobee, and I think that\u2019s reason enough for why we have to mention them. There are three Astrobees: Honey, Queen, and Bumble, obviously. Bumble and Honey shot up to the Space Station in April 2019, and Queen followed regally in July.\n\nThe free-floating cubes were designed to alleviate some of the more routine tasks that astronauts complete daily, like taking inventory or moving cargo. But they will also be competing with Robonaut 2 for the title of Weirdest Robot in the International Space Station.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
