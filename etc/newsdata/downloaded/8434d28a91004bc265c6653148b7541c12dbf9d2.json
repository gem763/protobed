The real estate mogul, however, remained the Republican nominee and won the presidential election a month later. Bush was fired days after the tape\u2019s release.\n\nAsked why he didn\u2019t confront Trump about his lewd remarks at the time, Bush told King that he was worried about losing him as a guest.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s the kind of guy who would say, \u2018Forget Billy Bush,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a little anxious around him because you just want [the interview] to end well and get out.\u201d\n\nBilly Bush returned to TV last night as host of the entertainment show @ExtraTV. Coming up in a network exclusive with @GayleKing, Bush tells us that since the \"Access Hollywood\" tape went public, he's had zero contact with President Trump. pic.twitter.com/Zr5KoRInpR \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) September 10, 2019\n\nBush made his return to TV on Monday as a host on NBC\u2019s \u201cExtra,\u201d where he addressed the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape scandal and how\u2019s he evolved over the last three years.\n\n\u201cBad things happen to all of us,\u201d Bush said during Monday\u2019s episode of the entertainment news show. \u201cGoing forward I will no doubt have to report on people who have had a bad moment. I\u2019m especially interested in seeing them own it and get back up.\u201d\n\nDuring his interview with King, Bush said he\u2019s \u201cvery grateful\u201d for his new job and is looking forward to \u201cspeaking the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember what it feels like to be all the way down,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t ever forget that, and think that\u2019s a valuable asset.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had ever thought about harming himself during that time, Bush said, \u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mind ... plays terrible games on you, when you\u2019re lying on a floor and you\u2019re crying and pulling your hair out,\u201d Bush said, adding that he never felt he was a \u201cserious candidate\u201d for self-harm.\n\n\u201cClose to the end of the rope, but not at the frays,\u201d he said.\n\nBush claimed the tape had been \u201cweaponized\u201d and that he was essentially caught in the crossfire, adding that \u201ceveryone\u201d at NBC knew about the tape before it was released.\n\n\u201cI got taken out but I wasn\u2019t the target,\u201d he told King. \u201cI was told, \u2018You\u2019re good. Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not you. You didn\u2019t say anything.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut after some reflection, he said he felt he was \u201cdue for some kind of reckoning in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I needed to grow up a bit,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump, who has been accused by dozens of women of sexual misconduct, had initially dismissed the comments he made on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d He later reportedly told some people that the voice in the recording wasn\u2019t his, prompting Bush to fire back in an op-ed for The New York Times in 2017.\n\n\u201cOf course he said it,\u201d Bush wrote. \u201cAnd we laughed along, without a single doubt that this was hypothetical hot air from America\u2019s highest-rated bloviator. ... We now know better.\u201d\n\nWatch Bush\u2019s full interview with \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d here.", "description": "The new \"Extra\" host, during an interview with CBS' Gayle King, discussed the scandal that cost him his job and his recent return to TV.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7790e83b0000c49fd0c4e6.png?cache=ihyaatwi9w&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
