There are two new rovers heading to the planet Mars in the near future and some of the scientists involved in the projects are predicting that they will almost certainly find life on the red planet when they arrive. Probably not aliens living in cities or anything like that, but at least some extremophiles living in the subsurface regions where we now know water remains.\n\nThe disappointing part of the story is the reaction of one of NASA\u2019s leading scientists. He\u2019s expressing concerns that humanity may not be ready to deal with the knowledge that life exists somewhere off of this planet. (The Independent)\n\nNasa is close to finding life on Mars but the world is not ready for the \u201crevolutionary\u201d implications of the discovery, the space agency\u2019s chief scientist has said. Dr Jim Green has warned that two rovers from Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) could find evidence of life within months of arriving on Mars in March 2021. The ExoMars Rover, which has been dubbed \u201cRosalind\u201d in memory of British chemist Rosalind Franklin, will search for extra-terrestrial life by drilling 6.5 feet down into Mars\u2019 core to take samples. Those samples will then be crushed up and examined for organic matter in a mobile laboratory. Dr Green compared the potential discovery to when the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus stated that the Earth revolves around the Sun in the 16th century.\n\nFirst of all, the teams working on these rovers are probably still being a bit more optimistic than scientific when it comes to predictions of finding life on Mars by 2021. To date, all of the signals we\u2019ve detected that might have indicated the presence of life (such as whiffs of methane or what appear to be fossilized microorganisms buried in Martian rocks) have turned out to be false positives or inconclusive.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t find life. It\u2019s now obvious that there was once a vast amount of water on the planet which means there was a thicker atmosphere then as well. And some of that water remains underground. If there was ever any type of life on Mars there\u2019s probably still some remaining bits lurking under the surface.\n\nBut what about this idea that we\u2019re not prepared to hear the news? Dr. Green is quoted as saying that such an announcement would \u201cstart a whole new line of thinking.\u201d And that\u2019s something he believes we as a species \u201caren\u2019t prepared for the results.\u201d\n\nSorry, but I have to disagree with that. And it sounds like the same line of reasoning that the government has used to be secretive about such subjects for decades. There may have been a time when that was true\u2026 maybe. Consider the chaos that erupted when War of the Worlds first debuted on the radio in New Jersey. But those were people who thought they were listening to a radio broadcast of an actual hostile alien invasion.\n\nThe more abstract question of alien life that isn\u2019t shooting death rays at us seems to be much less disturbing to the public at large. Recent surveys have shown that half of the population already believes there is intelligent life elsewhere. More than 60% believe there\u2019s some sort of life, even if it\u2019s not intelligent.\n\nOn top of that, consider that 2017 New York Times article when we first learned that the government had been secretly studying UFOs in our airspace and the Navy\u2019s recent admission that they have no idea what they are. That\u2019s all but an admission that they\u2019re extraterrestrial and you don\u2019t see people freaking out in the streets.\n\nI just think Dr. Green is off the mark here. I believe that humanity is ready to cope with such a revelation if it turns out to be true. I\u2019m far more concerned about whether or not they turn out to be hostile and if we\u2019re prepared for that eventuality. (There\u2019s something for you to freak out over.) But the general idea that there\u2019s life elsewhere in the galaxy?
