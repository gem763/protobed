(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nA letter sent Thursday from the chair of the House Science Committee to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross reveals that it was the Commerce Department, not the leadership of its National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that drafted a controversial NOAA statement on Sept. 6 that backed President Trump\u2019s false statement about the path of Hurricane Dorian. That statement contradicted NOAA\u2019s own meteorologists at a weather forecast office in Birmingham, Ala.\n\nThe unsigned statement has generated at least three investigations, including one by the Science Committee, another by NOAA\u2019s chief scientist, as well as the Commerce Department\u2019s inspector general. The new letter, from Committee Chair Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), contains previously unknown information about how that statement \u2014 which may have violated NOAA\u2019s scientific integrity policy \u2014 was written.\n\nThe background\n\nTrump wrongly tweeted that Alabama would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d on Sept. 1 even when the state was not within the National Hurricane Center\u2019s \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d \u2014 the zone most likely to be affected. The National Weather Service forecast office in Birmingham, responding to an influx of calls from worried residents in the wake of the president\u2019s tweet, issued a tweet of its own saying Dorian would not affect Alabama.\n\nAt the time, the NWS\u2019s forecast guidance showed only a very small risk (about 5 percent) of tropical-storm-force winds for a small portion of Alabama.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet that Alabama would be affected by the storm gained national attention when, during an Oval Office press availability, he presented the version of the forecast cone from Aug. 29, extended into Alabama \u2014 modified using a Sharpie. The crudely altered map appeared to represent an effort to retroactively justify the original Alabama tweet.\n\nThe players\n\nThe new letter reveals that the drafting process for the NOAA statement, which rebuked the Birmingham forecast office for speaking \u201cin absolute terms,\u201d was orchestrated by three of Ross\u2019s top deputies, including his chief of staff.\n\nAccording to the letter, that information was passed on to the Science Committee by Neil Jacobs, acting head of NOAA, in an interview with committee staff last week. Now the Science Committee is asking for interviews with the Commerce Department officials as well as communications concerning the NOAA statement and drafts of it.\n\n[NOAA\u2019s chief scientist will investigate why agency backed Trump over its experts on Dorian, email shows]\n\nIn addition, Jacobs told the Science Committee that White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was \u201cinvolved in high-level conversations\u201d about the statement, through the Commerce Department officials. As The Washington Post has previously reported, Mulvaney was acting at the request of Trump.\n\nJacobs reported that he was first contacted about issuing the statement during the predawn hours of Sept. 6 by Michael Walsh Jr., chief of staff to Ross, and that the statement was drafted on the computer of Dave Dewhirst, deputy general counsel at the Commerce Department.\n\nJacobs said Commerce political staff provided feedback on the draft statement and that Earl Comstock, the agency\u2019s director of policy, was also involved. Within NOAA, Julie Kay Roberts, another political appointee who serves as Jacobs\u2019s deputy chief of staff and communications director, was also engaged in drafting the statement, Jacobs said.\n\n[In all-staff email, NOAA chief praises scientists after agency\u2019s defense of incorrect Trump tweet]\n\nAside from Jacobs himself, who holds a PhD in meteorology, none of the individuals involved in its drafting is a scientist. NOAA\u2019s scientific integrity policy prohibits political interference with the conduct and communication of the agency\u2019s scientific findings.\n\nJacobs had fought issuing the statement and also tried to block the paragraph that admonished the National Weather Service office in Birmingham that tweeted that Alabama would \u201cNOT see any impacts\u201d from Hurricane Dorian. However, Jacobs lost both those arguments, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Post.\n\nThe Science Committee letter was a follow-up to a letter sent on Sept. 11 to Ross requesting answers to questions and documents pertaining to Trump\u2019s tweet and the events that followed. The Sept. 11 letter requested a response from the Commerce Department by Sept. 20, but Thursday\u2019s letter noted that the Committee \u201chas yet to receive any responsive materials\u201d and asked for them \u201cas soon as possible\u201d \u2014 no later than Oct. 18.", "description": "A new letter from the House Science Committee chair reveals new information on the origins of the controversial NOAA statement backing President Trump's false Hurricane Dorian claims.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "October At Pm", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7AfTQuh201EpS3z5MHkV3miEhWM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UW2KZ7GPSYI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
