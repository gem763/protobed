This week we look at how to design an eclectic, yet chic, tablescape .\n\n\n\nSuccessful entertaining is equal parts food and d\u00e9cor\u2014the centerpiece of which is the table itself. Instead of relying on standard settings, hues and arrangements, why not use some out-of-the box ideas to liven things up?\n\n\u201cAn eclectic table setting can add to the ambience of an event by setting a unique tone that sets the night apart,\u201d said Caroline Brackett, principal of Caroline Brackett Studio of Design based in Greenville, South Carolina. \u201cUnexpected objects let guests know that the event was well thought out, curated, designed, and ultimately that they are an honored guest at a special night.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo set an interesting scheme, follow these tips from the design pros.\n\nThink Outside the Box\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the tables at a charity ball we worked on recently, we used a variety of sizes and styles of antique brass candlesticks. They didn\u2019t match and were different heights, but the mix worked beautifully. Things don\u2019t have to match perfectly. ...Different colored candles, mixed china patterns or something hanging from the chandeliers draws the eye and adds interest. Other than fabric for your tablecloth, opt for burlap or even a flat weave rug.\n\n\u201cUsing unpredictable vessels for florals (cups, busts, baskets, hurricane, antique porcelain, et cetera) keeps it interesting. You might also have a small arrangement at each setting that serves as a party favor for guests to take home.\n\n\n\nDesigned by Phillip Thomas, founder and principal of Phillip Thomas Inc., this table takes a mystical cue from the artwork in the room and uses a crystal ball as a centerpiece. Michael Mundy\n\n\u201cI love mixing china patterns. I love plates that don\u2019t feel like plates (lettuce ware for example); I love flatware in a unique finish. It\u2019s important to always have special place cards made, but they don\u2019t have to be paper (think: leaves). Glassware can be varied, as well. Milk glass with crystal? Yes, please.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a good idea to keep a theme in mind, but not one that will be obvious to your guests. Pick a color from a flower and carry that through in the candles and linens, for example. Always keep the colors of the season in mind and let that influence and inspire.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Caroline Brackett, Principal of Caroline Brackett Studio of Design based in Greenville, South Carolina\n\nAdd Personality\n\n\u201cWhen I am hosting a dinner where guests don\u2019t necessarily know one another, I like to include accessories that are relevant to the occasion and help to break the ice and start conversations. For example, at one dinner, I decided to use vintage postcards of foreign destinations as people\u2019s place cards. I knew that each guest enjoyed traveling so I thought this would be a great way to break the ice and have them bond over exotic destinations.\n\n\n\nDesigned by Phillip Thomas, founder and principal of Phillip Thomas Inc., this table takes a mystical cue from the artwork in the room and uses a crystal ball as a centerpiece. Michael Mundy\n\n\u201cI also like to choose accessories that are a reflection of me. The accessories don\u2019t necessarily match but they all relate in some way to one another and elicit conversation and create a warm environment of conviviality. I like to choose accessories that are a little tongue and cheek to break the ice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile flowers are important, I find candlelight to be even more important. Everyone looks great under the glow of candlelight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Phillip Thomas, founder and principal of Phillip Thomas Inc. in New York City.\n\nConsider Every Element\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen accessorizing with floral arrangements, we gravitate toward simple, elegant blooms and succulents to create contrast with texture and color, such as a combination of warmer toned flower arrangements complemented by cooler toned succulents. During the holidays, it\u2019s a given that most arrangements will include trademark hues within the red, green and yellow varieties. To keep these traditional palettes fresh and contemporary, we add texture through the greenery and succulents, making sure each arrangement is full of color and variety.\n\n\n\nMetallic pumpkins and crystal-clad candles add a whimsical touch to a tablescape designed by Nancy Charbonneau principal designer of Charbonneau Interiors. Charbonneau Interiors\n\n\u201cOur favorite way to place an eclectic setting involves four things: unexpected patterns, varying textures, bright colors and geometric designs. Playing with eclectic settings with these four elements adds interest and playfulness to any dinner party, inviting guests in for not only a good meal, but a good time. Changing up the plates between place settings is also a great way to stay true to an eclectic theme, while still playing with patterns and colors.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen thinking about accessorizing a setting to compliment the colors and lines of a china set, we add in more texture with things like brass silverware, classic outlines with drinkware, and a little of the unexpected with things like Kate Spade hedgehog shakers. The best part about the eclectic style is the ability to play with so many elements that would traditionally have no place at the table.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Nancy Charbonneau, principal designer of Charbonneau Interiors, based in The Woodlands, Texas\n\nLook to the Season\n\n\n\n\u201cA tablescape is very much a conversation piece and a statement in one. If your table is appealing enough, people will want to pick up certain objects, ask where your silver is from, and point out different pieces which can lead to wonderful stories (i.e. this was my grandmother's china from Europe and these candlesticks were our first wedding gift, etc.)\n\n\n\n\u201cMix high and low vases, unique pottery and tapered candles with votives. Imperfection can be perfect. We like to trim roses to fit into silver and gold votives or sprinkle flowers throughout a long table mixed with higher arrangements.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ideal to play off a season or the china you\u2019ve opted to use for the evening. It's autumn now, and we are all about throwing in some small pumpkins and burnt orange hues of flowers. We hosted a dinner in the winter and used classic Herend blue 'Chinese Bouquet' dinnerware paired with colored glasses to play off of the indigo from the plates.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Tierney Model Ehrhart, co-founder, August PR, a public relations and event planning firm in New York\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Jennifer Tzeses"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-112257?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280"}
