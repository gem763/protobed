In the report, which is independent from government, Davies sets out a plethora of recommendations to tackle the issue.\n\nMost eye-catching is the ban on eating or drinking on public transport, which is explained as a way for children to grow up \u201cfree from marketing, signals and incentives to consume unhealthy food and drinks.\u201d (Breastfeeding, drinking water and eating or drinking for a medical condition would be exempt.)\n\nDavies also floats the possibility of introducing standardized packaging for food, which is already used for tobacco, as well as phasing out of all advertising for unhealthy foods and drinks.\n\nIn addition, she called for the national sugar tax to cover milk-based drinks \u2014 something that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said would hit the poorest the hardest. However, Davies offered up evidence that children in the most deprived areas in fact benefit the most from the sugar levy.\n\nThe government isn't under any obligation to follow through with her recommendations, but Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that his department would study the report closely \u201cand act on the evidence.\u201d", "description": "Ex-chief medical officer calls for the national sugar tax to cover milk-based drinks.", "authors": ["Ashleigh Furlong"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-484803007-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
