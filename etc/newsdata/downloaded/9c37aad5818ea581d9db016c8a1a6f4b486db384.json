The savings have contributed to the rebuild of their home on the NSW south coast.\n\nCassandra Michelin (pictured with her family), from New South Wales, was dropping her children off at school in May this year when neighbours saw their 'whole house up in flames'\n\nThe family still have no idea what caused the fire, although they were told it started in the kitchen (pictured)\n\nThe family hope to be able to move back to the property in a year, after their insurance company have said they will assist in the rebuilding of their entire home.\n\nCassandra was dropping her children off at school earlier this year when her neighbours saw their 'whole house go up in flames' and called the firefighters.\n\nIn just 45 minutes, they lost everything.\n\n'It was the most emotional time in our lives and it really put so much strain and stress on our family,' the 32-year-old said.\n\n'We still have no idea what caused it. Having four small children, our lives have always been busy and this just really took its toll on all of us, especially on my weight and energy.'\n\nKnowing they would have to spend much of their savings rebuilding their home, Cassandra was looking for ways to cut down on weekly costs, and decided to take charge of their shopping bill.\n\n'Being such a big family, and with gluten-free dietary requirements, I believe we were probably spending between $350-$450 a week on food before the fire,' Cassandra said.\n\nWhat are Cassandra's budget meal prepping tips? Freezer friendly meals: Make meals that are freezable. Allow time: Give yourself a good chunk of time to meal prep properly. Play music while you cook: Tunes that keep you motivated. Have containers ready to go: Look over the meals you're making and make sure you have the right containers whether you're portioning into single serves or the full meal.\n\nShe came across the Healthy Mummy 28 Day Weight Loss Challenge app while searching for budget-friendly meals and decided to try the workouts and food they suggested.\n\nThat way she could gain back some of the self confidence she lost after the tragedy while still feeding her family cheap and nutritious meals.\n\n'It took a huge leap.\n\n'But I decided it didn't have to be like this, I didn't have to go on feeling emotionally and physically exhausted,' she said.\n\nCassandra said she 'allowed herself the permission' to give back to herself, after she had let herself go.\n\nShe came across the Healthy Mummy 28 day weight loss challenge app while searching for budget-friendly meals and decided to try the workouts and food they suggested\n\nShe set the app to the 'budget' plan and used a few hours on Sunday to create all of her gluten free breakfasts, lunches and dinners\n\nShe set the app to the 'budget' plan and used a few hours each Sunday to create all of her gluten-free breakfasts, lunches and dinners.\n\n'I now spend under $250 on groceries for every gluten-free meal and snack.
