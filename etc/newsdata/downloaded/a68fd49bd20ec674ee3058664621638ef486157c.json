(AP) - New Hampshire health officials say the number of hepatitis A cases in the state is on the rise.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday that from last November to early September, 220 people were diagnosed with the disease, compared to an average of six or seven annually in recent years. One person in Merrimack County died.\n\nBeth Daly, chief of the Bureau of Infection Disease Control, tells WMUR-TV there\u2019s been a national outbreak of over 25,000 hepatitis A cases.\n\nState officials said the disease thrives in homeless populations, where people are often crowded together and don\u2019t have access to bathrooms, showers or clean laundry. Hepatitis A causes inflammation of the liver and can include fever, nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, and jaundice. It\u2019s preventable with a vaccine.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: WMUR-TV, http://wmur.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New Hampshire health officials say the number of hepatitis A cases in the state is on the rise.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
