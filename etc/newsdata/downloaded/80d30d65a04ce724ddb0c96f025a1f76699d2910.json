Manufacturers need to hire 20,000 to 25,000 production workers and 5,000 engineers every year just to remain at a constant level, he said.\n\n\u201cThe governor has put a focus on vocational education and trying to provide workers with the skills needed,\u201d Denzler said, but lately there has been no money for job-training programs.\n\nManufacturers have some advantages in the near future, including a growing advanced-manufacturing industry around the Chicago area, he said. But the state needs major structural reforms and begin to live within its means, according to Denzler.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, Illinois needs to change its focus moving forward,\u201d he said.\n\nIllinois did end it\u2019s more than two-year-long budget stalemate last week, but it came at a high cost to both businesses and workers, who will both see tax increases.\n\n\u201c[Last week\u2019s] action by the Illinois legislature will speed up the loss of manufacturing jobs and will further decimate our economy,\u201d Greg Baise, president and CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers Association, said shortly after the state House voted to override Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s vetoes of the tax hikes and budget bills.\n\nThose knowledgeable about the manufacturing industries in other Midwest states questioned some of the conclusions in the Ball State University study. Kurt Bauer, president and CEO of Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, took issue with the state\u2019s \u201cC-\u201d grade in the \u201cTax Climate\u201d category.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Ball State report recognizes that Wisconsin\u2019s Manufacturers and Agricultural Production Tax Credit reduces the corporate tax liability for qualifying companies from 7.9 percent to 0.4 percent,\u201d Bauer said in an email to Illinois News Network. \u201cCombine that with our right-to-work status and our recent regulatory and litigation reforms, and Wisconsin is clearly one of the most attractive states for manufacturing in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAll of Illinois\u2019 neighbors are right-to-work states \u2013 meaning employees can opt out of joining a union if they choose \u2013 which is another competitive disadvantage.\n\nProfessor Edward Hill, a faculty member at the Ohio Manufacturing Institute, took issue with some of the variables the study used to give Ohio a \u201cC-\u201d in \u201cHuman Capital.\u201d The six states receiving \u201cA\u201d grades in this category were Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota and Washington.\n\n\u201cThere are good manufacturers in many of these states, but none, with the exception of Washington and possibly Minnesota, can be claimed as centers of exceptionally skilled pools of manufacturing workers,\u201d Hill said.\n\nStill, Ohio is not doing particularly well in providing the type of skilled workers manufacturers need, he said, but all states likely have this problem.\n\n\u201cManufacturers themselves are just waking up and taking ownership of the problem \u2026 and reinventing secondary and community college manufacturing training programs,\u201d Hill said.\n\nIn Ohio, major employers such as Honda, Minster Machine, Lincoln Electric and Yaskawa Motoman are working hand-in-hand with educators to turn out a more skilled workforce, he said.\n\n\u201cWe will see progress over the coming year,\u201d Hill said.\n\nThough Michigan was rated a top performer in manufacturing, it received \u201cD\u201d grades in both \u201cHuman Capital\u201d and \u201cSector Diversification\u201d in the Ball State study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all tuned to just transportation,\u201d Devaraj said, adding that the lack of diversification in Michigan\u2019s manufacturing economy means that if any shocks hit that industry, the impact for the state as a whole will be major.\n\nRecently released economic forecasts for Michigan have been positive. A University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, study said that the state recorded 28 straight quarters of payroll growth through the first quarter of 2017. But job growth should moderate through 2018, the report said.\n\n\u201cManufacturing employment declines modestly over the forecast, reflecting the slowdown in the light vehicle sector,\u201d the University of Michigan forecast said.\n\nDevaraj stressed that manufacturing remains a key player in the U.S. economy, even as productivity gains have held down employment growth. Increased skill attainment by workers will help lower the risk of them being replaced by automation, he said.\n\n\u201cIn reality, things are going really well in terms of manufacturing,\u201d Devaraj said.\n\nBack in Illinois, the state earned an \u201cA\u201d for the health of its logistics industries. That was due to a number of Illinois\u2019 assets, including its central location, the value of shipped goods in the state and an efficient transportation system.\n\n\u201cChicago is leading the pack in terms of the commodities flows,\u201d Devaraj told Illinois News Network.", "description": "The Midwest as a whole received relatively high grades in .09/02/2019 3:02:29AM EST.", "authors": ["Michael Carroll", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
