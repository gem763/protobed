History will not look favourably on anyone who calls us \u2018uncooperative crusties\u2019. We have to put them in a \u00adposition where they have to listen.\u201d\n\nChris, 58, indicated he is expecting a long-fought battle \u2013 saying he was prepared to get himself arrested, but \u201cmuch later\u201d when the time was right.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe emotion I feel most of the time is frustration and anger. The best thing is to channel it into activism.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion set up camp in Trafalgar Square for the week\u2019s protests. Supporters glued themselves to \u00adbuildings, barricaded the BBC and tried to halt flights at London City Airport.\n\n(Image: Sonja Horsman)\n\nParalympic cycling gold medallist James Brown was yesterday banned from going near any UK airport after denying causing a public nuisance by gluing himself to the top of a plane.\n\nBrown, 55, was bailed by Westminster magistrates to appear at crown court next month.\n\nThere were more arrests today at a blockade of Billingsgate fish market.\n\n(Image: Sonja Horsman)\n\n(Image: Sonja Horsman)\n\nRob Cooper, an ex Devon and Cornwall Chief Superintendent, was also at the protests.\n\nRob, 60, said: \u201cI joined for the same reasons I joined the police \u2013 to protect my community. I\u2019m concerned for everybody, but especially for my five-year-old granddaughter.\u201d\n\nDr Deepa Shah, 36, a GP in Hackney, East London, said she felt obliged to protest as climate change \u201cis a massive risk to the health of future patients\u201d.\n\n(Image: Sonja Horsman)\n\nMethodist minister Jo Rand, 42, from Cumbria \u2013 locked up for 24 hours \u2013 said: \u201cAs a community leader I have to do something. I read a Bible and prayed. I thought, what a gift.\u201d\n\nBishop of Liverpool Paul Bayes, 65, also protested.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m a grandfather of three, I\u2019d like them to grow up. It\u2019s a non-violent group who want to make a difference \u2013 the church should be with them.\u201d\n\nFormer banker Andrew Medhurst, 53, of Wandsworth, south-west London, said: \u201cI was in a pension company encouraging people to save for the next 30 years. It felt fraudulent.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: TV wildlife expert Packham says 'history will not look favourably' on Johnson after Extinction Rebellion 'crusties' jibe", "authors": ["Halina Watts", "Image", "Tim Merry", "Pa", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Sonja Horsman"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566403.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PROD-HS2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
