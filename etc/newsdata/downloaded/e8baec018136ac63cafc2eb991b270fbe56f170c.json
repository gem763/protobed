It was 4-0 in the end, Harry Kane hitting a hat-trick to go above Geoff Hurst in the country\u2019s scoring charts with 26 in all, Raheem Sterling claiming the other in yet another display that indicated he has moved onto another level.\n\nOr at least it would, if the opposition weren\u2019t so submissive. This is also why it\u2019s difficult to read too much into this from an England perspective, too. They are now undeniably one of the best teams in the world and potential Euro 2020 winners but their ability to just trample over teams like this Bulgaria and the Czech Republic side in this group is as much to do with a wider problem in international football as their own rise, and the FA\u2019s fine structural work.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He was never going to do much in this game.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Player ratings from England vs Bulgaria Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Despite having so many ball-players in the squad, he went with one player who is primarily a ball-winner in Declan Rice and two ball-runners in Jordan Henderson and Ross Barkley.\n\nIt was difficult not to link this to a more rigid first-half performance, especially against a Bulgarian team willing to cede the vast majority of the pitch in front of their own 18-yard box.\n\nA counter-argument from Southgate might be the Liverpool point that it is precisely this type of midfield that is necessary to free the attackers in front of them. And freed Sterling was.\n\nThis was yet another game where he displayed how he\u2019s soaring onto another level as a player.\n\nHe is, however, also able to dig in. It was Sterling\u2019s persistence - and quite a lot of Bulgarian incompetence - that led to a classically Manchester City cut-back goal.\n\nThere are fair questions about why a visiting side who were seemingly so determined to themselves play a classically defensive approach went for a modern proactive approach to goal-kicks, that seeing keeper Plamen Iliev almost inevitably rush it and put centre-half Vasil Bozhikov under pressure.\n\nSterling and the rest of the England attack were already just ready to pounce on them in that ravenous manner that indicates inherent knowledge you\u2019re so superior. So it was the forward so easily snapped on that bad pass, got around Bozhikov, and set up Kane.\n\nThat was that as far as any semblance of a contest. That\u2019s because this is it as far as any semblance of a Bulgarian team.\n\nIt was thereafter just a question of how many England would get, and when.\n\nMarcus Rashford was brought down for the first penalty just before half-time, with Kane naturally scoring, before completing his hat-trick after being fouled himself for the second penalty later on.\n\nIn between, the captain also set up for Sterling for the easiest of finishes.\n\nIt was the easiest of matches, but just another facile win.\n\nAfterwards, Rice described it as \u201canother tough game\u201d, with a straight face.\n\nEngland are headed straight for Euro 2020, with barely a bump on the road. There may barely be a goal conceded on the road. There\u2019s just too much of a contrast.", "description": "England\u2019s perfect record in this qualification campaign continues, in a game that displays one the many imperfections in international football right now.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/07/18/Raheem-Sterling.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
