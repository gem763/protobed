That has the support of 93% of Republicans, 79% of independents and 67% of Democrats. The survey also revealed that Americans are not so confident in one another when it comes to who or what to vote for, and how the process works.\n\n\u201cA majority of Americans (53%) have little/no confidence in the wisdom of the American people when it comes to making choices on Election Day,\u201d the survey analysis said. \u201cThere is a partisan divide on the question: While a majority of Republicans (54%) do have confidence in voters, both Democrats (43%) and independents (45%) do not.\u201d\n\nReputation wise, the 2020 presidential election gets mixed reviews. A majority \u2014 53% \u2014 are confident that it will be open and fair. But there is a pronounced partisan divide: 72% of Republicans said the election would be open fair, along with 55% of independents. Only 39% of Democrats, however, agreed with this.\n\nMeanwhile, another 44% overall think elections are rigged \u201cin favor of the rich and powerful\u201d; 28% of Republicans, 50% of independents and 53% of Democrats agreed.\n\nThe sides found a little unity on one idea, and that is the gravity of elections themselves.\n\nThe poll found that seven out of 10 Americans say they go to the polls because they believe \u201celections have consequences\u201d; 70% of Republicans, 74% of independents and 71% of Democrats agreed.\n\nStill, elections bring out a spectrum of reactions. The poll also found that 58% of all Americans believe foreign governments pose a threat to U.S. elections, a belief shared by 41% of Republicans \u2014 along with 58% of independents and 77% of Democrats.\n\nAmericans are also jittery about security. Just 31% are confident the government protects elections from foreign interference, a sentiment also marked by partisan reaction: 54% of Republicans, 27% of independents and 16% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u201cRight now, there is a crisis of confidence affecting our democracy,\u201d said Cliff Young, IPSOS president. \u201cBy and large, the American people do not believe our elections are safe from foreign interference, and there is vast partisan disagreement over whether the next election will be open and fair. Whether this lack of confidence can be repaired before next November remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nCynicism about elections, however, has not entirely engulfed the nation. The poll also found that only 12% of Americans overall say they don\u2019t vote because they believe elections don\u2019t bring \u201creal change\u201d in their day to day lives; 8% of Republicans, 11% of independents and 11% of Democrats agree.\n\nThe C-SPAN/Ipsos poll of 1,039 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 23-30 and released Thursday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
