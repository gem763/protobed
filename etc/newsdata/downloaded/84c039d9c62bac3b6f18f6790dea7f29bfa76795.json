That could spell serious trouble for Netanyahu\u2019s lengthy rule.\n\nWithout Lieberman\u2019s endorsement, both parties appear to have fallen well short of securing a parliamentary majority with ideological allies.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

A formal indictment would increase the pressure on Netanyahu to step aside if he does not have immunity.\n\nThe partial results released Wednesday by the Central Election Commission were based on 35% of the vote counted. The three Israeli TV channels reported the same outcome, based on more than 90% of the vote counted, but did not explain the discrepancy with the commission\u2019s percentage.\n\nAccording to the partial results, Likud with its natural allies of religious and ultra-nationalist parties mustered 56 seats \u2014 or five short of the needed majority.\n\nFinal results are expected later Wednesday and could still swing in Netanyahu\u2019s favor.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and Benny Gantz's Blue and White parties are currently tied, falling short of a majority", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/israel_election_tie.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
