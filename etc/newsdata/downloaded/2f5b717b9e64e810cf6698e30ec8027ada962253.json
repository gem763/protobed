Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, and Florida Republican Matt Gaetz, one of Trump\u2019s fiercest defenders in the House, are behind a proposal to require congressional authorization for any attack against Iran. And their amendment is now a major flash point in negotiations with the Senate that kicked off Thursday over a final defense bill\u2026\n\n\u201cIn a time when this town feels like shirts and skins every day, to have 30 Republicans join with Democrats to stand against forever wars has been very therapeutic to some of the corrosive attempts by the war lobby to start three new wars before lunchtime tomorrow,\u201d Gaetz told POLITICO in an interview on Thursday.\n\n\u201cSome of the closest allies of the president \u2026 supported this amendment because they believe in the Constitution,\u201d added Khanna. \u201cGiven what\u2019s going on, I think it\u2019s increased the need for that amendment.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the effort has drawn an unlikely coalition of progressives, centrist military veterans and dozens of Republicans wary of expanding executive war powers.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
