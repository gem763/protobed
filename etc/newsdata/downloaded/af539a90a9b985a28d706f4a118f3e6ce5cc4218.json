Simpson: Michigan football's Jim Harbaugh can fix the Cleveland Browns", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Michigan football head coach Jim Harbaugh speaks to the media on Monday, Oct. 28, 2019, in Ann Arbor. Orion Sang, Detroit Free Press\n\nOK, before you roll your eyes, hear us out.\n\nOnce upon a time, O.J. Simpson was one of the premier football commentators on television. The Hall of Fame running back with a \u2014 ahem \u2014 checkered criminal past has taken to Twitter in the past year and seems to be a natural for the medium.\n\nIn his most recent post, Simpson tried to provide some hope for the Cleveland Browns, who entered this season with high expectations but have sputtered to a 2-5 start with first-year coach Freddie Kitchens.\n\n\"A lot of great college coaches don't do well in the pros, Jimmy Johnson and Pete Carroll exception,\" Simpson said. \"But there's a guy that was a good college coach that I think was better as a pro coach, and he's right next door to you, Cleveland.\n\n\"His name is Jim Harbaugh, and I think he's the elixir to all of your problems.\n\n\"I'm just saying,\" Simpson said to conclude the video.\n\nBOWL PROJECTIONS: LSU moves in after Oklahoma falls out of College Football Playoff\n\nHEISMAN WATCH: LSU QB Joe Burrow takes over as front-runner from Jalen Hurts\n\nKudos to @JoeFlacco, Congratulations to Coach Belichick & @Browns the answer is right next door. pic.twitter.com/2qfCp6G2mV \u2014 O.J. Simpson (@TheRealOJ32) October 28, 2019\n\nIf \u2014 and we stress if \u2014 Harbaugh took the Cleveland gig, it would mark the second U-M coach to leave Ann Arbor for that city. John Beilein is in his first NBA season right now with the Cavaliers after a successful run with the Wolverines.\n\nAnd could you imagine the Harbaugh Bowl twice a year between Jim in Cleveland and brother John in Baltimore?\n\nThe Harbaugh-to-NFL rumors seem to be an annual tradition. The coach tried to address rumblings that emerged via Football Scoop last week, calling it \"total crap\" in a letter addressed to his players' parents.\n\nFollow Kirkland Crawford on Twitter @HiKirkHere.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
