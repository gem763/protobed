The White House has said the review merely sought to ensure the money was properly spent.\n\nBut the freeze irritated diplomats who questioned whether it was tied to Mr. Trump\u2019s demands for Ukraine to investigate two politically fraught allegations: a widely-debunked conspiracy theory about election tampering in 2016 and corruption at an energy company that employed the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. There is no evidence that the Bidens were involved in wrongdoing.\n\nOnce the decision to freeze the aid became public in late August, a bipartisan group of lawmakers pressed the administration to reverse course, saying that holding up the money sent the wrong signal as a new Ukrainian government confronted a continuing military threat from Russia.\n\nWilliam B. Taylor Jr., the top American envoy in Kiev, wrote in a Sept. 9 text message that it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d In response, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, wrote that \u201cthe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nMr. Sondland then suggested that the conversation continue by telephone, rather than by text. On Tuesday, the Trump administration blocked Mr. Sondland from testifying to the House in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOfficials were informed that the freeze had been reversed \u2014 and the $141 million in foreign military financing would be released \u2014 in a Sept. 12 email from the White House that was then sent around the State Department.\n\n\u201cApparently, and I don\u2019t have full visibility, decision made last night,\u201d Mr. Kulikowski wrote.\n\nMr. Freden said the Ukrainian government had already been told that the funds were forthcoming. But he urged State Department employees not to announce the reversal.", "description": "A series of internal State Department emails reflect diplomats\u2019 frustration with the unexpected freeze on funding that Congress had already approved.", "authors": ["Lara Jakes"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/us/politics/09dc-diplo-sub/09dc-diplo-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
