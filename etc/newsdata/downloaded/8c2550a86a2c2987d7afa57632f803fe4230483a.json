Swedish broadcaster TV4 reported that the U.S. Special Representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, who led the U.S. team, had arrived back at the country\u2019s embassy in central Stockholm.\n\nThe Swedish foreign ministry declined to comment.\n\nThe meeting at an isolated conference center on the outskirts of Stockholm was the first formal working-level discussion since U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in June and agreed to restart negotiations that stalled after a failed summit in Vietnam in February.\n\nSince June American officials had struggled to persuade North Korea to return to the table, but that appeared to change this week when North Korea abruptly announced that it had agreed to hold talks.\n\nOn Saturday evening, negotiator Kim Myong Gil accused the United States of having no intention of solving the countries\u2019 difficulties through dialogue, but said a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was still possible.\n\nHowever, he said it would only happen \u201cwhen all the obstacles that threaten our safety and check our development are removed completely without a shadow of doubt\u201d.\n\nThis appeared to be a reference to North Korea\u2019s desire to see moves from Washington to ease economic pressure on it.\n\nTENSIONS\n\nThe delegation from North Korea, also known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), which is under sanctions banning much of its trade due to its nuclear program, arrived in Sweden on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts have said the leaders of both countries faced growing incentives to reach a deal, although it was unclear whether common ground could be found after months of tension and deadlock.\n\nOnly a day after announcing the new talks, North Korea said it had test-fired a new ballistic missile designed for submarine launch, a provocative gesture that also underscored the need for Washington to move quickly to negotiate limits on Pyongyang\u2019s growing arsenal.\n\nSpeaking in Athens on the last leg of a tour of southern Europe while the talks were still underway in Stockholm, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said he was hopeful of progress in the talks.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful this will be the first time that we\u2019ve had a chance to have a discussion in quite some time and that there remains to be a lot of work that will have to be done by the two teams,\u201d he told a news conference.", "description": "Officials from Pyongyang and Washington failed to come to an agreement during a meeting in Sweden.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d98f87c200000f2004d3fd1.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
