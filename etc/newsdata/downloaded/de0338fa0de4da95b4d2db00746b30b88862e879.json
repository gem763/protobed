The emotional outburst came after he was hit with questions surrounding a negative report of his career.\n\nLawrence VanDyke, a Trump nominee for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, was asked about concerns that the American Bar Association (ABA) brought forth about his treatment of LGBT people. The group told lawmakers that VanDyke would not say whether he would be fair to LGBT litigants who appeared before him.\n\n\u201cI did not say that,\u201d he said, fighting through tears. \u201cI do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God, and they should all be treated with dignity and respect.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe ABA sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday rating VanDyke, a former solicitor general in both Nevada and Montana, as \u201cnot qualified\u201d following an investigation in which the group interviewed dozens of lawyers and judges who worked with him.\n\n\u201cSome interviewees raised concerns about whether Mr. VanDyke would be fair to persons who are gay, lesbian, or otherwise part of the LGBTQ community,\u201d the letter reads. \"Mr. VanDyke would not say affirmatively that he would be fair to any litigant before him, notably members of the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nA \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of the ABA\u2019s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary voted to rate VanDyke \u201cnot qualified,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe report on VanDyke has not been made public, but the letter also alluded to other concerns that had been raised to the ABA saying he is \u201carrogant, lazy, an ideologue, and lacking in knowledge of the day-to-day practice including procedural rules\u201d the letter continued.\n\n\u201cEven though Mr. VanDyke is clearly smart, comments were made that in some oral arguments he missed issues fundamental to the analysis of the case. There were reports that his preparation and performance were lacking in some cases in which he did not have a particular personal or political interest.\u201d\n\nRepublican senators have dismissed the ABA\u2019s rating as a partisan attack \u2014 noting that a member of the group's standing committee responsible for the Ninth Circuit donated to one of VanDyke's political opponents \u2014 while Democrats have used it to raise further questions about his qualifications.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s confirmation hearing, Sen.
