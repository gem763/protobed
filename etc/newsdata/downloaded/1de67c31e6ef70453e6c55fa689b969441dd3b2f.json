In the eight-month period in 2015: England: 213 Scotland: 44 Northern Ireland: 41 Ireland: 7 Wales: 0 Total: 305\n\nA total of 305 new cases were diagnosed among eight to 17-year-olds, most of them in young women (91 per cent) and of white ethnicity (92 per cent).\n\nBased on these figures, the researchers calculated an annual anorexia incidence rate of 26 for every 100,000 girls and two for every 100,000 boys.\n\nThis calculates to an overall rate of 14 new cases for every 100,000 children and teens aged eight to 17.\n\nThe researchers said it was difficult to compare this with previous estimates which had included data for 18 and 19 year olds.\n\nThe rates of diagnosis rose steadily with age, peaking at the age of 16, according to the results published in the BMJ Open.\n\nAround 30 cases of anorexia were diagnosed out of every 100,000 children aged between 14 and 16-years-old.\n\nThere are a number of risks for eating disorders, including genetics and personality traits - such as low self-esteem, obsessive personality or perfectionism.\n\nCultural pressures are increasingly becoming a problem, particularly in the form of social media, according to experts.\n\nAlexia Dempsey, a specialist eating disorder dietitian at The Priory's Roehampton Hospital in south-west London, who was not involved in the study, told MailOnline: 'More than half of children, by the age of 10, have access to social media.\n\n'They will likely be viewing \"idealised\" or heavily edited pictures and images, as well as posting their own images for the external judgement of their peers and strangers in the form of \"likes\" and \"shares\".'\n\nInstagram and Facebook have an age limit of 13, but have been criticised in the past for failing to enforce the rule strictly.\n\nInstagram bosses recently revealed it will censor posts glorifying or promoting cosmetic surgery and fat-burning products as part of a major clampdown on the causes fueling body image worries among youngsters.\n\nMs Dempsey said: 'It is easy to see how young minds might be influenced by, or obsess over, their favourite athlete or celebrity.\n\n'We also see young people who have heard \"anti-obesity\" messages and cut out sugar and \"junk food\" at school, or received information through media channels and then followed this advice regardless of their body weight being in normal range, in an attempt to feel healthy or \"better about themselves\".\n\n'This lack of nutrition can lead to obsessional thoughts about food, impaired cognitive functioning and feelings of low mood and anxiety - and eventually an eating disorder.'\n\nLeading eating disorder charity Beat conceded there is evidence anorexia - and eating disorders - are increasing in children.\n\nDirector of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said: 'There are several reasons that there may be more eight to 12-year-olds being referred to a mental health service.\n\n'While this rise in the number of young children being diagnosed with anorexia could mean that the condition is developing at an earlier age than in the past, it could also be due to improvement in the ability of healthcare professionals to identify children with anorexia.\n\n'We strongly endorse the recommendation of the researchers that service providers and commissioners should consider the possibility of an increase in anorexia among younger children.'\n\nCurrent estimates for anorexia in youngsters are mostly derived from GP records.\n\nThis study was based on data given by specialist psychiatrists, but not all treatment centres in the UK and Ireland have these.\n\nTherefore, the estimation is not clear-cut, Mr Quinn said. 'The real number of sufferers could be even higher across all age bands,' he said.\n\n'In addition, some young people may not be identified as having an eating disorder, so they may not receive a referral to a mental health service.'\n\nOfficial figures released today show there were 350 admissions to hospital a week last year for people suffering an eating disorder, mostly anorexia.\n\nAccording to NHS digital, 4,008 were logged as teenagers under the age of 19, 374 for ten to 12-year-olds, and 158 aged nine or younger.\n\nRates have increased by 23 per cent among women aged 26 to 40 in the past year alone.", "description": "Data analysed by Kings College London shows\u00a03.2 children aged 8-12 per 100,000 are diagnosed per year.
