None of us have played in a semi-final before, it's a challenge but we're very excited to get out there.\n\n\"They have gone with a pretty big pack. That's fine with us. We are used to that. In terms of the line-out (Scott Barrett) is a good jumper.\n\n\"He's normally a second row forward. But I think we have addressed that and have the callers and jumpers to deal with it.\n\n\"They have a great pack and have a lot of great players across the board - but so do we. We have two of the best packs in the world going up against each other.\"\n\nPA", "description": "England\u00a0will review their travel plans for Saturday's Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand\u00a0after arriving late for today's captain's run.
