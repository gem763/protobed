Australian shares were up 0.5 per cent. Japan's Nikkei stock index opened higher but reversed course and fell 0.3 per cent.\n\nUS stock futures, fell 0.44 per cent in Asia on Monday after the S&P 500 surged 1.4 per cent on Friday.\n\nThe offshore yuan fell 0.3 per cent to 7.1352 to the US dollar after Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are signalling they are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by US President Donald Trump.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThere was no onshore yuan trading, as Monday is the last day of a long China holiday for its national day.\n\nThe media report also pushed up safe-haven assets such as gold and the yen.\n\nCrude oil futures extended declines in a sign that investors remain cautious about a resolution to the trade dispute.\n\nSentiment toward the US economy deteriorated sharply much of last week after disappointing data on manufacturing and services suggested the trade war was taking a toll, and more rate cuts would be needed to avert a potential recession in the world's biggest economy.\n\nBut a modest September increase in US jobs, announced on Friday, eased some of these concerns and lifted US markets that day. The US unemployment rate fell to 3.5 per cent in September to reach the lowest since December 1969. Non-farm payrolls also grew in September, but slightly less than expected.\n\n\"Moderate job growth and subdued inflation in the United States is a positive for stocks,\" said Shusuke Yamada, head of FX and Japan equity strategy at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities in Tokyo.\n\nThis week, the main focus will be the high-level US-China trade negotiations expected in Washington on Oct 10-11 to see if the two sides can end a bruising year-long trade war that has hurt global growth and raised the risk of recession.\n\n\"The dollar is a little soft heading into US-China trade talks,\" said Mr Yamada. \"I see some scope for yen gains, but it is not likely to be a big move higher.\"\n\nThe United States and China have slapped tariffs on each other's goods as part of a long-running dispute over Beijing's trading practices, which Washington says are unfair.\n\nCentral banks around the world have been easing policy to try to offset the impact of the trade war.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates twice this year. Before the jobs report, traders saw a 85.2 per cent chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points to 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent this month, but that chance has now fallen to 81.1 per cent, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.5238 per cent on Monday compared with its US close of 1.514 per cent on Friday.\n\nSpot gold, an asset often bought during times of uncertainty, rose 0.15 per cent to US$1,506.93 per ounce.\n\nThe yen, also considered a safe-haven asset, edged slightly higher to 106.83 versus the US dollar and gained to 72.17 per Australian dollar.\n\nUS crude dipped 0.21 per cent to US$52.70 a barrel. Brent crude fell 0.39 per cent to US$58.13 per barrel. In addition to worries about the global economy, signs of oversupply in the oil market are weighing on futures prices.\n\nPolitical instability in Hong Kong could hurt market sentiment after China's army took the unusual step of issuing warnings to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong over the weekend.\n\nHong Kong's stock market is closed on Monday for a public holiday. Trading will resume on Tuesday.\n\nFour months of often violent protests against Chinese rule has pushed the former British colony to the brink of recession and posed a serious challenge to Beijing's control of the city.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - [TOKYO] Asian shares edged higher on Monday after data showed the US unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in almost 50 years, easing concerns of a slowdown in the world's largest economy. .
