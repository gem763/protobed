(They\u2019re also often loaded with sugar, salt, fat and/or refined carbs.)\n\nBut new research shows that we\u2019re doing comfort food all wrong. In fact, cutting out processed foods and adding in more fruits, vegetables and fish doesn\u2019t just make you healthier \u2014 it may also make you happier.\n\nA small, randomized trial published in PLOS One this week (just in time for World Mental Health Day) looked at 76 adults ages 17 to 35, who all scored \u201cmoderate to high\u201d on a scale of depression symptoms used by doctors, and who also consumed diets that were high in processed foods, saturated fats and refined carbohydrates.\n\nRelated: Your no B.S. guide to losing weight in the New Year\n\nThe subjects were split into two groups. One was encouraged to eat healthier by receiving money for grocery shopping, a small hamper of pantry items, as well as tips to eating healthier, whole foods. Researchers checked in on them twice a week for three weeks to see how their diets were going. The control group, on the other hand, didn\u2019t receive any food, money or nutritional guidance.\n\nAnd at the end of three weeks, those on the diet who ate more fruits, vegetables and fish \u2014 aka a Mediterranean-style diet \u2014 saw their moods significantly improve, and their \u201cmoderate to high\u201d depression scores dropped within a normal range. Those in the control group who had stuck to their less healthy diets didn\u2019t see change to their moods or scores. Three months later, the subjects who continued with the healthy eating habits continued to have elevated moods and more improved life outlooks.\n\nRelated: When children stop eating these foods, they\u2019re more likely to become obese\n\nNow, this was a very small trial, and more randomized control trials are needed to establish whether there really is a cause-effect relationship between diets and depression. The control group in this case did nothing, for instance. Future research should compare the outcomes of people who eat healthy with those trying a different intervention, such as social support, to show how effective a new diet would be in comparison.\n\nAnd no one is saying that simply eating more vegetables can take the place of therapy and medication in treating depression and other mental health conditions.\n\nBut as study co-author Heather Francis, a nutritional neuroscience researcher from Macquarie University in Sydney, told Live Science, \u201cThese findings add to a growing literature to suggest that healthy diet can be recommended as an effective therapy to improve depression symptoms, as an adjunct to pharmacological and psychological therapy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Eating this spice found in Indian food could make you happier\n\nOne in five U.S. adults experience mental illness each year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and one in six U.S. youth ages six to 17 also have a mental health disorder. It\u2019s estimated that serious mental illness causes $193.2 billion in lost earnings in the U.S. alone each year, and costs the global economy $1 trillion annually, NAMI reports.\n\nPrevious studies have also suggested that changes to diet \u2014 and following a Mediterranean diet, in particular \u2014 could improve symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\nA 2018 meta-analysis of more than 1.5 million healthy adults found that those who most closely followed a Mediterranean diet had a 33% lower risk of developing depression over eight to 12 years compared with those whose diets were the most opposite. What\u2019s more, a 2018 study published in the World Journal of Psychiatry came up with an Antidepressant Food Scale. And topping its list of the 12 best foods loaded with nutrients that influence depression were bivalves (clams and mussels) and seafood packed with vitamin B12, iron, zinc, copper, calcium and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as leafy greens, lettuces, peppers and cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower and broccoli) also packed with iron and vitamins.\n\nRelated: This is the right way to eat carbs\n\nOn the flip side, those familiar sweet or salty comfort foods that provide a pick-me-up in the moment can end up making you feel worse. Foods that spike your blood sugar (like sweets, white breads and processed starches like pasta and french fries) often lead to a \u201ccrash\u201d later on \u2014 like feeling shaky, lethargic, irritable or anxious in the afternoon.\n\nIn fact, a systematic review of 12 studies that looked at diet and mental health in children and adolescents found that eating more saturated fat, refined carbs and processed foods led to worse mental health.", "description": "A new study suggests that diet can help mental health.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT069_Medite_ZG_20191010123146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
