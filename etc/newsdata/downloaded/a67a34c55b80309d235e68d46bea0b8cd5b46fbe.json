Speaking on ABC News' This Week, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the preferred solution would be for Democratic leaders in Congress to work with the White House to \"stop this awful crisis that is taking place at our border.\"\n\nCracking down on illegal immigration has been a central theme of the Trump presidency, and in his interview with NPR, Gidley said Trump is trying to make good on that promise through the sanctuary cities plan.\n\nGidley said the White House has put forward multiple proposals to stem the flow of illegal immigration, but Democrats have not \"come to the table.\"\n\n\"So the logical answer is to give them something they want,\" said Gidley. \"Democrats say that if you even think about rejecting people into this country illegally, that you are somehow racist. So the question then becomes, do Democrats want to allow these people to be shipped into their communities?\"\n\nGidley specifically singled out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco district as one potential destination.\n\n\"We looked at it and said, where are the logical places to kind of spread the wealth, if you will, and places like San Francisco, for example, or a sanctuary city, they are designed and set up specifically to have people there who aren't here legally,\" he said. \"That's what their stated goal is, so there is no reason we shouldn't be looking at a way to give them exactly what they want.\"\n\nLast week, Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for Pelosi, told The Washington Post, \"The extent of this administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated. Using human beings \u2014 including little children \u2014 as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.\"\n\nThe proposal has already faced questions about its cost and legality. Responding to those questions, the president tweeted on Saturday that the U.S. government \"has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Democrats denounced the proposal as a political tactic. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said the president was using the plan to energize his base.\n\n\"My understanding is that it is not legal. There is no budget for that purpose,\" Cardin said. \"This is clearly a political move for the president. He is using the immigrants as pawns in a political game of chess.\"", "description": "White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said a threat by President Trump to send detained immigrants to sanctuary cities should not be seen as a form of \"political retribution.\"", "authors": ["Shannon Van Sant"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/04/14/gettyimages-1135871831-594x594_wide-d82003b77cf6855f536b0fa3cb7810cda75ffdff.jpg?s=1400"}
