But hey, when you\u2019re done filling sandbags or packing up to evacuate, make sure all your bills are paid on time, OK?\n\nWhether you\u2019re a budget stickler or struggle to keep track of your finances, having to deal with an emergency that\u2019s completely outside of your control can really throw a wrench in completing everyday tasks like managing your money.\n\nBanks and credit card issuers know this. In fact, financial institutions often proactively offer their customers in an affected geographic region some sort of grace period. The emergency services they can offer range from waiving late fees or allowing missed payments, to options like expedited card replacement or emergency credit line increases, said Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards.com.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a certain amount of PR to it,\u201d Schulz said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also good business to keep your customers happy.\u201d He explained that accommodations like waiving fees or payment extensions for one geographic region doesn\u2019t have a huge impact on a bank\u2019s bottom line. In turn, a customer will be happy with the bank, and might stick around longer.\n\nDon\u2019t wait for your bank to offer assistance\n\nIf your bank doesn\u2019t reach out first and you expect there\u2019s an inconvenient, unavoidable natural situation headed your way, Schulz recommends calling your bank as soon as possible. Even if your payment history isn\u2019t spotless, it\u2019s still worth making the call to ask about a grace period that might apply to you. Calling after a disaster strikes may not even be possible, if the event knocks out phone or internet service for a while.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a disaster or whether you\u2019re negotiating rates or fees, even in good times, generally you have more power over your credit card issuer than you realise you do,\u201d Schulz said. Banks and credit cards are so competitive right now that the odds are an institution you manage your money with is likely to make accommodations to keep you a happy customer.\n\nAnd regardless of whether you live in a disaster-prone area, it\u2019s always a good idea to have an emergency plan in place for your finances. Making copies of cards and documents \u2014 and keeping them safe and dry \u2013 can make the recovery process go a lot smoother. \u201cIt can save you some real headaches if you think about it in advance rather than after a disaster,\u201d Schulz said.", "description": "It\u2019s tough enough having to deal with the worst-case scenario Mother Nature can throw at you, whether it\u2019s a hurricane, flood, or wildfire.
