And how is slowing down cars and congesting traffic helping with climate change?\u201d one Facebook user asked.\n\n\u201cAwesome work guys, nothing says we are worried about our environment and climate change then holding up a bunch of cars in traffic and leaving a huge carbon footprint,\u201d another said.\n\nOne person branded the activists \u201cselfish fools\u201d who think they are \u201csuperior\u201d to everyone else.\n\nThis protest comes in the lead up to \u201cinternational rebellion week\u201d, which is set to kick off on October 7, where members of the Extinction Rebellion plan to engage in protest around the world.\n\nAustralian members of the activist group have planned protests in all the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nQueensland Police Acting Chief Superintendent, Tony Fleming, said officers are expecting disruptions to occur throughout the week.\n\n\u201cWe are finding Extinction Rebellion are difficult to deal with. It appears their approach is designed to cause significant disruption to the community, to interfere with ordinary people going about their business,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cSo our goal is to try and balance the right to protest with the right of people to have freedom of movement and freedom to live their lives.\u201d\n\nPrevious tactics used by the groups have involved marches, swarming across roads and blocking traffic, gluing themselves to roads and chaining themselves to objects.\n\nPolice have reportedly only been notified about one planned protest for the week, with organisers not seeking permission for any other of the planned events.\n\nMr Fleming said Extinction Rebellion\u2019s attitude towards the police is in stark contrast with the majority of protests planned in the city each year.\n\nHe highlighted the climate change strike that took place on September 20, saying the organisers worked with police to ensure there was minimal disruption to members of the public.\n\n\u201cThat was a good productive relationship with the police where people had the chance to have their say,\u201d Mr Fleming said.\n\n\u201cOur experience with members of Extinction Rebellion contrast with that.\n\n\u201cThere has been substantial planning and preparation, but as you might appreciate, unlike most protests where people are cooperative with us and tell us what they are planning... here we have somewhat of a big unknown.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I expect is that there is a likely impact of the protest on traffic, pedestrian traffic, vehicle traffic and maybe even public transport.\u201d\n\nPolice have launched Operation Romeo Arrowhead to keep traffic flowing in the city during the protests and have prepared for mass arrests that could overflow the capacity of Brisbane watch house.\n\nMr Fleming said confirmed police would use force if necessary and are planning for mass arrests.\n\n\u201cIf that is what is necessary to open up the city then that is what we will do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe last time I saw protests that were spontaneous like this was in the early 1980s.\u201d\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion is urging people across Australia to join in on the disruptions planned for next week.\n\n\u201cTogether, we will peacefully occupy the centres of power and shut them down. We will demand that governments Tell the Truth about our Climate and Ecological Emergency. We will demand that they Act Now,\u201d the group\u2019s Australian website reads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to you. You can\u2019t count on someone else to do this for you. Not us. Not Greta. It\u2019s time to look inside yourself and take action.\u201d", "description": "Motorists in Brisbane\u2019s CBD have had a slow start to the day, with climate change activists staging a \u201cslow ride\u201d protest through the city.", "authors": ["Ally Foster"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cdf94fd5c27f5e282ba9031e2da20227?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
