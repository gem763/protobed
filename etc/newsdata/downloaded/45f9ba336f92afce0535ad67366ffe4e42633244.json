Cover Media\n\nLife with four children, two dogs, a couple of celebrity parents, and a baby on the way is exactly what you might you guess it would be.\n\nChaotic.\n\nHilaria Baldwin, 35, says she doesn't have any magical organizing or philosophical advice for moms and dads. But the pregnant mom of four married to actor Alec Baldwin, 61, has picked up at least a couple of key parenting tips along the way, she told People.\n\nBut what might surprise people is that when Alec Baldwin told the \"Mom Brain\" podcast co-host after they met he wanted children she was kind of \u2014 ready for this? \u2014 meh about it.\n\nShe doesn't play with trolls: Hilaria Baldwin shuts down mom-shamers by inviting them to put and keep a hat on her son\n\n'There were definitely tears': Hilaria Baldwin co-sleeps when breastfeeding her kids, but stopped for her son's 'safety'\n\nHilaria has publicly chronicled her desire for more children and her miscarriage, so it comes as a surprise that she might have ever been lukewarm to the idea of offspring. She said her daughter Carmen, born six years ago, changed everything for her.\n\n\"When I met Alec, he was very focused that he wanted kids. I was 27 \u2014 I knew I wanted kids but it wasn\u2019t something I was thinking about right then,\" she said. \"I was like, 'Am I going to like this?' And I remember as soon as they put her on my chest after I pushed her out, I felt like, 'I need to do this again.' And we did.\"\n\nHilaria Baldwin talks being the mother of multiple children with four now and one more on the way.

Their house also has dogs Dama and Gitana.\n\nTwo Baldwin parent sanity savers\n\nHilaria told People that to maintain sanity, a sense of humor is a must, followed by a particular quality that is easier said that done \u2014 patience. Especially, she said, since her children are no different than any other kids.\n\n\"Trust me, my kids fight, they take toys, they name call, they do all of the things that normal kids do,\" she said. \"What your kid is doing, even if it\u2019s upsetting \u2014 hitting, name-calling, excluding \u2014 that\u2019s normal. We did it when we were young, and so our job is to be patient, to be kind, to be loving, to be firm and to teach right from wrong.\"\n\nAnother Baldwin daughter!\n\nThe couple revealed only last week that they're going to have a second daughter. With the help of their four children, they shared the sex of their fifth child on Instagram.\n\nCarmen helped with the big reveal, while Alec is in the background telling the younger children, \"Shh, watch, what is it?\"\n\nContributing: Sara M Moniuszko\n\nREAD\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/15/pregnant-hilaria-baldwin-says-after-holding-first-daughter-she-wanted-mom-again/3985089002/", "description": "Hilaria Baldwin has her fifth child on the way.
