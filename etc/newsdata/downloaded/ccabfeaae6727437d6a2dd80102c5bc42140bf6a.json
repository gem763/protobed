I wanted to hunt the kingpins.\u201d\n\nAfter a few years as a U.S. Marine, Follis went on to join the DEA almost immediately into the labyrinth of undercover work posing as buyers, sellers, friends, and comrades in the darkest basements of the drug trade.\n\nFollis\u2019 tales of tragedy and triumph are the hallmark of a new high-powered Hollywood podcast. Narrated by \u201cModern Family\u201d star and \u201cMarried... with Children\u201d alum Ed O\u2019Neill, \u201cThe Undercovers,\u201d tells the \u201ctruth is stranger than fiction\u201d life story of Follis, who was \u201cin\u201d the deep throngs of the covert world for almost three decades.\n\nWHERE DOES MEXICO REALLY GET ITS GUNS?\n\nBut, from Follis\u2019 reflected view, having retired seven years ago, undercover work \u2013 which has long been the centerpiece of much of the operations conducted by the DEA and other federal agencies \u2013 has been a crucial piece of the puzzle which is now losing prominence.\n\n\u201cGoing undercover is a dying art, it just isn\u2019t used as much, mostly because of technology,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can listen to everything on the phone, then why do I have to penetrate?\u201d\n\nThe DEA is said to operate some 86 foreign offices in 67 countries, with 750 workers tasked with different duties under the DEA umbrella. Domestically, the administration is said to run 226 field offices spanning 21 divisions.\n\nNonetheless, Follis asserted that a shift toward technology surveillance and less on covert missions would be a glaring mistake.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more convincing that sitting with someone and learning the intricacies,\u201d Follis conjectured. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the intimacies, and those intimate details are the details you need to put someone away for life.\u201d\n\nIndeed, he is noted for going after some of the most notorious drug lords in countries ranging from Thailand, Singapore and China to Afghanistan, Egypt, Mexico and France -- not by tailing them and handcuffing them, but rather by assimilating into their seedy businesses and camouflaging as one of the crew.\n\nDRUG TRAFFICKING KEEPING MADURO IN POWER IN VENEZUELA, ANALYSTS SAY\n\nThroughout his 27-year span, Follis was instrumental in putting away some 29 top-tier narco-traffickers or international drug kingpins.\n\nOne that seemed to hit closest to home was his protracted takedown of Haji Juma Khan Mohammadhasni, better known in intel circles as HJK, a billionaire financier and opium retailer to the Taliban.\n\nIn 2006, Follis cleaved into the South East Asian opium arena by taking the position of Afghanistan\u2019s DEA country attach\u00e9. For two years, he weaved through the coarse mountains and the toffee-colored lands that broiled in the summer and froze in the winter, befriending the notorious HJK. Their friendship bordered a brotherhood, with Khan divulging his most intimate details. Follis even arranged for him to see a cancer specialist in Washington, D.C., after he was struck down with an illness.\n\nAnd then, in 2008, while later working in a leadership position in Los Angeles, Follis got word that his long-held asset was on the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s \u201ckinetic list\u201d to be targeted for death.\n\n\u201cThe military said it needed to do what it does best,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI begged for 90 days; they gave me 60.\u201d\n\nFollis said he called HJK and lured him to meet in Jakarta, Indonesia, where local officials already were lined up to take him in at the behest of the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cThe paradox is that to save his life, I had to take it away,\u201d he said bluntly.\n\n\u201cThe Undercovers,\u201d which Follis described as being refreshingly raw and unfiltered in its account of what really happened in all those murky endeavors, takes listeners on a bumpy journey of close calls and captures, offering a blunt assessment of the $350 billion illicit global trade.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt took me a while to understand the business model, but it is all about money. They are going to tell you it is not about the money, but it is always about the money,\u201d he added. \u201cI would like to think it is about the power or that there is something ethical going on there, but it is always about the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Undercovers\u201d premieres on Tuesday, October 8.", "description": "For almost thirty years, Edward Follis lied about who he was as he dug deeper into the drug underworld, in almost every corner of the globe.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
