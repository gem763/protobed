That is the ultimate measure of one's power in Hollywood.\n\nOr at least that's the way The Hollywood Reporter put it when the Tinsel Town trade mag put former President Barack Obama, 58, and former first lady Michelle Obama, 55, at Number 50 out of 100 on its annual list spotlighting Hollywood's most powerful entertainment industry figures.\n\nNot bad for neophyte media moguls, even if they did spend eight years in the White House.\n\nSince leaving the presidency, the Obamas have successfully scaled both the publishing and entertainment worlds, inking multi-million-dollar deals to publish their memoirs (her \"Becoming\" is already a boffo best-seller, and another book is on the way), and another partnership with Netflix to produce films and TV shows on inspirational stories through their newly launched Higher Ground Productions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who never misses a chance to criticize his predecessor, has noticed, calling on Democrats to investigate the Obamas' business moves instead of whether he's using his presidency to enrich his businesses.\n\n\"I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal,\" Trump tweeted last month.\n\nBut Hollywood has noticed, too, and approves.\n\n\"The former president and first lady kicked off 2019 with a Sundance acquisition \u2013 documentary \"American Factory,\" which premiered to strong reviews on Netflix in August en route to an awards-season run,\" The Hollywood Reporter enthused.\n\n\"If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way,\" predicted USA TODAY.\n\nOther projects in the works include adaptations of David W. Blight's Frederick Douglass biography and Michael Lewis' \"Fifth Risk,\" and \"Bloom,\" a post-World War II-era show about fashion.\n\nAnd don't forget their podcasts deal with Spotify, which will see them develop and lend their voices to select podcasts exclusively for the platform.\n\nThe new 100 list, announced Wednesday, is The Hollywood Reporter's fourth annual compilation of the most powerful people in entertainment. The magazine is touting it as \"the most diverse\" list ever, with the Obamas as the most notable newcomers.\n\nDisney Chairman & CEO Bob Iger holds onto the top spot on the list, with other power players such as ViacomCBS Chairman Shari Redstone (No. 4); actress Zendaya (No. 95); WarnerMedia CEO and AT&T President and COO John Stankey (No. 6); actor-producer Dwayne Johnson (No. 39); and Oprah Winfrey (No. 15).\n\nThe magazine's editors spend months compiling the list, based on \"the size and reach of a person's purview, the success of projects since the previous year\u2019s list, the power to get a project made (company ownership helps) and the ineffables: heat, clout and intangible indicators of influence gleaned from conversations with top insiders (not to mention The Hollywood Reporter's daily reporting).\"\n\nThe full list will appear in the Oct. 16 issue of The Hollywood Reporter and on THR.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/16/obamas-debut-hollywoods-most-powerful-entertainers-list/3997389002/", "description": "It's official: Barack and Michelle Obama are genuine media moguls on Hollywood list of 100 \"most powerful\" entertainment industry figures.", "authors": ["Maria Puente", "Published P.M.
