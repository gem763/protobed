He will.\n\nBeal and the Wizards agreed to a two-year, $72 million maximum extension that will kick in prior to the 2021-22 season, agent Mark Bartelstein confirmed to USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt on Thursday. ESPN first reported the deal.\n\nThe deal also includes a player option for 2022-23 that would prohibit him from hitting free agency for three more seasons and brings the total value of his contract to almost $130 million over the next four years.\n\nBartelstein told ESPN that owner Ted Leonsis and general manager Tommy Sheppard, who had his interim tag removed in July, engaged in a months-long dialogue with Beal to sell him on the future of the franchise.\n\nBeal had been an intriguing trade option for teams, as the Wizards' downturn and John Wall injury clipped short-term expectations for Washington. But the 2011 third overall pick has now lined himself up for a lucrative payday.\n\nIf Beal declines his player option in 2022 but wants to re-sign with the Wizards, he could earn the largest contract in NBA history at five years, $266 million, per ESPN. If he decides to go elsewhere, he'd be in line for a four-year, $198 million maximum payday.", "description": "Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal agreed to a two-year, $72 million max extension with a player option for 2022-23.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/17/USAT/efc5b3d2-8e36-485a-982f-a6a5296551b0-Beal_extension.JPG?crop=1193,671,x675,y443&width=1006&height=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
