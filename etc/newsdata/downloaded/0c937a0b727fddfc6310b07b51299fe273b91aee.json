So the vote was not the cause of it. I think it was in some sense a reflection of it,\" Hall Findlay, president and CEO of the Canada West Foundation, said Sunday on Cross Country Checkup .\n\nShe says Albertans' sense of estrangement from the rest of the country is predicated on the perception the federal government is undermining the province's energy industry in order to move toward environmentally-friendly policies.\n\nHall Findlay argues national policies related to oil and gas should balance sustainability targets as well as economic stability in the region.\n\n\"In 2015, there was a lot of talk about: and. We can have environmental sustainability and economic prosperity \u2026 and a lot of people want to be able to see that.\"\n\nSpeaking with Checkup host Duncan McCue, Hall Findlay says one of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's key tasks following the election is to unite the country in order to avoid separatism talks.\n\nHere's part of that conversation.\n\nYou raise the national unity question. I want to play you a clip from Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. Here's his reaction the day after the election:\n\nIf the frustration and alienation in Alberta continues to mount, it will pose a very serious challenge to national unity. \u2014 Jason Kenney\n\nSo is that rhetoric, Martha Hall Findlay, or is he exaggerating? How does Jason Kenney benefit from all this talk about separatism and Wexit?\n\nI don't think anybody benefits \u2026 I don't know of anybody, and certainly, I take no pleasure in this, but there's no question it's real. There's no question that the frustration is real.\n\nI've lived in Ontario. I spent a lot of time in Quebec. I now live in Alberta, and I'm old enough to have lived through the challenges that we've had with Quebec separation over the years.\n\nMartha Hall Findlay is president and CEO of the Canada West Foundation. (Megan McCleister/CBC)\n\nThis is worse than I've ever seen it in the West, no question. But there is a huge opportunity to move this forward. As I said, the frustration has been building over the last few years.\n\nIt is not something that happened because of the election. There is a big opportunity to go back to that \"and\" discussion. We have to concentrate both on environmental sustainability and economic prosperity.\n\nWhat is the main wish list from Alberta that you think Prime Minister Trudeau needs to move on to keep the West happy then in terms of policy?\n\nFirst and foremost, a recognition of the importance of resources.\n\nSo, yes, the [Trans Mountain] pipeline is really important, but pipelines are somewhat symbolic of the underlying challenge. And that is there has to be a recognition that the oil and gas industry, which, by the way, is working really, really hard in a whole lot of incredible technologies and innovations to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions footprint. Like, there's some really good things happening.\n\nWhat would be really key is to say we all need to address these challenges together. We understand that the world demand for oil is continuing to go up and will for quite a while yet.\n\nWe all recognize we need to have a transformation of our economy. Let's figure out how we can actually do that collectively and proactively as opposed to some of the rhetoric.\n\nFindlay says there needs to be recognition of oil and gas industry at the federal level to avoid this separatist discussion. \u2014@checkupcbc\n\nBut can I push you a little bit on the rhetoric, though, Martha Hall Findlay? On the one hand, Alberta's economy is clearly sputtering.\n\nBut then, on the other hand, the employment rate is still the highest of any province [66.4 per cent for Albertans aged 15 and up vs. a national rate of 62.1]. Albertans have the highest income in the country compared to others. Average wages, they are 15 per cent above [the] national average.\n\nSo do Albertans have as much to complain about as they say they do right now?\n\nThat's a great point, and it's something we actually remind people all the time as well.\n\nThe economy is actually pretty good, and the challenge that we have is in relative terms. It has been far, far stronger in times past.\n\nSo people feel hurt not so much relative to other parts of the country or the world, but certainly relative to the prosperity that was being seen. The challenge is the lack of understanding in the rest of the country \u2014 that also affects the prosperity of the whole country ...\n\nSo it's not just, \"Gee, Albertans are not as economically prosperous as they might have been five years ago; they're still doing OK,\" but it's actually a really important issue for the entire country.\n\nWritten by Jason Vermes.
