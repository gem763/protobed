Photo: Aflo/Shutterstock\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we know about Rudolph Giuliani, it\u2019s that he hates it \u2013 hates it \u2014 when Hunter Biden takes ethically dubious jobs in Eastern Europe. The president\u2019s personal attorney has spent much of the past year trying to strong-arm the Ukrainian government into investigating Joe Biden\u2019s son for any corrupt practices (real or imagined) that he may have engaged in while serving on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Giuliani\u2019s efforts on that front have caused Donald Trump no small number of headaches \u2014 and could cost the 75-year-old multimillionaire his freedom.\n\nBut as of last month, none of the fallout from Rudy\u2019s Kiev vacation was enough to quell his appetite for unearthing Hunter Biden\u2019s shady dealings in the former Soviet bloc. \u201cWe haven\u2019t moved to Romania yet,\u201d Giuliani told Fox News in September, referring to Hunter\u2019s unspecified illicit activities in that nation. \u201cWait \u2018til we get to Romania.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, Hunter Biden did once enjoy an ethically questionable gig in Romania. In 2016, when his father was still vice-president, Hunter agreed to provide legal advice to Gabriel Popoviciu, a Romanian real-estate tycoon who\u2019d recently been convicted on charges of corruption, and was mounting an appeal. In 2014, Joe Biden had forcefully advocated for the Romanian government to crack down on graft within its borders. And there is no evidence that Popoviciu secured any favors from the White House as a result of hiring Hunter. But it is extremely plausible that he hired Biden\u2019s son in the hope that doing so he might ingratiate himself to the Obama administration. If Popoviciu merely wanted the advice of any undistinguished young attorney, he presumably could have found one with a lower hourly rate \u2014 and more familiarity with the finer points of Romanian law \u2014 in his home country.\n\nSo, you can understand why a stickler for legal ethics like Rudy Giuliani would object to Hunter\u2019s behavior. After all, Popoviciu ultimately lost his appeal, and was sentenced to seven years in prison for his kleptocratic land deal. To monetize one\u2019s affiliation with the White House \u2014 by providing legal assistance to such a crook \u2014 goes against everything Giuliani stands for.\n\nWhich, to be clear, is nothing. Rudy Giuliani stands for nothing (he\u2019s more the sitting type). As NBC News reports:\n\nPopoviciu was convicted in 2016 but launched an appeal. He assembled a high profile legal team to fight the conviction, which included former FBI director Louis Freeh \u2026 Freeh continued working on behalf of Popoviciu [after his appeal failed]. Last year, he tapped Giuliani, his longtime friend, to assist in his Romanian work.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s hiring created what appears in hindsight a strange-bedfellows arrangement. Giuliani, who has been the loudest critic of Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the Ukraine, was working on the same side as the younger Biden in Romania.\n\nIn August 2018, Giuliani wrote a letter to Romania\u2019s president and prime minister criticizing the country\u2019s recent efforts to rein in corruption as overly aggressive. Giuliani\u2019s position contradicted the U.S. stance on anti-corruption efforts in Romania.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think that Team Trump\u2019s avowed concerns with corruption in Eastern Europe may not be entirely on the level.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani promised to expose Hunter Biden\u2019s shady dealings in Romania.
