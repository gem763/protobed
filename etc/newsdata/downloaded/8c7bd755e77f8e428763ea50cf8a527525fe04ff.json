But although she\u2019s applied for political asylum, it\u2019s unclear when \u2014 or if \u2014 she\u2019ll ever be able to enter the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cI ask God for a miracle so that we can cross,\u201d said Garcia Perez. She\u2019s one of more than 1,000 migrants camping at a U.S. border crossing in Matamoros, Mexico. The Trump administration\u2019s Migrant Protection Protocols \u2014 better known as the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy \u2014 means they have to wait across on that side while their asylum claims are processed.\n\nAmelia Garcia Perez, left, with her friend Natasha Ruiz.

But the conditions are dismal: There are only a dozen portable toilets and a couple of showers for everyone, leaving many to bathe in the Rio Grande river, which divides the two countries. Everything is caked in dust and mud.\n\n\n\nBoys play in the Rio Grande. Photo by Sergio Flores.\n\nA boy sits near the border crossing.

Hundreds marched onto the bridge that leads to Brownsville, Texas, and occupied it in protest of their treatment from the U.S. and Mexican governments.\n\n\n\nA local paper reported soon after that there were plans to evict the migrants Monday and move them to an event center six miles from the border, but the Texas Tribune reported Friday that a Matamoros spokeswoman said the plan had been scrapped. She said there were tentative plans to offer an alternate shelter closer to the bridge but that the migrants won\u2019t be forcibly removed.\n\nMigrants line up to receive donations of food and clothing.

Tamaulipas, the state home to Matamoros, is so dangerous that the U.S. government advises Americans not to travel there. Migrants are particular targets in cities across the borders, with kidnappings by the cartels shockingly commonplace.\n\n\n\nA move could also make it harder for the religious groups and legal teams that regularly cross the border to help migrants with their asylum claims and bring provisions like tents, clothing, and food.\n\nA woman keeps watch while her friend showers.

She was robbed of everything she had brought with her from Honduras, and because she is transgender, she was often verbally and physically harassed. Even at the border camp, \u201cI stay close to my friends. People have threatened to drown me in the river,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nPeople from \u201cvulnerable populations,\u201d such as transgender individuals, are excluded from Remain in Mexico on a case-by-case basis, and volunteer lawyers are trying to help Ruiz get to the U.S.\n\nA boy cries after being woken from a nap.
