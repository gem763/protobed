Other teams would have probably capitulated.\"\n\nVahaamahina had stunned the Welsh by bundling over from a lineout after just five minutes before France scored one of the tries of the tournament.\n\nRoared on by chants of \"Allez, Les Bleus!\" flanker Charles Ollivon stormed through to complete a sweeping move involving Virimi Vakatawa, Romain Ntamack and scrumhalf Antoine Dupont.\n\nBack came Wales in an electrifying opening 12 minutes as flanker Wainwright pounced on a loose ruck on halfway to race clear for his first Test try.\n\nBiggar slotted a penalty to bring the Six Nations champions to within two points.\n\nBut when a high tackle from substitute Ross Moriarty on Gael Fickou resulted in a yellow card, France made Wales pay as Damian Penaud released Vakatawa to grab France's third try on the half-hour mark.\n\nFrench playmaker Ntamack struck the post with a penalty just before the break but the pendulum swung towards Wales after Vahaamahina's rush of blood.\n\nCaught on camera recklessly swinging his elbow flush into Wainwright's face, it was only ever going to result in a red card.\n\nHis dismissal came as an ironic twist as then Welsh captain Sam Warburton received an early red card for a dangerous tip tackle on Vincent Clerc in that 2011 semi-final in Auckland.\n\nWales, who had won seven of their last eight games against France, were still made to work for it in a nail-biting finish.\n\nBut just when France looked like holding out for a famous victory, Moriarty popped up after a monster Welsh scrum.\n\nMaking up for his earlier indiscretion, the replacement forward bulldozed over six minutes from time before Biggar kicked the conversion that broke French hearts.\n\n\"I don't dispute the red card -- he made contact with the player's face,\" shrugged Brunel, who claimed there was a knock-on in the build-up to Moriarty's decisive try.\n\n\"But there were other decisions I didn't agree with -- I'd like to see those images again.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the semi-finals, Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones said: \"The days and weeks feel a little bit longer because of the magnitude of the occasion but we've been to some dark places in preparation for this.\"\n\nScorers:\n\nWales\n\nTry: Aaron Wainwright, Ross Moriarty\n\nConversions: Dan Biggar (2)\n\nPenalties: Bigger (2)\n\nFrance\n\nTries: Sebastien Vahaamahina, Charles Ollivon, Virimi Vakatawa\n\nConversions: Romain Ntamack (2)\n\nTeams:\n\nWales\n\n15 Liam Williams, 14 George North, 13 Owen Watkin, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Josh Adams, 10 Dan Biggar, 9 Gareth Davies, 8 Josh Navidi, 7 Justin Tipuric, 6 Aaron Wainwright, 5 Alun Wyn Jones (captain), 4 Jake Ball, 3 Tomas Francis, 2 Ken Owens, 1 Wyn Jones\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Dillon Lewis, 19 Adam Beard, 20 Ross Moriarty, 21 Tomos Williams, 22 Rhys Patchell, 23 Leigh Halfpenny\n\nFrance\n\n15 Maxime Medard, 14 Damian Penaud, 13 Virimi Vakatawa, 12 Gael Fickou, 11 Yoann Huget, 10 Romain Ntamack, 9 Antoine Dupont, 8 Gregory Alldritt, 7 Charles Ollivon, 6 Wenceslas Lauret, 5 Sebastien Vahaamahina, 4 Bernard Le Roux, 3 Rabah Slimani, 2 Guilhem Guirado (captain), 1 Jefferson Poirot\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Cyril Baille, 17 Camille Chat, 18 Emerick Setiano, 19 Paul Gabrillagues, 20 Louis Picamoles, 21 Baptiste Serin, 22 Camille Lopez, 23 Vincent Rattez", "description": "Wales took advantage of France being reduced to 14 men early in the second half to book their place in the semi-finals of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2871/373a2bc571ab4824a0cbcd4f77ef38b3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
