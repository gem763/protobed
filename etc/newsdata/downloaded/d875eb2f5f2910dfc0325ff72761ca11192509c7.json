Let's Explain", "language": "en", "text": "Image: Getty Images\n\nAn update in the Victorian Police Manual has given police officers the power to shoot and kill any drivers who are deliberately or recklessly risking the lives of others. It's the first state in Australia to grant these powers to officers in emergency situations. Here's what you need to know.\n\nPhone-Detecting Cameras: What NSW Drivers Need To Know The NSW Government recently announced it was introducing mobile phone detection cameras, which would be rolled out from late 2019 across the state. It's part of a plan to reduce fatalities by 30 per cent in two years and its trial has already been pretty effective. Here's what drivers in NSW - and other states - need to know.

Previously, only the Special Operations Group and Critical Incident Response Team were trained to use ramming techniques in these situations.\n\nLifehacker Australia has asked Victorian Police for access to the VPM and will update with further information once it responds.\n\nWhy now?\n\nVictoria has seen a number of high profile hostile vehicle attacks in recent years. In January 2017, a driver intentionally drove on footpaths in Melbourne's CBD, leaving six people killed and a further 27 injured. In a separate attack later that year in December, another driver deliberately ran a red light and hit crossing pedestrians on Flinders Street. This attack left one dead and 18 others injured.\n\nWhile bollards have been installed in many of high volume pedestrian areas in Melbourne and elsewhere, like Sydney's Martin Place, these changes are in response to bolstered efforts to prevent further attempts.\n\nWhat's considered 'deliberate' or 'reckless'?\n\nThis part is not clear without referring to the VPM but according to Sydney Morning Herald, the manual identifies three primary risk groups: terrorists mounting single or multi-vehicle attacks in crowded areas, mentally-ill offenders and criminals attempting to flee a scene, putting others at risk.\n\nWhile the first risk group is obvious, it's the second and third risk group that seems less clear. How police will determine whether someone is a mentally-ill offender or whether a fleeing criminal is putting the public at risk remains to be seen.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Shane Patton told The Age the new policy gives Victorian officers the power to act appropriately to violent attacks.\n\n\"We will not wait for offenders to plough into people. The instructions are that you must do something, that you must stop these attacks and that the response must be proportionate and justified,\" Patton said to The Age.\n\nLifehacker Australia has reached out to Victoria Police to confirm what's specified within the VPM.\n\nWho does this new policy really affect?\n\nLike any new law, it only really affects drivers doing an illegal action. But while the policy might be more clear cut against someone committing an act of terror and deliberately aiming to harm many people, it seems to be a bit more murky regarding opportunist carjackers or other lesser offences. Those acts are illegal in themselves but whether they would fall under the new hostile vehicle policy is important question to raise. A teenager going for a joyride, without intentionally trying to harm anyone, might be dangerous, but do they deserve to be shot and killed by the police too?\n\nHow Much Do Police Earn in Australia? Our state and territory police officers do one of the most challenging and dangerous jobs there is. One each shift, they don't know what they are going to face and they often work long hours on a rotating shift system. Do they earn a salary commensurate with those conditions? Here's a look at the salaries for police across the country.
