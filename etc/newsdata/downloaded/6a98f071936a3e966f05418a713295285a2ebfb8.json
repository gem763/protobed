Three years later, however, the government \u2014 which has grown increasingly resistant to genetic research and biotechnology over the years \u2014 declined to renew the funding, forcing the team to cobble together money from other sources. Mexico\u2019s agriculture ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cWe could have finished three years ago if we had the money to pay the people to do the analysis,\u201d Dr. Herrera-Estrella said.\n\nThe researchers also faced scientific hurdles. Unlike crops such as corn or maize, the avocado has a complex structure that makes it difficult to grow in a laboratory. To collect samples of the different varieties, Dr. Herrera-Estrella and his team had to travel to remote regions of Mexico, including areas where drug cartels control the local economy.\n\nAnalyzing the genetic material in those samples was like gluing together a document that had gone through a paper shredder, Dr. Herrera-Estrella said. Scientists extracted fragments of the genome from the various avocado samples \u2014 a string of code here, a few short sequences there \u2014 and then assembled those disparate pieces into a coherent whole.\n\n\u201cIf you have a 2,000-page book and someone has ripped it into small pieces, it\u2019s exactly the same as what we have to do,\u201d Dr. Herrera-Estrella said. \u201cYou start to assemble a phrase, then you have to assemble a paragraph, then you assemble a page.\u201d\n\nAfter the project got underway, advances in biotechnology made genome sequencing significantly less labor intensive, allowing the team to broaden its initial ambitions and sequence a couple of additional avocado varieties. A group of researchers in Mexico is now mapping the genomes of about a hundred more.\n\nWith those genetic maps, scientists will be able to analyze the differences among various types of avocados and identify particular segments of DNA that promote disease resistance or other desirable characteristics.", "description": "Scientists in the U.S. and Mexico have mapped the DNA of several varieties, work that could help the fruit survive the effects of climate change.", "authors": ["David Yaffe-Bellany"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/14/business/14avocado/merlin_159684030_9461426f-7520-4993-bcc6-703060a558ca-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
