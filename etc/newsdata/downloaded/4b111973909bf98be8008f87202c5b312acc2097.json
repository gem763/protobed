That fire killed 85 people, making it the deadliest in California\u2019s history.\n\nThe company had already filed for bankruptcy protection by then, citing potential liabilities of more than $30 billion from the Camp Fire and the 2017 North Bay Fires.\n\nConditions before the fires were about the same then as they are now in the region. Gale-force winds are expected to last through midday Thursday, with gusts up to 70 miles per hour, PG&E said. Humidity is low, leaving the air extremely dry.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said \u201cred-flag\u201d warnings were posted across the entire state for what was shaping up to be the strongest wind so far this season.\n\nConsequently, PG&E said on Tuesday it was extending a previously announced \u201cpublic safety power shutoff\u201d to 34 counties, more than half of all the counties in California. It\u2019s the largest such precautionary outage the utility has undertaken to date.\n\nOnce power is turned off, it cannot be restored until the winds subside, allowing the utility to inspect equipment for damage and make any repairs, PG&E said.\n\nThe first phase of the outages, affecting about 513,000 customers in northern California, began after midnight, PG&E said in an early morning release. Depending on the weather, additional outages will continue at noon, the company said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling customers to be prepared for an outage that could last several days,\u201d PG&E spokeswoman Tamar Sarkissian told Reuters.\n\nFILE PHOTO: PG&E crew work on power lines to repair damage caused by the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, U.S. November 21, 2018.

Some equipment locations will require workers to hike into remote or mountainous areas, she said.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of California homes and businesses started to lose electric power early Wednesday as part of an unprecedented effort by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to prevent wildfires, the utility said.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438790623&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980TN", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
