(AP) - Chuba Hubbard rushed for a career-high 256 yards and three touchdowns, and Oklahoma State defeated Tulsa 40-21 on Saturday afternoon.\n\nHubbard ripped off touchdown runs of 75 and 30 yards in the first four minutes of the game. His first score came on the first play from scrimmage, ten seconds into the game.\n\nThe Cowboys (3-0) opened up a 17-0 lead before Tulsa recovered. The Golden Hurricane took a 21-20 lead on a 1-yard touchdown run by Shamari Brooks late in the first half.\n\nOklahoma State star receiver Tylan Wallace was bottled up for much of the game, but he broke loose for a 90-yard touchdown reception late in the third quarter - the third longest scoring connection in school history - to give the Cowboys a 33-21 lead. He finished with five catches for 118 yards.\n\nIt was Oklahoma State\u2019s first game since billionaire booster T. Boone Pickens died on Wednesday. He donated more than $650 million to the school, and the football stadium is named for him. The Cowboys wore stickers with \u201cBoone\u201d on the back of their helmets in his honor.\n\nBrooks ran for 107 yards and two touchdowns and Keylon Stokes had seven catches for 109 yards and a score for Tulsa (1-2).\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nOklahoma State: The Cowboys learned that Hubbard can carry the team and that they can win without a dominant performance by Wallace. It was Hubbard\u2019s second game this season with at least 200 yards rushing - he had 227 yards against Oregon State in the opener.\n\nTulsa: The Golden Hurricane got overpowered in the second half and finally lost track of Wallace for the backbreaking touchdown in the third quarter. But the Golden Hurricane stood toe-to-toe with a solid Power Five team that was receiving Top 25 votes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOklahoma State will play at Texas on Saturday.\n\nTulsa will host Wyoming on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chuba Hubbard rushed for a career-high 256 yards and three touchdowns, and Oklahoma State defeated Tulsa 40-21 on Saturday afternoon.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cliff Brunt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/oklahoma_st_tulsa_football_32326_c0-84-2000-1250_s1770x1032.jpg?299aef161871dd3e8e2369fbee176c61f9e10561", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
