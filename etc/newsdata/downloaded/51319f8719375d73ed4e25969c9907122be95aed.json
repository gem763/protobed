He ended up pleading guilty to a misdemeanor count of \u201cAct in Manner to Injure Child,\u201d and was sentenced to six months.\n\nICE placed a detainer request on him, which requests deportation officers be notified before a release \u2014 and in some cases, that the target be held an additional period of time so officers can get there for pickup.\n\nBut the city released him in defiance of the request, ICE says.\n\nIn July he was arrested on a new set of sexual abuse charges, and ICE again requested a detainer. The city defied that one, too, ICE says.\n\nDeportation officers tracked him down Oct. 9 in South Richmond Hill, a neighborhood in Queens.\n\n\u201cHarrichand is a repeat offender when it comes to crimes against a child. Yet, he was released back into the community over and over,\u201d said Thomas R. Decker, director of deportation operations at the New York field office.\n\nNew York is one of the country\u2019s most prominent sanctuary cities, with Mayor Bill De Blasio, a Democratic presidential candidate, fiercely defending the policy against President Trump\u2019s threats.\n\nThe city won a court case last year to preserve its sanctuary policy, with a judge ruling the Justice Department couldn\u2019t withhold federal funds in order to force the city to surrender its policy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frightening that the city is more concerned about the release of a convicted criminal alien, who was ordered deported, than the victims of his crimes,\u201d Mr. Decker said.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE has begun a very public campaign to shame sanctuary cities over crimes committed by illegal immigrants that authorities have shielded from deportation.\n\nTwo murder cases in the Seattle area over the last few weeks have been tied back to illegal immigrant gang members who were shielded from deportation despite growing criminal records.\n\nAnd ICE blasted an Oklahoma sheriff\u2019s department for releasing an accused rapist.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s department responded that it alerted ICE to the 3 a.m. release, and nobody was on hand to take the illegal immigrant into custody. The department says it does not believe it has the legal authority to detain illegal immigrants on behalf of ICE.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
