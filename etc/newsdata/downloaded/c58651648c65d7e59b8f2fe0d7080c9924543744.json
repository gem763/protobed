Spellman often makes rounds to check up on such women. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nWith a bag of condoms and a stack of business cards, Tamika Spellman began a route she knew by heart, peering out the window of her Lincoln sedan at dark sidewalks where she once stood.\n\nWest Virginia Avenue. K Street. Eastern Avenue.\n\nStreet corners and alleyways where women wait for a steady trickle of clients, for quick cash to pay the rent. Spellman knows these streets, and these women, better than most: She used to be one of them.\n\nNow she was on a mission to help them, to help prevent the next black transgender woman from being killed at the fringes of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cHey love, you need condoms?\u201d Spellman called out the window. On the passenger side next to her sat Emmelia Talarico, a fellow advocate for sex-worker and transgender rights.\n\nIt was just past 11 p.m., at West Virginia Avenue in Northeast Washington. A tall, thin woman stood on the sidewalk, wearing a short red skirt and a white tank top. Like most of the women they see on these drives, Spellman and Talarico recognized her. Spellman passed her a card and told her to call if she needed anything.\n\n\u201cTry to work with somebody else,\u201d said Spellman, who by day works for the D.C. sex-worker advocacy group HIPS. \u201cI don\u2019t want y\u2019all walking by yourselves. It seems like they\u2019re escalating.\u201d\n\nFor transgender sex workers in the District, everything seems to be escalating. Threats to safety, police intimidation, rising rents that have pushed so many to take to the streets to survive.\n\nSpellman has been going on these drives every weekend since Zoe Spears, a black transgender woman, was shot and killed in June near the Eastern Avenue strip just outside the District, less than three months after another black transgender woman, Ashanti Carmon, was fatally shot blocks away.\n\nThe deaths became a local paragon of the dangers faced by transgender women of color across the country. At least 18 transgender people nationwide have been fatally shot or killed in 2019, according to the Human Rights Campaign; the American Medical Association has called violence against the transgender community an \u201cepidemic.\u201d\n\n[She had turned to sex work to survive. Then she was killed.]\n\nBut Spears and Carmon had something else in common: Both women had at some point in their lives turned to sex work, a dangerous profession that has over the past year become even riskier \u2014 especially for those who are black or brown or trans.\n\nFederal measures that shuttered websites like Backpage and Craigslist\u2019s personals eliminated a digital safety net that allowed sex workers to better control what clients they accepted. Instead, they have been forced onto the streets to find work.\n\nA controversial bill to legalize prostitution is gaining steam in Washington. But transgender sex workers can\u2019t afford to wait to see whether the District can find ways to better protect them.\n\nThey\u2019re doing it themselves.\n\nThey keep watch at night, organize rallies, collect money on GoFundMe to provide emergency housing and services. A group led by Talarico has given the homeless among them a place to live in Northeast Washington \u2014 a community that is now under threat.\n\nSpellman tore into a sticky pink Laffy Taffy from the pile of candy in the car\u2019s console. She needed sugar to keep her going until the early morning. Nicki Minaj blasted through the radio speakers. Talarico rolled down the window.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all got condoms?\u201d she called.\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nA year and a half ago, President Trump signed into law a pair of measures meant to cut down on illegal sex trafficking online. The bill \u2014 a combination of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) \u2014 made websites liable if users were found posting ads for prostitution on their pages.\n\nThe goal, to make policing the online sex trade easier, received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The bill\u2019s most immediate result, though, was that various websites, like Craigslist personals and Backpage, where sex workers could communicate with potential clients, vanished abruptly.\n\nSo, too, did business prospects for D.C. sex workers like Tiara Moten and Kim, who relied on those sites.\n\n\u201cWhen Backpage shut down, my phone stopped ringing,\u201d said Kim, who asked to be identified by only her first name because of pending criminal charges related to prostitution. Instead of coordinating dates from her home or hotel, she had to pick up clients on the streets.\n\nAdvocates with HIPS, which operates an outreach van along popular routes, said they have seen about three times more sex workers on the streets since the websites shut down.\n\nOnline, sex workers could better vet clients. They could check social media, coordinate a place to meet, even set up a GPS tracker with their friends. They had the power to set their own prices and offer only the services with which they were comfortable, many said. It made an unsafe profession feel somewhat safer.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in that car, in their car, they have the ball, it\u2019s in their court,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSex workers aren\u2019t the only ones who say losing these websites has made their jobs harder. It has become more difficult for police to investigate and monitor sex trafficking, D.C. Police Lt. Brett Parson said. In the past, investigators could build a case against traffickers using an ad posted online. The main websites, he said, were generally cooperative with law enforcement subpoenas.\n\nNow, the online commercial sex trade has moved into lesser-known corners of the Web, on sites not based in the United States. That means law enforcement subpoena powers are limited, Parson said.\n\n[FBI targets prostitution bosses in busy D.C. zone called \u2018the Blade\u2019]\n\n\n\nThe office of HIPS, a D.C. sex-worker advocacy group, on H Street NE. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nEven some organizations that aid victims of sex trafficking have found that the closure of these sites has made outreach harder.\n\nIn June, D.C. Council member David Grosso (I-At large) introduced a bill that he said would bring sex workers \u201cout of the shadows,\u201d improving public safety. It would make the District the only U.S. jurisdiction to legalize prostitution, outside of some areas of Nevada, where legal brothels exist.\n\nGrosso\u2019s decriminalization effort failed in 2017, the last time he introduced the idea to the council. But he\u2019s more optimistic now, with several of his fellow council members signing on as co-sponsors of the legislation.\n\n\u201cRight now the issue is everything that happens in that world is done underground, in the shadows, where criminals tend to be, where people who think they can get away with assault and murder go to,\u201d Grosso said.\n\nHe and his supporters have said the bill would make it easier for sex workers to find housing and leave the industry because they would not have prostitution-related arrests on their records.\n\nOpponents of the legislation argue that it would put more women at risk of exploitation and abuse, and turn the nation\u2019s capital into a red-light district.\n\nTina Frundt, founder of Courtney\u2019s House, which provides services to underage survivors of sex trafficking, said she supports partial decriminalization efforts that protect sex workers from being charged with crimes. But, she argues, Grosso\u2019s full decriminalization bill would embolden pimps and increase trafficking.\n\nGrosso rejects the idea that the bill would legalize pimps or any kind of coercion in the sex trade.\n\n\u201cMy law only addresses sex work when it\u2019s a noncoercive situation between two consensual adults,\u201d Grosso said. \u201cBringing that out of the shadows will actually make it easier to identify and stop trafficking.\u201d\n\nAt a rally introducing his bill in June, Grosso handed the microphone to activist and sex worker Shareese Mone. Her eyes welled as she recalled the time she was kidnapped, how she was gagged and tied and left for dead.\n\nAs she spoke, two black trans women nodded knowingly, holding hands in the back row.\n\n\n\nEmmelia Talarico of No Justice No Pride is shown out of the New York Avenue Low Barrier Shelter, a men\u2019s shelter that refused to admit Keisha So\u2019Fierce Allen, who had recently started identifying as a woman. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nA safe house\n\nTurning a corner in the NoMa neighborhood, blocks from Union Station, Talarico spotted two women she knew. One wore a suede skirt and a transparent crop top, the other a sports bra and leggings.\n\n\u201cAyy, what are y\u2019all doing?\u201d Talarico said.\n\n\u201cTrying to make a living,\u201d one replied.\n\n\u201cWhen y\u2019all out here, y\u2019all work in pairs,\u201d Spellman added.\n\n\u201cThey already know,\u201d Talarico said. \u201cShe\u2019s an NJNP girl.\u201d\n\nTalarico recognized her as one of nearly 30 transgender women of color who have spent all or part of the past year living in a Northeast Washington safe house run by the activist group No Justice No Pride.\n\nIt began as a quick fix.\n\nAfter FOSTA/SESTA passed and the websites closed down, Talarico\u2019s phone exploded with desperate messages from trans sex workers in need of a place to stay. They were short on rent. They couldn\u2019t afford hotel fees. They were running out of options.\n\nA longtime community organizer, Talarico offered her own home to half a dozen women to start, then got to work raising enough money to rent a rowhouse. They landed in a five-bedroom, four-bathroom place in Eckington and relied on donations to make the $4,250 monthly rent.\n\nAbout eight trans women of color moved in right away. More followed. The house quickly turned into a teeming hub of activity.\n\nFamily dinner nights meant voguing in the kitchen. Impassioned debates over Beyonc\u00e9 and Disney films crackled with jokes and jabs. The space was, above all, a place where black and brown trans women could feel free to be themselves, to feel safe, to burst up from their chairs and dance.\n\n[Police investigating \u2018possible hate crime\u2019 after transgender woman assaulted]\n\nBefore she moved into an upstairs bedroom in the NJNP house, Kim was in and out of homelessness for years. She fell into sex work when she was 18, after losing her job. The more she worked, the harder it became to quit. Prostitution charges kept her from finding a new job.\n\nMoten, 18, was one of the first women to move in. After a troubled childhood and a family that struggled to accept her transition, she set out on her own.\n\nSex work, she said, helped her gain independence. But Moten is young enough to have known sex work only in its online form. Like others whose primary client base existed on the Web, she estimates that her income has been cut by as much as 80 percent since Backpage and Craigslist closed. Using Backpage, most women could make about $300 a night. On the street, many said, they earn about $60.\n\nAt the end of August, the place where these women had created a no-judgment community was taken away. Their landlord declined to renew NJNP\u2019s lease. The group has yet to find a new home.\n\n\n\nFrom left, Emmelia Talarico, Bianca Bonita Carter and Tamika Spellman cruise the streets checking up on sex workers in the early-morning hours in Northeast Washington. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\n'Where the dates come to kill'\n\nJust before midnight, veering through a dark residential neighborhood near K and 12th streets NE, Spellman lit a cigarette. Talarico looked out the window and pointed out a corner.\n\n\u201cThis is my spot, right here,\u201d Talarico said. \u201cI drop the kiddies off . . . then I come back by myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s not safe these days,\u201d Spellman told her.\n\nOn nights when Spellman and her car don\u2019t patrol the District\u2019s streets, Talarico walks the line of women waiting on corners, making sure everyone has condoms, a buddy, a place to stay. She uses the Find My iPhone app to keep track of \u201ckiddies\u201d like Moten and other women from the NJNP house.\n\nThe street darkened as the women wrapped around the District to Eastern Avenue, blocks from where Spears and Ashanti were gunned down.\n\nBack when she still worked the streets, Spellman avoided Eastern Avenue at all costs.\n\n\u201cThis is just known to be the beat where the dates come to kill the girls,\u201d Talarico said.\n\nNow the street reminds Spellman of the last place she saw Spears alive. It was early one morning, and Spears had a date \u201ctrailing her,\u201d Spellman said. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to her right now, she\u2019s busy,\u201d she remembered thinking.\n\nShe kept driving. On the corner of 51st and Meade street, they found a woman wearing a pink tank top and a fanny pack. Spellman offered her condoms.\n\n\u201cI just want to make sure you\u2019re safe while you\u2019re working,\u201d said Spellman.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I question them before getting in the car,\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cI know, but you can\u2019t never tell these days,\u201d Spellman said. \u201cToo many other girls have been killed, and I just want to make sure you out here being safe, sugar.\u201d\n\nAs Spellman pulled away, a white sedan pulled up on the opposite side of the street.
