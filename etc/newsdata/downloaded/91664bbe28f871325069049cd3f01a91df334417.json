But we don\u2019t, not really. How could we? How could I, a white middle-aged man in 2019, truly know the horror of human bondage and the fierce dignity it took for some to survive it? Coates\u2019 first novel dazzles with a story firmly grounded in the harsh realities of slavery, yet elevated by a modicum of mysticism.\n\nOur narrator is Hiram Walker - \u201cHi\u201d for short - a slave at the Lockless tobacco plantation in Virginia. His mother was sold off when he was young and he can barely remember her. His father is the master of the estate, putting young Hiram in a unique position. He moves easily between the house, where he tends to his white stepbrother, Maynard, to the Street, where the slaves live in relative squalor.\n\nThe novel opens with a remarkable paragraph - just one sentence, actually - that sets the tone for all that is to come. Hiram imagines his mother on a bridge, \u201ca dancer wreathed in ghostly blue \u2026 back when the Virginia earth was still red as brick and red with life,\u201d bound and headed for the turnpike \u201cthrough the green hills and down the valley before bending in one direction, and that direction was south.\u201d\n\nThat single image drives the story, as Hiram looks back on his life and tries to make sense of it. Coates unspools his narrator\u2019s past mostly chronologically, from when Lockless was a booming plantation to when the fields go fallow and the masters are desperate to wring every last ounce of profit from the land.\n\nWhen he moves up to the house as a pre-teen to be Maynard\u2019s man-servant, Hiram clearly sees the difference between the Tasked and the Quality, as he frequently refers to the slaves and their owners. \u201cThe masters could not bring water to boil, harness a horse, nor strap their own drawers without us,\u201d writes Coates. \u201cWe were better than them - we had to be. Sloth was literal death for us, while for them it was the whole ambition of their lives.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that belief in exceptionalism that powers Hiram\u2019s journey. That and his remarkable memory. When he\u2019s young he plays parlor games with the Quality, memorizing cards after just once glance, but as he grows up and finds he can recount any story ever told to him, he must figure out how to harness that power and eventually use it to attempt escape.\n\nI\u2019m reluctant to say much more. Suffice it to say that Harriet Tubman shows up and the Underground Railroad figures prominently, if not exactly as you read about it in history class. But this is a book that needs to be experienced. Readers need to find a quiet place and lose themselves in it, letting Coates\u2019 words work their magic as he tells a tale about \u201cthe awesome power of memory \u2026 how it can open a blue door from one world to another.\u201d It\u2019s a remarkable debut novel that reminds us in a fresh way why it\u2019s so important we remember all of humanity\u2019s stories - from the depraved to the glorious. Or as Coates puts it in the voice of Tubman: \u201cTo forget is to truly slave. To forget is to die.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"The Water Dancer\" (One World), by Ta-Nehisi Coates", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Merrill"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/book_review_-_the_water_dancer_53205_c0-878-1875-1971_s1770x1032.jpg?74d9889e760849ad24e1a9344ac67f54e81798b1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
