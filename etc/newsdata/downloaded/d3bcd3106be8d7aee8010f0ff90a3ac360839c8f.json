REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo\n\nLOD, Israel (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged world powers on Thursday not to open a dialogue with Iran, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he may meet his Iranian counterpart to resolve a crisis over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme and sanctions against it.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time to hold talks with Iran. This is the time to increase the pressure on Iran,\u201d Netanyahu told reporters at Ben Gurion Airport before boarding a flight to London.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s comments marked rare public discord between the right-wing Israeli leader and Trump on the Iranian nuclear issue. Netanyahu had previously counselled France against its own outreach to Iran.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump left the door open to a possible meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly in New York, saying: \u201cAnything\u2019s possible. They would like to be able to solve their problem.\u201d\n\nTehran has rejected any negotiations with Washington unless Trump drops sanctions he imposed after withdrawing from the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, an agreement Netanyahu also opposed.\n\nIran has said that, starting on Friday, it would begin developing centrifuges to speed up the enrichment of uranium, which can produce fuel for power plants or for atomic bombs. The Iranians deny seeking the latter.\n\nThe centrifuge move would be Iran\u2019s latest reduction of its commitments to restrict nuclear projects under the 2015 deal.\n\nNetanyahu called this \u201canother violation, another provocation by Iran, this time in the realm of its quest for nuclear weaponry\u201d.\n\nIn London, Netanyahu is due to meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged world powers on Thursday not to open a dialogue with Iran, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he may meet his Iranian counterpart to resolve a crisis over Tehran's nuclear programme and sanctions against it.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426444534&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840HW", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
