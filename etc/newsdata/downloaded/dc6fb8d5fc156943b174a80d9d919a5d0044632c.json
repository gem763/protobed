REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nJavid, in his first major speech since taking over the public purse strings in July, will promise more money for what he says are \u201cthe people\u2019s priorities\u201d - education, health and the police - after a decade of tight spending controls that has frustrated voters.\n\nJohnson has promised the \u201cmost ambitious spending round for more than a decade\u201d although Javid, a former Deutsche Bank managing director, says he will stick to the fiscal rules of his predecessor, at least for Wednesday\u2019s one-year spending plan.\n\nJavid\u2019s spending round speech in parliament, expected around 1200 GMT, will go ahead as planned despite lawmakers opposed to a no-deal Brexit taking control of the legislature\u2019s agenda during the day, government officials said.\n\nJohnson said late on Tuesday that an election would be the only way to resolve the parliamentary impasse over Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, if lawmakers vote to force him to seek a delay to Brexit.\n\nJavid has a bit of room to increase borrowing to fund his planned spending increases because Britain has cut its budget deficit from almost 10% of gross domestic product in 2010 to just over 1% now.\n\nBut he could end up weakening Britain\u2019s budget credibility by making big spending pledges at a time when the economy is at risk of recession and the outcome of Brexit remains so unclear, analysts have warned.\n\n\u201cMaking big fiscal announcements in a period of great economic uncertainty means we will have little idea how sustainable or costly decisions made this week will be,\u201d Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, said earlier this week.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation, another think tank, said the weak economy, a recent rise in public borrowing and Johnson\u2019s spending promises meant the Treasury was already set to break one of the fiscal rules that Javid has said he will honour - keeping borrowing below 2% of gross domestic product next year.\n\nPromises of tax cuts made by Johnson could mean a bigger breach of the rule, it said.\n\nAnother budget rule commits Britain to bring down debt as a share of economic output each year.\n\nJavid has said he will consider changing the fiscal rules to allow for more borrowing when he delivers a longer-term budget statement later this year, probably after the scheduled Oct. 31 Brexit date, when Britain\u2019s economic outlook might be clearer.\n\nJohnson said last week he would boost funding for schools over the next three years by more than 14 billion pounds, reversing an 8% inflation-adjusted fall in spending per pupil over the last 10 years by the 2022/23 financial year.\n\nHe has also promised to hire 20,000 extra police officers and upgrade 20 hospitals.\n\nJavid said late on Tuesday that he was earmarking 2 billion pounds for spending on Brexit-related projects in the 2020/21 financial year, such as supporting Britain\u2019s Border Force and the country\u2019s ports.\n\nAs well as his announcing spending plan on Wednesday, Javid is also due to respond to a call by lawmakers for Britain to stop issuing inflation-linked debt linked to an outdated price measure that give bondholders an annual 1 billion-pound ($1.2 billion) windfall.", "description": "British finance minister Sajid Javid will announce increases in public spending on Wednesday, preparing the ground for a possible snap election call by Prime Minister Boris Johnson who is seeking a way to break resistance to his Brexit plans.", "authors": ["William Schomberg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425937844&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8225C"}
