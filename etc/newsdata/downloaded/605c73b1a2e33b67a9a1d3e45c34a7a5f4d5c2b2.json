The Class of 2010, which graduated shortly after the recession ended, was even worse off: only 9% of their balances had been repaid five years after graduating.\n\nStudent loan debt passed $1.6 trillion in the three months to June, boosting total household debt excluding mortgages to a record $4.1 trillion in August.\n\n\u201cSlow repayment has long-lasting consequences,\u201d the Fed said in the report. For example, higher student debt balances are associated with lower rates of homeownership among college graduates, according to a 2017 New York Fed study.\n\nThe average balance per student-loan borrower grew about 5% per year in the decade since 2008, outpacing a rise in tuition costs, the Fed said.\n\nAbout 43 million people carry student debt and the average amount is $33,500, although the median balance is under $18,000, the Fed said.\n\nA third of borrowers owe less than $10,000 while a staggering 7%, equating to 3 million people, have balances of $100,000 or more in education debt.\n\nAbout 15% of borrowers with loans in a repayment cycle were 90 or more days past due or in default in the second quarter.\n\nNot included in the Fed study were loans currently in deferment because the student is still attending school, in grace periods mostly due to a recent graduation, or in forbearance. That could mean the delinquency rate is even worse.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Virginia Van Natta in San Francisco at vvannatta@bloomberg.net;Alex Tanzi in Washington at atanzi@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Linus Chua at lchua@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny, Steve Geimann\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
