Potential problems could be brewing", "language": "en", "text": "Chances are good that you haven't thought much about the safety of your bank deposits lately. Most of the time, like now, it's just business as usual for financial institutions.\n\nBut when banks get into massive trouble, lots of bad things happen. Just think back to the last recession, when hundreds of financial institutions failed and depositors worried about the safety of their money. That's why it's good to review the basics of deposit insurance now and then \u2014 just in case.\n\nThere is a potential problem brewing now because banks are finding it harder to make money on the spread between what they earn on loans and pay on deposits, and this pressure from low interest rates could worsen.\n\n\"With the recent lowering of short-term interest rates and inversion of the yield curve in the second quarter, new challenges for banks in lending and funding may emerge,\" warned Jelena McWilliams, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\n401(k) lawsuits are rising: Why so many workers sue their employers over savings plan\n\nWhat you should know about bonds: Prices riding 38-year run but won't defy gravity forever\n\nIf the economy slipped into recession, that too would cause problems for banks.\n\nBut we're not there yet, and the economy, while slowing, remains on a growth path.\n\nFor now, safety concerns are deep on the back burner. The number of problem banks, 56, recently dropped to its lowest quarterly level since early 2007, back when the Great Recession was just getting started. Bank profits are up, problem loans way down and the industry has shown improvement and resiliency in other ways.\n\nOf special note, giant banks likely would be able to continue lending and maintain operations in a severe recession, thanks to large accumulations of capital, the Federal Reserve said in its latest stress-test announcement.\n\n\"The nation's largest banks are significantly stronger than before the crisis and would be well-positioned to support the economy even after a severe shock,\" said Randal Quarles, a Fed vice chairman, in a prepared statement.\n\nYields are down, deposits are up\n\nPlus, depositors have remained loyal. The public now holds a record $7.7 trillion in insured deposits even though yields have dropped by more than half over the past decade. Consumers have grudgingly accepted the low payouts. They continue to rate their banks highly for overall satisfaction, according to an American Bankers Association survey last October.\n\nJavier Rodriguez Soler, president and CEO of BBVA USA, a bank operating in Arizona and other Sunbelt states, said what keeps him up at night isn't recession risks or bank-safety concerns but attracting more clients.\n\nDuring an interview in Phoenix last month, Soler said the industry has become stronger and more prudent over the past decade or so. He predicted that the next recession, when it comes, will be mild and not a serious threat.\n\nMore federal insurance backs deposits\n\nFDIC deposit insurance, a key buffer that gives confidence to consumers in good times and bad, is in much better shape than it had been.\n\nThis fund now holds a record $107 billion, enough to cover 1.4% of insured deposits. The ratio fell below 0% in 2009 and 2010, when nearly 300 banks failed. When the fund is too low, the FDIC calls on healthy banks to ante up more money through higher insurance premiums. Insurance is a federal guarantee, so the FDIC can borrow from the government in a pinch.\n\nAs for failures, just one bank has gone under since the end of 2017. Nearly all of the nation's banks are insured by the FDIC, as are nearly all credit unions, which are covered by a separate but similar agency, the National Credit Union Administration.\n\nYou can insure more than $250,000\n\nThe FDIC's basic coverage amount is up to $250,000 per person per bank, but you could hold more than $250,000 at a particular bank and still be covered, such as if you also have a joint account or certain types of retirement accounts.\n\nIn short, your coverage could exceed $250,000, depending on how your accounts are owned. The FDIC provides specific examples of titling nuances under the \"deposit insurance\" section on its website, fdic.gov, or here.\n\nIf you're fortunate enough to have deposits that exceed $250,000 but are concerned about coverage, you can extend it by spreading your money among different banks. The $250,000 limit also applies at credit unions.\n\nStory continues", "description": "This FDIC fund now holds a record $107 billion, enough to cover 1.4% of insured deposits.
