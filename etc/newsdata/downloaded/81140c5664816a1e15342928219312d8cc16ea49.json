Created by Sam Shaw and Dustin Thomason and executive produced by J.J. Abrams and Stephen King, among others, the show is set in the fictional Maine town of Castle Rock, which is the setting for many King stories. Castle Rock incorporates elements from King\u2019s fiction, but it leaves the novels that made the town famous largely untouched, apart from the occasional passing reference to the town\u2019s history with killer dogs and serial killers.\n\nThe series isn\u2019t King\u2019s work, but it\u2019s storytelling that aspires to be on King\u2019s unmistakable wavelength. It\u2019s hard to think that this approach would work for many other authors. You could set, say, a legal procedural in the American South and load it with Easter eggs referencing John Grisham\u2019s work, but is there a Grisham feeling to imitate? If so, could it be sustained over the length of a TV season?\n\nThe King vibe resonated throughout Castle Rock\u2019s first season, which brought in one recurring King character (Alan Pangborn, the town\u2019s retired sheriff, played by Scott Glenn) and landmark King locations like Shawshank Prison, all in service of a story about a mysterious prisoner whose release upends the lives of several Castle Rock residents. The vibe also remains strong in the first half of the series\u2019s second season, a slow-burning mystery where supernatural elements recede into the background for long stretches, then reappear in shocking moments. (Hulu provided critics with five of the second season\u2019s 10 episodes.)\n\nStarting over with an all-new cast, season 2 draws heavily from two of King\u2019s best-known novels, but it often references them to subvert fan expectations. The first episode, \u201cLet the River Run,\u201d opens with a blood-soaked teen carrying a box to the edge of a lake. Then, the same character \u2014 now a little older and played by Lizzy Caplan \u2014 engages in a multiyear, cross-country ramble with her daughter Joy (Elsie Fisher), taking a series of nursing jobs that invariably end with her loading up on stolen meds, swapping out one set of license plates for another, and moving on to the next town. Her name: Annie Wilkes, the writer-entrapping protagonist of Misery. As her journey draws to a close, an accident ensures she\u2019ll end up spending more time than planned in Castle Rock, Maine, and in the neighboring town of Jerusalem\u2019s Lot, which is the setting of King\u2019s 1975 vampire novel \u2019Salem\u2019s Lot.\n\nCastle Rock has bigger plans than merely mashing up two well-known King novels, however. The second season wants to explore parts of Castle Rock that viewers have never seen before. Much of this involves the not-quite-legal enterprises of Reginald \u201cPop\u201d Merrill (Tim Robbins, taking over the \u201cCastle Rock actor who appeared in a famous King film adaptation\u201d slot from Sissy Spacek in season 1). Pop owns the Emporium Galorium hardware store, and he\u2019s the driving force behind much of the town\u2019s shady business. (The character previously appeared in King\u2019s novella The Sun Dog.)\n\nPop has raised four children, none of them his biological offspring. Two are his adopted nephews: the violent-tempered John, better known as \u201cAce\u201d (Paul Sparks), and Ace\u2019s mild-mannered brother Chris (Matthew Alan). The others, Abdi (Barkhad Abdi) and Nadia (Yusra Warsama), are Somali refugees he took in as teens. As adults, Nadia is a doctor, while Abdi is preparing to build a new shopping complex catering to the town\u2019s Somali population, a growing demographic that\u2019s been a source of tension among the town\u2019s more close-minded longtime residents. Abdi\u2019s time learning the business from Pop has an expiration date, however: Pop is suffering from cancer that chemo doesn\u2019t seem able to beat.\n\nFor long stretches, Castle Rock is more focused on exploring the working-class realist side of King\u2019s fiction than the side that produces, say, malevolent spirits shaped like evil clowns. Annie and Joy settle into low-rent housing run by Ace, offering glimpses of life on the economic fringes. Annie\u2019s false identity \u2014 she\u2019s fleeing a past that isn\u2019t fully revealed until mid-season \u2014 cuts off her ability to get treatment for mental illness, compelling her to find ways to steal the medication she needs to keep her visions and voices at bay. The series\u2019s excursions into the Somali immigrant community are even more compelling, exploring an aspect of small-town American life rarely depicted on television or in King\u2019s fiction.\n\nBut Shaw, Thomason, and the writers haven\u2019t forgotten that King\u2019s Castle Rock stories are best known for finding horror just beneath the surface of small-town life. They also haven\u2019t forgotten the stories that inspired the show; they just aren\u2019t entirely beholden to them. Characters disappear then reappear with a newfound sense of purpose, comings and goings that have something to do with the spooky, ancient Marsten House that overlooks Jerusalem\u2019s Lot and Abdi\u2019s new development. Then there\u2019s Annie, who seems always on the verge of snapping.\n\nCastle Rock, and Caplan\u2019s vivid, wild-eyed performance, pay homage to the familiar aspects of Misery as a book and film, including Kathy Bates\u2019 unforgettable take on the character. But Annie\u2019s fate still doesn\u2019t seem preordained. (For starters, the series is set in present day, making it not-quite but not-quite-not a Misery prequel.) Meanwhile, whatever\u2019s happening at the Marsten House seems monstrous but free of bloodsucking \u2014 at least for now. (Another nod: one episode plays in part like a truncated version of \u201cThe Body,\u201d the King story that inspired Stand by Me.)\n\nThis is the world King\u2019s fans know and more. At times, it can feel like too much more. The first half of the season has to do a lot of work just to establish all of the players, their pasts, and their relationship to various aspects of Castle Rock and Jerusalem\u2019s Lot life. Some of these episodes forget about whole groups of characters while turning their focus elsewhere. It\u2019s a lot of setup that will have to cohere in the second half of the season in order to pay off, but it\u2019s compelling enough to make it worth seeing where it all leads. Even if it leads nowhere \u2014 and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first King or King-adjacent project to whiff the payoff \u2014 or fails to produce an episode as strong as season 1\u2019s Spacek-spotlight \u201cThe Queen,\u201d Castle Rock remains an atmospheric, grippingly acted series that captures the feeling of King\u2019s fiction while exploring corners of his world that even he might not have imagined existing.", "description": "Season 2 of Hulu\u2019s Stephen King-derived series Castle Rock touches on some familiar King books, including Jerusalem\u2019s Lot and Misery.
