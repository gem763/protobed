There will then be another vote immediately afterward on his proposed fast-track timetable for passing the law.\n\nFollow developments as they happen here. All times U.K.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nCommons now debating the so-called second reading of the Brexit bill -- essentially the general principle of the agreementPrime Minister Boris Johnson opens the debate, saying a vote for his deal will unleash a \u201ctide\u201d of investment into BritainHouse of Commons votes on the second reading at 7 p.m. and then immediately on the proposed fast-track timetableThe pound fell by as much as 0.5% to $1.2891, a fresh low for the day after news that Johnson would abandon his Brexit deal law and push for an election if defeated on the parliamentary timetable for his bill.\n\nLoyalists in Northern Ireland Say Deal Is Surrender (2:10 p.m.)\n\nEveryone is familiar with the risks that a hard border might pose to peace on the island of Ireland. But loyalists in the north are warning that the deal Johnson thrashed out with the EU might also prompt a furious backlash.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have an organic explosion of anger\u201d if the deal is passed, Jamie Bryson, who has emerged as a de-facto spokesman for loyalists, said in an interview. \u201cYou are asking people to go along with surrendering their country -- it is not going to happen. It\u2019s a very fluid situation and it wouldn\u2019t take much to spark it off.\u201d\n\nKinnock Proposes Single Market Amendment (2 p.m.)\n\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock proposed an amendment to the bill which seeks to ensure the U.K. stays aligned with the EU single market after it\u2019s left the EU.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Kinnock said businesses have raised concerns that the EU would never do a free trade deal with a country that had diverged from its rules and regulations to become \u201cSingapore on Thames.\u201d\n\nThe amendment proposes the government will work towards close alignment with the single market, \u201cdynamic\u201d rights and protections for workers and the environment, and to participate in EU agencies.\n\nKinnock said the amendment has been proposed for debate and potentially voting on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nPM \u2018Will Ditch Bill\u2019 if Defeated on Timetable (1:45 p.m.)\n\nThe prime minister may have the votes to get his deal approved but faces a major battle to convince MPs to rush the law through Parliament in just a few days. If they refuse his request for a speedy timetable, Johnson has little chance of meeting his goal of getting Brexit done by Oct. 31.\n\nThe premier\u2019s team hit back, with one senior government official in Johnson\u2019s office saying he will abandon the bill entirely if he loses the vote on the fast-track timetable motion on Tuesday.\n\nThe official said the prime minister will ditch the bill if Parliament votes again for a delay and the EU offers an extension to the Brexit deadline to Jan. 31. The official said the government will pull the Bill, there will be no further business for Parliament, and the Johnson will move to trigger an election before Christmas.\n\nThe official\u2019s comments may put more pressure on MPs to agree to the accelerated timetable ahead of the vote. The pound fell by as much as 0.5% to $1.2891, a fresh low for the day.\n\nJohnson: Back Brexit Deal to \u2018Heal\u2019 Britain (1:30 p.m.)\n\nJohnson opened the debate in Parliament on his deal, calling on MPs of all parties to back his Withdrawal Agreement Bill so that voters can focus on domestic priorities instead of Brexit.\n\nPassing the bill later Tuesday will allow the nation to \u201cturn the page and allow this parliament and this country to heal,\u201d Johnson said. A vote to support the new Brexit agreement would provide a \u201cshot in the arm\u201d for the British economy and unleash a \u201ctide\u201d of investment, he said. The premier was replying to a question on why the government hasn\u2019t provided economic impact assessments of his deal.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will scrap his attempt to pass a Brexit deal and move straight to an election, if lawmakers defeat him tonight and vote for another delay, a senior official said.The premier will", "authors": ["Kitty Donaldson", "Jessica Shankleman", "Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7ITzwQZHOgXKdD9AY5YVbQ--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/4ab6870788d718a1a94c94cccc433807", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
