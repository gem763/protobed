This includes companies that help China maintain its totalitarian \u201csocial credit\u201d system, violate U.S. and international sanctions, illegally develop disputed islands in the South China Sea, and improve its military capabilities with advanced weapons.\n\n\u201cToday, such Chinese companies are being underwritten \u2013 in many cases unwittingly \u2013 by American pension funds and other institutional and individual investors,\u201d the letter noted. \u201cThere is at least $6 trillion that investors passively invest in the benchmarked Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) All-Country World Index, which has 6% of its portfolio (shortly going to 7% or another $60 billion) invested in the stocks of Communist China\u2019s corporations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse yet, the federal retirement system\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan is set up to mirror this MSCI index starting next year,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cIf that happens, U.S. government employees \u2013 past and present, military and civilian \u2013 risk having their pension funds underwrite the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s malevolent enterprises.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is especially intolerable to those of us who have proudly served the Nation in uniform that our retirement investments will help its enemies threaten our comrades-in-arms and the country we love,\u201d the signatories declared.\n\n\u201cWe call on President Trump to prevent the Thrift Savings Plan from being tapped by companies tied to the Chinese Communist Party and thereby ensure that federal retirees will not wind up financing our foes,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe letter was signed by retired veterans U.S. Army Lt. Gen. William \u201cJerry\u201d Boykin, U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding, Lt. Col. Allen West, Col. Darrell Smith, and Gunnery Sgt. Jessie Jane Duff. West is also a former member of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe authors of the letter are not alone in asking the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) to refrain from investing in Chinese companies. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) published a similar appeal at CNBC on September 30, noting that it would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d to compel American military personnel and government employees to invest in Soviet companies during the Cold War.\n\nRubio and Shaheen\u2019s article named several of the companies to which Boykin, McInerney, and their fellow signatories alluded, including surveillance technology firm Hikvision, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, and telecom corporation ZTE.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s investors should never be a source of wealth funding the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of our nation\u2019s future prosperity,\u201d the senators declared.\n\nRubio and Shaheen wrote a letter of their own to FRTIB chairman Michael Kennedy in late August, asking him to reverse the decision to invest in Chinese enterprises and explain how that decision was originally reached.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently considering restrictions on investment portfolio money flowing into China, prominently including the portfolios of U.S. government retirement funds. The Chinese government has indicated such a move would disrupt trade talks and prompt Beijing to retaliate.", "description": "A group of prominent military veterans wrote a letter on Monday urging the federal government not to invest retirement plan money in China.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/china-xi-jinping-military-camo-pla-nov-2017-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
