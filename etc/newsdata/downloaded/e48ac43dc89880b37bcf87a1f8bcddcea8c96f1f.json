He was one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names, but this would perhaps be the role he would be remembered most for - accused of fatally shooting his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, three years prior outside a popular restaurant in Los Angeles.\n\nBlake was acquitted in 2005, but the outcome of the event left Bakley\u2019s children mother-less and the damage done to his family was irreparable.\n\nCaught in the crosshairs of the legal battle and media frenzy of it all was the couple\u2019s baby daughter, Rose Lenore.\n\nNow nearly two decades later, Lenore -- now 19-years-old -- is opening up in People magazine for the first time to \u201cset the story straight\u201d about the Hollywood murder mystery that tore her family apart.\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cI felt a bit like there were two parts of me,\u201d she told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cOne of them is, you know, trying to kind of recover from what happened when I was young and trying to sort through the complicated family that I have. And then one of them is just a normal teenage girl.\u201d\n\nBlake met Bonny Lee Bakely at a jazz club in 1999. Bakley ran a lonely hearts business and was involved with Christian Brando, son of actor Marlon Brando, when she met Blake.\n\nIn June 2000, the two had Lenore -- whom they nicknamed \u201cRosie\u201d -- and married November of that same year. It was Blake\u2019s second marriage, but Bakley had been married multiple times.\n\nThings took a turn for the couple on May 4, 2001, when the two had dinner at Blake\u2019s favorite restaurant, Vitello\u2019s, in Studio City, California. Blake told police that they were walking to the car when he had to suddenly go back into the restaurant to grab a gun he had left at the table.\n\nWhen he came back out, Blake said that he found Bakley sitting in their car with two gunshot wounds.\n\nPolice considered several potential suspects, including Christian Brando and other men Bakley had been in contact with, but zeroed in on Blake and arrested him. He was charged with murder and solicitation of murder and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nLenore was just 11 months old when the trial began for her father. When it happened, her life changed immediately.\n\nWireImage/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u201cRobert\u2019s daughter with a former wife eventually legally adopted her,\u201d said Alicia Dennis, senior editor of People. \u201cThey formed this family unit where Rose called them mom and dad.\u201d\n\nBut life wasn\u2019t always easy for Lenore, who suffered from depression and anxiety growing up.\n\nEighteen years after her mother\u2019s murder, Lenore said she was finally ready to confront her past and reached out to Blake this past summer. She\u2019s even visited her mother\u2019s grave for the first time ever over the past year.\n\nThe 19-year-old said that she and her father talked about old memories of her as a child and went through old photographs from her birthday parties.\n\nBut on the topic of the trial and her father\u2019s murder, she said she didn\u2019t want him to tell her about it.\n\n\u201cI specifically asked him not to tell me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know \u2026 not right now, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nWhile Robert Blake has always maintained his innocence, he later lost a civil suit filed by Bakely\u2019s family. He appealed the verdict and the case was eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.\n\nLenore said that she never thinks about her mother\u2019s murder and who did it, but is still open to knowing the truth \u201cif it\u2019s ever an option.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cI feel like anyone would want to know the answer \u2026 I think I\u2019ve gone 19 years not knowing. If all of a sudden I knew whether or not he killed her, that would be shocking.\u201d", "description": "Rose Lenore, Daughter of Robert Blake opens up to", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/rose-lenore-abc-ml-191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
