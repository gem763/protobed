Republicans are beclowning themselves to pretend Trump is making sense \u2014 and that, sadly, is also no surprise.\n\nTrump has described his smoking-gun phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \u201cperfect,\u201d which is only true from the point of view of the prosecutors in his impeachment trial \u2014 if it comes to that. His lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has claimed that Zelensky was the first to mention Joe and Hunter Biden, while the rough transcript of the call clearly shows it was Trump who did so. Trump has demanded that the whistleblower be unmasked, and claimed that he or she somehow misrepresented the call, hoping no one will notice that the allegations in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint have been confirmed by documents and statements released by the White House.\n\n[Submit your question for Eugene Robinson\u2019s live chat on all things politics here]\n\nTrump has accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) of \u201ctreason\u201d and demanded that they be impeached. After first refusing to say whether he wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, he admitted it and called on China to investigate them, too. And as for Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) \u2014 who said that Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky was \u201ctroubling in the extreme \u201d and that his requests to Ukraine and China were \u201cwrong and appalling\u201d \u2014 Trump has called him a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019 \u201d and wants him impeached, too.\n\nRomney and Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio),however, are the only prominent GOP officeholders thus far to call out Trump for the conduct that will likely get him impeached. Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) have been critical of the China appeal but have said nothing about Ukraine. The bootlicking cowardice of today\u2019s Republican Party knows no bounds.\n\nPerhaps none has embarrassed himself more than Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who had a rough time Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Host Chuck Todd asked him about a quote of his that had appeared in the Wall Street Journal. When Johnson heard that $391 million in military aid for Ukraine might be being withheld to coerce an investigation into the Bidens, Johnson told the Journal, \u201cI winced. My reaction was, \u2018Oh God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere it is, the quid pro quo. But Johnson was apparently determined not to be seen as having criticized Trump lest he become the target of a Trump tweetstorm. So he launched into a diatribe about how Trump\u2019s presidency had been \u201csabotaged\u201d and given \u201cno measure of honeymoon whatsoever,\u201d and then dove into fantasy-based conspiracy theories about the origin of the Mueller investigation.\n\nAfter a long struggle by Todd to return to the subject of Ukraine, Johnson finally said: \u201cWhen I asked the president about that, he completely denied it. He adamantly denied it. He vehemently, angrily denied it. He said, \u2018I\u2019d never do that.\u2019 So that is the piece of the puzzle I\u2019m here to report today.\u201d\n\nRunner-up for some sort of Profiles in Spinelessness award is Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who said that when Trump stood on the White House lawn and called on the despotic Chinese government, with its kangaroo-court justice system, to investigate a former U.S vice president and his family, he was just kidding around to get a rise out of the media.\n\nLook at the videotape. What I see is a desperate president trying to convince the public that his attempted shakedown of Ukraine was so innocent, so unimpeachable, that he\u2019s willing to do the same thing to China openly. Then again, it might have been slam-dunk evidence for another article of impeachment. Either way, Trump\u2019s performance looked and sounded nothing like fun and games with the White House press corps.\n\nAt this point, we can dispense with the notion that Trump welcomes impeachment because he believes it gives him a political advantage. He reportedly told House Republicans that being impeached would be \u201ca bad thing to have on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d His tweets and harangues betray what seems to be a visceral horror of being hauled into the dock and put on trial, even if he believes that, ultimately, he will not be removed from office. In his long life of privilege, Trump has rarely been held accountable for his bad behavior. He seems not to enjoy the experience.\n\nFor now, Trump can cling to the fact that lily-livered Republicans still fear his wrath. They\u2019re looking at the polls, though, and hearing from their constituents. It is certainly true that brute-force intimidation can compel obedience \u2014 but it rarely generates true loyalty.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "Republicans give the president obedience, yes, but that\u2019s not true loyalty.", "authors": ["Eugene Robinson", "Columnist Focusing On Politics", "October At Pm", "Eugene Robinson Writes A Twice-A-Week Column On Politics", "Culture", "Hosts A Weekly Online Chat With Readers.
