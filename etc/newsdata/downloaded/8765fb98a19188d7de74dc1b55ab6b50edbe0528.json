Citing anonymous sources at NBC and AMI, Farrow, 31, claims that Weinstein was using the Enquirer\u2018s accumulated dirt on the Today show star\u2019s alleged workplace misconduct to pressure NBC executives to kill Farrow\u2019s long-gestating Weinstein expos\u00e9.\n\nNBC denies being threatened with Lauer. Nevertheless, Lauer\u2019s alleged behavior (including a just-revealed anal rape allegation) would eventually destroy the popular Today Show anchor. In fact, it was Farrow\u2019s reporting on Weinstein that would launch the #MeToo movement that steamrolled Lauer, among dozens of others in Hollywood and the elite media.\n\nNBC News Allegedly Covered Up a Number of Secret Payouts\n\nFarrow further alleges that NBC News felt especially vulnerable about Lauer due to a number of secret payouts involving the Today anchor\u2019s alleged misconduct; payouts that, if true, proved the network knew about Lauer long before he was fired in November of 2017:\n\nMore explosively, Farrow uncovers seven allegations of workplace sexual misconduct by Lauer that seem to contradict the network\u2019s stance that management had no knowledge of his behavior as well as seven nondisclosure agreements \u2014 many with hush-money payouts \u2014 to accusers of Lauer and others at NBC. Multiple Lauer accusers, including the woman whose complaint to NBC\u2019s human resources department resulted in Lauer\u2019s ouster, tell their stories in detail.\n\nNBC News denies it knew anything about the allegations against Lauer prior to the day he was fired.\n\nThat is difficult for many to believe, though. After all, we have had story after story about Lauer\u2019s behavior being an open secret at NBC News and the media in general.\n\nNBC Universal Was Eager to do Business with Weinstein\n\nCatch and Kill shows just how deep Weinstein\u2019s connections ran within NBC and reveals his aggressive effort to court additional executives. As Farrow gathered sources, Weinstein pitched Ron Meyer, the NBCUniversal vice chairman, on a home video and VOD deal for Weinstein Co. content. Weinstein Co. COO David Glasser\u2019s team \u201cbegan discussing the finer points with two home entertainment executives at NBCUniversal,\u201d Farrow writes. In September 2017, Meyer wrote to Weinstein, \u201cI look forward to us being in business together.\u201d While the interactions could be viewed as routine business (and the deal never materialized), Farrow casts them in a more jaundiced light. For Weinstein, he says, \u201cit was carrots and sticks.\u201d\n\nNBC News Executives Took Weinstein\u2019s Calls: \u2018Harvey, say no more. We\u2019ll look into it.\u2019\n\nYou do not do this when your own reporter is working on an expos\u00e9:\n\nIn one early call to [NBC News and MSNBC Chairman Andrew] Lack in spring 2017, Weinstein complained that the accusations against him were ancient history. \u201cIt was the \u201990s. You know? Did I go out with an assistant or two that I shouldn\u2019t have, did I sleep with one or two of them, sure. We all did that.\u201d Lack does not engage on this point but says, \u201cHarvey, say no more. We\u2019ll look into it.\u201d\n\nThings are about to get real interesting\u2026\n\nAndrew Lack Has His Own History of Office Affairs\n\nCatch and Kill delves into Lack\u2019s own history of office affairs when he was executive producer of CBS newsmagazine West 57th \u2014 one with anchor Jane Wallace (previously reported) and a second with associate producer Jennifer Laird, who would go on to a career in politics as mayor of Nyack, New York. Laird tells Farrow that things became \u201cextremely uncomfortable\u201d after the relationship ended. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a reason you don\u2019t get involved with your boss.\u201d Lack denies taking any retaliatory action.\n\nThis next one is going to blow your mind\u2026\n\nThe NBC Producer In Charge of Farrow\u2019s Story Was Severely Compromised\n\nNBC allegedly paid out a near-million dollar harassment claim for the executive producer put in charge of vetting Farrow\u2019s story!\n\nIn early August 2017, NBC News president Oppenheim asked for a review of Farrow and McHugh\u2019s Weinstein reporting by a team of producers from Dateline, including executive producer David Corvo. Farrow says he had a perfectly cordial meeting with Corvo. He later learned that the next day, NBC paid nearly $1 million to a woman who had made a harassment complaint against Corvo years before (according to Farrow, in the halls of NBC, such payoffs have become known as \u201cenhanced severance\u201d).\n\n\u201cDavid Corvo is appointed to vet the Weinstein story,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cAnd the next day they pay out almost a million dollars to cover up a claim of harassment against him. That is not an appropriate corporate practice when you are a news outlet.\u201d\n\nNBC doesn\u2019t deny the payout, only that it had anything to do with sexual harassment.\n\nNBC Allegedly Fired Farrow and Assured Weinstein the Story was Dead\n\nThough his contract with NBC News would not expire until October 2017, Farrow says by September, Weinstein was given assurances by executives that he was no longer working on the story for NBC. Farrow cites a phone call in which Griffin told Weinstein the story was not running as well as a call between Weinstein attorney David Boies and Lack during which Lack told Boies: \u201cWe\u2019ve told Harvey we\u2019re not doing a story. If we decide to do a story, we\u2019ll tell him.\u201d Weinstein was ecstatic[.]\n\nNBC Allegedly Blacklisted Farrow\n\nFarrow believes that he is blacklisted from NBC News and MSNBC. Only Maddow has had the clout to flout this ban\u2026 NBC\u2019s executives deny Farrow is banned, but multiple sources tell THR that their attempts to book Farrow have been quashed.\n\nNBC has always claimed it passed on Farrow\u2019s Harvey Weinstein story because the story was never nailed down, but this does not make sense after you learn Farrow obtained audio tape of Weinstein admitting he groped a model. The audio was taken secretly as part of a police sting operation, and on its own, without anything else, it is not only a legitimate story, it would have been a huge story no legitimate news organization would ever pass on.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
