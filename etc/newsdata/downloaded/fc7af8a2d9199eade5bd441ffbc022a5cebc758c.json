Yet EU citizens sleeping rough on Britain\u2019s streets are at risk of becoming the forgotten victims of a no-deal Brexit. And what is extremely worrying is that even the government\u2019s revised, light-touch Brexit document makes it clear that no deal will bring widespread and potentially dangerous consequences for those who are most vulnerable.\n\nA 2017 report for Crisis and Homeless Link has set out some of the serious risks facing homeless EU citizens that Brexit will create. Top of that list is the hostile environment and the concern that EU rough sleepers will be deterred from seeking help for fear \u2013 hardly unfounded \u2013 of deportation. These challenges will add to many existing barriers when it comes to accessing healthcare, benefits and support.\n\nRising homelessness is one of the worst consequences of austerity, which has been ongoing for almost a decade. And the British public shouldn\u2019t expect any step change from the new prime minister. As Mayor of London, Boris Johnson pledged to end rough sleeping in the capital by the 2012 Olympics. The reality was that rough sleeping doubled during Johnson\u2019s second term.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

This expenditure was not the departure from austerity the government would have us believe. We would need \u00a3574 million to address rough sleeping in the capital alone, as set out in London Mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s rough sleeping action plan.\n\nThe absence of political will is not the only barrier to eradicating, or even reducing, homelessness. There is seemingly some underlying contempt for homeless people too \u2013 this is where the danger grows for rough sleepers from the EU.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In 2017 the High Court ruled this approach to be illegal, but that does not seem to be enough to tear this government away from its \u201chostile environment\u201d policy, under the shadow of which these deportations took place.\n\nThankfully, in London, where EU citizens accounted for over a third of the almost 9,000 people sleeping rough last year, the Home Office\u2019s advances are being rejected. Sadiq Khan recently confirmed that services supported by the Greater London Authority would not participate in passing on information about individual rough sleepers without their permission. Haringey and Islington councils have also made clear their refusal to cooperate with the Home Office.\n\nBut as Boris Johnson continues to push aside democracy in his belief that no deal could somehow be in any way beneficial to this country, the protections for vulnerable EU citizens will lessen.\n\nRising homelessness is an issue that is met with equal measures of frustration and compassion by the British public. Frustration because there seems to be no end in sight to this upward trend, and compassion because there is a real desire to help. We\u2019ve seen the latter in the capital, with Londoners rallying behind Mayor Khan\u2019s efforts to tackle rough sleeping. They\u2019ve volunteered in their thousands for outreach centres, and last winter donated \u00a3250,000 to homeless charities.\n\nVolunteers\u2019 generosity cannot be understated and it needs to be matched and exceeded by a central government willing to deliver the sea change required to eradicate homelessness once and for all. In the meantime there is one very swift action the government could take to remove the immediate threat to EU rough sleepers, and that is to take no deal off the table.\n\nTom Copley is a Labour Londonwide Assembly member, and Labour\u2019s London Assembly Housing spokesperson", "description": "Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 the government\u2019s contingency plan for leaving the EU \u2013 doesn\u2019t mention the homeless.
