I took my eye off the ball for a moment, and disaster!\n\nAnita: What happened?\n\nHoi-man: Well, my younger brother, Kwok-ming turned eight last week and he\u2019s been pestering me to teach him how to ride a bike. For the last week, we\u2019ve been going out most evenings as soon as I get home from school.\n\nAnita: That sounds fun! I wish I could ride a bike too!\n\nHoi-man: Well, it\u2019s never too late to learn. I was twelve when Dad taught me how to ride one. Actually, I don\u2019t have my own bike right now and we\u2019ve been renting from the nearby bicycle shop. I\u2019m thinking about getting one though.\n\nAnita: Great idea!\n\nHoi-man: Yeah, and it\u2019s the most eco-friendly mode of transport too. I\u2019ve been looking around a bit and there\u2019s a shop near Dad\u2019s workplace that sells second-hand bikes and sports equipment. The brand-new bikes are quite expensive and Dad thought it\u2019s better to get the used ones instead. Anyway, back to the story.\n\nAnita: Yeah, go on.\n\nHoi-man: There\u2019s an open area behind our flat and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been practising. We\u2019ve been out three times and he\u2019s made really good progress. Until three nights ago, that is.\n\nAnita: What do you mean?\n\nHoi-man: Well \u2026 the hardest thing when you start to learn to ride a bike is keeping your balance. Kwok-ming has fallen a couple of times \u2013 another reason for not getting an expensive new one \u2013 but refused to get on a learner bike. He was being his impatient self, keeps insisting he can keep his balance without the two little wheels on the back, and I\u2019ve been holding the bike as he learns to pedal and keep his balance.\n\nAnita: Uh oh! I see where this is going!\n\nHoi-man: And last night, I was holding onto the saddle when my phone rang. I let go of the saddle for just a couple of seconds and the next thing I knew, he rode off on his own and crashed into a lamp post! By the time I got to Kwok-ming, he was on the floor howling in pain with the bike on top of him.\n\nAnita: Oh! Poor him! I hope he wasn\u2019t badly hurt.\n\nHoi-man: There was a deep cut on his arm and his forehead was badly bruised. Dad took him to the hospital and the doctor said he\u2019s also broken his left wrist.\n\nAnita: Ouch! That sounds really bad.\n\nHoi-man: Yeah, he needs to stay in the hospital for a week but he\u2019s enjoying the attention with Mum fussing over him like a mother hen, and friends and relatives bringing lots of toys and snacks. Things are not so great for me though. I got a bad scolding from my parents for not keeping an eye on him even though it wasn\u2019t my fault! Guess I\u2019ll have to watch him like a hawk in the future. We definitely don\u2019t want any more accidents, thank you very much.\n\nEND", "description": "Biking 101", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/listening20190911.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
