That\u2019s never good, but it was particularly bad then, in 1954, the year he crashed his car on the early-morning Milwaukee streets. Seat belts weren\u2019t common until the 1960s, and federal law didn\u2019t mandate them until 1968. Dad\u2019s unharnessed body was thrown out the windshield, through the quiet night, and onto the pavement. He survived\u2014otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be writing this\u2014but not without permanent disability. The road to mandatory seat belts was a long one, involving decades of medical and military research, legislative intervention, and corporate acquiescence. But today, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 90 percent of Americans use seat belts, which, the agency claims, save some 15,000 lives a year. They are almost automatic for most drivers and passengers. Except in one case. Even people who wear seat belts religiously tend not to do so in taxis. New York City cab passengers over age 16 are exempt from seat-belt laws (for now), and a 2014 NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission survey of such riders reported that only 38 percent of them wear seat belts. Why? In a 2008 study of 100,000 car trips, two psychologists concluded that riders might assume a lower risk of calamity in cars for hire: The trips are shorter, the drivers are seen as professionals with lots of road experience, and the passengers (wrongly) perceive a lower risk of harm in the back seat.\n\nFor years, this particular threat to public safety didn\u2019t affect people who didn\u2019t take taxis. But now, thanks to Uber and Lyft, trips by hired car have increased dramatically all over the country. Americans took 2.6 billion ride-share trips in 2017, and they were almost as likely to forgo a seat belt on those trips as New York City taxi patrons. One survey found that 43 percent of car-hire customers reported not always wearing a seat belt, and 80 percent don\u2019t buckle up for short trips. Sixty-five years later, my oldest kids are now about the age my father was when he was hurled from a vehicle, absent a seat belt, to permanent effect. Because of Uber and Lyft, they are far more likely than I was to risk a similar fate. Once you start looking, examples like this appear everywhere. Technology services are systematically, if invisibly, eroding long-won victories in public safety. Take vaping. Much like Uber transformed the cab ride with smartphones, e-cigarettes have reinvented cigarette culture with a discreet new technology: a battery-powered stick that heats and aerosolizes nicotine (or sometimes cannabis). They were invented in the early 2000s by Hon Lik, a 52-year-old Chinese pharmacist (and smoker), who wanted to find a way to scratch the same itch that a cigarette could, but without all the harmful chemicals\u2014smoking without the smoke. Makers marketed the products as therapeutic devices, beneficial to smokers hoping to quit. But health officials expressed concern about that claim from the start. In 2008, the World Health Organization declared that it \u201cdoes not consider [vaping] to be a legitimate therapy for smokers trying to quit.\u201d Ruyan Holdings, the Chinese company that brought Lik\u2019s invention to market, responded by funding a report arguing that e-cigs are substantially safer than traditional cigarettes, partly because \u201ceach puff contains one third to one half the nicotine in a tobacco cigarette\u2019s puff.\u201d The tech industry has undoubtedly improved people\u2019s individual, private lives. But it has not necessarily benefited their communal ones. But as my colleague Amanda Mull wrote, \u201cTo market a product as less harmful than cigarettes is to damn it with faint praise.\u201d Juul Labs, the San Francisco-based company that makes the most popular brand of e-cigarette in the U.S., sells pods at 3 and 5 percent nicotine, which is stronger than earlier vaping products. A single Juul pod delivers about 200 puffs, making each pod roughly equivalent to a pack of cigarettes in nicotine content. As Juuling became synonymous with vaping, the company\u2019s stronger, more capacious nicotine products became the norm.\n\nThe technology sector\u2019s global conquest rests partly on its total unconcern for the real-world impact of its products and services. Tesla beta-tests its \u201cautopilot\u201d semiautonomous mode on public roads because it can get away with doing so. Google Maps and Waze optimize for the fastest trip no matter what effect those routes might have on traffic or safety. Amazon has evaded responsibility for damages, injuries, and deaths caused by its delivery network by presenting it as arm\u2019s-length contractors, even as the retail giant imposes pressure to increase the speed and volume of distribution. Technology firms cover their exposure to risk the same way they create it: through willful ignorance. Public safety protects the public\u2014a collectivity worth shielding. It is a shared effort that begets a shared benefit. Some technological innovations, such as automobiles with lane-departure warnings or automatic emergency braking, help owners of the equipment along with those who surround them. But tech in the sense of Silicon Valley Big Tech has subtly rewritten our conception of the public. The industry has undoubtedly improved people\u2019s individual, private lives\u2014that\u2019s the business model. But it has not necessarily benefited their communal ones. The vision of the future that firms such as Uber, Amazon, and Facebook have grown rich selling is a decidedly individualist one: Get a ride just for you, wherever you are, via Uber. Receive almost any product tomorrow, without leaving home, from Amazon. Hear from only the people and groups you choose on Facebook. Technology products can improve health and safety, but largely at the personal level: carrying a cellphone for emergencies, or wearing a fitness tracker to motivate regular exercise. Solving one\u2019s own problems can de-escalate interest in solving communal ones. This libertarian individualism also grips the big-tech companies themselves, which pursue their private aspirations no matter the public cost.\n\nYou and me, your kids, your neighbors, your co-workers\u2014all the members of the general public\u2014are caught in the middle. On the one hand, we like and desire the tech industry\u2019s offerings, personally. But on the other hand, we can\u2019t always see the consequences of those offerings at a social scale. When those effects do become visible, we look for answers that eradicate all the bad stuff about tech without changing the good stuff. It\u2019s never so simple. For example, ride-share drivers have been accused of attacking, kidnapping, and sexually assaulting passengers; some victims have alleged that the companies knew about these assaults, yet failed to stop them. But people are also violently attacked in traditional taxis and car hires; limited data on all sides have made it difficult to determine whether ride-shares really are more dangerous than taxi and livery drivers. More certain is that exposure to such risk has risen substantially as a result of ride-sharing. More drivers convey more passengers more often. Over the past decade, people have completed billions of new rides in new contexts\u2014trips that never would have happened at all before Uber and Lyft came on the scene. Whether they mean to or not, companies such as these are changing the standards of public safety. Those effects come, in part, from globalizing and automating previously local, human processes. But they also arise when innovation imports the undesirable features of earlier, neighboring technologies and then intensifies them at scale.\n\nHere\u2019s another one: New York City medallion taxis are exempt from state laws that otherwise require children under the age of 4 to use child-safety seats. Passengers can bring their own child seat, and taxi drivers must allow riders to install and use one if they do so. But instead, most folks rationalize the risk in much the same way they do with seat belts: It\u2019s a short trip, and What are you gonna do, really? Ride-sharing apps have inherited this quandary and exported it to cities everywhere. Uber and Lyft do let riders request a car with a child-safety seat\u2014but only in a few cities, and for an extra fee (and probably a longer wait). Elsewhere, both companies encourage riders to bring their own as required by local law, but neither one appears to have a policy that requires drivers to accept such fares. And even if they did, bringing a car seat to a concert or ball game undoes the convenience of ride-sharing in the first place. Car seats are the life-saving result of decades of incremental progress on child safety. Some automakers offered them in the 1960s, and the NHTSA first adopted standards in 1971. Over time, the requirements became stricter and more complex (rear-facing for infants, boosters for preschoolers, tethered anchors, the LATCH installation standard). It\u2019s not uncommon for states to require specialized equipment for children up to age 8. Motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children in the United States. Passengers used to take the risk in taxicabs only under duress. But ride-sharing has given that exception a shortcut to convention, by exporting the false sense of comfort from taxi trips to rides of all kinds.\n\nUber and Lyft allowed drivers to operate, with little oversight, as they gunned for global growth at all costs. Like other \u201csharing economy\u201d companies, they exploited lax regulation and ambiguities and gaps in local laws to gain advantage. When California recently passed a bill demanding that companies give gig workers more benefits, Uber responded that it does not intend to reclassify its drivers as employees, because \u201cdrivers\u2019 work is outside the usual course of Uber\u2019s business.\u201d The company has always claimed to be \u201cjust\u201d a technology business, providing a set of software tools that form a marketplace on which drivers and passengers can connect. Even safety becomes a worry that a suite of technological solutions can remedy. This detached approach breeds indifference; the consequences become someone else\u2019s problem. Even with your seat belt safely fastened in your own car, with your kid properly harnessed in the back seat, technology has made driving more dangerous, because everyone is distracted by smartphones all the time. Drivers have gotten sidetracked at the wheel for as long as cars have been on the road. In the early 20th century, the roads themselves were sometimes the cause, lulling drivers to diversion in a condition that came to be known as \u201chighway hypnotism.\u201d Later, as cars added more devices, such as radios, CD players, and navigation systems, the car itself started to sidetrack drivers.\n\nBut equipment is just part of the picture. The NHTSA tracks three kinds of distraction: visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual diversions take your eyes off the road. That could mean kids arguing in the back seat, or scintillating neon signs along the route. Manual distractions take your hands off the wheel. Radios and controls do that, as do takeout cups and Eggs McMuffin. Cognitive distractions take your mind off driving. Those are innumerable, covering everything from struggles at home to anger at traffic to worries about the workday coming or gone. Smartphone use is particularly insidious for drivers because it fuses all three kinds of distraction: You look away from the road, take your hands off the wheel, and shift your thoughts to the world behind the screen. Moreover, smartphones distract drivers frequently, perhaps even constantly, as vehicle operators might pick up the phone at every stoplight. The NHTSA calls it \u201camong the worst of all driver distractions.\u201d The effects can be substantial. From 2012 to 2015, an average of 283,000 injuries a year could be traced to texting and smartphones. More recently, a combination of hands-free laws and distracted-driving awareness has reduced driver use of cellphones, but the handheld manipulation of these devices has fallen less rapidly. By 2017, car crashes had risen by 11 percent, compared with just a few years earlier, and distraction-caused collisions involving cellphones remained relatively steady. When it comes to public safety, citizens should demand widespread improvements in as many aspects of public life as possible. Smartphones didn\u2019t cause these problems on their own; widespread reliance on them did. Adults, especially younger ones, feel pressure to respond to work messages while driving. Social-media services can inspire people to catch up on their feed, post photos, or bang out quips on the road.\n\nAnd a 2018 law requiring new cars to include backup cameras to prevent injury when moving in reverse might have made things worse. Installing cameras meant adding a big screen to the dashboard, a change that happened to arrive alongside the proliferation of smartphone touch-screen interfaces. Many automakers redesigned the whole dashboard to match them. Now it\u2019s common for a single touch-screen display to operate the radio, the climate control, the navigation, and, of course, the backup camera. They are known as \u201cin-vehicle information systems,\u201d or IVIS, in auto-industry lingo. As you might expect, IVIS screens only distract drivers more. Now they can\u2019t operate the radio preset or the blower control by feel, without looking. The options are more complex, too: satellite radio, playback controls, map panning. It\u2019s almost like using a smartphone. Then Apple CarPlay and Android Auto arrived. Their familiar appearance does seem to reduce distraction compared with native IVIS equipment, but according to an American Automobile Association study, the software still produces substantial cognitive and visual diversion. Responding to texts (even by dictation), scrolling Spotify playlists, and managing the quirks of these systems still generate increased demands on driver attention compared with driving without them. In the same urban spaces where more cars are creating more traffic, with more passengers skipping seat belts and diverting their attention to IVIS and CarPlay screens while they inhale aerosolized tobacco, people are also using new kinds of transportation devices to get around. Electric scooter shares, like Bird and Lime, are among the \u201cmicromobility\u201d services that proponents hope will help reduce city dwellers\u2019 reliance on cars, especially for short trips.\n\nBird, Lime, and other services followed Uber\u2019s model, expanding rapidly to new cities to grow their market and stimulate consumer demand\u2014often without permits. In the cities where they took off, scooters have become staples of urban transport; they allow professionals to get to work without rumpling clothes or breaking a sweat. \u201cI cannot imagine life without them,\u201d my colleague Robinson Meyer wrote of the scooters last year. But according to a study published earlier this year, over 12 months two California emergency rooms admitted 249 patients with injuries from scooter mishaps. Most common were head injuries\u2014largely caused by riders\u2019 failure to wear helmets\u2014although fractures were also common. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study conducted in Austin, Texas, counted 20 injuries presented to medical-emergency services per 100,000 e-scooter trips over a three-month period. Almost half were head injuries, and 15 percent were traumatic brain injuries. Of 190 injured riders, only one had worn a helmet. Motorbike helmets were commercialized in the 1950s, and the U.S. Department of Transportation issued standards for manufacturers in 1964. In 1975, models for cycling appeared in earnest, and adoption increased in the decade that followed. Starting in 1987, some states began enacting laws requiring helmets, especially for children. Over time, a culture of helmet use became entrenched among casual and commuter cyclists alike. In 2012, 29 percent of bike-riding adults and 42 percent of children reported always wearing helmets; half said they wore helmets at least some of the time. Ninety percent of kids wore helmets when adults in their orbit also did; they were also more likely to do so in states with laws mandating helmet use.\n\nThe problem is, helmets ruin the appeal of shared e-scooters almost completely. As Michael Keating, the CEO of the micromobility company Scoot, told me last year, scooters such as Birds are most useful for making trips that would require a long walk easier without a car. Donning a helmet means carrying one, which could erase the benefits in convenience. That\u2019s the same problem bicycles have faced. Detractors of bicycle-helmet laws often complain that they discourage ridership or apologize for the ongoing reign of the car. They have a point. It\u2019s easy to wag a finger at riders who forgo helmets, and serious e-scooter injuries are relatively infrequent\u2014about 0.2 percent of trips, according to the Austin data. But there, the CDC found that only 10 percent of e-scooter riders sustained their injuries from vehicles, making auto-centrism an incomplete counterpoint to concerns about scooter safety. Helmet critics want to juggle a series of risks and rewards at urban scale. And the meaning of public safety should evolve, as the writer Sam Bloch has put it. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening when uninformed and inexperienced e-scooter riders injure themselves straightaway. If the vehicles\u2019 popularity continues to rise, that trend will only continue: The CDC studies suggest that peer influence\u2014riding with other people and seeing people ride safely\u2014has the greatest impact on cyclists\u2019 choices. In the end, it might be worthwhile to make certain safety compromises to spur new urban design and mobility, not to mention carbon use. But that\u2019s not how the scooter rollout has happened. Instead, it has shifted public safety absent the public\u2019s understanding that it is happening at all.\n\nThere\u2019s an irony in the technological erosion of general welfare, because innovations so often promise to benefit our lives\u2014sometimes by improving public safety explicitly. It\u2019s one of the promises of autonomous vehicles, for example: that they might reduce traffic injuries and fatalities like those caused by distracted drivers or motorists who fail to yield to scooters. That promise is speculative and possibly wrong, but its commercial value has inspired some governments to make substantial compromises in public safety in the present in order to chase improvements in the future. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, for example, issued executive orders allowing experimental use of driverless cars on Arizona roads, hoping to spur investment and job creation in the desert state. When an Uber operating in autonomous mode struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, critics blamed lax regulation, in part, for allowing Uber to take unnecessary risks with its equipment. But as the scooter advocates had done, some robocar proponents scoffed, seeing selective concern about the fatal consequences of traffic in America. With more than 40,000 automobile-related fatalities in the United States each year, why single out one autonomous-vehicle death for special attention? The total number of deaths from shirking seat belts or car seats in ride-shares, or even from the unknown pathogens afflicting vaping devices, is small compared with those from other trends. Griping about Uber or Juul can seem like missing the forest for the trees\u2014or come across as knee-jerk traditionalism that unfairly demonizes youthful trends. Imagine being worried about a dozen vaping deaths or e-scooter injuries, some complain, instead of almost 40,000 deaths each year from guns in America, or 480,000 from smoking. Most of these consequences were foreseeable, but nobody was looking for them. Responding to that criticism about autonomous-car deaths specifically last year, I argued that focusing on the quantity of deaths or injuries, via thought experiments such as the trolley problem, misses the point. A utilitarian obsession with outcomes overlooks the flaws in the social, political, and economic processes that aspire to realize those outcomes. Even when the numbers affected are small, the way the problems arise can be significant. Likewise, victories can also be ambiguous. Ridesharing might have reduced drunk-driving in some cities, but not others, for example.", "description": "Without us even noticing", "authors": ["Ian Bogost"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Color_option_1_Zoomed_out_2_Current_View/facebook.png?1570551998", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
