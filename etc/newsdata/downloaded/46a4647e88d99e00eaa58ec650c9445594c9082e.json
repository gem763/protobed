There are two new colours, green and purple, in addition to the existing white, black, yellow and red; the coral and blue that came with the iPhone XR it replaces are gone.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro's colour changes are perhaps the most surprising. In addition to the green \u2013 which marks a significantly bold colour choice for the premium line, and a major departure from the traditional metals, white or black \u2013 the material has also changed, using a matte texture rather than the very glossy, shiny backs of the iPhone XS and XS Max.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Those took up the majority of the introduction of both iPhones \u2013 and even if they didn't, they would be hard to miss, given the introduction adds three bulbous new lenses to the back of the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nIn addition to the one or two cameras that were found in the iPhone XR and XS, Apple has added a wide-angle lens, which allows people to zoom out to get twice as much into a photo than the existing models.\n\nThey also add new features to the front-facing cameras, too. They can see far more with their own wide-angle lenses, as well as a new slow motion video option for selfies.\n\nApple stressed that as well as the hardware, those phones include new software features that will allow the pictures to be even better.\n\nThe multiple cameras also give the ability to record from two at once, Apple said. Demonstrating the iPhone 11 Pro, it showed how people could make videos that filmed from both the wide and zoom lenses, for instance \u2013 or even record from the front and back cameras at once.\n\nThey include Night Mode, for instance, which Apple says vastly improves their performance in the dark. Such a tool has long been available in Google's Pixel line, and Apple's tool appears to use similar software tricks to brighten up photos and find details that would usually be hidden in the shadows.\n\nAnother software tool that was shown off was a new \"Deep Fusion\" feature. That takes a whole host of images whenever people use their phone \u2013 with some of those pictures taken even before the user presses the button \u2013 before picking out the best bits of each and using them for improved photos.\n\nApple also said it had improved the editing software for both photos and videos in the new phones. Those new tools should allow people to create professional-looking phoos easily, it suggested.\n\nThe company did give some time to other features, such as the new A13 Bionic chip that powers everything else in the phone. But even some of those were shown in service of the camera, and the new kinds of imaging capabilities they enable.\n\nTo find out everything about the iPhone 11, click here; the iPhone 11 Pro is covered in full here.
