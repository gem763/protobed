Year-to-date, the SQ stock price is basically flat. Now may be a good time to ask why Square shares have been falling and what we can expect in the final quarter of 2019.\n\nI believe that the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. In the coming weeks, I\u2019d be a buyer below $55, especially if the price approaches or even goes below $50. Here are the must-know fundamental metric and price levels for SQ stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSquare Stock\u2019s Q3 Guidance Failed to Impress\n\nSquare was co-founded in February 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Its payments processing business, also referred to as \u201cpayments as a service,\u201d has been a game changer in serving small businesses. To the delight of early investors, this innovative financial services company has expanded quickly and become a disruptor.\n\nSQ stock reported Q2 earnings on Aug. 1 after market close. Notably, the payment-solutions company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Its total net revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.17 billion.\n\nAnd on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street\u2019s expectation of 17 cents per share. A year ago in Q3, Square stock\u2019s adjusted earnings per share came in at 13 cents.\n\nSquare\u2019s subscription and services-based revenue also increased 87% to $251 million. Gross payment volume of $26.8 billion increased from $21.4 billion year-over-year. This growth has been driven by its Cash App, Square Capital and Instant Deposit. Analysts were especially impressed with Cash App \u2014 quarterly revenue came at $135 million.\n\nThe quarterly report once again confirmed that Square stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.\n\nInvestors were especially concerned by the company\u2019s lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Its Q3 adjusted-EPS guidance of 18 cents to 20 cents trailed the average estimate of 22 cents. Square management now expects Q3 adjusted revenue to be between $590 million and $600 million as opposed to the consensus of $599 million.\n\nSquare stock\u2019s losses on the bottom line are also projected to be higher than expected. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide.\n\nWhere SQ Stock\u2019s Price Is Now\n\nThe U.S. stock market has had several big winners in the past year. However, Square stock has not been one of them. Over the past 12 months, SQ shares are down about 36%.\n\nLet us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the years to have a better view on what to expect in the coming weeks.\n\nFollowing SQ stock\u2019s IPO in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.\n\nSQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, shares have been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.\n\nAfter a highly volatile first half of 2019, August has not been a good month for Square shares either. That\u2019s of course due to the weak Q3 guidance which has underwhelmed investors.\n\nOn earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. Now the shares are hovering around $58.", "description": "Over the past decade, Square (NYSE:SQ) has become a dominant player in the mobile payments and financing sphere.
