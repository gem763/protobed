I have got lots of respects for Romelu but his time was up here.\n\n\u2018We are very happy with the recruitment we did. Towards the end the right one we just didn\u2019t get him over the line.\n\n\u2018You\u2019d rather bite the bullet and wait because you don\u2019t want to spend big amounts of money on something that you are not sure of.\u2019\n\nSitting tenth in the Premier League, Manchester United desperately need to return to winning ways on Sunday when they make the trip to St James\u2019 Park to face Newcastle.\n\nSolskjaer added: \u2018Of course you don\u2019t enjoy not winning games. You put your heart, life and soul into this job.\n\n\u2018If you win games you are happier, your mood changes but it doesn\u2019t mean your performances have been better \u2013 results change mood.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018For us to get a result [at Newcastle] is vital now. I think it will change the mood. The boys can go away on their international break and freshen up their heads.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolskjaer also praised Manchester United\u2019s fans for their support during the team\u2019s poor start to the 2019-20 campaign.\n\n\u2018The fans are great I have to say,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s easy to be positive when I see them, they have been very positive with me.\n\n\u2018They see what you are doing and they keep going. We want to pay them back for their loyalty and support by getting better results and better performances.\n\n\u2018I can assure them we are working hard to do so.\u2019", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has revealed Manchester United were close to signing a striker in the summer after Romelu Lukaku joined Inter Milan.
