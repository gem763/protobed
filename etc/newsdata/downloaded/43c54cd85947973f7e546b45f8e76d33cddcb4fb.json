You can hear the referees calling it six again, six again,\" Thurston said.\n\n\"And then changing the call on the run. It's not a good look. It is not a good look at all.\n\n\"I would be pretty shattered if I was the Raiders. The next set, Tedesco scores and wins them the match.\n\n\"Really, it is not a great look. As a team, you want to take the referees out of the equation and win the game being a consistent footy team, but, yeah,\n\nhuge, huge call.\"", "description": "Sydney Roosters have won back to back NRL grand finals but it came in the most controversial fashion.
