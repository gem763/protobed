Why give as much of two years of your life to a provider? Their speeds could get worse. A better deal could come around. Hell, 5G could become a viable NBN alternative.\n\nThankfully, we\u2019re now seeing more providers offer contract-free plans. Signing a long-term contract never feels great, and contract-free plans are just so much more flexible. You can leave whenever you want, for whatever reason. You could be moving overseas, or you could just be unhappy with your service.\n\nMany NBN providers have an optional modem you can buy, but some will force you to buy a model they range. To make it a bit easier, we\u2019re only looking at plans where a modem purchase is optional, and where you won't get hit with any upfront setup fees.\n\nHere are some of our favourite no-contract NBN plans with no setup fees:\n\nNBN 50 plans with no-contract and at least 500GB\n\nIn most cases, you can get a contract-free NBN 50 plan for less than $70 per month. While the more \"premium\" providers can and will charge a little extra, there are plenty of plans priced between $60 and $70 right now.\n\nSome of this can be chalked up to promotional pricing. For example, Tangerine will give you your first six months at a discounted rate. You\u2019ll pay $59.90 per month for your first half-a-year, and $69.90 thereafter.\n\nIn terms of non-discounted pricing, Mate has an unlimited data NBN plan for $69 per month.\n\nNBN 100 plans with no-contract and at least 500GB\n\nNBN 100 plans have gotten a bit more expensive recently, but there are still cheaper options around. Thanks to a promo, you can pay as little as $79.90 per month for an NBN 100 plan with Tangerine. This discount will apply for your first six months; you\u2019ll pay $89.90 thereafter.\n\nAt the higher end, you've got unlimited NBN 100 plans from the likes of Aussie Broadband at $99 per month. It\u2019s also worth noting that Aussie Broadband is one of the only ISPs that provides data about how much NBN capacity it buys, which can help give you a much better idea of the actual speeds you can expect.\n\nAlex Choros is Managing Editor at WhistleOut, Australia's phone and internet comparison website.\n\nFind more great bargains at Lifehacker Coupons.\n\nAs Lifehacker editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too.
