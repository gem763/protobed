Net-net, from its late July 2019 highs, PayPal stock has dropped more than 15%.\n\n3 Big Reasons Why You Should Consider Buy PayPal Stock At $100 More\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nTime to buy the near term dip in a long term winner? I think so. For three big reasons.\n\nFirst, PayPal is one of the more important players in the secular growth digital payments world, and as that world continues to grow over the next several years, PayPal\u2019s revenues and profits will similarly march higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSecond, Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, is in the early stages of monetizing its enormous user base, and Venmo revenue ramp over the next few years will provide a big tailwind for growth.\n\nThird, considering its multi-faceted big growth drivers, PayPal stock is cheap here and now.\n\nThe investment implication? Buy PYPL stock here, at $100, before the market realizes the stock is too cheap for its own good.\n\nPayPal Is a Secular Growth Company\n\nThe first big reason to buy PayPal stock is that PayPal is a secular growth company with tons of growth potential over the next few years.\n\nHere\u2019s the story. Cash payments are dead. Digital payments are the future. There\u2019s nothing stopping this trend. Cash is inconvenient to carry around, easy to lose, and clunky. Alternative payment methods \u2013 like PayPal \u2013 are convenient to carry around (PayPal is in your phone), hard to lose (just don\u2019t misplace your phone), and non-clunky (PayPal doesn\u2019t take up any physical space).\n\nFurther, a ton of shopping is done through the digital channel these days, and you can\u2019t pay with cash through the digital channel \u2013 you use a payment card or a digital payment account.\n\nAs such, digital payments constitute a very big, very important, and rapidly growing market. E-retail sales measured just over $2.9 trillion globally last year and project to grow at a 17% compounded annual growth rate into 2023. Of that $2.9 trillion pie, PayPal accounted for roughly 20% share in 2018, and given management\u2019s guide for 2019 total payment volume, that share will likely rise by about 70 basis points in 2019.\n\nThe important takeaway? PayPal is expanding its market share in a 17% growth market. Assuming this share expansion persists as it should, given Venmo\u2019s ramp (more on this later), PayPal reasonably projects as a 20%-plus revenue growth company over the next several years.\n\nMeanwhile, operating margins are running higher at a consistent cadence of 50 to 100 basis points each year thanks to increased scale; this should continue, too.\n\nBig picture, thanks to its favorable positioning in a secular growth market, PayPal projects as 20%-plus revenue growth company over the next few years with upside margin drivers.\n\nVenmo\u2019s Ramp Will Be Big\n\nThe second big reason to buy PayPal stock is that Venmo is in the first few innings of what projects to be a huge revenue ramp over the next several years.\n\nI thoroughly believe that Venmo is the future of commerce. Let me explain why with a recent example. A colleague picked up bagels on the way to work on Friday morning. Five years ago, I would\u2019ve whipped out my wallet, and paid him in cash. But, I don\u2019t even own a wallet anymore \u2013 I use one of those phone-wallet cases \u2013 and I don\u2019t carry cash.\n\nSo, what did I do? I paid him $10 through Venmo. He will get that Venmo payment, which he will either transfer to his bank (for which Venmo will take a 10% cut) or he will spend it with his Venmo card.\n\nThis is a microcosm for what is happening everywhere. P2P commerce used to be dominated by cash transactions. Now, no one carries cash anymore. So, P2P commerce is dominated by digital payments today. In the P2P digital payments world, Venmo is king, because they\u2019ve invented a way to make P2P digital payments social, fun, and interactive. They also have scale, which helps, because it allows for uniformity and consistency.\n\nStory continues", "description": "After sprinting higher through the first seven months of 2019, shares of digital payments provider PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have struggled over the past few months as slowing global economic conditions have converged on escalating trade tensions to create cause for concern with respect to PayPal's growth", "authors": ["Luke Lango"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WuUXK1Z4AaaUzj5LZHxCSQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/ef3d4f5dbb18503e1a35cb18c62e2be1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
