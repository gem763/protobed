A golden croquette, hot from the pan, to wolf in one go. Or perhaps a dainty bun of choux pastry filled with cream, its surface tacky with chocolate fondant\u2026\n\nI splashed out on some dressed crab this week, padded out the snow-white needles of flesh with a few breadcrumbs, rolled them into balls and deep fried the lot. Toothsome, an old fashioned and totally appropriate word for a crisp morsel of crab with the faintest hint of brick-red harissa, but you couldn\u2019t really think of them as a meal. We passed a batch of them round in a basket while drinking beers and eating thin slices of deep maroon, fat-marbled ham. No forks were necessary, although a napkin or two wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss. Should you feel they would make supper, roll each one into the size of a plump scallop and serve with a tangle of green beans, lightly steamed then tossed in a shallow pan of finely chopped bacon and its glorious fat.\n\nIn my house, puddings and pastries are on the menu. Crumbs of comfort in a world gone mad\n\nI should mention that I put mayonnaise in my crab croquettes and I do know it sounds a little odd, but I have been doing so for more than 20 years. The addition does more than bind the crab and crumbs \u2013 it is partly responsible for the soft, silk-like texture of the filling.\n\nPerhaps to take our minds away from other events, I made a tray of sweet choux pastries, too, filled not only with cream but with nuggets of chopped chocolate. In my house, puddings and pastries are back on the menu with a vengeance. Crumbs of comfort in a world gone mad.\n\nCrab and harissa croquettes\n\nIf I have time, I will often prepare a crab myself, cracking the shell and tugging out the flesh with a skewer. It\u2019s a deliciously messy job for a Saturday morning. That said, for fritters and these golden-shelled croquettes, it is worth considering the ready-picked fresh crab sold in tubs. I suggest the crisp panko crumbs, available in supermarkets and Japanese shops, for their ease and lightness. You can use fresh breadcrumbs, dried in the oven until crisp, if you prefer.\n\nServes 4\n\nwhite crab meat 450g\n\npanko crumbs 125g\n\nspring onions 3\n\nparsley leaves 7g (a handful)\n\ncoriander leaves 7g (a handful)\n\neggs 2\n\ngrain mustard 1 tbsp\n\nharissa 2 tsp\n\nmayonnaise 120g\n\nYou will also need oil for deep frying\n\nPut the crab and breadcrumbs into a large mixing bowl. Finely slice the spring onions, then chop the parsley and coriander leaves. Add all three to the crab and mix gently.\n\nIn a second bowl, break the eggs and beat lightly to mix yolks and whites, then blend in the mustard, harissa and mayonnaise. Stir into the crab gently combining crab, crumbs and seasoning.\n\nShape the crab mixture into 20 balls, each weighing approximately 45g, rolling them lightly in your hands, floured if necessary. Let the balls settle for 20 minutes in the fridge.\n\nPour enough oil into a pan in which to deep fry the croquettes and heat to 180C on a kitchen thermometer. Place one of the croquettes on a draining spoon and lower into the oil \u2013 it should crackle immediately \u2013 followed by 5 or more of the others, taking care not to crowd the pan. Keep an eye on the heat \u2013 you need it to remain fairly static. Fry the croquettes for 2-3 minutes until golden, lift out and drain on kitchen paper then repeat with further batches until the mixture is finished. Serve hot, with halves of lemon or lime.\n\nWhite chocolate and lemon buns\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cream of the crop: white chocolate and lemon buns. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The Observer\n\nA bun filled with cream and nibs of chocolate, finished with a gossamer-thin coating of lemon icing. A frivolous thing, a treat for a Sunday afternoon. Lemon has a welcome effect on white chocolate, diluting the latter\u2019s tendency to cloy by adding a clean, fresh note. Use dark chocolate if you prefer.\n\nMakes 8\n\nFor the buns:\n\nwater 125ml\n\nbutter 50g\n\nstrong white flour 75g\n\nsalt a good pinch\n\neggs 2, beaten\n\nFor the filling and icing:\n\nwhite chocolate 100g\n\ndouble cream 250g\n\nlemon curd 125g\n\nicing sugar 175g\n\nlemon juice 2 tbsp\n\nSet the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment.\n\nPour the water into a small saucepan, add the butter and let it melt, then add the flour and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon until you have a thick paste, then remove from the heat. Transfer the paste to the bowl of a food mixer and add the beaten eggs, a little at a time, beating at a fast pace with a flat paddle attachment. When you have a thick, creamy, sticky dough, place 8 generously heaped tbsp of the mixture on the prepared baking sheet.\n\nBake the buns for approximately 25 minutes, until well risen and crisp, then remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Finely chop the chocolate and set aside. Using a chilled bowl, whip the cream, until thick enough to spoon into the buns. Very gently fold in the chocolate and the lemon curd. Pierce a hole in each bun using a chop stick or small knife then push in the cream with a teaspoon. If you have a piping bag, use that. Set the buns back on the wire rack. Sift the icing sugar into a bowl, stir in the lemon juice then spoon over the buns and leave to set.\n\nThe Observer publishes recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Good Fish Guide", "description": "Delicious bite-sized morsels, savoury and sweet.
