His fervent argument is that humanity must spread to a second planet as insurance for long-term survival.\n\n\u201cWhich future do you want?\u201d he asked near the start of a presentation Saturday night at a launch site near the southern tip of Texas, during which he said the options were being \u201cconfined to Earth\u201d or becoming a spacefaring species.\n\nMusk said he hoped the audience agreed that humans should prepare for life elsewhere in the solar system as he delivered a progress report on Starship, a giant rocket that is the centerpiece of his ambitions.\n\nStanding before the prototype and a rocket built earlier in the company\u2019s history, he pledged that Starship would first take off to an altitude of 65,000 feet and then land, \u201cin about one to two months.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is going to sound totally nuts,\u201d he said later, \u201cbut I think we want to try to reach orbit in less than 6 months,\u201d adding that this timeline relied on continued improvements in manufacturing the rockets.\n\nWhat Is Starship?\n\nStarship is the latest name for the upper stage of what Musk had been calling BFR. The \u201cB\u201d stood for Big, the \u201cR\u201d stood for Rocket, and Musk never publicly stated the meaning of \u201cF.\u201d\n\nSpaceX currently flies two rockets: the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy, which is essentially a Falcon 9 with two additional Falcon 9 boosters attached to the side. The present-day Falcons are too small for sending people to Mars.\n\nMusk and SpaceX have long envisioned a much larger rocket. For a while, Musk referred to it as the \u201cMars Colonial Transporter.\u201d But when he finally revealed a design at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 2016, he called it the \u201cInterplanetary Transport System.\u201d\n\nThis spaceship was gargantuan, with a diameter of nearly 40 feet, and the capacity to take 100 people to Mars.\n\nA prototype of SpaceX\u2019s Starship spacecraft at a test site in Texas on Sept. 28, 2019. (Kenneth Chang/The New York Times) More\n\nA year later in Australia, Musk said the rocket had been scaled down by one-quarter, to a diameter of 30 feet. This was the BFR. The second stage was a sleek-looking spacecraft that would return to Earth in one piece and land vertically.\n\nLast November, SpaceX announced the Starship name; the first stage of BFR is now known as the Super Heavy booster. In recent days, Musk has been posting updates as the prototypes come together.\n\nOn Saturday before Musk\u2019s presentation, SpaceX highlighted Starship\u2019s size by displaying it alongside the company\u2019s original Falcon 1 rocket, which first launched to orbit in 2008.\n\nCan This Really Be Done?\n\nStarship with the Super Heavy booster is essentially a rocket as powerful as a Saturn 5, which took NASA\u2019s Apollo astronauts to the moon 50 years ago, but it\u2019s fully reusable. For Apollo, everything but the small capsule on top, where the astronauts sat, was discarded along the way, and even the capsule could be used only once.\n\nExperts say Starship is within the realm of the possible, without requiring impossible physics or unlikely technological leaps. Indeed, Starship employs ideas that were studied decades ago but never built. The biggest innovation is perhaps that SpaceX and Musk have applied the accelerated research-and-development approach of Silicon Valley, building fast and fixing failures fast.", "description": "BOCA CHICA VILLAGE, Texas -- As Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of SpaceX, says repeatedly, he created a rocket company because he wanted to colonize Mars.
