People get that this is a turning point of some kind, just as are the proposals that came \u2013 ostensibly from the Synod (\u201cwalking together\u201d) \u2013 in the Relatio Finalis to Francis. I don\u2019t think many people doubt that the document was written some time ago, so these were the desired objectives all along. A combination of German money and influence with thoroughly unprepared South American input, as well as a glaringly weak slate of participants at the \u201cwalking together\u201d guaranteed their predetermined outcome.\n\nWhat was truly weird was this Pachamama phenomenon. No one ever gave an adequate explanation of what it is or why it received so much attention. So we ask the questions. Were these figurines really important? They got a lot of attention and insiders ran around with their hair ablaze after they were boosted from the church. They bowed down to them in the gardens and lugged them around in processions. If they are important what the heck are they? And, if they are really not all that important (read: No, they are not demonic idols of a false religion.), then effectively they are grown ups playing with dolls on the edge of a Synod of Bishops. Weird, doesn\u2019t cover this.\n\nThe Golden Calf image has come to a lot of people\u2019s minds lately, and rightly so. Bp. Schneider isn\u2019t the only one to make the connection.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve been thinking about is the aftermath of the Golden Calf Incident.\n\nFirst, when Moses came down the mountain, straight from God\u2019s expressions of wrath, he heard a \u201cnoise of war\u201d which was the revelry of the people. There are indications in the texts, euphemisms. There was a wild orgy going on.\n\nMoses destroyed the idol, ground it and made the people drink the water.\n\nThe Aaron gave the lamest excuse ever given in Scripture: \u201cHey, they gave me gold and I put it in the fire and, well, this calf came out!\u201d\n\nMoses saw that the people had \u201cbroken loose\u201d.\n\nRemember that, before, they had come to the mountain to form a covenant with God and all the men still exercised the Adamic priesthood. Not any more. This is when the priesthood was stripped by God from all men and settled on the Levites, descendants of Levi.\n\nThe first thing the new priests did was to take swords and go through the camp and slay those who had \u201cbroken loose\u201d, who fell into idolatry. The ordination of the Levitical priesthood was a baptism in blood of idolaters.\n\nAnd then God sent a plague.\n\nThe point: Glorious and horrible things result from idol worship and the overthrowing of false religion.\n\nI will repeat what I have written before.\n\nGod chose us from before the creation of the cosmos to live in THESE days. It is an honor to be witnessing the crazy stuff going on. But it is incumbent on all of us now to buckle on the spiritual armor God offers and take places in the lines of the Militant Church of which we are members.\n\nReview your state in life. Make corrections if you have to.\n\nUse the sacraments well.\n\nIncrease your mortifications and acts of reparation.\n\nReview your Faith and be ready to explain what you believe.\n\nBe inviting and be joyful and be confident.\n\nIf something truly dreadful results in the Church from what we are seeing, know that Christ the King and Mary, Queen of Heaven, will triumph. Be on the winning side of that, even though it costs dearly.\n\nLet us close our ranks as never before in the face of the internal and external challenges to come.\n\nViva Christo Rey!", "description": "", "authors": ["View All Posts Fr.
