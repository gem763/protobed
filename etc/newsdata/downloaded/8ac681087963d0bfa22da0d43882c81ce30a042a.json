The state is using everything from concentration camps to facial-recognition technology to ensure that the only worship and belief allowed is that which submits to Chinese Communist orthodoxy. People who resist this mandate are ruthlessly plowed over.\n\nIn contrast with China, the United States was founded on the principle that rights are rooted in nature and nature\u2019s God\u2014not in government fiat. The U.S. should counter China with a resolute commitment to advance not only economic fairness, but also human rights and freedom of conscience.\n\nThe massive scope of China\u2019s crimes can make it seem as if there\u2019s little Americans can do. We are tempted to see the Chinese people merely as units of economic possibility rather than as human beings in peril, with real lives and souls. While no quick strategy could completely roll back Beijing\u2019s cruelty, there are many steps the U.S. could immediately take to confront China\u2014morally as well as economically.", "description": "", "authors": ["Russell Moore", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": ""}
