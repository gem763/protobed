A repo trade happens when a firm offers high-quality securities, like U.S. Treasurys UST, +0.11% , as collateral to finance trading and lending activities overnight. The borrowers the next day pay back those loans, with interest \u2014 essentially, they repo the bonds.\n\nBut when there\u2019s fear in the market or when there\u2019s not enough cash or sufficient reserves in the system, the repo rate can explode like it did this week, prompting intervention from the New York Federal Reserve.\n\nIf you\u2019re still confused, Guy LeBas, Janney Capital Management\u2019s fixed income strategist, is here to explain, with the help of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d:\n\nRepo (repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement) is a common way to finance a bond. Essentially, an owner buys a bond and then borrows, say 95% of the value of that bond, posting the bond as collateral. 2/x pic.twitter.com/UdWhTLOOwT \u2014 Guy LeBas (@lebas_janney) September 17, 2019\n\nWhy we care, in one chart: 4/x pic.twitter.com/nO0frzJwpC \u2014 Guy LeBas (@lebas_janney) September 17, 2019\n\nA host of short term things like corporate bond issuance, Treasury settlements, tax payments and such are coming together to squeeze the financing markets, but this is a symptom, not the underlying problem. 6/x pic.twitter.com/drcWNR2BAD \u2014 Guy LeBas (@lebas_janney) September 17, 2019\n\nNormally @NewYorkFed would fix these short term problems with \"TOMOs\" or \"Temporary Open Market Operations\" (essentially, they become repo lenders) but they appear non-reactive thus far for whatever reason. 8/x pic.twitter.com/BLJHK5fB0E \u2014 Guy LeBas (@lebas_janney) September 17, 2019\n\nI'm talking about hedge fund blow ups, surprise losses from large but marginal banking entities, etc. The truly unpredictable stuff.\n\n\n\nWhen repo breaks, risk market tend to suffer the consequences. 10/10.
