[STUDIO BLU]\n\nWhat do singer-songwriter Heize and pop diva Taylor Swift have in common? Well apart from their obvious talents in songwriting and great senses of style, they both use the breakups they go through as inspiration for their catchy hits.\u201cBreakups are hard, but I enjoy writing about them because I know many people will resonate,\u201d Heize explained during a group interview in western Seoul last Friday ahead of her album\u2019s release. \u201cI think people\u2019s lives are all similar, and I like knowing that my songs help comfort them.\u201dHeize returned with her fifth EP \u201cLate Autumn\u201d on Sunday, and like many of her previous releases, it\u2019s stocked with songs about love and relationship struggles that the 28-year-old wrote herself.Although broken hearts are a running theme, with her two lead tracks \u201cFalling Leaves are Beautiful\u201d and \u201cLate Autumn,\u201d Heize said she wanted to help people realize that breakups, like autumn, give way to brighter days.\u201cI like autumn best out of all seasons. Many people think of it as a very bitter time when the wind becomes chilly and the branches thin, but autumn eventually leads to spring. Like fall, breakups are kind of like a preparatory stage for a better future. This is what I learned from my own experience.\u201dMusically, Heize brought in several new changes to her latest EP.She\u2019s collaborated with singer-songwriter Crush and experimented with the city pop style for the first time, a genre that she\u2019s hoping to continue experimenting with for future projects.\u201cLate Autumn\u201d also includes a remake of early 2000\u2019s duo Candy Man\u2019s classic \u201cDiary,\u201d which the singer previously remade for her YouTube channel \u201cDa HEIZE\u201d earlier this year.\u201cI really resonate with the lyrics that \u2018time is like magic\u2019 and the message that although a breakup can be really painful, it might have been for the best.\u201d\u201c\u2018Diary\u2019 is also the track I had up on my Cyworld homepage the longest,\u201d she said, recalling the now-defunct social networking site that she spent a lot of time on as a student.Since debuting in 2014 and rising to fame with her TV appearance on the second season of \u201cUnpretty Rapstar,\u201d Heize has become one of Korea\u2019s most in-demand female vocalists, landing the No. 1 spot on music charts with multiple hits. Her music videos for \u201cStar\u201d and \u201cYou, Clouds, Rain\u201d each have over 20 and 30 million views on YouTube, and earlier this year, the artist even collaborated with BTS\u2019s Suga on a track he produced, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk together.\u201d\u201cI credit much of my success to the timing of my career, when singer-songwriters are receiving a lot of attention,\u201d said Heize.\u201cI also don\u2019t find the presence of other female soloists in the charts as competition because we\u2019re all unique and none of our colors overlap. That\u2019s why we are successful in our own way.\u201dBut she admitted that she recently started worrying about how her repetitive lifestyle might lead to writer\u2019s block. \u201cI\u2019m in a cycle where I perform during festival season and work on my albums the rest of the year. I\u2019m often inspired by nature for my songs, but I\u2019ve already written about stars and rain.\u201d\u201cI think I still have a lot to explore on the topic of love. I guess I\u2019ll get a lot of new ideas when I\u2019m in a new relationship.\u201dBY KIM EUN-JIN [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/13194430.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
