The Swiss have looked after American interests in Tehran for decades.\n\n\u201cIf any action takes place against Iran, the action will be faced by Iran\u2019s answer immediately,\u201d IRNA quoted the note as saying. It added that Iran\u2019s response wouldn\u2019t be limited to the source of the threat, without elaborating.\n\nIRNA separately reported Wednesday that Iran\u2019s first delegation for the annual U.N. event had not left Iran due to not having visas. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was to travel to New York on Friday, with Rouhani following behind Monday, according to the agency.\n\nAs the host of the U.N.\u2019s headquarters, the U.S. is mandated to offer world leaders and diplomats visas to attend meetings there. But as tensions have risen, the U.S. has put increasing restrictions on Iranians like Zarif.\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is traveling to Saudi Arabia for meetings after Saturday\u2019s attack on a Saudi oil field and the world\u2019s largest crude oil processing plant. Saudi officials separately planned to share information about the weapons used in the attack they allege are Iranian.\n\nSaudi Arabia also said on Wednesday that it joined a U.S.-led coalition to secure the Mideast\u2019s waterways amid threats from Iran after an attack targeting its crucial oil industry, while Rouhani told the kingdom it should see the attack as a warning to end its yearslong war in Yemen.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have claimed the attack. The U.S. accuses Iran of being behind the assault, while Saudi Arabia already has said \u201cIranian weaponry\u201d was used. Iran denies that.\n\n\u201cAlmost certainly it\u2019s Iranian-backed,\u201d Prince Khalid bin Bandar, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to the United Kingdom, told the BBC. \u201cWe are trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.\u201d\n\nThe state-run Saudi Press Agency carried a statement Wednesday morning quoting an unnamed official saying the kingdom had joined the International Maritime Security Construct.\n\nAustralia, Bahrain and the United Kingdom already have joined the mission.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom\u2019s accession to this international alliance comes in support of regional and international efforts to deter and counter threats to maritime navigation and global trade,\u201d the news agency said.\n\nCmdr. Joshua Frey, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet, declined to comment on the Saudi announcement, saying it \u201cwould be inappropriate to comment on the status of individual nations and the nature of any potential support.\u201d\n\nThe coalition aims to secure the broader Persian Gulf region. It includes surveillance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of the world\u2019s oil travels, and the Bab el-Mandeb, another narrow strait that connects the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden off Yemen and East Africa. Smaller patrol boats and other craft will be available for rapid response. The plan also allows for nations to escort their own ships through the region.\n\nThe U.S. blames Iran for the apparent limpet mine explosions on four vessels in May and another two in June sailing in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz, something Iran denies being behind. Iran also seized a British-flagged oil tanker and another based in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn Tehran, Rouhani told his Cabinet that Saudi Arabia should see the attack as a warning to end its war in Yemen, where it has fought the Houthi rebels since 2015 and sought to restore the internationally recognized government.\n\nRouhani said Yemenis \u201cdid not hit hospitals, they did not hit schools or the Sanaa bazaar,\u201d mentioning the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s widely criticized airstrikes.\n\nHe added that Iran does not want conflict in the region, but it was the Saudi-led coalition that \u201cwaged the war in the region and ruined Yemen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey attacked an industrial center to warn you. Learn the lesson from the warning,\u201d he said, portraying the Houthis as responsible for the drone strikes.\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcements comes after Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister said late Tuesday that more than half of the country\u2019s daily crude oil production that was knocked out by an attack had been recovered and that production capacity at its targeted plants would be fully restored by the end of the month.\n\nPompeo was due to land in the Red Sea city of Jiddah, where he was scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Pompeo later will travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday to meet with Abu Dhabi\u2019s powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Both nations are U.S. allies and have been fighting against the Houthis in Yemen since March 2015.\n\nThe Saudi military planned to speak to journalists Wednesday in Riyadh to discuss the investigation into Saturday\u2019s attack \u201cand present material evidence and Iranian weapons proving the Iranian regime\u2019s involvement.\u201d It did not elaborate.\n\nMarine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday that U.S. military experts were in Saudi Arabia working with their counterparts to \u201cdo the forensics on the attack\u201d - gleaning evidence that could help build a convincing case for where the weapons originated.\n\nOn Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office announced experts from his nation would be traveling to Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom shed light \u201d on the origin and methods\u201d of the attacks. France has been trying to find a diplomatic solution to the tensions between Iran and the U.S., so any conclusion they draw could be used to show what a third-party assessed happened.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
