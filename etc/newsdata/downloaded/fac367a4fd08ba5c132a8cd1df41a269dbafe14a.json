Experts are particularly concerned about listeriosis \u2014 a bacterial infection that can cause seemingly mild or even nonexistent symptoms in pregnant women, but which can be especially dangerous to an unborn baby \u2014 including causing miscarriage, preterm labor or stillbirth.\n\nListeria infections during pregnancy are rare. Between 2009 and 2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were just 227 cases in pregnant women in the United States. But research suggests that pregnant women may be up to 20 times more vulnerable to a listeria infection than the rest of the population.\n\n\u201cYour immunity is altered when you\u2019re pregnant, and that makes you more susceptible to serious consequences of foodborne illness,\u201d said Dr. Zoe Kiefer, M.D., M.P.H., an ob-gyn at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Nearly one-quarter of all listeria cases in pregnant women in the United States result in fetal loss or death of the newborn, according to the C.D.C.\n\nListeria outbreaks tend to occur in certain ready-to-eat meat products such as hot dogs, sausages, and store-bought, meat-based salads such as those made with chicken or ham. Cold cuts and deli meats are a common source, too. In fact, on April 17, 2019, the C.D.C. reported that at least eight hospitalizations and one death were linked to a listeria outbreak among sliced deli meats and cheeses at several deli counters across four states. Other outbreaks have been caused by refrigerated p\u00e2t\u00e9s, meat spreads, smoked seafood, carpaccio, produce like cantaloupe and lettuce, and dairy products like ice cream and soft cheeses (more on cheese below).\n\nInstead of cutting these high-risk foods from your diet completely, Mary Saucier Choate, M.S., R.D.N., a food safety field specialist at the University of New Hampshire Extension, recommended cooking foods that can be eaten hot to an internal temperature of 165 degrees, or until steaming, since high temperatures kill the bacteria. A hot open-faced turkey sandwich or a fully cooked hot dog would do the trick. Or, consider making your own alternatives, such as freshly prepared salmon salad (made from canned salmon), egg salad or a peanut butter and banana sandwich.\n\nExperts have said to keep fruits and veggies (with the exception of sprouts; more on that below), in your diet unless there\u2019s an outbreak. Cooking produce is another way to minimize potential risk, said Dr. Haley Oliver, Ph.D., an associate professor of food science at Purdue University.\n\nIn general, keeping kitchen surfaces clean, thoroughly washing fruits and veggies and properly storing them (like keeping cut melon refrigerated) can help keep you protected.", "description": "Pregnancy can be an exercise in patience: not only in figuring out what to eat and drink for yourself, but in fielding a stream of other people\u2019s opinions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/06/parenting/06-parenting-eating-during-pregnancy/06-parenting-eating-during-pregnancy-facebookJumbo.png", "published_at": "2019-05-22"}
