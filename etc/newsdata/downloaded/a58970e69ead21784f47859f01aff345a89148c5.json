Many liberal jurisdictions such as Fairfax County have sought to limit their cooperation with ICE amid anger over the president\u2019s policies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is an unfortunate issue where the officer was confused,\u201d Roessler said. \u201cWe have trained on this issue a lot. This is the first time we\u2019ve had a lapse in judgment, and the officer is being punished.\u201d\n\nPolice said the incident began when the officer was called to a traffic accident in the Groveton area the afternoon of Sept. 21. The officer discovered that one of the drivers did not have a Virginia driver\u2019s license and obtained the person\u2019s information to run a check with the Department of Motor Vehicles, police said.\n\nThe check showed that ICE had issued an administrative violation to the person for failing to appear for a deportation hearing.\n\nAD\n\nThe officer verified the warrant through the Fairfax County Department of Public Safety Communications\u2019 teletype section, which is responsible for checking on all warrants with originating agencies, police said.\n\nAD\n\nThe officer then contacted the ICE agent listed on the warrant, who was close by and came to the scene, police said. The officer issued the driver a ticket for driving without a license, which would normally result in the person being let go.\n\nBut the officer held the driver under custodial detention and the person was turned over to the federal agency.\n\nSince 2007, the Fairfax County Police Department has barred officers from confirming individuals\u2019 immigration status and taking them into custody solely on civil violations of immigration law. Individuals who are accused of crimes and are arrested have their immigration status checked when they are booked at the county jail.\n\nAD\n\nRoessler said the officer had been on the job for only a \u201cfew years\u201d but that it did not excuse the error. He said the officer was aware it was a mistake and had not willfully violated the department\u2019s policy on cooperation with ICE.\n\nAD\n\nRoessler said officers train on the policy at the police academy and during in-service refreshers. The officer involved has been relieved of all law enforcement duties pending the outcome of the investigation. Roessler declined to say what punishment the officer could face.\n\nThe driver was released by ICE after several hours and issued an ankle monitor.\n\nRoessler said that the incident was brought to his attention by email and that it is the first time the department has had to deal with this type of case.\n\nAD\n\nThe incident troubled immigrant advocates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that more training is needed within the ranks of FCPD,\u201d said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, legal director for the Legal Aid Justice Center. \u201cThis is complicated stuff, but lives are on the line and families can be destroyed when an officer gets it wrong.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRoessler said that he was reminding officers of the department\u2019s policy toward ICE and that the officer involved in the incident would go for remedial training.\n\nFairfax County has taken steps to help immigrants and cut ties with ICE in recent years as controversy has grown over President Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nThis week, federal authorities scrapped plans to put a center for unaccompanied minor children in Northern Virginia, after protests. In May, Fairfax County approved a legal fund for undocumented immigrants fighting deportation. Last year, the Fairfax County sheriff dropped an agreement with ICE to hold inmates suspected of being in the country illegally past the end of their sentences.\n\nAD\n\nLuis Aguilar, the director of CASA in Virginia, applauded Roessler for quickly investigating the incident and publicly releasing details, but he said the relationship between immigrant communities and authorities remains fragile, potentially leading to fewer people coming forward to report crimes and serve as witnesses.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is a very low trust with any government institution given the current situation with the Trump administration,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cWith incidents like this, they\u2019ve added to the distrust.\u201d\n\nOne accused teacher, 8,000 lewd images: A school\u2019s exploitation shows no place is safe from hidden cameras anymore\n\nSeveral undocumented immigrants emerge as sex assault suspects and pull Montgomery County into national debate\n\nFairfax County\u2019s Democratic prosecutor will endorse an independent \u2014 not a Democrat \u2014 to replace him\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Fairfax County police Chief Edwin C.
