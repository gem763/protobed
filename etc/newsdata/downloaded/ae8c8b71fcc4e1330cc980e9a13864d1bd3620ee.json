Here, you'll find a stunning mix of medieval, Byzantine, Neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Soviet, and modern architecture as you wander the streets on foot or gaze down at them from a cable car.\n\nWhen booking your stay, look no further than the Sheraton Grand Tbilisi Metechi Palace. This 5-star property with 220 stylishly decorated rooms, a rooftop restaurant, large ballroom, and meeting facilities is ideal for holding business meetings or meet and greets \u2014 and providing a good place to rest and recharge.\n\nHere are some team-friendly activities to try in this thriving historic city.\n\nLearn how to eat khinkali.\n\nKhinkali are traditional Georgian dumplings. Flickr / my Life, the Universe and Everything\n\nGeorgian food is a savory, hearty delight, and there's nothing more Georgian than khinkali. Dine with a group and learn the etiquette for eating these meat-filled mushroom-shaped soup dumplings: Use your hand \u2013 not utensils! \u2013 to grasp them by the twisted stem and turn them upside down. Then dust with pepper, nibble the pillowy cap to slurp out the tasty juice inside, and finally eat the whole thing, except for the tough doughy stem.\n\nHone your khinkali-eating skills at the lively Sormoni. This restaurant is wonderful for groups, offering traditional Georgian hospitality, live music, and a charming outdoor garden featuring a grill and twittering parakeets. Try other delectable dishes, including homemade cheese, a cheesy bread called khachapuri, and a bean-stuffed bread called lobiani \u2014 all classics.\n\nSample Georgian wine.\n\nGeorgia boasts a number of different red and white wines.

Learn the delicious story behind Georgian wine at 8000 Vintages, a wine bar and shop that holds blind tastings to select its stock. Its weekly wine appreciation classes are great for groups, and the sampling sessions will inspire your team to mingle and bond.\n\nGeorgian white wine has a dark amber hue and it is traditionally fermented in a clay vessel called a kvevri, while Georgian reds tend to be bold and dramatic. Trust your sommelier, or simply try them all, but don't forget to say \"Gaumarjos!\" when you toast.\n\nUnwind with a hot bath.\n\nSpas are a big part of Georgian culture. Sheraton Legend says that Tbilisi was founded when King Vakhtang Gorgasali's falcon died after diving into one of the region's many sulfuric hot springs. It makes sense then that bath culture is an integral part of Georgian life. A spa day is a must when your team is ready to hit the reset button. After all, the team that soaks stays together.\n\nOne option is the Sheraton Grand Tbilisi Metechi Palace's Spa P'Auza for pedicures, manicures, massages, plunge pools, and steam rooms in an opulent setting. For a more authentic Georgian experience, the swimsuit-optional sulfuric baths in Old Tbilisi's ancient Abanotubani district are undoubtedly the most traditional (and stinkiest).\n\nExplore Old Tbilisi.\n\nOld Tbilisi is famous for its bathouses and pastel-colored wooden houses. Getty Images The Rose Revolution of 2003 launched Georgia's post-Soviet era, and since then Tbilisi has looked to the future. A walking tour of Old Tbilisi, however, is an excellent way to discover its past.\n\nExploring a new neighborhood \u2014 especially when English isn't the primary language \u2014is a good way for teams to use critical thinking and work together. Your team will be charmed by Old Tbilisi's skewed lanes, lush courtyards, and charming pastel-colored wooden houses with lattice-worked balconies. Old Tbilisi's mosque-like bathhouses and cute caf\u00e9s are likewise nice team photo opportunities.\n\nEnjoy Tbilisi's majestic hilltop views by catching the Aerial Tramway at Rike Park (just across the Mtkvari River from Old Tbilisi) or, to get those steps in, follow Old Tbilisi's Betlemi Street straight up to the Narikala Fortress on Mount Mtatsminda. Coast back down via aerial tram or zip line. The line connects the fortress to the 300-year-old National Botanical Gardens of Georgia, but the tram offers great views over Old Tbilisi.\n\nBook your stay at the Sheraton Grand Tbilisi Metechi Palace.\n\nThis post was created by Insider Studios with Sheraton Hotels.", "description": "Tbilisi, Georgia is not that popular as a tourist destination, but it's still an ideal place to visit for business or leisure.", "authors": ["Sponsor Post", "Created Insider Studios With Sheraton Hotels"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d97aa460977cd169e050dc8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
