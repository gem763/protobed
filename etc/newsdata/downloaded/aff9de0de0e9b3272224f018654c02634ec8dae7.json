Pretty much every municipality in the country tries to exert some degree of control over what you can and can\u2019t do with your land, and sometimes I get it. Building codes, for example, are generally about making homes safer. Having survived tornados and hurricanes, I get it.\n\nYet some people just don\u2019t want you to do anything on your land they don\u2019t personally approve of. That\u2019s the fight one town had to deal with when newer residents apparently wanted to put an end to shooting on private property.\n\nThe locals rallied, though, and it seems they came out on top.\n\nThe threat of \u201csweeping restrictions\u201d being proposed to restrict target shooting on private property brought locals crowding into the Board of Supervisors\u2019 normally quiet meeting in Springfield Township, Pa., Sept. 24. Several measures were formally proposed in the meeting, and rumors had suggested even more would be. Most of the proposed items were rejected, but one banning target shooting at night passed. Cal Huntzinger, a local who attended the Board of Supervisors meeting, told America\u2019s 1st Freedom that word of the possible restrictions \u201cgot everyone\u2019s dander up.\u201d \u201cWe found out about it and we showed up in a heartbeat. I took four of my friends\u2014we rode down in my pickup truck. When I called them, it took about three seconds for them to be like \u2018Yeah, we\u2019ll be there!\u2019\u201d He said the Board of Supervisors was trying to address complaints mostly from new residents in the area who \u201cget a little perturbed when people are banging away at night,\u201d but longtime residents weren\u2019t having it. \u201cSome people move here from Manhattan and places like that, to restore a farmhouse and such. But it\u2019s rural here, with a tradition of hunting, fishing, NRA\u2014you name it. \u2026 The people complaining maybe shouldn\u2019t have moved here because it\u2019s like that.\u201d\n\nThe effort was killed, thankfully.\n\nThe township manager told America\u2019s First Freedom that it wasn\u2019t really about the Second Amendment. He argued it was really about whether the land\u2019s use was primarily about shooting or if that was a secondary use.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think that really matters.\n\nLandowners who use their land as private, personal gun ranges should be free to do so as long as they\u2019re not endangering the lives of others. As long as they\u2019re not making money off of their land being used in such a manner, there\u2019s absolutely no reason for the township to bother itself with it. (Personally, I don\u2019t think they should even if money is being made off of it, but that\u2019s another matter entirely.)\n\nNo, this was a Second Amendment issue, and I\u2019m damn glad to see the locals come out on top. It warms my heart and it gives me hope going forward that we can weather this current storm and come out on top as a nation as well.", "description": "The good folks in Springfield Township, Pa. put up a fight to keep the city from telling them they can't shoot on their property...and won.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
