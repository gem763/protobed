However, tonight a shock twist ensued as an emotional Robert handed himself in to the police \u2014 an act which left Aaron devastated.\n\nAn emotional Victoria was forced to inform Robert that rapist Lee had died earlier this week. The revelation understandably left Robert devastated, as it meant he could be charged with murder. Unwilling to let this happen, Liv (Isobel Steele) suggested that both he and Aaron should go on the run together \u2014 and the pair ultimately agreed to do just that.\n\nLast night, Liv tracked down her sibling and made it clear that she wanted to head off with them when they departed. In tonight\u2019s episode, Aaron desperately tried to change Liv\u2019s mind and, eventually he succeeded. However, it was clear that Robert could see what this whole situation was doing to both Liv and Aaron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Mandy (Lisa Riley) eventually caved and spilled the beans on Liv\u2019s location to a worried Chas (Lucy Pargeter), Paddy (Dominic Brunt) and Diane (Elizabeth Estenson) and, as a result, they set off to the cottage to locate her.\n\nHowever, unbeknown to the them, DS Wise (Neil Roberts) was in pursuit. Upon discovering the cop car tailing them, Paddy pulled over, and attempted to distract the detective by insisting that Chas was having pregnancy pains and thus they were in a rush, but it ultimately proved fruitless, as DS Wise worked out where they were headed via their Sat Nav.\n\nChas and Paddy caught up with Aaron, but as they informed him of what was happening, Robert discreetly turned himself in to the police \u2014 and they arrested him on suspicion of murder.\n\nUpon realising what Robert had done, Aaron was devastated, but Paddy held him tightly, preventing him from going to his husband.\n\nIt became clear that Robert had done this for his husband \u2014 to save him from having to spend his life on the run away from his family.\n\nThe episode came to a close as an emotional Robert was put in the police vehicle.\n\nIs this the end of the road for Robert?\n\nWill he serve life in prison?\n\nEmmerdale continues on Friday 18th October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Robert made a life-changing sacrifice for the man that he loves \u2014 but it's one that left Aaron heartbroken.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Robert-is-shocked-at-Livs-reveal-in-Emmerdale-eb86_1571335451.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
