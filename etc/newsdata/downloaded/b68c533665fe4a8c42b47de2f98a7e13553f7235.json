Kamala Harris of California, who is looking to reframe her stagnating campaign by setting high expectations in Iowa , made her Steak Fry entrance alongside a marching drumline:\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who captured 2% support in Iowa in a September CBS/YouGov Iowa poll , put on a similarly energetic display:\n\nI asked Senator Amy Klobuchar how her beer is at today's Polk County Steak Fry\u2014 she flipped a campaign stump line, telling me, like her presidency, it's \"all beer, no foam.\" pic.twitter.com/IdXuudXjOs\n\nAnd while Klobuchar has hit Trump's policies as \"all foam, no beer\" on the campaign trial, she said her beer on Saturday was just the opposite.\n\n\"All beer, no foam,\" she said, beverage in hand.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro put less emphasis on his own moves and more focus on the mariachi band that accompanied his entrance.\n\nBrought our own flavor to the #SteakFry. pic.twitter.com/pYTE44QM4W \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) September 21, 2019\n\n\"Brought our own flavor to the #SteakFry,\" he tweeted Saturday.", "description": "2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls on Saturday sought to galvanize their Iowa support at the Polk County Steak Fry with a strategy that's not frequented in the campaign playbook: dance.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190921160936-2020-democrats-iowa-steak-fry-polk-county-dancing-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
