Study: Africa Fails to Document Half of Continent's Births", "language": "en", "text": "Around 50 percent of African children are not registered at birth and effectively stateless, often meaning they cannot access essential social services such as healthcare and education, a United Nations study revealed Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking at a five-day conference in Lusaka attended by African ministers responsible for civil registration, the head of the U.N. in Zambia, Coumbia Mar Gadio, said failing to register children as citizens makes it harder for them to force their way out of poverty.\n\n\u201cMany African countries still lack adequate viable complete and digital registration systems. Unfortunately, more than half of the children in Africa are not registered at birth, a foundation for any citizen registration system,\u201d Mar Gadio said.\n\nHe continued:\n\nThese are most citizens exposed to poverty and also vulnerabilities. Not being registered, uncounted, and excluded [and] by exception, this affects the ability to enjoy universal human rights and social protection benefits. Migrants, refugees and those displaced through humanitarian crisis are in particular the vulnerable when they lack identities and travel documents. A complete civil registration system mean millions of African people have come into this world and left without leaving a trace of official records.\n\nDirector of the African Statistics Center at the U.N.\u2019s Economic Commission Oliver Chinganya gave a more positive take by noting the \u201ctremendous improvement\u201d in the registration of African children at birth in 42 of Africa\u2019s 45 countries.\n\n\u201cWhat we have noticed is that 54 percent of the countries have digitalized their civil registration across the continent,\u201d said Chinganya. \u201cWe have also noticed that 22 percent of the countries, have now managed to digitalize their national ID systems. Which is a great improvement compared to pre-independence, even some 20 years ago.\u201d\n\nZambia is one of the countries to have already digitalized its national ID systems, although the country\u2019s Minister of Home Affairs Stephen Kampyongo admitted that they are still struggling to break through into rural communities.\n\n\u201cDespite the progress that has been made in many [African] countries, we still have this identity gap which is quite eminent. This is because of the historical background here and geographic challenges we have,\u201d said Kampyongo. \u201cWe still have rural parts of African members states which are geographically challenged access. We are discussing ways and means to address some of those challenges.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, as of 2018, there are an estimated 1.1 billion people worldwide who cannot officially prove their identity, half of whom are believed to live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cThe repercussions of this pass by unnoticed and often go unreported by the press,\u201d notes the Forum in last year\u2019s report. \u201cIDs are taken for granted by those who have them. But lack of identification creates formidable barriers for each individual affected and creates even larger barriers for the countries they live in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout strong identification systems, countries can struggle to deliver vital services to people, eliminate duplicate or inefficient programs, and govern effectively,\u201d it continues. \u201cIdentification systems form an essential part of a society\u2019s foundation; building a social contract between governments and citizens requires strong identification systems and reliable databases.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Around 50 percent of African children are not registered at birth and effectively stateless, according to the United Nations.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/woman-baby-vote-Gatundu-Kenya-file17-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
