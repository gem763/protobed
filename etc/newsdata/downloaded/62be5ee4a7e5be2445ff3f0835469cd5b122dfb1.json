Researchers thought so -- although a new study published in the British Medical Journal says too many naps per week are a bad idea when it comes to lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nMore than 3,000 people studied by the University of Lausanne in Switzerland were grouped based on the number of naps they reported taking every week. Most never napped, some said they napped one or two times weekly, and others termed \u201cfrequent nappers\u201d took a snooze three or more times per week. Those with the fewest heart attacks? They were the one to two times weekly nappers. Second place went to the group who never took naps. People who napped nearly every day had the most heart attacks and strokes during the study period.\n\nBoth heart attack and stroke are caused by cardiovascular disease, also called heart disease, when plaques slowly build up in the vessels supplying blood to the heart, eventually blocking blood flow or causing clots.\n\nBut napping research isn\u2019t new. Other studies have revealed that Greeks, who boast some of the lowest rates of heart disease in the world, had a lower risk of death from heart attack if they reported napping. Yet research had only compared nappers versus non-nappers, never considering how many naps people were taking each week.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nIn the new Swiss study, \u201cfrequent nappers\u201d were mostly older men with less education, higher body mass, and a greater tendency to smoke. Even when the research took these lifestyle factors into account, people napping once or twice weekly still had less risk of heart attack or stroke.\n\nWhen it comes to naps, \"it might not only be the duration, but also the frequency that matters,\" Drs. Kristine Yaffe and Yue Leng of the University of California at San Francisco said in an editorial that went with the study.\n\nThe authors had cited other research showing naps more than one hour long may actually increase cardiovascular risk, though their own research did not correlate longer naps with higher risk of a cardiac event.\n\nBut before requesting naptime at work, remember that the most important risks for heart attack are smoking cigarettes and having untreated high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.\n\nDr. Jennifer Haythe, a cardiologist at Columbia University, pointed out some limitations of the study, telling ABC News that it \u201cwas conducted on a Swiss population and it is unclear if this is a generalizable result.\u201d Dr. Haythe adds that although she wouldn\u2019t give sleep recommendations to patients based only on this study, she does talk to patients about the role of sleep quality in heart health.\n\nDrs. Yaffe and Leng seemed to have a similar perspective in the editorial, adding that \u201cwhile the exact physiological pathways linking daytime napping to [cardiovascular disease] risk is not clear, [the study] contributes to the ongoing debate on the health implications of napping.\u201d\n\nEven within the limits of this small study, a nap could be worth considering -- just not too often. Naps aside, making healthier lifestyle choices like quitting smoking and maintaining a healthy weight should be a daily thought for all people as the dangers of heart disease loom.\n\nDr. Kendrick is a family physician with the ABC News Medical Unit.
