This is what a policy of broad, indiscriminate pressure yields. There is no room for nuance,\u201d Mr Abdi added.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The order came while Iranian president Hassan Rouhani was wrapping up his visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Mr Rouhani had refused to meet the American president amid persistent mediation by French president Emanuel Macron and British prime minister Boris Johnson. The presidential order, however, stated that it should not interfere with the United States\u2019 international obligations.\n\nBarbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told The Independent: \u201cI assume this is part of the 'maximum pressure' campaign that includes restricting the number of Iranians that can come to the UN General Assembly and confining Iran's UN diplomats to a tiny patch of the Upper East Side of Manhattan.\u201d Ms Slavin believes that this exposes as a lie the supposed US desire to negotiate \u201ca better deal\u201d with Iran, by making diplomatic contacts between the two countries even harder. \u201cPetty and vindictive like so many US policies, I'm afraid,\u201d she added.\n\nIran and the US have had no diplomatic relations in four decades and each government is represented by a close ally in the other country. Switzerland is in charge of US interests in Tehran and Pakistan houses Iran\u2019s interest section - its de facto consular representation - in Washington.\n\nThe Iranian government has a diplomatic mission at the United Nations based in New York but the Iranian staff and delegates that visit the UN are only granted a special visa by the US government that is strictly limited to a small area around the UN building in Manhattan. The limit was further tightened by secretary of state Mike Pompeo this year when the US imposed sanctions on Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, after he refused an invitation to meet Mr Trump at the White House.\n\nAs the host country of international organisations such as the United Nations and the World Bank, the US has committed to facilitate the visit of foreign delegations to these institutions. However, the rejection of visas is not unprecedented and previous US administrations have occasionally barred delegates from rival countries in the past.", "description": "Iran's economic minister has cancelled his upcoming trip to Washington to protest against the US government rejecting visas to members of his delegation.
