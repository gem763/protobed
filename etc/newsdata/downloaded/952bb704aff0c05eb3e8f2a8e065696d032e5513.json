There wasn't much he could do about it to be honest.\n\n'We shouldn't have been forced to do that. It was like gatecrashing our own sister's funeral was inhuman to deny us the right to be there.'\n\nCrilley admitted to Glasgow High Court that he had 'totally failed' his wife, after the jury heard how he refused to call an ambulance until Maureen was close to death.\n\nBy that time she had been lying on the floor for eight weeks with bed sores the size of saucers on her back, a broken leg and a brain infected with pus.\n\nShe died of spinal meningitis, but the court heard she would have survived if medical treatment had been sought promptly.\n\nThe jury cleared him of culpable homicide by majority verdict, resulting in the sisters confronting him as he left court.\n\nHis wife's sisters reacted with fury outside court. Katie Friel shouted at Crilley: 'You evil b******. You killed my sister.' Another sister, May Mackie, 68, said: 'There is no justice for my sister.\n\n'He left my sister to rot. He left her lying for eight or nine weeks. How could any human being do that? He left her to die.\n\n'The paramedics and doctors spoke of holes in her back \u2013 one the size of a saucer.'\n\nA third sister, Helen Jamieson, said: 'She was lying there and I live only a short distance away. He could have come round and I would have got help for her.'\n\nMaureen's sisters Kathleen and Helen confronted Crilley as he left the High Court in Glasgow following the Not Proven verdict\n\nCrilley admitted to Glasgow High Court that he had 'totally failed' his wife, (pictured) after the jury heard how he refused to call an ambulance until Maureen was close to death\n\nKate Friel had booked with Co-Op Funeralcare but the funeral director later told her Crilley had claimed responsibility for her funeral. There was a legal challenge but the sheriff took his side.\n\nCrilley had told the court that his wife had a fear of doctors and needles and begged him not to call emergency services.\n\nHe eventually dialled 999 on September 2, 2017.\n\nWhen medics arrived at the couple's home in Clydebank, Dunbartonshire, Mrs Crilley was lying naked on her back with a double fracture of her left leg.\n\nShe had two suppurating sores, one the size of a saucer, on her back and died at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital two days later from spinal meningitis.\n\nIn evidence, Crilley said he cooked mince and potatoes and fish cakes for her while she lay on the floor with a broken leg.\n\nHe said he had no sense of smell and did not realise how bad her injuries were. He sobbed as he told how he visited her grave every day and spoke to her.\n\nCrilley also told his QC Tony Graham: 'I look at a picture of her every day and have a chat to her, like I do at her grave. I totally failed her. I didn't know the pain she was in until I heard the doctor the other day.'\n\nCrilley's his case was found Not Proven - an acquittal used by Scottish juries when there is not enough evidence to convict but they are not sufficiently convinced of the accused innocence to find them not guilty. He is seen with Maureen in an old family photo\n\nCrilley said his wife had 'begged' him not to call an ambulance and added: 'I knew she fell but I didn't know if she had a broken leg.'\n\nWhen asked if he had wanted his wife dead, Mr Crilley replied: 'No, God, no. Maureen was my life, I will never smile again.\n\n'I wanted to look after her for the time we had left.'\n\nHe told jurors that his wife would hide her illnesses from him to avoid going to the doctor.\n\nIn 2009, she broke her kneecap and he said it took him six weeks to persuade her to go to hospital.\n\nJurors heard a 999 call where Crilley told the operator: 'My wife fell eight or nine weeks ago in the living room and this can't go on.\n\n'She begged me not to phone but she is in terrible need. She is terrified of needles and doesn't want to go to hospital.'\n\nDuring the trial, Mrs Crilley's sisters told the court she had wanted to leave her husband at one time but she was too scared.\n\nThe court heard Mrs Friel had said: 'She wasn't in touch with anyone and was in the house all the time.'\n\nProsecutor Richard Goddard, QC, had asked her sister Margaret Colquhoun, 68, if their marriage was happy. She replied: 'No, she was too frightened.'\n\nMrs Friel also blamed Crilley for not being able to visit her sister. She said: 'All the sisters went to visit her when she was in hospital. I touched her head and Neil told a police officer to escort me out as he thought I messed her hair up.'\n\nCrilley refused to comment as he left court.", "description": "Former BAE Systems worker Neil Crilley went on trial for killing his wife Maureen in September 2017 but his case was found Not Proven - a controversial verdict used by juries in Scotland.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/10/19877102-0-image-a-35_1571391364227.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
