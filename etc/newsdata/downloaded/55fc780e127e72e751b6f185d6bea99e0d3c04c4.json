Subban", "language": "en", "text": "(CNN) Lindsey Vonn, the greatest female ski racer of all time, is engaged to NHL star P.K. Subban, their representatives confirmed to CNN.\n\nThe couple met two years ago and made their relationship public in 2018. According to Vogue , Subban proposed at home, in front of Vonn's three dogs, presenting her an emerald ring -- her favorite color and his birthstone. The couple is planning to move to New Jersey, where Subban is a defenseman with the New Jersey Devils.\n\nVonn previously was married to US skier Thomas Vonn and later dated Tiger Woods.\n\n\"We're not in a big hurry to get married,\" Vonn said, according to Vogue. \"It kind of depends on his playing schedule, and when we have time to sit down and go through it. I don't want to stress him out because he has a big season coming.\"\n\nVonn, 34, who announced in February her plans to retire from professional skiing, finished her career with 82 World Cup victories. That's 20 wins ahead of the next best woman, Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria, and second on the all-time list behind Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark.\n\nRead More", "description": "Lindsey Vonn, the greatest female ski racer of all time, is engaged to NHL star P.K.
