Colorado doesn\u2019t border Mexico,\u201d tweeted that state\u2019s governor, Democrat Jared Polis, soon after Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cGood thing Colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham\u2019s press secretary Nora Sackett was less amused.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me if he really did forget about a state that he lost by such a significant margin, especially when that seems to be the only thing of importance to him and given that he can expect more of the same in 2020,\u201d Sackett told HuffPost in an email. \u201cNo one wants his wall, whether it\u2019s on the Mexican border, the Colorado border, or the Canadian border.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up statement, a different member of Lujan Grisham\u2019s press office emphasized: \u201cYes, we are a state.\u201d\n\nRoschetzkyIstockPhoto via Getty Images No wall here.\n\nSackett added that, in policy, the Trump administration really does seem to have turned a blind eye to New Mexicans devastated by the opioid crisis and others whose livelihoods depend on border trade.\n\nSo, will Trump admit he flunked this particular geography lesson?\n\nIf his history with maps \u2015 and the eagerness with which he alters them \u2015 is any indication, probably not. To that end, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has provided a preview of what we should expect from the Oval Office in the near future:", "description": "\u201cYes, we are a state,\u201d a spokesperson for New Mexico's governor said.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db0d984200000a92350698d.jpeg?cache=xfgy7gtpow&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
