Opposing protesters quickly gathered there, sparking tensions as the two camps heckled each other.\n\nThe situation turned chaotic as groups of people traded blows and some used umbrellas to hit their opponents. Police later moved in to defuse the situation, with several people detained.\n\nThe clashes amid the mid-autumn festival holiday came after several nights of peaceful rallies that featured mass singing at shopping malls by supporters of the months-long pro-democracy protests.\n\nThousands of people also carried lanterns with pro-democracy messages in public areas and formed illuminated human chains on two of the city's peaks on Friday night to mark the major Chinese festival.\n\nAnti-extradition bill protesters call for political reforms in Hong Kong Friday.

They have widened their demands to include direct elections for their leaders and police accountability.\n\nMany saw the extradition bill, which would have allowed some Hong Kong suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, as an example of Hong Kong's autonomy eroding since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nA police officer looks on while blocking the road as anti-government protesters gather in Tin Shui Wai in Hong Kong Saturday.

It is also seen as an embarrassment to China's ruling Communist Party ahead of Oct. 1 National Day celebrations.\n\nAt a news conference earlier Saturday, activists warned that violence could escalate if the government continues to turn a deaf ear to citizens' demands.
