Though Labour voters were less likely than Tories to back voter ID, 48 per cent were in favour compared to 39 per cent against.\n\nEarlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson used the Queen\u2019s Speech to lay out his plan for a new Electoral Integrity Bill.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, voters would have to present a photo ID, such as a passport or driver\u2019s licence, before casting a ballot in any future election. Anyone without an approved form of ID would be able to apply for an electoral identity document in their local council for free.\n\nIn May, the government conducted a series of ten \u201cvoter ID pilots\u201d and less than one per cent were turned away and did not return to vote due to lack of ID.\n\nThe bill would also limit proxy voting as well as requiring those registered for a postal vote to re-apply every three years.\n\nElection Fraud: Is Britain Finally Waking Up To The Disaster Of Multiculturalism? https://t.co/f4FP0HXxpT pic.twitter.com/O30U1TltBy \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 12, 2016\n\nA 2016 report commissioned by former Communities Secretary Sir Eric Pickles revealed UK authorities regularly \u201cturn a blind eye\u201d to voter fraud in heavily Muslim areas because of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d.\n\nIn the report, Sir Eric said: \u201cOur nation has a proud heritage as the \u2018mother of Parliaments\u2019, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
