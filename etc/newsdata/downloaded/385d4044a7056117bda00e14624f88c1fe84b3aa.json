It trended for hours.\n\n\u201cHas comrade Collen Oros Maine started banting,\u201d a Twitter user asked.\n\nSpeaking to YOU, the former ANC Youth League president says he went under the knife for a laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, a less common weight loss procedure, on 13 March at Netcare Waterfall City Hospital.\n\n\u201cI went there because my health was deteriorating due to the heavy [body] weight,\u201d Collen tells YOU.\n\nThe procedure involves removing about 80% of the stomach, leaving a smaller tube-shaped stomach, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\n\u201cHowever, the valve that releases food to the small intestine remains, along with a limited portion of the small intestine that normally connects to the stomach.\u201d\n\nIt also limits how much you can eat and reduces the absorption of nutrients, including proteins and fats, Mayo Clinic explained.\n\nBefore the surgery Collen says he battled with hypertension and high cholesterol levels.\n\n\u201cAnd after the operation, all those problems are gone.\u201d\n\nOver the years, he tried numerous diets but nothing worked for him until a friend did the operation and he saw the wonderful results.\n\nBecause of his busy schedule, he often ate junk food.\n\nBefore the operation the former member of parliament weighed 136kg. He\u2019s now down to 82kg.\n\nCollen is now leading a healthy lifestyle and follows a strict diet.\n\n\u201cI stopped drinking alcohol even way before the operation, so I\u2019ve cut that completely,\u201d he reveals.\n\nHe has also cut down on the intake of sugar and all the fatty food because it can cause complications.\n\n\u201cI get to cheat once in a while,\u201d he admits.\n\nCollen also hits the gym three times a week and say he\u2019ll never go back to his old habits.\n\nHe can\u2019t stop thanking endocrinologists and chair of the South African Society for Surgery, Obesity, and Metabolism professor Tess van der Merwe, enough.\n\n\u201cI feel healthier, lighter and I can do whatever I want to do now and I\u2019m not getting tired as I used to and not falling asleep easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe operation has really helped and that\u2019s why I\u2019d encourage people to try it,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe 39-year-old says he didn\u2019t care that people called him \u201cOros\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, you get called names and I didn\u2019t do this procedure because of that, I did it because of health reasons. So I\u2019m fine with whatever.\u201d\n\nCollen, who recently got engaged, says he\u2019s fully recovered and is now living his best life.", "description": "For the longest time, he was mocked and called \u201cOros\u201d because of how he looked.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9438/91b2ba40709b45e4a8bc69f9f7b87a87.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
