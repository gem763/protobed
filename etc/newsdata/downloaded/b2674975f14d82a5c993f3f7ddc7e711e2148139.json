(Don Pittis/CBC)\n\nOpinions on which ad is the devil and which the angel may be addressed in the comments section below. (Don Pittis/CBC)\n\nBest route to happiness?\n\nIt's a question many Canadians may be asking themselves: As individuals, should we be borrowing more to boost the economy? Or be paying down debt in anticipation of weathering an anticipated storm? Which is the route to true happiness?\n\nAs we head into a federal election campaign, new bits of data provide food for thought about how Canadians are responding to fears of a potential future recession that is now so often in the news.\n\nFrom the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada, there was a disclosure that consumer insolvencies are on the way up, rising nearly 17 per cent from one year ago.\n\nIt is important to realize that while the percentage increase is high, the absolute number of insolvencies \u2014 in the order of 10,000 a month \u2014 remains a tiny proportion of the more than 37 million Canadians and their households.\n\nAnother proviso is that the vast majority of these insolvencies are negotiated settlements where people have agreed to new terms of payment; actual bankruptcies are up less than three per cent.\n\nA sign of change?\n\nThe change over the year, however, seems to indicate something is happening \u2014 and it is quite different from the happy economic news of the past few weeks.\n\n\"It could be an indication of where the economy is heading,\" said Terry Goodtrack, CEO of AFOA Canada and an adviser to the government on financial literacy.\n\nBut Goodtrack says any individual statistic is open to different interpretations. For example, insolvencies may follow a period of economic optimism, where some people simply got in too deep.\n\nThe robust job creation announced last Friday was just the latest in a series of positive economic indicators; rising wages, a 3.7 per cent annualized growth rate and a resurgence in real estate sales have all been recent indicators of strength.\n\nSuch economic signals are being watched closely by the Bank of Canada's Stephen Poloz, but they will also be monitored by political parties vying for your votes. If these insolvency numbers are hinting at a swing in the economy toward gloom in the coming month, that could play an important role in an election that currently seems like a horse race.\n\nYear-end gloom\n\nA new report out yesterday from the research group Investor Economics on Canada's household balance sheet points to a different indicator on debt.\n\n\"The final months of 2018 delivered a sobering message to Canadian households and the financial services industry alike, with market concerns over Brexit, a U.S.-China trade war, and other factors depressing asset valuations and prompting a rise in interest rates,\" said Investor Economics CEO Goshka Folda in a statement.\n\nThe impact of that year-end gloom, the report said, is that Canadians have increasingly turned from tucking money away in bank accounts and other investments, to instead using it to pay down debt.\n\nOnce again, while the absolute numbers involved are not enough to budge Canadian debt loads that remain above 175 per cent of income, it is an indicator that people may be battening down for harder times.\n\nThe debt to disposable income ratio in Canada is holding steady at 177 per cent. (Jenny Kane/Associated Press)\n\nAnd it is one more sign of the self-fulfilling prophecy that can contribute to recession: Consumers borrow less and spend less. As spending falls, or in anticipation of it, businesses borrow less and invest less. And the entire economy shrinks.\n\nThat is why some economists want the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates. In theory, making money less expensive to borrow will make people and businesses borrow more, making the economy stronger.\n\nIn that way of thinking, it is Magical Credit and its abracadabra that is the angel on your shoulder. The idea of living debt-free, then, is the devil because it shrinks the economy.\n\nEncouraging borrowing with rate cuts and government deficit spending may work for national economies. But when it comes to transit ads that are likely targeting \"people who are not very financially literate,\" Goodtrack says borrowing to pay urgent bills is no solution.\n\n\"Here's a quick fix that is going to get you even worse into debt, right?\"\n\nIn fact, for transit-riding consumers, he says he's not crazy about either of those advertising messages. Instead, he said, the answer is contacting one of the country's many non-profit credit counselling agencies.\n\nFor Canada and its voters, the choice may not be so easy.\n\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis", "description": "As we head into a federal election, we must decide as individuals and as a nation whether to borrow more or pay down debt.", "authors": ["Business Columnist", "Don Pittis Was A Forest Firefighter", "A Ranger In Canada'S High Arctic Islands.
