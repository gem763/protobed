Privately held Aigle Azur was put under bankruptcy protection on Sept. 2 and halted operations days later, leaving 19,000 passengers stranded. Two airline spokespeople could not be reached and a union official said he was not aware of the court's ruling. If confirmed, it would represent a blow to government-backed efforts to sell off parts of Aigle Azur's business and save a large proportion of its 1,150 jobs.\n\nAigle Azur to cease activity on Friday after court rejects rescue bids: BFM", "description": "Aigle Azur to cease activity on Friday after court rejects rescue bids: BFM", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8Q15V_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
