But few retirees have actually continued working part time. Things are changing.\n\nA recent survey of pre-retirees and retirees shows that the gap between planning to work in retirement and doing so has narrowed. I have to confess I was a little bit surprised and more than a little pleased to see the results. Let me share with you what the researchers found and what retirement analysts say is going on.\n\nFindings of a survey of retirees and pre-retirees\n\nThe LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute surveyed recent retirees and pre-retirees (ages 55 to 71) who\u2019ve retired within the past two years or plan to retire in the next two years and had at least $100,000 in assets. Among the pre-retirees, 27% said they plan to work part-time in retirement and 17% said they expect to gradually reduce their hours before stopping work entirely. Among the retirees, 19% are working part time and 17% have reduced their working hours.\n\nThe study found an interesting gender distinction, too: a quarter of the female recent retirees phased into retirement, while just 16% of male recent retirees did. Men may be less likely to phase into retirement than women because it\u2019s harder to do so due to their preretirement job functions, the LIMRA researchers noted; 23% of the retired men surveyed worked in managerial job functions before retirement compared with 13% of women.\n\nThere are, I think, three big reasons why previous studies showed a much higher percentage of pre-retirees planning to work in retirement than the percentage of retirees who were working part time.\n\nAlso read: The FIRE movement is a hot topic \u2014 but irrelevant to most Americans\n\nFirst, pre-retirees have been overly confident and optimistic about their desire or ability to work part-time in retirement. Second, health challenges frequently prevent retirees from working in retirement. Third, people in their 60s and 70s have typically had a hard time getting hired due to age discrimination.\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on now?\n\n\u201cThe numbers are in good alignment because the pre-retirees were two years or less from retirement. So they had a pretty good idea what they were going to be doing,\u201d said Alison Salka, director of LIMRA and LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute Research. \u201cThe closer you are to retirement, the more accurately you can predict what you are going to do. You\u2019re also more likely to have been planning for it.\u201d\n\nWhy people work part-time in retirement\n\nSalka said the three primary reasons for continuing to work among employed recent retirees are: for spending money, because they enjoy their work and to stay intellectually engaged.\n\nCatherine Collinson, CEO and president of the nonprofit Transamerica Institute and Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies (and a Next Avenue Influencer in Aging), told me she found it \u201cencouraging that the gap between pre-retirees\u2019 vision of transitioning into retirement compared with the experience of recent retirees is finally starting to close.\u201d\n\nWorking at least part-time in retirement is a good thing for many retirees, Collinson said. \u201cIt enables them to earn income, continue saving for retirement and bridge savings shortfalls \u2014 with more free time for personal pursuits,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe savings shortage\n\nMany 50+ workers haven\u2019t saved enough to fully retire at the traditional retirement age of 65, Collinson explained. According to Transamerica, the estimated median total household savings in all retirement accounts among the semiretired is $216,000. \u201cIt will be difficult, if not impossible, to make these savings last a retirement of twenty-five or more years,\u201d Collinson said. And with every passing year, the percentage of retirees with pensions is shrinking, adding to the need by some new retirees to work part-time.\n\nSee: How to make your retirement savings last forever\n\nCollinson\u2019s theory on why the working-in-retirement gap of wish and reality narrowed in the LIMRA report: \u201cThe labor environment is becoming more conducive to workers extending their working lives and pre-retirees planning a transition to retirement.\u201d In today\u2019s tight labor market, employers are increasingly hiring older Americans to work part-time in retirement.\n\nThe gig economy and retirees\n\nBy 2026, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates, the labor-force participation rate of Americans age 65 to 74 will grow to about 30%, compared with roughly 17% in 1996.\n\n\u201cWith the proliferation of the gig economy and the digital marketplace, it\u2019s easier than ever for experienced professionals to do freelance and consulting work, although it still requires careful planning and preparation,\u201d Collinson said.\n\nBingo.\n\nIn fact, demographer Peter Francese recently told Barron\u2019s that he believes the current figures on boomers in the labor force are understated. Many people in their 60s and 70s, he said, are working part time off-the-books, so they\u2019re not counted in the government\u2019s labor force figures.\n\nAdvice for working part time in retirement\n\nMy bottom line: if you plan to work in retirement, don\u2019t wing it.\n\nYou need to start planning a few years ahead of time. You might need to add some employment skills, or at least keep yours up-to-date.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to network with people you know at employers where you\u2019d like to work in retirement and that hire part-time workers.\n\nRead: Social Security is a lifeline for many older Americans, but how will it be funded in the future?\n\nIf you want to start your own business as a consultant or launch an entrepreneurial effort, you\u2019ll want to gear up gradually by doing your market research, getting financially fit and laying the necessary groundwork.
