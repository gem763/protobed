As Beijing prepares to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct. 1, even the trade war will suspend hostilities, with the U.S. delaying additional tariffs. Yet one key birthday wish will not be granted: an end to the protests that have rocked semiautonomous Hong Kong for over three months. The unrest could reach a turning point come National Day, as China\u2019s ruling Communist Party vows to let nothing spoil its big parade.\n\nWhat began in Hong Kong as a protest against a controversial bill has spawned a rebellion against the city\u2019s political masters in Beijing. The bill that sparked the dissent, which would have allowed extradition to mainland China, was withdrawn in early September, but protesters insist four other demands must be met, including one for fully democratic elections. Weekend protests now routinely turn violent, with black-clad demonstrators hurling bricks and gasoline bombs, smashing train stations and setting garbage alight in the street. In response, police have started making more arrests and on Sept. 23 reiterated a threat to fire live ammunition. It\u2019s rumored that Beijing gave Hong Kong authorities until Oct. 1 to quell the pro-democracy protests, but no amount of deadlines, tear gas or aggression by government supporters has been able to bring them to an end.\n\nWith the sensitive anniversary looming, some demonstrators have targeted more overtly the symbols of the Chinese government. On Sept. 21, protesters set fire to a Chinese national flag. The next day, they tossed another into the Shing Mun River north of the city center. But the date of modern China\u2019s founding represents the biggest target yet for protesters. In a sign of just how jittery officials are about potential disruptions, the Hong Kong government\u2019s invitation to its National Day flag raising calls for guests to arrive before 7:15 a.m., long in advance of rallies planned for the day.\n\nFor Beijing, the stakes are high. \u201cCelebrations like the 70th anniversary certainly lend legitimacy to the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s Center for China Studies. \u201cThe propaganda being projected is that even though the Communist Party does not have ballot-box legitimacy, it is beloved by the Chinese people and is going from strength to strength.\u201d This milestone is particularly significant, as China\u2019s communist state has now outlived the Soviet Union\u2019s 69 years, a staying power it attributes to economic and military prowess.\n\nFor President Xi Jinping, who abolished term limits last year, the celebrations offer another chance to burnish his credentials as party leader for life. The extravaganza in store includes Xi\u2019s expected address to the nation, cultural performances across the country and fireworks. But the real centerpiece is the military parade. Some 15,000 members of the armed forces will goose-step down Beijing\u2019s Avenue of Eternal Peace as fighter jets fly overhead and 580 pieces of military hardware go on display, including intercontinental ballistic missiles and the new Sharp Sword stealth drone.\n\nBut as Xi seeks to project an image of Chinese strength and unity, the discontent in Hong Kong offers an alternative picture. \u201cUnder Xi Jinping, China\u2019s message to the world is that the China model is superior to the liberal values and the universal suffrage practiced in the West,\u201d says Lam. But this \u201cis belied by the fact that in Hong Kong, the one free place in China, the China model is being rejected.\u201d\n\nThe situation in Hong Kong also threatens Xi\u2019s long-held ambition of Chinese reunification with the self-governing island of Taiwan. Beijing had hoped the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework for semiautonomy in Hong Kong, a former British colony, could be a model for bringing Taiwan back into the fold after seven decades of estrangement. But as the framework has eroded in Hong Kong, popular support for sovereignty among Taiwan\u2019s citizens has swelled further. \u201cWe will not become another Hong Kong,\u201d President Tsai Ing-wen pledged in July.\n\nAn empire beginning to fray at the edges is not the vision Xi wants to present to the world on Oct. 1. It\u2019s still unclear how long China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong will tolerate this state of affairs. Beijing has not followed through on its threats in the summer to activate troops in Hong Kong, and analysts generally agree that the optics of a bloody intervention would have global repercussions, especially for Xi\u2019s ambitions overseas. But with the Communist Party\u2019s pride on the line, a brazen escalation by protesters on China\u2019s National Day could finally prompt serious retaliation.", "description": "Beijing will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct. 1, but protests still rock Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Laignee Barron"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u8cVVtm5kUiP6mcrF98wkA--~B/aD0xNTUzO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/e7ddd8f4fbada6b7a082c251ca6014a2", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
