It is not the role of Facebook, according to Mark Zuckerberg, to limit the speech of politicians or candidates for political office. He\u2019d much rather take a hands-off approach and let the voters choose. Almost immediately, politicians put that decision to the test, as when Elizabeth Warren ran ads about Zuckerberg endorsing Donald Trump (Zuckerberg has not endorsed a candidate). Other troll ads included the assertion that Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell supported the progressive Green New Deal.\n\nIn defending the policy, Zuckerberg has asserted that the revenue Facebook collects from political advertising is negligible and that banning political ads entirely would not hurt his company\u2019s bottom line. In a call with the press last week, he said, \u201cThis controversy is not worth the very small part of our business that this makes up. So, you know, this isn\u2019t about money.\u201d\n\nThen why should Facebook continue letting people run political ads? \u201cI believe that giving people a voice is important, and ads can be an important part of voice,\u201d he said on the same call. \u201cIn the political system, if you\u2019re a challenger candidate or an advocacy group that might not otherwise be covered by the media, ads are an important way to be able to get your message out in front of some people.\u201d\n\nIn regards to Facebook, this is something of an understatement: On Facebook, buying ads is the only way to get your message in front of people.\n\nIn early 2018, Facebook announced it was changing the News Feed algorithm to favor posts from friends and family over those from Pages and brands. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten feedback from our community that public content \u2014 posts from businesses, brands, and media \u2014 is crowding out the personal moments that lead us to connect more with each other,\u201d the CEO wrote at the time.\n\nThe result of this change was a significant reduction in organic reach, the metric that quantifies how many people see a post for free because they follow a page or a friend shares it. The opposite of this is paid reach, which quantifies how many people see a post because its placement in the News Feed was paid for.\n\nIn early 2018, when the algorithm change went into effect, a marketing exec explained to Digiday that \u201corganic reach for some smaller business Facebook pages (fewer than 10,000 fans) has hovered around ten percent for some time.\u201d That means ten percent of a page\u2019s followers would see a post on that page appear in their News Feed if the page didn\u2019t buy sponsored posts. If you were a local candidate, you might have one of these smaller pages. Following the friends-and-family change, that organic-reach number dropped to \u201cvirtually zero.\u201d\n\nPut another way, it is basically impossible for anyone running a Facebook page to reach their audience \u2014 people who have deliberately clicked the \u201cFollow\u201d button \u2014 without paying Facebook for the privilege. Depending on your perspective, Facebook is either a tollbooth or an extortion racket. Organic reach has gone down, and ad rates have gone up.\n\nAnyone running a political campaign on Facebook hoping to reach voters is forced to buy ads. Otherwise, the campaign might as well not exist. That\u2019s why the Trump campaign is spending so heavily on Facebook, and more so than any other campaign by a significant margin: More money equals more speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that there is no longer some theoretical middle ground between all and nothing when it comes to posting on Facebook. Banning political ads there would effectively get rid of all campaigning on Facebook. The possible effects of such a decision are a big unknown.", "description": "Candidates hoping to reach potential voters on Facebook are required to pay Facebook for the privilege.", "authors": ["Brian Feldman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/28/28-zuckerberg.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
