And several residents \u2013 from Scott Drinkwell (Ross Adams) and Mitchell Deveraux (Imran Adams) and Nancy and Darren Osborne (Jessica Fox and Ashley Taylor Dawson) are left facing death.\n\nA cliffhanger at the end of the previous episode saw Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) attempt to escape the clutches of Breda McQueen (Moya Brady) as she drove him potentially to freedom. She was distracted as she saw him trying to get out of the car, which led to her crashing into the crane carrying heavy equipment such as pipes and girders.\n\nStood on unstable ground above underground tunnels, the impact set into motion a chilling turn of events which will explode tonight, plunging many residents into the jaws of death. But will they be able to escape?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTonight, emergency services rush to the scene and find a terrain of absolute chaos. With Charlie and Ella missing, Nancy and Darren take themselves underground to try and find the kids. But they are putting themselves into the firing line as rubble starts to rain down upon them.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nWith several residents fleeing when the crane topples and loses control, beams and girders fall to the village below and the likes of Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn) and Yasmine Maalik (Haeisha Mistry) are caught in the crossfire.\n\nPanic ensures as the unpredictable crain rains down debris \u2013 but soon the firefighters notice that the ground is giving way beneath the crane and the whole thing could come crashing down. Tony is still trying to escape and the kids as well as Mandy and Darren may have walked into their own tombs.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott and Mitchell\u2019s secret liaison in the florist is stopped by the noise of the sirens and crashes outside but Mitchell is too scared to step out with Scott, fearing the secret will be exposed.\n\nBut could staying put in the firing line of the collapsing crane be their final mistake?\n\nHollyoaks airs the disaster on Tuesday 29th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Crisis rocks the village.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5288-HOLLYOAKS-STUNT-11-795f_1572355086.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
