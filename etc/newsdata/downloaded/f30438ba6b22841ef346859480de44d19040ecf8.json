(AP) - Public schools in Rockford, Illinois are operating without internet, telephone or computer systems that track student attendance because of a ransomware attack.\n\nThe Register Star reports Rockford Public Schools first experienced trouble with its phone and internet services on Friday. Classes for roughly 28,000 students in 47 schools resumed Monday despite outages still affecting school buildings and district offices.\n\nIn a statement Monday, school officials said experts are helping the district\u2019s technology team evaluate the outage. The district says its officials are working to get a complete picture of the incident and understand how it impacts its data.\n\nThe school district would not confirm whether it is working with local, state or federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nRansomware is a type of malware, or malicious software, typically spread through emails containing links or attachments that encrypt a user\u2019s files or systems, preventing them from accessing the information.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Rockford Register Star, http://www.rrstar.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Public schools in Rockford, Illinois are operating without internet, telephone or computer systems that track student attendance because of a ransomware attack.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
