As he\u2019s traveled around the island in Dorian\u2019s aftermath to get supplies and care for his family, he\u2019s been forced to walk over the feces and debris-strewn ground barefoot. His feet are gashed and his toenails are falling off, he says, but the 34-year-old crab fishing business owner knows he\u2019s been relatively lucky.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen dead bodies. I\u2019ve seen bodies of people crushed by debris, hanging out [of] windows. It\u2019s not good,\u201d Symonette tells TIME.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen seven dead bodies under a [shipping] container\u2026 It looks to me like the 40-ft container flew up and crushed all of them at the same time. The storm was so intense that it picked those things up like paper and flew them around,\u201d Symonette says. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine a 40-ft container coming down on you and pinning you down.\u201d\n\nAn aerial view of floods and damages from Hurricane Dorian on Great Abaco Island on Sept. 5, 2019. | ADAM DELGIUDICE\u2014AFP/Getty Images More\n\nSymonette\u2019s girlfriend, 23-year-old Dayna Hill, says her grandfather was killed by falling debris when he stepped outside during the storm. \u201cHe was trying to get out of the house when the house collapsed. First he got pinned in his truck, and once his son was able to get him out of the truck, he was struck by a heavy object that cracked his skull,\u201d Symonette explains.\n\nHill is four months pregnant and is desperate to get an ultrasound; she and Symonette are afraid that all the stress will harm their unborn child.\n\nBrian Symonette, 34, and Dayna Hill, 23. | Photo courtesy of Brian Symonette More\n\nAbaco, the chain of islands the couple calls home, is a community of about 17,000 people best known for its boat-building and tourism. But since the Category 5 storm smashed through the islands on Sunday, it seems like they are in the midst of an \u201capocalypse,\u201d Symonette tells TIME.\n\nThe 185 mph winds and rapid flooding have destroyed houses, drowned people and animals and, in the aftermath, left residents looting stores in desperation. Symonette says that the island has endured many hurricanes, but nothing like this in his lifetime.\n\nThe Bahamian government has announced that 30 people have been confirmed dead, but Hill and Symonette agree with the Prime Minister\u2019s warning that there could be more. CNN has reported that hundreds of people are still missing, and the government has brought in \u201cmore body bags and coolers.\u201d", "description": "Many people do not have access to adequate food and water, or a means to evacuate", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.p16VIYkUc2aOLE1cJG2tg--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/90d8405d5007470faa2141a95b97ddab", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
