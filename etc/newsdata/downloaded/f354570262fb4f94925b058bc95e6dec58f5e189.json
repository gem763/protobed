After the break, they mounted a spirited comeback and drew level 15 minutes from the end, with another try by the prolific Josh Adams, superbly converted by Rhys Patchell.\n\nBut the Welsh dream was cruelly shattered with four minutes remaining when they conceded another penalty and Handre Pollard landed the kick which ultimately settled this close encounter.

The countries will lock horns in the \u2018bronze final\u2019, which will be a major comedown after having their title hopes ruined this weekend.\n\nThis result is especially disappointing for Gatland as it means that his Welsh team have lost two World Cup semi-finals by a combined total of just four points. They were edged out by France in 2011 and now by the Boks here in Japan. They had been savagely hampered by injury setbacks and did not have the depth of playing resources to quite match these formidable opponents \u2013 the same nation who dispatched them from the 2015 tournament.\n\nHowever, Gatland will leave his post in a week\u2019s time having achieved many notable feats on behalf of Wales. He was cheered loudly when he appeared on the stadium screens for his post-match interview and that level of affection for his work is entirely justified. On his watch, Wales became a respected force again. He will be missed.\n\nThere was soon a clear pattern to proceedings. South African physicality. South African high kicks. Welsh high kicks. Welsh scrambling defence. It became a broken-record script. The sheer imposing force of the Boks across the field was utterly brutal and their opponents just tried to cling on in the face of the onslaught.\n\nThe two teams observe a moment of silence for the victims of Typhoon Hagibis before kick-off in Sunday's semi-final\n\nWales scrum-half Gareth Davies kicks clear at the back of the ruck as he looks to relieve some of the pressure on his side\n\nDan Biggar strikes a penalty through the posts to make it 3-3 before Pollard added three more points for South Africa\n\nWales winger Josh Adams gets sandwiched between South African tacklers Makazole Mapimpi and Siya Kolisi\n\nOn the whole, it was horribly turgid and stilted, but some rugby occasionally broke out. In the ninth minute, Wales managed to launch a wide raid down the left flank when Jonathan Davies released Josh Adams and then received a return pass, but it was ruled \u2013 correctly \u2013 to have gone forward.\n\nIt went back to being an arm-wrestle encounter and a kicking duel. In the 15th minute, Pollard landed his first shot to put the Boks in front. Three minutes later, Dan Biggar responded in kind for Wales. Two minutes after that, Pollard slotted another penalty.\n\nJust before the half-hour mark, there was another flicker of real rugby action. South Africa were on the attack, but Hadleigh Parkes managed to steal the ball and clear down-field. Back came the Boks and Lukhanyo Am and Willie le Roux combined to release Faf de Klerk on the right, but Wales once again scrambled back, held the line and hung on.\n\nPollard added a third penalty to keep the scoreboard ticking over before Biggar cut the deficit to 9-6 at the interval\n\nWales winger George North was forced off with a hamstring injury just minutes before half-time as he tried to chase the ball\n\nThe former Northampton Saints star was visibly upset on the touchline with fears his World Cup could now be over\n\nHalfpenny was brought crashing back down to earth following a huge hit from South Africa's Eben Etzebeth\n\nTempers threatened to boil over early in the second half with Jake Ball (L) squaring up to De Klerk after a line-out\n\nFive minutes before the break, Pollard\u2019s third penalty put the favourites 9-3 up and it appeared as if they were gradually, without any finesse or fluency, establishing a position of control. So much for appearances.\n\nWales have repeatedly demonstrated resilience and defiant spirit in recent times, not least in last weekend\u2019s quarter-final against France in Oita, when they appeared to be down and out until snatching victory by a point at the death. They demonstrated it again here. Either side of half-time, Biggar slotted two more penalties to level the scores \u2013 and the fly-half began to really assert himself on proceedings.\n\nAt the same time, the South Africans began to make unforced errors. They appeared to be rattled by the Welsh revival. Once again, so much for appearances. A dominant scrum earned the Boks a penalty and they used it as a platform to re-establish a lead.\n\nDe Allende had plenty of work to do when he received the pass but shrugged off two Welsh tacklers to get across the line\n\nDe Klerk (R) and South African flanker Siya Kolisi (C) celebrate after watching De Allende get across the line\n\nWales made the brave call to take a scrum in front of the posts and reaped the rewards with Adams scoring in the corner\n\nHalfpenny took over the kicking duties and converted Adams' try to bring the score to 16-16 with 15 minutes left to play\n\nRassie Erasmus had deployed his massive front-row replacements and Malcolm Marx announced his arrival with strong drives deep in Welsh territory.\n\nSouth Africa had penalty advantage but they didn\u2019t need it as Pollard carved into the 22 and the ball was shipped left to Damian de Allende, who held off Biggar and Tomos Williams to touch down.\n\nPollard converted from a tight angle and his side were seven points to the good. But Wales would not lie down and they rallied once more. In the 65th minute, Gatland\u2019s men were awarded a penalty in the South African 22 and Alun Wyn Jones boldly opted for a scrum, despite the fact that the Welsh pack had been under enormous set-piece pressure.\n\nSouth Africa took advantage of a late penalty as Pollard sent the ball through the posts to book their place in the final\n\nPollard maintained his perfect record off the tee in the semi-final as he watches the ball fly through the posts to win the game\n\nWales players look distraught on the bench as they saw their chances of reaching the final slip away in the final few minutes\n\nHigh fives all round for the South Africans as they set up a rematch of the 2007 Rugby World Cup final against England\n\nThe ploy worked, gloriously. Wales were able to win the ball quickly, Tomos Williams darted left, passed out to Jonathan Davies and he in turn sent Adams racing over for his sixth try of the World Cup \u2013 leaving him top of the tournament finishers\u2019 chart.\n\nPatchell, who had come on for Biggar, held his nerve to convert from the left touchline and it was all square at 16-16.\n\nWales had a chance to make history for themselves, by reaching the final for the first time. But the door was slammed in their faces.\n\nFour minutes from time, another Pollard penalty put South Africa ahead once more and, this time, there was no way back for the Welsh. They were condemned to another agonising last-four demise.", "description": "CHRIS FOY AT THE YOKOHAMA STADIUM: South Africa denied Warren Gatland a fairytale end to his regime as Wales head coach by snatching victory in a World Cup semi-final.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/11/20241234-0-image-a-2_1572175457852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
