The rules don\u2019t appear to apply to public hearings that the House Intelligence panel plans to hold, or to the ongoing closed-door depositions.\n\nThe rules also say that if the president or his lawyer \u201cunlawfully\u201d refuses to make witnesses or documents available for the investigative panels, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler has the discretion to deny some of their requests to call or question witnesses.\n\nDemocrats Tell Court McGahn Talks Failed (5:31 p.m.)\n\nLawyers for House Judiciary Democrats told a Washington federal judge on Tuesday that negotiations to secure the testimony of former White House counsel Don McGahn have collapsed and that the court must rule on the House\u2019s bid for a court order compelling him to appear.\n\nMcGahn spurned a committee subpoena requiring his testimony earlier this year, prompting the Democratic-led chamber to hold him in contempt and sue for his compliance. Attorneys for the House and Justice Department tried to reach an agreement, holding at least five negotiating sessions, according to a Justice Department filing with U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday.\n\nHouse lawyers, however, told Jackson in their response, \u201cthe parties have been and \u2018currently remain at an impasse\u2019\u201d regarding a McGahn interview.\n\nThey blamed the White House for insisting upon \u201cterms that are unacceptable to the committee.\u201d Among them they said, was a requirement that any interview of McGahn not be conducted as part of the House impeachment inquiry. -- Andrew Harris\n\nWhite House Says House Vote Continues \u2018Sham\u2019 (5:18 p.m.)\n\nThe House resolution to be voted this week \u201cconfirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start,\u201d White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\nThe rights of the White House in the process outlined by the resolution \u201cremain undefined, unclear, and uncertain,\u201d Grisham said, adding that the House floor vote does nothing to \u201cprovide basic due process\u201d for the administration.\n\nHouse Posts Resolution Before Thursday Vote (3:06 p.m.)\n\nThe measure says the next phase of the impeachment process will be \u201copen and transparent,\u201d led by the Intelligence Committee, according to a draft posted by the House Rules Committee.\n\nThe resolution includes six committees that are pursuing investigations of the Trump administration and doesn\u2019t limit the scope of their ongoing probes. It also does not set a timeline for potential articles of impeachment.\n\nThe measure would give the Intelligence panel\u2019s top Republican the ability to suggest subpoenas for testimony and documents as long as the Democratic chairman agrees or the full committee votes to authorize it.\n\nThe resolution calls for the Intelligence Committee to send the final recommendation for impeachment to the Judiciary Committee, in consultation with the panel on Oversight and Foreign Affairs. That recommendation is to be made public, including all attachments and depositions. Other committees would also be authorized to send relevant items to the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election,\u201d the leaders of the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Judiciary panels said in a statement. \u201cFollowing in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the president\u2019s misconduct.\u201d -- Billy House", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The House plans to take its first vote to support the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump on Thursday as Democrats seek to nullify Republicans\u2019 argument that the process is illegitimate.On Tuesday, three House committees are hearing behind closed doors from Alexander Vindman,", "authors": ["Billy House"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3sSZuHFIlKLXk.EWWd3PYg--~B/aD0xMTAzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/0015bb9f7d27119e22e23b16cde9cf19", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
