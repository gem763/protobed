When he served as vice president, Mr. Biden travelled more than once to Ukraine to strongarm the Slavic country into ousting its top prosecutor, one Victor Shoki. On his December 2015 visit to Kyiv and a subsequent March 2016 journey to the country, Mr. Biden brought with him what is commonly referred to as \u201cleverage.\u201d The Obama administration threatened to withhold aid from the country, unless they canned Mr. Shoki. A lot of aid, too: Some $1 billion in loan guarantees. That was a serious threat to war-torn Ukraine, which can at times barely keep its own lights on.\n\nWhy did the vice president want Mr. Shoki gone? Corruption, the story goes. Mr. Shoki was a notoriously venal figure, and that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t only the Obama administration that wanted him out \u2014 the European Union, International Monetary Fund and other international bodies pined for his dismissal as well.\n\nThey were probably onto something. Ukraine is indeed a notoriously corrupt country. According to Transparency International, the NGO that tracks such things, Ukraine ranks 120 out of 180 countries worldwide on the perception of public corruption. It rates somewhere in the neighborhood of the Dominican Republic, Djibouti and Kazakhstan. Pakistan, Turkey, Panama are less corrupt than Ukraine, says Transparency International. (Placid Denmark is deemed the world\u2019s least corrupt country, by the way.)\n\nAnd indeed, the appointment of Hunter Biden, the vice president\u2019s son, to a plum, $50,000-a month directorship at a Ukrainian natural gas company, while the senior Biden was still vice president, points to a country where corruption is the norm. And also, unfortunately, where competence and expertise aren\u2019t: Prior to his appointment, Hunter Biden had exactly zero experience in the energy industry.\n\nWas there something untoward in Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment and the vice president\u2019s subsequent pushing for Victor Shoki\u2019s ouster? \u201cNo!,\u201d the mainstream media and their Democratic allies cry. The Bidens have been \u201cexonerated,\u201d they say. It\u2019s an answer that satisfies only if one doesn\u2019t look too closely at who precisely did the exonerating.\n\nThat\u2019s because it was none other than the notoriously corrupt Ukrainian government \u2014 a government so corrupt, you\u2019ll recall, that Vice President Biden was quite right, we\u2019re told, to travel there and bully the country into firing its prosecutor general \u2014 that issued the Bidens a clean bill of ethical health. This is the equivalent of Dr. Conrad Murray signing off on a physical wellness check.\n\n\u201cUkraine\u2019s prosecutor general [Yuriy Lutsenko] said in an interview that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son,\u201d Bloomberg News credulously reported in May. \u201cThe controversy stems from diplomatic actions by Biden while his son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board of Burisma Group, one of the country\u2019s biggest private gas companies.\n\n\u201cI do not want Ukraine to again be the subject of U.S. presidential elections,\u2019 Lutsenko said in an interview Tuesday in his office in Kiev. \u2018Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,\u2019\u201d Bloomberg added.\n\nJoe Biden is \u2014 inexplicably, in our view \u2014 the favorite to be the next president of the United States. He leads his Democratic rivals in polling for the nomination and is far ahead in head-to-head match ups against President Donald Trump. It stands to reason, therefore, that the Ukrainian government, which is still dependent on foreign assistance, might want to curry favor with the probable next president of the United States.\n\nThe full facts behind the Bidens\u2019 activities in Ukraine have yet to emerge. But for now, it might be best to not take claims of \u201cexoneration!\u201d at face value.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
