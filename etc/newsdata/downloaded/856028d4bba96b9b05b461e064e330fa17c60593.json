Kevin Cramer Kevin John CramerLawmakers toast Greta Van Susteren's new show Maryland manufacturers are stronger with the Export-Import Bank White House officials stand by Syria withdrawal, sanctions delay amid bipartisan pushback MORE (R-N.D.), who attended the meeting, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMcConnell later told reporters that the Senate would have no choice but to hold a trial that would require the chamber to convene six days a week in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cUnder the impeachment rules of the Senate, we\u2019ll take the matter up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chief justice will be in the chair. We will have to convene every day, six days out of seven, at 12:30 or 1 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Senators will not be allowed to speak, which will be good therapy for a number of them. And we intend to do our constitutional responsibility.\u201d\n\nFormer Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), who served as one of McConnell\u2019s advisers during his Senate career, said the Constitution clearly requires a trial.\n\n\u201cI think if the articles of impeachment are brought against the president, you have to have a trial,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think it\u2019s the constitutional responsibility of the Senate.\n\n\u201cI suppose you could foreshorten it with a motion to dismiss, but that\u2019s not a trial,\u201d he said. \u201cJust seems to me that in such a serious undertaking to remove an elected official, the president of the United States, that a trial is required.\u201d\n\nThe Senate impeachment rules, as outlined in Senate Document 99-33, state that senators may propose motions and that all such motions except for the motion to adjourn shall be made in writing.\n\nAny motions made during an impeachment trial need only a simple majority to pass, and Vice President Pence would not be allowed to break a tie vote since Chief Justice John Roberts will be presiding over the trial.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat means McConnell could lose any motion where three GOP senators defect, as Republicans control 53 Senate seats and Democrats control 47.\n\nThe rules further state that all preliminary or interlocutory questions and motions shall be argued for not more than one hour and that all motions, objections and requests relating to procedure or the substance of the trial be made to the presiding chief justice.\n\nMcConnell as Rules chairman in 1999 during the Clinton trial said that a final Senate vote to convict or acquit the president could not be avoided, although he also endorsed conducting the trial quickly.\n\nMcConnell told NBC\u2019s Tim Russert in December 1998 that the Senate had a \u201cconstitutional obligation to commence the trial\u201d but that the trial should be short.\n\n\u201cI think it need not take very long. The majority leader\u2019s indicated it could be from three days to three weeks. And I think if the president\u2019s lawyers were cooperative, this could be a very short trial because it\u2019s not a complicated case,\u201d he said, referring to then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).\n\nA month later, McConnell panned the idea of a motion to dismiss the impeachment articles and argued that all previous Senate impeachment trials ended with votes on whether to convict.\n\n\u201cThe motion to dismiss is a terrible idea,\u201d McConnell said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in January 1999.\n\n\u201cTen days ago, Sen. Byrd said correctly that this ought to end with votes on the articles. All the other 14 impeachments we\u2019ve had have all ended with votes on the articles,\u201d he added, referring to Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), who offered a motion to dismiss the trial against Clinton early.\n\nSenate Republicans argue there are key differences between the impeachment inquiry against Trump and the articles of impeachment passed against Clinton more than 20 years ago.\n\nGOP sources note that the House formally voted to initiate the impeachment process against Clinton and that it was based on a lengthy investigation conducted by independent counsel Ken Starr.\n\nMcConnell has complained about the lack of due process given to Trump.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re denying due process to the president. I think he\u2019s entitled in this impending impeachment process that\u2019s going forward in the House to, No. 1, maybe have a vote on opening it \u2014 they don\u2019t seem to want to do that. No. 2, to be allowed the kind of traditional due process opportunities that we provided President Clinton years ago,\u201d he told reporters last week.\n\n\u201cAt least, it seems to me, if they\u2019re going to go forward, providing fundamental fairness and due process is appropriate,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 1999, the time allocated for the House impeachment managers and Clinton\u2019s defense team to make their arguments was laid out in Senate Resolution 16, which then-Sens. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Phil Gramm (R-Texas) negotiated and the Senate approved 100-0.\n\nThe resolution authorized senators to question the impeachment managers and the defense for up to 16 hours but said their questions had to be submitted to the presiding chief justice.\n\nThe resolution also made it in order to consider and debate a motion to dismiss the articles of impeachment, a motion that Byrd later made.\n\nHouse Republican impeachment managers argued at the time that the Senate would be shirking its responsibility if it adopted Byrd\u2019s motion and ended the trial before a final verdict could be voted on.\n\nSenate Resolution 16 also made it in order to make a motion to subpoena witnesses and to present evidence not in the record. It also provided time for depositions and made testimony inadmissible unless both parties had a chance to depose witnesses.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s impeachment rules state the precedent for the chamber is to go into closed-door deliberations after the final arguments are presented by both sides.\n\nIn 1999, each senator was given 15 minutes to make his or her case for Clinton\u2019s acquittal or conviction on the Senate floor and they were prohibited from filibustering by going over the time limit.\n\n\u201cEvery senator was given 15 minutes to go to the well and talk about their view of things,\u201d recalled former Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.).\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for senators to hear other senators to evaluate their rationale and logic and think through things that one might have felt important,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate voted at the time to conduct deliberations behind closed doors.\n\nClinton\u2019s Senate trial began at the start of January and lasted until he was acquitted on Feb. 12, 1999.\n\n--This report was updated at 8:17 a.m.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) opposed a motion to dismiss articles of impeachment in 1999, calling a Democratic proposal to quickly dismiss the trial of then-President Clinton \u201ca terrible idea.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mcconnellmitch_101619gn8_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
