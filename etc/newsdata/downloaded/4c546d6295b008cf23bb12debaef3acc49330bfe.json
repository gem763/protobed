It's a pseudo-addiction.\"\n\nMcLellan insisted the problem facing the seemingly addicted patient was that he was not getting enough drugs, Kolodny recalled.\n\nAt the time, the concept of \"pseudo-addiction\" was being advanced by Purdue Pharma and other laboratories to promote their opioid products.\n\nOxyContin, an anti-pain medication similar to morphine, was introduced to the American market in 1996 with a campaign that swept aside years of caution on the use of opioids, previously reserved for the gravely ill because of their highly addictive nature.\n\nThe campaign featured deceptive marketing, controversial sales practices and endorsements from eminent physicians generously remunerated by Purdue Pharma.\n\nBut as a result of the singularly aggressive promotion of the prescription drug, both Purdue and the Sackler family, which owns the firm, now face more than 2,300 lawsuits in the United States.\n\nThey stand accused of having provoked the nationwide opioid crisis.\n\nOpioids are blamed for more than 400,000 deaths by overdose since 1999, according to recently published data, and on average for more than 130 deaths a day.\n\nContacted by AFP, Purdue Pharma declined to comment.\n\n- A green light -\n\nThe origins of OxyContin, which has generated more than $35 billion in sales for Purdue, date to 1990.\n\nThe laboratory, based in the northeastern US state of Connecticut, was looking for a successor to its popular analgesic MS Contin, a morphine-based medication prescribed mainly to cancer patients but which was facing growing competition from generic drugs.\n\nPurdue developed a painkiller based on oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opioid first concocted in Germany in 1916, with effects comparable to those of MS Contin.\n\nOpioids posed well-known risks of dependence, but the laboratory had an answer: the new drug's beneficial effects would last 12 hours, twice as long as similar medications, meaning a patient would take fewer pills and face reduced danger of addiction.\n\nBut even before it reached the market, tests showed that OxyContin's effects did not last as long as originally thought, the Los Angeles Times found in a 2016 investigation.\n\nStill, in December 1995, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Purdue a green light to market OxyContin for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, authorizing its use for a range of ailments, many less serious than cancer.\n\n\"At the time of approval, FDA believed the controlled-release formulation of OxyContin would result in less abuse potential, since the drug would be absorbed slowly and there would not be an immediate 'rush' or high,\" an agency spokesman told AFP.\n\nThe FDA's approval drew growing criticism after Curtis Wright, a doctor who led the agency committee that authorized OxyContin, left to take a senior position with Purdue in 1998.\n\nAnother troubling development: once the drug was being marketed and aggressively promoted, OxyContin generated a huge black market that Purdue, critics say, ignored or minimized for far too long.\n\nQuantities of pills were procured -- stolen from pharmacies or obtained from unscrupulous doctors -- and ground into powder to be inhaled, which multiplied their euphoric effects, according to a confidential US Justice Department report cited by The New York Times in 2018.\n\nStory continues", "description": "In 2002, Andrew Kolodny, a resident in psychiatry, attended a training session on pain treatment in Philadelphia.
