Now, professionals in the industry are praising her for the training she put in to the role and the recognition she\u2019s given to the art form and athletic feat.\n\nJ.Lo released a YouTube video on Thursday where she gave her 11 million subscribers a look into the months of training that went into her conquering the pole. And although she makes it all look effortless, the video shares her many admissions to the difficulty of the skill.\n\n\u201cI mean, this is just as hard as anything I\u2019ve ever learned. It might be one of the hardest,\u201d Lopez said while pointing out marks down her legs and inner thighs. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten cuts and bruises and stuff from movies, but I\u2019ve never been bruised like this for anything I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nLondon-based pole dancer and blogger who goes by Blogger on Pole tells Yahoo Lifestyle that those bruises are normal for anybody spending time on a pole.\n\n\u201cThe bruises, the initial awkwardness while connecting movement, the need for an instructor or friend to spot you are something most pole dancers feel on a daily basis,\u201d the professional shared.\n\nStill, she was \u201creally impressed\u201d with Lopez\u2019s skill, and how quickly she picked it up.\n\n\u201cI have been pole dancing for just over three years and it took me a long time to go upside down unspotted without fearing for my life \u2013 Jennifer Lopez has had a crash course and it's pretty cool to see her doing so well,\u201d the blogger said. \u201cWhat shines through from her practice videos is her general dance training.\u201d\n\nWhile Blogger on Pole expressed her gratitude toward Lopez for portraying a stripper and paying tribute to the strip clubs where pole dancing originated, at least one person in the community still felt there is work to be done.\n\nAnnemarie Davies of United Pole Artists, a community company responsible for disseminating information amongst pole dancers globally, expressed her disappointment about the way that the A-lister pole dancing content is being promoted, while professional pole dancers are being silenced on social media.\n\n\u201cThese celebrities and this movie are trending and hot topics, yet the industries that this movie represents are being silenced,\u201d Davies says. \u201cSo, true skill here would be to stand up for these two industries.\u201d\n\nDavies did, however, acknowledge that J.Lo \u201clooks great on the pole\u201d and is doing her part to give dancers a spotlight.\n\n\u201cIt's so important that celebrities, who have the visibility, do right by our years of work and represent us well,\u201d Davies continued. \u201cHer technique is great and her enthusiasm to be true to pole and stripping is great to see.\u201d\n\nLopez also posted a clip of her rehearsals to her Instagram, where she wrote, \u201cLife begins at the end of your comfort zone...\u201d\n\nNow, Lopez\u2019s fans are continuing to praise her moves and feeling inspired to try the pole themselves.\n\nI thrive to be like @JLo this woman pole dancing skills are insane and the fact that she learned how to pole dance under 2 months is crazy \u2014 Kate \u2661 (@_katejimenez) September 6, 2019\n\nJlo did YouTube video on how she rehearsed the pole dancing for the movie and now I wanna try it \ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Stef\ud83e\udd8b (@stefanie___xo) September 6, 2019\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Jennifer Lopez is receiving praise from professional pole dancers after showing off her moves in a new \"Hustlers\" behind-the-scenes video.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vBWFUpoXxbjD0tFbDK2Qrw--~B/aD00ODY7dz02NDY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/9fcbb840-d0e4-11e9-9be7-e9814aa85c02", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
