It has a different library to Australia which changes from month to month. This information is only relevant to readers who access US Netflix using a VPN. Our roundup of new Netflix Australia content will be coming soon.\n\nNetflix Originals\n\nThe big debut of the month\u2014if not the year, or your lifetime\u2014is Steven Soderbergh\u2019s The Laundromat (10/18), which stars Meryl Streep as a widow investigating insurance fraud who gets tangled up in the Panama Papers scandal. Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas play the lawyers whose firm was at the centre of the mess. Ah, the \u201claundromat\u201d refers to money laundering! That sounds more exciting than these three hot shots meeting cute at the fluff \u2018n\u2019 fold.\n\nEverything else is obviously far less fun, but among the other arrivals on the N.O. gravy train are: the Michael B. Jordan superhero series Raising Jordan (10/4); Rhythm + Flow, a hip-hop American Idol-ish series judged by Cardi B, T.I, and Chance the Rapper (10/9); \u201cexistential comedy\u201d Living With Yourself starring Paul Rudd (10/18); and Dolemite Is My Name, starring Eddie Murphy as comedy and rap pioneer Rudy Ray Moore, aka 1970s Blaxploitation phenom Dolemite.\n\nMichael B. Jordan in \u2018Raising Dion\u2019 (Screenshot: Netflix)\n\nPlus, get ready for new seasons of Big Mouth, Peaky Blinders, Haunted, Insatiable, Greenhouse Academy and The Kominsky Method (already?). David Chang has a new series, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner, that sounds a little like Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee meets Parts Unknown, sort of \u201cCelebrities in Cities Getting Meals\u201d, and Gaten Matarazzo, known for Stranger Things and equally beloved FiOS ads, for some reason hosts a \u201cterrifying and hilarious prank show,\u201d which is described by Netflix as \u201cfear meets funny\u201d and good for him, he won\u2019t be cute forever, let us never speak of this show again I already hate it.\n\nMovies!\n\nThe lesser-loved installments of big franchises are coming in strong, including Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, Men in Black II. Scream 2, Superman Returns, Ocean\u2019s Twelve and Ocean\u2019s Thirteen\n\nIn the department of \u201cclassive faves that roll in and out of Netflix\u2019s lineup like a pleasant mist,\u201d we\u2019ve got Trainspotting, The Karate Kid, Cabaret and Raging Bull.\n\n\u2018Rhythm + Flow\u2019 searches for the next hip-hop star. (Screenshot: Netflix)\n\nComedy!\n\nWe\u2019ve got comedy specials from Jenny Slate and Arsenio Hall, Nikki Glaser.\n\nCiao, bellas!\n\nLeaving this month: All the President\u2019s Men, Cloverfield, Deliverance, Empire Records, Platoon, Gremlins, Hoosiers, Quiz Show, The Imitation Game and Pineapple Express.\n\nArriving in October\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of new shows, movies, and comedy specials.
