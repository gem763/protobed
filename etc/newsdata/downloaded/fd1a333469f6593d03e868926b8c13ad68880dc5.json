Judd Legum, who publishes the newsletter Popular Information, reported recently that three Republican employees in the company \u201ccall the shots at Facebook\u201d and that the social network \u201chas repeatedly taken actions that benefit Republicans and the right wing.\u201d Progressive critics have suggested that Mr. Zuckerberg is a Republican and that his company\u2019s ethos leans to the right as well. \u201cFacebook is a conservative outlet,\u201d Adam Serwer, a journalist at The Atlantic, tweeted last week. \u201cWhen conservatives criticize, they solemnly and apologetically promise to do better. When liberals criticize, they tell them to shut up.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s decision to include Breitbart among its select publishers is clarifying, though perhaps not in the way many critics have suggested. It\u2019s not an indicator of secret political bias; instead, it\u2019s a small window into how Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook see the world. Here, the realms of government and media aren\u2019t levers to achieve some ideological goal \u2014 they\u2019re mere petri dishes in which to grow the Facebook organism. And when it comes to Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s end game, nothing is more important than growth.\n\nGrowth has always been the end game for Facebook.", "description": "", "authors": ["Charlie Warzel", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Mark-Zuckerberg-Facebook.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
