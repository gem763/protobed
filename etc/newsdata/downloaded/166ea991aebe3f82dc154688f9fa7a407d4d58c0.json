More than 47,000 U.S. adults died by suicide in 2017, making it the country\u2019s 10th leading cause of death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another 1.4 million adults made a suicide attempt that year, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and 10.6 million reported having serious thoughts about attempting suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, the average full-time employee spends about 8.5 hours working during weekdays he or she works, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 most recent American Time Use Survey.\n\n\u201cIn the workplace, where we spend the majority of our waking hours, [shouldn\u2019t that be] an environment that is growing and learning and supportive of all of us taking better care of our mental health?\u201d Christine Moutier, the chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told MarketWatch.\n\nSuicide rates, which can vary by occupation, rose by 34% among the working-age U.S. population (aged 16 to 64) between 2000 and 2016, according to the CDC. Rates were highest in 2015 for men working in construction and extraction (for example, mining); arts, design, entertainment, sports and media; and installation, maintenance and repair, the agency\u2019s analysis of more than 22,000 people in 17 states found. They were highest for women working in arts, design, entertainment, sports and media; protective service (for example, police, firefighters and correction officers); and health-care support.\n\nSeptember is National Suicide Prevention Month. Here\u2019s what you can do to help a coworker who may be in crisis or at high risk for suicide:\n\nKnow the warning signs. The clearest signal that a person might be considering suicide, of course, is that they talk about ending their life. They might also mention feeling hopeless or not having any reasons to live, or even be searching online for terms like \u201cHow do I kill myself?\u201d or \u201cWhere can I buy a gun?,\u201d said Jonathan Singer, the president of the American Association of Suicidology and an associate professor of social work at Loyola University Chicago. While these signs are obviously alarming, Singer added, some people might witness them and decide that it\u2019s none of their business or that the person is not serious.\n\nOther signs could include dramatic changes in personal hygiene or substance use, or major life events like divorce, breakups, deaths of loved ones, legal troubles or job changes, said Julie Cerel, a suicidologist and professor at the University of Kentucky.\n\nSleep deprivation, extreme mood swings, talk of feeling trapped or being a burden to others, or a significant shift in someone\u2019s social presence may also be signals, Singer said \u2014 maybe this person was once gregarious at work and now seems more withdrawn. \u201cIn and of itself, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he said of the last item. \u201cBut when it\u2019s paired with, for example, poor sleep and talking about not being long for this world, that\u2019s a warning sign.\u201d\n\n\u2026 but don\u2019t lean too heavily on a checklist. Instead, use context clues and what you know about this person whom you interact with daily, Cerel said. \u201cMost people are probably not going to reveal and disclose even the majority of what they\u2019re experiencing, let alone the full extent of it \u2014 they may hint around those experiences of feeling overwhelmed, in pain, hopeless, trapped or feeling like they\u2019re a burden to others,\u201d Moutier added. Trust your gut when you believe someone is deviating from their range of usual behaviors, she said.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask what\u2019s going on. \u201cThere\u2019s no danger in saying to someone, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m really worried about you, and something you just said makes me think that you\u2019re thinking about killing yourself,\u2019\u201d Cerel said. There\u2019s no evidence to suggest that simply talking about suicide will plant the idea in a person\u2019s head, she said.\n\nIf you\u2019re completely off base, Singer said, it\u2019s better to have a colleague temporarily annoyed over your misinterpreting their behavior \u201cthan to have them be dead.\u201d\n\nIf you have personal experience that relates to their situation, \u201cbe open to sharing yours to make the playing field more level,\u201d said Ursula Whiteside, a suicide-prevention researcher and clinical faculty member at the University of Washington.\n\n\u201cYou might say, \u2018I noticed that you don\u2019t seem as excited about the project as you used to \u2014 you seem a little different. I could totally be off. But I care about you and I\u2019ve definitely had times when I felt less connected and passionate. It was hard,\u2019\u201d said Whiteside. \u201cIf you are going through something like that, I\u2019d be happy to talk about what my experience was like if you were interested.\u201d\n\nIf the person discloses to you that they are thinking about suicide, connect them with resources. Find out what kind of help this person is willing to get: Does your workplace offer an employee-assistance program (EAP)? Does this person have a therapist or mental-health provider they can call? If not, can they contact their primary-care provider as a first step? You can also encourage them to call the free, confidential National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741. The organization NowMattersNow, headed by Whiteside, also offers video-based strategies for dealing with suicidal thoughts.\n\nIf they would prefer that you tap into these resources on their behalf, you can sit with them and relay the information. \u201cYou want to stay with somebody \u2014 because this is a really intense, emotional time \u2014 until they get to talk to somebody else,\u201d Singer said.\n\nKnow when to call 911, and when not to. \u201cOverreacting would be calling 911 the minute somebody tells you that they\u2019re not sleeping and they\u2019ve thought about suicide,\u201d Moutier said. Dialing the emergency number would be appropriate if the person is about to enact a suicide method or is in the act of harming his or herself, she said.\n\nIf the person feels like they can\u2019t be safe, Cerel said, ask them: \u201cIs there somebody at home who can take those pills or put them away for you? Can we call the Lifeline or Crisis Text Line together to figure out what to do today when you get home? \u2026 Is there a family member who could pick you up and take you to see your therapist or to the emergency department?\u201d\n\nWhile many law-enforcement officers are well-trained to help individuals struggling with a mental-health crisis, Cerel said, some are not. \u201cIt\u2019s much more likely to help someone if you get them to seek help themselves,\u201d she said.\n\nUnderstand your limits. \u201cIt\u2019s important, also, for people to realize they can\u2019t be the sole person keeping a coworker alive,\u201d Cerel said. \u201cYou can be there for them; you can look out for them. But ultimately, you need to figure out how to get them to someone who\u2019s trained in assessment and treatment of suicide.\u201d\n\nKeep some don\u2019ts in mind. It doesn\u2019t help to say, \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t kill yourself,\u201d Cerel said, or to induce guilt by pointing out how their death will impact their loved ones. Don\u2019t argue with the person (\u201cWhatever is going on in your life can\u2019t be that bad\u201d) or commiserate in a superficial way that minimizes their pain (\u201cThe way things have been going in this company, literally everyone wants to kill themselves\u201d), Singer said.\n\n\u201cBe careful of assumptions about what their behavior means. Sometimes we sensationalize things we think are happening when they have to do with suicide or mental health,\u201d Whiteside added. \u201cAvoid gathering with coworkers to speculate or gossip.\u201d\n\nListen without judgment. \u201cYou just want to listen and be like, \u2018That sounds really frustrating, and it makes sense to me why you\u2019re so upset about what\u2019s happening,\u2019\u201d Singer said. \u201cYou\u2019re just having a thoughtful conversation with somebody, and telling them that they\u2019re not alone and that somebody\u2019s hearing them.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet there be some silence,\u201d Moutier said. \u201cIf they\u2019re struggling to find the words or they\u2019re not sure they\u2019re ready to talk, let them think about that for a minute.\u201d When they do start talking, use their phrasing in your response: \u201cThat sounds really difficult \u2014 tell me more about what you mean when you say \u2026\u201d\n\nSeek out training for yourself. If you\u2019re willing to make an eight-hour time commitment, check out Mental Health First Aid, a course operated by the nonprofit National Council for Behavioral Health and Missouri\u2019s Department of Mental Health that teaches participants how to respond to signs of mental illness and substance-use disorders. You can also reach out to your local AFSP chapter to learn about programs and events offered in your area.\n\nGive the person hope and make them feel less alone. \u201cKnow that feeling alone may ultimately be the biggest risk factor for suicide,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cIf you focus on it from that angle, and provide small but regular indications that you like that person, you look forward to seeing them, and you have hope that things will get better \u2026 then you can have an impact on that risk factor directly.\u201d\n\nContinue to be a friend to this person after they disclose their mental-health struggles to you, Moutier added. \u201cThe follow-up is very important,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tells the person that you do care and that you\u2019re not running away from the problem; that you can handle it; that you don\u2019t judge them.\u201d", "description": "September is National Suicide Prevention Month.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR262_suicid_ZG_20190913095338.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
