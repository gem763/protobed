This is key because Saturday is the deadline by which, by U.K. law, the government must get a deal through parliament or be forced to ask the EU27 for an extension to negotiations.\n\nLetwin says he wants to ensure there is no danger that MPs could back Johnson's deal this weekend but then run out of time to pass the withdrawal legislation before the October 31 Brexit deadline and risk leaving the EU without a deal by mistake.\n\nBoris Johnson lost the support of his informal government partners, the DUP, but he has won the backing of senior figures in the pro-Brexit ERG.\n\nThe amendment is a significant blow for Johnson, who wants to give MPs a straight choice of his Brexit pact or leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nFormer Chancellor Philip Hammond, who was also stripped of the whip over a separate bid to delay Brexit, said Saturday could not be the final vote \u201cbecause we do not know the full shape of the package.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Letwin amendment gives us an insurance policy that prevents us having to look at this bill against the constant threat of the government to pull the plug and crash us out on 31 October,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4's Today program. \u201cWe have to remove any risk of leaving on October 31 with no deal.\u201d\n\nAll Saturday's votes look very close. It is unclear whether the amendment, if called, would win the numbers needed to pass. The opposition Labour party has confirmed it will back it.\n\nA vote on the deal itself is also on a knife-edge. Johnson lost the support of his informal government partners, the Democratic Unionist Party, but he has won the backing of senior figures in the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs.\n\nHe is counting on a number of rebel Labour MPs to back his deal too \u2014 around 10 of whom have declared they will.\n\n\"I ask everyone to cast their mind forward to the end of today \u2014 and imagine what it could be like if the new Brexit deal has been approved,\u201d Johnson wrote in the Sun newspaper this morning. \"A difficult, divisive and \u2014 yes \u2014 painful chapter in our history would be at an end.\"\n\nA No.10 official said the government would \"send everyone home\" if they cannot have a clear vote on the deal, which would effectively boycott a vote on the Letwin amendment.", "description": "A proposed amendment could yet force the British prime minister to ask Brussels for an extension.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Jakob Hanke"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176824062-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
