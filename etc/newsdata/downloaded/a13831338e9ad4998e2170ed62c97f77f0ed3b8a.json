REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nThe pro-China demonstrators chanted \u201cSupport the police\u201d and \u201cChina, add oil\u201d at a shopping mall, adapting a line used by anti-Hong Kong government protesters and loosely meaning: \u201cChina, keep your strength up\u201d.\n\n\u201cHong Kong is China,\u201d one woman shouted at passersby who shouted obscenities in return in an angry pushing and pulling standoff, marked more by the shouting than violence.\n\nThe clashes in the Kowloon Bay area of the Hong Kong \u201cspecial administrative zone\u201d of China spilled out on to the streets, with each confrontation captured by dozens of media and onlookers on their smart phones. Police detained several people.\n\nProtesters complaining about perceived Chinese interference in the former British colony came out in their hundreds across the territory on Friday, singing and chanting on the Mid-Autumn Festival, in contrast to the violence of many previous weekends when police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nThey have also gathered in malls, with occasional scuffles with flag-carrying China supporters, often denouncing police for perceived brutality.\n\nAnti-government protesters were also gathering in the downtown Central district and hundreds were marching in the northwestern New Territories district of Tin Shui Wai.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep coming out to tell the government to respond to our five demands, otherwise it will think we accept the withdrawal (of an extradition bill),\u201d said protester Mandy, 26, in Tin Shui Wai, where crowds, a few waving the U.S. Stars and Stripes, shouted: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe spark for the anti-government protests was the now-withdrawn bill and concerns that Beijing is eroding civil liberties, but many young protesters are also angry about sky-high living costs and a lack of job prospects.\n\nTheir four other demands are: retraction of the word \u201criot\u201d to describe rallies, release of all detained demonstrators, an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.\n\nThe extradition bill would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts, despite Hong Kong having its own much-cherished legal system.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina says Hong Kong is now its internal affair. It says it is committed to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement and denies meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs.\n\nChina is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.", "description": "Baton-wielding Hong Kong police moved in to break up scuffles on Saturday between pro-China protesters and those denouncing perceived Chinese meddling at the start of rallies planned for across the city after months of often violent unrest.", "authors": ["Martin Pollard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429725565&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8D03C", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
