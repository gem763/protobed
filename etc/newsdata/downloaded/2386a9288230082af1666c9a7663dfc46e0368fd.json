Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) derided the event on Twitter, pointing out a clear lack of female representation at an event purported to promote being straight.\n\nFor men who are allegedly so \u201cproud\u201d of being straight, they seem to show real incompetence at attracting women to their event.\n\n\n\nSeems more like a \u201cI-Struggle-With-Masculinity\u201d parade to me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\n\nHope they grow enough over the next year to support / join LGBTQ fam next #Pride! \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 https://t.co/DUb52ktWOP \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 31, 2019\n\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh also condemned the event, suggesting Bostonians celebrate events this weekend which promote the city\u2019s values of \u201cinclusion, love of the community and acceptance of all.\u201d\n\nLet's continue to turn our backs on hatred, using our voices to continue spreading the message of love. \u2014 Mayor Marty Walsh (@marty_walsh) August 31, 2019\n\nThis weekend I'm celebrating what makes our city so great \u2013 our people \u2013 by attending neighborhood block parties, visiting farmer\u2019s markets and BBQs, and celebrating safe neighborhoods. I invite all residents of Boston to join me in doing the same. \u2014 Mayor Marty Walsh (@marty_walsh) August 31, 2019\n\nIf you want to see what Boston is all about, take a look at the events happening in our City this weekend that promote our values of inclusion, love of community and acceptance of all. \u2014 Mayor Marty Walsh (@marty_walsh) August 31, 2019\n\nThe rally was organized by Super Fun Happy America, a group which, according to its website, advocates on behalf of the straight community \u2015 which they believe are an \u201coppressed majority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe day will come when straights will finally be included as equals among all of the other orientations,\u201d group president John Hugo is quoted as saying on the site.\n\nCity of Boston officials approved the group\u2019s application to host the event in June, but denied their request to raise the Straight Pride flag at City Hall Plaza.", "description": "\"Seems more like a 'I-Struggle-With-Masculinity Parade to me'\" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6c50e22500008d0000df5a.jpeg?cache=f3lerlnk3w&ops=1778_1000"}
