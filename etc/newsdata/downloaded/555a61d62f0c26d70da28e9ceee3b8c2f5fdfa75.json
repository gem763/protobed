In the lead up to an All Black-Wales Test in Cardiff, well before the Warren Gatland-led revival had fully cemented, a columnist from the New Zealand Herald, the country\u2019s largest newspaper, questioned the status of the match. How, the Herald argued, could it be called a Test, when Wales had not beaten the All Blacks since 1953?\n\nAsked for his view at the pre-game presser, the former All Black and one-time Wales coach\u2019s response was cutting. \u201cEvery village has its idiot,\u201d Henry said. The Herald\u2019s angle was undoubtedly disrespectful, although the writer concerned could point out that even today, after three Grand Slams, Wales are still to beat the All Blacks since 1953 and are unlikely to win a Rugby World Cup until they do.\n\nBarrett brothers to make history with all three to start for All Blacks Read more\n\nBut if Wales cannot, what hope do Canada, Namibia and Italy have, in potentially lop-sided matches that might make the remainder of Pool B meaningless? Between them, the three countries have lost all 22 matches against the All Blacks, conceding an average score of 57-6. While the eras might have changed, the gap has not.\n\nCanada, who get the first crack of the trio when they play at the Oita Dome on Wednesday, have lost to New Zealand six times, conceding in excess of 60 points in the last four. Namibia were outclassed 58-14 in the two countries\u2019 only previous meeting, during the last tournament, while the Italians have lost to the All Blacks 15 times. This includes five previous World Cup defeats where Italy have let in an average of 69 points per outing.\n\nThe lack of competitiveness of many of the pool games is one of the tournament\u2019s on-going weaknesses. New Zealand have won all 28 they have played with an average score of 60-12. Such statistics are not ideal preparation for knockout play, so where does this leave the class of 2019 ahead of a three-game stretch that, while sure to be full of points, will ultimately be \u201cpointless\u201d?\n\nTheir priority will be to prepare for every game as if it were sudden death. That may be easier said than done, but that is what the All Blacks will be striving to do. It maintains their internal standards, keeps everyone on edge, and reinforces that the games are no park run around for the players wearing the jersey. For the second stringers, this will be their World Cup. They won\u2019t get to play once the knockout phase begins unless there are injuries. They need to show now they are ready to go.\n\nA key consideration for the whole squad, playing or not, will be not to take it easy. The All Blacks did that while breezing past Romania, Portugal, Italy and Scotland, 12 years ago. While running up 339 points in four games, the squad incorporated a quick break in the south of France into the schedule, prior to the quarter-final. We all know what happened next. They would never admit it, but the All Blacks got comfortable, and it undoubtedly contributed to their shock tournament exit in the first knockout round. The fact they have never pulled such a stunt mid-tournament again suggests the brains trust recognised the folly of that exercise.\n\nCanada, Namibia and Italy are not going to beat New Zealand, but they will be physical and can do some damage. Veteran prop Tony Woodcock was invalided out of the last tournament against Tonga, which ended his Test career. Dan Carter got rubbed out in 2011, albeit in training leading up to the pool game against Canada, while Tana Umaga\u2019s exit against Italy in 2003 had serious repercussions for that campaign.\n\nPlay Video 1:17 Steve Hansen says pressure is on northern hemisphere sides at Rugby World Cup \u2013 video\n\nInjuries are a fact of contact sport, but against opponents with nothing to lose and who are prepared to put their bodies on the line in the biggest game of their careers, history suggests the injury liability is greater than usual. So too is the risk of loosening up, as the scores mount, and the yards get easier to make. This is where the internal discipline comes in; where the leaders must step up, to ensure habits they reinforce at training are ingrained and that the \u201chero\u201d plays kept are to a minimum.\n\nThat leadership was in evidence in the All Blacks\u2019 opener against South Africa, most notably around on-field discipline, where they conceded just four penalties \u2013 an unheard of total, given their recent history. If the All Blacks stick to their structures, play with patience and back their systems when the pressure is low, chances are they will replicate the habit in later matches where the consequences are far greater. It may mean the scores are lower than might otherwise be expected, but if they keep embedding their game, you can expect a squad of happy campers.\n\nAt each of the last two World Cups, the All Blacks scored less from the pool outings than their historic average yet got what they needed out of the games and went on to win the tournament. In 2003 and 2007, their pool accumulations were well above the historic average, but the comfort gained proved illusionary when it mattered.\n\nThe All Blacks can\u2019t win the World Cup in the next three games but, as the past has shown, they can develop some bad habits that could help them lose it.", "description": "With three eminently winnable games to come the priority will be discipline and to avoid complacency", "authors": ["Matt Mcilraith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd035b92223d60af04b03528b3096306309e7f70/0_236_3562_2138/master/3562.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d1434894aa475fab3750671bd5e7fc4f", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
