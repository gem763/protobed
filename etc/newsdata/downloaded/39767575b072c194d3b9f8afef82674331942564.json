Watt \u2014 one of the most popular athletes in Texas \u2014 donned a Jose Altuve jersey and stoked the home crowd to cheer on the Astros. Behind home plate, the Rockets\u2019 James Harden and Russell Westbrook, two of the biggest names in the NBA, watched Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander deal. The Astros even roped in Olympic gymnast Simone Biles, who did a spectacular backflip before throwing out the first pitch in Game 2.\n\nA tough act to follow, but the biggest names in Washington sports, like their counterparts in Houston, are rallying around their baseball team as the Fall Classic shifts to the District for Game 3 on Friday night.\n\nThe Nationals are being showered with shoutouts and well-wishes from the Redskins, the Wizards and the rest of the franchises in town as the city is two World Series wins away from shaking off for good the idea that Washington teams are cursed \u2014 a meme that began falling apart when the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018.\n\n\u201cThat kind of city camaraderie, whether it\u2019s the fans supporting or whether it\u2019s other athletes, I think it all means a lot, especially when it gets down toward the end of things,\u201d Capitals defenseman John Carlson said. \u201cYou need all the support you can get. I think it\u2019s a special team over there. I know a couple of them. Just thrilled for them. They battled back all year.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals won\u2019t be in attendance for any of the home games this weekend as they\u2019re on a road trip in Canada. But that hasn\u2019t stopped them from vocalizing their support.\n\nThe NHL team awards a Nationals batting helmet to recognize a standout performer after every game. Star Alex Ovechkin, too, tossed out the first pitch earlier this postseason.\n\nAnother Washington champion, WNBA MVP Elena Delle Donne, threw out the first pitch in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series earlier this month.\n\nThis week, across social media, the Redskins, Capitals and Wizards have all sent supportive messages wishing the Nationals good luck at the start of the World Series. The Redskins even made a video featuring eight different players \u2014 including running back Derrius Guice and safety Landon Collins \u2014 rooting the Nationals on.\n\n\u201cShout out to the Nats,\u201d Guice said. \u201cBest baseball team in the country.\u201d\n\nSince taking over as interim coach earlier this month, Bill Callahan has opened two of his press conferences to talk at length about the Nationals. First, he congratulated them on advancing past the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. He highlighted the coaching job of manager Dave Martinez, adding he loves baseball.\n\nThen when the Nationals swept the St.Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, Callahan again congratulated the team \u2014 noting the son of Redskins director of football operations Paul Kelly is a batboy for the Nationals. \u201cit was great to see him on the tube last night celebrating,\u201d Callahan said.\n\nIt is unknown how many Redskins plan to attend the games this weekend. They return from Minnesota on Friday, so some players should be available to go.\n\nRedskins cornerback Josh Norman arrived to U.S. Bank Stadium in a customized Nationals\u2019 jersey.\n\nOn Twitter, Guice tweeted Thursday \u201cYessir go @Nationals\u201d when a fan asked him if he\u2019d be at Nationals Park this weekend. He also followed it up by asking, \u201cWhere them Astros fans that was talking that smack?\u201d\n\nHours later, Guice also tweeted: \u201cWho got some Nationals tickets? Asking for a friend.\u201d\n\nIf the 22-year-old does intend to buy tickets, good luck. According to StubHub, the average price of tickets sold on the secondary market for Game 3 has been $1,286.\n\nAs for the Wizards, they\u2019re on the road. They play in San Antonio on Saturday. But the team\u2019s social media account tweeted after the Nationals won Games 1 and 2, including GIFs of Sean Doolittle and Juan Soto celebrating.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
