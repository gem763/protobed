Then I see that St. Louis King of France came together today to support the movement!\u201d he said alongside a photo of a playground full of children at the local Catholic school wearing home-made versions of the headband.\n\n\u201cLook at all these beautiful children of God. Always glory above so I\u2019m taking every penny of that original $7,017 fine and donating it to [St. Dominic\u2019s Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi] anyways,\u201d Davis concluded.\n\nDavis was fined over the weekend for wearing the headband during the third game of the season against Seattle, in what he said was a fundraiser for the emergency department of the hospital in his home state.\n\nAccording to Tuesday evening\u2019s Instagram post, the kerfuffle over the fine, which had prompted an earlier post in which Davis has asked his followers whether he should continue to wear it, had sparked huge sales of the \u201cMan of God\u201d and related \u201cWoman of God\u201d headbands.\n\n\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve raised over $30,000 for them from the headbands!! That means yall helped me turn a $7,000 negative into an almost $40,000 positive benefiting people who truly need it!!! Do y\u2019all see how that worked?? \u2026 Y\u2019all are a part of this journey too!! I can\u2019t thank y\u2019all enough either \u2026 I\u2019m truly blessed as anybody,\u201d he concluded.\n\nDavis added that \u201cChild of God\u201d pieces and color options have since been added and encouraged his followers to continue purchasing them, providing a link to do so.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
