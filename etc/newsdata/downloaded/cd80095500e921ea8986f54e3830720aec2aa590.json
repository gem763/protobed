Screenshots later emerged which suggested that this touchless mode was destined for feature phones. However, as of earlier this month Google appeared to be removing this code, suggesting that it has shelved or rolled back its plans.\n\nGoogle recently invested in KaiOS, a competing feature phone operating system\n\nAs well as apps like Google Maps, YouTube, and Facebook, the prototype device also seems to have an app called Proxx installed, which 9to5Google notes is a Minesweeper clone that Google detailed earlier this year at its Google I/O conference. The app was meant to show off how to design an app that can scale from desktops right down to simple feature phones, like the one in this video.\n\nThe device\u2019s settings screen lists the version of Android it\u2019s running as version 8.1, and describes the phone as \u201cIron GAFP\u201d as the type of device. 9to5Google speculates that this could stand for \u201cGoogle Android Feature Phone.\u201d\n\nWithout official confirmation from Google that its feature phone operating system existed in the first place, it\u2019s difficult to know why it might be ceasing development. However, last year the company invested $22 million in KaiOS, an alternative feature phone operating system based on the discontinued Firefox OS. KaiOS\u2019s website lists most of the major apps seen in the leaked video of Google\u2019s feature phone OS, including Google Maps, YouTube, Facebook, and the Google Assistant. WhatsApp is also compatible with the operating system.\n\nWith KaiOS already offering access to Google\u2019s apps and services on feature phones, Google could have reasoned that it had little to gain from developing a feature phone operating system of its own, meaning this video might be the closest we get to a true Android feature phone OS.", "description": "A video, which allegedly shows off Google\u2019s unreleased version of Android for feature phones, has been posted online.
