The pound was last quoted at $1.2604 versus the dollar, little changed on the day.\n\nA deal to smooth Britain's departure from the EU hung in the balance on Monday after diplomats indicated the bloc wanted more concessions from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and said a full agreement was unlikely this week.\n\nJohnson says he wants to strike an exit deal at an EU summit on Thursday and Friday to allow an orderly departure on Oct. 31. If an agreement is not possible, he says he will lead the United Kingdom out of the club it joined in 1973 without a deal - even though parliament has passed a law saying he cannot do so.\n\nThe lira showed limited reaction after Trump imposed new sanctions on Turkey, but the currency stayed near seven-week lows against the dollar on concerns about a fallout from the country's incursion in northern Syria.\n\nIn early Asia, the lira stood at 5.9239 per dollar , after having weakened some 0.8% on Monday.", "description": "Dollar loses steam versus yen as trade deal, Brexit hopes face reality check", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E01A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
