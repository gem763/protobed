Apple's first product to connect to 5G. Will ship 5.4-inch and 6.7-inch models. Manufacturing costs could rise 50%. Will use Qualcomm's 5G modems. Expect to ship 85 million at launch. Similar to current iPad Pro design.\n\nThe iPhone 4's iconic design caused a number of headaches for the firm originally. When held in a particular way, users could unintentionally 'bridge' the two separate antennae\u2014WiFi and Bluetooth on the left, and cellular on the right\u2014causing signal interference and dropped calls.\n\nAccording to Kuo, Apple has been experimenting with a number of ways to ensure the newest model doesn't suffer the same receptivity issues, including using sapphire or tempered glass around the phone's grooves.\n\nThese measures could add as much as 50 percent to the company's manufacturing cost for the frame.\n\nIt's unclear whether those costs will affect the retail price of Apple's devices, the prices for which have risen significantly since the iPhone 4's release.\n\nThe current price range starts at $699 for a basic iPhone 11 to $1099 for an iPhone Pro Max.\n\nBack in 2010, an unlocked 16GB iPhone 4 went for $599 when it launched in 2010, while an upgraded 32GB version went for $699.\n\nThe previous year's 3G model was discounted to $499 and offered as a low cost option.\n\nThe just released iPhone 11 range was Apple's most expensive yet, with the 512GB iPhone Pro Max costing $1449.\n\nAccording to Kuo, Apple expects demand for the new devices to be significantly higher than this years model. Early estimates suggest the company plans to ship 85 million units of the 5G models, compared to 75 million units of this year's models.", "description": "A new research note from Hong Kong analyst claims next year's iPhone will feature an updated form factor, similar to the iPhone 4.
