Over the next two weeks, circumstances will inevitably change.\"\n\nHe said the \"normal course\" would be to dismiss the petition, but this would leave little time for the campaigners to lodge a new one in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to comply with the Benn Act.\n\nThe judges therefore continued the case until 21 October, because \"the position ought to be significantly clearer\" by then.\n\nMs Cherry said the delay was a \"victory\" for her side, and that the judges had \"given the prime minister time to fulfil the promise he made to the court\".\n\nWhat is the nobile officium?\n\nThe procedure of petitioning the nobile officium is unique to Scots law, but is far from being a forgotten backwater of the legal system.\n\nIts name is a Latin term meaning the \"noble office\".\n\nThe procedure offers the opportunity to provide a remedy in a legal dispute where none exists.\n\nIn other words, it can plug any gap in the law or offer mitigation if the law, when applied, would be seen to be too strict.\n\nIn this case, it would see an official of the court sign a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit extension, as set out in the Benn Act, should the prime minister refuse to.", "description": "Campaigners want Scottish judges to sign a letter requesting a Brexit extension if Boris Johnson refuses to do so.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/116B2/production/_109164317_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
