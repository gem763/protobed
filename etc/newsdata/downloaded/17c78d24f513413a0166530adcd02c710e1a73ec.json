Its total investment income was fell 40.7% to $67.84 billion.\n\n\u201cThe global economy and financial situation is complex, international capital markets are in turmoil, the risk for assets is growing,\u201d said Chairman Peng Chun, who described the current Sino-U.S. relationship as \u201cdelicate\u201d.\n\nThe fund \u201cfeels a lot of pressure,\u201d Peng said, adding CIC\u2019s long-term returns outlook is stable.\n\nCIC booked a minus 2.35% net return on overseas investments last year, versus 17.59% in 2017. However, its annualized accumulative investment return for 2008 to 2018 was 6.07%, exceeding the fund\u2019s performance review target, Peng said.\n\nThe fund has invested in 44 projects worth $26 billion under the government\u2019s Belt and Road international trade route initiative as at the end of August, said Ju.\n\n\u201cSome countries have tightened their investment oversight,\u201d said Peng, adding Chinese investment entities have faced prejudicial treatment due to increased protectionism.\n\nCIC neverthelss plans to actively engage in cross-border investment such as multilateral funds, Peng said.\n\nHeadquartered in Beijing, CIC was founded in 2007 to help China earn a higher return on its foreign exchange reserves. It managed 4.3 trillion yuan ($607.01 billion) worth of state assets as at the end of 2018, its earnings report showed.\n\nRISK RESOLUTION\n\nDomestically, CIC plans to strengthen its role in the management of state-owned assets, said Peng, and the most important part of that role is to minimize financial risk.\n\nEarlier this year, through CIC unit Central Huijin Investment Ltd, the fund said it will act as a strategic investor in struggling Hengfeng Bank, as part of a state rescue initiative to support highly indebted smaller banks and contain financial risk.\n\nAsked about Central Huijin\u2019s future rescue plans, Peng said: \u201cCIC will step up its role as a platform to resolve and rescue high-risk institutions through market-oriented ways. Resolving financial risks is a new norm and will be a long-term job for us.\u201d\n\nHe said such rescue efforts would not change the market position of Central Huijin.", "description": "China Investment Corp (CIC) reported a 37% dive in annual profit on Friday and said the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war has made the Chinese sovereign wealth fund more cautious about investing in the United States.", "authors": ["Cheng Leng", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
