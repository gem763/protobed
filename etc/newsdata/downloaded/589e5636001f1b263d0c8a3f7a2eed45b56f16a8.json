They failed to anticipate that, for the poor and middle class, work would remain a necessity; but for the college-educated elite, it would morph into a kind of religion, promising identity, transcendence, and community. Call it workism.\n\n1. THE GOSPEL OF WORK\n\nThe decline of traditional faith in America has coincided with an explosion of new atheisms. Some people worship beauty, some worship political identities, and others worship their children. But everybody worships something. And workism is among the most potent of the new religions competing for congregants.\n\nWhat is workism? It is the belief that work is not only necessary to economic production, but also the centerpiece of one\u2019s identity and life\u2019s purpose; and the belief that any policy to promote human welfare must always encourage more work.\n\nHomo industrious is not new to the American landscape. The American dream\u2014that hoary mythology that hard work always guarantees upward mobility\u2014has for more than a century made the U.S. obsessed with material success and the exhaustive striving required to earn it.\n\nNo large country in the world as productive as the United States averages more hours of work a year. And the gap between the U.S. and other countries is growing. Between 1950 and 2012, annual hours worked per employee fell by about 40 percent in Germany and the Netherlands\u2014but by only 10 percent in the United States. Americans \u201cwork longer hours, have shorter vacations, get less in unemployment, disability, and retirement benefits, and retire later, than people in comparably rich societies,\u201d wrote Samuel P. Huntington in his 2005 book Who Are We?: The Challenges to America\u2019s National Identity.\n\nOne group has led the widening of the workist gap: rich men.\n\nIn 1980, the highest-earning men actually worked fewer hours per week than middle-class and low-income men, according to a survey by the Minneapolis Fed. But that\u2019s changed. By 2005, the richest 10 percent of married men had the longest average workweek. In that same time, college-educated men reduced their leisure time more than any other group. Today, it is fair to say that elite American men have transformed themselves into the world\u2019s premier workaholics, toiling longer hours than both poorer men in the U.S. and rich men in similarly rich countries.\n\nThis shift defies economic logic\u2014and economic history. The rich have always worked less than the poor, because they could afford to. The landed gentry of preindustrial Europe dined, danced, and gossiped, while serfs toiled without end. In the early 20th century, rich Americans used their ample downtime to buy weekly movie tickets and dabble in sports. Today\u2019s rich American men can afford vastly more downtime. But they have used their wealth to buy the strangest of prizes: more work!", "description": "For the college-educated elite, work has morphed into a religious identity\u2014promising transcendence and community, but failing to deliver.", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTX9YBO/facebook.jpg?1550863879", "published_at": "2019-02-24"}
