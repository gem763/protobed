Here's why", "language": "en", "text": "Just don't post videos of your kids on YouTube. Here's why\n\nSickos have been trading contact information, providing links to child porn, sharing videos in secret and time-stamping videos where they find a child in a compromising position. And honestly, YouTube isn't acting fast enough.\n\nWARNING: This story may be upsetting to some readers.\n\nWe recently wrote about how YouTube\u2019s become a platform to condition and torment little kids with copy-cat content of a violent and sexual nature. The latest video we came across even featured anti-PC Filthy Frank, sharing suicide tips with kids.\n\nRead the full video here: Moms and dads, the YouTube videos your kids are watching may be interrupted by suicide tips\n\n\n\nNow, not only do you have to worry about the videos your kids are watching, but also the videos you post online of your family. Because sickos have been lurking on YouTube, watching your most cherished videos of your kids and getting their kicks in the comments section.\n\n\n\nYouTuber Matt Watson recently posted a video in which he goes down a wormhole and investigates YouTube\u2019s apparent exploitation of children, describing the platform as one where a \u201csoft-core pedophile ring\u201d is operating, by means of flooding videos of children with predatory comments.\n\nOne such practice comes in the form of trading contact information, providing links to child porn, sharing videos in secret and time-stamping specific places in a video where they may find a child in an inappropriate, compromising position.\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nJeepers, what's going on with YouTube?\n\n\u201cThis is f*cking disgusting. This is so wrong.\u201d Those are Watson\u2019s words \u2013 ours may be slightly more profane.\n\nIn his video, Watson shows how searching for something like \u201cbikini haul\u201d can lead you to inappropriate content after just two clicks. It\u2019s that simple. Soon enough, through YouTube\u2019s algorithm that identifies content you may be interested in seeing, you\u2019ll have video after video of little girls waiting for you in the sidebar.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. You\u2019re in and YouTube will actually tailor your experience and feed you videos of the exact same kind.\n\nThese videos show younger tweens and teens, in what is probably just them in their awkward phase shooting a tutorial or making an innocent gymnastics video. But once you scroll down to the comments, you\u2019ll see text that\u2019s difficult to make out or in another language, compliments you just shouldn\u2019t be paying young girls (\u201cShe\u2019ll make a great mother some time\u201d) or the more disturbing \u201cWOW yaaa\u201d, followed by three water droplet emojis. Yeah. You'll also find timestamps of exactly when in the video they gymnast happens to have her legs open or she\u2019s licking a popsicle.\n\nOne Redditor working as an animator at a tech company shared his creepy story online. Brace yourself \u2013 this is a doosy.\n\n\n\nHe explained that he used to animate parts of videos \u2013 never a full video \u2013 of popular children\u2019s characters. The company in itself was pretty creepy \u2013 we're talking restricted-access-to-doors and scary-emails-of-children-being-tortured-in-dark-rooms creepy. But it wasn\u2019t until some months later when he saw his niece browsing YouTube videos online that he realised just how creepy the videos he was working on were. He recognised the parts that he edited, but once he saw the video in full he noticed they all had common themes of sex and violence.\n\n\n\n\u201cCreators want to normalise [these themes],\u201d he tried to explain. \u201cThey want kids to be desensitised to sex and violence. Maybe even curious about them.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut he continued, \u201cThe comments in the videos reveal that a lot of the viewers are adults, and fetishists. Perverts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey really, really enjoy the videos of kids being kidnapped and tied up,\u201d he explained, touching on something he encountered at the company he\u2019d then already left. \u201cThey beg for more and offer to support via crowdfunding.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThese videos are designed to groom children, and satisfy perverts.\u201d\n\nWhat is YouTube doing about all this?\n\nTo make matters worse, these videos are being monetised. That means YouTube is actually putting ads on these videos, and sharing in the profits with the channel creators.\n\nBusiness Insider reported since the scandal broke, major advertisers such as Disney and Fortnite\u2019s Epic Games have pulled advertising with the platform.\n\n\n\nYouTube commented on a video posted by another user, Philip DeFranco, in which he defended the video platform's efforts:\n\n\u201cIn the last 48 hours, beyond our normal protections we\u2019ve disabled comments on tens of millions of videos. We've also terminated over 400 channels for the comments they left on videos, and reported illegal comments to law enforcement. There is more to be done and we are continuing to grow our team in order to keep people safe.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: @YouTube @YTCreators left a comment and provided an update on what they\u2019ve done to combat horrible people on the site in the last 48 hours.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Disabled comments on tens of millions of videos. Terminated over 400 channels. Reported illegal comments to law enforcement. pic.twitter.com/zFHFfkX9FD \u2014 Philip DeFranco (@PhillyD) February 21, 2019\n\nYouTube also wrote, in 2017 already (yes, this saga\u2019s been going on for quite some time), that they\u2019re doing their utmost to ensure all inappropriate comments on videos of minors are removed, and they have an algorithm in place to identify when the need arises.\n\nBut, Watson points out, once a predator manoeuvres his way in, there\u2019s just video after video of innocent little girls, with parents who have absolutely no idea what\u2019s going on, \"and not a damn thing is being done about it,\" he insists.\n\nWe know from past experience that once you report a video for having inappropriate content, YouTube doesn\u2019t immediately remove it and more often than not, the same content just pops up on another channel. One of our readers, Claire Perry, also wrote in and flagged the fact that after she\u2019d done the same, YouTube simply suggested she make use of the parental control.\n\nThat\u2019s all good and well, YouTube, if only it actually worked and the same content wasn\u2019t also popping up on YouTube Kids \u2013 the app you created to ensure a \"safer and simpler\" world for kids, specifically.\n\nChat back:\n\nHave you come across anything disturbing in the comments section on YouTube? Do you put videos of your children at home or at school or at church on YouTube? Tell us and we may write about.\n\nAlso read:", "description": "Sickos have been trading contact information, providing links to child porn, sharing videos in secret and time-stamping videos where they find a child in a compromising position.
