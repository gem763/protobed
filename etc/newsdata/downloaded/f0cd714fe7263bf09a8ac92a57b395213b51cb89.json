He did not offer specific numbers or say precisely when they'd go, but he did say there would be air and missile defense units.\n\nWhen asked how many troops were going overseas, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford said \u201cnot thousands,\u201d and added there had been \u201cno decision on specific units.\u201d\n\nEsper said this was a first step toward addressing Iran's increasingly violent acts in the region -- including the recent drone attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities -- and he called on other nations to step up and condemn the attacks.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest oil processing plant and a major oil field in Saudi Arabia were hit by a massive drone attack on Saturday. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack, but the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran directly. Iran denied involvement in the attack.\n\n\u201cIt is clear [\u2026] that the weapons used were Iranian-produced and were not launched from Yemen,\u201d Esper said Friday. He and Dunford gave an unscheduled press conference after meeting with President Trump earlier in the day.\n\nAll signs indicate \u201cIran was responsible for the attack,\u201d Esper said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. does not seek conflict with Iran,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat said, we have many other military options available if necessary.\u201d\n\nIRAN WARNS OF \u2018ALL-OUT WAR\u2019 IF US RETALIATES IN WAKE OF SAUDI OIL FACILITY BOMBINGS\n\nOfficials said the U.S. urges Iran to immediately cease its aggressive and destabilizing activities in the region.\n\nThe Kingdom has \u201cfull U.S. commitment\u201d to help defend Saudi Arabia and its oil infrastructure, they noted.\n\nDunford said a \"moderate\" amount of troops would deploy. Defense officials told Fox News on Thursday that the Trump administration was weighing the option to send more troops to the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWe have a robust presence in the Gulf already,\u201d Esper said. \u201cWe feel quite confident in terms of our own defense posture and the ability to do anything else as necessary.\u201d\n\nThere are 70,000 service members stationed in the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned on Thursday that there could be an \"all-out war\u201d that would cause \u201ca lot of casualties\u201d if Tehran is attacked in retaliation for the bombings of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\n\"I am making a very serious statement that we don't want to engage in a military confrontation,\" Zarif told CNN. \"But we won't blink to defend our territory.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo had tweeted a day before that the \u201cIranian regime's threatening behavior will not be tolerated,\u201d calling the bombings an \u201cact of war.\u201d\n\nPOMPEO ACCUSES IRAN OF \u2018UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK\u2019 AFTER DRONES HIT SAUDI OIL FACILITIES\n\nTrump said earlier this week it was \u201clooking like\u201d Iran was responsible for the attack but stopped short of directly accusing Tehran.\n\nThe Saudis on Wednesday displayed what they said were Iranian weapons collected after the attack and showed video footage of what was said to be a drone coming in from the north. However, Yemen \u2013 where Houthi rebels are \u2013 is south of the country.\n\nA Saudi military official said 18 drones and seven cruise missiles were launched, with three missiles failing to hit their targets. The missiles were said to have a range of 435 miles, which weapons experts told The Associated Press could not have been fired from Yemen.\n\nFox News\u2019 Lucas Tomlinson, Edmund DeMarche, Sam Dorman, Greg Norman and Morgan Phillips contributed to this report, as well as The Associated Press.", "description": "The U.S. will deploy more troops\u00a0to the Middle East in\u00a0order to deter Iran's increasingly aggressive behavior in the region,\u00a0top military officials said Friday night.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/pentagon092019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
