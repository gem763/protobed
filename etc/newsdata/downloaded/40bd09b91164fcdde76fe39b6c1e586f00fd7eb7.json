It was a game where you didn\u2019t guide the affairs of nations and empires, except as they incidentally became the affairs of your individual ruler, their heir, and their extended family. Full of intrigues and murderous plots around courts of corrupt and incompetent nobles, Crusader Kings 2 could be played as a strategy game, or as a narrative sandbox.\n\nNow, at this year\u2019s PDXCON, Paradox has announced that Crusader Kings 3 will come out for PC in 2020, and will also be included on Xbox Game Pass for PC.\n\nThe biggest, most noticeable change is that the small 2D character portraits from CK2 have been replaced with full 3D, animated models.\n\nOther features include, from the press release:\n\nShape Your Dynasty: Guide unique characters through history, choosing lifestyles best suited to their personalities and your ambitions.\n\nRewrite Medieval History: Dynasties will change and adapt to changes in family and politics, and religious beliefs are more firmly under your control.\n\nBuild a Mighty Kingdom: Use your vassals\u2019 fear of you as a weapon or call on familial obligations to persuade reluctant relatives to submit.\n\nExperience High Drama: Stranger than fiction stories leap off the screen, as characters plot against you and events push you to extremes.\n\nLearn as You Go: Guided advice to help newcomers navigate a rich medieval world. In-game suggestions tip you off to paths you might not have considered.\n\nThe Usual Crusader Kings Fun: Keep a stubborn council in line, scheme against your overbearing uncle or marry the rich duchy...oops, I mean pious duke or duchess of your dreams.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Paradox are aware of how unique a success CK2 was, and are hoping to build on that with this new edition. Again, from the press release:\n\n\u201cCrusader Kings III is a grand medieval simulator where you are free to live out any plausible ruler fantasy that we could think of - but not without challenge.\u201d says Henrik F\u00e5hraeus, the Game Director. \u201cSeeing its predecessor explode in popularity was very satisfying, especially considering that user friendliness was never our primary goal. Now we have a chance to address an even larger audience.\u201d", "description": "Paradox's new dynastic strategy game switches to 3D character models and has a focus on approachability and user-friendliness", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daace9e8434b4000a444ae9/lede/1571476410303-Titus_1920x1080.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
