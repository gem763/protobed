Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nStill, Barclay staked a decent claim on Monday before the House of Lords EU Select Committee. Under Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, asked Lord Wood (former Gordon Brown adviser Stewart Wood as was, and one of the heroes of the resistance), will Northern Ireland businesses need to fill out export forms when they send goods to the British mainland?\n\nThat was not an arcane enquiry. The answer must have appeared, in bold type, on the page at the top of his red box pile. It\u2019s crucial. It goes to the heart of the conundrum: will Britain treat Northern Ireland as a foreign country by imposing a customs border, with colossal implications not only for the DUP\u2019s immediate voting intentions, but for the longer-term survival of the union?\n\nIf you\u2019d asked Trigger from Only Fools and Horses to explain the application of quantum gravity to time travel, and specifically to the temporal paradoxes inherent in the Bootstrap Theory, he couldn\u2019t have looked more bamboozled.\n\nAfter recovering whatever pass for his wits, however, Barclay was very, very clear. No such forms would be needed, he explained, \u201cbecause in terms of Northern Ireland to GB, we\u2019ve said it will be frictionless\u201d.\n\nThe tweak he later offered to that may seem trivial at a time when sweating the weeny Brexit stuff is the last thing anyone needs.\n\nBut purely for the record, he amended himself to the effect that, under the Johnson surrender deal, Northern Ireland firms will have to fill out these forms. And to think that I teased David Lammy for asserting on Celebrity Mastermind that Henry VIII was succeeded by his son Henry VII, and the surname of Nobel physics laureate Marie was Antoinette.\n\nRestraint is important, as mentioned above, so let it be stated that by no means is Barclay unqualified. After a year as Brexit secretary, he is perfectly qualified to ring James O\u2019Brien on LBC and be hilariously exposed for knowing less than nothing about Brexit.\n\nBut enough about Trigger, and on to Del Boy. Would you buy a second-hand withdrawal agreement \u2013 no money back, no guarantee \u2013 from Sajid Javid?\n\nThe bumptious chancellor with the Thatcher\u2019s-child, City-boy swagger has such infectious confidence that I\u2019m baffled to find that not everyone wants a dose of him.\n\nFor me, his bouncy demeanour makes it impossible to doubt that this time next year, if we can only GET IT DONE, we\u2019ll all be millionaires. As the Saj and a fair smattering of his colleagues already are, many times over.\n\nContemplating the defining decision in modern British history, some people want to see the Treasury\u2019s economic impact assessments. It\u2019s almost as if they want some vague idea about the economic impact.\n\nThe nervous Nellies and doubting Thomases will forever be a plague. If The Saj says we needn\u2019t bother our little heads with stuff like that, because the deal is \u201cself-evidently in our economic interest\u201d, that\u2019ll do for me.\n\nSelf-evidence, after all, is a powerful force. Technically, it isn\u2019t absolutely identical to evidence. It\u2019s uncannily similar, yes, but with this one minuscule distinction. Evidence is impartial, clinical fact, often given under oath. Self-evidence is whatever someone chooses to say.\n\n\u201cI will never send a letter requesting an extension to Article 50\u201d is one example of self-evidence. Others include \u201cThe easiest trade deals EVER\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ve said it will be frictionless\u201d. \u201cThe EU27 will crack because they need us much more than we need them\u201d is yet another. I could go on. But I\u2019m being annoyingly pedantic again, so I won\u2019t.\n\nIf the Del Boy of the Treasury finds the self-evidence convincing, who wouldn\u2019t take a used Brexit deal off him in a flash without so much as a glance at the documents? Come on, you know it makes sense!\n\nI do not, cannot and will not believe that western democracy has known a cabinet anything like this one. For connoisseurs of stultifying idiocy, staggering ignorance and stupefying dishonesty, observing it is like an endless trip to Florence for a victim of Stendhal\u2019s syndrome.
