The south Florida native looked unstoppable from the start on Sunday, and tied a franchise record with five touchdown passes to help the Baltimore Ravens humiliate the Miami Dolphins and rookie coach Brian Flores, 59-10.\n\nThe Ravens set a franchise record for points in the first half, and an NFL record for points in the first half of an opener, taking a 42-10 lead at the break. They broke franchise marks for points and total yards with 643.\n\nBaltimore gained 49 yards on the first play a run by newcomer Mark Ingram and hardly slowed down after that. Jeers began when the score reached 14-0, evidence of the impending avalanche already obvious. Jackson\u2019s first nine passes, all completions, went for 204 yards and four touchdowns. That included scores of 47 and 83 yards to first-round draft pick Marquise Brown in the first 11 minutes. Jackson\u2019s performance was a big step forward for the Ravens in their transition from Joe Flacco to Jackson, who went 17 for 20 for 324 yards.\n\nKansas City Chiefs 40-26 Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nDespite losing star receiver Tyreek Hill early, Patrick Mahomes threw for 378 yards and three touchdowns while leading the Kansas City Chiefs to a testy 40-26 victory over the injury-riddled Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nMahomes took a beating and even had to leave the game to get his left ankle taped in the second quarter. He nonetheless looked every bit as good as he did during last year\u2019s MVP campaign, leading the Chiefs to scores on each of their first seven possessions. Jacksonville lost quarterback Nick Foles to a broken left clavicle.\n\nSammy Watkins caught nine passes for a career-high 198 yards and three TDs. Watkins slipped through the middle of Jacksonville\u2019s defense for a 68-yard score on the third play of the season and added a 49-yard TD reception late in the opening quarter. He made defenders Ronnie Harrison, Jalen Ramsey and Miles Jack look silly while strolling into the end zone twice. He beat Ramsey again for a short TD in the fourth period.\n\nJacksonville had major issues on both sides of the ball, fairly reminiscent of last year\u2019s 16-point loss at Arrowhead Stadium in Week 5. This one may have been more of a debacle and maybe more costly. Jaguars linebacker Jack was ejected in the second quarter after taking a swing at Chiefs receiver Demarcus Robinson. Jack had to be restrained by team officials and essentially pulled off the field.\n\nTennessee Titans 43-13 Cleveland Browns\n\nTennessee Titans (@Titans) Derrick Henry + 75 yards of green grass! \ud83d\ude03@KingHenry_2 | #TENvsCLE pic.twitter.com/kBl3I7RyAq\n\nMaybe Marcus Mariota and the Titans deserved all the hype. Tennessee\u2019s quarterback threw three touchdown passes one a stunning 75-yarder to big back Derrick Henry and the Titans rolled to a 43-13 rout over the Cleveland Browns, who fell flat on their faces in their highly anticipated opener.\n\nTitans tight end Delanie Walker had two TD catches in the fourth, and Tennessee\u2019s defensive backs intercepted Baker Mayfield three times in the fourth period.\n\nCameron Wake sacked Mayfield in the end zone for a safety in the first half, and the Titans dominated the undisciplined and perhaps overblown Browns, picked by some to contend for a Super Bowl title after adding Odell Beckham Jr. The Browns committed 18 penalties for 182 yards, a poor reflection on first-year coach Freddie Kitchens. Cleveland also had a player ejected for kicking a Titans defender. The performance left Cleveland fans and wondering if they\u2019ve been duped.\n\nBuffalo Bills 17-16 New York Jets\n\nJosh Allen threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to John Brown with three minutes left, and the Buffalo Bills rallied from a 16-point second-half deficit to stun the New York Jets 17-16.\n\nAfter struggling to get much going on offense, the Bills finally were able to move the ball after Jets middle linebacker CJ Mosley left with a groin injury. Buffalo also took advantage of kicking woes by the Jets as Kaare Vedvik, claimed last week off waivers from Minnesota, missed an extra point and a 45-yard attempt and ended up being the difference in the game.\n\nLe\u2019Veon Bell caught a touchdown pass and had a two-point conversion in his Jets debut, and Jamison Crowder had 14 catches for 99 yards in his first game with his new team but Adam Gase\u2019s offense otherwise sputtered behind a line that gave Sam Darnold little time to throw.\n\nLos Angeles Rams 30-27 Carolina Panthers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Todd Gurley walks off the field after his team\u2019s opening win of the season. Photograph: Jacob Kupferman/Getty Images\n\nJared Goff threw for 186 yards and a touchdown, Malcolm Brown ran for a pair of scores, and the defending NFC champion Los Angeles Rams spoiled Cam Newton\u2019s return with a 30-27 win over the Carolina Panthers. Todd Gurley started and ran for 97 yards on 14 carries after being limited to eight yards rushing on five carries in the first half. Brown was the primary ball carrier for the better part of three quarters and finished with 53 yards on 11 carries.\n\nChristian McCaffrey led the Panthers with 209 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns. It was a rough day for Newton, playing in his first regular-season game since Dec. 17, when a lingering shoulder injury forced him to the sideline. Newton completed 25 of 38 passes for 239 yards, but had a costly backward pass that resulted in a fumble deep in Carolina territory, and a fourth-quarter interception.\n\nWashington 27-32 Philadelphia Eagles\n\nCarson Wentz threw a pair of deep touchdown passes to DeSean Jackson, and the Philadelphia Eagles overcame a 17-point deficit to beat Washington 32-27. Wentz was 28 of 39 for 313 yards and three TDs in his first game since Week 14 after not taking a snap in the preseason. Jackson had eight catches for 154 yards. The Eagles racked up 436 total yards.\n\nCase Keenum threw for 380 yards and three TDs, helping Washington build a 17-0 lead in his first start with his fourth team in four seasons. But Philadelphia\u2019s high-powered offense took over and the defense settled down after a sloppy start.\n\nAtlanta Falcons 12-28 Minnesota Vikings\n\nAnthony Harris highlighted a thorough thrashing by Minnesota\u2019s defense with two interceptions of Matt Ryan and a fumble recovery, Dalvin Cook carried a revived running attack, and the Vikings started the season with a 28-12 victory over the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nEric Wilson recovered his own blocked punt at the Atlanta 21-yard line after a three-and-out by the Falcons on the first possession of the game, and the Vikings were well on their way to winning a fourth straight opener. Including the blocked punt, their first in five years, they turned all four Falcons turnovers into touchdowns.\n\nKirk Cousins connected with Adam Thielen for a 23-yard score to finish the short first drive and crossed the goal line on a 1-yard sneak in the second quarter to cap a 79-yard march to give Minnesota a 21-0 lead. Cousins went 8 for 10 for 98 yards, all career lows for games he started, but there was no need for more", "description": "Nine minutes into the season, Lamar Jackson had fans booing his hometown team, while the Browns looked their same old selves in their opener", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/954f8c5040525ceee0934736f973d181ce972c87/0_93_3583_2151/master/3583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7dd5536f6e54e11085a65a9bda983cc1", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
