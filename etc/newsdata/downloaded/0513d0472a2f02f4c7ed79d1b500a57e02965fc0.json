(Image: Naughty Dog)\n\nToday is not a bad day to be Tom Holland. First, we found out that his Spider-Man will continue to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And now, his other potential franchise, Uncharted, may have its next director.\n\nDeadline reports that Travis Knight, director of Bumblebee and head of Laika animation, is in \u201cnegotiations\u201d to direct the movie based on the Naughty Dog video game series about treasure hunger Nathan Drake.\n\nKnight is now the sixth (we think) director to be publicly attached to the project, after David O. Russell, Neil Burger, Seth Gordon, Shawn Levy and Dan Trachtenburg (right? Are we missing any?).\n\nAccording to the trade, if all works out, filming would begin next year \u2014 which makes that 18 December 2020 US release date currently on the books seem damn near impossible to hit. More likely, it will arrive sometime the year after.\n\nKnight is a solid, accomplished director, who proved on Bumblebee (as well as his Laika productions) he has a great eye for action, character and emotion, all of which are needed for Uncharted.\n\nOne has to wonder though, what\u2019s the problem here? Uncharted as an idea is a slam dunk. It\u2019s modern day Indiana Jones. But there must be some entity, either at Sony or Naughty Dog or somewhere, that keeps making it difficult for the film to get going.\n\nMaybe the script in its current state is too expensive to film? Maybe no one can nail that balance of big action with affordable price tag? Maybe there\u2019s a worry a bad movie would damage the game franchise? We honestly don\u2019t know.\n\nBut, like Levy and Trachtenberg and everyone else before him, Knight is another good choice here. We\u2019ll see if he\u2019s the one who finally pulls Nathan Drake off a cliff.", "description": "Today is not a bad day to be Tom Holland.
