The topic du jour on the Sunday shows is Hurricane Dorian, set to make landfall in Florida as a Category Four storm sometime tomorrow. The star guest: Pete Gaynor, acting head of FEMA, who\u2019s booked for \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d to discuss preparations. Following him on \u201cState of the Union\u201d will be Republican Sen. Rick Scott, himself an expert on hurricane management by now from his eight years as governor of Florida. Forecasters will have a better sense of where Dorian is headed by the time the interviews are recorded. Scott in particular should have insight into how bad or relatively not bad the damage is likely to be based on those projections.\n\nElsewhere this morning, acting DHS chief Kevin McAleenan will be on \u201cThis Week\u201d to chat about progress on the wall or the lack thereof. He\u2019ll be followed there by Pat Toomey, who\u2019ll relay the state of play in the Senate on his effort to expand background checks on gun purchases.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t grab you, Beto O\u2019Rourke will swing by \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and \u201cState of the Union\u201d to call Trump a racist again. And doubtless there\u2019ll be chitchat this morning about the damning IG report on James Comey\u2019s handling of Russiagate, although no guest has been scheduled yet as I write this on Saturday with that specific topic in mind. The full line-up is at the AP.", "description": "Storm.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h.jpg"}
