I tried, you know? But that's not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.\n\n'It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.'\n\nScorsese's statement lead to several Marvel Studios directors to respond to his criticism, including Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn.\n\nGunn tweeted: 'Martin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I'm saddened that he's now judging my films in the same way.'\n\nHe added: 'That said, I will always love Scorsese, be grateful for his contribution to cinema, and can't wait to see The Irishman.\n\n'And I'm not saying religious zealotry is the same as not liking my movies, or in the same category. What I'm saying is I'm not fond of people judging things without actually seeing them, whether it's a movie about Jesus or a genre.'", "description": "Natalie Portman, who will star in the upcoming Thor: Love And Thunder, defended Marvel movies after legendary director Francis Ford Coppola called them 'despicable' this week.", "authors": ["Brian Marks For Dailymail.Com", "Glenn Garner For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/03/19973490-0-image-a-35_1571623369977.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
