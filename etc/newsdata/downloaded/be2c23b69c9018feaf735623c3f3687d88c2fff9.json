Known to some as the home of The Zetter\u2019s \u201cGreat Aunt Wilhelmina,\u201d the snug boutique bolthole housed in two grand Georgian buildings also serves some truly terrific cocktails from master mixologist, Tony Conigliaro.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3221\n\nthezettertownhouse.com\n\nBest for an urban setting: The Ham Yard\n\nNeighbourhood: Soho\n\nIf you need to be in Mayfair or Soho, Ham Yard is perfectly located as its housed in an \u201curban village\u201d setting at the bottom of Regent Street. The light-filled modern building is decked out with signature Kit Kemp interiors (all neon lights and furniture are the colour of highlighter pens). Make sure you stop by the dazzling wall of 135 interconnected clocks, and the beautiful fourth-floor roof terrace, which is filled with olive trees, puffs of lavender and vegetable beds.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3662 per night\n\nfirmdalehotels.com\n\nBest for modest budgets: Hoxton Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Shoreditch\n\nEast London\u2019s first \u201cdestination\u201d hotel opened in 2006 and it\u2019s since won legions of fans for its affordable rooms in a great location. Sure, its \u201cshoebox\u201d rooms are on the small side, but they\u2019re smartly designed and you\u2019ll get a fridge stocked with snacks, a cool retro phone to use, fast wifi and access to some of Shoreditch\u2019s coolest street art sites on your doorstep. The enduringly popular Hoxton Grill also serves up pretty great American comfort food from its red leather booths.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3138\n\nthehoxton.com\n\nBest for quirky artwork: Artist Residence\n\nNeighbourhood: Pimlico\n\nOccupying a handsome five-storey regency terrace in Pimlico, this hotel\u2019s grand surroundings belie its quirky cool interiors. You\u2019ll find other Artist Residences in Brighton, Penzance and Oxfordshire, but the rakish touches to this London branch \u2013 scattered kilner vases and bedside tables made from milking stools \u2013 as well as a buzzy cocktail bar downstairs and pop art pieces scattered throughout its 10 rooms, make it a must-visit.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3225\n\nartistresidence.co.uk\n\nBest for the fashion crowd: The Mandrake\n\nNeighbourhood: Fitzrovia\n\nRemodelled from a Riba-winning building in swanky Fitzrovia, the Mandrake is inspired by its medicinal botanical namesake. When it opened its doors in 2017, the luxury spot (which pays homage to \u201chealing and positive energies\u201d) was an instant hit with the capital\u2019s fashion crowd, who flocked to its moody dark corridors and Instagrammable, foliage-filled inner courtyard. Its 30 texture-filled rooms, set over four floors are some of London\u2019s sultriest.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3272\n\nthemandrake.com\n\nBest for pared-back chic: Boundary Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Shoreditch\n\nUnsurprisingly, rooms at Terence Conran\u2019s design hotel The Boundary Project are easy on the eye. Each comes with a handmade bed, clean-lined furniture from Eames, Mies Van de Rohe and Le Courbusier, and original artwork on the walls. You could do worse than to spend an evening on the rooftop bar and grill (with views across London\u2019s East End skyline), and there\u2019s always Redchurch Street round the corner, if you\u2019re in need of some retail therapy.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3145\n\nboundary.london\n\nBest for theatre-lovers: Henrietta Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Covent Garden\n\nWant to be in the thick of it but don\u2019t want to compromise on style? The Henrietta \u2013 the first London outpost from the Paris-based Experimental Group \u2013 gives great access to London\u2019s bustling West End, without feeling like a tourist trap. Rooms are a zingy mix of leopard print wallpaper, marble skirting boards and geometric floors, and there\u2019s also an 80-seat restaurant on site for a thoroughly decent pre-theatre dinner.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3236\n\nhenriettahotel.com\n\nBest for history buffs: Great Northern Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: King\u2019s Cross\n\nLondon\u2019s first railway hotel has just got a multi-million-pound refurbish. Dating back to 1854, the charming Great Northern Hotel now stands proud between the Eurostar\u2019s St Pancras terminal and King\u2019s Cross. Mini rooms modelled on sleeper carriages sit alongside pantries filled with tea, coffee and cakes (it\u2019s more \u201chelp yourself\u201d than \u201croom service\u201d here), but the main draw is the extra hours\u2019 sleep you\u2019ll get being so close to the train platform \u2013 we calculate it as a breezy three-minute dash.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3188\n\ngnhlondon.com\n\nBest for a buzzy neighbourhood: Ace Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Shoreditch\n\nThe Ace Hotel has achieved a rare thing \u2013 as well as its jazzily designed restaurant Hoi Polloi on the ground floor, the UK branch of the American indie chain also has a basement club that is genuinely cool \u2013 there are no city suits in sight here. Rooms are reasonably priced too and filled with dark wood floors, concrete walls and fun amenities such as record players and acoustic guitars. There are even co-working spaces, an entrance lobby crammed to the rafters with flowers and a sauna on site.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3151 per night\n\nacehotel.com/london\n\nBest for museum visits: Number Sixteen\n\nNeighbourhood: South Kensington\n\nNumber Sixteen is actually a row of four early 19th-century townhouses, just two blocks from South Kensington tube station \u2013 putting you within striking distance of some of London\u2019s most incredible museums and galleries. The entrance is discreet (you may need a helping hand to find it), but once inside you\u2019ll find a smattering of classic Kit Kemp touches, from the beautiful driftwood chandelier in the drawing room, to the striking quality street purple and sunflower yellow pops in the library. Rooms are classy-cool and there\u2019s also a tree-filled private garden for soporific al fresco cocktails.\n\nDoubles from \u00a327\n\nfirmdalehotels.com\n\nBest for a proper London view: Hotel Cafe Royal\n\nNeighbourhood: Piccadilly Circus\n\nFew hotels have as \u201cLondon\u201d a location as Hotel Cafe Royal, in a discreet location in a very indiscreet place: Piccadilly Circus. This gorgeous heritage property has retained its historic features (check out the old-school lifts) as well as some seriously starry guests that have included David Bowie and Sir Winston Churchill.\n\nThe suite to ask for is 202 (the Regent suite), a vast space with three (three!) balconies overlooking the flashing billboards of London\u2019s most OTT public space, which make the most wonderful, surreal place to enjoy a drink before shuffling downstairs to sushi and grill restaurant Laurent Cafe Royal. The hotel has just launched three-Michelin-star chef Albert Adri\u00e0\u2019s Cake & Bubbles concept, where you sip champagne alongside posh desserts, naturally.\n\nRooms from \u00a3440\n\nhotelcaferoyal.com\n\nBest for a sexy vibe: Blakes Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Chelsea\n\nAt the end of a gorgeous residential street in Chelsea is matte-black Blakes, one of London's most coy hotels. Designed by interiors superstar Anoushka Hempel, this five-star boutique toes a cosy line between discreet, sexy and outrageously eclectic: each of the rooms and suites are individually designed (the Biedermeier suite, above, is all black wood, antique furniture and mountains of satin cushions), many with four-poster beds and thick, billowing drapes. Things get racier still in the dim-lit, mirrored Blakes Restaurant downstairs, which at the weekend becomes a Chelsea institution serving decadent plates of burrata, grass-fed rib-eye steak and lobster pasta. The subterranean Blakes Below members' club, also designed by Hempel, is where things ramp up a notch on weekend evenings with a DJ and beautiful crowd.\n\nFrom \u00a3340 a night\n\nblakeshotels.com\n\nBest for business travellers: Vintry & Mercer\n\nNeighbourhood: The City\n\nVintry & Mercer is part of a growing band of contemporary leisure hotels in London's businessy heart. The sister property to Kensington's Ampersand Hotel is buried amid the narrow streets just behind Mansion House station, home to the City of London's historic livery halls. It's from this plum location that Vintry & Mercer takes its name and inspiration: Vintry for the wine heritage, Mercer for fabrics.\n\nDespite its historic location, this 92-room property makes a seriously modern statement: there are plants sprouting from the lobby, bulb lamps and cosy leather armchairs tucked into every corner. Rooms are compact but jauntily decorated, with each design detail reflecting the hotel's heritage: there's bespoke fabrics in popping jewel tones, palm leaf wallpaper and antiquated maps of the area (plus a free minibar and upscale C.O. Bigelow toiletries in the bathroom). The Mercer Roof Terrace provides spellbinding views of a City sunset alongside its farm-to-table steaks and fish; while sexy-cosy downstairs speakeasy DND wows with its jewelled photographs and playful barrel-aged cocktails. Inside tip: the Martina, made with rum, lemon juice and soy sauce, is named after the owner's girlfriend and a solid-gold bet.\n\nRooms from \u00a3175\n\nvintryandmercer.com\n\nBest for film buffs: Victory House\n\nNeighbourhood: Leicester Square\n\nSandwiched between the Prince Charles Cinema and Leicester Square is Victory House, an 86-room boutique overlooking the Odeon cinema. The hotel, housed in a late-19th century building that was once L'H\u00f4tel de l\u2019Europe, is very much inspired by the area: silent films are projected onto the deep purple walls, while cinematic black-and-white photos everywhere give it a whiff of Parisian glamour. The rooms and suites aren't deluxe in size, but rather thoughtfully designed with gold lamps and hooks; some suites on the sixth floor, the highest in the hotel, come with characterful round portholes and drooping eaves.\n\nOverlooking Leicester Square might not be everyone's idea of a good night's sleep, but there's an answer for that too. Everything inside the rooms and suites at Victory House is included in the rate, including a set of earplugs.\n\nRooms from \u00a3158\n\nvictoryhouselondon.com\n\nNeighbourhood: South Kensington\n\nHotel and embassy-strung Queen's Gate runs between groomed Kensington Gardens and South Kensington, meaning some of London's best museums and galleries are almost on the doorstep (the V&A and the Natural History Museum to name just two). Technically part of Hilton's Curio Collection, this boutique-in-vibe property is housed across grand townhouses that were the former home of aristocrat William Alexander.\n\nThe rooms and neat and plush, with velvet soft furnishings, fun additions like old-style telephones and cosy fireplaces. Downstairs, suntrap atrium Botanica serves an Instagrammable afternoon tea of traditional sandwiches and scones; while in-res restaurant WA (named after the building's former proprietor) serves a menu of French fusion dishes. The hotel's various artefacts \u2013 tweezers in a glass cabinet, a portrait of Virginia Woolf \u2013 add to the ever-so-slightly cerebral feel.\n\nRooms from \u00a3184\n\n100queensgate.com", "description": "The best boutique hotels in London, from arty residences to former station buildings, chosen by our resident expert.", "authors": ["Cathy Adams", "Lizzie Pook"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/04/16/london.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-01"}
