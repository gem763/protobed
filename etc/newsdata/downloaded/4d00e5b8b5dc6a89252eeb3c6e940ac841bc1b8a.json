Babies who suffer with the most severe form of the condition, known as SMA type one, have a life expectancy of up to two years.\n\nOn the TeamPia website, which was set up to raise awareness of the disorder and to campaign for funds, the family posted a message highlighting Pia's need for the new \"miracle\" treatment.\n\n\"A wondrous medicine was invented, called Zolgensma. It is a gene-therapy, administered in one shot, that will put the [missing gene] into my DNA,\" the post reads.\n\n\"The first results of this medicine are very promising. I could lead a long, beautiful life, in which I might even learn to walk, or at least be more independent.\"\n\nPia was born on 27 November and was diagnosed with SMA type one in May.\n\nWhy is the drug so expensive?\n\nThe treatment, which involves a single course of Zolgensma being administered by injection, has been successful in trials on more than a dozen infants in the US.\n\nHowever, the high cost has been criticised and an application for the drug's approval by the European Medicines Authority (EMA) is still pending.\n\nHealth Minister Maggie De Block said that while the drug was extremely expensive, negotiations over the cost would not take place until it had received European approval.\n\nNovartis, the Swiss-based pharmaceutical company that produces the drug, said the cost of the treatment was high because it was \"a one-off, transformative therapy for an extremely rare disease\".\n\n\"We are aware of Pia and the efforts to facilitate her access to treatment,\" Novartis said in a statement on Tuesday, adding: \"We also recognize that patients and families around the world are interested in gaining access to treatment as quickly as possible.\"\n\nYou might also be interested in:", "description": "Phone donations are made in Belgium to help treat nine-month-old Pia's rare condition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5F19/production/_108854342_innekegebruers-familieshoot-wilrijk-dayinthelife-ellen-tim-briek-pia-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
