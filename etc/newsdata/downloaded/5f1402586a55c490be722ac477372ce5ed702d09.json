KCNA via REUTERS\n\nIn a statement under the name of Chairman of the Korea-Asia Pacific Peace Committee Kim Yong Chol, KCNA said that it would be mistaken for the United States to ignore a year-end deadline on U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s \u201cclose personal relations.\u201d\n\nKim Jong Un has set an end-of-the-year deadline for denuclearisation talks with Washington.\n\nKim Yong Chol was the nuclear talks envoy to the United States for the discussions between the two countries before the second summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un in Vietnam in February ended in failure.\n\nKim Yong Chol said the United States has been pressuring North Korea in a \u201cmore crafty and vicious way\u201d instead of heeding North Korea\u2019s call for Washington to adopt a new approach, adding that the United States has been persistently pushing other countries to impose U.N. sanctions on North Korea.\n\nThe statement quoted Kim Yong Chol as saying he hopes that U.S.-North Korean relations do not underscore that \u201cthere are permanent foes but no permanent friends.\u201d\n\nThe statement comes just days after North Korea asked South Korea to discuss removal of its facilities from the North\u2019s resort of Mount Kumgang, a key symbol of cooperation that Pyongyang recently criticised as \u201cshabby\u201d and \u201ccapitalist.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea on Friday sent notices to the South\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles issues between the two sides, and Hyundai Group, whose affiliate Hyundai Asan Corp built the resort facilities, asking for their demolition and seeking discussion through the exchange of documents, the ministry said.\n\nState media also reported on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected the Myohyangsan Medical Appliances Factory, which is under reconstruction. Kim paid a visit to the factory last August as part of move to encourage economic development.\n\nKim, who had strongly condemned the lack of visible modernisation last time, said during this visit that \u201cthe factory was given a complete facelift and its look changed fundamentally.\u201d\n\nHe criticised, however, \u201cthe insufficient quality of the construction that comes short of the needs of design and engineering,\u201d KCNA said, adding that he promised to send a highly skilled construction unit soon to fix the problems and complete the factory flawlessly by the end of the year.", "description": "North Korea said on Sunday there has been no progress in the North Korea-United States relations, and hostilities that could lead to an exchange of fire have continued, according to North Korea's state news agency KCNA.", "authors": ["Heekyong Yang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445367842&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q02X", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
