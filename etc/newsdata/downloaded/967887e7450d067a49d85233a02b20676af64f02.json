She\u2019s struggling to cope as a result of the immense pressure she\u2019s been under and tonight\u2019s episode will see the young woman attempt to take her own life.\n\nUnable to listen Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) going on about Uni, viewers saw Bex take advantange of a distraction earlier this week when she helped plan Louise\u2019s (Tilly Keeper) baby shower. However, the event did little to cheer her up \u2014 and Lisa (Lucy Benjamin) began to worry about her. With Sonia pushing her to prepare for Uni, Bex ultimately sold her guitar, and reminisced about both Shaki (Shaheen Jafargholi) and her time in Walford.\n\nTonight, Sonia prepares for Bex\u2019s final day in Walford, and she gets everything in order for the surprise party she\u2019s arranged. When Bex gets wind of the party, she reluctantly agrees to go and, during the celebrations, she feigns enjoyment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLisa picks up on the fact that Bex isn\u2019t okay and thus attempts to persuade her to open up to her mum. However, Bex brushes Lisa off and makes a speech, before sneaking off.\n\nWith the stress of everything that she\u2019s had to deal with over the past few months \u2014 not to mention the thought of leaving Walford weighing on her mind \u2014 Bex finds herself unable to cope, and \u2014unbeknown to those enjoying themselves at the party \u2014 she\u2019s planning to take her own life.\n\nThe following day, Lisa\u2019s concerns about Bex continue to weigh on her mind and, as a result, she urges Louise to call her. Meanwhile, a shocked Sonia discovers Bex unresponsive in bed.\n\nEastEnders is working with Samaritans on the storyline, and Executive Producer Jon Sen told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We wanted to take Bex on a journey which accurately reflected the crises facing many young people today \u2013 many of whom, like Bex, struggle under the mounting pressures placed on teenagers today. Having worked closely with Samaritans, our wish is that by telling this story we can encourage others in Bex\u2019s position to realise there\u2019s always help and there\u2019s always hope and we hope that others will be encouraged to start a conversation if they are worried about someone they know.\u2019\n\nEastEnders continues on Thursday 3rd October at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nNeed support?
