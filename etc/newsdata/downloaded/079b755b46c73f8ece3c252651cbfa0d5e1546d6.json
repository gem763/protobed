President Donald Trump authorized the release of oil from the U.S. emergency oil reserves. Gold rose about 1%, while S&P 500 futures fell as much as 0.7%. The Norwegian krone and Canadian dollar, both from energy-producing nations, were the best performers among Group-of-10 currencies.\n\nRead about oil jumping the most ever after an attack cuts Saudi supplies.\n\nWhile the attack roiled energy markets, multi-asset investors should look at the bigger picture as there might be opportunities to take advantage, strategists said.\n\nAny initial selling in equities \u201cis likely a buy,\u201d said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Pte in Singapore. \u201cGenerally speaking there is a positive correlation over time between oil and U.S. equities. Energy is still likely to stay bid if there is some kind of response from Saudi Arabia and allies. It\u2019s worth noting that the situation is also very dynamic and no doubt they are working 24-7 to repair the damage.\u201d\n\nThe incident adds to an already busy week for markets, with policy decisions from the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and more as well as Brexit discussions and the open of the United Nations General Assembly regular session.\n\n\u201cThis could create a little churn here ahead of the Fed,\u201c said Tony Dwyer, equity strategist at Canaccord Genuity LLC in New York. \u201cClearly oil is breaking out, but if there were a true fear there it seems like the equity futures would be down more than one-third of a percent.\u201d\n\nStephen Innes, Asia-Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader, agreed.\n\n\u201cInvestors will turn to bargain-hunting as trade-war winds blow fair and of course with the prospects of Fed easing and all the other central banks leaning dovish,\u201d he said.\n\nA Possible \u2018One-Off\u2019\n\nBrian Barish, chief investment officer at Cambiar Investors LLC in Denver, recommended remaining calm.\n\n\u201cBased on what I know, this is a short-term one-off event; I certainly would not run out and make any major decisions based on this,\u201d Barish said. \u201cThe energy market remains generally oversupplied so it\u2019s short-term relief but I don\u2019t see this changing the larger picture.\u201d\n\nThere might be opportunities in the currency market, with energy-producing nations faring better and importers having a worse time.\n\n\u201cWe should see buying in the Russian ruble as the day rolls on,\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group Ltd. in Melbourne. \u201cThis is obviously not a good day if you are an oil importer.\u201d\n\nThe traditional havens such as gold may present opportunity as well.\n\n\u201cGold may have just gotten a key catalyst that will allow it to resume its bullish march toward $1,600 an ounce,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp.", "description": "Oil Jolt May Have Short-Term Impact for Markets Elsewhere", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice6465483ee4cb57c2a5d230b764a6ec6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
