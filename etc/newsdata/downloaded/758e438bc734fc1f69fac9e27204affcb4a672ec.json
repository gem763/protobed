Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nControversy initially ensued when President Donald Trump came to speak during a visit to the historically black college where he gave a keynote speech before accepting a Bipartisan Justice Award for his work on criminal justice forum.\n\nCampus was on lockdown for his appearance; protocol directed by secret service and White House, according to Benedict administrative officials. Students were required to remain where they were once the president arrived on campus, and just a small select handful of honor students were permitted inside the forum. Everybody else had to remain in their dorm rooms or watch the forum remotely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not upset about [Trump] coming on campus, I\u2019m upset about not being able to come and attend the event,\u201d said Luis de La Mora, a 19-year-old sophomore at Benedict. He told ABC News that he was disappointed that weren\u2019t more accommodations made for the students.\n\n\u201cOnly the most exclusive kind of people are allowed to go in,\u201d de la Mora said. \u201cFor me it feels a little exploitative to say this is such a progressive move, since this is the first time Trump would be visiting an HBCU, at least our little HBCU. It\u2019s supposed to be a shining moment when the world is paying attention to our little institution, but our students don\u2019t really get to do anything about it.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, Mayor Benjamin told reporters he was concerned about the low amount of students who were able to attend the forum.\n\n\u201c I think every time you have the opportunity to expose more young people to public service, to politics, to new ideas, I think we need to avail ourselves to them,\u201d Benjamin said.\u201d I wish more had the opportunity to participate today.\u201d\n\nMeg Kinnard/AP Images\n\nOn Saturday, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-CA, announced that she would no longer be attending the forum. She withdrew late Friday citing a lack of access for students and voiced frustration that the Bipartisan Justice Center would celebrate the president, who has recently doubled down on his long-time comments calling for the execution of black teenagers known as the Central Park 5. Moreover, the award to Trump was the same award given to Harris in 2016.\n\nAs friction grew over Trump\u2019s honor as well as his presence on campus, it was announced that the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice group would step aside from their sponsorship of the forum.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Columbia\u2019s mayor, Steve Benjamin, said that Benedict College had taken \u201cfull operational control\u201d of the candidate forum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to work earnestly and in the long term interests of Benedict College,\u201d Benjamin said.\n\nThen -- amid the ongoing forum -- Harris, an HBCU graduate herself, announced that she would now be re-attending the event due to the fact that the sponsor was \u201cremoved.\u201d\n\nAfter she agreed to rejoin, she thanked Mayor Benjamin in her speech for his leadership and his rebranding of the forum.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just deal with the elephant in the room which is the events of the last 24-48 hours,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMayor Benjamin called me and told me that it was shifting and it was going to change ... that it was only right and a reflection of this most honorable institution that it would be opened to students, this event, that it would not be a paid event and that everyone would be able to participate,\u201d Harris said.\n\nBut the Bipartisan Justice group\u2019s representatives -- and their social media presence worldwide -- were still saying they were sponsoring the forum which fueled much confusion and speculation that 20/20 had not dropped out completely.\n\nPer Mayor Benjamin\u2019s aides, this was \"because of contracts, [and] some infrastructure had to stay in place. However \u2026 Benedict college are now running the event. The candidate forum portion of event is rebranded, 20/20 is not hosting that. They are still leading a few panels and working to accommodate the folks that bought passes from them.\"\n\nMichael Holahan/The Augusta Chronicle via AP\n\nMembers of the Bipartisan Justice Center\u2019s board of directors also echoed this saying the organization is still co-hosting the event. On its face, sources tell ABC News that Benedict College will not be taking the lead on the candidate forums. This means, the events are open to students and members of the community and that forums will be taking questions at the discretion of the campaigns.\n\nOther candidates at the forum weighed on Harris\u2019 moving position.\n\n\u201cKamala is more than a colleague, she\u2019s a sister to me, and I'll let her speak for herself about her decision she made,\u201d Sen. Cory Booker, addressing reporters. \u201c[Trump\u2019s] remarks were then offensive. Talking about being the best president ever for black people, which is just not only an offensive lie, because he\u2019s actually doing things to hurt the African American community. So, I just felt that it was very important for me to be here to support a great institution.\u201d\n\nABC's Armando Garcia, Zohreen Shah, Adam Kelsey, John Verhovek, Justin Gomez contributed to this report", "description": "Trump came to SC HBCU for an award, and Kamala Harris threatened to refuse to come because of it.
