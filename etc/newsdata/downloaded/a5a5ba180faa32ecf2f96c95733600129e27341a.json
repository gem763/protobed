He said that times have found us,\u201d she stated, declaring that Democrats see themselves in a similar position.\n\n\u201cThe times have found us,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cWe think the times have found us now\u2013 you, Mr. Chairman, everyone in this room who sacrificed their time, resources, and the rest. No need to be here but to be there for our candidates so that we can make a better future,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cNone of us came to Congress to impeach a president. Not anybody, not anybody. That\u2019s not what we are about,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut we did take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies foreign and domestic\u201d:\n\nPelosi\u2019s claim that none of the Democrat lawmakers came to Congress with the intention of pursuing impeachment against the president is patently false. Some members of the far-left \u201cSquad\u201d called for President Trump\u2019s impeachment prior to taking office. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), for instance, appeared on Real America with Jorge Ramos last fall \u2013 prior to taking office \u2013 and called impeachment a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, yeah. To me, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told Ramos.\n\nShe continued:\n\nWell, I believe that he has violated the law. Violated potentially many laws, whether it\u2019s the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because he keeps his businesses open that foreign actors kind of participate in financial transactions with. \u2026 Whether it\u2019s what we are seeing with potentially illegal buyouts of campaign, you know, FEC violations of women that he is trying to silence.\n\nSimilarly, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) had impeachment on her mind going into office, declaring on her first day that they were going to \u201cimpeach the motherfucker\u201d:", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Thursday compared the Democrat-led impeachment effort to the American Revolution.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Nancy-Pelosi-hand-up-podium-DNC-Womens-Leadership-Forum-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
