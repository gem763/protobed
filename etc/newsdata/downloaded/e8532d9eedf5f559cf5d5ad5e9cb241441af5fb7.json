Relaxed Fit Crewneck Sweatshirt\n\nSometimes, even the most subtle embellishment or logo makes a garment less versatile. Thankfully, there are plenty of simple, unadorned crewneck sweatshirts out there, like this A.P.C. number, which was recommended by Omar Sosa, co-founder and creative director of Apartamento magazine. \u201cI\u2019m very specific with how big the neck is, and if the neck is too loose or if it\u2019s too tight and becomes uncomfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cI have an A.P.C. one that I like a lot that shows just the right amount of neck.\u201d Sosa says that his favorite A.P.C. sweatshirt is very heavy and has a very warm fleece lining. \u201cWhat I like about the A.P.C. is that it really hugs you,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s what I wear if I\u2019m going to be on a plane for more than three hours.\u201d The sweatshirt hits the sweet spot between comfy and presentable, too. \u201cIt\u2019s super cozy and it\u2019s the only one that my wife says doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m going to the gym,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s great for when you want to be comfortable and don\u2019t have to think about what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d", "description": "We asked stylish men about their favorite crewneck sweatshirts, and heard about fleece, cotton, and terry options from J.Crew, Champion, Todd Snyder, Saturdays NYC, A.P.C., Alternative Apparel, and more.", "authors": ["Barret Wertz", "Hilary Reid"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2018/04/19/mens-sweatshirts/19-mens-sweatshirts-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
