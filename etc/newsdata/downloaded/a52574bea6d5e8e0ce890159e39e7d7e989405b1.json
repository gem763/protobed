Scorpio season is upon us, and that means natives of this sign, like world-famous momager, Kris Jenner, and her model-daughter, Kendall, will be at their most powerful from Oct. 23rd through Nov. 22nd. People with this sign are masters at getting others to do their bidding, and Kris is definitely proof enough of that.\n\nScorpios Kris Jenner and Kendall Jenner at Paris Fashion Week More\n\nShe and Kendall are in good Scorpio company, too, with celebs such as Katy Perry, Drake and Leonardo DiCaprio sharing the same sun sign.\n\nScorpio is one of the water signs, which tend to be emotional, and it\u2019s a fixed sign at that, meaning that there can be stubborn, opinionated and rigid, single-minded qualities to the personality. Put them both together and you have someone who is extremely attached to the people, places and things they are emotionally dependent upon.\n\nFailure, to a Scorpio, is about as emotionally devastating as poor TV ratings are to Donald Trump. That\u2019s because what truly makes or breaks a Scorpio is how they feel about themselves, especially in comparison to others. Scorpio is ruled by the planet Mars, which gives us the passion and willpower needed to attain our goals. Mix that with a water sign, and you\u2019ve got someone who will stop at nothing to get what they want.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times Magazine about her rise to success, Kris Jenner said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that have great ideas and dreams and whatnot, but unless you\u2019re willing to work really, really hard, and work for what you want, it\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d Solid advice from a true Scorpio queen.\n\nIt may be no surprise to learn that when it comes to romance, Scorpios make pretty intense lovers. Since Scorpio\u2019s emotions tend to revolve around themselves, this sign is no stranger to some of the \u201cdarker\u201d emotions associated with love, such as jealousy and envy. However, if a Scorpio learns how to control their emotions rather than visa versa, they can manifest an inner empowerment that makes them impervious to criticism. Not a bad quality to have for reality stars like the Jenners.\n\nOn the flip side, when a Scorpio can keep their emotions in check, they are passionate and loyal partners who would pretty much lay down their lives for the one they love. Being possessive in love, Scorpios would prefer to keep their lover all to themselves, and aren\u2019t the type to post their boo all over social media. Take Kendall, for instance: She is absurdly famous, yet her love life is, and always has been, shrouded in mystery.\n\nIf you find yourself getting carried away by intense emotions this Scorpio season, take a page out of Kris\u2019 book and channel them into the willpower to get work done like a boss. If you\u2019re having trouble doing this, a fierce cat-eye, red lip, fresh cut or a well-tailored suit can really help you get into that \u201cScorpionic\u201d mindset. You\u2019ll be running your own empire like Scorpio Queen Kris in no time.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Kris share the zodiac sign, Scorpio, and Scorpio season is upon us.
