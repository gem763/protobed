Taking great pictures from the cabin, after all, is no easy feat.\n\nGood news has landed, however, for those who are perpetually disappointed with their shots from the air \u2013 top tips on aircraft window photography from high-flying aerial snapper Jason Hawkes.\n\nJason took this picture of The Shard during his reconnaissance mission from London City Airport to Edinburgh and back\n\nHere's Mr Hawkes' snap of the O2 Arena, which he took from the cabin of an Embraer 190 aircraft\n\nCapital stuff: A stunning view of London, showing City Airport in the foreground and the Thames snaking past the O2 Arena and Canary Wharf\n\nMr Hawkes usually specialises in photography from helicopters, so to become acquainted with the problems associated with shooting from a jet aircraft he went on a reconnaissance mission from London City Airport to Edinburgh, courtesy of British Airways, which is sympathetic with amateur photographers who see their pictures spoilt by, say, an aircraft wing or glare from the sun.\n\nJason, who usually specialises in photography from helicopters rather than jet aircraft, chose his seat carefully to ensure the perfect view from the Embraer 190 aircraft.\n\nWith two-abreast seating, so a choice of window and aisle seats on both sides of the aircraft, all he needed to consider was what part of the cabin to sit in.\n\nA view of the area just to the east of City Airport, with the Barking Creek Barrier guarding the entrance to River Roding\n\nHe chose window seats in row three in the front of the cabin to capture the perfect take-off shot over Canary Wharf and the approach over the North Sea into Edinburgh.\n\nThe result was a collection of picture-perfect demo images of some of the most iconic landmarks of the two capital cities.\n\nThey included the famous dome of the O2 Arena and the 95-storey Shard in London, plus the extinct Arthur\u2019s Seat volcano, the commercial Calton Hill district and the Scottish Parliament buildings in Edinburgh.\n\nJason said: \u2018I've spent the past 25 years of my working life hanging out of the sides of helicopters shooting aerial views all over the world.' This image is another that the photographer took on his trip to Scotland\n\nArthur\u2019s Seat volcano, snapped by Jason from his Embraer window seat\n\nHello, Scotland: On a clear day, the views from planes taking off from, and arriving at, Edinburgh Airport are stunning. Here Jason shows his prowess once more\n\nJason said: \u2018I've spent the past 25 years of my working life hanging out of the sides of helicopters shooting aerial views all over the world. In a helicopter your first thoughts are safety, both for yourself and the pilot, and of course also for those below you on the ground.\n\n\u2018It was a very different experience altogether shooting from a British Airways aircraft, certainly the first time I\u2019ve been offered such good coffee whilst I\u2019ve been working! In the helicopter the doors are either taken right off or open, but in a standard aircraft the first thing you\u2019ll have to deal with are reflections and glare from the window.\n\nSo here are my top tips:\n\nI always try and shoot in one of the 'golden hours', either the hour just after sunrise or the hour just before sunset, to get lovely warm light and long shadows to accentuate both the urban and natural forms of the landscape.\n\nIf you are shooting images on take-off and landing, and have various lenses, I found anything between a 24mm and 70mm works best.\n\nIf you can, set your camera or phone camera onto a shutter speed of 1/1000th of a second or higher. This will ensure you get sharp images even if the aircraft is vibrating.\n\nIf you have a DSLR you could also try using a polariser filter. A circular polariser filter only allows light rays that are traveling in one direction to enter the lens. It\u2019s a great tool but is a little tricky to use if the aircraft is banking round, as you have to turn the filter to get the desired effect.\n\nYou could also try a lens skirt or large rubber lens hood, which are both great for blocking out window glare.\n\nJason said that reflections and glare from the window are two of the biggest problems when shooting from a plane. This image shows a wind farm in the North Sea\n\nThis is a really technical tip but one I would give in whatever situation you are working - set your camera to shoot in both Raw and jpeg. You\u2019ll have to grade the Raw file yourself to get the most out of it, but it\u2019s really worth the effort and gives you a huge amount of control over the final image that you could never get from a jpeg. The standard iOS camera app for iPhone doesn\u2019t support capturing Raw photos, so you\u2019ll need to download a third-party app, such as Adobe Lightroom CC.\n\nOn this aircraft type row three worked best for me. I chose to sit in 3A for the outbound leg from City Airport and 3D for the return. Try and ensure you sit towards the front or the back of the aircraft to get an unobstructed view.\n\nTo try and shoot without reflections the most basic tip of all is to ensure your lens is as close to the window as possible without actually touching it.\n\nBritish Airways operates up to 10 return flights a day between London City and Edinburgh.", "description": "Jason Hawkes usually works from a helicopter, so he went on a recce mission from London City Airport to Edinburgh, with BA, to acquaint himself with the issues of shooting from a cabin.", "authors": ["Ted Thornhill", "Mailonline Travel Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19993706-0-image-a-143_1571667006549.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
