REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nCorbyn is holding his party\u2019s annual conference in the English coastal resort of Brighton, seeking to showcase Labour\u2019s leftist policies and present himself as the only person who can resolve the impasse over Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union.\n\nBut the opening days of the conference have been overshadowed by internal splits - including over Brexit - that have raised questions over the strength of Corbyn\u2019s position.\n\nThe YouGov poll showed 54% of those who backed Labour in 2017 think Corbyn should resign and be replaced with someone else, with 29% saying he should stay and 17% saying they did not know.\n\nYouGov surveyed 1,650 adults on Sept. 18 and 19, before the conference began.\n\nAmong the wider electorate, the percentage who thought Corbyn should go was 58%, while that stood at 34% among those who said they were current Labour supporters.\n\nThe veteran Labour leader, who took control of the party in 2015, comfortably survived an attempt to oust him in 2016 thanks in part to a huge influx of grassroots members who backed his shift towards a more radical left-wing agenda.\n\nCorbyn said on Sunday he intended to lead the party into the next general election, which is not scheduled until 2022, but is expected to be held later this year as Britain tries to resolve the deadlock over how or whether to leave the European Union.\n\nConservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson is promising Britain will leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without an exit deal, but opponents believe they have passed a law forbidding him to do so. The outcome of that impasse is uncertain.\n\nThe situation has put Corbyn\u2019s own Brexit policy under intense scrutiny.\n\nHe wants to request more negotiating time, win an election, negotiate a new deal and then put it to the public in a referendum which also offers voters the chance to remain in the EU. Corbyn has not said what he would campaign for in that referendum.\n\nThe YouGov survey showed that 69% of the general population found this policy unclear or confusing. Among those who identified themselves as voting to stay inside the EU in 2016, 46% opposed his Brexit policy.", "description": "More than half of voters who backed Britain's opposition Labour Party at a 2017 election think it is now time for leader Jeremy Corbyn to stand down, an opinion poll showed on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432754823&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0VW", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
