Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) demanded the secretary step down in statements late Monday, saying Ross\u2019s reported threats were \u201can embarrassing new low.\u201d\n\n\u201cWilbur Ross does not deserve the trust of the American people or a place in the Cabinet and he should be dismissed immediately,\u201d Beyer wrote.\n\n\u201cReporting now suggests that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross put the safety of countless Americans at risk by compromising America\u2019s hurricane warning system just to protect the President\u2019s ego. If these reports are true, Secretary Ross needs to take responsibility and resign,\u201d Tonko wrote.", "description": "", "authors": ["The Hill", "Thehill.Com Homenews Administration"], "top_image": ""}
