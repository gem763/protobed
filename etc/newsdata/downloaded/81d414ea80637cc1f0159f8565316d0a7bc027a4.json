Notably, a lot of damage that is done to the environment due to rapid construction and urbanisation can be prevented if eco-friendly techniques and raw materials are used. The group will also lay emphasis on how to get rid of the waste, and aims to spread awareness among labourers.\n\nE-waste is another key area of their focus and they aim to spread awareness among people through social media and other online campaigns. They will also be running e-waste collection drive through key locations in the city.", "description": "The group, which is formed out of the coming together of women from India, aims to launch a series of initiatives in the capital of the UAE, Abu Dhabi.
