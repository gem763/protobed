Feel free to give me a call.'\n\nSharing it with his 880,000 followers he said: 'Institutional racism for you.\n\n'Let's get the token black on to talk about racism, but let's not call him to talk about a sport he played for 20 years.\n\n'No thanks @GMB, my race isn't a 2 min bit before you give someone from Geordie Shore an hour to show you their new nails.'\n\nBut his response prompted a debate among fans, with some backing him and others urging him to use his platform to discuss the racist abuse.\n\nPiers later hit back, tweeting: 'Sorry? We're racist for asking you to comment about racism at a football match, an issue you've spoken about so many times?\n\n'Get a grip, Stan \u2013 you sound absurd.'\n\nA fan holds up a No Respect jumper, a reference to UEFA's Respect campaign which encourages equality in football\n\nFans in black wore clothes which had 'ultras' and 'hooligans' printed on them, before a mass walk-out before half-time\n\nHordes of Bulgarian fans in black hoodies and shirts which said 'hooligans from Sofia' left the stadium after warnings over their behaviour\n\nCollymore took to Twitter to post the email from GMB producers, inviting him on the show\n\nThe pair came to blows in May 2017, when the former striker took Piers to task over his 'man up' comments on mental illness.\n\nPiers had caused a stir on social media after he tweeted: 'I'm not convinced by this new trend of male public soul-bearing. Time for our gender to get a grip, methinks. Life's tough-man up.'\n\nCollymore had opened up about his battle with depression, and revealed he was told by a manger during his time at Aston Villa in 1999 that fans wouldn't sympathise with his illness.\n\nCollymore said at the time: 'The man up comments from Piers the other day\u2026 If I was on the football pitch and I had a compound fracture in my bone, you wouldn't be able to man up and run it off. It's exactly the same approach.'\n\nBut Piers said he 'didn't like the way having a stiff upper lip has been offensive.'", "description": "The former England footballer was asked to appear on the ITV show today in the wake of last night's match which saw far-right Bulgarian fans perform Nazi salutes and hurl racist abuse.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19733148-0-image-a-25_1571131976106.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
