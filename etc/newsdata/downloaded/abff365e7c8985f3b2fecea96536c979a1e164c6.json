Most have supported President Trump; a few have not. Some of the president\u2019s supporters have been enthusiastic; many have not. Some of the reluctant Trump supporters have expressed reservations at certain times; many have not.\n\nBut with the revelations of the last week, and the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry, we are at a new moment. This is obviously the case for Republicans in Congress, who will have to vote on impeachment and perhaps on conviction. They have a unique part to play in this drama; the rest of us are merely observers or advisers. All we can really now ask of members of Congress is to keep an open mind and to evaluate the facts as they emerge.\n\nBut we already have learned enough to know that the government whistle-blower is correct to say \u201cthat the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d We know this latest instance is part of a history of repeated injuries and usurpations. We may not yet know whether removal from the office to which President Trump was elected is warranted. But surely we know enough to judge that Mr. Trump does not deserve renomination for that office for an additional four years.\n\nThe Republican Party faces a binary choice. It either will or will not renominate Donald Trump in 2020. (And if President Trump is removed as a consequence of impeachment and conviction, or if he resigns, the G.O.P. either will or will not nominate as its standard-bearer a newly sworn-in Mike Pence, who will have been at Mr. Trump\u2019s side for his entire administration and has been a fervent defender of the president.)", "description": "The party can do better.", "authors": ["William Kristol"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/opinion/30Kristol1/30Kristol1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
