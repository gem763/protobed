The average of 2.79 homers per game has dropped to 2.45 in the postseason, with 76 long balls in 31 games entering Wednesday.\n\nA May 2018 report to Major League Baseball by professors specializing in physics, mechanical engineering, statistics and mathematics concluded there was less drag on the ball, causing more home runs. The cause of the decrease in drag has not been explained.\n\n\u201cI think that analysis based on large sample sizes, meaning season-long samples, is really the most reliable research,\u201d Manfred said before World Series Game 2. \u201cVariables like weather and who is pitching, that all washes out in a very large sample. When you start picking three days in the postseason where the weather\u2019s different, you get the very best pitching in the game, it becomes less reliable.\u201d\n\nManfred dismissed speculation that postseason baseballs are different than the ones used during the regular season.\n\n\u201cI can tell you one thing for absolute certain: Just like every other year, the balls that were used in this postseason were selected from lots that were used during the regular season,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no difference in those baseballs.\u201d\n\nHouston pitcher Justin Verlander has been among the players most outspoken about changes to baseballs this year.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day as well, whether you\u2019re a hitter or whether you\u2019re a pitcher, you\u2019re looking for consistency,\u201d union head Tony Clark said. \u201cAnd there is nobody more equipped to appreciate the differences in the ball and or how it\u2019s affecting the play than the guys that are on the field. It\u2019s an interesting exercise to have guys close your eyes and lay out balls and be able to tell the difference between the ball with their eyes closed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred discounts the drop in home runs during the postseason and expects to receive a new report from scientists on baseballs by the end of the year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/world_series_nationals_astros_baseball_23570_c0-228-5472-3420_s1200x700.jpg?f89739662670662341638fe34403095f75f3e118", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
