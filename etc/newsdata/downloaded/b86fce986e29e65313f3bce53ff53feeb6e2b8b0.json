She is, after all, one of our patron saints of ros\u00e9wave, the seasonally-appropriate soundtrack meant to encompass the full spectrum of summertime living. Jepsen's new album, Dedicated, is out now.\n\nThis is a bit of an odd shuffle of songs because that's how I listen to music. Old and new and everything in-between. These songs remind me of my kinda chill summertime, though. Some sad, but mostly happy and all epic artists. These are artists worth digging into more if you don't know 'em yet. I think I'll title it, \"Living room dance party at mine?\" Thanks for listening; go drink the ros\u00e9 and enjoy!", "description": "The pop singer offers a ros\u00e9wave playlist for a chill summertime: \"Some sad, but mostly happy and all epic artists.\"", "authors": ["Carly Rae Jepsen"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/07/15/carly-2019-7-by-markus-koala_wide-4e0ff1b42871533ecfd411be0e009fd5b78f5fb1.jpg?s=1400"}
