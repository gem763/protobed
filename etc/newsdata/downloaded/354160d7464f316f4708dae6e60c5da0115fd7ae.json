Hopefully, we know how to play within his outlook of the game, and put together a performance accordingly.\"\n\nLouw, who has 74 Test matches to his name, is expected to be named on the bench for Sunday's clash.\n\nKick-off is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Francois Louw says that referee Jerome Garces is not cause for concern heading into Sunday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Wales in Yokohama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2834/0c93d0310c5a4794a53dca4bc4e1dc3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
