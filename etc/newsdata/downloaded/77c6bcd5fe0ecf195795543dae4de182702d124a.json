They arrived to find the boat engulfed in flames, tweeting a picture of the scene.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said that a group of five crew members has been rescued, one with minor injuries with efforts continuing to locate the remaining passengers. Four of the crew members were brought back to shore, while the captain remains at the scene, CNN reported.\n\n\n\nThe crew was sleeping in the main cabin, while 34 passengers were sleeping below deck when the fire broke out.\n\nThe Ventura Country Fire Department initially told local TV station KTLA5 that all 34 of the passengers had died, but a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard would not confirm that.\n\nCapt. Brian McGrath of the Ventura County Fire Department subsequently confirmed in a statement that there were at least some fatalities but would not say how many.\n\n\n\n\"We're still holding hope that someone may have swam to shore,\u201d Mike Eliason from the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, said. \u201cWhen they anchor overnight they're pretty close to shore. We have to hope, but we plan for the worst-case scenario.\u201d\n\nThe 75-foot boat that caught fire was named Conception and is based in Santa Barbara Harbor. The boat has a maximum capacity of 46 people and operated year-round, according to the website California Diving News. It launched in 1981, the website said.\n\n\n\nThe Conception set out from Santa Barbara on Saturday and, based on information from MarineTraffic.com, it visited several diving spots around Santa Cruz Island and was due to return to Santa Barbara on Monday evening.\n\nAn image of the sleeping quarters of the Conception shows rows of wooden bunks with reading lights and privacy curtains.\n\nThis is a developing story\n\n\n\nCover: In this photo provided by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, firefighters work to extinguish a dive boat engulfed in flames after a deadly fire broke out aboard the commercial scuba diving vessel off the Southern California Coast Monday morning, Sept. 2, 2019.
