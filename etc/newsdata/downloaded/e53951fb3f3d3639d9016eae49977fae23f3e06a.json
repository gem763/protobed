At this point, I am not a supporter of Libra. I don't know what it is, I don't think that that has been adequately explained.\"\n\nShe went on to say, \"I don't think that he [Zuckerberg] should be moving forward with this huge project \u2014 this big idea, with all these other concerns that have not really been resolved.\"\n\nProponents say prohibition could stifle innovation\n\nA number of representatives on the Financial Services Committee stated that not acting fast on Libra could lead to the U.S. being left behind and losing its spot as a global leader in finance and innovation. Rep. Patrick McHenry began his comments by declaring, \u201cToday is a trial on American innovation.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the Facebook founder noted that China was working on a digital version of its national currency that, should it come to fruition before a dollar-backed project like Libra, could threaten the economic and geopolitical position of the U.S., he claimed.\n\nZuckerberg also said, \"The financial industry is stagnant. There is no digital financial architecture to support the innovation that we need. [...] I don\u2019t know if Libra is going to work, but I believe in trying new things.\u201d\n\nIn her statements after the hearing, Waters noted that she supports innovation, but first needs to know what the project is and how it operates before the government gives the green light to the Libra Association, which could manage a potentially staggering amount of wealth.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury is monitoring Libra\n\nIn a separate hearing yesterday, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin stated that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which operates under the Treasury's purview, has created a working group to monitor cryptocurrencies and Libra.\n\nMnuchin added that participant institutions in the Libra Association may be one avenue through which the FSOC regulates the project.", "description": "Libra Hearing Fails to Assuage Senior Lawmakers' Concerns | News by Cointelegraph", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5ldS1jZW50cmFsLTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMTktMTAvY2Y5ZjQ1N2EtMGI5ZC00MTA5LTk0ODAtMTdjMWRiYjk4MWViLmpwZw==.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
