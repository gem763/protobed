Yet, the show lost in most of the major categories: Its finale failed to win for writing and directing, and among its 10 performance nominees, only one triumphed. In the end, 10 of its 12 record-tying honors had been picked up at the Creative Arts Emmys the weekend before.\n\nRead: A \u2018ridiculous\u2019 Emmys night for \u2018Fleabag\u2019\n\nThe Emmys delivered a clear message: Game of Thrones was a cultural monolith, but it wouldn\u2019t be awarded for its final season\u2019s technical and storytelling chops. Even the showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss seemed relieved while collecting their final trophies for the series: \u201cI can\u2019t believe we finished it,\u201d Benioff marveled. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Added Weiss, addressing his family: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry we were gone for so long. We hope someday you decide it was all worth it.\u201d For a win that had the audience deliver a standing ovation, the remarks felt subdued, rather than celebratory.\n\nThen again, that speech arrived immediately after perhaps the most electric of acceptance of the night. The address Phoebe Waller-Bridge gave when her series Fleabag won Outstanding Comedy Series was an elated, vibrant, and welcome game-changer late into the ceremony. (She even yielded the floor to her co-stars and crew, to hilarious effect, as the director Harry Bradbeer gamely stepped up the mic to apologize to his wife for forgetting to thank her in his earlier speech.) The comedy arena had been a toss-up leading up to the show. Even awards prognosticators had been uncertain whether Amazon\u2019s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel would repeat its success or if Fleabag would break through; the odds for either winning had been projected to be the same, along with Veep\u2019s.\n\nWith those final speeches, the Emmys demonstrated a truth about the way Hollywood awards its own\u2014as satisfying as it was to watch an objectively excellent series win its honors, it was just as important for a mainstream project to be accepted by the filmmaking community and cemented as an influential show, regardless of the quality of its finale. Fleabag\u2019s win was delightful; Game of Thrones\u2019 felt perfunctory\u2014but if Thrones hadn\u2019t been awarded at all, the Emmys would have seemed out of touch.\n\nRead: The Emmys missed the point of having no host\n\nPlus, it\u2019s not like Thrones bombed on Emmys night. It broke the record for number of nods with its 32 nominations. Peter Dinklage won his fourth Emmy for playing the troubled Tyrion Lannister, and the series itself walked away with the top prize. But the real victory lap for the show took place months ago, when fans tuned in to the final season.\n\n\n\nStill, to the cast and crew behind the show, being together to celebrate their series meant more than any amount of awards. \u201cComing from another country, you know, to be [a part of] the \u2018best\u2019 show, it\u2019s such a nice experience,\u201d the Emmy-nominated Dutch actor Carice Van Houten, who played Melisandre on Thrones, told me as the party wound down. Being on stage and getting to read a few scripted lines with her peers felt \u201cpretty good,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI was very happy.\u201d Minutes later, she slipped out of the party with other members of the cast as they wandered off to drop by more after-parties. The first stop, allegedly? Netflix\u2019s bash, just a few minutes of a car ride away.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
