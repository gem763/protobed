That was especially true for Objects In Space, which quickly became one of the darlings of the Australian indie circuit after people saw the intricate physical spaceship that the developers made. But what most people didn't see was the raw cost: the game's development blew out from 2 years to 5, the creators had to refinance four separate times to get over the line, and the impact on the creators' relationship took such a toll that they're still recovering well after release.\n\nLeigh Harris, the co-founder and one half of Flat Earth Games alongside his sister Elissa, gave an honest breakdown of Objects' development from a game that started out as a submarine simulator in space, to one that required multiple dialogue rewrites, a complete rework from 2D to 3D assets, the creation of new systems that ultimately required existing mechanics be redesigned to cope with the changes, and all the problems along the way.\n\nThe initial scope for Objects was ambitious, but it was the kind of ambition that could have been delivered in a few years. They grew up on a lot of oldschool PC games, including the Microprose simulators of eras past, and they loved open worlds. But learning from the amount of outsourcing they needed for Towncraft, the creators figured that not rendering a live view of space would reduce the amount of art necessary.\n\nImage: Objects In Space\n\nThat ended up being the case, but the studio ended up spending more time in development because of the flow-on effects \u2014 information had to be communicated to the player in other ways, and the decisions about how that panned out ended up becoming very complicated.\n\nHarris outlined the complication in the most classic of ways: a flowchart. Things began fairly simply with the spaceship itself. It was designed like a sub, and so the team needed the basic systems that go with that: sensors, engineering, power management, and so on.\n\nBecause the game was open-world, Flat Earth also had to make quests to give the player a reason to travel from one star system to another. They designed around 120 of those, and about 60 space stations to go with it. The space stations all had to be unique, because that was the main visual connection the player had with the universe outside of their spaceship, and they needed to be able to visually identify the different \"sectors\" of space \u2014 the pirate system, a more corporate system, working-class mining areas.\n\n\"We both suffered serious major depression trying to get through this game\"\n\nBut it's here that the problems started to emerge.\n\nThe space stations, which were spread across 30 star systems, needed to be populated with multiple characters. They had to feel alive, especially since the player character is never really visible in Objects. The creators also wanted Objects to feel more natural, and so they added branching dialogue trees and no player HUD. \"We wanted to feel like you weren't playing too much of a video game,\" Harris explained. \"We want NPCs to be vending machines where you put in a click and they give you information about the game world.\"\n\nIn retrospect, it was possibly one of the worst decisions they made. The branching dialogue trees made sense for the real-time, always progressing nature of the Objects world \u2014 everything is always moving forward, so it made sense that the conversation system did too. But it meant that the in-game world, and all of the NPCs that lived within it, had to accommodate that.\n\nAnd then the problems got worse.\n\nA decision was made early on that the player in Objects would interact with everything through in-game monitors. If you were flying a ship, you were getting the information from a screen that existed in the in-game universe exactly where you'd find it on that ship. It was rustic, authentic, and did a banger of a job echoing that classic spacefarer experience from the late '80s and '90s.\n\nBut naturally, that made life hell on earth for the Harris developers later on.\n\nThey needed to switch the game engine from 2D to 3D, because the way information was disseminated through the in-game monitors meant those textures needed to exist in a 3D space. And that meant the character design went from 2D to 3D as well, and the space stations needed a total rework along with it.\n\nIf those were the only problems, things might not have been so hard. But the natural tension of a sub simulator meant that Flat Earth Games had to create a whole separate system \u2014 a safe tutorial space, if you will \u2014 where the player could learn all the systems, die without too many consequences, and get to grips with the multiple progression systems without worrying about the constant passage of time.\n\nPlayer freedom posed more problems. Early player feedback on Objects was that people wanted the ability to say something during conversations with NPCs, and that forced a rewrite of all the dialogue scripts so the player had an option when they wanted to speak \u2014 and also so the game factored in what happened after that point.\n\nIt caused massive complications with the ships, too. The ships themselves in Objects don't have classes or their own stats: they're simply the sum of the parts you choose to put together. That means you're not restricted from building a hybrid fighter/cargo deal, or becoming a merchant and completely swapping all the parts out for something more aggressive, and so on.\n\nBut that also means it's technically possible for a player to put together a ship that just ... doesn't work. Logically, Harris explained, no-one in their right mind would do that.\n\n\"Most of the money the game has made thus far has been recouped by other people, so that's the real tangible cost\"\n\nBut what if they did?\n\nThe developers quickly found out that they couldn't institute a simple flag that prevented players from leaving a space station with a ship that couldn't fly, because that caused too many problems if a player ship got crippled during the middle of a journey.\n\nSo they had to build three more systems to account for this. The first was an SOS system, allowing players who couldn't make it back to base to get hauled back in. You can't call the space NRMA or RACV without paying a fee, but what if the player didn't have enough money to get home?\n\nSo the second system was made: debt. And if the principle of debt exists in your space universe, then you also need to create some kind of mechanism where that debt gets tracked and collected.\n\nWhich is where the bounty system came in.\n\nA shot of the ever expanding Objects in Space flowchart showing the interdepencies between the various systems, and just how intricate and problematic the feature creep became. Image: Alex Walker (Kotaku)\n\nHaving the bounty system meant that the quests, scripts and all other kinds of interactions had to be rewritten, because now the game had to factor in this mechanism for punishing the player as a consequence. Transporting people is a large part of the merchant and mission system in the game, but what if you decided to effectively take someone hostage instead of just ferrying them to their destination? The bounty hunters need to be called in, and if the player needs to do that, then the NPCs you talk to in the in-game world \u2014 and any quests they dole out \u2014 have to factor it in too.\n\nEven little things became harder work than they first thought. When the game went into early access, players asked the Objects team if they could have filters for buying and selling items at space stations. OK, but small problem: the amount of space the team had to work with was 320x200, which isn't a lot of room to squeeze a UI into. A ton of UI work already had to be done for the in-game PDA tracker, which was necessary to help the player keep track of everything, especially all the quests and procedurally generated events which would expire after a certain time.\n\nIt's no surprise that the game's development blew out by five years and, consequently, the amount of money needed. The studio initially got by with their own funds and some grant money from the NSW Government \u2014 a rarity given the state's approach to funding video games \u2014 but they quickly realised they would need much more.\n\nFortunately, the amount of excitement generated around the game's showing at various conventions \u2014 a lot generated by the interest in the spaceship-esque controller \u2014 meant investors and publishers wanted a piece of Objects in Space, which made the process a little easier. \"We found a totally unique selling point and we leveraged it hard,\" Harris said.\n\nAn Aussie Indie Game Inspired Me To Build My Own Spaceship Cockpit Objects In Space is an open world stealth space trading game currently being built by Sydney-based indie studio Flat Earth Games. When I say built, I mean that literally \u2014 to go along with the game's retrofuture, modempunk aesthetic and heavily tactile and complex interface, the team has mocked up its own real-world spaceship control panel, complete with LEDs and VU meters and missile switches.

But if you're not sure what the game is like, here's what to expect from the opening salvo. Read more\n\nBut to keep going, the studio had to leverage future sales not once, but multiple times. One of the main artists on the game was also receiving a share of the game's profits. That became a particular burden for the Flat Earth Games co-founders, Harris explained, because they badly wanted to make sure they got what they were owed \u2014 and the longer the situation dragged on, the greater toll it took on their mental health. \"The amount of guilt we felt about that was immense ... we both suffered serious major depression trying to get through this game,\" Harris said.\n\n\"I think as we got into that really dark patch, we got there slowly. And as you've seen from the flowchart, we got there one piece at a time, but going and getting back into full time work, I can hold conversations a lot better, I can retain a lot of information better now ... on every level I can see the difference now.\"\n\nIt also took an enormous toll on the relationship between the co-founders, one which hasn't recovered. A key skill in any office is the ability to talk about conflict and find a resolution, and Harris explained that while that was something his fellow co-founder and sister excelled at, there is a limit to the amount of conflict humans can work through. \"The tension of getting on each other's nerves, we're still trying to recover from that experience,\" Harris, who has since taken a job with Wargaming Sydney as a senior producer, said.\n\nThe end result is that Objects in Space is a game the creators are extremely proud of \u2014 but they're also very, very happy to leave it alone for a while. \"We had to take on a lot of money from publishers, investors, government grants to get us there ... most of the money the game has made thus far has been recouped by other people, so that's the real tangible cost,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris said there's no way the original vision could have been realised with the original budget or timeline. The only way to accomplish that would have been to make a combat sub simulator in space with the size and scope of something like Silent Service, but that wasn't the game either of them set out to make.\n\nStill, after five years of development, their Objects in Space vision was fully realised. For now, Harris is happy enjoying the stability of full-time work, a fortnightly pay cycle with the security of annual leave and superannuation, and the freedom of not having a leveraged sword of Damocles over their head.\n\n\"We made something we're really proud of, and I'm proud we built it,\" Harris said. \"We should not have made those mistakes. Still cool, though.\"\n\nThe author's accommodation throughout Melbourne International Games Week, GCAP and PAX Australia 2019 was provided courtesy of Airbnb.", "description": "Game development is a brutal, long process.
