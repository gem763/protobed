Kardashian West announced a ride-sharing program to help former prisoners get transportation. (June 13) AP\n\nKim Kardashian West, the reality star who has been stepping into the worlds of politics and social activism, praised Greta Thunberg and said she wants to meet the teenage climate activist.\n\nSixteen-year-old Thunberg made international headlines after appearing at the UN Climate Action Summit last month, making an impassioned plea to the world to rein in emissions.\n\n\"People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing ... and all you talk about is money and eternal fairy tales of economic growth. How dare you?\" she addressed world leaders, her voice cracking with emotion. \"For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away?\"\n\nKardashian West was clearly impressed by Thunberg's stance.\n\n\u201cShe is such an amazing young girl, and so brave and courageous to stand up to these grown-ups that can be very scary and for her to be so open and honest is exactly what we need,\u201d Kardashian West, 38, said in an interview with Reuters while visiting Armenia for the World Congress on Information Technology.\n\nKardashian West also told Reuters that she was interested in speaking with Thunberg's parents about the ins and outs of navigating \"speaking on a big platform,\" which \"invites a lot of different opinions and personalities.\"\n\n'Stay Strong': Anne Hathaway, more celebs send support to Greta Thunberg amid bullying\n\nKim Kardashian says she wants to meet with teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg.

And she's met a handful of times with President Donald Trump, whom her husband Kanye West is an avid and vocal supporter of, to discuss criminal justice reform issues.\n\nContributing: Sara M.
