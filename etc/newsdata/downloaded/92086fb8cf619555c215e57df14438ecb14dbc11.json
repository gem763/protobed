Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nShale companies have helped the U.S. become the world\u2019s top oil producer, at more than 12 million barrels a day, by unlocking crude from dense rock formations using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. But many of the companies have yet to show they can deliver consistent returns or live within their means as oil prices hover above $50 a barrel.\n\nAs a result, shale stocks have reached historic lows, with many companies all but cut off from capital markets and some filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\nProducers, who must now prove to investors they can rein in their spending and deliver returns, are peppering their speech with terms such as \u201ccapital discipline\u201d and \u201clive within cash flow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year was a transition year for us, and we entered the year harder on capital and also harder on production,\u201d Concho Resources Inc. CEO Tim Leach told analysts on the company\u2019s earnings call in August. \u201c[W]e are continuing to drive that number down...and demonstrate our ability to show capital discipline and live within cash flow.\u201d\n\nIN: Bigger returns OUT: Promises of growth 100 mentions 100 mentions \u2018free cash flow\u2019 \u2018production growth\u2019 \u2018dividend\u2019 \u2018buyback\u2019 \u2018rate of return\u2019 \u2018ramp up\u2019 0 0 2015 \u201919 2015 \u201919 IN: Bigger returns OUT: Promises of growth 100 mentions 100 mentions \u2018free cash flow\u2019 \u2018production growth\u2019 \u2018dividend\u2019 \u2018buyback\u2019 \u2018rate of return\u2019 \u2018ramp up\u2019 0 0 2015 \u201919 2015 \u201919 IN: Bigger returns OUT: Promises of growth 100 mentions 100 mentions \u2018free cash flow\u2019 \u2018production growth\u2019 \u2018dividend\u2019 \u2018buyback\u2019 \u2018rate of return\u2019 \u2018ramp up\u2019 0 0 2015 \u201919 2015 \u201919 IN: Bigger returns 100 mentions \u2018free cash flow\u2019 \u2018dividend\u2019 \u2018buyback\u2019 0 2015 \u201919 OUT: Promises of growth 100 mentions \u2018production growth\u2019 \u2018rate of return\u2019 \u2018ramp up\u2019 0 2015 \u201919\n\nThe trendiest term in the shale industry right now might be \u201cfree cash flow.\u201d It has become synonymous with the promise by many companies of late to not spend beyond their income and to generate profits, which might then be returned to investors. Not surprisingly, the phrase\u2019s increased usage has coincided with a jump in the frequency of two other words investors favor: \u201cdividend\u201d and \u201cbuyback.\u201d\n\nThat is a shift from the lexicon the companies used when touting the breakneck growth many pursued. Terms such as \u201cproduction growth\u201d were popular in 2015, but not anymore.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to build debt in this environment, so there\u2019s a lot of reasons why I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see the long-term growth,\u201d Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. , said on the company\u2019s August earnings call.\n\nBy some measures, the companies are delivering on their promises. During the second quarter of 2019, roughly 80% of 43 large U.S. independent producers generated profits, up from about 40% during the first quarter, according to a Journal analysis of FactSet data.\n\nThe challenges facing the industry aren\u2019t just financial, but technical as well. For years, shale companies told investors that they could boost production by placing wells in closer proximity, but have since found that doing so often means the wells produce less as they draw down the same resource, as the Journal reported in March.\n\nThe industry has dubbed the issue the parent-child well problem. Some companies have begun disclosing that planned, or child, wells will produce less than existing, or parent, wells. When Concho made such a disclosure in August, its stock fell 22% in one day.\n\nIn addition to acknowledging the issue, some companies are telling investors they plan to space their wells farther apart to address it, a reversal from years past when they promised to \u201cdownspace\u201d their wells, or drill them more closely.\n\n\u201c[W]e recognize the parent-child relationship and the importance of proper spacing to develop the assets correctly,\u201d EOG Resources Inc. CEO William Thomas said on the company\u2019s August earnings call.\n\nIN: Spacing out oil wells OUT: Packing them together 30 mentions 30 mentions \u2018parent-child\u2019 \u2018wider spacing\u2019 \u2018downspacing\u2019 \u2018tighter spacing\u2019 0 0 2015 \u201919 2015 \u201919 IN: Spacing out oil wells OUT: Packing them together 30 mentions 30 mentions \u2018parent-child\u2019 \u2018wider spacing\u2019 \u2018downspacing\u2019 \u2018tighter spacing\u2019 0 0 2015 \u201919 2015 \u201919 IN: Spacing out oil wells OUT: Packing them together 30 mentions 30 mentions \u2018parent-child\u2019 \u2018wider spacing\u2019 \u2018downspacing\u2019 \u2018tighter spacing\u2019 0 0 2015 \u201919 2015 \u201919 IN: Spacing out oil wells 30 mentions \u2018parent-child\u2019 \u2018wider spacing\u2019 0 2015 \u201919 OUT: Packing them together 30 mentions \u2018downspacing\u2019 \u2018tighter spacing\u2019 0 2015 \u201919\n\nAs shale companies curb their ambitions, they are also talking more narrowly about their real estate.\n\nIn the early days of the shale boom, producers raced to acquire land in emerging drilling regions. Many companies touted new oil finds in the DJ Basin and Niobrara shale in Colorado and three adjacent states. Others boasted to investors about their holdings in the Scoop and Stack basins in Oklahoma.\n\nIN: The Permian Basin OUT: Everywhere else 100 mentions 100 mentions Permian Eagle Ford Scoop/Stack Niobrara/DJ Bakken 0 0 2015 \u201919 2015 \u201919 IN: The Permian Basin OUT: Everywhere else 100 mentions 100 mentions Permian Eagle Ford Scoop/Stack Niobrara/DJ Bakken 0 0 2015 \u201919 2015 \u201919 IN: The Permian Basin OUT: Everywhere else 100 mentions 100 mentions Permian Eagle Ford Scoop/Stack Niobrara/DJ Bakken 0 0 2015 \u201919 2015 \u201919 IN: The Permian Basin 100 mentions Permian 0 2015 \u201919 OUT: Everywhere else 100 mentions Eagle Ford Scoop/Stack Niobrara/DJ Bakken 0 2015 \u201919\n\nBut as financing dries up, and returns become more valued than growth, many companies are retreating to the sweetest spots in the best basins and shutting down drilling rigs elsewhere, a shift reflected in the geography executives mention on earnings calls.\n\n\u201c[W]e\u2019re in a price cycle here that we\u2019re seeing rigs go down in the U.S., four or five a week,\u201d Continental Resources Inc. CEO Harold Hamm said on the company\u2019s August earnings call. \u201cWhere the level is that we need to be at is anybody\u2019s guess, but I think we\u2019re probably 100 rigs more in the U.S. than is needed today.\u201d\n\nEven stalwart fields where the shale boom began, including Texas\u2019 Eagle Ford and North Dakota\u2019s Bakken, are declining in popularity with drillers. The safest bet for many companies, analysts say, is the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the country\u2019s most active drilling region.\n\nShale Shift The number of active drilling rigs has dropped everywhere since 2015 except in the Permian Basin.
