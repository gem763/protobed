The typhoon ripped through a wide area of the country earlier in early October, cutting off electricity and water supplies, causing mudslides and flooding tens of thousands of homes.\n\nWith another typhoon having brought torrential rains to Japan in late October, particularly in Chiba and Fukushima prefectures, nearly 3,700 people were still housed in shelters as of Monday.\n\nRyota Takeda, minister in charge of disaster management, told a press conference that the most recent typhoon and downpours in late October caused by a low pressure system should also be treated as a severe disaster.\n\n\"I believe it is a sequence of disasters\" that continued from Typhoon Hagibis, Takeda said.\n\nThe government will take over work requiring more complex technology to rebuild roads in five prefectures, including a road in Nagano damaged by the collapse of a bridge due to flooding.\n\nUnder a Japanese law to aid reconstruction after \"extraordinary\" disasters, the government also took a similar step in the aftermath of a major earthquake in Kumamoto Prefecture in 2016 that damaged basic infrastructure.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "The government decided Tuesday to increase its funding and assistance for reconstruction in Nagano and other prefectures ravaged by deadly Typhoon Hagibis, designating the disaster earlier in the month as \"severe.\" The decision made by the Cabinet is designed to reduce the financial burden being shouldered by local governments and\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://japantoday.com/images/japan-today-social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
