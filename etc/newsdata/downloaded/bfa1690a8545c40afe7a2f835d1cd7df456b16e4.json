Mr Trump has faced accusations of sexual misconduct for years, and has denied them all \u2013 including the infamous moment from the 2016 campaign trail when an audio tape was leaked of him discussing grabbing women \u201cby the p****\u201d without their consent.\n\nKaren Johnson spoke exclusively for the first time to Mr Levine and Ms El-Faizy about her claims of unwanted touching on the part of the president during a New Year\u2019s Eve party in the early 2000s.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

And I\u2019m a tall girl and I had six-inch heels on, and I still remember looking up at him. And he\u2019s strong, and he just kissed me.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI was so scared because of who he was ... I don\u2019t even know where it came from. I didn\u2019t have a say in the matter.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
