According to last year's TomTom Traffic Index, which measures the amount of time commuters spend sitting in traffic, Brussels is one of the most congested cities in Europe -- marginally worse than London.\n\nRelated content Commuters waste an average of 54 hours a year stalled in traffic, study says\n\nMarie Thibaut de Maisi\u00e8res, spokeswoman for the ministry, told CNN: \"Mobility in Brussels is one of the biggest issues.\"\n\nTalking about the city's poor air quality, she added: \"There's quite a big urgency (to change things). A health urgency. A social urgency, of course, because it creates neighborhoods that are not good for the people who live there.\"\n\nTo reduce the number of cars on the roads by 20%, the local government will offer a \"mobility as a service\" program through an app it is developing in conjunction with a tech start-up. This will allow commuters to share journeys and put otherwise wasted seats to good use.\n\nThe app will also bring together other forms of transportation, allowing users to choose the form most convenient for them on a given day.\n\nThe local government will make its ride-sharing program appealing -- especially to the 190,000 drivers who travel to Brussels from the French-speaking region of Wallonia each day -- by providing car parking spaces outside of the city for free or at a heavily reduced price. Drivers can then share lifts into the center.", "description": "Commuters in Brussels will be encouraged to hitch rides to work, as part of a local government bid to reduce congestion and carbon dioxide emissions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190927121305-01-brussels-highway-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
