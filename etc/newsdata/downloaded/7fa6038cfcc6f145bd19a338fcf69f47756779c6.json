The beast of a storm will continue to devastate parts of the Bahamas over the next 24 to 48 hours, all the while looming threateningly off the coast of the Southeast United States. Things are not nearly as dramatic around here. A weak cold front and a shallow low-level boundary will keep things a bit unsettled overnight and into the holiday, with showers and even some afternoon Labor Day thunderstorms a good bet.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: Mostly cloudy skies with a few spots of sunshine for the remainder of the day today. Scattered showers, especially east of D.C., are also likely. Mostly cloudy overnight with a spot shower or two and lows in the upper 60s to near 70 degrees. Winds become southerly at 5-10 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Labor Day): The holiday will start out mostly cloudy, with some isolated showers lingering in the morning hours. Partial sunshine should develop by the early afternoon, but that will come with an increased chance of isolated thunderstorms. Highs in the mid- to upper 80s with noticeable humidity. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will persist overnight tomorrow, with lows in the upper 60s.\n\nSee Brian Jackson\u2019s forecast through next week.

A lack of any substantial large-scale steering flow in the Caribbean will allow Dorian to meander off the coast of Florida for several days. This follows a period of rapid intensification, where the storm fed on favorable conditions to strengthen from a Category 1 hurricane into a Category 5 monster in under 48 hours.\n\n\n\nSeveral other areas of interest (yellow and orange marks) are being monitored for possible tropical development over the next several days. (NHC)\n\nSo what about the potential for other storms? As the image above displays, the favorable environment for tropical storm or hurricane development will remain in place regardless of what becomes of Dorian. Unfortunately, that means we most probably have not heard the last from land-threatening storms during this 2019 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
