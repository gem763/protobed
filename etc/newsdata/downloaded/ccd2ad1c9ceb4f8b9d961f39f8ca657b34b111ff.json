Today, wealthy actress Felicity Huffman got 14 days for paying $15K to rig her daughter's SAT scores. Huffman says she's \"deeply ashamed.\" pic.twitter.com/J6UxEkwWDL \u2014 AJ+ (@ajplus) September 13, 2019\n\nNope. Conveniently, the part about her being a drug dealer is getting left out:\n\nIf you're going to compare Felicity Huffman to Tanya McDowell, at least mention she went to jail for being a drug dealer? https://t.co/ply2qIJ8HC \u2014 Greg Pollowitz (@GPollowitz) September 13, 2019\n\nFrom the Connecticut Post (the \u201cNorwalk case\u201d is about her using a fake address to get her son into the better school):\n\n[Superior Court Judge Frank] Iannotti retorted Tuesday that the Norwalk case had nothing to do with why McDowell was before him. \u201cThis case is about the convictions for the sale of narcotics to an undercover police officer,\u201d the judge said. \u201cI think you understand that because that is really the essence of what has gotten you into the predicament you find yourself today.\u201d On the two counts of sale of narcotics, the judge then sentenced her to 12 years, suspended after she serves five years and followed by five years probation. The sentence is to run concurrently with a five-year sentence she received in the Norwalk case.\n\nOh, and her attorney is happy with the outcome:\n\nIn the end, both he and McDowell\u2019s lawyer, Darnell Crosland, said they were happy with the resolution of the cases.\n\n***\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated.", "description": "If you're going to scream \"white privilege,\" at least get the facts correct.", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ce0ae297-6734-4194-9e3e-af1ffc2f8654.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
