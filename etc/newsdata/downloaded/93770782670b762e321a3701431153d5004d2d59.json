REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Picture\n\nIt named the groups as Lazarus Group, Bluenoroff, and Andariel and said they were controlled by the RGB, North Korea\u2019s primary intelligence bureau, which is already subject to U.S. and United Nations sanctions.\n\nThe action blocks any U.S.-related assets of the groups and prohibits dealings with them. The Treasury statement said any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitated significant transactions or services for them could also be subject to sanctions.\n\n\u201cTreasury is taking action against North Korean hacking groups that have been perpetrating cyber attacks to support illicit weapon and missile programs,\u201d said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to enforce existing U.S. and U.N. sanctions against North Korea and work with the international community to improve cybersecurity of financial networks.\u201d\n\nThe United States has been attempting to restart talks with North Korea, aimed at pressing the country to give up its nuclear weapons. The talks have been stalled over North Korean demands for concessions, including sanctions relief.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea denied U.N. allegations it had obtained $2 billion through cyberattacks on banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, and accused the United States of spreading rumors.\n\nThe Treasury statement said Lazarus Group was involved in the WannaCry ransomware attack that the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom publicly attributed to North Korea in December 2017.\n\nIt said WannaCry affected at least 150 countries and shut down about 300,000 computers, including many in Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS). The NHS attack led to the cancellation of more than 19,000 appointments and ultimately cost the service over $112 million, the biggest known ransomware attack in history.\n\nThe Treasury said Lazarus Group was also directly responsible for 2014 cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nThe statement cited industry and press reporting as saying that by 2018, Bluenoroff had attempted to steal over $1.1 billion from financial institutions and successfully carried out operations against banks in Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Chile, and Vietnam.\n\nIt said Bluenoroff worked with the Lazarus Group to steal approximately $80 million from the Central Bank of Bangladesh\u2019s New York Federal Reserve account.\n\nAndariel, meanwhile, was observed by cyber security firms attempting to steal bank card information by hacking into ATMs to withdraw cash or steal customer information to later sell on the black market, the statement said.\n\nAndariel was also responsible for developing and creating unique malware to hack into online poker and gambling sites and, according to industry and press reporting, targeted the South Korea government military in an effort to gather intelligence, it said.", "description": "The U.S. Treasury on Friday announced sanctions on three North Korean hacking groups it said were involved in the \"WannaCry\" ransomware attacks and hacking of international banks and customer accounts.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429505255&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1SV", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
