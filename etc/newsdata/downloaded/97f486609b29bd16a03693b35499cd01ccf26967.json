Indeed, when he was tackled heavily early he rode the challenge brilliantly with a cute side-step.\n\nWith a quick winger outside him he unselfishly fed him at every opportunity to expose a leaden-footed left back. But it was his skill that caught the eye. In one exquisite movement, for example, he switched the ball from left foot to right to left in a yard of space to slalom past another startled defender.\n\nThe 16-year-old has been catapulted into the first team but is coping with the demands\n\nWhat also made me sit up was a run off the ball to take a defender from a wide position into the box, making space for a colleague\u2019s pass to another player. That was outstanding. On top of that, when he failed with a one-two, he was alert to the danger and responsible enough to recover.\n\nAgainst a 4-3-3, he and his central colleague captured the midfield. Bellingham can also wriggle out of challenges and has an eye for goal.\n\nWhat does he need?\n\nWhen a defender pulled him down after a bit of trickery, he took exception. It looks like he will have to manage a short fuse.\n\nHe coped physically on the whole, however, and though he was substituted, he did not look short of stamina.\n\nIt looks like he will have to manage a short fuse but Bellingham is a real talent\n\nVery few people could imagine the brilliant Trevor Francis would have his record as Birmingham\u2019s youngest debutant broken. But Bellingham has it now (16 years and 38 days).\n\nThis youngster looks to have the tools and the belief.\n\nHis progress now will depend on his character and some guidance to help him cope with this early fame.", "description": "Our scout is a top football expert searching for the next star.
