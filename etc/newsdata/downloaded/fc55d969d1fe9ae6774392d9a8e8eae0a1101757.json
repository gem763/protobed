But the Times reports that, privately, Mr Barnier warned the UK must move further.\n\nThe dramatic developments mean talks could now go down to the wire ahead of the two-day European Council summit on Thursday.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nAny deal would then still need to get through Parliament, where the Tory Prime Minister has a majority hovering around minus 50.\n\nIt comes after Mr Johnson unveiled plans for a Brexit deal that would involve creating two borders in Northern Ireland - one on single market rules with Britain, and one on customs rules with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe BBC reported that the UK has dropped a demand that the deal on single market rules should include a veto for the Stormont Assembly.\n\nAnd deputy Irish premier Simon Coveney said: \"A deal is possible, and it's possible this month, may even be possible this week. But we're not there yet.\"\n\nMr Coveney also said there is still \"a lot\" of work to do.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nUK and EU officials will resume talks in the Belgian capital today, with the prospects of an agreement in time for Britain to leave with a deal on October 31 in the balance.\n\nMr Johnson is expected to speak to Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Claude Juncker within the next two days, according to the Times.\n\nEarlier, Mr Johnson told senior ministers that, while a \"pathway\" to a deal could still be seen, there was \"still a significant amount of work to get there\".\n\nIn a Cabinet conference call, he said they still had to be prepared to leave on Halloween without a deal.\n\nAnd Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg has said the Government could achieve a no-deal Brexit by using European law.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\" Theresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK,\" he said on BBC's Radio 4 Westminster Hour.\n\n\"And the Remainiacs all know that, because they know that it takes two to tango and any extension has to be agreed by the council.\"\n\nThe sticking point remains the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop intended to guarantee there is no return of a hard border with the Republic.\n\nMr Barnier was reported to have raised concern about the complexity of a British plan to keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs territory while avoiding the need for border controls.\n\nThere were reported be doubts about the feasibility of the scheme which was said to involve tracking goods as they move through Northern Ireland and then determining the tariff to be paid depending where they end up.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt raised the prospect that negotiations could carry on after this week, with the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any 11th hour agreement.\n\nHowever if Mr Johnson cannot get a deal by the weekend, he will come under intense pressure to seek a further Brexit delay, something he has vowed not to do.\n\nLabour however has warned that if necessary it will take action through the courts to force him to comply with the co-called Benn Act which requires to request an extension.\n\nEither way, the stage is set for a major Commons showdown when the Prime Minister returns to Westminster for an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament, the first in 37 years.\n\nIf he cannot get a deal, he is widely expected to blame MPs for cutting the ground from under him, laying the ground for a \"people versus Parliament\" general election .\n\nIf he is able to get an agreement, Government sources have said they will seek to rush through legislation to ratify it in time for the promised Halloween withdrawal date.\n\n(Image: via REUTERS)\n\nSome opposition MPs have signalled they could support an agreement if there was a requirement to put it to the public in a confirmatory referendum.\n\nHowever Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated he had little enthusiasm for the idea.\n\n\"I think many in Parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be more inclined to support it (if there was a referendum) even if they don't really agree with the deal. But I would caution them,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile Boris Johnson unveiled plans to hold his first full Budget - just a week after Brexit.\n\nThe Prime Minister gave Chancellor Sajid Javid the go-ahead for a full-blown financial statement on November 6.\n\nYet Tory ministers admit the date only applies if there is a Brexit deal - not in a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIf there's a no-deal Brexit, Treasury officials admitted, there would first be \"early action\" to support the economy, followed by a Budget \"in the weeks thereafter\".", "description": "Brexit talks could now go down to the wire on Wednesday after EU chiefs privately warned there is more movement needed from the UK side", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Gavin Cordon", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "Afp Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561261.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_British-PM-Announces-Funding-Commitments-For-UK-Schools.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
