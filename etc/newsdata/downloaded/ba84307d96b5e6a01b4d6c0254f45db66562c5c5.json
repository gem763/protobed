Accepting Saddam Hussein\u2019s explanation that the attack, which killed 37 sailors, had been an accident, American officials promptly used the incident, which came at the height of the Iran-Iraq war, to ratchet up pressure on Tehran. The incident provided the impetus for what became a brief, and all but forgotten, maritime war between the United States and Iran.\n\nLast week, someone \u2014 precisely who remains to be determined \u2014 attacked two oil refineries in Saudi Arabia. American authorities have been quick to blame Iran, and the possibility of a violent confrontation between the two countries is once again growing. Before making a decision on whether to pull the trigger, President Trump would do well to reflect on that 1987 episode and its legacy.\n\nBack then, the United States had become involved in the very bloody and seemingly interminable Iran-Iraq war, which Hussein had instigated in 1980 by invading Iran. As that war turned into a brutal stalemate, President Ronald Reagan and his advisers persuaded themselves that it was in America\u2019s interests to come to Iraq\u2019s aid. Iran was the \u201cenemy\u201d so Iraq became America\u2019s \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nAfter the Stark episode, American and Iranian naval forces in the Gulf began jousting, an uneven contest that culminated in April 1988 with the virtual destruction of the Iranian Navy.", "description": "After last week\u2019s refinery attack, Trump should be careful about throwing America\u2019s weight behind an unreliable \u201cally.\u201d", "authors": ["Andrew J.
