Like previous NHL champions, they decided to keep with the long-held tradition of visiting the president at the White House amid teams from the NBA and other leagues either declining or not receiving an invitation or being disinvited by Trump.\n\nSt. Louis has a heavy concentration of Canadians and just one American still on the roster from the group that beat the Boston Bruins in the Cup Final. Every returning player from the Cup champions took the tour, met with Trump and was present for the ceremony in the Rose Garden.\n\n\u201cNo matter what we do, we do it as a group,\u201d alternate captain Alex Steen said. \u201cI think that\u2019s how we won. We\u2019re a very tight-knit group.\u201d\n\nTrump veered off into talk about bringing soldiers home from overseas and the stock market and revealed Vice President Mike Pence was traveling to Turkey to try to reach a ceasefire deal. When he circled back to the Blues, he went through their improbable run from last place in the league to champions with nods to Steen, owner Tom Stillman, captain Alex Pietrangelo, goaltender Jordan Binnington, forward Jaden Schwartz - who he called \u201cJason\u201d - and playoff MVP Ryan O\u2019Reilly.\n\n\u201cBeing able to see (the Oval) Office and get a tour of the White House, it doesn\u2019t get much better than that,\u201d said Schwartz, who acknowledged he might have a new nickname. \u201cThis is (something) you\u2019ll remember forever.\u201d\n\nTrump even mentioned the Blues adopting Laura Branigan\u2019s 1982 hit \u201cGloria\u201d as their victory song, and the U.S. Marine Band played the team into the ceremony with that tune. Young fan Laila Anderson, who was the team\u2019s inspiration while she fought a rare auto-immune disease, got her own mention.\n\n\u201cYou inspired the Blues all season, and today you continue to inspire all Americans,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe all know your story.\u201d\n\nStillman, who presented Trump with a No. 45 Blues jersey, called it a \u201clight-hearted, fun kind of celebration.\u201d He echoed Steen\u2019s sentiments about why the entire team showed up - a departure from when goaltender Braden Holtby and forward Brett Connolly skipped the 2018 champion Washington Capitals\u2019 visit in March in support of teammate Devante Smith-Pelly.\n\n\u201cI think this team acts as a team in everything they do,\u201d Stillman said. \u201cThey stick together. By and large, (I) like to keep politics and sports separate. This is a matter of a traditional honor, being invited to the White House by the presidency. It\u2019s something you do. I\u2019m really proud of our group for all coming together and having a good time of it, as well.\u201d\n\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman; Pence\u2019s wife, Karen; and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Josh Hawley of Missouri were among those in attendance for the half-hour ceremony.\n\nCoach Craig Berube stressed the notion of the Blues\u2019 playoff run as a team effort and brushed off Trump\u2019s comment that the pressure was off after winning.\n\n\u201cWe won the Stanley Cup, I think, once we got our team working together and playing together,\u201d Berube said. \u201cWhen you play as a team, day in and day out - hard - you\u2019re going to be hard to beat. So that\u2019s what it basically boiled down to. These guys all came together as a team and played for each other, and we ended up being champions.\u201d\n\nThe Blues paraded down the streets of St. Louis, raised their championship banner, donated a Cup ring to the Hockey Hall of Fame and capped it all off by going to the White House. Now, players are eager to move on to trying to do it all again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new year and new challenges and experiences,\u201d Binnington said. \u201cWe kind of still have this stuff lingering around, but obviously it\u2019s positive and it\u2019s amazing to experience that. But at the same time, yeah, it\u2019s back to work and simplify things a little bit. It\u2019ll be nice.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Donald Trump honored the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues on Tuesday, using the occasion to announce an envoy to Turkey, mention the economy and an agriculture deal with China and laugh off the possibility of impeachment.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/trump_43923_c0-228-5472-3420_s1200x700.jpg?f89739662670662341638fe34403095f75f3e118", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
