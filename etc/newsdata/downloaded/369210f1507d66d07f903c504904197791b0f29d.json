The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 34 points or 0.4% at 8,027.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nOn Tuesday House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry (link)into Trump after reports the president may have withheld Congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine while pressing Ukraine's president to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden and his son.\n\nWednesday morning the White House (link)published a memorandum of a phone call (link) between Trump and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asks Zelensky to \"look into\" former vice-president Biden and his son Hunter who had business dealings in Ukraine, but the 25 minute call did not mention military aid to the country.\n\nAnalysts said the inquiry is a potential drag for stocks, though the potential may be limited barring an indication that support for Trump is slipping in the Republican-controlled Senate. A vote by the House to impeach would be followed by a trial in the Senate, which would decide the president's fate.\n\nRead:Why Trump impeachment threat is rattling stock-market investors -- at least for now (link)\n\n\"Given how this increases the prospect of heightened political uncertainty in the world's largest economy and compounds the list of geopolitical factors, risk assets and global equities in particular remain in the firing line,\" said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM, in a note.\n\nThe sudden rise in political risk in Washington comes as economic data deteriorates globally, adding a fresh complication for investors trying to decide whether central banks will be able to shore up growth. Analysts questioned, however, whether the impeachment cloud would have a lasting effect on stocks.\n\nSee:How Pelosi's impeachment inquiry into Trump could be a plus for one stock sector (link)\n\n\"We would note that this is only a small step on the road to impeachment, which would ultimately require a 2/3 majority in the Republican-controlled Senate and that it is not clear yet whether the House will vote to endorse the inquiry, so leading to charges against Trump,\" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in a note. Trump only mentioned Biden once in the July 25 call which lasted about 30 minutes and produced a five-page transcript.\n\nOther factors weighing on markets include the ongoing uncertainty around U.S.-China trade. China reportedly is buying more pork from the U.S (link)., partly due to African swine fever which has afflicted the Chinese herd and Trump told reporters Wednesday (link)that a U.S.-China deal could come sooner \"than you think\", helping to support stocks\n\nIn other news Wednesday, U.S. August home sales rose 7.1% (link) to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713,000 which was just shy of the 12-year high set in June, and were up 18% year-on-year.\n\nChicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans said on Wednesday (link) (link)he backed the Fed's two recent interest rate cuts but feels the central bank is now \"well-positioned\" to see how economic data evolves. Other Federal Reserve speakers Wednesday include Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Fed governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.\n\nWhich stocks are worth watching?\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (PM) and Altria Group Inc.(MO) surprised the market early Wednesday with the news that they are ending their merger talks (link)and will instead focus on launching a smokeless tobacco product in the U.S. Shares of Philip Morris were up 5%, those for Altria were off 0.1%.\n\nShares of Nike Inc.(NKE) were up 5.4% as the apparel and footwear maker on Tuesday reported first-quarter earnings and sales that topped Wall Street expectations (link), including a jump in China.\n\nBest Buy Co. Inc.(BBY) on Wednesday unveiled financial targets (link), including $1 billion in additional cost reductions and annual enterprise revenue of $50 billion by 2025. Its shares were down 0.2%.\n\nHow are other markets performing?\n\nU.S. Treasury yields rose on Wednesday as inflows into haven assets took a breather, following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to move ahead with impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump on Tuesday. The 10-year Treasury note yield was up 1.4 basis points to 1.649%.\n\nGold prices declined on Wednesday, pressured by strength in the dollar and a climb in U.S. benchmark stock indexes as the market weighed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to launch a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Gold for December on Comex dropped $26.90, or 1.8%, to $1,512.50 an ounce, after it finished at its highest on Tuesday for a most-active contract since Sept. 4, according to FactSet data. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index traded up by 0.7%.\n\nOil futures fell Wednesday as U.S. government data revealed a second weekly climb in domestic crude inventories. Also weighing on prices were news reports saying Saudi Arabia had restored most of crude production capacity, recovering from attacks on its facilities earlier this month. West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery fell $1.01, or 1.8%, to $56.27 a barrel, while November Brent crude , the global benchmark, was off $1.38, or 2.2%, at $61.725 a barrel.\n\nIn Asia overnight Wednesday, the China CSI 300 was little changed around 3,870 while Japan's Nikkei 225 index was also steady at 22,020.\n\nIn Europe, the mood was more dour.
