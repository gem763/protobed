Last year, a record 4.4 billion flights departed, according to Iata research.\n\nMr de Juniac also called into question the environment taxes that \u201cpenalise airlines and air travellers but do little to support industry efforts to become greener\u201d.\n\n\u201cRaising airline costs reduces the industry\u2019s ability to invest in more efficient aircraft and ground equipment. And I have yet to see any aviation environmental tax actually being used to help reduce aviation\u2019s environmental impacts,\u201d he said.\n\nIn July, France announced an \u201ceco-tax\u201d of up to \u20ac18 that would be added to all flight tickets from 2020.\n\nIata has committed to capping emissions from aviation from 2020, and cutting them to half of 2005 levels by 2050.\n\nMr de Juniac also spoke about the role of sustainable aviation fuel and electric aircraft, which would require \u201cgovernments to support these efforts, not make them more difficult\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, capacity also plays a role in sustainable travel, said Mr de Juniac, especially in cities such as New York, London and Amsterdam which have \u201ccritically congested airports\u201d.\n\nFor example, in Europe, aircraft bottlenecks on the ground and in the air can cause excess fuel burn and CO2 emissions. Last year, says Iata, aircraft in Europe were delayed by 19.1 million minutes, which made up 5.6 per cent of the continent\u2019s annual carbon footprint.", "description": "The flight shaming campaign is\u00a0giving passengers a \u201cfalse choice\u201d, according to the director general of the international aviation regulator.
