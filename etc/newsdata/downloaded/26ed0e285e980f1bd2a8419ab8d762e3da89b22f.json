Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Thursday. \u201cI made umpteen speeches here at this chair, and the Republican leader denied the need. But now, thank God, he has seen the light. We need more money for election security; ask election officials, Democrat or Republican, throughout the country.\u201d\n\nMcConnell spokesman Doug Andres said Schumer was mischaracterizing the Republican leader\u2019s position and maintained that the amendment was \u201creally a continuation of previous years\u2019 funding.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee agreed by bipartisan voice vote Thursday to add the $250 million for election security grants to a spending bill covering financial services and general government operations.\n\nA final figure would have to be negotiated with the House, which has approved $600 million, and the compromise legislation would have to be passed by both chambers.\n\nIn August 2018, Senate Republicans voted down an effort to direct an extra $250 million toward election security ahead of the midterms. At the time, only one Republican, Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), voted for the additional funds.\n\nSenate Republicans, including McConnell, have also blocked numerous Democratic efforts to bring election security legislation to the floor, including measures that would have authorized funding to update voting equipment. Congress did not agree to any election security spending in fiscal 2019.\n\nMcConnell has defended Republican moves to block the bills by arguing that Congress and the Trump administration have already taken steps to combat foreign interference. Last year, for instance, Congress approved $380 million to improve election security systems. The Senate also passed legislation to bar people who have interfered with U.S. elections from obtaining visas to enter the United States.\n\n[McConnell defends blocking election security bill, rejects criticism he is aiding Russia]\n\nAndres disputed the notion that Thursday\u2019s statement represented a turnaround, arguing that McConnell\u2019s approach has been consistent in providing funding to the states through the appropriations process.\n\nThe House-passed legislation, he added, has \u201cstrings attached\u201d to its funding and is an \u201celection reform bill designed to look like election security.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former Trump administration officials have continued to sound the alarm that more needs to be done: In his testimony before Congress in July, former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III warned that foreign election interference efforts were happening \u201cas we sit\u201d in the hearing rooms.\n\nOn Thursday, Schumer touched on those exhortations, noting that lawmakers \u201chave been warned time and again by our national security leaders \u2014 nearly all of them Republicans appointed by President Trump \u2014 that China and, of course, Russia are potential threats in 2020.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee echoed Schumer\u2019s remarks, arguing that the funds are critical to national security.\n\n\u201cWe know that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election, targeted our election infrastructure. . . . This problem was not isolated to 2016, and we cannot be complacent now,\u201d said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the top Democrat on the panel, which is led by Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.).\n\n[The Cybersecurity 202: Democrats launch \u2018full-court press\u2019 on election security]\n\nEric Rosenbach, a former Pentagon chief of staff who directs Harvard University\u2019s Defending Digital Democracy program, also praised the turnaround from McConnell, saying the initial funding was insufficient to arm states against possible intrusions from nation-state actors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign that even Mitch McConnell believes this is a serious issue,\u201d Rosenbach said in an interview, attributing the move less to pressure from Democratic lawmakers than to what he described as the plain fact that the nation\u2019s election infrastructure is insufficiently resilient. \u201cEven McConnell needs to set politics aside and do what\u2019s right for the country.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, meanwhile, argued that the Trump administration \u201chas made enormous strides to help states secure their elections without giving Washington new power to push the states around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we continued the progress we saw in 2018, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said in his floor remarks. \u201cThis is exactly the kind of positive outcome that is possible when we stop posturing for the press and let Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy conduct a bipartisan committee process.\u201d\n\nSen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) offered a note of caution, noting that much of the money provided to states in 2018 remains unspent and arguing that more oversight is needed. \u201cWe\u2019re just handing states money, and they\u2019re glad to take it, but we\u2019re not even requiring they spend it at this point,\u201d said Lankford, who sits on the Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe money that was allocated in spring 2018 has all been distributed to the states, which were given five years to spend it, according to Thomas Hicks, head of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\n\u201cMost of them have spent it on cybersecurity and new voting equipment, and we need more,\u201d Hicks said Tuesday at a symposium hosted by the Federal Election Commission on the topic of digital disinformation and threats to democracy.\n\nIsaac Stanley-Becker and Paul Kane contributed to this report.", "description": "Thursday\u2019s announcement follows more than a year of opposition by Senate Republicans on the issue.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Erica Werner", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On Economic Policy", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/91aD_x6--WVH6Dlfw3GRyA7aC88=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IADAS4G2JAI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
