(AP) - Cameron Rosendahl threw two second-half touchdown passes to Steven Newbold as Tennessee State scored the final 17 points and the Tigers beat Austin Peay 26-24 on Saturday to snap a six-game skid.\n\nRosendahl was 22-of-39 passing for 220 yards, Chris Rowland had 12 receptions for 113 yards and Antonio Zita made field goals of 43, 22, 36 and a career-longest 50 yards for Tennessee State. Rowland has 82 receptions this season, a program record.\n\nNewbold\u2019s 8-yard touchdown catch gave the Tigers (2-6, 1-3 Ohio Valley Conference) their first lead and capped the scoring with 7:56 to play.\n\nOn the next play from scrimmage, JaVaughn Craig hit DeAngelo Wilson for a 53-yard gain to the TSU 22 but the drive stalled and Logan Birchfield\u2019s 34-yard field-goal attempt missed wide left less than 90 seconds later. Tennessee State went three-and-out on its ensuing drive and, after a short punt, the Governors (4-3, 2-1) took over near midfield but five plays later Josh Green intercepted a pass from Craig in the end zone.\n\nThe Tigers again went three-and-out and Wilson returned the punt 27 yards to the TSU 48 with 2:36 left. Austin Peay quickly moved to the 21, setting up a 32-yard field-goal attempt by Birchfield with 1:07 to go that was, again, wide left.\n\nThe Governor went into the game ranked No. 19 in the FCS Coaches poll after consecutive wins over then-No. 11 Jacksonville State and then-No. 20 Southeast Missouri.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cameron Rosendahl threw two second-half touchdown passes to Steven Newbold as Tennessee State scored the final 17 points and the Tigers beat Austin Peay 26-24 on Saturday to snap a six-game skid.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
