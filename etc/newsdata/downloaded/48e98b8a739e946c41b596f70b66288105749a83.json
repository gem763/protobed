One of the most enigmatic footballers on the planet, Mario Balotelli returned home this summer as he joined newly-promoted Brescia on a free transfer.\n\nNow 29, Balotelli continues to fill news pages with his series of bizarre, sometimes outrageous, actions. Only this weekend, he destroyed a pitch-side camera belonging to a Brescia photographer, who is now set to sue the club for damages.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the once-lethal Italy international comes up against Inter Milan, the club where his misdemeanours began a decade ago. Since, he's been to England, AC Milan, back to England, back to AC Milan and had two stints in France - amid it all, are Balotelli's best days now behind him?\n\nThe enigma of Mario Balotelli has moved on to club number eight, newly-promoted Brescia\n\nDelving into the past therefore, as you examine the past 10 years, the manner in which the Mario Balotelli story has developed is pretty astounding.\n\nSigned at 16 years of age by one of Italy's most successful clubs, he was thrust into the public limelight during Jose Mourinho's two-year tenure at the club.\n\nHe faced heavy criticism for a number of discrepancies, including wearing a shirt of rivals AC Milan on national television, and his reputation with Inter fans was irreparable after he threw his shirt down on the pitch after a Champions League game against Barcelona.\n\nMario Balotelli argues with fans after receiving a chorus of boos from the Inter faithful in 2010\n\nOne of his most iconic career moments saw him reveal a 'Why always me?' shirt at Old Trafford\n\nSome of the headlines were not of his own doing - he was the subject of disgraceful bouts of racism during those early years in Serie A, particularly from Juventus supporters.\n\nIn the end, despite picking up winners medals in Inter's famous treble-winning campaign in 2010, a fresh change, and challenge, was needed.\n\nEnter Manchester City and Roberto Mancini, who gave him his debut at Inter in 2007.\n\nMARIO BALOTELLI'S CAREER 2006-07: Lumezzane - 2 games, 0 goals 2007-10: Inter - 86 games, 28 goals 2010-13: Man City - 80 games, 30 goals 2013-14: AC Milan - 54 games, 30 goals 2014-16: Liverpool - 28 games, 4 goals 2015-16: AC Milan (loan) - 23 games, 3 goals 2016-19: Nice - 76 games, 43 goals 2019: Marseille - 15 games, 8 goals 2019\u2013present: Brescia - 4 games, 1 goal\n\nOften remembered on these shores for his peculiar off-the-field antics, Balotelli's time on the pitch at the Etihad was forgetfully fruitful. He played a part in City's first trophy in 35 years with the 2011 FA Cup, and a double in City's 6-1 thrashing of United at Old Trafford was particularly memorable for Balotelli's 'Why always me?' t-shirt celebration.\n\nHe also contributed to the most extraordinary moment in Premier League history - Sergio Aguero's last-minute title-winner on the final day of the 2011-12 season against QPR was assisted by Balotelli, a substitute on the day.\n\nPerhaps inevitably though, he fell out with Mancini - again, and again, and again - and was eventually allowed to depart to Inter's rivals AC Milan in January 2013.\n\nAfter the best goalscoring period of his career at Milan, a return to England was swift, and prompted the beginning of a rapid downfall.\n\nBrendan Rodgers' gamble to replace top-scorer Luis Suarez with Balotelli at Liverpool backfired to great lengths. One goal in 16 Premier League appearances, and the Italian returned to Milan in a heartbeat.\n\nRelatively successful stints - in terms of goals - at Nice and Marseille followed, but he is yet to find a club which caters for the mysterious world of Mario.\n\nCould that be about to change though? Back at hometown Brescia, after owner Massimo Cellino tore up the wage structure to sign him, Balotelli admitted he is in as good a shape as his Manchester City stint.\n\nMario has lunch with his mother regularly, and seems genuinely determined to immerse himself in Brescia's quest for survival, fighting for a team at the opposite end of the table than he is previously accustomed to.\n\nThere is no doubt that the forward could well have wasted his best days. But, as opposed to many players who struggle with fitness as they get older, you sense with Balotelli the battle has always been mental.\n\nSigns of maturity are now present, albeit sporadically. And put simply, if he can't make it work now, where the circumstances are near-perfect, he never will.\n\nBalotelli scored his first goal for Brescia in a 2-1 defeat to Napoli at the end of last month\n\nBalotelli melted many hearts when he walked out with his daughter Pia, 6, prior to the game\n\nIs a renaissance of the maverick on the cards then? That's down to no one else but the man himself. Balotelli has ambitiously targetted a recall to the national team for Euro 2020, with none other than Mancini at the helm.\n\nHe has some way to go to add to those 36 caps, but should he save Brescia from the drop with a bag of goals and a more workmanlike approach to this football career, the enigma could make a return on the biggest stage at next summer's major tournament.\n\nHis transgressions may never stop, but Mario may have just found a place where he can save his career. A place he can finally call home. Mainly, because it is indeed his home.", "description": "KIERAN JACKSON: On Tuesday evening, the once-lethal Italy international comes up against Inter Milan, the club where his misdemeanours began a decade ago.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/22/20303098-0-image-a-8_1572303591492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
