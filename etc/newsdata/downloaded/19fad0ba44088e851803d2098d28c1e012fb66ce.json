Despite the camp d\u00e9cor, the Botanist advertises himself as \u201cstraight-acting\u201d on his online profile, which piques the interest of Jones, then a student at Western Kentucky University. They agree to meet for some meaningless sex, the kind that is scorched with meaning.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Jones\u2019s first rodeo. After growing up believing that \u201cbeing a black gay boy is a death wish,\u201d he takes to openly gay collegiate life with a \u201cferocity\u201d that alarms his college friends. Jones finds \u201cpower in being a spectacle, even a miserable spectacle,\u201d and sex with strangers \u2014 \u201cI buried myself in the bodies of other men,\u201d he writes \u2014 becomes a sport at which he would surely win championships. Each man offers Jones a chance at validation and reinvention. There are countless roles to play: a college athlete, a preacher\u2019s son, a high school crush finally willing to reciprocate.\n\nWhen the Botanist asks Jones his name, he lies and says \u201cCody.\u201d It\u2019s a psychologically salient deception. Cody was the name of the first straight boy Jones ever coveted, and also the first one to call him a \u201cfaggot.\u201d Jones was 12 when that happened, and he didn\u2019t take the insult lightly. He beat his fists against a door that separated him from the slender, acne-covered boy who held so much power over him, until he couldn\u2019t feel his hands anymore. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d been split open,\u201d Jones writes. Still, the insult was \u201calmost a relief: Someone had finally said it.\u201d\n\nLike many gay boys before him, Jones eroticized his shame. He dreamed about Cody insulting him as the boy undressed. \u201c\u2018Faggot\u2019 swallowed him whole and spit him back out as a wet dream,\u201d Jones writes, one of countless sentences in a moving and bracingly honest memoir that reads like fevered poetry.", "description": "In \u201cHow We Fight for Our Lives,\u201d the poet Saeed Jones recalls a coming-of-age marked by sexual violence and bigotry as well as tenderness.", "authors": ["Benoit Denizet-Lewis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/12/books/review/Denizet-Lewis1/Denizet-Lewis1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
