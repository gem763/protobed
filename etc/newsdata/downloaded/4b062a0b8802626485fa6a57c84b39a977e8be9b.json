Did I think Donald Trump would be reelected.\n\nYes, I said. His supporters are rabid, no matter what he says or does. We\u2019re looking at a trillion-dollar deficit, and the GOP \u2014 the party of fiscal conservatism \u2014 just shrugs. Consumer prices are rising because of tariffs and a recession is feared, but Trump\u2019s populist supporters don\u2019t mind.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get the promised cheaper and better healthcare. The national infrastructure program never happened. The party of family values adores a man who has mocked women\u2019s looks and lied about secret payments to a Playboy bunny, and the days of GOP hatred of commies is officially over, because Russia helped elect Trump.\n\nYet for all that, the GOP \u2014 or roughly 90% of it, according to polls \u2014 is standing by its man. That\u2019s partly because of who Trump is, but largely because of what he isn\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Democrat.\n\nThe Dems, meanwhile, don\u2019t have a single candidate who\u2019s caught fire. It\u2019s early, and maybe it\u2019ll still happen. But if the nominee is on the left \u2014 Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, for instance \u2014 it could turn off moderate voters. And if the nominee is more centrist \u2014 Joe Biden, for instance \u2014 millennials and minorities might sit out the election.\n\nMr. Tolliver didn\u2019t argue those points. He said he wasn\u2019t wild about any of the options, and his customers aren\u2019t either.\n\n\u201cOther than \u2018beat Trump,\u2019 \u201d said Tolliver, there\u2019s no consensus.\n\nLawrence Tolliver works on a customer at his barbershop in South Los Angeles. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vast majority of his customers are African American, but Mr. Tolliver says Cory Booker is getting lukewarm response.\n\n\u201cSome people like him, some people don\u2019t,\u201d said Tolliver.\n\nWilliam Taylor, 71, told me he liked Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, but can either of them beat Trump? He\u2019s not sure and neither am I, despite the fact that some polls have shown Biden taking the president down.\n\nTo be fair, my opinion may be worth less than a Michael Dukakis for President button, but I can think of only one person who would beat Trump, hands-down, no problem.\n\n\u201cMichelle Obama,\u201d I said.\n\nLawrence Tolliver cuts the hair of Arthur Gomez, 26, under a framed portrait of former First Lady Michelle Obama. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nFinally, we had a consensus. Tolliver, Ella Brown, Yusef Mohammad, Taylor and Lawrence Walker, who was in the chair for a trim, all agreed: Of course Michelle could take Trump. And as if even she was down with the idea, there she was, on a poster on the barbershop wall, flexing her bicep like she was preparing for a knockout punch.\n\n\u201cYes We Can!\u201d said the poster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI bought that at the African American Museum,\u201d said Mr. Tolliver.\n\nThere is, however, one problem Michelle Obama fans are going to have to deal with, and it\u2019s a big one.\n\nShe ain\u2019t interested.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s zero chance,\u201d she told the National, an Amtrak magazine. And in an interview with Conan O\u2019Brien, she said being in the White House and under the spotlight for eight years was enough, and \u201cI\u2019m not interested in politics.\u201d\n\nI understand and respect that. But we can hold out hope, can\u2019t we? No offense to Amtrak and Conan O\u2019Brien, but unless and until Michele Obama tells it to a higher authority \u2014 like Ellen DeGeneres \u2014 the dream is alive.\n\nLawrence Tolliver poses with customers Yusuf Muhammad, 73, from left; Arthur Gomez, 26; William Taylor, 71; and Lawrence Rogers, 73. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nA Michelle Obama-Donald Trump showdown would be glorious, even though it could get ugly. And it\u2019s shocking to think about how we\u2019ve regressed since Nov. 5, 2008, when I walked with Tolliver, his wife, Bernadette, their sons Aaron and Bernard and daughter Alexandra to McCarty Memorial Church, where they voted for Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day,\u201d Mr. Tolliver said then. \u201cGlory, Hallelujah!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast forward \u2014 or backward, depending on how you look at it \u2014 and we\u2019ve got a president who for no good reason has insulted the intelligence of African Americans LeBron James, Don Lemon and Maxine Waters. He\u2019s belittled football players for taking a social stand and he tweeted a mocking \u201ctoo bad\u201d when the Baltimore home of U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings was burglarized.\n\n\u201cI know her name has been coming up, and I think absolutely Michelle Obama would be a great choice if she would run,\u201d said Michael Williams, 66, a retired L.A. County medical technician who got a haircut at Tolliver\u2019s on Friday morning. \u201cI think she appeals to most of the country and I think it would energize the Democratic Party and our younger folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would beat the pants off of Trump,\u201d said Taylor, who\u2019s in the moving and storage business. He noted that images of Michelle were on all four walls at Tolliver\u2019s.\n\n\u201cShe has the support of the shop,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nDo you hear this, Michelle?\n\nWilliams told me there were things he liked about four of the Democrats \u2014 Biden, Warren, Sanders and Booker. And he\u2019s leaning toward Biden, but told me his son sees things a little differently.\n\nThere you go. That\u2019s one of the Democratic Party\u2019s gut-wrenching dilemmas.\n\n\u201cI think Biden would have the worst chance of winning,\u201d said Michael Williams Jr., 32, an account manager at Pandora, the internet music site.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a minority and I\u2019m a millennial and we definitely don\u2019t come out to vote as much as my dad\u2019s generation,\u201d said the son, who doesn\u2019t think Biden would change that. But he thinks \u201ca true progressive\u201d like Warren or Sanders would get him and a lot of his contemporaries excited.\n\nWilliams Jr. said he planned to vote for Warren in the primary, but if she goes down, he\u2019ll vote for whoever wins the Democratic nomination. You can call Trump racist or mysogynist, Williams Jr. said, but he just thinks of the president as a dim bulb who\u2019s not curious enough to educate himself on matters of critical importance.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s just a bad person.\u201d\n\nAs for Michelle Obama, Williams Jr. said, \u201cOur generation looks at her and President Obama lovingly, and I think she would inspire minorities.\u201d\n\nYoung people would flock to the polls. People of color would be in lockstep. And women would turn out in droves. Even the father and son Williams would be on the same side.\n\nThe more Tolliver thought about it, the more excited he became. This country is headed for the rocks, he said. Only one person can save us and silence Trump.\n\nI don\u2019t know about that last part.\n\nIt\u2019s a longshot, sure, but the very idea of Michelle as a candidate would give Trump fits.\n\nI nominated Michael Williams Sr. to be director of the Barbershop Committee to Draft Michelle Obama.\n\nHe accepted.\n\nPoliticians have been known to drop by Tolliver\u2019s, and Williams Sr. knows what he\u2019d say to her.\n\n\u201cI would say, \u2018For the sake of the country, we need you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHallelujah!", "description": "Who can beat Trump?
