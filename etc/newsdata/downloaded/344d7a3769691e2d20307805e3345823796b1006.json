The last time a change in the metric was deemed statistically significant was when it grew from 2012-2013.\n\nWhile many states didn't see a change in income inequality last year, the income gap grew wider in nine states: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Virginia.\n\nThe disparity grew despite a surging national economy that has seen low unemployment and more than 10 years of consecutive GDP growth.\n\nThe most troubling thing about the new report, says William M. Rodgers III, a professor of public policy and chief economist at the Heldrich Center at Rutgers University, is that it \"clearly illustrates the inability of the current economic expansion, the longest on record, to lessen inequality.\"\n\nWhen asked why the rising economic tide has raised some boats more than others, Rodgers lists several factors, including the decline of organized labor and competition for jobs from abroad. He also cites tax policies that favor businesses and higher-income families.\n\nIncome inequality is measured through the Gini index, which measures how far apart incomes are from each other. To do that, the index assigns a hypothetical score of 0.0 to a population in which incomes are distributed perfectly evenly and a score of 1.0 to a population where only one household gets all of the income.\n\nIn the U.S., the Gini index figure had been holding steady for the past several years. But it moved from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 in 2018. While that change may seem small, it's statistically significant, the Census Bureau says. The agency notes that back in 2006, the figure stood at 0.464.\n\nThe Census Bureau says five states \u2014 California, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana and New York \u2014 and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico had higher inequality rates than the rest of the U.S. in 2018. Of that group, California is the only state that saw its income gap grow even wider last year.\n\nU.S. median household income has never been higher, coming in at $61,937 for 2018, the Census Bureau says. But in 29 states and Puerto Rico, the median household income was lower than the national level.\n\nThe report reflects some positive changes for the nation's poverty rate, which fell in 14 states and Puerto Rico. And in four states \u2014 California, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina \u2014 the poverty rates dropped for the fifth consecutive year.\n\nPoverty rates did not grow worse in the 25 largest U.S. cities in 2018, the Census Bureau says. And in seven of those metropolitan areas, it fell.\n\nIn some cases, Rodgers says, the reason the poverty rate fell is likely due to a growing number of local and state governments that have raised their minimum wage \u2014 something the federal government hasn't done since 2009.\n\nIn the three most populous U.S. metropolitan areas \u2014 centered on New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 the percentage of people in poverty fell for the fourth year in a row.", "description": "The gap between the richest and the poorest U.S. households is now the largest it's been in the past 50 years, the U.S. Census Bureau says.", "authors": ["Bill Chappell"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/26/gettyimages-511273938_wide-22d6e91bfbb0d8bd64c6648a887d81993485c468.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
