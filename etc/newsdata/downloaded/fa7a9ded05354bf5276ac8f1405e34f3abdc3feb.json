The last time the Commons sat on a Saturday, after Argentina invaded the Falklands Islands in 1982, it was a moment of high drama. I was covering the debate as a rookie political correspondent, three months after moving to Westminster.\n\nMy abiding memory of the day is an unlikely speech backing an unlikely war by Michael Foot, the Labour leader, CND stalwart and self-described \u201cinveterate peacemonger.\u201d Tory MPs hailed it as the speech of a lifetime by one of the last great parliamentary orators. His fellow anti-war left-wingers were less impressed; Jeremy Corbyn, who didn\u2019t enter the Commons until the following year, believes Britain has not fought a just war since 1939-45.\n\nMy other memory is Margaret Thatcher shuffling nervously on the government front bench. She had authorised a risky military operation almost 8,000 miles away and nobody knew how it would end. The spectre of another rare Saturday debate \u2013 on the 1956 Suez Crisis \u2013 hung over the debate. Thatcher was no Iron Lady that day. But after the Falklands were recaptured, she was. The postscript was a landslide Tory election victory a year later, her second win of three, and Foot\u2019s resignation after a disastrous campaign.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It was also a high point for parliament.\n\nToday, Boris Johnson appealed for unity among MPs and the country \u2013 on his terms, as ever \u2013 and even made a rare mention of the 48 per cent. But, with hundreds of thousands of people on the Final Say march heading towards Westminster, it was clear that both parliament and the country remained as split down the middle as they were in 2016.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

EPA\n\nJohnson\u2019s tone was more statesmanlike than usual; perhaps he has learned from his intemperate dismissal of female MPs\u2019 fears of threats of violence against them. But he still fell short of matching his hero Winston Churchill.\n\nParliament\u2019s reputation has fallen dramatically since 1892. The scandal over MPs\u2019 expenses was rightly exposed in 2009, but the image of politicians has not recovered since. Their actions have not always helped to rebuild it, nor has the coverage of politics by some national newspapers, or, more recently, the toxic political \u201cdebate\u201d on social media.\n\nWhile the 1982 debate ended on a high, today\u2019s was an anti-climax. What Johnson wanted to be the crucial vote on his Brexit deal fizzled out when MPs approved Sir Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment withholding approval for the deal until the Bill implementing it has become law. The big vote on his Brexit deal is now likely to be held on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nThe anger and frustration among Johnson allies and Brexiteer MPs was palpable. They argued that the country would not understand yet another Brexit delay, claiming it would further damage parliament\u2019s reputation. After his defeat, Johnson argued that delay would be \u201cbad for democracy.\u201d Of course, this fits Johnson\u2019s \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d narrative for the general election he intends to fight \u2013 either to cash in a reward for \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d if the Bill implementing the deal becomes is passed, or seeking a mandate for his deal if it is not.\n\nLike Donald Trump, Johnson can always blame someone else for his own failures. If the Bill does not become law by 31 October, which looks a very tall order now, Johnson will again try to turn people against parliament to distract attention for not meeting his \u201cdo-or-die\u201d pledge to take the UK out of the EU by then.\n\nThere is another, more truthful narrative: MPs are doing the job we sent them to Westminster to do. There is a collision between the direct democracy of the 2016 referendum and parliament\u2019s role in interpreting it, and MPs' reluctance to approve an act of economic self-harm\n\nMPs were right to back Letwin\u2019s move. It finally buries the prospect of a no-deal exit on 31 October. It will ensure, and provide enough time for, proper scrutiny of Johnson\u2019s last-minute deal instead of bouncing MPs into a rushed take-it-or-leave it decision.\n\nIt is Johnson, not MPs, who prolongs the divisions he says he wants to heal, and who further tarnishes the image of our parliament and politicians with his never-ending blame game.\n\nI hope that, one day, our parliament will recover to the high it was at when I first came in to witness and report on it. But I doubt it will.", "description": "What a contrast. The last time the Commons sat on a Saturday, after Argentina invaded the Falklands Islands in 1982, it was a moment of high drama.
