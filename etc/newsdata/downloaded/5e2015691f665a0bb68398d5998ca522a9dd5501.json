(https://bit.ly/2lV3sAU)\n\nPeloton said it plans to use funds from the offering to run its operations, invest in marketing and acquire new technologies.\n\nFor the year ended June 30, Peloton's revenue more than doubled to $915 million. However, its net loss widened to $195.6 million from $47.9 million a year earlier.\n\nThe company's flotation comes on the heels of the stock market debut of teeth alignment firm SmileDirectClub Inc , which priced shares above its target range, but underwhelmed investors who punished the stock.\n\nFounded in 2012, Peloton sells indoor bicycles and offers packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home.\n\nThe company was most recently valued at $4.15 billion, according to data provider PitchBook.\n\nRide-hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc also went public earlier this year with high expectations, but their shares have tumbled since then, after investor concerns over their steep losses.\n\nGoldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch and Barclays are the lead underwriters for the Peloton IPO.
