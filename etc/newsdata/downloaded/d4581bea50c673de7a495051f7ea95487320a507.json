At U.N., Trump calls him \u2018a great leader.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "When asked Monday whether he was concerned about the anti-Sissi demonstrations, Trump shrugged the suggestion aside.\n\n\u201cDemonstrations? No, everybody has demonstrations,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of the U.N. gathering. \u201cEgypt has a great leader. He\u2019s highly respected; he\u2019s brought order. Before he was here, there was very little order. There was chaos. So I\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d\n\nSince Sissi assumed power after a 2013 military coup he engineered, tens of thousands of people have been arrested, with some of them tortured, according to extensive documentation by human rights groups. Last year, Amnesty International said Sissi\u2019s crackdown on journalists and critics had turned Egypt into an \u201copen-air prison.\u201d\n\nThis month, a group of human rights organizations called on members of the European Union to review allegations of widespread abuse in Egypt, claiming that \u201chuman rights violations have increased sharply\u201d in recent years.\n\nBut Trump has consistently praised Sissi in public, while apparently celebrating the Egyptian president\u2019s authoritarian rule in private.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported this month that while waiting for Sissi at the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, in August, Trump was overheard calling out, \u201cWhere\u2019s my favorite dictator?\u201d\n\nAnd when Sissi visited Washington in April, Trump said the Egyptian leader was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d and is a \u201cgreat president.\u201d In the same visit, Sissi said U.S.-Egypt relations \u201chave not been better.\u201d\n\nTrump and Sissi\u2019s meeting Monday came just days after viral videos from a former government contractor alleging Sissi was complicit in a large-scale corruption scandal provoked protests in Egypt. People took to the streets in Cairo and elsewhere Friday, chanting, \u201cRise up, fear not, Sissi must go.\u201d The protests were relatively small but significant because such concerted public displays against Sissi are rare.\n\nHuman rights advocates in Egypt have warned that a crackdown is underway and that the hundreds of protesters detained over the weekend face charges of spreading fake news and belonging to terrorist organizations.\n\nOn Monday, New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger drew further attention to Trump\u2019s relationship with the Egyptian government. In an op-ed about threats to press freedom worldwide, Sulzberger described a 2017 incident in which a Trump administration official warned the newspaper that Egyptian authorities planned to arrest Declan Walsh, the Times\u2019s bureau chief in Cairo.\n\nThe official expressed to the Times that the Trump administration \u201cintended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out,\u201d Sulzberger wrote. The official risked their career to inform the newspaper of the threat. Walsh, who is Irish, then sought help from the Irish Embassy to leave Egypt.\n\nMichele Dunne, director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said she was concerned that Trump\u2019s recent rhetoric on Egypt could be interpreted as an endorsement of Sissi\u2019s crackdown.\n\n\u201cThe United States can\u2019t control what Sissi does or what happens inside of Egypt, but it can control the stance that the U.S. government takes on this,\u201d Dunne said. Washington should explicitly stand up for the right to peacefully protest, she said, in part so \u201cit\u2019s clear that whatever the Egyptians do, they didn\u2019t do with a green light from Washington.\u201d\n\nDunne said Trump sees Sissi as a strategically important partner in the fight against extremism. But what he fails to see, she said, is that Sissi\u2019s \u201crepression is, in fact, fostering radicalization of Egyptian youth and that human rights abuses have serious negative consequences for the fight against extremism and terrorism.\u201d\n\nJon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Trump may be personally drawn to Sissi in part because the Egyptian leader doesn\u2019t shy from confronting his opposition and also likes to align himself with leaders who take the same approach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure President Sissi lavishly praises President Trump, and I\u2019m sure that helps reinforce their relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nAlterman noted that this is a \u201cdangerous moment\u201d for Sissi, given the crisis at home. But he probably sees his preplanned U.N. trip as an opportunity to garner points on the world stage.\n\nSissi\u2019s U.N. visit \u201cis portrayed in Egypt as a sign that Egypt is one of the most important and powerful countries in the world and that the world wants to meet President Sissi,\u201d Alterman said.\n\nRead more:\n\nEgypt protests over viral videos alleging taxpayer funds stolen to build lavish hotel and palace\n\nEgypt broadens crackdown on anti-government protesters, arresting hundreds\n\nEgypt jails American traveler, saying she criticized the government on Facebook", "description": "Trump has repeatedly lavished praise on the Egyptian president, even as human rights groups accuse Sissi of overseeing a harsh crackdown.", "authors": ["Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Staff Writer", "Foreign Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/H-CR0Q4hxQXtDziXCMDOScqt8Hk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5XZFZ6W6IQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
