The day before, an emotional speech had been given by Republican representative Mark Meadows, who paused tearfully during a eulogy in which he referred to Cummings as a \"dear friend\" he shared \"intimate secrets\" with, and \"a man we all will miss\". The Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also eulogized Cummings on Thursday, remembering his part in helping to mediate protests after the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died in police custody in 2015.\n\nIt was a moment of bipartisanship in a country which stands divided -- and it was unapologetically political. Elijah Cummings' wife Dr Maya Rockeymoore-Cummings, dressed in white, reminded those gathered that the last few months of her husband's life had been made \"infinitely more difficult\" because of \"personal attacks\". She was quite plainly referring to the online commentary of President Donald Trump, who tweeted during the summer that \"Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men and women of Border Patrol about conditions at the southern border when his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the worst in the USA\", following up with the accusation that Baltimore was a \"disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Clinton shakes hands with Congressional staff member Harry Spikes as Barack Obama and Maya Rockeymoore look on at the funeral of her husband Elijah Cummings (REUTERS) More\n\nCummings had plenty of reason to be angry with Republicans, and his family and friends had plenty of reason to be angry on his behalf. He may well have embraced his Republican counterparts and overlooked their support for Donald Trump, but it seemed one pallbearer couldn't quite bring himself to do the same at the memorial yesterday, as he seemingly refused to shake the hand of Mitch McConnell, passing him over in a handshake line and instead going straight to Nancy Pelosi. McConnell's perturbed face began circulating on social media almost immediately, accompanied by celebratory tweets.\n\nHillary Clinton's speech was similarly damning (if one is allowed use the word for a ceremony held in a church.) Using the classic hand gestures of her 2016 campaign -- OK-sign-pointing and hand-to-heart pauses -- she said, to applause, \"Like the Old Testament prophet, [Elijah] stood against corrupt leadership\". Women in the audience smiled and nodded, and one snapped a picture of the former presidential candidate on her smartphone. It's no secret that Cummings was heavily involved in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nBill Clinton, his voice slightly croaky and his age more obvious than last time we saw him in public, pointed to the casket and said, in that free-wheeling, ebullient way he always does, \"I love this man. I loved every minute I spent with him.\" He continued, more sombre: \"We should hear him now in the quiet times at night and in the morning when we need courage.\"\n\nOutside of the heartfelt speeches made by family members, the most emotional moment of the day came courtesy of Barack Obama.", "description": "The great and the good came out for Elijah Cummings' funeral today, where the former Maryland representative was laid to rest after having become the first black lawmaker to lie in state at the Capitol.Former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton", "authors": ["Holly Baxter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xgIkCjHfo.tx3kYGJDllKg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/096c3472beebf0126a943e83628e8fcf", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
