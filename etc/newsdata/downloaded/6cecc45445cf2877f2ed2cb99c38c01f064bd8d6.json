As long as he is in charge of the players coming in, I don't see a problem.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"We hope it goes to back challenging for titles and Champions Leagues. When you look five or six years ago when Alex left, the other person who didn't get the credit he deserved was David Gill. He was a football man and he knew footballers.\n\n\"From the day he and Sir Alex left, it has been difficult.\n\n\"I think the alarm bells rang straight away when David (Moyes) took over and signed Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini for \u00a370m.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\n\"They are good players but I don't think they were Man Utd players. I don't think Sir Alex and David Gill would have signed those players.\n\n\"We are in this position now because we have signed players who are not Man Utd players.\n\n\"Ole is in there now and trying to put it right.\"", "description": "The club's former midfielder says things have been going wrong at the club since Woodward took up the executive vice-chairman role in 2013", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20095886.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Paul-Scholes-comments-on-Manchester-United-v-Everton-game.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
