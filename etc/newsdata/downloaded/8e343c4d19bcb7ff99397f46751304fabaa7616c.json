According to The Hollywood Reporter, the actress joins Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep in a feature adaptation of the Broadway musical The Prom. The story concerns a teenage lesbian in Indiana who wants to take her girlfriend to the big school dance, but is banned by the school. To address this injustice, a group of eccentric Broadway actors head to the town to help the disenfranchised young women fight for their rights. (So, imagine the cast in Waiting for Guffman coming to get you your gay rights in small-town America.) The movie, like its stage source material, will also be a musical. So that\u2019s great news, and in addition to Streep, Washington, and Kidman, it will also star James Corden, Awkwafina, Ariana Grande, Keegan-Michael Key, and Andrew Rannells. If you\u2019ve read all of this then congratulations: you\u2019re now 64 percent more gay.", "description": "Kerry Washington joins Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep in Ryan Murphy\u2019s The Prom, a Broadway musical adaptation for Netflix.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/07/07-kerry-washington.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
