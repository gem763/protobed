The committee told POLITICO that the Pentagon has not responded to their inquiries as part of the probe.\n\nThough Air Force officials have insisted that the crews' stops to refuel at the Prestwick Airport adhered to existing guidelines for military stopovers, the agency has said it will determine whether or not it is appropriate for members to stay at properties owned by the commander in chief.\n\nOfficials also said that in the case of an April stay by a crew at Turnberry, which sparked the Oversight investigation, the members \"used the closest available and least expensive accommodations to the airfield within the crews\u2019 allowable hotel rates.\"\n\nThe revelations come as the Trump administration has already come under fire for attempting to divert Pentagon funding to build the president\u2019s long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAccusations that Trump\u2019s properties are unfairly profiting off of his administration have dogged the president since entering office. Ethics officials and lawmakers have raised concerns about foreign officials staying at Trump hotels, and noted that Trump supporters and industry groups regularly throw bashes at Trump-owned locations. Trump is also considering hosting next year\u2019s G-7 summit of world leaders at his Doral resort in Miami, a potential financial boon for the property, and has previously stayed at the Turnberry property during an official visit to the United Kingdom.\n\nLast week, Vice President Mike Pence raised eyebrows when he stayed at Trump\u2019s resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, during a visit there, despite its location hundreds of miles away from his meetings in Dublin. The Oversight Committee is investigating that stay as well.\n\nTrump on Monday defended Pence\u2019s stay at Doonbeg, writing on Twitter that he played no role in Pence\u2019s decision to stay there despite Pence\u2019s chief of staff telling reporters originally that Trump had suggested it.\n\n\u201cI had nothing to do with the decision of our great @VP Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump owned resorts in Doonbeg, Ireland,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cMike\u2019s family has lived in Doonbeg for many years, and he thought that during his very busy European visit, he would stop and see his family!\u201d", "description": "The US Air Force has ordered a worldwide review of how the branch chooses overnight accommodations for its crews.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166103080-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
