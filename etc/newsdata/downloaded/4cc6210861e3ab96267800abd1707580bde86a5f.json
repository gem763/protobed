All three major U.S. stock indexes\u2014the , the and the \u2014closed at record highs on Friday.\n\nInflation Ticks Up\n\nThe consumer price index released on Thursday showed the biggest increase in prices in a year and a half in June once food and energy prices were taken out. This so-called core inflation rate was up 0.3% and 2.1% . Median forecasts were for 0.2% and 2.0% respectively.\n\nNot such a big deal while investors were more excited about the administration\u2019s decision to abandon its plan to curb drug rebates, which threatened to throw the drug industry into disarray. United American Healthcare Corp (OTC: ) rose over 7% and powered the across the 27,000 mark for the first time.\n\nThe overall CPI, in fact, was up only 0.1% in June and 1.6% , compared to 0.1% and 1.8% respectively in May.\n\nOn Friday, the producer price index, a measure of wholesale prices, also came in slightly higher than expected. The PPI gained 0.1% and 1.7% , compared with forecasts of no change and 1.6% respectively. In any case, it was the smallest year-on-year gain in two and a half years.\n\nThe index had also gained 0.1% in May, but was up 1.8% on the year that month. So price gains are slowing down, just not quite as much as economists anticipated.\n\nForecast of CPI\n\nCore PPI\u2014again stripping out food and energy prices as well as trade services\u2014was unchanged on the month in June after registering 0.4% increases the previous two months. The year-on-year gain was 2.1%, down from 2.3% in May.\n\nIn theory, the PPI is a forecast of the CPI as wholesale prices are expected to flow into consumer prices. It\u2019s a rough measure, but to the extent that it holds, the CPI is also likely to show a slowdown in the next month or so.\n\nFed Focus\n\nIn point of fact, Fed policymakers don\u2019t pay much attention to either of these inflation measures. They have decided that the personal consumption expenditures index most closely tracks the price increases people are dealing with.\n\nThis PCE index, which is released later in the month, generally runs lower than CPI/PPI. That index showed a 0.2% gain on the month for May, and 1.5% on the year, while the rose 0.2% on the month and 1.6% on the year.\n\nInvestors are not anguishing over any of this, however. Commentators slice and dice the data\u2014apparel prices are up, energy prices down, and so on\u2014but a rate cut is considered to be baked in.\n\nHalf-Point Cut Unlikely\n\nThe uptick in inflation does probably preclude the half-point cut some analysts were optimistically hoping for. It may also call a September cut\u2014still prognosticated by Fed funds futures\u2014into question.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that the PCE gain would come anywhere near the Fed\u2019s 2% target in the next month or two, policymakers have no need to cut rates now. They have said for some time that the target should be \u201csymmetrical\u201d\u2014that is, there should be several months of overshooting 2% to balance the many months of undershooting.\n\nInverted Yield Curve May Be Key\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, which will meet July 30-31, will probably find the inverted yield curve a more compelling consideration than inflation. Yields on Treasury bills have been running higher than the notes for more than 30 trading days, a sign that recession is on the way within the next 12 months.\n\nOn both days of his congressional testimony last week, Fed chair affirmed the Fed is ready to take action to sustain growth. It wants to bring those short-term rates back down below the long-term rates and cutting the Fed funds rate is the best way to do it.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Darrell Delamaide/Investing.com) covering: .
