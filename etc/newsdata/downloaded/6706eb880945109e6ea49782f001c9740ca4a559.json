Scientists have long known that plants grow better in CO 2 -enriched air, and some hypothesize that steadily rising amounts of atmospheric carbon might protect forests\u2019 health despite the otherwise deteriorating circumstances. Most likely, such carbon fertilization has already boosted the productivity of forests all over the world. But many researchers who study tropical forests predict that whatever benefit trees are getting will wane. It may have already started to taper off.\n\nThe nightmare scenario is that a hostile blend of heat and drought\u2014not to mention fires like the ones that destroyed more than 2 million acres of the Amazon and reddened Indonesia\u2019s skies this summer\u2014will turn tropical forests into a far less luxuriant habitat, wringing out the carbon sponge. According to Denning, if tropical forests absorb less carbon and release some of what\u2019s already stockpiled in trunks and soil, it could raise global temperatures by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit this century. Such a catastrophe would wipe out the benefits of all the climate-change policies that any country so far has put in place or seriously contemplated.\n\nRead: The Amazon fires are more dangerous than WMDs\n\nDespite the potential for dramatic consequences, scientists still haven\u2019t settled on what the future holds for these jungles. So I decided to see for myself how they\u2019re trying to figure it out. I loaded up on tropical-disease vaccinations, picked a lightweight mosquito net, and bought an airplane ticket to Rwanda.\n\nAt a border crossing between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo in early 2017, I rendezvoused with Wannes Hubau, a Belgian geographer with the build of a wrestler, a brooding manner, and a taste for adventure. It was only weeks after Joseph Kabila, then the president of the DRC, had refused to step down at the end of his term. To avoid the violent backlash and safely reach our destination, Hubau and I had to slip in from Rwanda on foot, catch a taxi to the nearest airport in Goma, fly to the sleepy city of Kisangani, and drive to the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve, at the heart of the Congo rainforest.\n\nThe day after our journey, Hubau stared into the forest of huge buttressed trunks and trees perched on stilts as if summoning the will to hog-tie a spiny palm to the ground. Flies buzzed around his head; he swatted one, and it gave off a sickly sweet scent. He held a piece of paper marked Plot 08, clamped to a clipboard. It listed the previously measured size and location of 384 trees in the thicket encircling us. The painted blazes that marked the height where he hoped to remeasure each tree were gone, chewed off by ants. Identifying tags nailed too closely into the bark had been swallowed up by growth. \u201cThey always give me the hard sites,\u201d he grumbled.", "description": "Many forecasts for climate change assume that tropical forests will continue to soak up carbon dioxide as the world warms.
