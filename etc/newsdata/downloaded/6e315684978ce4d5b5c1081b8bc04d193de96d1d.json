We have to forget that because we live in the future, we live for now and we have to perform and this team is a different team.\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\n\u201cWe are building a new team and developing a new team. Now we have to step up and become better. Sometimes you fall down but you also have to step up again and be better, develop. That's only possible when you play out of your philosophy. Attitude to be better every day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different also in the tactics but that\u2019s normal because you lose players and the players you get in are different types.\n\n\u201cEvery player has its own identity, we are playing a little differently but I think we\u2019re still a strong team and I believe it\u2019s a strong team, I believe it can develop and be again very successful.\u201d\n\nAjax are trying to build a new generation this season to blend into last year\u2019s squad with ex-Manchester United defender Daley Blind, 29, one of the survivors.\n\nBlind was asked what he made of Chelsea\u2019s fortunes this season as compared to United as they have been struggling.\n\n(Image: AMA/Getty)\n\nHe added: \u201cOf course I\u2019m not happy to see Man United and how they\u2019re performing, how they\u2019re doing at the moment, I\u2019m still a fan of United, it\u2019s not nice to see.\n\n\u201cAbout Chelsea, they are doing well, their philosophy, like the manager said they want to play from the back, they play different attacking football with a lot of youngsters and that\u2019s something nice to see.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at that, it\u2019s good. But if you\u2019re taking about United then I\u2019m not happy about that of course.\u201d\n\nAjax are confident that the pitch in their stadium will be in good shape despite hosting the Amsterdam Music Festival at the weekend which lasts year attracted 40,000 fans.\n\nTen Hag added: \u201cIt looks very good and in my opinion it\u2019s fine to play.\u201d", "description": "The Blues take on last season's semi-finalists on Wednesday evening and ten Hag believes his side can go far in the competition again", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Ama Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20692629.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Champions-League-Ajax-Amsterdam-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
