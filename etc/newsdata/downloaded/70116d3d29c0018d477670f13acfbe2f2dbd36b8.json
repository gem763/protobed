His assistants cooled it off in ice so that it could harden and be measured.\n\n\"I was frequently asked by customers how long or thin the noodles can be. Those inquiries led me to the idea of measuring noodles,\" Kuroda said.\n\nGuinness World Records\n\nKuroda told the world record officials that the combination of ingredients and quantifying balances and proportions has \"always fascinated me because the food is enjoyable when those figures and combinations are in sync.\"\n\n\"I get great satisfaction in nailing that,\" the new world record holder said.\n\nKuroda also holds the records for the most noodle portions prepared in three minutes, the thinnest handmade Chinese noodle -- 0.22 mm -- and the most noodle strings made in one minute -- 65,536.", "description": "Japanese chef Hiroshi Kuroda earned the Guinness World Record for", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/GWR_LONGESTNOODLE_589015_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
