I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone, but the endless \u201cwell likes\u201d, \u201cwots\u201d and \u201cnahs\u201d drive me up the wall.\n\nMy worry is he will be judged by the way he speaks and that people will make \u00adill-informed judgments as a result.\n\nAnd this week scientists proved I was right to be concerned.\n\nResearchers at Yale \u00adUniversity have discovered interviewers made immediate assumptions about a \u00adcandidate\u2019s socioeconomic status based on just a handful of words.\n\nPeople seen as coming from a higher class were deemed as being more \u00adcompetent than someone of a lower social class. As a result, they were more likely to be recommended for higher starting salaries and signing up bonuses. All this based on just seven words.\n\nIn recent years there\u2019s been a trend for people, especially ones with regional accents, to take elocution lessons to change the way they sound. Many have said they felt less confident about their jobs because of their voices.\n\nI\u2019ve certainly known where they\u2019re coming from. For a long time I was hung up about the way I sounded.\n\nI remember doing TV interviews when I was a 3am columnist and not wanting to speak because I didn\u2019t like my South London accent. When I spoke I adopted this strange fake posh voice which a reader described as \u201cupper-class rude girl\u201d.\n\nThat still stings, but I agreed I sounded awful. I never felt the need to take elocution lessons like Margaret Thatcher but I made a conscious decision to slow down and speak more clearly.\n\nNow my son tells me I sound, horror of horrors, posh. I disagree.\n\nThe way we sound is a huge part of who are, and clearly no one should have to erase who they are to get ahead or to feel comfortable at work.\n\nBut at the same time when you think about the dialects we hear every day on the TV and radio, posh accents \u00addominate, which reinforces the \u00adstereotype that people who sound like that are naturally better at, well, everything.\n\nWe need to hear a more diverse range of accents to help break down these barriers. And we need to encourage young people to leave the slang at home sometimes so their voices don\u2019t hold them back.\n\nAnd finally, we should remember, the people with the plummiest voices aren\u2019t always the best people for the job.\n\nJust look at Boris Johnson.", "description": "Yale University researchers have proved the way we talk can hold us back, but we shouldn't be ashamed of our accents \u2013 they're a big part of who we are", "authors": ["Eva Simpson", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708560.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Margaret-Thatcher.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
