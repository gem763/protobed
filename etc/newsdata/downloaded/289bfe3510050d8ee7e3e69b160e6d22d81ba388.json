It is not true. Racists warrant only disgust and no airtime. Letting them explain themselves only normalises their perverted views.\n\nThis was proven true over the past few days in Italy. Andrea Dell\u2019 Aquila, a Roma fan, sent a direct message to Juan Jesus on Instagram. The words directed at the Brazilian defender were as disgusting as they were outrageous: \u201cYou belong in a zoo, damn monkey, ******.\u201d\n\nJesus plays for the team that Dell\u2019 Aquila purports to support. Jesus was appalled. To their credit, the 26-year-old and Roma refused to let it slide. The club reported the post to police and Instagram and banned the transgressor for life.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Recognising that bigotry is a much wider problem that needed addressing, the club put the authorities on the spot. \u201cAre you really serious about tackling racism in Italian football @SerieA,\u201d they tweeted the league.\n\nIt was a bold move by Roma on a number of fronts. They are the first team in Italy to ban a supporter for life \u2013 before recent changes in the law, the onus was on police to bar individuals from stadiums.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There have been too many incidents of racism on the ruling body\u2019s watch and too little response of any significance.\n\nIn general, the reaction in Italy was positive. Giuseppe Conte, the Prime Minister, tweeted praise for Roma, as did a number of politicians. Supporters from across the country applauded the club\u2019s response.\n\nRoma use social media brilliantly and have a dynamic, inclusive vision of how the game should operate. They were not afraid to go out on a limb. The tweet to Serie A essentially said, \u2018this is not just about us or Jesus. It\u2019s about football and society. It\u2019s a problem for everyone. We need leadership. Are the people running the sport prepared to lead?\u201d\n\nIt is a pertinent inquiry, applicable way outside Italy's borders.\n\nThen on Sunday, La Repubblica, a centrist newspaper, published an interview with Dell\u2019 Aquila that seemed to shift the discussion towards a different debate. The questions were soft to the point of parody. After all the usual, trite, \u201cI made a mistake, I don\u2019t want to make excuses,\u201d guff, he criticised Jesus and Roma for invading his privacy by naming and shaming him. \u201cTo have me undergo public humiliation is too much,\u201d Dell\u2019 Aquila said.\n\nIt was a private message, he claimed, and exposing his name was \u201cserious.\u201d Diddums. How quickly the bullies squeal when confronted and identified.\n\n\u201cDo you realise what it means to receive threats, insults, like \u2018I hope you will die\u2019?\u201d Dell\u2019 Aquila was allowed to ask, as if he was the victim. \u201cI am convinced that 90 per cent of the people who are attacking me have said the same things at least once in their lives.\u201d\n\nThat statement was allowed to go unchallenged. The follow-up question was: \u2018Are you a racist?\u2019 You all know the answer. People like this never are, are they? They are invariably misunderstood.\n\nThe interview even allowed Dell\u2019 Aquila to conjure up an image that feeds a host of provocative racial stereotypes. \u201cWhat if I go home now and find 10 black boys waiting for me? Did Juan Jesus think of that?\u201d\n\nThe gall is breathtaking. Roma\u2019s hierarchy were shocked by the piece. Trying to turn an unsolicited, gratuitous insult into an invasion of privacy issue after it backfired is a classic attempt at misdirection. No doubt the closet and overt bigots across Italy will seize on the chance to shift the narrative.\n\nThe bottom line is simple. Racism is as racism does. There are no excuses, no justifications and there should be no exceptions. Sometimes people may not realise what they are doing or saying. It can be insidious and ingrained.\n\nManchester City should have realised this after Bernardo Silva\u2019s inappropriate tweet about Benjamin Mendy last week. The two players might be close but that\u2019s hardly the point. If neither can see that Silva used a crude, racist image then they both need to be educated. It is unlikely Mendy would require much clarification. The Frenchman has probably spent a large proportion of his career - nay, his life - smiling awkwardly at some of his white friends\u2019 witticisms. Letting it go just feeds the boorishness.\n\nEven worse, Pep Guardiola and Raheem Sterling defended Silva. How much more refreshing would it have been if Sterling in particular \u2013 in the week Megan Rapinoe lauded the winger for his stance on racism - had admitted that the image Silva tweeted was ugly and demeaning? Perhaps the Portuguese has grown up never thinking about this sort of thing. Most people don\u2019t comprehend their position of privilege and never stop to consider the implications of their \u2018jokes.\u2019 Silva needs to understand the notion of institutional racism and how it manifests itself in crass humour.\n\nIt reflects badly on everyone at City. Excusing someone because, \u2018he\u2019s my friend,\u2019 is the flip side of \u2018I\u2019d send them all back, except for people like you, mate. Don\u2019t have a problem with people like you.\u2019\n\nRoma sent out the right message. City have not. Everyone in football needs to take a long, hard look at how they deal with racism. The only voice worth listening to is the one that calls out racist attitudes.", "description": "There is a myth that everyone deserves a voice, that there are two sides to every argument.
