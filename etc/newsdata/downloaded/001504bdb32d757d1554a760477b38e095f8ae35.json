While It Chapter Two topped the weekend box office, a series of behind-the-scenes snapshots from the set of the Stephen King horror sequel rose in the ranks of the Twitter meme economy:\n\nThe candid photos appear to show Bill Hader, who plays the all-grown-up version of Finn Wolfhard\u2019s character Richie, palling around on set with Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, in full Pennywise regalia. Then, so the story goes, Skarsg\u00e5rd moves his eyes in two different directions, freaking gentle, sweet Hader out and making him run away. The moment has already been meme\u2019d aplenty, on account of Hader\u2019s gleefully expressive terror and the joy of seeing Pennywise just joshin\u2019 around.\n\nIt\u2019s also definitely based on a true story. During a Conan appearance back in January, Hader addressed the photo of him and Skarsg\u00e5rd clowning around after Conan O\u2019Brien brought it up:\n\nWhen he\u2019s playing that character, it is terrifying. Like he\u2019ll be talking about \u2026 we were probably talking about music or movies or whatever, and the minute they say \u2018action\u2019 he\u2019s so terrifying. And he can do, I go, how do they do that thing in the first movie, where your eye kinda goes out? Pennywise, I don\u2019t know if you saw the movie, but when he senses something, he kinda goes like [insert Bill Hader doin\u2019 his darndest Pennywise impression here], you know, and his eyes kinda go like that? And I go, \u2018Is that a digital thing?\u2019 And he goes, \u2018Oh, you mean this?\u2019 And he did it! I was like aaaaah! Aaaah!\n\nHader also added that It Chapter Two was hard for him to film because \u2014 get this, stan accounts \u2014 he smiles when he\u2019s scared.
