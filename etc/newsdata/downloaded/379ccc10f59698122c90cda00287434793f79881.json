But Guardiola has again backed with Silva, describing him as an \u201cexceptional person\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the people believe Bernardo is this type of person they are completely wrong. They judge one joke - I judge three years with him,\u201d Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.\n\n\u201cBernardo, or anyone else in my squad, do these things for a joke. Benjamin is like a brother to Bernardo, that is what I see every single day here.\u201d\n\nAnti-racism body Kick It Out condemned Silva\u2019s actions saying racist stereotypes are never acceptable as \u2018banter\u2019, while the Football Association has written to City requesting their observations.\n\nBritish media reported Silva has submitted a personal latter to the FA expressing regret at any unintentional offence his tweet caused, while Mendy wrote a supporting statement.\n\nGuardiola was asked he if understood why Silva has come under criticism for the tweet.\n\n\u201cIf someone is affected or feels bad about that tweet or any comments, it can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is an exceptional person.\n\n\u201cFocus on other issues, not Bernardo. It was just a joke. The same happened a thousand times with white people. It was a cartoon.\n\n\u201cIf someone is offended I can understand it. Bernardo is maybe going to take a lesson and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nCity, currently second in the Premier League with 13 points from six matches, visit 14th-placed Everton on Saturday.", "description": "Manager Pep Guardiola has offered another impassioned defence of Bernardo Silva after the Manchester City midfielder faced accusations of racism over a deleted tweet relating to teammate Benjamin Mendy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434568436&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q163", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
