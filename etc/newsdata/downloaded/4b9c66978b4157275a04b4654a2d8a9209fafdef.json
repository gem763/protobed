Read this if you have an older iPhone and are unsure about what comes next. If you\u2019d also like to know more about my testing of the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models\u2014particularly their camera and battery life\u2014go here.\n\nGather \u2019round for a tale of two iPhone owners.\n\nSir Upgrades-A-Lot owns an iPhone XS and is salivating over the $1,099 iPhone 11 Pro Max. He just can\u2019t wait to test the new ultra-wide camera and caress the new textured matte midnight-green glass finish.\n\nThen there\u2019s Sir Sixer. His old iPhone is held together with duct tape and chewing gum, and Apple has publicly announced it will no longer be making software for it.\n\nI had a tough time reviewing the new iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. With their significant boost in battery life and new camera tricks, they serve Apple\u2019s most dedicated audience, but alone they don\u2019t address the needs of those who wrote us by the hundreds in recent weeks, people who don\u2019t know what to do when upgrading their iPhone 7 or 6\u2026or even 5.\n\nWith Apple\u2019s yearly upgrade hypecycle, it\u2019s easy to lose track of the reality that most people are holding on to their phones for longer and longer\u2014sometimes four or five years. And some of the better options for those people aren\u2019t the brand new $1,000-and-up Pro phones, but cut-rate models from prior years. Meanwhile, with a jump to 5G likely for 2020, they might want to pick something that either doesn\u2019t cost too much or will hold its trade-in value.\n\nGoing from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone 11 means big improvements in everything from the screen to the battery to the camera. You will lose that headphone jack but all new iPhones come with headphones that plug into the Lightning port.

For most, I recommend the $699 iPhone 11. It has great battery life and all the new camera tricks (minus the telephoto lens of the Pro models). I decided to shoot a bunch of photos with the iPhone 6 vs. the iPhone 11 over the past week and the low-light shots, especially, show us how far the technology has come.\n\nThe leaps in low-light photography are clear when you compare the iPhone 6S with the iPhone 11\u2019s new night mode.

If you don\u2019t want so much phone, the $999 iPhone 11 Pro has a smaller footprint but a fancier screen and cameras.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What features matter to you most as you consider an upgrade? How much will price influence your final decision? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u2026the iPhone 6, 7 or 8 owner with concerns about Face ID?\n\nI\u2019ve heard many people say they don\u2019t want to move to Apple\u2019s facial-recognition system. If that\u2019s you, I hope to set your mind at ease: I find Face ID to be faster and more convenient than the fingerprint sensor. Apple\u2019s had three years to work out the kinks and Face ID is even faster on the new iPhone 11 models. Also, remember that this all happens on your phone: Apple Inc. doesn\u2019t secretly upload your face every time you unlock your screen.\n\nA slightly bigger challenge comes in learning the new gestures to navigate a phone without the home button but I have faith in you. I also made this handy manual when I reviewed the iPhone X, the first phone to go home-button-free.\n\nSome people who are used to the older iPhone Touch ID fingerprint scanner are concerned about making the jump to Face ID facial recognition, but the latter is actually faster and more convenient in many cases.

Perhaps you\u2019ll want to stockpile them!\n\n\u2026the iPhone SE owner who really wants a smaller phone?\n\nI wish I had better news for all you small-phone lovers, but all signs point to Apple forgetting about this phone soon. Your best choice is the iPhone 8 too. I did some retesting of the iPhone 8\u2019s camera this past week. Sadly, you don\u2019t get portrait mode on the smaller model, but it takes quite respectable photos\u2014even in low light. You also get wireless charging, which all new iPhones now have.\n\n\u2026the iPhone X owner considering holding out for one more year?\n\nYou, my iPhone X-owning friend, have it hardest of all. You\u2019ve got the most modern design but you\u2019re now behind on battery life, Face ID improvements and camera tricks. Yet if you upgrade this go-round, you might miss out on next year\u2019s expected big refresh with 5G and more.\n\nIf you can live with the current phone, hang onto it for another year. If not, go with the iPhone 11 and skip the iPhone 11 Pro. You might miss that telephoto camera and OLED screen, but you can put $300 toward next year\u2019s upgrade, and enjoy some extra battery life in the meantime.\n\nThe ultra-wide camera on the iPhone 11 lets you take very artistic photos without much movement.

But some\u2014upset about ever increasing screen sizes and the yearly upgrade roller coaster\u2014suggested they might jump to Android.\n\nThere\u2019s no question there are high-quality Android options, particularly the Galaxy S and Note lines from Samsung and the Pixel line from Google, which deliver performance that\u2019s on par with iPhones. But when you stray from the flagships, in search of a smaller screen, or cheaper choices, or early 5G access, or a new folding form factor, you enter into early-adopter territory that\u2019s right for some but not for all.\n\nSo proceed with caution. Walled gardens like Apple\u2019s might pen you in, but they can also keep out the lions and tigers and bears. For a demonstration of those pros and cons, see the new \u201cSign in with Apple\u201d feature.\n\nRelated Video Apple\u2019s new trio of iPhones promise improved cameras\u2014the Pros now have three on the back\u2014and longer battery life.
