If it happens, it would be Britain's choice.'\n\nMichel Barnier rejected the UK's latest offer of a deal which sets out a complex plan for the Northern Ireland border, saying the EU needed it to 'change'\n\nBritain will leave the EU in 25 days without a deal unless senior figures agree to compromise. In the case of a delay Mr Johnson will 'paralyse' the EU, senior aides revealed\n\nMr Barnier added: 'If they do not change, I do not believe, on the basis of the mandate I have been given by the EU27, that we can advance.'\n\nIt came as the PM warned of plans to 'sabotage' the European Union by vetoing the bloc's seven-year budget if a deal is not reached by October 31.\n\nBritain will leave the EU in 25 days without a deal unless senior figures agree to compromise. In the case of a delay Mr Johnson will 'paralyse' the EU, senior aides revealed.\n\nIf Brexit is pushed back after October 31 the leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, could be drafted in as the British Commissioner in Brussels to 'disrupt' meetings, reports claim.\n\nOn Saturday Mr Johnson started phoning his EU counterparts to sell his proposals for a managed withdrawal from the bloc, after the latest plans were given short shrift by Brussels.\n\nEuropean diplomats say London needs to offer a revised, viable way forward before the end of next week, so that any haggling and legalistic work is done before a crucial EU summit on October 17-18.\n\nThat high-stakes European Council meeting will determine whether Britain is headed for an agreement, extension, or potentially disastrous no-deal.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne - whose country currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency - said he had told Johnson it was 'important to find a solution within a week' and the British leader 'agreed with the timetable'.\n\nDutch Premier Mark Rutte tweeted he had told Johnson 'important questions remain about the British proposals' and 'there is a lot of work to be done ahead' of the summit.\n\nJohnson was expected to also call the leaders of other EU countries after talks broke up without progress Friday between a top UK Brexit official, David Frost, and Mr Barnier.\n\nThe UK had been keen for discussions to continue through the weekend, but they were set to restart on Monday.\n\nIf Brexit is pushed back after October 31 the leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage , could be drafted in as the British Commissioner in Brussels to 'disrupt' meetings, reports claim\n\nLatvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins said today that Mr Johnson's Brexit offer is a 'basis for negotiations'.\n\n'I have full trust in the Commission as our negotiator to try to find a good compromise with the UK,' he told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show.\n\n'If Mr Johnson is willing to negotiate that's a very good sign and certainly from Europe's side we are always looking for a deal that works for everyone.'\n\nMr Karins said striking a deal was 'fully dependent on the will of Mr Johnson because from the European side we are always open and looking towards a deal'.\n\n'If a deal can be found that keeps the single market intact and is not bad for the Republic of Ireland I think it would work for the rest of the EU as well.'\n\nMr Karins added that the EU 'doesn't have a whole lot of wriggle room' in negotiating a new deal, but said some tweaks were possible.\n\n'To open up the entire agreement I think that is very unrealistic, certainly in the short time frame.'\n\nHe said the PM 'probably' could get an extension if it was to help 'hammer out a deal which is good for everyone'.\n\n'But just extending for the sake of extension I think there would be quite a bit of debate within the EU.'", "description": "Michel Barnier rejected the UK's latest offer of a deal which sets out a complex plan for the Northern Ireland border, saying the EU needed it to 'change'.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/08/19354626-0-image-a-18_1570347067457.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
