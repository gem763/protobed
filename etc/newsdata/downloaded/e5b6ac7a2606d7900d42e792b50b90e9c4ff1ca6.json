This is yet another unacceptable loss of like within a broken service. The system that is homelessness is continuing to fail out most vulnerable in society.\n\n\"Enough is not being done to implement enough safe and secure accommodation for those who require it. We have a homelessness epidemic with on average 160 people sleeping rough every night, resulting in deaths in our streets.\n\n\"This can\u2019t become normal or acceptable. The Minister must activate the cold winter initiative immediately and insure beds are available for all who want to access.\u201d\n\nGardai have confirmed a post mortem will take place and determine the course of investigation.\n\nA garda spokesman said: \"Garda\u00ed are investigating the sudden death of a man (late 30s) who passed away in St. James Hospital at 8am this morning, Sunday 20th October, 2019.\n\n\"Garda\u00ed were alerted to the incident by passing pedestrians who observed the man unconscious at Foster Place at approximately 7am. He was removed to St. James Hospital where he passed away.\n\n\"A post mortem will be conducted which will determine the course of the investigation.\"", "description": "Passersby noticed a man in his 30s lying unconscious in the middle of the street during the morning hours", "authors": ["Rory Lynskey", "Neil Murphy", "Image", "Google", "Ichh"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662487.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_homeless-man.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
