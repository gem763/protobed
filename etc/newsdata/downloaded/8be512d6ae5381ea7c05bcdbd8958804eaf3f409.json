Bill Flores (R-Texas) announced Wednesday that he will not seek reelection in 2020, adding his name to the growing list of Republicans in Congress looking to give up their seats.\n\n\u201cAfter much prayer over the past few days and following conversations with my wife, Gina, during that time, I have decided that my current term will be my last,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nFlores, first elected in 2010, is currently serving out his fifth term representing his state\u2019s 17th Congressional District, an area near Austin that includes Waco.\n\nHe is one of at least a dozen Republican representatives who have so far announced they will not seek reelection \u2015 and the fifth from Texas alone. The retirements present opportunities for Democrats to flip conservative-held seats as they seek maintain their grip on the House in 2020.\n\nServing my country as the Representative of the hardworking Texas families in the 17th Congressional District has been an honor and one of the greatest privileges of my life. \u2014 U.S. Representative Bill Flores (@RepBillFlores) September 4, 2019\n\nFlores said in his statement that he had never intended to serve more than six terms, and wishes to spend more time with his family.\n\n\u201cEven though my current term will be my final in Congress, I will continue working with a sense of urgency and diligence over the next 16 months to continue fulfilling my original campaign promises to the good folks in TX-17 to restore Liberty, Opportunity, and Security for hardworking Texas families who were left behind due to the disastrous policies of the Obama administration,\u201d Flores stated.\n\nHe plans to \u201cresume business activities in the private sector,\u201d where he previously worked as an oil industry executive.\n\nTexas Democrats said Flores\u2019 exit was a way to \u201csave face rather than be thrown out of office.\u201d\n\n\u201cTexas is the biggest battleground state. Republicans know it and Texas Democrats damn sure know it,\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement.\n\nFlores\u2019 district is not currently expected to be very competitive, according to The Texas Tribune.\n\nOthers in the House who will sit out the next election cycle include: Rep.

Dave Loebsack (D-Iowa).\n\nA handful of Senate members, including Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), are also not seeking reelection. Sen.
