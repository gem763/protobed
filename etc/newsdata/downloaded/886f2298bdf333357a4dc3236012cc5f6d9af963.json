(Liverpool fans) will not get home until after midnight and the following day is back to work for many.\n\n\"And let's not forget the Leicester City employees and those working in public services who will be required to work these hours. How will they get there, and how will they get home?\n\n\"The Premier League and TV companies repeatedly ignore the welfare of supporters. But they do have a chance to redeem themselves.\n\n\"Spirit of Shankly call on the authorities to do the right thing and revert all Boxing Day fixtures to a sensible kick-off time. We suggest 3pm.\"\n\n(Image: 2019 Liverpool FC)\n\nAmazon Prime's first foray into screening Premier League matches starts with a set of midweek fixtures on December 3, 4 and 5 while there are four kick-off times for the Boxing Day fixtures.\n\nTottenham will welcome Brighton in a match that will start at 12.30pm, there will be six 3pm kick-offs while Newcastle are scheduled to visit Manchester United at 5.30pm.\n\nBT Sport, meanwhile, will televise nine games on New Year's Day, plus Liverpool's meeting with Sheffield United on January 2.\n\nManchester City are themselves unhappy with the Christmas schedule, as they face three games in the space of six days because of the fixture reshuffle.\n\nFollowing their trip to Wolves, they have 48 hours to prepare for the visit of Sheffield United on December 29 before welcoming Everton on New Year's Day.\n\nOmar Berrada, chief operating officer of City, told the Manchester Evening News: \"We're disappointed that the schedule is so tight for the players over Christmas.\n\n\"Premier League games are a huge physical demand, and it's not ideal to be made to play twice in less than 48 hours because it doesn't give the players time to properly recover.\n\n\"We obviously understand that the paying rights-holding broadcasters are an important consideration when it comes to scheduling, but we also need to make sure that we protect the players' well-being, the sporting integrity of the league, and the quality of the product.\"", "description": "Amazon Prime will show nine matches on Boxing Day, spread across four kickoff times - with Liverpool facing Leicester City at 8pm", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex", "Liverpool Fc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16212593.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-vs-Wolverhampton-Wanderers-United-Kingdom-12-May-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
