Chadwick went flying out of the blocks in May, winning the first race and holding onto her lead until the culmination of the season at Brands Hatch in August, despite being chased closely by runner-up, Holland's Beitske Visser.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph can now confirm that Chadwick will return to the W Series in 2020, along with the rest of the top 12 from last season, which includes three other British drivers - Jessica Hawkins, Sarah Moore and last season's third-placed Alice Powell. The calendar for next season is yet to be released, but is expected to be expanded to eight races.\n\nChadwick has made no secret of her ambitions to one day race in Formula One and the fact that FIA Superlicence points (40 of which are required to be F1 eligible) will be granted to W Series winners next season had a major sway in her decision.", "description": "Jamie Chadwick will attempt to defend her W Series title in 2020, the Daily Telegraph can reveal, in what she has confirmed will be her final participation in the all-female motor racing championship.", "authors": ["Molly Mcelwee", "Dame Sarah Storey", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000210970899-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq14eNwzJLvYQJbXrcyyarlCPyir9oEwubCgQMa-ICRB8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
