Everyone is watching. Nobody knows how it\u2019ll end. Stay tuned.\n\nOn Nov. 1, Apple TV+ will launch globally and start rolling out prestige television shows on a weekly basis. Subscribers paying $5.99 month can watch dystopian action series \u201cSee\u201d or see Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a drama that reportedly has a budget of US$300 million for two seasons.\n\nBut any hype around Apple\u2019s offering will almost immediately get swamped on Nov. 12 with the Canadian launch of the Disney+ streaming service, which is expected to parade old Disney animated movies, along with new television series from both the Star Wars and Marvel Cinematic Universe franchises.\n\nThe Apple and Disney subscription streaming services will join a market already occupied by Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. In the United States, the landscape is even more complex: AT&T TimeWarner is preparing to launch a streaming competitor called HBO Max and NBCUniversal will launch Peacock, joining CBS All-Access already online.\n\nThere are different ways to draw the impending battle lines. From one angle, it\u2019s the legacy television players versus the upstarts, albeit deep-pocketed ones. From another, it\u2019s pure-play entertainment companies such as Netflix and HBO versus value-add services meant to bolster a larger brand like Apple or Amazon.\n\nEither way, though, now is the moment for Amazon, Apple, Disney, HBO, CBS, NBCUniversal, Netflix and others to grab a slice of the future of entertainment, or get left behind as the legacy broadcast and cable television market makes way for the new frontier of direct-to-consumer streaming.\n\nOf course, when it comes to streaming, like with so many other things, the Canadian version will be a little bit different, and less spectacular than south of the border.\n\nFor instance, nobody is quite sure exactly what will be initially streaming on Disney+ in Canada, said Brahm Eiley, founder of Convergence Research Group, which tracks internet, telecom and content offerings.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet everything about Disney, but we will know soon, right?\u201d Eiley said. \u201cAll the originals are global from day one, so we\u2019re really mostly talking about library, that\u2019s what differs at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nThe online streaming rights for various movies and television shows are a patchwork of country-specific licencing deals, with many long-term contracts signed years ago, before the streaming wars began.\n\nAs the various companies jockey for position in the lead-up to the streaming wars, much of the attention has been focused on securing rights to various legacy products. NBCUniversal reportedly spent US$500 million to re-acquire rights to \u201cThe Office\u201d and HBO Max reportedly shelled out US$425 million for \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, however, the presence of Bell Media\u2019s Crave rules out several major companies getting in the game, at least for now. For example, Crave is currently the home for HBO content, thanks to an agreement signed in 2014, shortly before Crave launched, and then extended in 2018.\n\n\u201cThere are no plans at this time to enter Canada with the HBO Max streaming service or change how HBO content is available in Canada,\u201d a spokesperson for HBO said in a one-line email.\n\nNBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock has no plans to launch in Canada either. And although CBS All Access is technically available in Canada, some of the most exciting CBS shows such as \u201cStar Trek: Discovery\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cStar Trek: Picard\u201d are absent from All Access here, because Crave already owns the rights to those properties.\n\nTracey Pearce, Bell Media\u2019s president of distribution and pay who directly oversees Crave, said the streaming service got a major boost earlier this year from people signing up to watch the blockbuster final season of the HBO show \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d She said Bell has been working hard to build an enticing library of content to keep those people, and grow the service.\n\nBut Pearce also said Bell doesn\u2019t really know where the streaming entertainment market is going. She suggested the company wants to maintain a viable presence in the space, but it also needs to strike a balance so it doesn\u2019t cannibalize existing television subscribers.\n\n\u201cIn terms of where Crave sits relative to CTV, relative to the Bell Media specialty channels, I think that we are continuing to invest and support our core channels in each of those spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not in a place where we\u2019re throwing overboard our specialty channels or our conventional channel business in favour of Crave.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kaan Yigit, president and research director at SRG, a Toronto-based consultant that tracks trends in television and video entertainment, said he\u2019s skeptical of Crave\u2019s future in the wider entertainment landscape since the real juice for streaming services will come from exclusive, original content, despite the initial focus on catalogues of old movies and television shows.\n\nUnlike the big U.S. players, Crave is only developing a handful of original shows and movies.\n\n\u201cCrave is all rental properties, and Bell isn\u2019t, in my opinion, fully committed. And they don\u2019t have the scale,\u201d Yigit said. \u201cCrave is doing okay, but, you know, it exists in a market of 30 million people on its own. Amazon and Netflix, they\u2019re thinking global. They\u2019re amortizing their costs globally. Apple will do the same thing. Disney is ultimately intending to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nAmazon and Netflix, they\u2019re thinking global Kaan Yigit, president and research director at SRG\n\nPeople might subscribe to a streaming service to binge old episodes of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d or \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d but original series such as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cStranger Things\u201d have been far more important in generating buzz for Netflix over the long term. Apple, meanwhile, is betting its entire service offering on original shows, since it doesn\u2019t have a library of legacy TV and movies at all.\n\nThe buzz about streaming is clearly growing. Home entertainment spending globally hit US$55.7 billion in 2018, according to a report by the Motion Picture Association of America, and the number of online video subscribers passed cable subscribers for the first time, although cable television still rakes in much more money.\n\nSpeaking to investors following a recent earnings call, Netflix chief financial officer Spence Neumann said that the price to acquire the most sought-after television shows has jumped by 30 per cent in just the past year.\n\nNetflix plans to spend some US$15 billion on content this year, while Apple, Disney, and Amazon are each reportedly spending billions as well, and that means more projects, and more work.\n\nDavid Coatsworth, a Toronto-based producer and production manager who\u2019s worked most of his career with HBO on shows such as \u201cJohn Adams\u201d and \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d said the industry was like \u201cthe Wild West\u201d a couple years ago, as new players ramped up production, but they have quickly matured into conventional production companies.\n\n\u201cAll across Canada, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver are bursting at the seams, and the volume of production going on worldwide, it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d Coatsworth said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the business for a very long time. My skill set is in more demand now than it\u2019s ever been. There\u2019s only a finite number of people who actually know how to do what I do, and I know a lot of the people in my business. We\u2019re all extremely busy.\u201d\n\nCoatsworth said major companies are signing multi-year leases and building out major production facilities, which indicates that the current flurry of activity isn\u2019t going to be a flash in the pan.\n\nIndustry experts agree the streaming wars are not going to be a one- or two-year affair. For one thing, it will likely be half a decade before it becomes clear which companies are dominating the market, and which ones can\u2019t compete.\n\nDeep-pocketed companies such as Apple and Disney can invest heavily and price aggressively to grow their market share. Moreover, Apple is offering its streaming service for free for a year to anybody who buys an Apple device, which will boost viewers even if its library remains small at first.\n\nIt will likely be half a decade before it becomes clear which companies are dominating the market, and which ones can\u2019t compete\n\nWhere Amazon fits into the landscape is particularly complicated, because Prime Video is not a standalone product. \u201cWhen we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes,\u201d Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos famously quipped in 2016.\n\nMarket dynamics are also likely to change before all of this is over.\n\nBoth Eiley and Yigit said Canadians have been slower than Americans when it comes to ditching traditional cable packages, but the cord-cutting is likely to accelerate as subscription services ramp up.\n\nIn the short term, one factor likely to keep people tied to the traditional television ecosystem is live sports; in many cases, there are no legal options in Canada to pay just for online streaming of pro sports. But that may change as streaming becomes a more dominant form of content delivery.\n\nAnother layer of complexity to consider when assessing the changing market is that unlike traditional television, none of the major streaming services are supported by ads, which radically changes the business model.\n\nAs profitability pressures mount, some companies may shift to a partially, or fully ad-supported model, said Eric Schmitt, an industry analyst for Gartner focused on TV and digital advertising.\n\n\u201cThe advertisers badly want to be in this media to get in front of these consumers, and consumers don\u2019t have unlimited budgets for discretionary entertainment like this, so you\u2019ve gotta think it\u2019s going to find a balance point,\u201d he said. \u201cThese algorithmic systems that are basically tailoring the ad load to our own individual tolerance level are going to play a big part in this.\u201d\n\nAt least for a while, the best way to look at the streaming wars is as a possible new golden age for television and film as studios invest billions of dollars to produce ambitious, prestige entertainment, and then offer it to consumers ad-free, on-demand and at prices far lower than a typical cable bill.\n\nUltimately, the real streaming wars may be the fight between legacy television players and digital direct-to-consumer streaming services.\n\nIndeed, Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings noted earlier this year that the competitive landscape as of November will be \u201ca whole new world,\u201d a wry nod to the song in the Disney movie \u201cAladdin,\u201d though he later downplayed the competitive threat from Disney and other new entrants.\n\n\u201cI was being a little playful with \u2018whole new world\u2019 in the sense of the drama of it coming, but fundamentally it\u2019s more of the same,\u201d he told analysts after announcing third-quarter results. \u201cAll of us are competing with linear TV; we\u2019re all relatively small to linear TV.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: jmcleod@nationalpost.com | Twitter: jamespmcleod", "description": "Now is the moment for Amazon, Apple, Disney, Netflix and others to grab a slice of the future of entertainment, or get left behind", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/television-colour-bars.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
