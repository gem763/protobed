Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nIf you\u2019ve never lived in a co-living space before but want to give it a try, Ascott\u2019s lyf (pronounced \u201clife\u201d) at Funan could be what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nAs one of Singapore\u2019s most established hospitality brands, Ascott\u2019s foray into the millennial-targeted market comes with careful consideration and research on what young working adults actually want out of their living spaces.\n\nThis includes everything from social networking to learning opportunities and an emphasis on flexible work and play.\n\nWe visited the 412-room property \u2013 Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest \u2013 on its opening day (September 5) to see if it\u2019s all it\u2019s made out to be and found that it ticked most (though not all) of the boxes.\n\nHere\u2019s what the lyf Funan experience is like in photos:\n\nThe best way to access lyf at Funan is through the Hill Street entrance.\n\ncaption A large orange question mark will tell you if you\u2019re at the right place. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThere is only one \u201cexpress\u201d lift at Lobby C which goes directly up to the fourth floor of Funan, where lyf is located.\n\ncaption You can\u2019t miss it with the huge lighted sign above. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nOnce you exit the lift at the fourth storey, you\u2019ll see lyf\u2019s neon lights on your left.\n\ncaption Can\u2019t miss this either! source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice is a laundry area located at the entrance.\n\ncaption The laundry area was placed at the entrance on purpose, deputy managing director of lyf, Mindy Tan said. This will hopefully attract passers-by and entice them into asking more about what the property has to offer, she explained. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThe laundry room comes complete with ironing facilities and a small seating area for guests.\n\ncaption source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nAlso at the entrance is a reception armed with \u201clyf guards\u201d, who help guests with various requests such as booking meeting rooms.\n\ncaption Don\u2019t forget to say hi! source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nVarious pop art pieces are on display in the property.\n\ncaption If you\u2019re hungry for a snack, grab a bite from the vending machine. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nGrown-ups play with grown-up games \u2013 like this giant Connect Four.\n\ncaption There are bean bags for you to sit on while playing. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nHow about a 0.6-metre deep pool?\n\ncaption Ball pit, we mean. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThe room doors at lyf are charmingly reminiscent of old shophouses in Singapore.\n\ncaption There were more designs other than these two. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nBut while the doors looked old school, nothing about them was dated. At lyf, guests can open their room doors with digital keys on a mobile app.\n\ncaption Key cards are also available for those who prefer them. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nIf you choose to stay in one of the smaller rooms, this is what likely will greet you when you first open the door.\n\nThis is the \u201cUp and Down\u201d room for two people, which costs around S$170++ a night.\n\ncaption The toilet cubicle and shower are separated on purpose so it doesn\u2019t have to get awkward. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nWhile it measures just 18 sqm, this room doesn\u2019t feel too small for two, thanks to a clever L-shaped bunk bed design.\n\ncaption Plenty of space below the bed to place your bags. The bed on the lower level also doubles-up as a day bed. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nIf you\u2019d rather have just one bed though, you can opt for the \u201clyf Style\u201d, which is also 18 sqm, and comes with a PlayStation in the room.\n\ncaption It has a double bed and also costs around S$170++ a night. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nAlso measuring 18 sqm is the \u201cOne of a Kind\u201d, which has a queen bed, but somehow seems more spacious.\n\ncaption You\u2019ll have to be cool with sleeping really near the sink though. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nTravelling in a group? Not to worry, there are also apartments with multiple bedrooms (2-, 4- and 6-room) at lyf.\n\nThis is a shared bathroom in one of the 4-room apartments.\n\ncaption Double sinks! Rejoice! source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nRooms inside the apartments come with doors that have board games on them.\n\ncaption You\u2019ll have to play standing. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThese apartments come with a small kitchenette and a larger-than-expected fridge. Perfect for those who love to cook.\n\ncaption source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nAlso perfect for those who love to eat, because there\u2019s also a reasonably-sized dining/living area.\n\ncaption An apartment like this one would likely cost from S$290++. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThe biggest apartment comes with six bedrooms.\n\nThis duplex one has a cosy dining and kitchen area which can also be used as a meeting room, thanks to a Samsung Flip interactive smart screen typically used for presentations.\n\nThere are no television sets in any of the rooms at lyf. While this can be a bummer for TV addicts, Teo told Business Insider that apartment guests can cast media from their phones onto the interactive screens provided.\n\nOther guests can stream shows on their mobile devices seamlessly since the property has a minimum standard of 4mbps per room, much higher than in other luxury properties in Singapore, she added.\n\ncaption source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nGuests who prefer not to cook in their rooms can use the social cooking and dining spaces on level 5.\n\ncaption The shared kitchen area is called Bond, and guests can feel free to walk in whenever they feel like cooking up a storm. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThe Bond kitchen is also suitable for cooking classes, which are organised by lyf from time to time.\n\ncaption Workshops and classes organised by lyf are free-of-charge for guests most of the time. The only time lyf guests need to pay for these classes is when there are material costs involved. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThere are shared refrigerators for all guests at lyf to use freely, and also two kitchens reserved for guests who do not eat pork products.\n\ncaption The kitchens are so well-equipped, there is no excuse to eat out when staying here. Also, having such good cooking facilities means guests with strict dietary restrictions can eat with peace of mind. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nJust outside Bond is a social pantry area where guests can mingle and eat their meals.\n\ncaption Bright neon signs add a splash of colour to the walls, making them very Instagrammable. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to get working, guests can use the Connect space back at level 4 at any time at all.\n\ncaption The furniture is modular and guests can rearrange them however they please. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nNeed a meeting room? No problem. Connect has a number of those available.\n\ncaption Guests can just walk in and use any room at any time, but they are advised to make a booking with the lyf guards in advance. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThere is also outdoor seating with a great view of the old Hill Street Fire Station.\n\ncaption source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThe public washrooms on this level are also designed in an Instagram-friendly way.\n\ncaption source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nAnd because many millennials love to keep themselves fit and fab, there is also a small exercise corner with recommended workout instructions.\n\ncaption Not exactly a gym, but good enough for an intense workout. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThere are even yoga mats available if you need.\n\ncaption source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nAnd for those who don\u2019t like working out, these \u201chamster wheels\u201d will give you a good work out while having fun.\n\ncaption It\u2019s harder than it looks. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nWhile there is a very lovely infinity pool that can be viewed from lyf, guests do not have access to it unless they buy a pass from TFX fitness next door.\n\nThose who wish to use TFX\u2019s fully-equipped gym and pool can speak to the lyf guard on duty to find out the rates available to guests at the time.", "description": "Business Insider - The place is incredibly fun, but there are some things lacking.
