That leaves it set for the worst third-quarter performance in nine years.\n\nThe property and construction sectors have been among the hardest-hit. But the malaise extends from technology to telecommunications, retailers, agriculture, education and financial services, as companies contend with unemployment of 29%, weak business confidence and an economy in its longest downward cycle since 1945.\n\nPlatinum miners and gold producers have delivered the flip side to this picture, shining during the quarter as investors swarmed to the haven appeal of precious metals in uncertain times.\n\nThe blockbuster event of the quarter was the carve out by Naspers Ltd., the market\u2019s largest stock, of its $120 billion internet unit Prosus NV for a listing in Amsterdam. Naspers, still 14% of the benchmark, has dropped about 6% since the Sept. 11 separation, weighing on the overall market.\n\nThe immediate outlook isn\u2019t too bright either, judging by at least one technical indicator. Johannesburg stocks are trading below their 50- day and 200-day moving averages. A dip below the 200-day marker, in particular, may signal the beginning of a downtrend to some analysts who use that level to predict future moves.\n\nInvestors with longer-term horizons may regard this as a near-term glitch, given that they have benefited from South African stock outperformance over the past two decades. The main Johannesburg gauge has outpaced emerging-market peers in dollar terms since 1999.\n\nAnd some argue that things may be about to improve, in any case.\n\nJPMorgan Asset Management said it sees some opportunities in emerging markets, as earnings estimates are \u201csufficiently bearish\u201d and price-to-book valuations are lower than average. \u201cHistorically at these valuation levels, investors have been rewarded over the long term,\u201d said Richard Titherington, chief investment officer for emerging market and Asia-Pacific equities at the money manager.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Colleen Goko in Johannesburg at cgoko2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Dana El Baltaji at delbaltaji@bloomberg.net, ;Blaise Robinson at brobinson58@bloomberg.net, John Viljoen\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Worries about global growth, the prolonged trade war and a moribund local economy have stopped South African stocks in their tracks.After posting back-to-back quarterly gains, a feat not achieved since 2017, Johannesburg\u2019s benchmark index is down 5% since the end of June as of Friday.", "authors": ["Colleen Goko"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ka5t.N4KZ5PFhcocxYam5g--~B/aD04NTA7dz0xNDgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/4252562c68ad0fade1ecaa31ea49c139", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
