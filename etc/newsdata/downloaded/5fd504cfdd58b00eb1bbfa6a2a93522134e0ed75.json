In the name of this distinguished revolutionary, let us work tirelessly towards the renewal of our movement.\"\n\nSpeaking at Hani's commemoration on Wednesday SACP general scretary Blade Nzimande said shortly before Hani was killed, he pointed out that there was a danger that the movement would be hijacked by self-serving interests once it ascended to government.\n\nNzimande said in memory of Hani, self-serving interests should therefore be dealt with.\n\n\"The clean-up of the state that we fought for, the clean-up momentum that has started under the leadership of President Cyril Ramaphosa, must now be consolidated and accelerated. The crooks and traitors must go to jail. The billions of rand that have been stolen, the billions that have been illegally exported to Dubai and elsewhere must be returned,\" he said.\n\nRight-wing politician Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder.\n\nTheir death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in November 2000.\n\nWalus was denied parole in January.\n\nThis was because there was contradicting information in psychological reports, that made it difficult to determine whether Walus should be placed on parole, Justice Minister Michael Masutha said at the time.", "description": "The ANC says the death of South African Communist Party general secretary and struggle icon Chris Hani robbed the liberation movement in South Africa of one of its best cadres.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7242/d87c1728130e46ff9db2e448bbbe2b39.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-10"}
