Talks with WBO champion Oscar Valdez were at an advanced stage before the Mexican decided to vacate his title and move up in weight. WBA holder Leo Santa Cruz then did the same. That left WBC champion Gary Russell Jr.\n\nTakoucht is not who Warrington was hoping for (Picture: Reuters)\n\nBut Russel Jr fights just once a year and had beaten Kiko Martinez in May.\n\n\u2018After the fight with Kid Galahad I went away on holiday and I told my manager I expected good news when I got back,\u2019 Warrington told Metro.co.uk. \u2018We had a meeting with Frank [Warren] and it looked positive \u2013 until we got there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Frank had to break the news the other champions didn\u2019t want the fight. I was more or less begging him to use his powers and reputation to make it happen.\n\n\u2018He said he would keep on trying and he did deliver me a world title at Elland Road. He promised me in 2020 I will get my shot at another world title. I\u2019ve put my trust and faith in him.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got to win my next fight to keep that dream alive.\u2019\n\nThe path of a modern world champion is often paved with broken promises. Fighters\u2019 records are stacked as matter of necessity in the age of pay-per-view stars. A super-fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao took over half a decade to put together. By 2015, it was long past it\u2019s best-before date.\n\nIn boxing the longer you are world champion, the more you get paid. Politics and financial agendas rule the sport and as a result, unification fights are sold to the fans as a luxury.\n\nWarrington fears ending his career with regrets (Picture: Reuters)\n\nRussell Jr has fought once a year since claiming the WBC belt in 2015. None of those fights have been unification clashes. He\u2019s exactly the kind of champion Warrington doesn\u2019t want to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe explained: \u2018I\u2019ve told Frank I don\u2019t ever want to be a long-reigning world champion if I never fight another champion.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not about that. Give me the big fights and I\u2019ll test myself. I\u2019ll be satisfied when I win another belt. I might even consider my options if things continue as they are.\n\n\u2018There could be bigger challenges in the division above. But right now, I\u2019m desperate to fight for another world title.\u2019\n\nAfter beating Galahad, Warrington declared to his Leeds faithful an away trip to America was next. For a man who still hand delivers tickets to his most loyal fans, breaking that promise felt like a betrayal.\n\nWarren intends for Warrington to return to Leeds United\u2019s Elland Road next summer. Warrington, though, says he cannot fight at such hallowed ground if it is not a unification fight.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t go to Elland Road without a big fight,\u2019 he insisted. \u2018I promised my fans we would be going to the States and maybe I got carried away with myself, but I thought after I beat Galahad there was no-one left for me to fight here.\n\nSupremely talented Russell Jr fights just once a year (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve done the Leeds Arena and Manchester Arena multiple times. I thought I\u2019d be broadening my popularity worldwide and that\u2019s what I promised my fans. That didn\u2019t happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If I\u2019m going to Elland Road next year it has to be a big fight. Last time I was fighting Lee Selby for a world title. It can\u2019t be a simple defence.\n\n\u2018It has to be a meaningful fight, I owe that to myself and my fans.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to be a world champion who strings out their reign. I don\u2019t want defences after defences.\n\nWarrington is set for a return to Elland Road next year (Picture: Reuters)\n\n\u2018I want to test myself every time I get into the ring, hopefully you end up at the top of the tree, but I want the fights regardless.\n\n\u2018The world doesn\u2019t end if you come up short. My fans expect me to fight the best. That\u2019s what I expect of myself.\u2019\n\nAt the moment, it is unclear who Warrington might fight at Elland Road. It could be Russel Jr, but there are now two vacant titles in the division. There could be two newly minted champions by the summer of 2020 completely disinterested in staging their first defence against an established rival.\n\nWarrington might be forced to move up in weight (Picture: Getty)\n\nWarrington may be made to wait or forced to move up in weight, but even at 28, the IBF champion insists the clock is ticking.\n\n\u2018If we get to this time next year and I\u2019m still waiting for a unification fight\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Maybe I\u2019d have to change my whole persona. Get nasty on social media, but that\u2019s never been my style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Lots of people tell me I should do that more often and turn up at fights. I pay a manager to sort the fights out and I have a promoter.\n\n\u2018But eventually, you become desperate because we\u2019re not boxers forever. You have a small window to get the big fights.\u2019\n\nTickets for Warrington vs Takoucht on Saturday Oct 12th are available via Ticketmaster.co.uk", "description": "Josh Warrington has cut a somewhat frustrated figure in the build-up to the third defence of his IBF world title this weekend.
