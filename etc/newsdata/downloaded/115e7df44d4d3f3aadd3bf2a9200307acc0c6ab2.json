This subspecies has the ability to let their blood sugar level drop so low, they let themselves turn into the most terrible, aggressive, and angriest version of their beautiful selves. All because they forgot to eat. When it happens, watch out. In their hypoglycemic state, however, these mutants can produce some of the best work of their lives. While the Apple Watch supposedly birthed out of this notion\u2014tireless brainstorming sessions spanned across many nights resulting in supreme creativity\u2014the question remains: Were the Apple Watch creators hangry when the light bulb went off?\n\nKnown as hangry\u2014hungry + angry combined into one word\u2014edging on hunger is an art. It is also a form of self-mutilation and ecstasy all in the name of creativity, productivity, and efficiency. The workplace is the battlefield for these people (and as for their dating or married life, they should eat before they leave work). In the job setting, however, this community has avoided calories all morning, slammed two caf\u00e9s while their empty stomachs trigger their brains to release the hunger hormone ghrelin, putting them on the brink of detonation. Then it happens: Somebody has a work-related question\u2014human interaction. Kaboom.\n\nPhysiologically speaking, the brain, organs, and cells of a hangry person scream for any form of a fast-acting sugar fix when their stomach runs on empty\u2014a cronut, a ripe banana, or even a sugar packet will do\u2014so the body can access the trouble-free version of energy it needs: glucose. If all else fails, the body will use fat\u2014known as ketosis\u2014as coal for the furnace, but if no fat reserves are available, the body will use protein to keep alive, which means hangry people can lose the Popeye muscles they worked so hard building in CrossFit.", "description": "Don\u2019t make yourself \u201changry.\u201d No one likes you when you\u2019re \u201changry.\u201d But you\u2019ll get a lot done.", "authors": ["Johnny Adamic"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492182165/articles/2015/04/11/hangry-is-hunger-for-privileged-people/150410-adamic-hangry-tease_lezfwi", "published_at": "2015-04-11"}
