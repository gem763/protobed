Eight of the ten municipalities which took in the most migrants per population in 2015 also have unemployment rates far above the national average, Aftonbladet reports.\n\nThe municipality of Ljusnarsberg took in the most migrants per population, 230 per 1,000 people, and currently has an unemployment rate of over ten per cent.\n\nProfessor and economist Per Lundborg said the solution to the problem is to create more jobs that do not require large amounts of training or education.\n\nAfter Years of Open Borders, Sweden Unemployment Rate Approaches Highest in EU https://t.co/z8vGVHDZzh \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 2, 2019\n\n\u201cSweden is one of the most high-tech countries in the world, where we streamline simpler jobs. Therefore, the knowledge gap is too large for many of the refugee immigrants who come here,\u201d Lundborg noted.\n\n\u201cSweden is a high-cost country. It is expensive to live here. If you then have a group that does not meet their living expenses through the work they do, they must still go to the society for help with their livelihood,\u201d he added.\n\nThe figures come only days after the European Union statistics agency Eurostat revealed that Sweden was now 24th out of 28 member states in terms of unemployment.\n\nFigures released last year showed a stark contrast between the native Swedish unemployment rate and the foreign-born unemployment rate. As a result, many municipalities which took in a high number of asylum seekers in 2015 have recently announced major financial troubles, some on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nGermany, which took in the most asylum seekers during the 2015 crisis, has seen similar problems getting migrants into work. A 2017 report claimed that the district of Salzlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt had a migrant unemployment rate of 96.3 per cent.\n\nGermany: No \u2018Economic Miracle\u2019 as 65 Percent of Refugees Still Jobless https://t.co/Jo4MRY9IHL \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 31, 2019", "description": "Ninety per cent of asylum seekers who came to Sweden at the height of the migrant crisis and have gained permanent residency are unemployed.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/12/GettyImages-498032036.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
