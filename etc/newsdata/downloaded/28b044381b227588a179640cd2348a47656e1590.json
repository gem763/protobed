Holding an international summit of world leaders at the president\u2019s resort is not just a conflict of interest, it is unconstitutional,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat.\n\nMr. Trump promoted his club during the G-7 meetings in France two months ago, saying the resort was \u201ca natural\u201d for the 2020 summit because it is close to the Miami airport and each country can have a separate bungalow.\n\nDemocrats are investigating that promotion, saying it\u2019s the first time foreign nations have been asked to interact with Mr. Trump\u2019s business to negotiate with the U.S.\n\nThey said the White House\u2019s decision to select Mr. Trump\u2019s property is infuriating.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s announcement that President Trump\u2019s Doral Miami resort will be the site of the next G-7 summit is among the most brazen examples yet of the president\u2019s corruption,\u201d said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler. \u201cHe is exploiting his office and making official U.S. government decisions for his personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nThe House this year approved spending bills that included language banning the government from hosting the G-7 summit at Trump properties.\n\nThe Senate has not acted on those bills, but House Democrats said they\u2019ll insist on the prohibition in any final legislation, saying Republicans will have to \u201cchoose whether to stand up to this blatant corruption or once again allow President Trump to violate basic norms and profit off the presidency.\u201d\n\nBut forcing that fight could break an agreement House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Trump struck in July, where they settled on a two-year budget and agreed to a cease-fire on any new legislative riders.\n\nMr. Trump has maintained ownership of his business empire after becoming president, though he turned over day-to-day operations to his children.\n\nInvestigations by press outlets have found foreign governments have poured money into his properties since he took office. And Attorney General William Barr has scheduled his annual Christmas party for the Trump hotel in downtown Washington this year.\n\nThose sorts of moves have spawned lawsuits arguing the payments are emoluments, violating the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on profiting from the presidency.\n\n\u201cThe Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution exist to prevent exactly this kind of corruption,\u201d Mr. Nadler said in his statement Thursday.\n\nHe said his panel will \u201ccontinue investigating, litigating and legislating\u201d on the issue, but won\u2019t let it distract from an ongoing impeachment inquiry regarding Ukraine and the 2020 election.\n\nMr. Mulvaney said the Doral will host the event \u201cat cost\u201d and will not profit from the event. He also noted that Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t take a salary.\n\nHe insisted the site was the best place for the event and practically created for the G-7, contrasting it with limitation as places such as Camp David in Maryland.\n\n\u201cSome places don\u2019t have the transportation that you need,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cThere\u2019s limitations at other places.\u201d\n\nMr. Mulvaney said the G-7 hasn\u2019t been held at Doral before because no one looked at it.\n\nMr. Trump was the first person to float the idea, Mr. Mulvaney said, recalling a meeting with advanced planners when he threw Doral into the mix. The chief of staff said aides viewed it as a decent idea.\n\nMr. Trump is thumbing his nose at Democrats in the middle of an impeachment inquiry over his interactions with Ukraine. The inquiry centers on Mr. Trump\u2019s push to paint former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter as corrupt for allegedly allowing official business to bleed into business interests.\n\nMr. Mulvaney batted away claims that Mr. Trump can no longer make that case. He also said the White House \u201clooks forward to participating in\u201d the Democrats\u2019 investigation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
