(Jim Havard/Flickr)\n\nToday was rather summery for what is considered by many the first unofficial day of fall. The astronomical calendar is having a laugh today, given highs approaching 90 in spots. And it\u2019s only a preview of things to come. Nineties seem close to assured Wednesday.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: It\u2019s a pleasant evening, if on the warm side. Temperatures are falling into and through the 70s around sunset. Under mostly clear to partly cloudy skies, lows end up ranging from the mid-60s to low 70s. Humidity is moderately high, so you\u2019ll feel it if you\u2019re out there. Winds are light and variable after dark.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Wednesday): Skies are mixed, with periods of clouds and others of sun. It\u2019s probably a bit hazier than today, as well. Highs are mainly near 90 and into the low 90s. Probably one of the last 90-degree days, but will it be the last? While that\u2019s to be determined, there is a lot of certainty that humidity is bordering on high. This should send heat indexes into the mid-90s or even the upper 90s. Winds are out of the south-southwest around 10 mph.\n\n\n\nStorm outlook for Wednesday. (Storm Prediction Center)\n\nScattered storms may develop late in the day. Any that do could be intense. The National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center has this area in the southern part of a \u201cmarginal\u201d risk for severe weather, as isolated wind damage is possible from any of the more potent storms. Storms are a risk at any time during the afternoon into evening, but for now it seems that the most widespread threat is focused in the 4-8 p.m. time frame.\n\nSee Matt Rogers\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

Mold spores are also moderate. Other allergens are low.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
