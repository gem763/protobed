Meanwhile the Lib Dems, in their call to revoke article 50, now have to re-examine who they are, since this is neither liberal nor democratic.\"\n\nIt comes after Labour splits were laid bare when Mr Corbyn said he did not \"accept\" or \"agree with\" Mr Watson's insistence that the party should prioritise a fresh Brexit referendum.\n\nThe deputy leader infuriated senior figures by giving a high-profile speech at the same time as Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, where he disagreed with official policy.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
