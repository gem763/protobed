That\u2019s not news, is it? That\u2019s opinion,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nSmith is regarded as one of Fox News\u2019 core news team members and is seen as an unbiased, factual anchor who consistently reports straight news about Trump.\n\nA representative for Fox News did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nWatch the segment above.\n\nRead original story Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson Slaps Back at \u2018Partisan\u2019 Shepard Smith\u2019s Rebuke of His Guest (Video) At TheWrap", "description": "It\u2019s getting more complicated over at Fox News as we move into day three of impeachment inquiry news.On Wednesday night, primetime host Tucker Carlson slapped back at afternoon news anchor Shepard Smith\u2019s rebuke of a guest on Carlson\u2019s Tuesday night show whom Smith had called \u201crepugnant.\u201d \u201cUnlike maybe", "authors": ["Lindsey Ellefson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u.osKDuzvmt0rHlszX4LEQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/b2d1ef62f3ab65238139381234d310ae", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
