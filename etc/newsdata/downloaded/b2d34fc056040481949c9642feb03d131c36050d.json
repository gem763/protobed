While they were, of course, talking about what everyone was wearing, they were also reviewing Jenny McCarthy\u2019s performance as a host of Fox\u2019s pre-Emmys coverage.\n\nPeople asked why McCarthy, a panelist on The Masked Singer who\u2019s previously hosted The View and her own talk show, was hosting at all, because of her public disapproval of vaccinations. They also panned her for appearing to be unprepared for her interviews. But they took particular issue with her exchange with actress Christina Applegate, one of the night\u2019s nominees in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, for her role in Dead to Me.\n\nJenny McCarthy hosts the red carpet show at the Emmy Awards on Sept. 22 at the Microsoft Theater in L.A. (Photo: FOX Image Collection via Getty Images) More\n\nMcCarthy told Applegate that she wanted to be her when she grew up, which was odd because McCarthy, 46, is just one year younger than the 47-year-old Applegate. She also asked Applegate, a TV veteran who\u2019s been nominated for the lead actress in a comedy Emmy twice for Samantha Who? if she had ever been nominated in that category in the past.\n\nIs Jenny McCarthy drunk? She just told Christina Applegate that she grew up watching her on TV and remembered thinking she wanted to be like her when she was older...but...she\u2019s only 1 year younger than Christina.. \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02 Christina seemed annoyed by the whole interview. #Emmys \u2014 Liz (@SAKoffee_Kween) September 22, 2019\n\nJenny McCarthy, age 46, going on and on to Christina Applegate, age 47, about how she watched her when she was growing up and wanted to be her when she \u201cgot old\u201d is grade A, D class bitchery. #Emmys pic.twitter.com/I9j9RrsQfs \u2014 Beth Fox (@foxbeth) September 22, 2019\n\n@JennyMcCarthy to @1capplegate on the Emmy red carpet: \u201cI watched you when I was young and said \u2018I wanna be like her when I\u2019m older!\u2019\u201d They\u2019re 13 months apart. pic.twitter.com/eDs7OPsh1d \u2014 Laura Jenkins (@laurajenx) September 23, 2019\n\nJenny McCarthy is getting people\u2019s #Emmys histories almost as wrong as she got vaccines \u2014 Shalyah Evans (@ShalyahEvans) September 22, 2019\n\nWatching the Red Carpet for the Emmy's and Jenny McCarthy is horrid as an interviewer and did not do her homework on the people she's interviewing. \u2014 Julian Waneck (@Jwaneck) September 22, 2019\n\nChristina Applegate looking like somebody come get me right now standing next to Jenny McCarthy #Emmys2019 pic.twitter.com/FVPyYQtTRJ \u2014 DKT (@darleneturner53) September 22, 2019\n\nJust because Dr. Jenny McCarthy is only one year younger than Christina Applegate doesn't mean it's wrong for Jenny to say she wanted to be Christina when she grows up. It's not wrong to want to grow up... and one day, Jenny still might. #Emmys2019 #VaccinesWork \u2014 Alx Schnoppoulop (@AlxSchnoppoulop) September 23, 2019\n\nUmmm....EXACTLY my thought. Also? She Didn\u2019t know that both Christina AND Michael Douglas have been nominated before RT @amberfi: Jenny McCarthy (age 46) trying to make it sound like she \"grew up\" watching Christina Applegate (age 47) is so shady. #Emmys2019 \u2014 Danielle Smith (@DanielleSmithTV) September 22, 2019\n\nMcCarthy didn\u2019t devote any time to the chatter on social media, or at least she hadn\u2019t mid-way through the show. Understandably, she was busy.\n\nThank you so much for watching! Appreciate the \u2764\ufe0f and support so much. \ud83d\udc83\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc83\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc83\n\nAnd now I sleep. pic.twitter.com/CzunQf6f1E \u2014 Jenny McC-Wahlberg (@JennyMcCarthy) September 23, 2019\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
