Here\u2019s Money Advice From the Pros", "language": "en", "text": "This article is part of the Journal\u2019s \u201cThe New Rules of Money\u201d package about the financial challenges facing young adults.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal asked prominent financiers and leaders how they\u2019d advise young people on money. Here are excerpts of what five of them said.\n\nI think you have to work for money in order to understand its value. My advice to this generation of young adults would be to get started developing their work ethic even before they start their careers. Find a job, work hard and develop a strategy for managing your money\u2014save for the future, invest your time and money in others and in your community, and spend on what makes you happy and healthy.\n\nHank Paulson Photo: Kyle Hilton\n\nHank Paulson, former Secretary of the Treasury\n\nAmong the most important things we\u2019ve tried to communicate to our children is to live in an environmentally and financially sustainable way which helps protect the planet and your economic security in a world where there is almost certain to be unforeseen adversity and risks. That means consuming less and saving and investing more.\n\nApplications to MBA programs across the U.S. are declining. WSJ\u2019s Jason Bellini traveled to Boston University\u2019s Questrom Business School to hear from students who explain why the investment is worth it.\n\nAs young people make decisions about which jobs to pursue, I always tell them that learning is more important than initial compensation. They can\u2019t afford not to learn. They should choose a career that truly fits their skills and interests because, ultimately, they are only going to enjoy something where they can do well and succeed.\n\nWhen it comes to how they spend their money, young adults owe it to themselves to be financially literate, to try to live within their means and never to borrow or invest if they don\u2019t understand the terms. Often the terms are framed in technical jargon, which is difficult to understand and unfortunately there are sometimes unscrupulous lenders who take advantage of trusting people. So, they should insist that terms be explained in plain English.\n\nWhitney Wolfe Herd Photo: Kyle Hilton\n\nWhitney Wolfe Herd, Founder and CEO of Bumble\n\nNever be financially dependent upon anyone else in your life. Don\u2019t rely on a parent, a spouse or a boss. It will only erode your self worth and negatively impact the important relationships in your life. Instead, learn to save money, make money and then you can rule your own world!\n\nAndy Sieg Photo: Kyle Hilton\n\nAndy Sieg, President of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management\n\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news for young adults today. Thanks to longevity, you could live 100 years or more, though unfortunately your longer financial life may begin under a mountain of student debt. Start by mapping out your priorities and create a plan aligned to your financial goals. This is different for everyone. Early on, stick to a budget, and track expenses to identify areas to reduce them. For those with debt, pay off high-interest, non-tax-deductible first such as credit cards, then more aggressively tackle lower-interest debt such as student loans or a mortgage. Also, take advantage of workplace benefits such as a 401(k) and employer match, as well as health savings accounts. Discipline, early planning and guidance can accelerate your journey to financial freedom and help you achieve more life goals.\n\nMy wife and I have been in the financial advice business for decades. Our philosophy is to make sure our 16, 13 and 9-year-old children feel informed about the economy, markets and money, and not intimidated by them. We look for natural opportunities to educate them on these topics so that they understand the world.\n\nMarkets represent opportunity, and it\u2019s never too early to start learning the lifelong benefits of good saving and investing habits. Time is one of their best allies. Regardless of what path they take in their lives, we hope to instill an understanding of and appreciation for what the economy and money has the power to do, for them and for others.\n\nAbigail Johnson Photo: Kyle Hilton\n\nAbigail Johnson, Chief Executive, Fidelity Investments\n\nI\u2019ve passed along the same advice that I was given when I was a kid: be cautious with leverage. What I mean by leverage is buying assets with borrowed money. It\u2019s dangerous and can be financially toxic when people use too much credit card or home equity debt to pay for current consumption. I was taught to have the patience to invest for the long-term and build a portfolio that can withstand market downturns, which also means being responsible with how you\u2019re spending money. I call this having an investor mind-set.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which one of these is most helpful to you? Join the conversation below.\n\nThis means several things, including don\u2019t optimize the easy short-term solution at the expense of a harder and less certain\u2014but more promising\u2014long-term opportunity. It means your investment decision process should be analytical, logical, and grounded in empirical data. Calibrate the risks and know which ones, if not properly addressed, can sink your money plans.\n\nWhen the stock market and real-estate prices are going up, leverage can seem like a sure way to boost returns. But when the bull market eventually stalls, as it always does, then too much debt can quickly overwhelm an individual\u2019s personal finances, just like it does with a company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nI\u2019d encourage this generation to take a long-term view of the stock market and stay appropriately diversified across stocks, bonds, and cash. Pretty boring, I know, but as my Fidelity colleague Peter Lynch says, the most important organ for investing is the stomach, not the brain. Being diversified based on your age, personal circumstances, and tolerance for risk will help you stay the course when market volatility spikes. Asset allocation is still the most important factor in determining the long-term risk and return characteristics of a portfolio.\n\nWhether with money or work, I tell young adults to always have a hunger and intellectual curiosity to learn. When I meet with interns and new hires at Fidelity, I encourage them to think of their career paths as a stream of experiences. Don\u2019t get caught up with trying to get a specific job title, because a title in one company could mean something completely different in another. Instead, focus on obtaining new skills, more education, and new experiences. Always bring your whole self to work and get involved in the communities where you work and live\u2014if you do this, you\u2019ll have a lasting impact and find more meaning in your job.\n\nRead more of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s coverage of the financial challenges facing young adults.\n\nThe personal-finance playbook followed by past generations doesn\u2019t add up for many people the way it used to.
