It asks the court to step in \"to instruct elected officials that freedom of speech means you cannot silence or punish those with whom you disagree.\"\n\nLast week, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution calling the NRA a \"domestic terrorist organization,\" contending the group spreads propaganda that seeks to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence.\n\n\"This action is an assault on all advocacy organizations across the country,\" said William A. Brewer III, the NRA's lawyer. \"There can be no place in our society for this manner of behavior by government officials. Fortunately, the NRA, like all U.S. citizens, is protected by the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe Suit names the San Francisco along with all eleven of the city's supervisors, both individually and in their official capacities and calls the terrorist designation a \"frivolous insult,\" reports CBS San Francisco.\n\nSan Francisco's resolution follows some recent high-profile shootings, including one in Gilroy, California, about 80 miles southeast of San Francisco, where a gunman entered a garlic festival with an AK-style long gun, killing three people and wounding 17 before killing himself. Since that shooting on July 28, there have been at least three mass shootings - in El Paso, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; and in the West Texas towns of Odessa and Midland.\n\nSan Francisco Supervisor Catherine Stefani said she drafted the resolution after the Gilroy shooting, driven in part by the vision of one of those killed while playing in a bouncy house at the festival. Stefani, an attorney who has been involved for years in gun-control organizations, said the thought sickened her. \"I had enough,\" she told The Associated Press.\n\n\"They continue to stand in the way of gun violence reform and people are dying because of it,\" she said.\n\nShe also criticized NRA leadership for how it spends dues from its self-proclaimed 5 million members - a sore point among some gun-rights activists, as well, who believe its longtime CEO, Wayne LaPierre, and some in his inner circle have misspent hundreds of thousands of dollars on such things as expensive clothing, travel, housing and inflated salaries.\n\nStefani told the AP she believes the lawsuit is a \"desperate move by a very desperate organization,\" taking note of those allegations by some NRA members. \"I truly believe their time is up.\"\n\nThe NRA has been battling a number of challenges to its operations in recent months, including an investigation by the attorney general in New York, where its charter was formed, and the attorney general in Washington, D.C., where authorities are questioning whether its operations are in violation of its non-profit status.\n\nThere also have been internal battles over NRA leadership with the group's then-president, Oliver North, and its top lobbyist, Chris Cox, stepping down, giving gun-rights activists pause about the NRA's ability to hold sway in the upcoming 2020 presidential elections.\n\nDemocrat leaders in Congress on Monday urged President Trump, a favorite of the NRA, to push Republicans to agree to expand background checks, and there have been efforts to make it easier to seize firearms at least temporarily from people who are exhibiting mental health issues.\n\nThe NRA would rather go to court than tackle the \"epidemic\" of gun violence in the U.S., said John Cot\u00e9, San Francisco City Attorney's Office spokesperson.\n\n\"The American people would be better served if the NRA stopped trying to get weapons of war into our communities and instead actually did something about gun safety,\" Cot\u00e9 said. \"Common-sense safety measures like universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and restricting high-capacity magazines would be a good start.\"\n\nWayne LaPierre, executive vice president and CEO of the National Rifle Association (NRA), speaking at the NRA annual meeting in Indianapolis on April 26, 2019 Lucas Jackson / REUTERS\n\nLaPierre, the NRA's CEO, vowed to fight the move by city officials, saying in a statement, \"This lawsuit comes with a message to those who attack the NRA: We will never stop fighting for our law-abiding members and their constitutional freedoms. Some politicians forget that all 5 million of us in the NRA stand for freedom and that we believe it is a cause worth fighting for. We will always confront illegal and discriminatory practices against our organization and the millions of members we serve.\"\n\nThe move by city officials has received some pushback from those who believe it amounts to \"virtue signaling.\" An editorial in the Los Angeles Times written by Michael McGough argued that although the NRA should be criticized for blocking efforts to stem gun violence, it's not accurate to label it a \"domestic terrorist organization.\"\n\n\"Police shootings and gun violence understandably inspire strong emotions, and elected officials are no exception. But they need to watch their words, especially when those words are contained in legislation or, in this case, pseudo-legislation,\" McGough wrote.\n\nThe San Francisco resolution also follows steps by corporate America in recent years to cut ties with the NRA and its membership - from Delta Airlines ceasing discounts for NRA members to last week's moves by Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and Albertsons chains all asking customers to not openly carry firearms into their stores.", "description": "Claims city's declaration violates its free speech rights for political reasons; city official calls suit \"desperate move\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/2d1b588e-cf49-437d-97f2-736c64d19a3c/thumbnail/1200x630/7fa303af6b6ba3a8225681406d4ea28b/rtx6tc8t.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
