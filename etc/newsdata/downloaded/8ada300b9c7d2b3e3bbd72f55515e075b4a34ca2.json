This town has got you covered", "language": "en", "text": "When Don and Gina Martin moved to Iowa City from Chicago last year, they didn\u2019t know anyone in their new community.\n\nWhile Gina met people in her graduate program right away, Don still needed to find a job and get connected with other Iowans.\n\nWhat Don needed was someone who knew the community inside and out and could introduce him to like-minded folks; a local connector to jump-start his networking efforts, both professionally and socially.\n\nWhat Don needed was a wingman.\n\nLuckily, the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids region was ready to provide. Thanks to their innovative \u201cwingman\u201d program, Don Martin got paired up with Iowa City resident Leighton Smith, who put them in touch with a local real-estate agent, helped them find a church and shared information about how to join local sports teams. Later, because of his connection to Smith, Don Martin landed a full-time job at a local software company.\n\nThe Martins now feel so comfortable in Iowa City that they\u2019ve decided to buy a house and start a family there. They\u2019re putting down roots, in part because of the immediate connections they made through their wingman.\n\n\u201cMoving to Iowa City, it\u2019s a community of people who want to stay here and live here and raise their family, but they also have that motivation you find in bigger cities,\u201d Don says. \u201cI want to be in a place where it\u2019s still growing, but yet people seem to care about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have really low unemployment \u2014 it\u2019s hovering right around 2.9% \u2014 so we do need more people,\u201d says Kate Moreland, vice president of the Iowa City Area Development Group and director of career development for ICR Iowa, a regional development organization for Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. \u201cOne of our workforce strategies is to attract more talent to the area, but retention is also part of that strategy. If you\u2019re looking to move here or you just moved here, we want to make sure you feel welcome and connected.\u201d\n\nAfter brainstorming with local employers and area residents, they decided to create a semiformal group of people who could welcome new residents to the area and serve as a starting point for finding meaningful friends, hobbies and causes. These so-called \u201csuperconnectors\u201d were already doing this organically, but the program helped give structure to their work, Moreland says.\n\nTo retain top talent, the region\u2019s leaders knew they had to help newcomers find their tribe \u2014 or, at the very least, give them a head start on finding one.\n\n\u201cWe realized that there\u2019s just a general need when someone is newer to an area to create an early connection,\u201d Moreland said. \u201cYou have about six months before, if people aren\u2019t connected and feel like they\u2019re part of the community, they tend to leave.\u201d\n\nHow it works\n\nApproximately 50 wingmen have gone through some level of training or coaching \u2014 aptly named \u201cflight school\u201d \u2014 in how to make new residents feel at home. After training, each wingman writes up a bio, which gets posted on the program\u2019s website, much like a dating service.\n\nWhen a person moves to the area, they can scour the various profiles to find someone with shared interests or a similar background. When a new resident finds someone they\u2019d like to connect with, they can click on the wingman\u2019s profile to send an introductory email.\n\nRead: Which are the least tax-friendly states in America? California doesn\u2019t crack the top 10, but Illinois sure does\n\nFrom there, the relationship unfolds however the two people decide \u2014 it can be as casual or as serious as they like. Some pairs become close friends, while others benefit from simply meeting once and being connected on LinkedIn.\n\nIf possible, the wingman is expected to meet the new resident in person, invite them to a few events and connect them to at least three additional people in the area, Moreland says.\n\n\u201cWe know this might not fit everyone\u2019s personality, but we want it to be a resource for those who are looking for that early connection and are either struggling or just moved here and are open to meeting new people,\u201d Moreland says\n\nAs was the case for Don Martin, it\u2019s often the spouses or partners of new residents who benefit most from the wingman program. Because the program is growing organically and is not overseen by any one organization, there\u2019s no hard data on how many people have connected with a wingman, but Moreland estimates that number to be about 50.\n\nAlso see: This is what it\u2019s like for these people who got paid $10,000 to move to Tulsa\n\nTo grow the wingman program even further, Moreland says she hopes the newly created ICR Iowa regional organization can put some marketing and outreach muscle behind it. She hopes to spread the word to more area employers, who can pass information about the program along to new employees during orientation.\n\nWhy you should call Iowa home\n\nSo, looking for a new place to call home? You might consider Iowa City or Cedar Rapids, where you\u2019ll find a friendly face waiting for you as soon as you arrive (plus tons of other perks).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re big, small towns,\u201d Moreland says of Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. \u201cWe have a lot of great arts and culture, we have great sports. But overall you can build a life here and there\u2019s a lot of ease to it. A lot of places have great things to do but with traffic and other issues, you don\u2019t necessarily take advantage of them. Everything\u2019s accessible here.\u201d", "description": "Thanks to an innovative program, newcomers to Iowa City get help making connections.", "authors": ["Sarah Kuta"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS709_Liv_io_MG_20191004150332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
