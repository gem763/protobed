Democrats are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn't be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,' he said.", "description": "The whistleblower who blew the lid on Trump's phone call with Ukrainian president wrote a personal memo the day after the July 25 call.", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/03/19423630-0-image-a-21_1570502964244.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
