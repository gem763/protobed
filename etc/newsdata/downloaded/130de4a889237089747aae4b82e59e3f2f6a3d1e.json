For some more specific help, I\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nThere\u2019s A Best Way To Manage Your Inventory\n\nWhen you\u2019re carrying too heavy a load in The Outer Worlds, you\u2019ll become \u201cencumbered,\u201d meaning you can\u2019t sprint or fast travel. It\u2019s pretty easy to sell the things you don\u2019t need, but you should also consider breaking down weapons and armour you don\u2019t need for parts. In general, when you level up is a good time to go over what you\u2019re wearing and get rid of underpowered stuff. You can do this in your inventory, or using a workbench\u2014there\u2019s a really convenient one located in your ship. Using the workbench will earn you more weapon or armour parts than doing it from your inventory, and if you have a high enough engineering skill, the workbench will sometimes yield a weapon mod or armour mod.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what to break down or what to sell, you can use the sorting tools in your inventory screen to help you decide. You can sort by value, weight, type, or even the value to weight ratio of your items item.\n\nA Lot Of Things Affect Your Stats, So Pay Attention\n\nA lot of things can change your stats other than levelling up. Your armour, weapon mods, and even the companions you have with you have an effect on your player character\u2019s stats, opening (and closing) new avenues of play. It can be a real bummer to try to hack a terminal only to realise that you\u2019re one point shy of being able to, so make sure to check out what is influencing your stats before you embark on a quest. In some quests, the quest giver will straight up tell you what kind of skills you\u2019ll need, but others require an educated guess. The first story quest on Monarch involves going through a lot of dangerous terrain, and many people warn you that it\u2019s full of monsters. Nyoka, who has a perk that allows her to do more damage to monsters, is a pretty safe bet for that quest.\n\nYou can look at your stats in the menu screen, scrolling over to \u201cCharacter\u201d and then selecting \u201cSkills.\u201d The number to the left is the baseline, and the number to the right in parentheses is based on changes made by your gear and companions. If you want a breakdown of what is changing your stats, scroll over again to \u201cSummary,\u201d which will show you the details.\n\nFlaws And You\n\nFlaws are triggered by the ways that you suck at the game, giving you a permanent debuff in the relevant area. They also give you an extra perk point for your trouble. Get hit by plasma damage too many times? If you take on the associated flaw, you\u2019ll have an extra perk but also take 25% more damage from plasma. That\u2019s not an insignificant amount.\n\nWhen you\u2019re considering a flaw, take into account what you\u2019re going to be doing for the next few hours of gameplay. When I kept getting my arse beat by acid-spitting raptidons on Monarch, I opted not to take the flaw for it, because I knew I was probably going to run into a lot of raptidons. I did take the plasma damage flaw, however, because it came from playing sloppily when it came to the robotic automechanicals, who shoot plasma at you. I wanted to challenge myself to take down automechs more efficiently, and also I wanted the perk that allowed me to fast travel when encumbered. It all worked out in the end.\n\nBoss Your Companions Around, And Don\u2019t Forget To Tell Them To Chill Sometimes\n\nWhen it comes to combat, your companions are a huge boon\u2014or at least a handy damage sponge. If they\u2019re not helping you out as much as you want to, pay attention to the companion commands and also their designated behaviour.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve found very helpful is telling my companions to follow me if they\u2019re trapped in a bottleneck, which is a really easy way to end up with two dead companions. Hold the arrow button in the lower left corner of the screen to have your companions run toward you, allowing you to regroup. Don\u2019t forget about using companion special abilities, either, which have your companion say a fun quip and then use a special attack that does more damage. You can also use companion commands to tell your companions to focus on a particular enemy. Later in the game you\u2019ll meet a lot of enemies with Shock Cannons, huge guns that electrocute and kill you very quickly, and ordering your companions to get these dudes off your back will be very helpful.\n\nIn the menu screen, you can also adjust your companions\u2019 behaviour. By default, they\u2019re all set to use both ranged and melee weapons, follow you at a medium distance, and be aggressive. By going to your companion\u2019s name in the menu screen, then going to the last screen in that sub menu, you can adjust all three behaviours. While mixed weapons, medium follow distance, and being aggressive will do just fine for most of the game, there are some situations where it\u2019ll cause your companions to just totally ruin your plans, especially if you\u2019re trying to be stealthy. Nothing like a companion leaving cover to take a swipe at an enemy that has wandered over to the patch of grass you\u2019re hiding in, thereby alerting all the rest of the enemies.\n\nHack The Planet\n\nI wish I had known how useful hacking and lockpicking would be on my first playthrough. There have been many times when files on a terminal or a locked door or chest were closed off to me because I didn\u2019t have a high enough hacking or lockpicking skill. Having a high lockpicking skill can also unlock a lot of alternate routes for completing quests, especially near the end of the game.\n\nIt also helps that hacking and lockpicking are both pretty streamlined. There are no minigames, thank goodness. Your ability to hack a terminal is determined by your hacking skill, and you\u2019ll also need a bypass shunt in your inventory to complete the hack. For lockpicking, your skill level determines if you can unlock a door, how many mag-picks you\u2019ll need, and how long it will take. At a high enough level, you won\u2019t need any mag picks and it\u2019ll only take a second to unlock a door, which can make being stealthy a walk in the park.\n\nSmooth Talker\n\nHaving high dialogue skills also helps you in combat. The Lie, Persuade, and Intimidate skills can all trigger Dialogue Skills in combat. For instance, if your intimidate skill is high enough, after you shoot an enemy they may cower in fear, allowing you to keep shooting them until they\u2019re dead. How sweet!\n\nWhen you\u2019re talking to a merchant or using a vending machine, your highest dialogue skill will also factor into getting you a discount. Wish I had that one in the real world.\n\nEat, Drink, And Be Merry\n\nYou can use consumables to temporarily give yourself a boost. Given that The Outer Worlds takes place in a society completely controlled by various brands, there\u2019s dozens of different versions of each kind of consumable. While some of them have different stats, for the most part, you can just memorise what kind of effect an item will have based on its type.\n\nSugary drinks raise your body related skills, and caffeinated drinks raise your mind related skills, so grab a Lemon Slap for combat and a Trip Teaz for hacking. Alcoholic drinks will raise your dialogue skills but come with a hangover that lowers your perception. Cigarettes will reduce your weapon sway, but a nicotine low will make your aim more worse. Consumable foods usually affect your health; carbohydrates increase your health generation, and meat increases your maximum health.\n\nLet\u2019s See That Pretty Face\n\nYou definitely should give your companions a helmet, but boy howdy is some of the equipment ugly. If you\u2019d prefer to see everyone\u2019s beautiful faces, you can turn off helmet visibility in the setting menu. Go to Gameplay, and uncheck the box that\u2019s just below the game difficulty. It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s pretty nice not to feel like you\u2019re being followed around by a bunch of Darth Vaders.", "description": "The Outer Worlds is out today, and while it\u2019s easy to be wowed by Halcyon, you might need a couple tips to make the most of your time there.", "authors": ["Alex Walker", "Gita Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/m5knnxv2zehincv5mwhu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
