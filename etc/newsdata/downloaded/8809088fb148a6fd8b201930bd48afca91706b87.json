They obviously saw the big car and because Sead had just handed me something, they must have noticed he was wearing an expensive watch.'\n\n'They told him directly, \"Give us your watch!\". Sead\u2019s reaction was really, really brave because he attacked one of the attackers. The second one was in front of my car on his moped so I couldn\u2019t drive.'\n\nOzil admitted he was scared for his wife's safety and that of his team mate.
