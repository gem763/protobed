Happy freakin\u2019 Wednesday.\u201d\n\nThe teacher captioned the footage, \u201cOne student created an unsafe bus environment for my class, so guess who had to stay back with an unruly child while the rest of the class goes on a field trip.\u201d\n\nVideo: Teacher Resigns, Threatened to Shoot Up School\n\nShe also wrote, \u201cAlso didn\u2019t pack a lunch today because I thought I\u2019d be eating pizza with the class. Send food, send patience.\u201d The woman reportedly added, \"Be a teacher they said. It will be fun, they said.\"\n\nParents in the district are angry that she posted it to her social media account.\n\n\"It\u2019s disappointing. As an educator, the job is to encourage and uplift children. To post that online, I don\u2019t find it encouraging at all,\" parent Geoff Stafford told WCNC.\n\n\"If she doesn't enjoy her job and she doesn't enjoy being a teacher, maybe she should find something else to do,\u201d Shannon Myers told WCNC.\n\nDistrict spokesperson Tanae Sump-McLean tells Yahoo Lifestyle that the teacher resigned on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe teacher who posted the video to social media voluntarily resigned her position with the Mooresville Graded Schools this morning, August 30, 2019,\u201d she said via email. \u201cBy law, the school board cannot comment on any specific employee matters. However, it is important for parents and the community to understand that anytime a question arises regarding the conduct of a school employee specific to their job, the Superintendent and school administrators work diligently to ensure the best possible outcome for our students.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The teacher posted the cruel video on Instagram Stories, upset to miss out on a field trip.", "authors": ["Tanya Edwards"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TcVypX5bCQ0yu01ssn4dVw--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/0ccdfbc0-cc1b-11e9-8f9f-7d9cd9085d8a"}
