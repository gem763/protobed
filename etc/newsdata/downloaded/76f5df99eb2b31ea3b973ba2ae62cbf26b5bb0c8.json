We\u2019re talking about a small amount of troops that will move to other bases within Syria,\u201d the official noted.\n\nThe White House arranged for an official to brief reporters in a call after Republicans in the foreign policy establishment universally condemned Trump\u2019s decision, announced on Sunday night and promoted on Twitter on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cI held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was informed of the upcoming operation by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Sunday night, prompting his announcement that he was moving about 50 American operatives away from the potential conflict zone.\n\nThe official was adamant that Trump\u2019s troop movements were not \u201cgreen lighting\u201d or endorsing the Turkish military campaign against the Kurdish PKK forces.\n\n\u201cThe president made it very clear publicly and privately that the United States does not endorse or support any Turkish operation in Northern Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe criticized a New York Times headline that said that Trump had \u201cendorsed\u201d the operation, noting that it was \u201cirresponsible and doesn\u2019t comport with the reality of the situation.\u201d\n\nThe official said that the president ultimately wanted to move troops out of Syria, but that he was not doing it at the moment.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for any such move right now, we\u2019re moving 50 troops within Syria,\u201d he said.", "description": "A Senior White House official clarified that President Donald Trump was not immediately withdrawing troops from Syria.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/American-Soldier-in-Syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
