He has been called upon by thousands of farmers across New South Wales and beyond to repair and install windmills for the past 30 years. He calls himself a windmill mechanic and estimates he has climbed more than 10,000 windmills during his career. Windmills were originally used to mill grain or pump groundwater and have become an iconic part of the Australian rural landscape. But with the use of new technologies they are fast becoming obsolete. \u2018They are all becoming fairly old, with new windmills available but not a lot being put up,\u2019 Tydd said. \u2018The thought pattern at present is if you want to put something new in to pump water, you either put in an electric submersible pump or a solar pump. And because I am just about to retire, I am not going to argue about that. I\u2019m going to convince people to put in solar pumps to save me from being asked to climb their windmills\u2019", "description": "Windmills may be an iconic part of Australia\u2019s rural landscape, but Owen Tydd says they are becoming obsolete", "authors": ["Photograph", "David Gray Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c15048ce6e4069440c6ad62aad36a65ee90e2b2a/0_125_3959_2376/master/3959.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2c2259d9a6a29ae73635498819366e36", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
