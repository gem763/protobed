(Success vibes. That's a thing, right?)\n\nAnyway, nothing helps get you ready to bake like the right baking tunes. We asked the bakers of The Great Canadian Baking Show Season 3 for their baking soundtrack. Here's what they gave us.\n\nLiam\n\nSometimes I listen to Katy Perry while I bake because she has great inspirational songs, and it's catchy and you can have a little dance party while you listen to it. Or, I can't remember [the artist] but I listen to Fight Song a lot.\n\nMary Lou\n\nLeonard Cohen or U2. I love Leonard Cohen. Or did. Still do.\n\nJasmine\n\nMy baking soundtrack is probably a lot of jazz music.\n\nJay\n\nI listen to a lot of things from the '70s and '80s.\n\nBetty\n\nMyself.\n\nBaking music is important. This guy gets it. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAndrea\n\nToday's top hits. Something very upbeat and very energetic that just gets me going and moving and dancing.\n\nChris\n\nWhen I'm baking I especially enjoy listening to the Final Fantasy soundtracks. They never fail to get me pumped up.\n\nJodi\n\nClassical music. I have a huge thing for Vivaldi, Rights of Spring.\n\nNataliia\n\nWhen I'm baking I like to listen to pop music.\n\nColin\n\nThere's a musical about baking called Waitress, and I listen to that soundtrack while I bake.\n\nNeed some baking music? Here's a playlist inspired by our bakers' choices.", "description": "The bakers of Season 3 share their kitchen soundtracks", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5329304.1571689417!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/984999710.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
