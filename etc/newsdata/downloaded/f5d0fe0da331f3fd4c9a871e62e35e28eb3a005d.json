I souped it on one. I hit a quick hook in the bunker on two. Three-putt on three. Next you know, if I don't get it going here it's going to start snowing on me, so I had to turn it around.\n\n'I spoke to Joey and we had to suck it up and let's turn it to even par at the turn and lo and behold I got on a quick little run on 14, 15, 16, hit two really good shots on 18 \u2013 all of a sudden I am one under and I'm like that's a bonus.'\n\nHe was also aided by a lucky bounce at his final hole, the par-four ninth, where he slammed his driver into the ground in frustration after carving his tee shot way right.\n\nBut he had a bashful smile on his face a few seconds later after his ball hit a tree and ricocheted back towards the fairway.\n\nHe made the most of his reprieve. From 194 yards, he took direct aim at the pin and hoisted an eight iron that landed a few feet in front of the hole, setting up a closing birdie.\n\nWoods added: 'I was really p***** after that start because I have been swinging better than that, I had been feeling better than that, but I just thought let's re-set and get going here, aim for even par at the turn. Just figure out how to get to even par at the turn somehow.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Ninth birdie of the day\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Opening round 64\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Leader by two pic.twitter.com/be3VWPKnzb \u2014 GOLFTV (@GOLFTV) October 24, 2019\n\nThe American bogeyed the first three holes of his opening round before hitting nine birdies\n\n'I had a nine iron into 13 off a little par three and I hit a really good shot flat over the top of the flag and I hit a good putt. That was something to build on, let's continue to build on because I had given myself looks. I had been putting well coming into this event at home.\n\n'Next you know I am hitting the ball within that 10-15 foot range when you hope you can make a few but I made them all. Every single one apart from one at seven. I never asked Joey for a read because every putt I see was moving away from me.\n\n'I am very happy because it could have been one of them rounds that shot me out of the tournament. Turning around a round that could have shot me out of the tournament feels that much better. It got me into the lead.'\n\nA sell-out gallery crowd of 17,000 followed Tiger at the Narashino County Club in Inzai\n\nAre you serious? \ud83d\ude32@TigerWoods has taken the outright lead. \ud83d\ude33\n\n\n\nHe's made EIGHT birdies in his last 12 holes. \ud83d\ude4c#LiveUnderPar pic.twitter.com/TTztLxrxyY \u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) October 24, 2019\n\nIt was by far the most impressive performance by the 43-year-old American since he ended a 10-year major drought by winning the Masters in April.\n\nHis season petered out after that amid a psychological letdown and a worsening left knee, and he was not a factor in the other three majors.\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the season-ending Tour Championship, he had the knee procedure in August which he had long postponed.\n\nThe Zozo Championship, the first official-money event in Japan, will be his final event before he, as captain of the US Presidents Cup team, must select four players to complete his line-up for December's event in Australia.\n\nHis form on Thursday can only strengthen the case to be a playing captain.\n\nHis 64 was his best score since he carded 62 in the first round of the BMW Championship in September of last year.\n\n'This is how I've been hitting it at home, so that (64) wasn't a real big surprise,' he said.\n\nThe opening round on Thursday was played in fine if cloudy weather, but a forecast for torrential rain on Friday has players wondering how much competition will be possible before the course becomes unplayable.", "description": "Tiger Woods returned to competition in style, shooting his best score in more than a year to take the lead with a spectacular six-under-par 64 in the opening round at the Zozo Championship.", "authors": ["Andrew Both"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/06/20117066-0-image-a-20_1571895516271.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
