Now the biggest selling band of the 21st Century, they are releasing a record where they feel at ease to speak \"completely freely and let all the colours come through\", says Chris.\n\nThe album has been rumoured to show off their 'experimental side' and Annie commented how: \"One of the things that struck me is that I can hear you more in the album than I've ever heard before - your visceral feelings\".\n\nChris revealed how their Head Full of Dreams tour was a turning point: \"There was something about our last tour that just made me at peace with speaking openly and not minding if people disagree.\"\n\n\"This has been the first time where we have felt like 'oh we\u2019ve got to this place as a band, there is really nothing to think about career wise as it were' so you can just speak completely freely and let all the colours of your own life come through.\"\n\n\"Some of it's very personal about real things in my life,\" he says. \"Some of it's about things that we see. Some of it\u2019s about trying to empathise with what other people are going through, because it seems to me one of things that might help people have a better time is to put themselves in other people\u2019s shoes rather than judging from afar.\"\n\nWatch Chris Martin FaceTime Annie Mac below.", "description": "It's their: \u201cReaction to the perceived negativity that\u2019s everywhere\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07rv08v.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
