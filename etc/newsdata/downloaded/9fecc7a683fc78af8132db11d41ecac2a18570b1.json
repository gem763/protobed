It is facing demands for greater Kurdish autonomy from the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), an armed opposition group.\n\nThere have also been frequent clashes in the area between Iranian security forces and Iranian Kurdish militant groups based in neighbouring Iraq, such as the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK), accused by Tehran of having links to Kurdish PKK insurgents in Turkey.
