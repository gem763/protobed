(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The pitching matchups are starting to materialize for the rest of the National League Division Series. The Washington Nationals have announced that, as expected, Max Scherzer will face Hyun-jin Ryu in Game 3 on Sunday. The Los Angeles Dodgers have already firmed up their Game 4 starter, lefty Rich Hill. The Nationals\u2019 Game 4 plans are still up in the air.\n\nThis series promised to be heavily influenced by each team\u2019s stacked rotation. Stephen Strasburg will be on the mound for the Nationals on Friday night, while Clayton Kershaw is starting for the Dodgers. Then the depth of each staff will be tested.\n\nScherzer will be four days removed from an uneven start in the National League wild-card game. The ace gave up three runs on two homers against the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday night. That won\u2019t bode well against a Dodgers team that likes to play long ball and can stuff its lineup with left-handed batters. But Manager Dave Martinez is confident Scherzer will deliver in his most critical start of the year. At that point \u2014 depending how Friday goes \u2014 the Nationals season could very well depend on it.\n\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind,\u201d Martinez said Friday, when asked if he thought Scherzer could still dominate. The 35-year-old lost six weeks this summer to shoulder and back injuries.\n\nMartinez\u2019s assessment came in a pregame interview session that included a few other notes:\n\nAnthony Rendon has been sick, which could explain a noticeable slump at the plate.\n\nThe manager is willing to use both Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson for an inning or more in Game 2. He even floated An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez \u2014 a possible Game 4 starter \u2014 as an option out of a bullpen that got knocked around Thursday night.\n\nAnd he made it official that Scherzer will have the ball once the series returns to Washington. It would be Scherzer\u2019s only start in the best-of-five series. Next, we\u2019ll see if he can make it count.\n\nLINEUPS\n\nNationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nKurt Suzuki C\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nStephen Strasburg P\n\nDodgers\n\nJoc Pederson RF\n\nJustin Turner 3B\n\nA.J.
