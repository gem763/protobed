And like other current and former officials who have testified for the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, McKinley told investigators that he was deeply alarmed at efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals.\n\nThe solicitation of foreign assistance to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and other Trump antagonists \u2014 a campaign spearheaded by the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani \u2014 has been at the center of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nMcKinley was just the latest witness to detail serious concerns about the decision to recall Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whom Trump and Giuliani vehemently criticized. Current and former officials told Congress that they believed Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster was politically motivated.\n\nMcKinley, according to people familiar with his nearly five-hour closed-door testimony, said he resigned in part after learning that Trump blasted Yovanovitch during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. McKinley also said the State Department was not doing enough to shield officials like Yovanovitch from partisan-driven criticisms and pressure.\n\nMcKinley\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nYovanovitch, who is still employed by the State Department, told congressional investigators last week that there was a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d to smear her based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d She also said she believed that she was forced out at Trump\u2019s direction. The dynamic that led to her ouster, she said, was causing \u201cthis nation\u2019s most loyal and talented public servants\u201d to run for the exits.\n\nMcKinley served as ambassador to four countries and has had several postings at U.S. embassies all over the world. He first joined the Foreign Service in 1982 and is highly respected among the diplomatic corps.\n\nA former colleague told POLITICO that McKinley did not work directly on Ukraine-related issues but was concerned that standard diplomatic protocols were being sidelined in favor of a Giuliani-led campaign to discredit top U.S. officials who were unwilling to pursue politically motivated investigations of the president\u2019s political opponents.\n\nFiona Hill, the president\u2019s former top Russia aide on the National Security Council, expressed similar concerns during her testimony on Monday, according to a person who was in the room.\n\nHill told congressional investigators that Giuliani and other officials, including Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, appeared to be circumventing the National Security Council in pursuit of a shadow foreign policy toward Ukraine.\n\nShe also told lawmakers and aides that she met with a National Security Council lawyer at least twice to report her concerns. Hill testified that John Bolton, the national security adviser at the time, advised her to speak with the lawyer, the person in the room for her testimony added.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, George Kent, a top State Department official who oversees U.S. policy in the region, told investigators that he was alarmed at Giuliani\u2019s efforts to persuade Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals, adding that he was also concerned that the president appeared to be listening to Giuliani\u2019s unfounded claims.\n\nAccording to an official working on the impeachment inquiry, McKinley appeared for his testimony voluntarily and was not under subpoena. It was unclear if the State Department sought to prevent him from appearing, as it has done for other witnesses. The Trump administration sought to block or limit the testimonies of Yovanovitch, Hill and Kent \u2014 but all three appeared to defy those orders.", "description": "A former top adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told House impeachment investigators on Wednesday that he abruptly resigned last week because of President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the ousted U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and the State Department\u2019s unwillingness to protect career diplomats from political", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Bfc87bEGDpEQpNaQnyiWJg--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/abef3c7e188a9a321fd72ace5e9c0f87", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
