This lingered for such a long time that no one could be prepared for that.\"\n\nHalpern says his area was one of the few not hit by the storm surge from Dorian. But he says not far away, \"we have friends who had to walk out of their homes in waist high water.\"\n\nHalpern and his wife are without power and without water and haven't figured out a way to travel out of the island.\n\n___\n\n6 p.m.\n\nHurricane Dorian is now pulling away from the northwestern Bahamas and beginning to scrape Florida's east coast with its winds and rain.\n\nForecasters say Dorian was centered at 6 p.m. EDT Tuesday about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east of Melbourne, Florida. It has top sustained winds of 110 mph (175 kph) as a Category 2 hurricane.

It was the most powerful hurricane on record ever to hit the islands. At least five deaths were reported though the full scope of the disaster still remains uncertain.\n\n____\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nSome of the first post-storm images out of Grand Bahama are showing children and elderly people huddled in the shovel of a huge bulldozer as it evacuates them to a safer area.\n\nPractically parking over the Bahamas for a day and a half, Hurricane Dorian pounded the islands and left widespread devastation to thousands of homes earlier this week. Many people were reported trapped in their homes by high waters from what was then an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm.\n\nRescuers began evacuating people late Tuesday using jet skis, boats. They even brought in the large bulldozer, which carried people through deep muddy waters to safety. Many had their heads bowed down by still-heavy wind and rain.\n\n___\n\n5:50 p.m.\n\nUniversal Orlando Resort is closing its theme parks in Florida early for the day because of Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe theme park resort says its two parks, Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure, were shutting as of 6 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nOther theme parks in Orlando had already made plans to close early or not open at all.\n\nSeaWorld was closed Tuesday because of Dorian.

Ron DeSantis expressed some relief that Hurricane Dorian's track changed before hitting the state, but he warned residents near the coast to follow local emergency officials' instructions for evacuations.\n\nDeSantis said that over the last week-and-a-half, Dorian forecasts had potentially all 67 counties in its path and people should stay safe and remain vigilant over the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile in South Carolina, officials say nearly a quarter-million people have evacuated from that state's coast ahead of Dorian.\n\nSecretary of Transportation Christy Hall said Tuesday that a total of 244,000 people have headed South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster's order to leave the state's coast and head inland. That's nearly a third of the total of about 800,000 people officials have said they believed to be in the evacuation zone, which includes the state's entire coast.\n\n___\n\n2:50 p.m.\n\nAir Force Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy told reporters Tuesday it's too early to tell what U.S. military forces may be needed to help the Bahamas, which has suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Dorian .\n\nHe said the hospital ship USNS Comfort is a four or five day sail away and could be used for medical assistance. He said the military is also prepared to provide engineering, transportation and other help to reopen airports and fix the airfields.\n\nO'Shaughnessy says the USS Bataan and its amphibious ready group, with thousands of sailors and Marines aboard, are also off the coast of North Carolina and could be used if needed.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper has already authorized 14 days of support to the Bahamas if needed.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center says slow strengthening is expected before the storm moves inland. It's centered about 160 miles (255 kilometers) east of La Pesca, Mexico, and is moving west near 7 mph (11 kph).\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Transportation is reporting light traffic on the interstate highway being used as a one-way evacuation route for coastal residents fleeing Hurricane Dorian .\n\nState officials Tuesday morning turned all lanes of Interstate 16 into an eastbound route from Savannah on the coast to Dublin about 100 miles (160 kilometers) inland.\n\nThe state DOT said in a news release the route was seeing \"light traffic\" Tuesday afternoon and cars were \"running at the speed limit.\"\n\nThe agency urged coastal residents to evacuate before traffic on I-16 increased. Forecasters expect Dorian to approach coastal Georgia on Wednesday, most likely with the storm's center staying offshore.\n\nGeorgia Gov.

Roughly 540,000 people live in the state's six coastal counties.\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nOfficials in the South Carolina city of Charleston are mulling putting a prohibition on price gouging info effect as residents continue to evacuate the coast ahead of Hurricane Dorian .\n\nCity officials said they would meet later Tuesday to consider two emergency ordinances designed to prohibit price gouging and enable emergency road closures.\n\nAnti-price gouging measures are often considered to protect motorists scrambling to move inland ahead of storms. Gov. Henry McMaster has ordered evacuations along South Carolina's coast, reversing a major interstate so that all lanes lead inland from Charleston, to accommodate more drivers.\n\nMany areas of Charleston's historic downtown peninsula regularly flood with rising tides, a situation expected to become worse as the storm and its rainfall approach. City officials said they expected tides to increase significantly Wednesday afternoon into Thursday.\n\n___\n\n12 p.m.\n\nOfficials in northeastern Florida are urging people to stay away from the beaches due to possible storm surge from Hurricane Dorian .\n\nFlagler County Emergency Management Director Jonathan Lord said Tuesday that waves of up to 20 feet (6 meters) are expected along the area's Atlantic beaches as the storm moves toward the north.\n\nHe says there can still be \"life-threatening if not deadly conditions at the beach.\"\n\nLord said storm surge is expected along the ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\n___\n\n12 p.m.\n\nTwo Florida men have been arrested for stealing sandbags meant for Hurricane Dorian preparations.\n\nThe Volusia County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that Thaylon Lewis and Joseph Colombo Jr. were arrested Monday evening after a deputy spotted one man taking the sandbags from a highway overpass and the other acting as a lookout.\n\nLewis is charged with theft during a declared state of emergency, a third-degree felony.
