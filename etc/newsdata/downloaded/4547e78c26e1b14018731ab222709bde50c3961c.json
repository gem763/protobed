However, a Mithril spokesperson told Recode that the federal investigation is \"a foiled plot by a self-serving ex-employee.\" An FBI spokesperson declined to confirm or deny that an investigation is ongoing, per FBI policy.\n\nThiel is no longer involved in Mithril's day-to-day operations, but has reportedly given around $300 million of his own money to the firm.\n\nRead more: The life and rise of billionaire investor Peter Thiel, the PayPal cofounder who called Google 'seemingly treasonous,' wants to get injections of young people's blood, and is Trump's biggest Silicon Valley supporter\n\nThe investment firm is run by cofounder Ajay Royan, and reportedly has more than $1.2 billion in assets under management. Former employees and investors told Recode back in February they were concerned that Royan and Mithril were not investing investor money in startups, and were instead sitting on the money.\n\nAt the same time, Royan \u2014 who reportedly told people he has 100% control of Mithril \u2014 has been collecting management fees while investor money remains un-invested. A Thiel spokesperson told Recode earlier this year that he was \"proud\" of Royan's leadership.\n\nMithril is also said to have had issues internally. Several employees, including two managing directors, have reportedly left the company in recent months, and the firm has shrunk to a \"bare-bones\" operation, according to Recode.\n\nAdditionally, investment advisory firm Cambridge Associates is also looking into Mithril over financial \"mismanagement,\" Recode reported. Cambridge Associates has given millions of its clients' funds to Mithril to manage, and clients are reportedly frustrated by Mithril's antics.\n\nThiel is viewed as one of the most successful venture capitalists in the tech industry. He cofounded online-payment giant PayPal and big-data company Palantir. He was one of the earliest investors in Facebook, and now sits on its board. Thiel is also an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump and a critic of left-leaning viewpoints.", "description": "A Mithril spokesperson told Recode that the federal investigation is nothing more than \"a foiled plot by a self-serving ex-employee.\"", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a5cd42e22af18602a73d7-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
