Here's a breakdown on the type of hard drives you can choose from to save your important files. Marc Saltzman, Special to USA TODAY\n\nOwn a computer? Of course you do.\n\nSo, you\u2019ve probably wrestled with how to best protect your important files: Should you pick up an external hard drive or rely on one of the many cloud services available today?\n\nThe best answer? Both.\n\nConsider an online and offline solution \u2013 to back up all the documents, irreplaceable photos, videos, and other files \u2013 as each has distinct benefits and drawbacks. Call it \u201chedging your bets,\u201d to ensure your data remains safe and accessible.\n\nHere's five reasons to get and use an external hard drive, and five reasons to invest in cloud storage, too.\n\nMicrosoft Surface prototypes: An Android Surface 'phone' and dual-screen Windows PC among devices in the works\n\nConsumer Reports: Hidden cable TV fees may cost you $450 extra annually\n\nHard drives: Safe, simple storage\n\nExternal hard drives come in all shapes, sizes and capacities. \u2018Portable\u2019 hard drives such as Western Digital's My Passport (shown here) are smaller and don\u2019t require external power. (Photo: Western Digital)\n\nIt\u2019s offline. Cloud services are online-only, therefore if you don\u2019t have an Internet connection (or if it goes down), you could be without your data. This isn\u2019t the case with an external hard drive, of course. Cloud services require a lot of faith in the fact that you\u2019ll have an \u201calways on\u201d connection, anywhere and anytime \u2013 even while flying the friendly skies.\n\nAmple storage. Rather than only getting a few gigabytes of free storage, per account, external hard drives are measured in terabytes (TB) \u2013 more than 1,000 gigabytes. Some portable drives, like the My Passport from WD (from $79), hold up to 5 terabytes of data. If you\u2019re a digital packrat who downloads and stores a ton of music, movies, TV shows and photos, you\u2019ll need more capacity than what free cloud storage solutions offer.\n\nSafety. While cloud storage protects your data from local threats, like fire or flood, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re home free. It\u2019s not impossible for someone to guess your password to gain entry. And it doesn't mean your data can\u2019t be hacked either. Plus, how well do you trust the company you\u2019re handing your data over to? Do you know what country is housing your files?\n\nMicrosoft, for example, has an online chart showing you where its OneDrive cloud servers are based, so you can see which country your data is stored is in (which might be important for whose who work in fields with strict regulatory compliance).\n\nSome networked hard drives, like SanDisk\u2019s ibi, wirelessly joins your network, and then stores and organizes photos and videos from multiple devices. (Photo: Sandisk)\n\nEasy data backup. While most cloud services offer an auto-backup feature, many hard drives today also have this feature. SanDisk's ibi ($179) smart photo manager, for example, wirelessly backs up and organizes photos and videos stored on computers, smartphones and tablets (via an app), social media accounts, and cloud services, too. Transferring files to a hard drive is also faster than uploading to the cloud.\n\nBang for the buck. Paying as low as $50 for a brand-name 1TB external drive is less expensive than a cloud service over time (and once you stop paying, you\u2019re without your files). Remember, you only need to buy the hard drive once, too. It\u2019s recommended to have a couple of hard drives, in different locations, in case something happens to one of them.\n\nCloud storage: Safe but not at home\n\nOffsite protection. Cloud services \u2013 such as OneDrive, iCloud, Google Drive, and Dropbox \u2013 can protect your data from local threats, such as theft, fire, flood, nasty virus, power surge and hard drive failure. If someone steals your laptop, they might take your hard drive, too, unless you store it elsewhere; a flood or fire could destroy both your computer and hard drive if kept in the same place.\n\nOne of the best cloud deals is Microsoft\u2019s OneDrive, which gives you 1 terabyte per year along with an Office 365 subscription (as low as $69). (Photo: Microsoft)\n\nAnywhere access. With cloud services, you can access your backed-up stuff \u2013 such as documents or media \u2013 from virtually any Internet-connected computer, tablet or smartphone in the world. Most cloud services have free apps that make it easy to download or upload files from your mobile device. So long as you can get online, you can access your stuff anywhere and on virtually any device.\n\nSharing is super easy. Cloud computing can also reduce congestion in someone\u2019s inbox. Rather than trying to email several large photos or videos to a colleague, friend or family member, which can clog up their inbox, you can simply store them in the cloud and send a link to download the goods. This is incredibly convenient, and easy to do.\n\nReal-time collaboration. Especially ideal for students and coworkers, cloud computing lets people work together on projects in real-time, even though they\u2019re in different geographic locations. For example, two or more employees can collaborate on a project together, instead of sending revisions back and forth to each other (sound familiar?).\n\nPrice is right. Consumer-based cloud computing services typically give you between 10 and 15 gigabytes of storage for free (Dropbox gives you less, 2 GB free). This is ample for most users. In fact, you can create and use multiple accounts, if you like, each with a few gigabytes, making it easy to triple or quadruple your allotted storage.\n\nShould you need more space, iCloud, which gives you 5 GB for free, offers 50 GB for 99 cents monthly (and increased capacity such 2 terabytes for $9.99/month). Once you stop paying, that\u2019s it. And there are pricier corporate solutions, too, if you need them.\n\nYou get 5 gigabytes of storage free with iCloud, but after that you\u2019ll need to pay a monthly service for iCloud (as well as other competing cloud providers). It may only be a couple of bucks a month, and you can backup from anywhere in the world, but once you stop paying you\u2019re without your files.
