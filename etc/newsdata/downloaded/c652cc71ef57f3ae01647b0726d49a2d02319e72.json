That probably could have been handled better for sure.\n\nDeschamps decided to keep Kante with the squad rather than send him home to Chelsea\n\n'Our doctors were speaking and there were some times when things weren't coming back to us when I would expect them to come back - that's what I mean about communication.\n\n'It was quite clear he wasn't fit to play. We would have wanted him back to work on him.'\n\nMeanwhile, Reece James is in line to make his Premier League debut against Newcastle on Saturday.\n\nJames, 19, starred for Wigan in the Championship last season, so much so that Lampard tried to take him to Derby midway through the campaign and then insisted he would not be loaned out again this year when he took over at Stamford Bridge.\n\nJames has started against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and Lille in the Champions League and is now set to be handed a first Premier League appearance.", "description": "Kante will miss Chelsea's clash with Newcastle due to a groin problem as his injury issues continue, having also been sidelined this season due to knee, ankle and hamstring problems.", "authors": ["Adrian Kajumba For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/14/19885204-0-image-a-42_1571404600771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
