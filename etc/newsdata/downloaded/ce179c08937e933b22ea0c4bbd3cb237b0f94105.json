He reiterated that Beijing was under pressure to strike a bargain as its economy weakens, which he attributed to US actions.\n\nHowever, the goods exempted do not include high-profile agricultural items like soybeans and pork that could be crucial to the ultimate success of any agreement.\n\nThe exemptions will become effective on September 17 and be valid for a year, according to the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, which released two lists that include seafood products and anti-cancer drugs.\n\nThe lists mark the first time Beijing has announced products to be excluded from tariffs.\n\nOther categories that will be spared include alfalfa pellets and fish feed, and the commission said it was also considering further exemptions.\n\nBoth sides imposed fresh tit-for-tat tariffs on September 1, adding to the duties that now cover hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods.\n\nTrump initiated the trade war complaining that China engaged in unfair trade practices.\n\n\"These adjustments signal that China is more willing to make progress in the October trade talks, likely toward striking a 'narrow' agreement that involves China buying more US goods in exchange for the US suspending further tariff hikes,\" Barclays analysts said in a research note.\n\nThey said Beijing had been sounding a more \"constructive\" note in recent weeks over trade relations.\n\n- Growing pressure -\n\nBut US businesses in China are increasingly pessimistic about their prospects.\n\nA report released Wednesday said growing numbers of companies expect their revenues and investment in the local market to shrink.\n\nThe American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai's report said 47 percent surveyed said they expected to increase their investments in China in 2019, down from 62 percent last year.\n\nThree-quarters of businesses surveyed said they opposed the use of punitive tariffs by the United States to force China into a trade deal.\n\nChina's economy grew 6.2 percent on-year in the second quarter, the lowest rate in nearly three decades -- a fact Trump highlighted on Wednesday.\n\nAuto sales in China fell by 6.9 percent in August compared with the previous year, an official industry association said Wednesday, extending a slump.\n\nTrump has said the protracted trade war is damaging China more than the United States, and China is \"eating the tariffs.\"\n\nBut experts have warned there are signs the US is also feeling the pinch, with job creation slowing across major industries last month.\n\nWall Street added to gains after Trump spoke, reflecting renewed hope an agreement could be reached to end the trade war.\n\nThe benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.9 percent to close at 27,137.04.\n\nburs-sms-dg/it/jah", "description": "After an apparent conciliatory move by China, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday made one of his own, announcing that he agreed to delay an increase in tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods by two weeks.
