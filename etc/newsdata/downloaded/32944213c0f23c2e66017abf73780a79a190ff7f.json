Anyone who will persist with any activity related to witchcraft will face the full might of the law.\"\n\nThe statement, released on Tuesday, said the Witchcraft Act of 1889 defines witchcraft, sorcery or the practice of voodoo as a punishable offence.\n\n\"Government cannot sit back and watch while the lives of the citizens of this country are exposed to illegal and weird practices that have the potential to poison the minds of (Swazi people), especially children,\" Simelane added.\n\n\"Government will not allow the voodoo competition - period!\"\n\neSwatini has a population of 1.3 million people, with many following Christianity and indigenous beliefs.\n\nThe Times of Swaziland on Wednesday quoted \"Africa Gama\", the organiser of the event, as saying the competition would have pit witchdoctors against traditional healers as under the previous king Sobhuza II, who died in 1982.\n\n\"The King was concerned about unnecessary competition among healers so he called them to one place so that they could demonstrate their powers,\" he said.\n\n\"I was competing with traditional healers, doctors, and prophets from across the world.\"", "description": "A competition pitting witchdoctors against each other in a battle of skills this weekend in eSwatini -- formerly known as Swaziland -- has been banned, according to a government statement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3385/77bf7d8a2e2d44a089af00dcce651f48.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-11"}
