He will be sentenced Jan. 3. for conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering in federal court in Richmond.\n\nRobertson was first convicted in 2017 and sentenced to 40 years in prison. But an appeals court granted him a new trial because the Richmond Times-Dispatch had reported on remarks the judge made out of the jury\u2019s earshot about the \u201cvery, very overwhelming\u201d evidence and Robertson\u2019s lack of credibility.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same judge, John A. Gibney Jr., presided over Robertson\u2019s second jury trial.\n\nAfter college, Roberston was briefly signed to the Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings, but his professional football career never took off. Instead, he became a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch, according to court documents, and then conspired with an associate named Sherman Carl Vaughn to start a pair of fraudulent investment firms.\n\nAlong with his football connections, according to court records, he exploited people he knew from the Christian boarding school Fork Union Military Academy. He got his stepson to doctor account statements for investors to convince them that their money was growing.\n\nAD\n\nRobertson also used victims\u2019 names to falsely obtain $250,000 in loans. The fraud lasted from 2008 until his arrest in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Eugene Monroe testified that he lost more than $1 million to his college teammate. Another victim said Robertson persuaded her to retire early as a nurse at U-Va., knowing that he had lost all her money; she found out it was gone on the way to her retirement party. One victim killed himself, his son told the court, to spare his family the cost of medical treatment they could no longer afford.\n\nRobertson paid back about $1.4 million to investors using other people\u2019s money, according to his trial testimony. In both trials, Robertson maintained that his business efforts were legitimate and could still succeed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI still believe in my heart that everybody will be made whole,\u201d he said at his first sentencing, according to the transcript. \u201cHopefully one day God will see fit to say, hey, here it is. Here is the $9.2 million.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter the first trial, his attorneys noted that law enforcement could directly trace only about a third of the money, $3.3 million, that went to \u201cpurely personal, nonbusiness related uses\u201d as opposed to failed business ventures. That did not include hundreds of thousands of dollars Robertson gave to his church and paid for his children\u2019s college tuition, as well as some family trips to Hawaii and Disney World.\n\nVaughn pleaded guilty and testified against Robertson at trial; he is serving a 12-year prison sentence.\n\nAD\n\nAt the first sentencing, Gibney said Robertson was an unusual defendant, based on the number of people he victimized and his lack of remorse.\n\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to have been any consideration of the horrible effect on the victims in this case,\u201d Gibney said at the first sentencing, according to a transcript. \u201cThe blatant dishonesty, the disrespect of others . . . the misuse of sacred relationships.\u201d", "description": "Merrill Robertson Jr. solicited investments from football contacts, childhood friends, prosecutors said.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/x5G9eLyimA0m1pHmewRTAVP1vRw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HVIARWH2N4I6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
