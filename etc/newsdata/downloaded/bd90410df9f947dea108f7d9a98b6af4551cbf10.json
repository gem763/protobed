MLB and the players\u2019 association agreed to the extension on Wednesday, which ends Germ\u00e1n\u2019s season.\n\nGerm\u00e1n is being investigated for an alleged domestic violence incident involving his girlfriend at home last week, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Friday. The person spoke under condition of anonymity because no details have been authorized during the probe by MLB.\n\nThe 27-year-old right-hander was the top winner for the AL East champions this season, going 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 24 starts and three relief appearances over 143 innings this year. The Yankees start the playoffs Oct. 4.\n\nGerm\u00e1n gets paid his $577,500 salary during the leave, but the time missed could later be turned into an unpaid suspension.\n\nHe had the right to challenge the administrative leave before an arbitrator.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yankees pitcher Domingo Germ\u00e1n's administrative leave under Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy has been extended through the World Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/yankees_german_baseball_49730_c0-88-2101-1312_s1770x1032.jpg?b9b29a8ba865bde512b91dc2f77c2920aba015d2", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
