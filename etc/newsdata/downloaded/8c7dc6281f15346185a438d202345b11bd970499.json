REUTERS/Al Drago\n\nThe Pentagon said the deployment would involve a moderate number of troops - not numbering thousands - and would be primarily defensive in nature.\n\nReuters has previously reported that the Pentagon was considering sending anti-missile batteries, drones and more fighter jets. The United States is also considering keeping an aircraft carrier in the region indefinitely.\n\n\u201cIn response to the kingdom\u2019s request, the president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature and primarily focussed on air and missile defence,\u201d U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said at a news briefing.\n\n\u201cWe will also work to accelerate the delivery of military equipment to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to enhance their ability to defend themselves.\u201d\n\nEsper added the United Arab Emirates, a close ally that hosts U.S. forces, had also requested assistance.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s late Friday announcement appeared to close the door to any imminent decision to wage retaliatory strikes against Iran following the attack, which rattled global markets and exposed major gaps in Saudi Arabia\u2019s air defences.\n\nBut the deployment could further aggravate Iran, which has responded to previous U.S. troop deployments this year with apprehension. It denies responsibility for the attack on Saudi Arabia as well as attacks on oil tankers earlier this year.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition that includes the UAE, has claimed responsibility for the strikes.\n\nATTACK LAUNCHED FROM IRAN?\n\nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have fingered southwest Iran as the staging ground for the attack, an assessment based at least in part on still-classified imagery showing Iran appearing to prepare an aerial strike.\n\nThey have dismissed Houthi claims that the attacks originated in Yemen.\n\nOne of the officials told Reuters the strike may have been authorized by Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe United States, wary of getting dragged into another conflict in the Middle East, has troops positioned in Syria and Iraq, two countries where Iranian influence is strong and Iran-backed forces operate openly.\n\nSaudi Arabia has said it was attacked by a total of 25 drones and missiles, including Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and \u201cYa Ali\u201d cruise missiles.\n\nU.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said officials were still hammering out the best array of capabilities to defend Saudi Arabia, noting the difficulty combating a swarm of drones.\n\n\u201cNo single system is going to be able to defend against a threat like that, but a layered system of defensive capabilities would mitigate the risk of swarms of drones or other attacks that may come from Iran,\u201d Dunford said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia's air defences after the largest-ever attack on the kingdom's oil facilities, which Washington has squarely blamed on Iran.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432165630&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J2DW", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
