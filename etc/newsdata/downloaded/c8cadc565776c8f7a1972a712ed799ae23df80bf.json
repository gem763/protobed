Bernard Sanders, one of his top rivals.\n\n\n\nMr. Biden said at a fundraiser in Florida that he\u2019s getting \u201cbeat up because I\u2019m not the socialist,\u201d according to a pool report of the event.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one promising Medicare for All, which by the way costs $34 trillion over 10 years,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMr. Biden said his health care plan, which includes a public health insurance option, \u201cis $720 billion over ten years. We can afford that, without raising your taxes.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Biden, who has been slipping in some of the recent polling on the 2020 Democratic field in early states like Iowa, also targeted the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d vision championed by candidates like Mr. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren at a separate fundraiser in Palm Beach Gardens.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to spend 35, 34 trillion dollars in 10 years to get Medicare for All,\u201d he said. \u201cNotice the last debate they\u2019re all now adopting the Biden plan, Medicare for those who want it. You can keep your insurance, you can do a whole range of things, we do this all, these things we can do.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
