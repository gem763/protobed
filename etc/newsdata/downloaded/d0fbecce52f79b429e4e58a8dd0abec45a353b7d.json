These picked up by 5.4 percentage points to 69% in the third quarter \u2014 compared with a 2023 target of 75%.\n\nIn the third quarter, SAP reported a 10% increase in revenue and a 15% rise in operating profit, after adjusting one-off items and currencies, helping it to achieve an expansion of 1.7% in its operating margins.\n\nThe company reiterated its forecast for the year and through to 2023. SAP is due to update investors on strategy at a capital markets' day in New York on Nov. 12.", "description": "Business software group SAP said on Monday it had reached a three-year deal with Microsoft to help its large enterprise customers move their business processes into the cloud.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106192376-1571639765203gettyimages-1090745214.jpeg?v=1571639868", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
