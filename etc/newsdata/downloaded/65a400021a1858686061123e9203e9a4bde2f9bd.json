Again, big money was the justification.\n\nBoxing does not need circus acts. Certainly not when its stock is rising fast on the back of two successive Saturday nights in the US which produced Fight of the Year candidates.\n\nNigel Benn is coming back a staggering 23 years after his last professional fight\n\nGennady Golovkin (left) had to come through an all-out war with Sergy Derevyanchenko\n\nGennady Golovkin\u2019s weekend regaining of one of the world middleweight titles stolen from him by Canelo Alvarez required narrow victory in an all-out war with Sergy Derevyanchenko, which surpassed in terms of its spectacular brutality even Errol Spence Jr\u2019s unifying of world welterweight titles against Shawn Porter seven days earlier.\n\nShortly before those classics we had Vasyl Lomachenko demonstrating his pound-for-pound greatness here in the UK against Luke Campbell. Then Daniel Dubois alerted the world \u2013 Fury, Wilder and Anthony Joshua included \u2013 that he is the heir apparent to the heavyweight throne.\n\nYet, suddenly, the integrity of the hardest game finds itself under threat from freak shows. Even though the protagonists being lured into them are in no need of the cash.\n\nNot Mayweather or McGregor after their mega-millions pas-de-deux, that\u2019s for sure. Not Benn, according to his own testimony that \u2018there is nothing financial about me doing this.\u2019\n\nNot Fury, who has been working his way through the first two fights of a reported \u00a380million contract with Disney via the ESPN network in the US, against little-known opponents.\n\nNow, Tyson is a fun-loving traveller. He veers between pronouncing his ambition to become the undisputed world heavyweight champion and reigning for ten years, to talking about hanging up the gloves tomorrow. Often in the same interview.\n\nFury is still recovering from the 47-stitches to the cut above his eye suffered on September 14\n\nSo it is not easy to divine what he truly means.\n\nHowever, as a natural showman, he has always been attracted to the Entertainment element of the WWE. So he was only too happy to treat his wrestling-mad son to a birthday night out at one of their shows on Friday.\n\nHis shouting match with the Monster across the ropes there might have been dismissed as a mutually promoting lark, in Fury\u2019s case to whip up more American enthusiasm for Wilder II.\n\nExcept that they were due to clash verbally again late on Monday night in the US \u2013 at WWE Raw in Bakersville \u2013 amid speculation that an announcement of their sand-shoe shuffle is imminent.\n\nHopefully this is just another of Fury\u2019s amusing, mischievous flirtations. Not an engagement leading to a divorce from boxing, which would be a body blow to the sport which has brought him fame and fortune.", "description": "JEFF POWELL: If Tyson Fury is serious about throwing himself into a WWE match it not only raises hard questions about his future but also sounds another deafening alarm bell for boxing.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/22/19414032-0-image-a-38_1570483766049.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
