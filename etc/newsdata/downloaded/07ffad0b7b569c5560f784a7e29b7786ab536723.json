Jeremy Munson, of Lake Crystal, posted a Facebook video showing him walking into a WalMart and buying a vial of the cheaper, older form of insulin for $24.88. He then tells the camera that diabetics shouldn\u2019t need to ration their insulin because there are affordable options.\n\nDemocrats and diabetes advocates quickly criticized his advice as dangerous, warning that the two types of insulin can\u2019t be used the same way.\n\nThe Star Tribune reports the debate over the video comes as Republicans and Democrats hold hearings on competing proposals for providing insulin to diabetics who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Star Tribune, http://www.startribune.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Republican lawmaker has come under criticism for promoting a cheaper form of insulin, while legislators debate whether and how Minnesota should help diabetics with the high cost of newer insulin products.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
