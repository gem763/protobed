If the justices rule in favor of Louisiana's law, the state would become the seventh in the country with just one abortion clinic.\n\nThe law in question is nearly identical to one that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional in 2016. The high court in February indicated it would take a thorough look at the case when it agreed to block the law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\n\nThe Supreme Court's announcement drew a swift reaction from abortion rights groups.\n\n\"Louisiana is openly defying the Supreme Court's decision from just three years ago, in which they found an identical Texas law unconstitutional,\" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is challenging Louisiana's law. \"We are counting on the Court to follow its precedent, otherwise, clinics will needlessly close and there will be just one doctor left in the entire state to provide abortion care.\"\n\nThe justices met in private earlier this week to discuss the hundreds of appeals that piled up over the summer.\n\nThe most significant of those pending appeals involved abortion regulations in Louisiana and an ultrasound requirement in Indiana, on which the court did not act Friday. Both cases involve the standard first laid out by the court in 1992 that while states can regulate abortion they can't do things that place an \"undue burden\" on a woman's right to an abortion.\n\nLouisiana abortion providers and a district judge who initially heard the case said one or maybe two of the state's three abortion clinics would have to close under the new law. There would be at most two doctors who could meet its requirements, they said.\n\nBut the appeals court in New Orleans rejected those claims, doubting that any clinics would have to close and saying the doctors had not tried hard enough to establish relationships with local hospitals.\n\nIn January, the full appeals court voted 9-6 not to get involved in the case, setting up the Supreme Court appeal.\n\nIn February, the justices split 5-4 to keep the law on hold. Chief Justice John Roberts, a dissenter in the 2016 case from Texas, joined with the court's four liberal justices to temporarily block the Louisiana measure.\n\nFor Roberts, it was a rare vote against an abortion restriction in more than 13 years as chief justice, perhaps a reflection of his new role since Kennedy's retirement as the court's swing justice and his concern about the court being perceived as a partisan institution.\n\nGorsuch and Kavanaugh, along with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, would have allowed Louisiana to begin enforcing the clinic regulations.\n\nThe Hope Medical Group clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, and two doctors whose identities are not revealed said in their appeal that the justices should strike down the law without even holding arguments because the decision so clearly conflicts with the Texas ruling from 2016.\n\nThe court did not follow that path Friday. The Supreme Court decision comes three days after Planned Parenthood announced the building of a mega-clinic in southern Illinois \u2014 just 13 miles away from Missouri's last remaining abortion clinic, a facility in St. Louis that is fighting to keep its license.\n\nWith a newly conservative Supreme Court, access to abortion has come under fire across the South and Midwest, where state lawmakers have raced to pass laws that ban the procedure in hopes of overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that effectively legalized the procedure nationwide.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The justices have agreed to take up a Louisiana \u200blaw that could leave the state with just one clinic", "authors": ["Kate Smith"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/28/8323c752-f022-45c2-badd-9d7227097075/thumbnail/1200x630g2/0153a9e670da303e50a5115f742e749b/gettyimages-1084717730.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
