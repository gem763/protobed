An independent expert panel would approve grant requests from governments, wrote Mortimer D.A. Sackler, whose father, Dr. Mortimer Sackler, was a co-founder of Purdue, in a September 2018 email when he still served on the board.\n\nPurdue\u2019s board of directors approved the project in early 2019, but the company tabled it by March.\n\nPurdue said in a statement that its negotiations with Oklahoma, which was preparing for a trial against the company, \u201ccaused us to rethink our approach.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should drugmakers contribute funds toward addressing the opioid crisis? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn March, Purdue struck a $270 million agreement to settle claims brought by the state, which included $102.5 million toward funding a national addiction center at Oklahoma State University. The Sacklers pledged $75 million toward the center. Scientific data and research that Purdue said in August was transferred to OSU would likely have been contributed to the foundation, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nPurdue also had legal concerns over how a new foundation and a potential bankruptcy filing might impact each other, according to people familiar with the matter. The company had begun preparing for a bankruptcy filing in early March, and such a move is now expected after Purdue reached a partial deal Wednesday with attorneys representing thousands of municipalities and 23 states and several U.S. territories, the Journal reported.\n\nMr. Sackler later withdrew his backing for the foundation\u2014in part because the funds wouldn\u2019t count toward a settlement with states and municipalities suing\u2014while other family members supported the project, according to a person familiar with the matter. The sprawling Sackler family has long been fractious. No Sackler family members still serve on Purdue\u2019s board.\n\nIn its statement, Purdue said the plans had the \u201cfull support and backing\u201d of the Sacklers and that the company long considered creating a foundation to address the opioid crisis and share scientific information gleaned from the company over the years.\n\nPurdue has worked for several years with other organizations to address the opioid crisis, including funding distribution of opioid overdose antidote naloxone.\n\nA spokesperson for the families of Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, the physician brothers who helped start Purdue, said, \u201cRather than continuing to explore a foundation with limited reach, we are focused on providing far more substantial resources to the patients, families and communities across the country who are suffering and need assistance.\u201d\n\nMr. Sackler wrote his September 2018 email to other Sacklers, Purdue executives and board members to suggest the content of a potential statement from the family about the opioid crisis. The statement should convey their view that \u201cgetting the money out into the local communities hardest hit by this crisis as well as driving the research needed to better understand the underlying causes are both worthy goals,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn his email, which ran more than 900 words, Mr. Sackler also singled out the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys who represent the thousands of cities and counties suing Purdue and other companies for their alleged roles in fueling the opioid crisis. He said the family \u201ccould no longer stay quiet due to the massive amount of misinformation and fake news that has been pushed out by the trial lawyers.\u201d\n\nThe email isn\u2019t public but was viewed by the Journal. A portion of it is referenced in a state complaint against Purdue and the Sacklers by the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n\nHow much the Sacklers are willing to contribute to Purdue\u2019s settlement has been a point of contention in negotiations with states and local governments, the Journal has reported. The company values the current deal at $10 billion to $12 billion, though much of that relies on future sales of OxyContin and drugs in development for treatment. Some states want the family to guarantee more than the $3 billion that the deal specifies they pay. Purdue and other companies have denied the allegations raised in the lawsuits.\n\nPurdue is also in discussions with the U.S. Justice Department to resolve criminal and civil probes related to OxyContin, the Journal reported last week.\n\nOther health-care companies accused in lawsuits of helping fuel the opioid crisis have also started nonprofit organizations in recent years. The companies have said those charitable efforts reflect their commitment to resolving the crisis.\n\nConcerns about a bankruptcy complicating a foundation\u2019s operations aren\u2019t misplaced, according to legal experts. Richard Ausness, a law professor at the University of Kentucky, said removing a company\u2019s assets and putting them elsewhere reduce what is available to satisfy judgment.\n\n\u201cThe bankruptcy court might unravel that,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the time of Mr. Sackler\u2019s email last year, the Sacklers hadn\u2019t publicly commented on the crisis or the mounting litigation against their company. Their first statement came February from a family spokesman in response to questions for a Journal article about nonprofits distancing themselves from the family.\n\nThis year, a number of museums, universities and other institutions around the world suspended gifts from Sackler family members associated with Purdue amid scrutiny of the drug company\u2019s role in the opioid epidemic. Charitable organizations overseen by Sacklers have also suspended donations.\n\nWrite to Jared S.
