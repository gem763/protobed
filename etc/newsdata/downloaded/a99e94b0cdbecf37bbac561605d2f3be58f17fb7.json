Steyer has long been one of the most visible and deep-pocketed supporters of impeachment. He has also qualified for next month\u2019s Democratic debates.\n\nHe added that his group, Need to Impeach, has seen evidence of this in their work. \u201cWhen they see it, whether they're a Trump supporter or Trump opposer, they all say the same thing -- I didn't know it. He's a liar and a crook. If I did that, I'd be in jail,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all say those three things.\u201d\n\nA recent poll found that, as of last week, a majority of Americans remain opposed to impeachment: 37% say Trump should be removed from office, while 57% oppose the move.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and businessman Tom Steyer walks down the grand concourse during a visit to the Iowa State Fair, Sunday, Aug. 11, 2019, in Des Moines, Iowa.

One tracking poll released Thursday found growing voter support for impeachment.\n\nThe impeachment process is designed, in part, to educate the public about the charges facing the president. Currently, six House committees will continue their ongoing investigations into the to formulate the articles of impeachment. Then, it would lead to the House floor for a debate.\n\nIf the House impeaches Trump, the next step would be a trial in the Senate. Such a trial would be a made for television spectacle that would surely test Steyer\u2019s hypothesis that the more the American people know about Trump\u2019s misdeeds, the more likely they are to support removing him from office.\n\nThe outcome of a trial isn\u2019t the most important thing for Steyer (and in fact, the president would likely be acquitted if his Republican colleagues support him). \u201cPeople think that the court is going to be the Republican Senators and I disagree\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf the American people decide, this guy has to go and the Republican senators vote to keep him \u2013 that's their funeral.\u201d\n\nBen Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe leading Democrats have minimal business backgrounds.
