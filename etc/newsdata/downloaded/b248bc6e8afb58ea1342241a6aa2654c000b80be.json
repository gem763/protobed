But the bloc denied changing its stance, and a top EU leader accused U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of playing a \u201cstupid blame game.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s office gave a gloomy assessment after a call between Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn a statement to British media, Downing St. said Merkel had told the prime minister that \u201ca deal is overwhelmingly unlikely\u201d unless Northern Ireland remains in a customs union with the EU \u2014 something the U.K. says it can\u2019t allow.\n\nDowning St. said that \u201cif this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever.\u201d\n\nThe German government confirmed that the two leaders had spoken by phone. It didn\u2019t comment on the substance of the discussion, saying in an emailed response to a query that \u201cas usual, we are not reporting on such confidential conversations.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said \u201cthe EU position has not changed. We want a deal. We are working for a deal with the U.K.\u201d\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk tweeted testily that \u201cwhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people,\u201d he said, addressing Johnson. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u201d \u2014 a Latin phrase meaning \u201cwhere are you going?\u201d\n\nEU leaders have demanded more \u201crealism\u201d from Britain in response to a Brexit plan proposed by Johnson. The bloc says the proposals don\u2019t fulfil the U.K.\u2019s commitment to a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has urged the bloc to compromise.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said the EU will assess by Friday whether a deal is possible.\n\nJohnson insists the U.K. will leave the EU on Oct. 31 even without a deal. Many economists say that will disrupt British trade and plunge the country into recession.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain published more details of its plans for a no-deal Brexit, which the government says can minimize any economic shock from leaving without a deal \u2014 but major business groups warn that no amount of preparation can eliminate the pain of new barriers with the EU, which accounts for almost half of U.K. trade.\n\nMany in the EU \u2014 and in Britain \u2014 are skeptical that Britain will leave the bloc on Oct. 31, because the U.K. Parliament has passed a law compelling the government to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit if no deal is agreed upon by Oct. 19.\n\nJohnson says he will obey the law, but will not ask for a delay. It\u2019s not clear how those two statements can bd reconciled \u2014 but it\u2019s clear Johnson wants to pin the blame for any delay on Parliament and the EU, so that he can campaign as a champion of Brexit in a U.K. election that\u2019s likely to be called soon.\n\nKeir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the main opposition Labour Party, said the Downing St. statement was \u201cyet another cynical attempt by No. 10 to sabotage the negotiations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Britain due to leave the EU in just over three weeks, the U.K. Parliament is set to be suspended later Tuesday so that a new session can begin next week with a major policy speech from the government.\n\nAn earlier attempt by the government to shut down Parliament for five weeks was ruled illegal by the U.K. Supreme Court because it had the effect of preventing Parliament from scrutinizing the government\u2019s Brexit plans. This week\u2019s shorter suspension is more routine. Lawmakers will return on Monday for the State Opening of Parliament, which includes a speech delivered by Queen Elizabeth II outlining the government\u2019s legislative plans.\n\nBut most of those plans may be halted by an early election. Both government and the opposition see a national vote as the only way to break Britain\u2019s Brexit deadlock, though they disagree on the timing.\n\n___\n\nCasert reported form Brussels.
