The ruling cited a 2018 tweet from Musk\u2019s personal account among the violations in which he seemed to imply that employees who unionised would lose their company-paid stock options.\n\nNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 21, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s only his latest in a series of godawful tweets to prompt legal action, including that infamous \u201c$420\" tweet that cost Tesla $30 million in a settlement with the SEC.\n\nHe later called that one totally \u201cworth it\u201d, which may explain why after all this he still has yet to log-off Twitter.\n\nAlso on Saturday, the U.S. National Labour Relations Board levied a complaint against the publisher of conservative news outlet the Federalist concerning a similarly anti-union tweet, Bloomberg Law reported. \u201c[F]irst one of you tries to unionize I swear I\u2019ll send you back to the salt mine,\u201d the outlet\u2019s co-founder, Ben Domenech, posted in June, prompting an employee to begin filing an unfair labour practice charge with the NLRB.\n\nThough the employee later withdrew the charge, the board is continuing to pursue legal recourse and demands the tweet be deleted. According to a complaint obtained by Bloomberg Law, the board contends Domenech and the publication \u201cthreatened employees with reprisals and implicitly threatened employees with reprisals and implicitly threatened employees with loss of their jobs if they formed or supported a union.\u201d\n\nAnd because bad news always comes in threes, these developments come on the heels of a yet another bad-tweet incident last month. There the founder of online sports outlet Barstool Sports, Dave Portnoy, dared his employees to just try forming a union so he could \u201csmash their little union to smithereens\u201d in a blog post that sounded every bit like it was written by a playground bully. He later fired off a series of tweets threatening to fire and sue any employees who spoke to union lawyers.\n\nWithin hours they were deleted, though, after the nation\u2019s largest union, the AFL-CIO, began alleging on Twitter that his response broke U.S. federal labour regulations, per Bloomberg Law.\n\nAs for Saturday\u2019s Tesla ruling, the judge described several \u201cunfair labour practices\u201d under the U.S. National Relations Act that occurred at the company\u2019s Fremont, California factory. This included instating strict company rules governing the distribution of pro-union pamphlets, grilling workers about their union activities, and telling employees that union efforts would be \u201cfutile\u201d, per the ruling.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment. In all likelihood, though, an appeal is not far off. The judge ordered Tesla to reinstate and give back pay to a pro-union employee the company fired among a bevy of remedial actions. Unfortunately, none of these involved Musk deleting his Twitter account.", "description": "These past few weeks have not been great for arsehole bosses on Twitter.", "authors": ["Julie Muncy", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/xinqgjwwyg4ogcmasisu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
