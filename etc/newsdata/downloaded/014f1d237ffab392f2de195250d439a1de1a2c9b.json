The Equality Court will have to determine what the facts are. I think the remarks that he got away with murder in the past are inappropriate, given the commission has not determined the facts.\"\n\nGaum appeared to soften the tone taken by the commission's legal head, Buang Jones, at a community meeting in Langebaan on Thursday night.\n\nREAD: 'Langebaan Four' seek compensation of over R1m from Etzebeth after alleged assault, racial abuse\n\nJones claimed this was not the first time Etzebeth had engaged in such conduct.\n\n\"He always got away with it. But this time around, it stops here,\" he said to thunderous applause, News24 reported.\n\nTimesLive also reported that Jones had reportedly said Etzebeth \"was used to getting away with murder\".\n\nOn Friday, provincial commissioner Chris Nissen said it was not pushing for Etzebeth to return prematurely from the World Cup in Japan.\n\n\"We wish that he plays well and hope that he will bring back the cup to South Africa,\" he added, indicating the Equality Court case and parallel police investigation would run as they should.\n\nEtzebeth is expected to be given a chance to respond to the papers and the court will set down a date when he can be present.\n\nEtzebeth has been accused of racially abusing a fellow patron at a pub in Langebaan in August. This, as the police are investigating a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, crimen injuria and the pointing of a firearm also in August.\n\n\"No one has been arrested or charged and the individual implicated in the matter cannot be named at this stage,\" said Lieutenant Colonel Andr\u00e8 Traut.\n\nALSO READ: \u2018I was a fan\u2019, says man who alleges assault, racial abuse by Etzebeth\n\nOn Thursday, SAHRC members met with the police, spoke with the management of the local yacht club, looked at CCTV footage and briefed residents in the evening on the case.\n\nJones said at the briefing on Friday the police were looking at the possibility of charging Etzebeth with attempted murder.\n\nHe added the commission had received support from many South Africans of all races.\n\n\"There are people who are coming forward with more information pertaining to Mr Etzebeth. A white compatriot, an elderly pensioner, has brought to my attention that there are other allegations against the Etzebeths that have not been handled properly and he would like the commission to also intervene,\" said Jones.\n\n\"There are a number of allegations that have been made, some which still need to be verified. We were told last night by the community that Mr Etzebeth and his friends, they call themselves the Wolf Pack gang, they have been terrorising communities on the West Coast and they would like the commission to intervene.\"\n\nEtzebeth responded to the allegations on his Facebook page.\n\nHe said: \"It is completely untrue and unfounded to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone in Langebaan as has been reported on social media. Multiple witnesses can corroborate that.\n\n\"I am and will always strive to be a true ambassador to this beautiful rainbow nation and the sport that I love.\"", "description": "The South African Human Rights Commission says it has received further allegations about Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth and his relatives but maintained a position that he was innocent until proven guilty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9430/04090c991ce6414b91915db2a1fac5a9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
