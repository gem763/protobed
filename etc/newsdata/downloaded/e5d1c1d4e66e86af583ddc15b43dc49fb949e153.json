That, for Donald John Trump, is what winning looks like.\"\n\n\u201cTwo years after the Trump administration\u2019s first punishing acts towards China, the United States still faces a forever escalating trade war without clear strategies, goals, and endgames,\u201d write Dingding Chen and Tiffany Chen.\n\nThe pair of analysts from the Guangzhou-based Intellisia Institute suggest American policy is, among other things, muddled. The title of their August 23 piece on The Diplomat site says it all: \u201cOne Year into the U.S.-China Trade War, Trump Is Still Far from Winning.\u201d\n\nWhat, for President Trump, is \u201cwinning\u201d?\n\nIf the two Chens are correct, it is not possible to answer that question because the American leader has not defined what he wants, and many others agree. Take Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary under George W. Bush. \u201cWe have,\u201d Paulson told the Wall Street Journal, \u201ca China attitude, not a China policy.\u201d\n\nYes, Trump has plenty of China attitude, but evident from all that attitude is a policy. Trump, one way or another, is out to change history\u2019s course.\n\nThe course of history, in the view of many, is that China will rise to dominate this century. That\u2019s not how the 45th president sees things, however. Trump, unlike his four immediate predecessors, does not seem to be particularly concerned about the welfare of China\u2019s Communist Party. And unlike two\u2014and maybe all three\u2014of his three immediate predecessors, he is not trying to manage American decline.\n\nTrump asserts U.S. power, and to borrow his new slogan, his goal is to \u201cKeep America Great.\u201d\n\nYes, that phrase is vague, but the policy decisions of the Trump administration evidence a goal of frustrating Chinese ambitions across the board.\n\nNowhere has the policy been as clear as in the trade area. On the first of this month, the latest batch of increased tariffs on China went into effect. The new tariffs, according to the New York Times, bring average American rate on Chinese goods to 21.2 percent. When Trump came into office, the rate stood at only 3.1 percent.\n\nTrump, both before and after the inauguration, complained about the outsized American trade deficit with China. In 2016, the U.S. merchandise deficit with that country was $346.83 billion. The deficit stood at $167.0 billion in June, on track for $334.0 this year.\n\nSo, if the trade deficit is the correct measure\u2014many economists correctly say it is not\u2014America is not exactly winning.\n\nMoreover, America also appears to be losing if theft of intellectual property is the yardstick. The tariffs that everyone loves to complain about\u2014and the tariffs the official China Daily says will \u201cbackfire\u201d\u2014are imposed under the authority of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to remedy such taking. There is no evidence suggesting China\u2019s criminality has been tapering off.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s broader goal is on the road to fulfillment. To borrow one of Beijing\u2019s favorite words, there is a \u201cdecoupling\u201d of the world\u2019s first- and second-largest economies. In a four-part tweet of August 23 loaded with \u201cattitude,\u201d the president \u201cordered\u201d American companies \u201cto immediately start looking for an alternative to China.\u201d\n\nAlthough he walked back the comment shortly later, Trump returned to the theme September 1 when he tweeted that importers should find factories outside China so that Americans will not have to be \u201cservants to the Chinese.\u201d Clearly, disengagement is his desired state.\n\nTrump, therefore, is a revolutionary. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anyone do what President Trump has done,\u201d Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics told the New York Times. Bown\u2019s right. As the paper noted with a whiff of disapproval on the first of this month, \u201cEach tariff increase has also taken the United States in the opposite direction from were trade policy has been pointing for decades.\u201d\n\nFor some, moving in the opposite direction is absolutely the right thing to do. The tolerant\u2014and often feeble\u2014policies of this and the preceding decade have only led to China\u2019s stealing more IP and engaging in even more brazen violations of trade obligations.\n\nTrump\u2019s revolution has yet to succeed. It is hard to believe Chinese ruler Xi Jinping, who has made his admiration of Mao public, would ever accept fundamental economic reforms or even stop stealing. In these circumstances, therefore, decoupling makes sense.\n\nXi is the one who started decoupling with policies pushing foreign companies out of China, and now Trump is pulling them out with tariffs. Beijing and Washington, in what increasingly looks like a death match, are restructuring global trade.\n\nCompanies are moving factories out of China to avoid the \u201ctrade war\u201d\u2014each month brings additional prominent names fleeing Chinese soil\u2014and at least at the moment, it is hard to see these businesses returning. \u201cWe\u2019ve created high hurdles to get back to the way things were, and that means we\u2019re probably not going to,\u201d Scott Kennedy of Center for Strategic and International Studies told the Times. \u201cI think the relationship now is essentially in free fall.\u201d\n\nThe free fall worries many and angers policy elites, but an irreversible weakening of a predatory communist state looks like a good thing to everyone else. After all, why should the world help fund a Chinese system that is not compatible with the notions that underpin global commerce?\n\nMarket participants never like disruptive policies, but a reordering of global trade is now occurring and that will change history. That, for Donald John Trump, is what winning looks like.\n\nGordon G. Chang is the author of The Coming Collapse of China.
