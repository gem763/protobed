A user in the capital Addis Ababa would expect to pay around $4 a day for khat from the eastern city of Harar, long a centre of production.\n\nEthiopia's average annual per capita income is $783 (705 euros), according to the World Bank.\n\nA gateway drug\n\nWelday Hagos, a clinical psychologist and director of the Mekele-based centre - Ethiopia's only free, long-term drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility - believes that khat is a gateway drug to harder substances.\n\nHe told AFP that more than 80% of the 500 patients who have stayed there since it opened in 2015 started out chewing khat.\n\n\"After that they add cigarettes, after that they add alcohol. That's why it is the main gate for different drugs,\" said Welday.\n\n\"We are not on the right track,\" he said. \"We have to increase the knowledge of our population of the consequences of khat chewing.\"\n\nMuch like harder drugs, quitting khat takes a physical and emotional toll on longtime users, Welday said.\n\nThey complain of everything from irritability to nightmares and wild fluctuations in appetite.\n\nDespite the complaints, there is little consensus among health experts on how addictive khat actually is.\n\nAs well as individual and group therapy sessions, users treated at the centre are prescribed medication for withdrawal symptoms.\n\nThey are also offered \"spiritual sessions\", the chance to work out in a makeshift gym or by playing football and entrepreneurship training.\n\nCoffee, then khat\n\nKhat is Ethiopia's second-biggest export behind coffee, with heavy traffic to neighbouring Djibouti and Somalia.\n\nDomestic consumption is also growing especially among university students, Welday said, referring to several studies, including one published last year.\n\nSporadic campaigns by local civil society groups have failed to result in a ban like those imposed in Britain and the United States.\n\n\"In some parts of the country, especially in the eastern parts, people do not see it as a problem,\" Welday said.\n\n\"They use it for cultural celebrations and other things, similar to alcohol.\"\n\n'Makes you focus'\n\nIn an area of Addis Ababa known as Little Mogadishu, khat is often referred to as \"green gold\".\n\nOn a recent afternoon, its sleepy streets came alive with the arrival of a van bearing freshly picked khat from Harar.\n\nAfter crowding around the van and bartering for sacks of the green leaves, a group of five young men arranged their plastic stools in a circle on the roadside.\n\nShielded from the sun by an umbrella, they praised the virtues of khat while stuffing wads of it into their mouths.\n\nThe leaf, they said, serves as a pain reliever, an appetite suppressant and an anti-depressant.\n\nThey said that it calms the population, making it easier to police. And they claimed that it lowers their sex drives, making them less likely to cheat on their wives.\n\nThose who use khat while working said that it brought them to a state known as \"merkana\", which they described as an intense but joyful concentration that made them more productive.\n\nThe men had little patience for claims that khat was a \"gateway drug\".\n\n\"People who say that are people who were already addicted to alcohol, to different kinds of drugs,\" said Ousman Abdulahi.\n\n\"When you do khat, it just makes you focus.\"\n\nRebuilding lives\n\nHowever, some residents of the Substance Rehabilitation Centre say their lives were ruined by khat even without moving on to other addictions.\n\nMohammed Kelifa, 30, chewed khat for nine years.\n\nHe would stay up all night chatting up women on Facebook, he said. After his wife found out, their marriage ended in divorce.\n\nHe believes his three-month stay at the rehab centre helped him quit khat for good.\n\nNow he looks forward to rebuilding his life.\n\n\"I want to remarry and start a family and get my self-respect back,\" he said.\n\n\"Most people, when they leave this place, they fear that they will relapse, but I don't have that feeling.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
