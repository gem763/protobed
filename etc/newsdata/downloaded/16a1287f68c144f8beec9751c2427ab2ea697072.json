The circuit was then complete, and the animal could select the direction in which they wanted to travel.\n\nAfter months of training, the rats learned not only how to make the ratmobile move but also how to change direction, researchers wrote in the journal Behavioural Brain Research.\n\nWhat did they find?\n\nSome of the rats in the experiment had been raised in a lab, while others lived in \"enriched environments\" - that is, they had more natural habitats.\n\nThe rats raised in \"enriched environments\" were significantly better drivers than the lab rats.\n\nAfter the trials, researchers collected the rats' faeces to test for the stress hormone corticosterone, as well as for dehydroepiandrosterone, an anti-stress hormone.\n\nAll of the rats had higher levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, which the scientists believe could be linked to the satisfaction of having learned a new skill.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The rats controlled the car by touching different parts of the copper wire\n\nDr Lambert told AFP news agency that the findings could prove useful for future research into treatments for different psychiatric conditions.\n\n\"There's no cure for schizophrenia or depression, and we need to catch up,\" she said.\n\n\"I think we need to look at different animal models and different types of tasks and really respect that behaviour can change our neurochemistry.\"", "description": "Researchers taught rats to drive tiny \"ratmobiles\" in exchange for food, which helped the rats relax.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rxf17.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
