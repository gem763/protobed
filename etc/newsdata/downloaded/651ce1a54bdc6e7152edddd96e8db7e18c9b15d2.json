While there is a lack of scientific evidence, after hearing positive things about it (and out of intrigue more than anything else), I took Arthur when he was seven months old.\u201d\n\nPippa, 36, revealed that she saw the effects immediately.\n\n\u201cI was fascinated to see how calming it was for him, but also how valuable the feedback was,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe osteopath noticed one side of his neck was tighter than the other, which explained why he favored one side sleeping. She also saw that his arms were stronger than his legs, so she gave me an exercise to help him.\u201d\n\nDavid M.

Our local baby gym has been a saving grace. It\u2019s a big space full of fun, soft objects, play mats, stairs, balls, swings, mini trampolines and more to stimulate and physically engage babies and toddlers.\u201d\n\nCranial osteopathy being performed on a baby More\n\nPippa explained that in addition to free play, there are classes with \u201cstructured activities that help promote movement, balance and strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur burns lots of energy in this safe environment and learns many physical skills,\u201d the mother of one said. \u201cI have also noticed him building his confidence with each visit.\u201d", "description": "Pippa Middleton Shares Effects of Cranial Osteopathy on Son Arthur", "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AB_RDRO0eYf1Xa1LK8DZaQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/5fa69329b1ebba70c68f7d3213763693", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
