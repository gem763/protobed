They are as American as apple pie,\u201d Skip Miller, attorney for One America, said, according to a statement. \u201cThey are not paid by Russia and have nothing to do with the Russian government. This is a false and malicious libel, and they\u2019re going to answer for it in a court of law.\u201d\n\nCheck out Axios for a look at the lawsuit.", "description": "Last month, President Trump, in a tweet blasting Fox News\u2019 Shep Smith for not showering him with the right amount of praise, said that, \u201cwhenever possible, I...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ998_maddow_MG_20190910101234.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
