And I can assure you we will continue to encourage the United Kingdom and Ireland to ensure that any Brexit respects the Good Friday Agreement.\"\n\nThe UK's attempts to leave the EU pose unique problems for the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 accord that governs peace between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and Irish newspapers were quick to criticize Pence for his comments.\n\nThe Irish Examiner's political editor, Daniel McConnell, accused Pence of trying to \"humiliate\" his hosts. \"How dare he?\" McConnell wrote. \"The cheek of him coming here, eating our food, clogging up our roads, and then having the nerve to humiliate his hosts.\"\n\nIrish Central asked simply, \"Did VP Pence betray Ireland?\"\n\nThe Irish Times columnist Miriam Lord provided the harshest commentary on Pence's visit.\n\nShe compared Ireland's hosting of Pence to \"pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him.\"\n\nThe meeting appeared tense at times. Varadkar is gay and a prominent advocate of same-sex marriage who had greeted Pence alongside his partner, Matthew Barrett, while the vice president has consistently opposed LGBT rights and is opposed to both same-sex marriage and same-sex civil unions. He has also criticized the idea of gay people serving in the military.\n\nIn an editorial, The Irish Times said Pence's views on the issue were an \"anathema to a majority of people in modern Ireland.\"", "description": "There was no sign of crowds waiting to greet the US vice president as he arrived in Ireland, in contrast with a past visit by President Barack Obama.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7225f82e22af04f77c4fc9-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
