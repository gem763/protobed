Both Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina are facing nuisance primary challengers, which makes it harder for the incumbents to consolidate their base. But the more they try to protect their right flank, the tougher it becomes to win over the suburban moderates who decide races in these swing states.\n\nMcSally, who lost last year\u2019s election before being appointed to her seat, trailed Democratic challenger Mark Kelly by 5 points, 46 to 41 percent, in a poll taken in August. She\u2019s been outraised in all three of the fundraising quarters by significant margins\u2014an unusual disadvantage for a sitting senator. She already lags Kelly in campaign cash by nearly $4 million.\n\nTillis holds the lowest approval rating (33 percent) of any sitting senator, according to the Morning Consult survey. A Democratic poll conducted in September found him trailing his little-known Democratic opponent Cal Cunningham, 45 to 43 percent. But before he even faces Cunningham, he\u2019ll have to get past self-funded businessman Garland Tucker in the primary. Tucker has poured $1.2 million of his own money into the campaign\u2014around the same amount Tillis raised in the last three months. Tucker has already been using that money on anti-Tillis campaign ads, forcing the senator to respond in kind.", "description": "", "authors": ["Josh Kraushaar", "Nationaljournal.Com S Unlock"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
