If you don't own either, your kitchen is basically living in the dark ages. Ok, that sounded dramatic, but they really can revolutionize the way you meal prep your lunches and dinners each week. And right now, the only device that can do both pressure cooking and air frying, the much buzzed-about Ninja Foodi, just dropped to an all-time low price on Amazon. Move aside Instant Pot, there's a new sheriff in town.\n\nThe 8-quart Ninja Foodi is currently on sale for $189 on Amazon, which is the lowest price this size has ever been. Earlier this week, the 6.5-quart version was one of Amazon's featured Deals of the Day and was available for $120, but it sold out instantly. Usually retailing for $279, the Foodi rarely goes on sale as it is. If you've been considering adding an Instant Pot and air fryer to your kitchen's repertoire, why not get the best of both worlds in one fell swoop?\n\nThe new Ninja Foodi is similar to the Instant Pot in that it combines a ton of kitchen appliances\u2014including a pressure cooker, slow cooker, steamer, and rice cooker, for example, all into one. But no Instant Pot has the ability to air fry, and that's why the Foodi is such a game changer\u2014and was voted as our \"best upgrade pick\" when we tested the best pressure cookers.\n\nWhile we were wowed by its cooking performance, the main factors that hindered the Foodi from taking the top spot were its high price tag and bulky size. But with this sale, the Foodi is by far less expensive than buying both an Instant Pot and and air fryer, plus it will eliminate the need to have both on your countertop, so what's not to love?\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
