A Facebook representative told Axios that Zuckerberg was in Washington to meet with policymakers to talk about internet regulation. Facebook is facing ongoing pressure from regulators and lawmakers over privacy on the platform.\n\nBut Trump's passive tone on Twitter stands in stark contrast to some of his previous tweets from when he has met with Zuckerberg's competitors.\n\nHe met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, for example, in March and August. Trump initially praised their first meeting, saying it had \"ended very well,\" though he wrongly described Pichai as Google's president.\n\nBut by the time of their next meeting in August, the mood had changed. Trump sent out lengthy messages ridiculing Pichai, saying he was \"working very hard to explain how much he liked me\" and \"what a great job the Administration is doing.\"\n\nIn April, Trump also met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey just hours after he blasted the social-media platform over what he deemed as \"very discriminatory\" behavior against him, which he said included lowering his follower count. Twitter has altered its rules so that frozen accounts no longer show up in people's follower count.\n\nTrump praised his meeting with Dorsey as being a \"great meeting\" and said he looked forward to \"keeping an open dialogue.\"", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg held an unannounced meeting with President Donald Trump during Zuckerberg's visit to Washington on Thursday.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d849b242e22af456c6d6356-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
