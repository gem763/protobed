The $59.99 Indoor Cam has many of the same features as Ring\u2019s outdoor cameras, such as motion detection, two-way audio, and 1080p recording, but it\u2019s smaller and less expensive. If you\u2019re already a Ring customer, it\u2019s an easy addition to your setup if you\u2019re looking for a camera for inside your home that will integrate with the same app and cloud services you\u2019re already using. But if you\u2019re not already a Ring customer, there are even less expensive options that work just as well for an indoor security camera.\n\nThe Indoor Cam\u2019s design is similar to Ring\u2019s Stick Up Cam, just smaller. The Indoor Cam doesn\u2019t have the Stick Up Cam\u2019s battery or weather sealing; it has to be plugged into an outlet to function, and it isn\u2019t designed to be used outdoors at all. As a result, it takes up much less space on a shelf or mounted on a wall. The included base can be positioned on the bottom or the back of the camera providing the same amount of mounting options as Ring\u2019s other cameras.\n\nOur review of Indoor Cam Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Small, compact design\n\nEasy setup and management via Ring app\n\n1080p video and night vision Bad Stuff No battery means you have to run power to it\n\nNo archive of clips without paying for cloud storage\n\nEven less expensive options are available if you don\u2019t already have a Ring system Buy for $59.99 from Amazon\n\nLike the Stick Up Cam, the Indoor Cam can record 1080p video clips with audio, it has infrared sensors for low-light video, and it has adjustable motion detection zones. It supports two-way audio so you can speak to someone facing the camera through the Ring app on your phone, and the lens as a wide, 140-degree field of view. The night mode has both traditional black and white and color options.\n\nThe Indoor Cam can be accessed through the Ring app at any time for a live feed, but it will also record clips when it detects a motion event. This can be configured with adjustable sensitivity and range or disabled entirely. Similarly, the audio recording can be disabled.\n\nUsing the Indoor Cam is much like using any other indoor home security camera: you plug it in, set it up on your Wi-Fi network through the Ring app, and then access the video clips and live stream from your phone. Out of the box, the Indoor Cam will only offer live-streaming. To access recorded clips, you\u2019ll need to pay for a Ring Protect plan, which starts at $3 per month and provides a rolling 60-day archive of recorded clips. If you\u2019re already paying for Ring\u2019s Protect Plus plan at $10 per month for other Ring cameras, you can add as many Indoor Cams to it as you like for no additional monthly charge.\n\nAgree to Continue: Ring Indoor Cam Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. In order to set up and use the Ring Indoor Cam, you must create (or already have) a Ring account through the Ring app for Android or iOS. Creating an account involves agreeing to Ring\u2019s terms of service and privacy policy. It is not possible to use a Ring product without first agreeing to these things. If you add an integration to the Ring camera, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa assistant, you will also need to create an account with that integration and agree to its terms of service separately. Final tally: two mandatory agreements and however many optional agreements depending on what other services are linked to your Ring account.\n\nVideo quality is on par with other indoor cameras, which means it\u2019s perfectly fine for seeing what\u2019s going on inside your home when you\u2019re not there. The ability to have night clips in color is nice, but it\u2019s not a totally necessary function, and you can disable it if you find it isn\u2019t working well. The two-way audio works like other security cameras, too: it\u2019s kind of squawky and doesn\u2019t sound particularly great, but voices are clear and audible. I don\u2019t think Ring will be adding the ability to use the Indoor Cam as an Alexa speaker (despite being owned by Amazon) due to the speaker\u2019s limitations, however.\n\nIf you already have a Ring video doorbell and perhaps other Ring cameras outside of your home, the Indoor Cam is an easy and cheap way to add monitoring to the interior of your home, and it will integrate with the cloud services you\u2019re likely already paying for. But if you don\u2019t already have a Ring system and are just looking for a simple Wi-Fi-connected camera to put inside your home, then other brands, such as Wyze, offer many of the same features for less than half of the Indoor Cam\u2019s price.\n\nPhotography by Dan Seifert / The Verge", "description": "The Ring Indoor Cam is the company\u2019s first camera designed for inside your house.
