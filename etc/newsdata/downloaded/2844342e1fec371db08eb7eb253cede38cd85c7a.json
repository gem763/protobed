Two of the women who accused him of misconduct ahead of his hearing, Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, are also interviewed about their experiences with the Supreme Court justice.\n\nBut you might have heard about it only in the context of a highly controversial excerpt published in the New York Times \u201cSunday Review,\u201d the fallout from which has threatened to eclipse the news-making, revelatory information contained in the actual book: namely, that there had been yet another allegation of sexual misconduct leveled at Kavanaugh regarding his time at Yale reported to the Judiciary Committee, the circumstances of which seemed to back up Ramirez\u2019s account. And it was not investigated by the FBI.\n\nIn The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, a copy of which was obtained by the Cut before it was published today, Pogrebin and Kelly report that \u201cthe offices of at least two senators on the Judiciary Committee,\u201d in the run-up to Kavanaugh\u2019s impending confirmation hearings at the end of last September, \u201clearned that one of Kavanaugh\u2019s classmates, Max Stier, had seen a drunk Kavanaugh with his pants down at another freshman-year party where his friends brought Ramirez\u2019s drunk friend Tracy Harmon over and put Kavanaugh\u2019s penis in her hand.\u201d And they write that \u201cat least one other Yale student remembered hearing that Harmon had transferred out of Stiles residential college at Yale because of Kavanaugh, though exactly why is unclear.\u201d\n\nIn the book, the reporters note that \u201cHarmon, whose surname is now Harmon Joyce, has also refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends said she does not recall it.\u201d This is the piece of information that was somehow missing from the Times excerpt and that caused a conflagration among media outlets and pundits on both sides of the aisle. People like Sean Hannity saw the omission of the fact that Harmon Joyce does not herself accuse Kavanaugh of the offensive behavior as a sign of a partisan smear \u2014 especially because Stier, the man who says he witnessed it, was a member of Bill Clinton\u2019s legal team during the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998. Victim advocates and liberals critical of Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment were upset that it furnished such ammunition to his backers.\n\nSeveral things were strange about the Times excerpt in addition to the omission of Harmon Joyce\u2019s refusal to comment, which has now been added in an editor\u2019s note. Harmon Joyce wasn\u2019t named in the excerpt, and the account was buried in a long story about Deborah Ramirez\u2019s time at Yale called \u201cBrett Kavanaugh Fit in With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not,\u201d instead of as a piece of news in itself about an allegation not previously known to the public. (When asked about why the Times did not publish a separate news story, deputy editorial-page editor James Dao referred to an article that ran on the same day reporting on renewed calls for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment based on the excerpt.)\n\nUnfortunately, the controversy around the way the excerpt was packaged and edited has drawn attention away from what\u2019s actually in The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, and not just the new allegation. Pogrebin and Kelly uncovered crucial information about the hurried (or nonexistent) FBI investigations into both Blasey Ford and Ramirez\u2019s allegations before Kavanaugh was added for life to the Supreme Court. In a letter to the FBI before his confirmation, lawyers representing Ramirez and Ford outlined 13 potential witnesses for investigators to interview, including Stier. According to Pogrebin and Kelly, Stier and many others were never contacted and their accounts never investigated. That should be the news.", "description": "Drama surrounding a botched New York Times excerpt of \u2018The Education of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019 by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly threatens to eclipse its important revelations, namely, a new allegation of sexual misconduct and lack of FBI follow-up.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/16/16-brett-kavanaugh-b.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
