He also pledged a tax-cut for the middle class as \"the very first thing\" his new administration would put forward.\n\nIn Monday's election, the Liberals lost 20 seats, leaving them 13 short of an absolute majority in the 338-member Parliament. The main opposition Conservatives won 121 seats, with Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the New Democratic Party splitting the bulk of the remaining seats.\n\n\"I think Canadians sent a clear message across the election of multiple parties that affordability and the fight against climate change are really clear priorities that they want this Parliament to work on,\" the prime minister said Wednesday in his first news conference since the election.\n\n\"They also sent a clear message that they expect us as government to work with the other parties on these issues that matter to them, and that's exactly what we're going to do,\" he said.\n\nYouTube\n\nEven so, Trudeau, who said he would unveil his new Cabinet on Nov. 20, promised to move ahead with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, something the New Democrats and the Greens oppose but that Alberta \u2014 where the Liberals failed to win any seats \u2014 desperately wants.\n\nThe election results reflected a growing political divide between Canada's eastern and western provinces. Although it won fewer seats in Parliament than the Liberals, the Conservative Party received more votes overall.\n\nThe $5.5 billion 620-mile-long pipeline has attracted strong opposition from environmentalists and some indigenous groups, but it would give the western province, which has the world's third-largest oil reserves, direct access to Asian markets, bypassing U.S. refineries that now process 99% of its crude.\n\n\"For too long we have been selling our natural resources to the United States at a discount,\" Trudeau said. \"Getting our resources to markets other than the United States and getting that done as quickly as possible remains a priority.\"", "description": "The prime minister, whose Liberals lost their parliamentary majority in Monday's vote, says he will lead a minority government.
