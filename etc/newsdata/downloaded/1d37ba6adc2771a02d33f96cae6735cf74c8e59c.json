This marks the first meeting of top-10 teams at the Swamp since No. 5 Florida beat No. 9 South Carolina 44-11 in 2012. The matchup worth watching is how well Auburn\u2019s offensive line protects freshman quarterback Bo Nix. Auburn has allowed just six sacks all season. Florida has recorded 24 sacks to tie for the second-highest total of any Football Bowl Subdivision team. Auburn has won three straight in the series and hasn\u2019t lost to Florida since 2002.\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK\n\nGeorgia pass protection vs. Tennessee outside linebacker Darrell Taylor: No. 3 Georgia (4-0, 1-0) boasts arguably the nation\u2019s best offensive line and has allowed just one sack all season to match Air Force and Duke for the lowest total of any FBS team. Taylor recorded three sacks last season in a 38-12 loss to Georgia and will be looking to deliver another big performance Saturday to jump-start his senior season. Taylor has recorded only one sack so far this season after producing eight last year.\n\nNUMBERS GAME\n\nAlabama\u2019s DeVonta Smith tied an SEC single-game record by catching five touchdown passes last week in a 59-31 victory over Mississippi that catapulted the Crimson Tide to the No. 1 ranking. Other SEC receivers to catch five touchdown passes in a game are LSU\u2019s Carlos Carson against Rice in 1977, Vanderbilt\u2019s Earl Bennett against Kentucky in 2005 and South Carolina\u2019s Sidney Rice against Florida Atlantic in 2006. \u2026 Auburn has made 299 straight extra-point attempts, a streak that began in 2013. The Tigers are three away from the FBS record, as Florida State made 302 straight PAT attempts from 2012-16. \u2026 Georgia and No. 14 Iowa are the only FBS teams that have allowed zero touchdown runs this season. \u2026 Missouri\u2019s defense has scored four touchdowns in its last three games. \u2026 LSU\u2019s Joe Burrow leads all FBS players in completion percentage (.806). Burrow ranks second and Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa is third in passing efficiency.\n\nUPSET WATCH\n\nVanderbilt (1-3, 0-2) has beaten Ole Miss (2-3, 1-1) two of the last three years but heads into Oxford as a seven-point underdog Saturday. While true freshmen or redshirt freshmen have produced over 80 percent of Ole Miss\u2019 offense this year, Vanderbilt has plenty of senior playmakers in running back Ke\u2019Shawn Vaughn, receiver Kalija Lipscomb and tight end Jared Pinkney. Vanderbilt\u2019s experience at key spots could enable the Commodores to pull an upset on the road.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER\n\nFlorida outside linebacker and Louisville graduate transfer Jonathan Greenard has fit right in with the Gators while bouncing back from a wrist injury that sidelined him for nearly the entire 2018 season. Greenard made 15 \u00bd tackles for loss at Louisville in 2017 before getting hurt in the season opener last year. He leads the SEC in tackles for loss (6 \u00bd) and is tied for the conference lead in sacks (four). Greenard picked off a pass and recorded half a sack and three quarterback hurries last week in a 38-0 victory over Football Championship Subdivision program Towson.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Here are some things to watch during the sixth week of the Southeastern Conference football season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Megargee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/mississippi_st_auburn_football_95246_c0-125-2991-1868_s1770x1032.jpg?8ef5e157696515806b9c15d53a885f8186bc4c52"}
