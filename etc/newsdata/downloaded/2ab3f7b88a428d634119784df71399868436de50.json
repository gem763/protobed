Nick Watney and Lanto Griffin were both eight-under on the back nine.\n\nMexico\u2019s Carlos Ortiz was in the clubhouse on seven-under 137 after a 67, tied with Mark Hubbard who posted a 69.\n\nAustin Cook, who shared the first-round lead, was two-over through 15 holes but still just four shots off the pace.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Peter Malnati was five-under through his first five holes and stayed strong through a weather delay and tough, windy conditions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/32164e_american-peter-malnati-is-clubhouse-leader-in-weather-hit-us-pga-tour-houston-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
