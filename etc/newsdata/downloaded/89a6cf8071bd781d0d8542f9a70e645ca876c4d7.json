He had 57 recommendations, two ahead of the incumbent prime minister.\n\nHowever, Israel\u2019s president Reuven Rivlin, who is tasked after an election with picking a candidate to form a government, said on Monday morning that three Arab politicians from the Palestinian nationalist Balad party had abstained.\n\nHe confirmed the recommendations from the Joint List would account for only 10 endorsements, putting Netanyahu ahead by one recommendation.\n\nRivlin, whose role is usually ceremonial, is not obliged to pick Netanyahu. He can choose any candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a government. Usually, the decision is clear, and often goes to the leader of the largest party, but the muddied election result has created an impasse.\n\nThe president has also suggested that since neither Netanyahu or Gantz have a majority of 61 seats that they form a unity government together. He may summon the two men for talks before next Wednesday\u2019s deadline to choose a candidate.\n\nNetanyahu has backed that idea, although he has been coy about who would lead. Gantz has ruled out serving with Netanyahu, who is facing the prospect of three corruption indictments.\n\nQuick guide The police investigations swirling around Netanyahu Show Hide The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance. Case 1000 is an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne. Case 2000 is examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper. Case 3000 is an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\n\nCase 4000, the most serious, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.\n\nIf they do not join together, the president has the power to choose either, who will then have up to six weeks to form a majority government. If that person fails, Rivlin could then ask a second candidate.\n\nThat scenario played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance.\n\nMany fear a third election will be called in the current stalemate continues. Israel\u2019s apparent kingmaker, the far-right ultranationalist Avigdor Lieberman, has said he will not back either and also called for a unity government.\n\nSunday\u2019s endorsement of Gantz by Arab parties, while not giving him a clear lead, broke an almost-three-decade policy of not supporting an Israeli leader while the occupation in the Palestinians territories continues.\n\nThe last time Arab parties backed a candidate was in 1992, when they suported Yitzhak Rabin, who went on to sign the Oslo accords with the Palestinians. Palestinian citizens of Israel, or Arab Israelis, make up close to a fifth of the 9 million population.\n\nLeaders in the group made clear they were not backing Gantz, who led a devastating 2014 war on Gaza, but instead attempting to topple Netanyahu, whose election campaign focused on demonising Arab Palestinian citizens and who pushed for a law they say made them second-class citizens.\n\n\u201cWe have become illegitimate in Israeli politics in the Netanyahu era,\u201d the leader of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, told Rivlin when informing him of the endorsement. \u201cWe are this time recommending Benny Gantz to form the next government.\u201d\n\nThe prominent Arab parliament member Ahmad Tibi added: \u201cHistory is done: we\u2019ll do what is needed to bring down Netanyahu.\u201d", "description": "Israeli president tasked with choosing candidate to form Israel\u2019s next government after inconclusive election", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Raja Shehadeh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3361439d402414a22deeea5a8d1fd9355c0b656b/643_834_2499_1499/master/2499.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8ec25512a37514693312f431eb4e912c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
