Manasi Joshi, a para-badminton athlete was on the show along with Paralympic medallist Deepa Malik. It also happened to be host Amitabh Bachchan's birthday.\n\nManasi's case was a special one and the fact that she won Rs 25 lakh does not overshadow her struggle and achievement. Just over a month ago, she won the Para Badminton World Championships. In fact it was day before PV Sindhu won the World Championships and yet did not get as much media attention. But despite all that, Manasi's success is special.\n\nBWF\n\nHer life is no less then a Bollywood flick one would say. This was her first gold and she had started playing since she was 6. In 2011, she had an accident which crushed her left leg. The leg had to be amputated in order to prevent further damage. But Manasi was not disheartened and went on pursuing badminton as a hobby.\n\nShe got a prosthetic and started playing. Her return to the court in an office tournament in 2012 saw her win and she knew she could still play and play well. The training began and paid dividends when she secured silver in her first national level tournament in 2014.\n\nDon't Miss 121 SHARES 28.3 K SHARES 17 K SHARES 8.1 K SHARES 5 K SHARES\n\nKBC\n\nFrom then on there was no looking back. She won silver in the World Championships in 2015 and now she has won the gold. Athletes like her need to be cherished for they are putting that much of an extra effort.\n\nManasi is extremely successful on the court but it is her battle off it that is worth highlighting. Playing with one natural leg is not easy, coming back after an amputation takes a lot of courage, finding the will to keep on playing despite limitations requires grit. Manasi has battled all those odds to get where she is and while the likes of Sindhu do deserve their moment in the limelight, those like Manasi should not be pushed into the background. After all, they are representing us on the big stage and the least we can do is acknowledge their contributions.\n\nAll the best Manasi, keep it up and may more success come your way!", "description": "Kaun Banega Crorepati had some special guests on October 11 which is celebrated as International Day of the Girl Child.
