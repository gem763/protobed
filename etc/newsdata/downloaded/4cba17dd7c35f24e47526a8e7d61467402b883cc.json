It does not affect just British tourists but other nationalities as well,\u201d Grigoris Tassios told state TV ERT.\n\nHe said many hotels were expected to make losses on payments affecting vacation packages for the last two months, meaning \u201cmany millions of euros.\u201d\n\n\u201cUp to October 15 there are high occupancies, so we will suffer losses from this segment, too,\u201d Tassios said.\n\nHe said hotel companies would turn to the courts to try and recover money owed by Thomas Cook.\n\nThe company\u2019s collapse could be a blow to tourism in its biggest destinations, including Greece, leaving fuel suppliers out of pocket and forcing hundreds of travel agents to shut down across British high streets\n\nBut the Greek tourism confederation SETE said the industry has the depth and quality to overcome the hit. It called on the government to come up with specific measures to help companies absorb the problems that will arise.\n\nGreece has been experiencing an upsurge in tourism in the last years with a record number of 33 million visitors last year. Tourism accounts for about a quarter of economic output.", "description": "About 50,000 tourists are stranded in Greece, mainly on islands, after British travel firm Thomas Cook collapsed, a Greek tourism ministry official told Reuters on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
