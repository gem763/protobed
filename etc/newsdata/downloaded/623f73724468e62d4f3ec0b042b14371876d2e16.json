It attacked my brain, traveled to my spinal cord and paralyzed me from the neck down.\u201d\n\nNaegleria fowleri, or brain-eating amoebas as they are commonly called, are commonly found in warm freshwater, and infect people when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose, such as when swimming or diving in warm freshwater lakes or rivers. The amoeba then travels up the nose to the brain, where it destroys tissue, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). You cannot be infected by drinking contaminated water, but in rare instances, it can be found in poorly maintained swimming pools.\n\nNEW YORK CHILD DIES OF FLU, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY\n\nBrain-eating amoebas remain a rare occurrence in the U.S., with 34 infections reported in the U.S. between 2009 and 2018. Symptoms may mimic bacterial meningitis, and may begin about five days post-infection, but can start as early as the next day. Later symptoms may include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations, according to the CDC. The fatality rate is over 97 percent, with only four people out of a known 145 cases surviving.\n\nPerry spent months in the hospital before being transferred to an in-patient rehabilitation facility where he worked on gaining back his strength and has even regained the ability to stand. According to his sister, Perry began driving again and was able to return to work, but is still continuing with out-patient therapy.\n\n\u201cInitially it was, \u2018We\u2019re not sure if I\u2019m ever going to be able to walk again,\u2019 he told WMAR2News.com. \u201cI had a neurology appointment at the University of Maryland and my neurologist told me she can\u2019t believe the progress I\u2019ve made and she thinks I will make if not a full recovery pretty close to it.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn September, the family of a 10-year-old girl who had been on life support since contracting a brain-eating amoeba while swimming in a Texas river announced that she had died. Lily Mae Avant had been flown to Cook Children\u2019s Health Care System in Fort Worth after she was rushed to her local emergency room when she complained of a headache on Sept. 8. She was initially treated for both bacterial and viral meningitis, but a spinal tap revealed Naegleria fowleri.\n\nHer family had been hopeful that an antimicrobial medication called miltefosine would rid her of the amoeba, but she did not recover.", "description": "The fatality rate of Naegleria fowleri, or brain-eating amoebas, is over 97 percent.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Ryan-Perry-GoFundMe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
