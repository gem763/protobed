And this wouldn\u2019t be the first time Hill sold his number; he changed from No. 32 to 20 over the offseason when the team signed six-time Pro Bowler Eric Weddle.\n\nWhen asked about giving the number to Ramsey after Sunday\u2019s game against the Atlanta Falcons, Hill gave a coy response.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\"Nah, we ain't even do nothing,\" Hill said, smiling.\n\nAsked if he was going to ask for something, he said, \"We going to see what's up.\"\n\nAfter making $32,000 in the swap with Weddle, the reported figure of $20,000 would bring Hill\u2019s grand total to $52,000 \u2014 a thousand times the combined uniform numbers he gave up. And since he\u2019s due to make $1.775 million this season, he could essentially get a 3 percent raise for shuffling his numbers around.\n\nHill will now wear No. 22, which was recently vacated by Marcus Peters.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nRams cornerback Troy Hill has made $52,000 by selling his jersey number to teammates. (John McCoy/Getty Images)\n\nUniform numbers mean different things to each player. Some are to honor another person or just because they like the number. Hill has had a random assortment of numbers over the years, which probably made it easy to keep changing.\n\nHill wore No. 13 with the Oregon Ducks \u2014 he\u2019s not eligible to wear that number in the pros \u2014 before taking No. 28 with the Cincinnati Bengals in his rookie year. That brings us to 32, 20 and 22.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s a long history of pro athletes paying five-figure totals to get a favorite uniform number back with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback Darrelle Revis even shelling out $50,000. Maybe next time Hill can score a sports car, like when Deion Sanders bought one to get No. 21 on the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nJay Busbee contributed to this report.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Hill got $20,000 from Jalen Ramsey just months after he got $32,000 from Eric Weddle.", "authors": ["Ben Weinrib"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/93wTLRi3zx8yNLM.0_s18A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjMuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MoB6lGepMxpVgLF3OfKnmQ--~B/aD0zNDUyO3c9NDc4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/caefd7c0-f350-11e9-b5df-7402ee879659", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
