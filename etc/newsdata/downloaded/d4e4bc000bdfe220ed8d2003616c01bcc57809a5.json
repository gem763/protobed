But if you were expecting a few posters, streamers, fake cobwebs and plastic skeletons, think again. The \"Ghost Shibuya Store\" is by no means a half-hearted Halloween decoration job, beginning with the exterior:\n\nOnce inside, you'll notice the considerable effort they've put into the theme.\n\nMind the zombies when you go in.\n\nThe Ghost Whopper is essentially the Whopper, with its flame-broiled 100% beef patty, cheddar cheese, fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup and creamy mayonnaise but sandwiched between limited-edition ghostly white sesame buns infused with cheddar cheese flavor. The white color is achieved by baking the buns for a longer period of time at a lower temperature, creating a unique taste and a soft chewy texture.\n\nEven zombies are turning out in hordes to feast on this Halloween exclusive.\n\nGhost Whopper: 400 yen (including tax)\n\nGhost Whopper Set with medium drink: 500 yen (including tax)\n\nShibuya Ghost Store\n\nThe interior looks almost like the set from a zombie film:\n\nGet a free Whopper Jr\n\nIf you take a picture of yourself eating a Ghost Whopper and post it on Twitter or Instagram with the hashtags #burgerking and #halloween, and show it to the Shibuya Ghost Store staff on campaign days, you'll get a free Whopper Jr.\n\nThere's only one catch. You have to be \"dressed as a zombie.\" Since there are no further specifications, what qualifies as \"dressed as a zombie\" is probably open to interpretation. You don't have to break out the special effects kit if you don't want to.\n\nShibuya Ghost Store information\n\nName: Burger King Shibuya Ghost Store (Burger King Center Street)\n\nAddress (JP): \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u6e0b\u8c37\u533a\u5b87\u7530\u5ddd\u753a25-5 \u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30eb1F\n\nAddress (EN): 1F Center Bldg., 25-5 Udagawacho, Shibuya Ward, Tokyo\n\nDuration: October 23rd 10:00 to November 1st 05:00\n\nTelephone: 03-5489-5761\n\nFor more details about the Ghost Whopper, the Shibuya Ghost Store and the free Whopper Jr. social media promotion, visit the Shibuya Ghost Store special Halloween campaign page here.\n\nSource: PR Times\n\nRead more stories from grape Japan.\n\n-- Musical Calculator Gives Nostalgic Twist To Neon Genesis Evangelion And Legend Of Zelda Themes\n\n-- The Eerie Costumers Of Japan\u2019s Night Parade of One Hundred Demons\n\n-- New Micro Pig Cafe In Tokyo Lets You Cuddle With Piggy Staff\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://grapee.jp/en/\n\n\u00a9 grape Japan", "description": "Burger King Japan is channeling the spirit of Halloween this year with a zombie-themed promotion unlike any other.
