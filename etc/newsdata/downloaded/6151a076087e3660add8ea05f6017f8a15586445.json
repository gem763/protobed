Biden, his political rival, and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower\u2019s facts have been so incorrect about my \u2018no pressure\u2019 conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower\u2019s lawyer is a big Democrat,\u201d he added, although the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys have publicly highlighted conservative-leaning clients they\u2019ve represented.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS. Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted, referring to the inspector general for the intelligence community.\n\nDemocrats say they\u2019re worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s push to expose the whistleblower.\n\nThey say the person is entitled to anonymity and demonstrated credibility by accurately summarizing three key points from the Zelensky call.\n\nThe White House says the entire impeachment inquiry is a sham because Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have been boxed out of the process. It sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi late Tuesday saying it refuses to cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
