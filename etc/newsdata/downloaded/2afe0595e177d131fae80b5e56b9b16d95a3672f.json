Now, he\u2019s playing a new role for Pete Buttigieg\u2019s 2020 bid: rainmaker.\n\nChasten is slated to be the sole headline draw for several Pete for America fundraisers over the next month, starting with an event in Chicago this week. In October, Chasten will swing through New York City for another fundraiser, followed by a trip overseas to raise money from Americans living abroad in London on Oct. 22, according to event invitations obtained by POLITICO.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nChasten is also striking out on his own for other events, like a ribbon-cutting for a dozen new field offices in New Hampshire earlier this month, while Pete did the same for 20 offices in Iowa. The split-screen events show Chasten \u2014 a 30-year-old teacher who was nearly anonymous at the beginning of 2019 \u2014 cutting a campaign profile more akin to well-known former second lady Jill Biden than most 2020 spouses. And that prominence could be a force-multiplier for the Buttigieg campaign through the fall, keeping the fundraising spigot open while Pete stumps in all-important Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n\"Chasten is as big of a draw for people who want to connect with the campaign as Pete, and that\u2019s at all levels, not just high-dollar fundraisers,\u201d said John Atkinson, a Buttigieg donor based in Chicago. And, he added, \u201cto the extent that Chasten frees up bandwidth for the candidate, that is a competitive advantage.\"\n\nSpouses can \u201cspeak for the candidate in a way no other surrogate can,\u201d said Julianna Smoot, who led Barack Obama\u2019s finance team in 2008, when future First Lady Michelle Obama became a national draw.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Jill Biden has also been aggressively deployed as a surrogate for former Vice President Joe Biden, both in public campaign events and private fundraisers, while Doug Emhoff, Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 husband, has also headlined his own fundraisers. Jane Sanders has played a critical strategic role in her husband\u2019s political career, especially Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential runs. And Bruce Mann, Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s husband, occasionally lingers with reporters as he waits for his wife to navigate the often hours-long selfie line at the end of her campaign events.\n\nBut Buttigieg\u2019s campaign is leaning on Chasten to a notable extent, playing off his rise to social media stardom by ramping up his public schedule since this summer. That has freed Pete to spend less time courting donors \u2014 which he\u2019s done successfully, leading the Democratic field with nearly $25 million raised last quarter \u2014 and more time talking to voters in the early states, where the campaign is putting a heavy emphasis on building its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s something of a secret weapon for this campaign,\u201d Pete Buttigieg said in an interview with POLITICO. \u201cOne of the things you need to do on a campaign, especially when you\u2019re new on the scene, is introduce yourself and convey your values to as many people as possible. Chasten, through his own story and his own approach and his focus on making sure that people have a sense of belonging, really embodies a lot of the values of this campaign.\u201d\n\nChasten\u2019s spousal status stands out especially in its history-making context: He appeared on Time magazine\u2019s cover with an arm around Pete, under the headline \u201cFirst Family.\u201d\n\n\"Chasten is introducing America to what a same-sex couple looks like,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic consultant, who served as Barack Obama\u2019s deputy campaign manager and Michelle Obama\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cIn that, he does a remarkable job of humanizing Pete, a candidate who is already very relatable.\u201d\n\nThe Buttigieg donor invitations obtained by POLITICO show that Chasten\u2019s events cater to a mix of high- and low-dollar attendees. Tickets for the Sept. 24 event in Chicago range from $25 for \u201cyoung professionals\u201d up to $500 to be a co-host and guarantee a photo. In New York, \u201cCocktails and Conversation\u201d at a Manhattan residence will cost donors $500 to $1,000. Chasten has already held fundraisers in Miami, Tampa and St. Petersburg earlier this year.\n\nPete averages about $100,000 raised per event, while Chasten is expected to bring in about a third of that, according to a person familiar with the fundraising totals.\n\nThough Chasten appears frequently in private settings for the campaign, he has kept a low profile with the media. In May, the Washington Post wrote about Chasten\u2019s upbringing, including his stint as a homeless community college student in Michigan, and he sat for a rare interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cThis Morning\u201d alongside his husband \u2014 and their dogs.\n\nInstead, Chasten, who took a leave of absence from teaching to join the campaign full-time, developed his own unfiltered social media presence. He tweets like the millennial he is, deploying well-timed gifs and pop culture insights to more than 380,000 followers. Last week, Chasten dropped a Lizzo lyric and a Bachelor reference in a single tweet about his dog, Truman, who has earned his own Twitter handle.\n\n\u201cThere's a generational element to Chasten's appeal \u2014 creating a profile for himself on social media where we've gotten to know their pets, what they're doing on a daily basis,\u201d Cutter said. \u201cWe can debate the role Twitter plays in our politics, but Chasten's feed has been a lens into who Pete is. Nobody else is doing that quite like Chasten.\u201d\n\nThe massive field of candidates, coupled with the intense interest in the Democratic primary, may mean voters are \u201clooking at [spouses] earlier in the process than we\u2019ve seen in other primaries, and if yours is an asset \u2014 like the potential first husband \u2014 then you get him into rooms where he works best,\u201d said Henry Munoz III, the former Democratic National Committee finance chairman.\n\nBefore he started headlining his own fundraisers, Chasten would frequently introduce his husband at events, retelling a story about their first date, when Chasten asked Pete if he had aspirations for higher office. Pete, who had run for state treasurer in 2010, responded: Maybe another statewide run in Indiana?\n\nBut by their first wedding anniversary, the couple showed up on that Time magazine cover and Chasten adds, \u201cwith a wink, \u2018This isn\u2019t what I signed up for,\u2019\u201d according to several Buttigieg donors.\n\nThe campaign has also turned Chasten into a draw for other groups\u2019 events: On Sunday, he is co-headlining a champagne brunch fundraiser for the Victory Fund, the pro-LGBTQ group that supports political candidates and has endorsed his husband for president.\n\nSome attendees might be attracted by \u201cthe novelty \u2014 \u2018oh, it\u2019s a husband\u2019\u201d on the campaign trail, said Annise Parker, the former Houston mayor who is now Victory Fund\u2019s president.\n\nBut Parker added that Chasten offers a kind of alter ego to his husband, who can be \u201cpretty buttoned-down, reserved, a bit introverted,\u201d she said. \u201cChasten softens him up a little bit.\u201d\n\nChasten has also proven to be an adept public speaker, particularly in front of LGBTQ audiences. At the DNC\u2019s LGTBQ gala in June, Chasten replaced Pete for the keynote address at the last minute, after Pete returned to South Bend, Ind., when a black resident was shot and killed by a police officer.\n\n\u201cThe entire room looked at him and said to each other, \u2018Why isn\u2019t this guy running?\u2019\u201d said Munoz, who hasn\u2019t yet formally endorsed in the primary. \u201cHe plays the role of the spouse in a way that no one in American history ever has \u2014 and people want to meet him.\u201d", "description": "Pete Buttigieg\u2019s husband is now headlining fundraisers solo, helping power the mayor\u2019s 2020 campaign as he focuses on Iowa and New Hampshire.", "authors": ["Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9e/ba/b50e5b0f4a5fa24059ba1a37615a/19921-chasten-buttigieg-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
