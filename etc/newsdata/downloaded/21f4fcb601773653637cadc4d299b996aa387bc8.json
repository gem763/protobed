They can\u2019t deal with it.\u201d\n\nWhile his flair for riling up online edgelords is a recent discovery, the 29-year-old rapper and producer has been tinkering with his sound for more than a decade. Last year he finally broke through with his album, Veteran, bracing noise-rap with a radical lyrical agenda, rife with references to anime and video games, and jabs at everyone from Donald Trump\u2019s counsellor Kellyanne Conway to the television host and comedian Bill Maher. Now he is about to release the more melodic, but only occasionally less aggro, new album All My Heroes Are Cornballs.\n\nIt is a left turn that is a stunning expansion of his punk ethos \u2013 pushing his anti-establishment rhetoric to the brink, promoting a DIY ingenuity, embracing the counterculture \u2013 and yet another provocation.\n\nJpegmafia was born Barrington Hendricks in Brooklyn, New York. In his song Williamsburg, Jpeg reprimands the gentrifiers taking over the borough: \u201cWe taking Brooklyn back/You can leave the coffee,\u201d he snarls.\n\nThe irony of the fact that we are chatting in a coworking space in the Brooklyn area of Williamsburg called the Brass Factory, which has been converted from a real brass factory, is not lost on the rapper. His career has been about embracing contradictions, making noise music pushing a militant agenda of black self-defence to confused white audiences \u2013 radical rap to mosh to. Jpeg has been accused of being a troll or provocateur, but his rage raps are unambiguous about where his fury is from and where it is aimed.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to my music, you know who I\u2019m talking to, what I\u2019m talking about, and exactly what my message is,\u201d he says, wearing his signature black and red bandanna, combat boots and a T-shirt splicing the Gucci logo with the Rainbow Fish children\u2019s book character.\n\n\u201cThe only people who misinterpret it is goofy white niggas. People attach words like \u2018edgy\u2019 and shit like that to me. It\u2019s like yo, when has it ever been edgy for a black person to talk about black issues? Just because I\u2019m not doing it the way Common is, where I\u2019m like, \u2018Hug your mom\u2019 and shit.\u201d He pauses briefly, then smirks. \u201cBut also goofy white niggas come to my shows, so.\u201d\n\nJpeg got the creative spark aged 12, listening to the Cam\u2019ron album Come Home With Me at a friend\u2019s house. \u201cIt had a chipmunk [sped up] soul sample in it and I\u2019d never heard that before. It freaked me out. I thought it was the best shit I\u2019d ever heard.\u201d At 13, he was uprooted to Alabama, in the deep south, a jarring transition that provided an education in racism. \u201cI had to deal with a lot of vitriol immediately,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt benefited me in a way because it just made me hard.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jpegmafia at the Pitchfork 2019 festival in July in Chicago.

He served one term in the US Air Force, during which he was deployed to Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, North Africa and Japan. He says being poor and black is all that prompted him to join up. \u201cA recruiter came to school and I was like, \u2018I have no other option, I can either die here or ... at least this will get me out of my situation,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not some patriot. I didn\u2019t have some yearning to defend my country or anything. I was poor. And I was taken advantage of, really.\u201d\n\nHe remembers his time overseas as \u201cextremely scary\u201d and the military as a club of dick-swinging jocks. A reluctant black soldier caught between the service arm of white American nationalism and its hatred of the Middle East, he describes serving abroad as \u201cbeing swept up in some shit you didn\u2019t start\u201d. The military was isolating. \u201cWhen they write their rules, they don\u2019t think about black people, so it\u2019s not meant for black people.\u201d\n\nHe would never recommend it, but the air force reinforced his tireless work ethic. He had a computer and made beats in tiny spaces under the immense stress of intermittent combat. Deployed during the filesharing era, Jpeg had access to an endless cache of digital music but barely enough broadband speed to process much of it. He would spend whole weekends listening to anything he had managed to download: Kanye\u2019s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Wiz Khalifa\u2019s Kush & Orange Juice, Rick Ross\u2019s Teflon Don; Ariel Pink, country music. With an eclectic and voracious musical appetite, he started releasing music as Devon Hendryx in 2011. After a string of unsuccessful rap mixtapes, he turned to making lo-fi \u201cfreak folk\u201d as Ghost Pop. \u201cThat\u2019s the most unconfident album I ever made,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all depressed and suicidal. That\u2019s the last time I think I ever drop my guard on record.\u201d\n\nWhen they write their rules, they don\u2019t think about black people Jpegmafia on the military\n\nHe cut his teeth doing live shows at small house parties in Japan. What little buzz the band garnered locally made him feel validated in his decision to pursue music.\n\nHendricks changed his name to Jpegmafia, moved to Baltimore and was there during a series of riots sparked by the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man who fell into a coma while he was being transported in a police van. \u201cIt was a ghost town. Shit was on fire. Cops were acting crazy. It felt like war.\u201d The turmoil inspired his 2015 EP Darkskin Manson, with venomous songs such as Cops Are The Target and I Wipe My Ass With Confederate Flags.\n\nJpeg says he admired the righteous anger permeating the city. \u201cI respected that Baltimore was like, \u2018We\u2019re not going to march. We\u2019re going to break shit.\u2019 Because that\u2019s how shit gets done. That\u2019s how America was started. No one is so nice that they\u2019re going to listen to your empathetic views, especially not police that shoot 12-year-olds for having play [toy] guns. So there\u2019s no reason to not turn up on people like that.\u201d His music bristles with that same indignation.\n\nJpegmafia\u2019s music began to resonate on the Baltimore scene, leading to the raving punk rap of Veteran. It only took him half his life but he is finally a professional rapper. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m 29 and people are just now hearing about me is because there\u2019s no bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have a manager who\u2019s secretly on Interscope. I\u2019m the complete opposite of an industry plant. I\u2019ve been doing this since I was 15 years old and nobody cared till I was 28. If I was a different person, I\u2019d be bitter, to be honest.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jpegmafia\u2019s performance at Roskilde festival in Denmark, July 2019. Photograph: Joseph Okpako/Redferns\n\nHe brings up Nick Drake, the singer-songwriter who died aged 26 in 1974. \u201cHe died alone and a nobody. It wasn\u2019t until 20 years later that people got it. Now there\u2019s whole artists that sound like him, that have careers based off of his style. And he\u2019ll never know because people couldn\u2019t catch on fast enough.\u201d\n\nFortunately for Jpeg, people caught on to Veteran and now, living in Los Angeles, the rapper is dealing with fame. The subtext of All My Heroes Are Cornballs is that every celebrity is human and will inevitably let you down. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a baseline. Like, let\u2019s get this out the way: All your heroes are fucking cornballs. Don\u2019t put so much faith in these niggas you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHe cites his own idol, Kanye West \u2013 who produced the Common song that inspired him aged 12 \u2013 but is reluctant to judge his pro-Trump pronouncements, warning that he may also, much to his chagrin, end up saying stupid things when he is 40. His message is not to put people on pedestals at all.\n\nHe has a note on his phone with random thoughts and songs that helped inspire the record\u2019s energy, including the phrase \u201ckill all snitches\u201d, Smile by the Beach Boys, TLC\u2019s FanMail, Everything But the Girl, Bj\u00f6rk and, of course, Cam\u2019ron. He denies there\u2019s any sort of theme, but says the record is introspective. \u201cI took that antagonistic figure I pointed at people and pointed it at myself instead,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI wanted it to be more like centred around myself, so that if this is the introduction people are getting, I\u2019m giving them the most honest thing right off the bat. So we ain\u2019t gotta sign a prenup afterwards. You know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d\n\nJpeg knows what it is like to be an outsider \u2013 in the deep south, in the military, as a rap oddity \u2013 and he knows what it is like to be justifiably angry. He wants his music and his shows to be outlets for those emotions. \u201cBlack people got shit to actually be mad about,\u201d he points out. \u201cA lot of these dudes in metal, they\u2019re just mad at the world because, like \u2026 who even knows? But I want to create a space for these invisible black people \u2013 where niggas who have genuine shit to be mad about can come and be actually mad about it. I just want it to be communal: we\u2019re all here and we\u2019re all weird and we\u2019re all, like, fucked up and depressed.
