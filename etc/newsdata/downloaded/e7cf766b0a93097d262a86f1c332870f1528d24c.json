Peyper was excluded from consideration for semi-final duty, and so it probably safe to assume that his tournament is at an end.\n\nThere is a certain irony there in that, like Vahaamahina before him, Peyper has been culpable of a momentary lapse in judgement that has ended in total catastrophe. The brutality of World Cups lies in their breath-taking finality, the idea that once you err there is no way back, and this applies to officials as much as it does to players. No matter that Peyper got virtually every big call right during the quarter-final and has been one of the outstanding referees in the tournament. At this level, one strike and you\u2019re out.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere will be those who lament this state of affairs as a gross overreaction to what was essentially a harmless offence (and for all the chagrin on the French side, show me a genuine victim here). Certainly that was what Warren Gatland was getting at on Monday when he decried the culture of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d that had led to Peyper\u2019s suspension. Personally, though, I\u2019m less interested in the simple morality of Peyper\u2019s actions than in the economy of the process: this curious business of seeing and being seen, of fame and scrutiny, of infamy and punishment, the culture in which simple human lapses are exploded into gigantic character flaws.\n\nAt the heart of this lies the increasing \u2018celebrification\u2019 of officials, across a range of sports, but arguably in rugby union more than anywhere else. The increasingly esoteric laws of the game, which hand a greater responsibility for subjective interpretation, as well as innovations such as Ref Mic, has unwittingly turned referees into a sort of personal brand: not merely an arbiter or custodian of the game, but a protagonist and a performer in their own right.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images 2/31 <b>Wales:</b> Liam Williams - 6 France did an excellent job of kicking away from him to limit his involvement, with few chances to show what he can do. Getty Images 3/31 George North - 6 Excellent tackle stopped Fickou early on, but was intercepted by Huget when Wales had a three-man overlap as they were desperately searching for the try. Didn\u2019t have a great game by all accounts, but then not many in red did. AFP via Getty Images 4/31 Owen Watkin - 5 Had big shoes to fill in Jonathan Davies\u2019s last-minute absence, but didn\u2019t show his best and showed what Wales lose without Davies in the side. Getty Images 5/31 Hadleigh Parkes - 5 Made no impact whatsoever with ball in hand and the fact that he was thumped backwards by Huget sums up the Welsh performance. Getty Images 6/31 Josh Adams - 6 Tried to come off his wing in an effort to get involved in the game but could not find anything come his way as he was starved of ball. World Rugby via Getty Images 7/31 Dan Biggar - 6 100 per cent record from the tee and his kicking from hand was average, if not good, but will need to work out how to get his back line firing again. At least he showed o signs of the recent concussions he\u2019s suffered. AFP via Getty Images 8/31 Gareth Davies - 5 Didn\u2019t look his normal lively self as France contained him around the fringe, and he made no impact off the defensive line in attempting his trademark interceptions. REUTERS 9/31 Wyn Jones - 5 Quiet in attack, quiet in defence, Just quiet, really. AP 10/31 Ken Owens - 6 Wales\u2019s most prominent defender as he led the tackling charts. Breathed a huge sigh of relief when his intercepted 25-metre pass was ruled inconsequential due to a knock-on advantage, as Guirado galloped over for what he thought was France\u2019s fourth try. REUTERS 11/31 Tomas Francis - 5 Conceded a penalty early on and struggled in the scrum, though contributed well in defence. REUTERS 12/31 Jake Ball - 6 Made one impactful tackle that sent the French into reverse, but his place is coming under threat from the returning Adam Beard. AFP via Getty Images 13/31 Alun Wyn Jones - 6 Got little change out of the French defence with the ball in hand, but his defensive effort was at the highest degree that we\u2019ve come to expect. REUTERS 14/31 Aaron Wainwright - 7 Sprung into life to snap up the loose ball and gallop away for his try that kicked Wales into life with a much-needed score to stem the flow. Was on the receiving end of Vahaamahina\u2019s disgraceful elbow in the second half, but on the whole it was another good showing from the youngster. AFP via Getty Images 15/31 Justin Tipuric - 6 Played a key role in the match-winning try by catching the rip and taking it to the line. Spent a lot of time out wide, which didn\u2019t always help his side. Getty Images 16/31 Josh Navidi - 5 Suffered a hamstring injury in the first half that forced him off. Replacement Ross Moriarty joined him minutes later when he was sent to the sin-bin, though he redeemed himself with the match-winning try. Getty Images 17/31 <b>France:</b> Maxime Medard - 7 Kicked smartly until his rash decision to attempt a drop-goal from halfway saw him grubber the ball instead. Part of a French back line that dazzled throughout the first half as he caused Wales all sorts of problems with his offloading in the tackle. AFP via Getty Images 18/31 Damian Penaud - 7 On another day he could have scored a hat-trick, but he did set up a beauty for Vakatawa as he split Biggar and Owens before offloading to the centre. He was guilty of dropping one with the line in front of him in the second half. AFP via Getty Images 19/31 Virimi Vakatawa - 8 Possibly his best performance in a France shirt. He caused all sorts of problems for the Welsh defence, scoring a try himself and knocking Biggar into next week with one emphatic charge. AFP via Getty Images 20/31 Gael Fickou - 8 Made a superb start to the match as he ran riot with Ntamack, cutting through the gaps left in the Welsh line. Could have scored early on had it now been for North\u2019s excellent tackle. EPA 21/31 Yoann Huget - 6 Made a thumping tackle on Parkes and intercepted North crucially when Wales had a three-man overlap, but otherwise he was strangely quiet. AFP via Getty Images 22/31 Romain Ntamack - 8 Ran the show throughout the first half with a stunning display of running rugby. Brought his outside backs into play beautifully that Wales simply could not contend with. Played a key role in Ollivon\u2019s try that will go down as one of the best at the tournament. AFP via Getty Images 23/31 Antoine Dupont - 7 Mixed up his play well with a blend of runs and kicks. Was on hand to take an offload from Ntamack and feed Ollivon to score the second try. AFP via Getty Images 24/31 Jefferson Poirot - 7 Won a penalty against Francis early on and made a strong contribution defensively. You could visibly see the role he\u2019s taken on within this team as he tried to lead the pack. PA 25/31 Guilhem Guirado - 6 Lost possession of the ball in contact with Ball that lead to Wainwright\u2019s breakaway try. Reliable in the lineout but disappointed slightly with his carrying. Decision to replace him straight after the red card was a puzzling one. AFP via Getty Images 26/31 Rabah Slimani - 7 Stood strong in the scrum, but needed to do more with the ball and missed two tackles. Getty Images 27/31 Bernard le Roux - 6 In the unfamiliar position of lock that stemmed his talents around the ruck. REUTERS 28/31 Sebastien Vahaamahina - 3 Got the ball rolling with the opening try of the game, only to go from hero to villain with a stupid deliberate elbow to the head of Wainwright that earned him a straight red card and swung the game in Wales\u2019s favour. AFP via Getty Images 29/31 Wenceslas Lauret - 6 Ran good support lines on occasion but could have done more defensively when the going got tough. AFP via Getty Images 30/31 Charles Ollivon - 7 On the shoulder of Dupont to inherit the ball and finish from range for the second try, and nearly found himself with another chance soon after in chasing a loose ball. A good showing. AFP via Getty Images 31/31 Gregory Alldritt - 7 Stood out with Ollivon in the back-row as he made important runs for his side.

AFP via Getty Images\n\nNobody plays this game better than Nigel Owens, of course, and it has barely been possible to navigate this tournament without coming across one of his adverts for the official World Cup airline partner, in which he sternly blows his whistle at errant passengers who cut in line, or make too much of a fuss in their seats. Owens has a fair claim to be the most well-known official in sport, with a talk show, a newspaper column, hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers and a considerable body of work on YouTube.\n\nIn a recent feature-length interview with the New York Times \u2013 yes, the New York Times \u2013 he told a story about travelling to Fiji and suddenly hearing somebody shouting his catchphrase \u2013 \u201cthis is not soccer!\u201d \u2013 at him from across the street.\n\nMeanwhile, since hanging up his whistle Alain Rolland has used his platform within the game to carve out a moderately successful niche as a motivational business speaker. \u201cAs a business consultant, Alain has a range of approaches that will up-skill your management and sales teams,\u201d his personal website boasts. \u201cAlain\u2019s motivational presentations and courses provide practical advice based on his own personal experiences both on and off the pitch.\u201d\n\nPeyper, from what I can discern, is some way short of that level. He doesn\u2019t seem to have given too many interviews and certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be publicly active on social media. He was steeped in rugby tradition from an early age, attending Grey College in Bloemfontein, the likes of CJ van der Linde and Jannie du Plessis among his contemporaries, and although he played the game as a youth, by his own admission he was never much good. His size counted against him, leaving him, as he put it, \u201cbroken into several pieces by the time he was 20\u201d.\n\nThus refereeing became his calling, and by all accounts one that came naturally to him. He was officiating Super Rugby games while still in his 20s, an international referee by the age of 32, a first World Cup at 35. And as he walked into Oita train station after Sunday\u2019s quarter-final, he will have known that in a climate where referees are perhaps under more pressure than ever \u2013 tournament organisers even took the rare step of criticising their performance in the early stages \u2013 he was a strong candidate to take on the final if South Africa failed to make it.\n\nAnd so: what on earth made him do it? Ultimately, Peyper\u2019s errant elbow was not a failure of comic judgement \u2013 because, if you think about it, it\u2019s absolutely hilarious \u2013 but of self-perception. Having finished work for the day, he walked into that train station as Jaco Peyper, regular bloke. What he failed to realise was that in today\u2019s game, no figure in the public eye has that luxury, not even referees. Fame, however fleeting or minuscule, is a coat you can\u2019t simply slip off. As celebrities the world over quickly learn, you don\u2019t have to be on duty to be on trial.\n\nOnce the photo was public, Peyper\u2019s fate was sealed. In the kangaroo court of social media, no misdemeanour, however small, may ever be allowed to go unpunished. And there\u2019s an acrid lesson there for anyone with even a modicum of recognition value: the eyes are everywhere, the lenses are unforgiving, and the judgements will be merciless. Peyper isn\u2019t the first person to learn that the hard way, and he certainly won\u2019t be the last.", "description": "A few years back, Jaco Peyper gave an interview to a South African radio station in which he explained that being an international referee is not the sort of career you take up if you want to make friends. \u201cIf you\u2019re a referee and you want to be a hero, you\u2019re in the wrong place,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not part of the job.\u201d", "authors": ["Jonathan Liew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/09/jaco-peyper-celeb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
