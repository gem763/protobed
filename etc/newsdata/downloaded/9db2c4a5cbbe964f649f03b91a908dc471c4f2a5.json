This is a distillation of everything my dad wanted to achieve on this ship.\n\n\"He wanted diners to come in to this space and almost feel the saliva glans begin to build as they looked at these paintings.\"\n\nAs well as the paintings on the wall, Alexander Goudie designed all the elements of the restaurant, with designs on the paper plates, napkins, sandwich bags, soap boxes, plastic bags and menus all showcasing Goudie's artistry.\n\nLooking through the huge body of work on the ship also gave Lachlan the chance to reflect on his relationship with his father.\n\n\"He was a tough cookie\u2026 he could be a bit of a nightmare to be around. But he loved life and he loved painting.\n\n\"It was inspiring to be this person\u2019s son.\"", "description": "Lachlan Goudie visits collection of dad's work aboard the Bretagne ferry", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07mjfnv.jpg"}
