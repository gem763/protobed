Yeah, take that guys who make the decisions!.'\n\nKriski then intervened in the discussion, saying: 'I think there's a lot of 58-year-old comedians that are working out there.'\n\nBut Griffin fired back: 'Name five women'.\n\n'I'm not, uh, into the comedy thing,' Kriski replied.\n\n'What's with the new guy?' Griffin quipped, failing to realize that Kriski has worked at the station for more than two decades.\n\n'The point is, it's a male dominated field...I don't really want to hear your take on that.\n\nKriski then countered: 'We've got guests here every day.'\n\nShe then said: 'That's alright, but you should know your stats though. Anyway, working in a male dominated field is something where I deal with that sort of thing every day.'\n\nMotioning over to Kriski, she added: 'I spend most of my day trying to talk to older white guys and explain I just want to do what I do.\n\n'I don't feel like, no matter how you feel about me or the photo, nobody in America should have the president and the Department of Justice make it so that they're not employable or insurable.'\n\nAt this point Rubin cut in to conclude the interview. 'After all this is done and the movie has this worldwide distribution, do you anticipate you'll find paid work?,' he asked.\n\nGriffin previously complained that she was left 'unemployable and uninsurable' after her infamous photo with an effigy of Donald Trump's severed head in 2017\n\nShe deals with the fallout from the 2017 Donald Trump controversy in the feature film, 'Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story' which is part documentary, part comedy special\n\nShe responded:'I don't know, Sam, I'm going to be honest.

If you take a photo like that, you didn't break the law.\n\n'I didn't violate the First Amendment in any way. If you take a photo like that, you didn't violate the First Amendment in any way.'\n\nIn the wake of the photo she also had to buy metal detectors because 'there were all kinds of incidents. A guy came at me with a knife in Houston,' she said.\n\nThe two-time Emmy winner claimed she had been under investigation by federal authorities into whether she was a credible threat.\n\nShe then said that she was put under federal investigation, and even put on the no-fly list while also being 'interrogated under oath... which has never happened in the history of this country.'\n\n'The President and the Department of Justice shouldn't make you unemployable and uninsurable,' she said.\n\nGriffin's troubles began in May 2017 when she posed with the bloodied mask in a photo-shoot with photographer Tyler Shields\n\nThe comedian said she faced threats and been approached by a man with a knife after posting the controversial Donald Trump image\n\nThe scandal erupted in May 2017 when Griffin posed with the bloodied mask in a photoshoot with photographer Tyler Shields.\n\nGriffin, now 58, captioned it with a reference to 'blood coming out of his wherever' - a play on Trump's controversial comments about TV host Megyn Kelly.\n\nBut the photo was widely understood as a threat about the President's violent death.\n\nShe faced condemnation from across the political spectrum, including from the President himself who said Griffin 'should be ashamed of herself'.\n\nTrump called the stunt 'sick', adding that his young son Barron was 'having a hard time with this'.\n\nGriffin was dropped from CNN's New Year's Eve show and co-host Anderson said the photo was 'clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate'.\n\nShe had been the co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve broadcast for 10 years before she was fired in the aftermath of the photo.\n\nThe comedian initially retreated, admitting she had gone 'way too far' and asking for 'forgiveness'.\n\nBut she has since reversed her apology.
