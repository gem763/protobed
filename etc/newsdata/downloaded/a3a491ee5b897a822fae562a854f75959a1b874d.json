In a break with some US allies, Trump supports Russia's re-instatement without any conditions.\n\nThese developments come as Trump prepares to travel to Europe this week for the G7 summit in Biarritz, France.\n\nThe Danish prime minister said Trump's apparent interest in purchasing the autonomous territory was \"absurd,\" explaining that \"Greenland is not for sale.\"\n\nIn response to the prime minister's remarks, Trump tweeted, \"Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting.\"\n\nThe prime minister expressed \"regret and surprise\" at Trump's decision.\n\n\"I think it's sad, honestly, because this is just not the way you treat an ally,\" former US ambassador to Denmark during the Obama administration Rufus Gifford told CNN.\n\nThe former ambassador added that he \"had the great responsibility of going to the Danish government and requesting troops to go to Iraq, to Syria. And they went and they fought alongside our troops and they died alongside our troops.\"\n\n#Denmark was one of our first coalition partners to fight #ISIS. In 2014, its Special Forces deployed to western Iraq with us when few others would dare go there. Our @coalition would not have succeeded without them. Valued parter in arms, founding member of @NATO, & vital ally. \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) August 21, 2019\n\nDenmark has been a steadfast US ally, one that has played a role in impeding progress on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany, a project to which the Trump administration is firmly opposed. Denmark has repeatedly caused headaches for Russia in this area.\n\nAs Trump insulted Denmark, he made the comment that it would be \"much more appropriate\" to have Russia back in the G7. \"I could certainly see it being the G8 again,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday.\n\nThe president suggested that the reason Russia was expelled was because Russian President Vladimir Putin \"outsmarted\" former President Barack Obama, who he said apparently \"thought it wasn't a good thing to have Russia in\" and \"wanted Russia out.\"\n\nRussia was added to the G7, which then became the G8, when the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany, and Japan made the decision to include it in 1998. It was kicked out 16 years later in order to impose a cost on Russia for its actions in Ukraine.\n\nTrump pushed for Russia to be let back into the group last year. \"Russia should be in this meeting,\" he said. \"They should let Russia come back in because we should have Russia at the negotiating table.\"\n\nThis is a pattern of behavior by Trump that has been seen over and over again. Earlier this month, for instance, the president made the decision to side with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over long-time US ally South Korea. As the US and South Korea conducted joint drills, Trump said he didn't care for the joint military exercises designed to strengthen the US-South Korean alliance - drills North Korea sharply criticises.\n\n\"I never liked it. I don't like paying for it,\" Trump explained, adding, \"We should be reimbursed for it.\"\n\nThe president regularly criticises allies and partners for not paying what he considers to be their fair share for US defense commitments, which Trump characterises as one-sided deals. Throughout his presidency, long-standing alliances have been treated less as valuable partnerships and more as business transactions.\n\nTweeting Wednesday, Trump again slammed NATO allies for not paying enough for collective defense, calling the situation \"very unfair to the United States.\"\n\nIn separate tweets, he criticised Demark, a \"wealthy country' for only spending 1.35 percent of its GDP on the NATO alliance. \"We protect Europe and yet, only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are at the 2% mark,\" he said, stressing that countries like Denmark are \"still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "As Trump prepares to head to Europe, he is snubbing a close ally while reaching out to a top rival.
