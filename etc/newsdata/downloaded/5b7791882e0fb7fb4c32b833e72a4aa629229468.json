They got off to a hesitant start but have dominated since the dawn of the turbo-hybrid era in 2014.\n\nSunday\u00b4s win was their 99th in Formula One, including those from when they last competed as a fully-fledged constructor in 1954 and 1955.\n\nThey have scored 86 of those victories in the last six seasons, with their biggest haul coming in 2016 when they won 19 of 21 races.\n\n\"I could spend a whole day trying to analyse what I think are the strengths of the group,\" said Wolff.\n\n\"But there are just too many factors and so many faces come into my mind that I see through the year that are happy and tired.\" (Editing by Alan Baldwin, editing by Christian Radnedge)", "description": "By Abhishek TakleSUZUKA, Japan, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Formula One champions Mercedes are wondering how far they can go after securing an unprecedented sixth...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
