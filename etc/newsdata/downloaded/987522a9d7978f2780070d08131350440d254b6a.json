The greatest war story ever told was one of two highly heralded platforms: iPhone versus Android. They\u2019re in constant competition, and there\u2019s never a shortage of shade, whether it\u2019s Apple dropping a truth bomb about Android\u2019s flip-a-switch privacy during its WWDC \u201919 keynote, or Google showing off the prowess of its integrated AI smarts at its developer event.\n\nWhatever smartphone you\u2019re using, you\u2019re bound to find similarities in features. That\u2019s because like in fashion, there are trends, and Apple and Google are setting the bar. Both companies have major software updates dropping this week \u2014 iOS 13 and Android 10, respectively. Both updated platforms will usher in a variety of new abilities you\u2019ll quickly find you can\u2019t live without. (As long as you update your software, of course.)\n\nAndroid 10 Launch: Australian Release Date, Features And Install Guide After months of drip-fed information, alluring betas and a very sensible name reveal, Android 10 is officially available for Google Pixel smartphones - with other models soon to follow. It's a feature-packed update that every Pixel owner should download ASAP. Here's what you need to know. Read more\n\nDark mode\n\nAndroid Q\u2019s Dark Mode is most certainly A Mood. (Screenshot: Florence Ion)\n\nDevelopers of both platforms cheered in unison when Apple and Google respectively announced that there would be a dark interface coming to their platforms. That\u2019s likely because there are many out there feeling burnt out by the brightness of their screens.\n\niOS 13 and Android 10 will come equipped with a system-wide dark mode. All menu screens, buttons, and fonts will adhere to a darker colour scheme, along with notifications panels and pop-ups, and the dock in iOS. All of Apple and Google\u2019s first-party apps will support the feature on each of their platforms.\n\nThe Best IOS 13 Tricks You Haven't Tried Yet I\u2019ve been playing around with iOS 13 since the developer beta first launched\u2014bugs and all. Since it\u2019s now available for public consumption, I thought I\u2019d share a few of my favourite new tricks so you can get excited while you wait for the beta to install on your device. Read more\n\nReminders\n\nApple announced a revamp of the Reminders app in iOS 13. The app will feature new categories to help separate tasks by urgency, as well as a new AI-propelled feature that will remind you when it\u2019s time to do the thing you planned to do.\n\nAndroid 10 will already have this ability inherited through the Google Assistant app, which lets you start off a command with, \u201cHey Google, remind me to...\u201d. And since it\u2019s linked to the Assistant, the reminder will pop up on your phone, and from your smart speaker, and in your Chrome browser (though only if you want it to).\n\nRobust privacy features\n\nBoth Android Q and iOS 13 are getting their own version of robust permissions settings. (Screenshot: Florence Ion)\n\nAt I/O, Google announced a heaping of features coming to Android 10 (then code-named 'Android Q') related to privacy. We won\u2019t know the extent of them until the software is final, though in the latest versions of Android you can already adjust individual permissions by the app.\n\niOS 13 will have similar abilities where you can choose how often to give your location data to a particular app, so it\u2019s not pinging when you\u2019re not using your phone. In a one-up move on Google, Apple also introduced the \u201cSign in with Apple\u201d feature, which will let iPhone users create new accounts and log into them using Face ID. Apple accounts will also be able to create throwaway email addresses for different apps, helping cut down on spam in your inbox.\n\nHow To Download The iOS 13, macOS Catalina And iPadOS Public Betas The public betas for iOS 13, macOS Catalina, iPadOS and tvOS 13 are all now available. Here\u2019s a quick recap of how to sign up, and what testers can expect from these beta builds. Read more\n\nImproved Maps\n\niOS 13 will have its own version of Google Maps\u2019 Street View feature, called Look Around. (Image: Apple)\n\nApple Maps is finally getting the Street View it deserves, except that it\u2019s called Look Around. It works similarly to the feature in Google Maps, allowing you to pan around, take a walk down a virtual street, and scan for monuments.\n\nThere\u2019s also a Share ETA feature coming to iOS 13. Like the option in Google Maps, you can send out a link to a friend to temporarily follow along your route, until you get to your destination. Unfortunately, it\u2019s unlikely sending a link from Apple Maps to your Android-using friend will work, as the app is not available in the Google Play Store.\n\nThe Best New Features In Android 10 [Updated] Android 10 \u2014 formerly Android Q \u2014 is starting to roll out to compatible handsets. Whether you have it or are waiting to get it, here are all the major features and changes worth knowing about. Read more\n\nSwipe typing\n\nApple\u2019s version of swipe-typing is called Quick Path. (Image: Apple)\n\nSwipe typing, where you use your thumb to swipe across the keyboard and pray the prediction engine catches your gist, isn\u2019t new to the iPhone. But in iOS 13, the ability will become native. Apple named its version Quick Path.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gboard keyboard app (also for iOS) has already had the feature for years, not to mention third-party apps like SwiftKey and Swype. At least now you won\u2019t have to download an app to enable it on the iPhone.\n\nPhotos\n\nGoogle Photos can already facilitate in rotating your video for you. (Screenshot: Florence Ion)\n\niOS 13 will include new editing tools for photos and videos. You\u2019ll be able to edit elements like brilliance, shadows, highlights, contrast, saturation, white balance, sharpness, and definition. There\u2019s also a vignette and noise reduction feature. And for quick edits, videos can be rotated from the Photos app.\n\nAndroid 10 has similar editing prowess for photos and videos by way of Google Photos. The app lets you crop and tweak photos and trim videos that are too long for social media.\n\nWhen Is Your Smartphone Getting Android 10? Now that we have an official name for Android Q, we\u2019re getting very close to the official release of the new operating system. It's definitely hitting soon, but with an important caveat \u2014 just because Google releases Android 10 doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re going to get it (unless you own a Pixel device). Here's what you need to know. Read more\n\nOn-device data\n\nThis is not likely to be something you see advertised in a TV commercial. One outstanding trend in the mobile world is the idea of shrinking data so that it can be stored locally to help reduce reliance on the cloud. Apple and Google, in particular, have figured out how to compress gigabytes of files into mere kilobytes of data\u2014a true technological feat. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ll immediately notice when we pick up an iPhone or Android phone. And in fact, that\u2019s entirely the point.", "description": "Forget Game of Thrones.
