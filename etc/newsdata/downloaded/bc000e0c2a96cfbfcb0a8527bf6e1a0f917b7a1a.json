It was like, oh my God, here we go. Saddle up, baby.\u201d\n\nWhile many of Ninja\u2019s fans showed overwhelming support, others remained skeptical, or simply wanted to know how much Ninja was paid to leave his high-profile status on Twitch for a growing community on a rival platform. Tyler is one of the world\u2019s most popular video-game players, and many people perceived this move as Ninja \u201cselling out.\u201d\n\nJessica says this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\n\u201cMoney was the last thing on our mind,\u201d she told Business Insider. \u201cIt\u2019s like, they don\u2019t even know what went on behind the scenes and how hard we tried to make that deal work \u2013 and then how amazing Microsoft was for us.\u201d\n\nThe value of Ninja\u2019s deal with Mixer is still kept heavily under wraps. But Jessica says money and finances were not the main drivers of the new deal.\n\nHow Ninja\u2019s Mixer move went down\n\nJessica, who has run and managed the rapidly growing Team Ninja enterprise for about three years now, said she and her husband spent \u201cmonths and months\u201d discussing their next big step \u2013 internally at home, and with Twitch \u2013 right after the couple\u2019s big New Year\u2019s Eve party in New York City, in early January.\n\nBut after many phone calls, with both Twitch and Team Ninja\u2019s agency and legal team, Jessica said it felt like Twitch \u201cdid not listen to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything we were asking, it never came back reflecting our wishes \u2013 and that\u2019s completely outside of finances,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for us, two people who were streaming on Twitch, it was really upsetting for us to go months and months and keep reiterating that we love you guys, we\u2019ve been here for a long time, but the things that are in the contract right now just don\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\ncaption Jessica Blevins and Tyler outside the Louvre, in Paris. source Cynthia Blevins\n\nOne of the main sticking points with Twitch\u2019s newly proposed contract was that it would limit Ninja\u2019s licensing deals, which Jessica and Tyler worked so hard to attain in the first place.\n\n\u201cWith the wording of how that contract was going, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to grow his brand much outside of gaming,\u201d Jessica told us. \u201cThere were already conflicts with his current sponsors and resigning with that platform. And we were like, \u2018Straight up guys, we\u2019ve worked so, so hard to grow the Ninja brand to license things and get his name out there. We can\u2019t go backwards with it.\u2019 So that\u2019s where that deal just really started not making sense.\u201d\n\nAnother major consideration for leaving, according to Jessica, was Tyler\u2019s happiness. She said the Ninja chatroom had become \u201cpretty toxic\u201d on Twitch, and Tyler expressed a desire to press the reset button on everything.\n\n\u201cI could tell as his wife, the last few months on Twitch, he just didn\u2019t seem like the Ninja that I knew,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem as enthusiastic, as loud, as hyped up about wins and motivated to stream. It really seemed like he was kind of losing himself and his love for streaming.\u201d\n\nAs negotiations with Twitch continued to drag on, Microsoft entered the picture.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft was so aligned with what we wanted and where we were at,\u201d she told us. \u201cMicrosoft backing us up and giving us support, it was such a warm, friendly environment. And when Tyler sat down, looked at the platform, and messed around with it, it was a quick decision. But it just felt like the right one to make.\u201d\n\nCompared to the months of talks with Twitch, Jessica said the Mixer deal happened very quickly \u2013 in a matter of weeks \u2013 because Microsoft was so accommodating, and really wanted to make Tyler\u2019s stream feel like a home again.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time we really felt like this is what\u2019s right for the brand,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cAnd this last month of him streaming on [Mixer], he\u2019s completely different. He\u2019s back to that energetic, pumped-up Ninja. I don\u2019t know if you can hear him screaming in the background right now because he\u2019s sniping people in \u2018Fortnite,\u2019 but like, and this is just his wife speaking, hearing that excitement and seeing him so happy, I\u2019m really, really happy we made it. It was a leap of faith and Microsoft\u2019s been nothing but amazing to us.\u201d\n\nWhen we reached out to Twitch, the company told us \u201cwe\u2019ve loved working with the Blevins family over the years, and we wish them the best.\u201d A Microsoft spokesperson said, \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Ninja and his community to Mixer. Mixer is a place that was formed around being positive and welcoming from day one, and we look forward to the energy Ninja and his community will bring.\u201d\n\nJessica said she and Tyler recently flew out to Seattle to meet with folks from Microsoft and Mixer, where Tyler got to see previews of games that won\u2019t be announced for another year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like little-kid excited again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t settle\u2019\n\nWhile the past year has been filled with award shows, trips around the world, making the TIME 100 list, and even an appearance on \u201cFamily Feud,\u201d Jessica says signing the Mixer deal \u201cwas the highlight for me of this year so far.\u201d\n\nBut Team Ninja is far from done.\n\n\u201cListen, we are not slowing down,\u201d Jessica told me. \u201cOne thing about Tyler and I, we don\u2019t settle.\u201d\n\nJessica says the plan is to continue \u201crolling out epic things\u201d and \u201cepic brand collabs.\u201d The day after my talk with Jessica, Adidas announced a major sneaker deal with Ninja \u2013 it was the company\u2019s first-ever brand deal with a pro gamer. She also mentioned cameos in movies and TV shows coming out soon, and the upcoming Super Bowl in February 2020: \u201cThose are things we\u2019re already talking about right now.\u201d\n\ncaption Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins appears on Fox\u2019s reality competition show, \u201cThe Masked Singer.\u201d source The Masked Singer/Fox\n\nBut Team Ninja has gotten more picky about choosing the right projects. Compared to past years, where Tyler and Jessica would jump at a chance at a TV spot, for instance, Jessica says they\u2019ve \u201creined back the excitement\u201d to ensure opportunities also align with the goals of Team Ninja: to do \u201cepic,\u201d fun projects, and reward the fans that contributed to Ninja\u2019s meteoric success.\n\n\u201cEverything still feels really new, and we don\u2019t know if his audience is going to love certain collaborations and ways that we\u2019re taking the brand. But we know that when we\u2019re doing these things, they\u2019re going to be done right,\u201d she said. \u201cThe community\u2019s really number one. We always want to make sure that the people who have us in this position in the first place \u2013 the fans \u2013 that they\u2019re happy and that they still feel part of Team Ninja.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - For more than a year, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins was synonymous with Twitch, Amazon's streaming service.
