Those books \u2014 which are supposed to be non-fiction \u2014 include \"Death by China\" and \"The Coming China Wars: Where They Will Be Fought and How They Can Be Won,\" according to the report.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment sent after office hours.\n\nNavarro, in a statement to the Chronicle, called Vara a \"whimsical device and pen name I've used throughout the years for opinions and purely entertainment value, not as a source of fact.\"\n\nHe said it's \"refreshing that somebody finally figured out an inside joke that has been hiding in plain sight for years.\"\n\nNavarro, a long-time China hawk, has a reputation for feeding Trump anti-China sentiment, according to The New York Times. He has publicly supported and defended Trump's tariffs on China, and been part of the U.S. delegation that negotiates trade matters with Chinese officials.\n\nRead the full report by The Chronicle of Higher Education.", "description": "Tessa Morris-Suzuki, a professor at the Australian National University, discovered that a character named Ron Vara in Navarro's books is fictional, reported The Chronicle of Higher Education newspaper.", "authors": ["Yen Nee Lee"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105468541-1537825325881gettyimages-929397338.jpeg?v=1571284962", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
