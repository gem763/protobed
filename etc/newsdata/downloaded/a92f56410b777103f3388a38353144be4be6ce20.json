According to the lawsuit, Oregon Health & Science University\u2019s fertility clinic also breached the promise that all of the children would be born to women living outside Oregon or on the East Coast.\n\nThe discovery prompted 53-year-old Bryce Cleary to claim $5.25 million in a lawsuit against the university clinic on Wednesday, according to the law firm that filed the complaint.\n\n\"OHSU treats any allegation of misconduct with the gravity it deserves,\" the clinic told FOX Business. \"In light of our patient privacy obligations and the confidentiality of protected health information, we cannot comment on this case.\"\n\nCleary made the donation 30 years ago shortly after becoming a first-year medical student at the university, according to the lawsuit. During his time as a student, Cleary and fellow male classmates were encouraged by employees of the university clinic to participate in a sperm donation and research program. He agreed to participate as long as his stipulations, including anonymity, were carried out.\n\nIn March 2018, Cleary started to learn that his sperm donations successfully resulted in the births of some children after two young women contacted him by using Ancestry.com data as well as some information provided by the clinic to identify more siblings and Cleary himself, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThis led to the discovery of at least 17 kids, who were conceived using his sperm and born in Oregon with the high possibility that some children had lived in the same town and attended some of the same schools as the children who were raised by he and his wife.\n\nThe stipulation of having the children born outside of the state was to lessen the chances that his various children might meet or become romantically involved, according to Cleary and his lawsuit.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCleary\u2019s suit was filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court by Best, attorney Daniel Gatti and attorney James Cleary who is one of the three sons raised by Bryce Cleary.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "A Oregon doctor who says his sperm was improperly used to father over a dozen children is suing the \u201cincredibly irresponsible\u201d clinic.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Bryce-Cleary-corvallis-clinic.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
