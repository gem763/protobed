We assume this renewed independent review will lead to a final end to all further speculation,\" Wulf Matthias, chairman of Wirecard AG's supervisory board, said in a statement.\n\nWirecard shares rose by 3.5 per cent in pre-market trading in Frankfurt.\n\nThe audit will begin immediately, Wirecard said, adding that KPMG would report to the company's supervisory board and have unrestricted access to information at all levels of the group.\n\nThomas Eichelmann, chairman of the audit committee of Wirecard's supervisory board and a former chief financial officer of Deutsche Boerse, will support the audit on behalf of Wirecard.\n\nWirecard has long been a favourite target of short sellers, or speculators who seek to profit from the airing of negative information that drives down a company's share price.\n\nIt has accused the FT and reporter McCrum of colluding with short sellers, as well as suing the newspaper. FT editor Lionel Barber has said an investigation by an outside law firm found no evidence to support those claims.\n\nIn-house auditor EY signed off on Wirecard's 2018 accounts in April after an earlier FT story alleged fraud and false accounting at the company's Singapore office.\n\nAn investigation by an outside law firm found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by head office, although Singapore staff may have broken local laws, Wirecard said at the time.\n\nSeparately, German prosecutors are investigating a group of individuals on suspicion of manipulating Wirecard stock, acting on evidence provided by financial market regulator Bafin.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [BERLIN] German payments company Wirecard has hired KPMG to conduct an independent audit to address allegations by the Financial Times (FT) that its finance team had sought to inflate reported sales and profits, it said on Monday. .
