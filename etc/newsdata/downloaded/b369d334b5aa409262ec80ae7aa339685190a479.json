Here are trends to look out for when searching for the perfect wedding venue, statement cake and crowd-pleasing entertainment\n\nStatement cakes\n\nHead-turning cakes are the in-thing this wedding season. According to Forever Bride, cakes with metallic touches, different textures like rippling icing and sugar flowers, as well as unexpected shapes and colours, are totally in! The site also encourages you to find a wedding cake baker on social media like Instagram. That way, you can see their work in pictures and also read posted reviews.\n\nHaving a band and a DJ\n\nIn the past, you had to pick either a live band or a DJ, but now you can have both! According to The Knot, having both the DJ and band can bring a bit of versatility to your wedding and appeal to all your guests\u2019 tastes. You can have the best of both worlds!\n\nNo-makeup make-up\n\nThe idea might freak you out at first, but according to The Knot, natural beauty is the way to go. You can have treatments leading up to the wedding day that will have you looking your best. \u201cMicroblading to perfect your brows and micro needling to boost bridal glow are among the most popular treatments.\u201d\n\nOut-of-the-box venues\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that our country has an abundance of wedding venues for just about any creed, religion or theme. Make sure the venue does not break the bank and most importantly, that it\u2019s different and unique. According to The Knot, breweries have replaced wineries as the trendiest wedding venues. \u201cTry to think of a venue that is out of the box and will work for you,\u201d reads the site.\n\nMake it personal\n\n\u201cThe new way to brand your wedding can\u2019t be seen, but it will be smelled,\u201d reads The Knot. Personalise your wedding in a way that everyone will never forget. \u201cCustom blends of perfumes and essential oils crafted especially for the occasion and are spritzed on invites, pumped through the venue, and even gifted in a form of a candle as a party favour can make your day unforgettable.\u201d", "description": "The wedding season is upon us!
