It sometimes sounds stupid, but there\u2019s something hidden under it that\u2019s very intelligent at the same time,\u201d he says.\n\nPolitical satire may be influencing Canadians in the same ways, too, particularly in these increasingly polarized times.\n\nCanada\u2019s Rhino party has unsuccessfully run candidates in federal elections off and on since 1963. In the party\u2019s heyday, Pierre Trudeau once called them \u201cthe court jesters of the nation\u201d \u2013 which the party took as a compliment.\n\nThe party has run on promises of repealing the law of gravity, reforming retail lottery laws by replacing cash prizes with senate seats and improving the economy by giving all Canadians a minimum of two jobs each.\n\nHow will Justin Trudeau's blackface photos affect Canada's election? Read more\n\nMeanwhile, the CBC\u2019s satirical news program This Hour Has 22 Minutes has been on air for 26 years and, more recently, Canadians have welcomed the acerbic wit of the Beaverton\u2019s news website and TV program.\n\nThere, Beaverton headlines poke at Canadians\u2019 political cynicism: \u201cTrudeau wondering how long until it\u2019s cool for him to do blackface again\u201d and \u201cPutin impressed Canadian voters don\u2019t need help spreading disinformation\u201d.\n\nCynicism isn\u2019t always a bad thing, says McClennen. In fact, it can rally people behind political issues. She points to protest signs, which today poke fun rather than make serious and direct calls for action.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some energy there, right?\u201d says McClennen. \u201cI\u2019m being critical of the system, but I\u2019m being sassy and sarcastic while I do it. And people are responding to that at a level that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d", "description": "Bernier faces competition from the Rhino party\u2019s candidate of the same name \u2013 but poking fun can make people more engaged", "authors": ["Tracey Lindeman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a3f551067811295dbcc23af3859426a48ee9bea/24_0_5164_3100/master/5164.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=43a3d1cb5ebc1d93e237edd0b4cb3aa0", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
