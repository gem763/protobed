A court document also says the case is related to the U.S. v Huawei case.\n\nA public defender, not a private attorney, had represented Mao when he gave up the right to challenge where he would be prosecuted.\n\nThe judge tried to make light of the situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d Donnelly told the Texas lawyer. \u201cWe\u2019re not that bad. Get to know us.\u201d\n\nShe set the next court date for Nov. 13.\n\nThe criminal case against Mao stems from an agreement he signed with San Jose, California-based CNEX Labs to use its circuit board for research.\n\nUnbeknownst to the tech company, Mao was also doing work for Huawei on an apparently similar product, according to a criminal complaint, which accuses Mao of secretly providing CNEX\u2019s proprietary information to Huawei in violation of the agreement.\n\nThe complaint describes but does not identify the Chinese telecommunications conglomerate or the tech startup.\n\nMao, 36, was released from jail in Texas after six days behind bars. He must stay his Texas home from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., confine his travel to Texas and New York, allow electronic monitoring, and not enter any Chinese diplomatic facilities. A $100,000 bond also was posted.", "description": "A lawyer for a Chinese professor accused of obtaining technology from a Silicon Valley startup to benefit China's Huawei on Wednesday told a federal judge that he would like to know why the case is in her Brooklyn courtroom.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
