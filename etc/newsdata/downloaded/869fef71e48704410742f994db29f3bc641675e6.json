Now imagine memorizing all of that 1,300 times. A Tokyo store clerk did just that and has been arrested for using the information to make personal purchases online.\n\nYusuke Taniguchi, 34-years-old, worked part-time as a cashier at a mall in Koto City, a special ward in Tokyo. According to Sora News 24, Taniguchi has a photographic memory, which helped him remember customers\u2019 information until he had time to write them down. After his arrest, the police reportedly found a notebook containing people\u2019s names and credit card details.\n\nTaniguchi was caught in March when he bought two bags valued at $2,500 that were delivered to his apartment. The police showed up with the delivery. The suspect told the police that he would sell the items he bought to a pawn shop and use the money for his expenses.\n\nAccording to All-Nippon News Network, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police are still investigating the case and looking into the extent of Taniguchi\u2019s crimes.\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "Tokyo police are now investigating a notebook where he recorded the credit card details.", "authors": ["Gavin Butler", "Caleb Quinley", "Sarah Ngu"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d761257e5959e000888f631/lede/1568020005968-rupixen-Q59HmzK38eQ-unsplash.jpeg?crop=0.9622xw:0.8111xh;0.0187xw,0.0625xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
