(AP Photo/Ron Edmonds)\n\nThe Investigations\n\nTHE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY'S RIGHT-WING MEDIA PROBLEM: Conservative media is working overtime to ensure that President Trump does not lose support from his base now that he's staring down the barrel of a formal impeachment inquiry. Trump's TV favorites \u2014 who also have a grip on the ears, eyes and hearts of his base \u2014 spent hours yesterday propagating conspiracy theories and baseless allegations. The goal was clear: Discredit the inquiry and the complaint from the whistleblower who accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine's government to investigate his political rivals.\n\nIn conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh's telling, Trump is being \u201cimpeached by the media\u201d via a whistleblower's complaint that was \u201cmanufactured\u201d by Democrats in a \u201ccoordinated coup attempt.\u201d His main argument: \u201cThe one thing that will get you through this, and the one thing that you have to understand, is practically everything in the media about impeachment is a lie.\u201d\n\nTrump is being \u201cimpeached by the media\u201d via a whistleblower's complaint that was \u201cmanufactured\u201d by Democrats in a \u201ccoordinated coup attempt.\u201d His main argument: \u201cThe one thing that will get you through this, and the one thing that you have to understand, is practically everything in the media about impeachment is a lie.\u201d Or ask Sean Hannity: The Fox News host dismissed any notion of impropriety or even poor judgment related to Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine's president at the very top of his show last night: \u201cThe president did not absolutely nothing wrong. Nothing.\u201d He rallied his viewers to support the president, calling it \u201can all hands-on deck moment \u2026 This is about our way of life.\u201d\n\nThe Fox News host dismissed any notion of impropriety or even poor judgment related to Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine's president at the very top of his show last night: \u201cThe president did not absolutely nothing wrong. Nothing.\u201d He rallied his viewers to support the president, calling it \u201can all hands-on deck moment \u2026 This is about our way of life.\u201d Hannity even went so far as to suggest that anyone questioning Trump\u2019s actions is borderline stupid: \u201cYou have to suspend every bit of God-given intelligence and common sense that you to believe that there is anything to this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to suspend every bit of God-given intelligence and common sense that you to believe that there is anything to this.\u201d Earlier in the day, Newt Gingrich \u2014 the former House speaker who led the impeachment of former president Bill Clinton \u2014 called the impeachment inquiry on Fox a \u201clegislative coup d'etat\u201d with the sole purpose of removing Trump from office. It was a refrain repeated by other conservative talkers.\n\nMore than just words: As Democrats investigate, Trump is busy lashing out at the whistleblower, musing that his impeachment could lead to an American civil war and questioning whether House Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), a leading voice in the impeachment inquiry, should be arrested for treason. These are the types of sentiments we heard frequently during our trip down the conservative media rabbit hole -- which offers a window into how his supporters' minds might not change even if Trump actually does get impeached by the House.\n\nA buffer: \u201cThe right-wing media provides a buffer for the Trump administration and his congressional supporters that makes accountability more difficult,\u201d Robert Faris, research director at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center who wrote a book about disinformation and radicalization in American politics, told Power Up. \u201cPartisan media is a narrative-generating machine that is armored against fact checking which explains a lot of where we are right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right-wing media provides a buffer for the Trump administration and his congressional supporters that makes accountability more difficult,\u201d Robert Faris, research director at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center who wrote a book about disinformation and radicalization in American politics, told Power Up. Conspiracies fly free: For right wing media, the real question is not whether Trump should be impeached \u2014 but why former vice president Joe Biden is not the focus of the investigation for his son's involvement in an obscure Ukrainian gas company. And Limbaugh floated multiple times various iterations of the baseless theory that the Obama administration somehow directed Ukraine to help Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nThe conservative media bubble is also putting intense pressure on the rest of the Republican Party.\n\nLimbaugh criticized Mitch McConnell for following the rule of law after the Senate Majority Leader confirmed that he would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to launch a trial if the House votes to impeach: \u201cThe Turtle said, 'Hey, if we do it, there\u2019s gotta be a trial.' There\u2019s nobody in official Republican strata that\u2019s trying to refute this! They\u2019re all dealing with it as though it\u2019s a fait accompli. It\u2019s not a fait accompli. But, see, there\u2019s a whole different mentality about this stuff when you live in the Beltway,\u201d Limbaugh shouted during his three hour radio show.\n\n\u201cThe Turtle said, 'Hey, if we do it, there\u2019s gotta be a trial.'

Reality check: McConnell tamped down on speculation he could simply ignore the prospect of putting Trump on trial, per our colleague Seung Min Kim. \u201cThe Senate impeachment rules are very clear,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe Senate would have to take up an impeachment resolution if it came over from the House.\u201d\n\nMcConnell tamped down on speculation he could simply ignore the prospect of putting Trump on trial, per our colleague Seung Min Kim. \u201cThe Senate impeachment rules are very clear,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe Senate would have to take up an impeachment resolution if it came over from the House.\u201d Limbaugh also criticized Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) for accepting \u201cthe impeachment business\u201d \u2014 even after Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) wrote a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr asking if the Justice Department was investigating an already debunked conspiracy theory that the Ukrainian government was coordinating with the Clinton campaign in 2016.\n\nPolitical ripple effects: \u201cI think [Republicans lawmakers] can't escape from Trump to some extent,\u201d said Geoff Kabaservice, the director of political studies at the Niskanen Center and author of a book on the downfall of moderation and the destruction of the Republican Party. \u201cWhen Trump says 'CrowdStrike has DNC servers,' the president's allies are obliged to feed that \u2014 and then the rest of the party is forced to act. To how seriously any of the senators involved actually believe in these things is unclear but this didn't seem to be something they were terribly upset about before.\u201d\n\nBut there was one key fact-checker yesterday \u2014 and from the government, no less. The intelligence community's own watchdog came out to debunk one allegation rampantly pushed by Trump, GOP allies, and right-wing media \u2014 the idea that the whistleblower is not legitimate because they lacked firsthand knowledge of the details outlined in his complaint.\n\nThe intelligence community's own watchdog came out to debunk one allegation rampantly pushed by Trump, GOP allies, and right-wing media \u2014 the idea that the whistleblower is not legitimate because they lacked firsthand knowledge of the details outlined in his complaint. The facts: \u201cBy law the Complainant \u2014 or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees \u2014 need not possess firsthand information in order to file a complaint \u2026\" the statement says.\n\nWhen, or will, Republicans break in their support?: \u201cThe question is whether people start to sacrifice their professional lives to tell a different story than the White House,\u201d Faris tells Power Up.\n\nKey: \u201cIt's difficult to see where minds are going to change from all of this,\u201d Faris told us. \u201cAny politician on the right who is going to go up against Trump and his narrative and the White house narrative will face the opposition of not only Trump and the White House but from the core of the conservative media \u2014 and they understand that very well.
