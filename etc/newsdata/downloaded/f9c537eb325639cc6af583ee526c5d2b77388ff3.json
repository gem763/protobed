Last year, the United Nations described climate change as \"the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific.\"\n\nAustralia is also being affected , with global warming killing coral on the Great Barrier Reef and contributing to fires, floods and droughts.\n\nYet, while a survey revealed that 64% of the Australian population believes climate change should be a top priority, the government has been slow to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Coal is Australia's second-largest export , according to Minerals Council of Australia, which represents the country's exploration, mining and minerals processing industry.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison speaks at Parliament House on July 1, 2019 in Canberra, Australia.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has long supported the coal industry. He famously brought a chunk of coal into Parliament in 2017, taunting the opposition party about its push for more renewable energy by saying : \"This is coal, don't be afraid, don't be scared, it won't hurt you.\"\n\nPacific Island countries, home to fewer than 10 million people, had this week hoped that Australia and New Zealand -- the richest and biggest emissions contributors of the 18 Pacific Island Forum members -- would step up their efforts to address the climate crisis by endorsing the so-called Tuvalu Declaration at the forum.\n\nHowever, Australia had reservations about the sections on emissions reductions, coal use and funding for the UN's Green Climate Fund, the ABC reported . New Zealand also expressed concern about the Green Climate Fund, it added.\n\nAs he left the meeting, Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said: \"We tried our best.\" Later, he recounted an exchange with Morrison during the talks, in which he told the Australian leade r: \"You are concerned about saving your economies ... I'm concerned about saving my people.\"\n\nSopoaga also described how, after a presentation earlier in the week, the Prime Minister of Tonga, Akilisi Pohiva, was brought to tears.\n\n#PIF2019: We came together in a nation that risks disappearing to the seas, but unfortunately, we settled for the status quo in our communique.

On Thursday, New Zealand also announced it would dedicate $150 million (US$97 million) to help with climate change resilience.\n\n\"We also did this because it is what's necessary to prevent our Pacific neighbors like Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands being put at significant risk of devastating impacts linked to climate change,\" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said . \"The catastrophic cost of doing nothing to tackle climate change is no longer an option.\"\n\nJonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an independent Australia-based think tank, said climate change is \"more than just a thought exercise for a country that most modeling shows will be uninhabitable within our lifetime.\"\n\nPryke added that Morrison had faced \"uncharacteristic hostility\" from Pacific nations during the \"bruising\" meeting, which wouldn't help Australia's relations across the region.", "description": "Australia has thwarted a push by Pacific Island nations for more action on the climate crisis in an emotional forum at which one leader broke down in tears.", "authors": ["Julia Hollingsworth"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190816004223-scott-morrison-file-super-tease.jpg"}
