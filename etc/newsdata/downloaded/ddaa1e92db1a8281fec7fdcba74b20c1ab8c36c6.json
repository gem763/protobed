The Badgers were the superior team on both sides of the ball and remained unbeaten with a 38-0 victory in front of an announced crowd of 80,470.\n\nThe shutout was the fourth this season for Wisconsin, which has outscored its opponents by a combined, 255-29, AND COUNTING.\n\nWisconsin wide receivers Quintez Cephus (87) and Kendric Pryor celebrate after a touchdown catch by Cephus during the first half against Michigan State at Camp Randall Stadium.

The Spartans (4-3, 2-2) played hard on defense but their offense was overmatched from start to finish.\n\nWisconsin rebounded from not scoring on its opening series with a pair of 75-yard touchdown drives and a 52-yard field-goal drive to build a 17-0 halftime lead.\n\nThat pushed its first-half scoring advantage this season to an incredible 152-3.\n\nQuarterback Jack Coan completed 3 of 3 passes for 47 yards on a 12-play, 75-yard drive in the opening quarter to help the Badgers take a 7-0 lead. He then hit Quintez Cephus for 19 yards to cap a five-play, 75 yard-drive for a 14-0 lead in the second quarter. Coan helped cap the first-half scoring by completing 5 of 6 passes for 32 yards, which led to Collin Larsh\u2019s 29-yard field goal with 4 minutes 30 seconds left in the half.\n\nThe first-half numbers were brutal for Michigan State fans and beautiful for Wisconsin fans.\n\nThe Badgers gained 198 yards compared to 38 for Michigan State; had 13 first downs to one for the Spartans; and held the ball for 23:26 compared to just 6:34 for the Spartans.\n\nTailback Jonathan Taylor had to fight on almost every play but capped Wisconsin\u2019s first scoring drive with a 1-yard run. He was held to 80 yards on 26 carries -- the first time he has failed to reach the 100-yard mark this season. Taylor needs 4 yards to hit the 5,000-yard career.\n\nCoan finished 18 of 21 for 180 yards, with one touchdown. His numbers through six games: 103 for 135 (76.3%) for 1,119 yards, with eight touchdowns and just one interception.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s offense sputtered a bit after halftime but a mammoth 15-play, 92-yard touchdown march helped push the lead to 24-0, Zack Baun\u2019s 24-yard interception return for a touchdown helped the Badgers push the lead to 31-0 and Kendric Pryor\u2019s 66-yard dash on a jet sweep left Michigan State staring at a 38-0 deficit with 10:52 left.\n\nGame over.\n\nBaun's touchdown was the fourth this season for the UW defense, which did not record a touchdown in 13 games last season.", "description": "Defense again led the way as No. 8 Wisconsin earned its fourth shutout of season in a dominant defeat of Michigan State.", "authors": ["Jeff Potrykus", "Published P.M.
