The UK Government, and the authorities in the City, may well have looked askance at the prospect of Chinese influence over the LSEG, given China's influence over HKEX, since the Hong Kong government appoints more than half of HKEX's board. The latest round of pro-democracy, pro-reform protests in Hong Kong raised the stakes even further.'\n\n'As a result, the LSEG share price never really got close to the offer price implied by HKEX's cash-and-shares proposal,' Mould continued. 'The plan of 2.495 HKEX shares plus \u00a320.45 in cash for every LSE share initially equated to a bid of \u00a383.61 a share.'", "description": "HKEX said it will not be making a firm offer after failing to win over the LSE board during initial talks.The decision to walk away comes less than a month after the surprise move.", "authors": ["Alex Sebastian For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
