Designed to boost U.S. commerce, the Stella was minted to match the \u201cLatin Monetary Union,\u201d a group of European nations that aimed to create easily exchangeable currencies.\n\nEXTREMELY RARE 1894 DIME ONCE OWNED BY JERRY BUSS SELLS FOR $1.3M\n\n\u201cDespite the interest in the coin, the denomination never received enough Congressional support to proceed with regular full-scale production,\u201d said Stack\u2019s Bowers Galleries, in a press release. \u201cThe denomination had no exact European counterpart due to the ratio of metals used not precisely matching LMU standards, was an unusual denomination, and seemed to have no real specific commercial use.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how many of the unusual 1879 coins were struck, with estimates ranging from 425 pieces to 800 coins.\n\n\u201cThe Stella represents an attempt to integrate the world\u2019s money as one,\u201d said Brian Kendrella, president of Stack\u2019s Bowers Galleries, in the press release. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t been able to do this even today but this coin represents the closest we likely ever came.\u201d\n\nSCHOOLKIDS DISCOVER 1,600-YEAR-OLD GOLD COIN\n\nThe coin will be auctioned at the Whitman Baltimore Winter Expo at the Baltimore Convention Center on Nov. 14.\n\nRare coins can command hefty sums. Other Stellas have been sold by Stack\u2019s Bowers Galleries for $400,00 and $646,000, respectively.\n\nAn 1894 dime, once owned by former Lakers owner Jerry Buss, was recently sold at auction for $1.32 million, including the buyer\u2019s commission. The 1894-S dime was one of only 24 minted, and only nine of the dimes are known to exist.\n\nIn 2016, an 1894-S dime sold for $2 million at a Florida auction.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.
