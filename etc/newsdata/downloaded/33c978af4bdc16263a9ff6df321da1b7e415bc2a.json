Why hasn't @RepAdamSchiff released the full transcript & why aren't so many in the media demanding it? Because it's FULL of inconvenient facts! pic.twitter.com/RFVqfaMOgD \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 8, 2019\n\nBack in DC for Amb Sondland\u2019s interview in AM as part of this partisan impeachment circus. Schiff\u2019s still holding these in secret w min transparency & cherry picked leaks. 4 days & he STILL hasn\u2019t released the Volker transcript. Why? Bc it\u2019s filled w too many inconvenient facts! \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 8, 2019\n\nHe also berated the press for failing to ask relevant questions and argued Americans are being \"screwed\" and \"held hostage\" by an engaged, far left base controlling the Democrat caucus.\n\nInstead of working together to pass USMCA, lower prescription drug prices & fight for the American people, House Dems continue to obsess over their partisan impeachment sideshow. We should be spending 100% of our time on the priorities most important to everyday Americans. \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 8, 2019\n\nThe American public is getting screwed by an enraged activist base trying to take down a sitting President. It's total gridlock in DC w/ House Dems eagerly ripping the country in 1/2 to appease people who want to resist, oppose, impeach & obstruct everything & anything. pic.twitter.com/XY8ZZ3Tfkh \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 8, 2019\n\nAs reported last week, Schiff is refusing to released the full testimony of former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. According to Republicans the testimony, which took place behind closed doors, shows President Trump never asked for an investigation into the Bidens in exchange for military aid. This is why:\n\nLast night House Intelligence Committee Democrats released a series of selective text messages from testimony given by former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. They make President Trump look very bad, even engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine. But they're hiding the context of the messages and the full picture by refusing to release Volker's full testimony. Republicans have repeatedly requested it be done and Chairman Adam Schiff is refusing to do so.\n\nVolker's opening statement, which was published, says the same.\n\n\"At no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden. As you will see from the extensive text messages I am providing, which convey a sense of real-time dialogue with several different actors, Vice President Biden was never a topic of discussion,\" Volker stated. \"Moreover, as I was aware of public accusations about the Vice President, several times I cautioned the Ukrainians to distinguish between highlighting their own efforts to fight corruption domestically, including investigating Ukrainian individuals (something we support as a matter of U.S. policy), and doing anything that could be seen as impacting U.S. elections (which is neither in the United States' nor Ukraine's own interests). To the best of my knowledge, no such actions by Ukraine were ever taken, at least in part, I believe because of the advice I gave them.\"", "description": ".10/08/2019 20:20:24PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/6a7d2689-a635-48fe-b48b-a7ac97b5f208.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
