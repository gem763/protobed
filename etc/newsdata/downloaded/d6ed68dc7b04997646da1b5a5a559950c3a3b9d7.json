He was found unresponsive and taken to hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time of his death \u2018no evidence of an assault or a restraint by a third party\u2019 was found in a post-mortem examination, and a report from the London Fire Brigade concluded that the fire was likely accidentally caused by an \u2018LED bulb falling onto bedding\u2019.\n\nPeter Fasoli\u2019s murdered evaded justice for two years after a coroner ruled he died accidentally (Picture: PA)\n\nAt the High Court in London on Tuesday, two senior judges quashed the coroner\u2019s original verdict of an accidental death and ordered that a new inquest must take place.\n\nDuring Marshall\u2019s trial at London\u2019s Old Bailey, jurors heard the killer stole nearly \u00a3800 from his victim before setting alight his bungalow to cover his tracks.\n\nHe went to Mr Fasoli\u2019s flat on the evening of January 6 2013 on the pretext of bondage sex, and dressed as a law enforcement agent complete with handcuffs, police utility belt, holster and latex gloves.\n\nHe \u2018arrested\u2019 Mr Fasoli \u2018for being a spy\u2019 and threatened to cut his tongue with a large hunting knife to extract his PIN numbers.\n\nHe then used his victims bank details to book a flight to Italy, where he killed a second man and attacked a third before finally being caught.\n\nThe trial judge at the Old Bailey said Marshall, who used gay dating app Badoo to stalk his victims, \u2018felt no remorse whatsoever\u2019 for the killing of Mr Fasoli.\n\nJudge Nicholas Hilliard QC also raised concerns that the police failed to detect the murder for nearly two years.\n\nJason Marshall inside Peter Fasoli\u2019s flat on the night he killed him (Picture: PA)\n\nThe judge said that social media records showed Marshall was coming to Mr Fasoli\u2019s home on the evening of the murder and that Mr Fasoli\u2019s bank card was used after his death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the wrongly recorded cause of death should be a lesson for authorities to look at whether procedures for investigations are sufficiently comprehensive and robust in such circumstances.\n\nAfter the trial, lawyers acting on behalf of the Senior Coroner for West London applied to quash the original verdict so a fresh inquest can be carried out.\n\nAt the high court today, Lord Justice Hickinbottom, sitting with Mrs Justice Lambert, said the case concerned \u2018quite extraordinary facts\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018In all the circumstances, it is clearly necessary and desirable in the interests of justice that a fresh inquest and investigation should take place\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
