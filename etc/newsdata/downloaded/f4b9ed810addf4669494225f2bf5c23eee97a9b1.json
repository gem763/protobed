The third section of the third article spells that treason against the United States \u201cshall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\u201d Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution, and the framers defined it narrowly. It consists only of waging war against the United State or adhering to enemies of the nation by giving them aid and comfort.\n\nThere are relatively few cases in which the federal courts have had the opportunity to explain the text of the Constitution in greater detail, though it has been a subject of commentary. The legal scholar George Fletcher, for example, has argued that the \u201cdistinguishing feature of treason in the Anglo American tradition\u201d is the \u201celement of breached loyalty.\u201d Indeed, the statutory requirements for treason in the criminal code presume the defendant owed \u201callegiance to the United States.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdhering to enemies of the nation suggests that the individual, to have engaged in treason, must identify with those enemies, to the extent that his or her heart does not lie with the United States. It is no simple matter to demonstrate such adherence. As the federal appellate judge Learned Hand famously observed in one of the few cases on the subject, actions innocent on their face will not necessarily support a charge of treason.\n\nConsider the conduct of Schiff that Trump believes is treasonous. The New York Times reported that the president maintains Schiff engaged in treason when he summarized what the president said to his Ukrainian counterpart during their phone conversation. Schiff characterized part of that conversation as something akin to what members of organized crime might say, essentially that in light of past favors from the United States, the president had implied that it was time for Ukraine to reciprocate.\n\nIt is not at all clear how the characterization of the conversation by Schiff could be regarded as treasonous. Schiff was not in any sense waging war against the nation. Neither did his characterization of the statements by Trump suggest that his allegiance does not lie, first and foremost, with the United States. The enemies of Trump might surely derive some aid and comfort from the remarks by Schiff, but the president is not the nation.\n\nEnglish law long ago had suggested that ill thoughts toward the monarch alone might qualify as treasonous. As Fletcher has explained, this version of treason \u201cfailed to find its way into the American Constitution,\u201d and for very good reason because the framers would never \u201cregard the president as the embodiment of the state or as the object of our allegiance.\u201d\n\nThe crime of treason embraced by the framers goes to the very core of the American experience. Having freed themselves from English rule, the colonies drifted under the Articles of Confederation but were united by the ratification of the Constitution. Unlike any founding document before, the Constitution made clear that, in the United States, the people are sovereign, not the federal government, or any one part of it, or any one person in it. Americans pledge allegiance to an ideal, not to a person. Nothing Schiff said at the hearing suggests a betrayal of this principle.\n\nIndeed, one might plausibly argue that Trump himself strayed closer to the line. Imagine credible allegations that the president was willing to consort with a foreign nation in pursuit of personal rather than national interests. While it does not rise to the level of treason, such conduct inches sufficiently close that it would have alarmed the framers. After all, they knew that while geography might protect the United States from foreign invaders, it would not insulate the young nation from corrupting influences. The danger is, as Alexander Hamilton had declared it, \u201cthe desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.\u201d\n\nLawrence Friedman is a professor at New England Law in Boston, where he teaches constitutional law.
