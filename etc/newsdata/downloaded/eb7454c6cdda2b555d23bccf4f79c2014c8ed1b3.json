Bush rode to a second term in 2004. Despite Iraq, and despite having the linguistic capability of a GCSE creative writing class, the 43rd president clung onto another four years. That's because, allegedly, he was the man most voters would prefer to have a beer with: 57 percent of them according to a Zogby/Williams poll in the autumn of that year. And though his time in the White House is up, Barack Obama is still dressing the part of post-office beer buddy, too.\n\n\n\nAt Munich's Bits & Pretzels Founders Festival, number 44 opened proceedings in a suit that wouldn't look out of place on the campaign trail. Comfortable yet slimline suit, a quietly classic watch and, of course, no tie. Nobody can enjoy an exchange with their CEO in the boardroom. But at the pub, sans neckwear, he's just like you and I! Who'd have thought it?!\n\nPhoto credit: Hannes Magerstaedt More\n\nOr at least that's the intention. When Obama (and indeed, the small army of 2020 candidates) gets stuck in with the normal folk, it's sleeves up, tie off, smiles on. Normality is a much-valued commodity. When in such situations, the former president dresses like a natural in Normal Mode.\n\nIt serves as a stark contrast to Donald Trump. Whether in the White House, or headlining a rally in Wyoming, the current president rarely loses the billowing power suit. Trump never relaxes the code for one-on-one mode; the CEO is never dressed for Friday beers. Instead, 45 is usually stood aloft a crowd, businessman garb in full gear, the Eighties management hierarchy firmly in place.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: SOPA Images More\n\nGranted, that's part of Trump's brand: run America like one of his businesses. And, like many of them, expect the USA to file for financial (and moral) bankruptcy right about now. But when it comes to the classic battle armour of presidents that aren't underwater in approval ratings, Obama is still getting the rounds in.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "44's wardrobe passes the litmus test for a third term", "authors": ["Murray Clark"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/THpWwFjDaF08IpLFfPr6tg--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/esquire_253/ca0b7ad41c8cb550cb873e45afc2132f", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
