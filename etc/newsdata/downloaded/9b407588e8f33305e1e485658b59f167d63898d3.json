Their close relationship with repressive governments and regimes such as Egypt, Mexico and Russia has led to horrendous human rights violations.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption (L-R) Tim Minchin, Harriet Walter, David Tennant, Dame Judi Dench, Paapa Essiedu and Benedict Cumberbatch performed at the RSC's Shakespeare Live! in 2016\n\n\"It is sickening that the works of Shakespeare are being associated with these events.\"\n\nThe letter concludes: \"BP's influence is nothing but a stain on the RSC.\"\n\nCatherine Mallyon, RSC executive director and Gregory Doran, RSC artistic director said: \"We welcome the conversation around this issue and will respond once we receive the letter.\n\n'Displeasure'\n\n\"We recognise the importance for a continuing, robust and engaged debate, we acknowledge the climate emergency and recognise the strength of feeling, especially amongst our young people.\n\n\"Our work with over 500,000 students annually means their feedback and opinions are very important to us.\"\n\nMore than 60,000 people signed a recent petition for cultural institutions - the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and Royal Opera House - to end their financial ties with the BP, and climate activists To BP Or Not BP have campaigned against fossil fuel funding going into the arts.\n\n\"As a pupil of the school that Shakespeare attended himself, I cannot begin to explain my displeasure in learning about BP's recent sponsorship of the RSC's 16-25 tickets,\" said 16-year-old Stratford-upon-Avon student Chloe Hawryluk.\n\n\"If I want to attend the theatre, I want to attend the theatre without supporting a company that is continuing to extract fossil fuels.\"\n\nShe added: \"I don't want to support a company that is one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, I don't want to support a company that is only doing this to distract us from the fact that they are ruining our planet.\"\n\n'Reducing emissions'\n\nIn response BP said they have been supporting the arts in the UK for more than 50 years and that their support allows the institutions they partner \"to widen access and extend the reach of their productions and exhibitions\".\n\nThey stressed their working relationship with the RSC dates back to 2011 and claim \"to have helped around 10,000 young people benefit from reduced-price access to its world-class productions\".\n\n\"Our position on climate is clear - the world is on an unsustainable path and needs to move to net-zero carbon emissions in the decades to come,\" said a spokesperson.\n\n\"We are reducing emissions in our operations, improving our products to allow customers to reduce their emissions and investing to grow low carbon.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
