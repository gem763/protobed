However, the Ombudsman found 100 notices.\n\n\"While this practice is not strictly in breach of any legislative provision, in our view it has a similar effect to giving an ongoing preservation notice,\" the report said.\n\n\"Home Affairs is not authorised to give ongoing notices because it is not an interception agency.\"\n\nIn the prior installment of the report released in 2017, which covered the 2015-16 financial year, Australian Customs was handed the only three recommendations contained within the report.\n\n\"In our view, Customs does not have sufficient processes in place to demonstrate that it is only dealing with lawfully accessed stored communications,\" the report said.\n\nOn the recommendations made previously, the Ombudsman said his office would continue to monitor Home Affairs' continuing remedial action.\n\nAn area the Ombudsman identified as getting worse was in complying with destruction of stored communications requirements.\n\nFrom 26 instances last year, the figure jumped to 134 instances in 2017-18.\n\nState agencies were particularly to blame, with the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission having 10 instances, Queensland Police with 18, Northern Territory Police had 23 instances, and Western Australia Police had 19.\n\nTasmania Police was a runaway infringer, with a final figure of 53 instances.\n\nThe Ombudsman also pointed out a number of agencies had accessed telco data outside of the TIA Act by using other legislated powers.\n\n\"Our Office is not aware of any statutory external oversight of any disclosure of telecommunications data that may occur outside an authorisation made under the TIA Act,\" the Ombudsman said.\n\nWhile the Commonwealth Ombudsman could use his own powers to inspect federal agencies, the report said, oversight would still be lacking for state agencies.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton recently appeared in a video labelled as \"the baddest MP\".\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nHome Affairs floats making telcos retain MAC addresses and port numbers\n\nSoon it might just be easier for Australia's telcos to keep a copy of every TCP or UDP header for the cops to poke through.\n\nEmployees not the target of encryption laws: Home Affairs\n\nAustralian developers really do need to relax. Cops and spooks are being told very clearly that the Assistance and Access Act isn't for dragooning you into deceiving your bosses.\n\nHome Affairs says no problems with encryption laws even though local companies suffer\n\nThe department said it is however 'focused' on addressing the negative perception of Australia's encryption laws, saying companies actually lack a clear understanding of the obligations within legislation.\n\nCanberra to establish content blocking regime for crisis events\n\neSafety Commissioner to decide what Australians shouldn't see.\n\nAustralian Taxation Office really wants its access to telco metadata returned\n\nATO claims a lack of access to retained metadata of Australians has impacted its criminal cases to the tune of an average AU$10,770 per investigation.\n\nAustralia is getting a new cybersecurity strategy\n\nFeedback from consultation will be used to form a superseding document to the 2016 Cyber Security Strategy.", "description": "Australian cops have a problem with timely destroying stored communications.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/09/20/813f3fab-1a09-45cd-bae0-0ea4add20933/thumbnail/770x578/1684b9ece946ec9b974cac08576ad159/dutton.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
