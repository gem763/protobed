As if to underscore Moscow\u2019s importance, Russian troops launched patrols over the past two days on the outskirts of Manbij, one of the most contested towns under U.S. control.\n\nOn Tuesday, just as U.S. national security adviser John Bolton was leaving Ankara after Erdogan declined to meet him, Russian and Kurdish websites posted videos of Russian military vehicles rumbling through the Syrian countryside trailing big Russian flags. The videos mirrored similar images of U.S. military patrols when they began nearly two years ago.\n\nThe Russian patrols took place in an area around the town of Arima, which is already controlled by the Syrian regime, and don\u2019t pose any challenge to the U.S. troops located several miles away.\n\nBut Aaron Stein, director of Middle East programs at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute, said the patrols served as a reminder that with U.S. policy in disarray and U.S. troops on the way out, \u201cRussia owns all of this now.\u201d\n\nRussia has so far not committed to helping either Turkey or the Kurds. After Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, told reporters that Erdogan was scheduling a visit to Moscow this month, the Kremlin said plans are in the works but cautioned that no date has been set.\n\nThe Russians have also made no commitments to the Kurds to support their quest for a deal that would bring Syrian government troops back into the area to deter a Turkish invasion, said Saleh Muslim, a senior official with the main Kurdish political party, the Democratic Union Party (PYD).\n\nThe Kurds have submitted a proposal to Moscow that would allow the Syrian government to restore its overall sovereignty over the vast area of Syria taken over by the Kurds since 2012, first during the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule and then in the war against the Islamic State. In return, the Kurds want the Syrian government to grant them a degree of autonomy, allowing them to continue their experiment in self-governance, Muslim said.\n\n\u201cWe have given our road map to the Russians. We are just waiting on a decision,\u201d he said.\n\nAmid conflicting messages from members of the Trump administration about how the troop withdrawal will occur, it seems increasingly clear that Russia, as the only power talking to all the players, is best positioned to mediate a solution, Stein said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is coming out, and the other countries are moving in to fill the vacuum, and they\u2019re all talking. They\u2019re just not talking to the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after a visit to the Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil on Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stressed that U.S. troops will withdraw after the Islamic State\u2019s last pocket of territory has been defeated.\n\nPompeo\u2019s comments seemed to contradict statements by Bolton earlier this week. Bolton said the United States would not pull troops out of Syria without first receiving guarantees from Turkey that it would refrain from attacking the Kurds \u2014 which drew a sharp rebuke from Erdogan \u2014 and assurances that Iran would not fill the vacuum.\n\nPompeo appeared to acknowledge that Turkey has concerns about the Kurds possibly using the territory they control to launch attacks against Turkey after the U.S. forces are gone.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledged that there is a threat to Turkey from terrorists, and we will be very supportive,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump apparently promised Erdogan in a telephone call last month that the United States would turn over the war against terrorism in the area to Turkey, according to accounts by U.S. officials.\n\nBut Turkey regards the main Kurdish militia, the People\u2019s Protection Units, as a terrorist group on a par with the Islamic State because of the militia\u2019s affiliation with Kurdish militants fighting for autonomy inside Turkey.\n\n\u201cThey are all the same to us,\u201d Cavusoglu told reporters on Wednesday, referring to the Islamic State and the Kurdish groups fighting both in Syria and Turkey.\n\nTurkey is also reaching out to Iran to discuss the aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal, Cavusoglu added. \u201cWhether you like it or not, Iran is an actor in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, we need to work in a constructive manner with the present actors.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTurkish rebuke of Bolton highlights troubled effort to sell U.S. plan for exit from Syria\n\nTurkey threatens to \u2018bury\u2019 Kurdish forces in Syria amid U.S. withdrawal\n\nIn the Middle East, Russia is back\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Amid conflicting signals from the Trump administration over how and when U.S. troops will leave, all sides are hoping Russia will come up with a solution.", "authors": ["Liz Sly", "Beirut Bureau Chief", "Covering Lebanon", "Syria", "The Wider Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xcfcjAYP6zl15qNOvq1_de7Iq3w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W7LMZOQUNAI6TNVNTT6WFW5QVA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-09"}
