The incoherent jumble of Trump\u2019s own mind, backed now with the enormous power of the American presidency, has the capacity to create a real world that doesn\u2019t hang together. When we each try to explain it to ourselves and others, we naturally incline to fill in blanks and sketch connections that might make it all cohere, and so we end up painting perverse conspiracies, most of which are surely false. We can already see that happening in this case, as we all try to reason our way through an avalanche of unfamiliar figures and preposterous events and end up acting like we\u2019ve always had strong views about how many people listen to presidential phone calls and the relative merits of different Ukrainian state prosecutors.\n\nMany conversations with people who have spent a lot of time with Trump these last few years have left me thinking that Trump\u2019s world is probably less perverted than either his detractors or his champions end up suggesting, because it\u2019s less cogent. Why did one thing follow another? The answer is probably just not as lucid as you or I will tend to expect. That doesn\u2019t mean Trump doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, or that he\u2019s not basically a narcissistic thug. It just means that what he knows himself to be doing probably isn\u2019t what people who follow politics think it would be.", "description": "", "authors": ["Yuval Levin", "Nationalreview.Com Corner The-Impeachment-Train"], "top_image": ""}
