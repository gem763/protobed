I think that kind of lets you know how fresh of a start it really is.\u201d\n\nThere was no mention of their departed All-Stars, outside of Enes Kanter referring to Kyrie Irving as \u201ca guy who shall not be named\u201d and Daniel Theis describing how the Celtics plan to run more, leveraging their frontcourt athleticism now that Al Horford\u2019s playmaking as a point center in the half-court is no longer an option.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nUnlike last season, there were no declarations that Boston can beat anyone in a seven-game series. Even Jayson Tatum dialed back his prediction earlier this summer of 20 points per game, an All-Star appearance and a spot in the Finals.\n\n\u201cI always have expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re different than they were last year, but I think I\u2019m going to keep them to myself this year. I\u2019m going to keep them in my mind, but winning is the most important. That\u2019s always the goal.\u201d\n\nInstead, those in attendance had to read between the lines. Was \u201cfresh start\u201d code for a sigh of relief that Irving was gone? If inclined, you could certainly read it that way when you listen to Smart\u2019s answer to a question about Kemba Walker recognizing that leadership must be earned.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhen you have a competitor and a guy like that who is willing to come in here and know that and not just come in here and think that because he was an All-Star and everything like that,\u201d said Smart, \u201cthat just helps these younger guys, myself included, because we see that and it makes us want to go out there and give everything we have for him.\u201d\n\nSemi Ojeleye described the atmosphere around this year\u2019s team as \u201ca lot lighter,\u201d and Celtics staffers at the event acknowledged that there was a cloud around last year\u2019s group that seems to have been lifted by the new personnel, especially the handful of rookies who have practically been inseparable since arriving in June.\n\nJaylen Brown arrived at media day with a fresh haircut. (Getty Images)\n\nKanter, who lightened the mood by handing out cookies to assembled media prior to his interview, has helped, too.\n\n\u201cEnes is the type of person I always want to be around because he just has such a positive aura around him,\u201d said Tacko Fall, \u201cand he is such a great person with the biggest heart.\u201d\n\nThere was no finger-pointing. If anything, staffers who bit their tongues throughout a tumultuous 2018-19 campaign conceded that the handful of returning players took to heart their responsibility for last season\u2019s failures. Gordon Hayward said as much.\n\n\u201cYou learn that nothing is going to be given to you in this league,\u201d said Hayward. \u201cA lot of people kind of just handed us the trip to the Finals and thought we were going to walk our way to the Eastern Conference finals. That\u2019s obviously not the case and didn\u2019t happen. There\u2019s a lot more to basketball than just looking at who\u2019s on the team. Some of the intangible things we didn\u2019t do as good of a job last year, but I think individually each one of us had a lot to think about this summer and a lot to learn about what we can all do better. I certainly used that as motivation for myself to be a lot better player during this offseason, making sure I was getting my work in, but I think we\u2019re all looking forward to this season and that fresh-start feel.\u201d\n\nHayward was among those who stayed in Boston this summer in an attempt to build chemistry with the new group. Outside of the four members of Team USA \u2014 Walker, Tatum, Smart and Brown, who had their own offseason of bonding \u2014 almost everyone spent considerable time this offseason working at the team\u2019s new practice facility to ensure that those intangibles do not slip through the cracks this year, even on paper if the roster is not as talented as last year\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAll the guys are good guys, man,\u201d said second-round pick Carsen Edwards. \u201cJust being here over the summer and just being a new guy in a gym full of new guys, but also having guys who have been in the league here for years as well, I feel like for me it\u2019s really cool to see that they\u2019re here and it\u2019s just as important for them to be here during the [preseason] when they could be working out wherever they wanted to.\u201d\n\nThere were many introductions of new faces and a handful of bookkeeping items to cover. Hayward feels better, both mentally and physically. Tatum\u2019s ankle and lottery pick Romeo Langford\u2019s thumb will not restrict them in training camp. Coach Brad Stevens wants to play faster with, as Ojeleye put it, \u201ca bunch of wings and a five man.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and Kanter\u2019s shot at the New York Knicks, the fresh-start Celtics spent their media day doing everything they could to reverse course from last season, setting low expectations in hopes of overachieving.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nBen Rohrbach is a staff writer for Yahoo Sports.
