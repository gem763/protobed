Mr Bray said: 'My heart was in my mouth, it's absolutely life or death for the wildebeest, and pretty dramatic to witness'\n\n'The crocodile was not really trying hard enough, as it'd already eaten plenty of wildebeest and was full.\n\n'My heart was in my mouth, it's absolutely life or death for the wildebeest, and pretty dramatic to witness.\n\n'I was totally hoping the wildebeest would escape as I've seen way too many eaten.\n\n'Filming as steadily as I could in super slow-motion I knew this was going to be awesome footage as the scene unfolded in front of me, and I was pretty excited to play it back after to check it worked! It did!'", "description": "Wildlife photographer Chris Bray, 36, was in Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
