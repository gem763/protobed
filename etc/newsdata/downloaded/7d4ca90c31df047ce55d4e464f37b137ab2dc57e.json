The bridge cost 1.8 trillion rupiah ($128 million) to build, according to news portal CNN Indonesia.\n\nWidodo has also promised 139 km of roads and a new airport in the Arfak highlands to help locals transport agricultural products to the Papuan city of Manokwari, his office said.\n\nThe killings of 16 construction workers building the Trans Papua highway, Widodo's flagship project in the region, by separatist rebels last year has focused new attention on who will benefit from the new infrastructure in the region.\n\nIn the latest unrest in the area, Indonesian security forces said three motorbike taxi drivers were shot dead on Friday by separatists in Hitadipa, some 340 km away from Jayapura. The military wing of the Free Papua Movement, a separatist group, claimed responsibility, but said the victims were Indonesian military personnel.\n\nResource-rich Papua, which shares the island of New Guinea with the nation of Papua New Guinea, has a distinct Melanesian population and was a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a controversial U.N.-backed referendum in 1969.
