Vindman, the top White House expert on Ukraine, who will testify to the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday about his concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July.\n\nThe statement, leaked to the Times \u2014 though committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has likened impeachment to a \u201cgrand jury\u201d proceeding, which is typically conducted in secrecy \u2014 is described by the Times as the first account of someone who actually listened in on the telephone call, as opposed to hearing about it second- or third-hand.\n\nIn his statement, Vindman \u2014 a Ukrainian-American and decorated Army officer who was awarded the Purple Heart after being wounded by a roadside bomb in Iraq \u2014 outlines his own views on \u201cThe Geopolitical Importance of Ukraine.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe U.S. government policy community\u2019 s view is that the election of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the promise of reforms to eliminate corruption will lock in Ukraine\u2019 s Western-leaning trajectory.\u201d\n\nVindman says that he became concerned in the spring of 2019 about \u201coutside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency.\u201d\n\nThat concern for the fate of the \u201cconsensus views of the interagency\u201d informed Vindman\u2019s approach to the president\u2019s contacts with Zelensky.\n\nHe was pleased with Trump\u2019s first congratulatory call to Zelensky in April 2019, but became alarmed in early July when the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, \u201cstarted to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure [a] meeting with the President.\u201d Vindman does not identify those investigations.\n\nLater, during a debriefing with American officials, Sondland \u201cemphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election , the Bidens, and Burisma,\u201d Vindman recalls. That is when Vindman pushed back, saying Sondland\u2019s statements were \u201cinappropriate\u201d and the National Security Council would not be involved.\n\nOn July 25, when the president called Zelensky to congratulate him on his party\u2019s parliamentary victory, Vindman listened in on the call. He says: \u201cI was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019 s support of Ukraine.\u201d Notably, the transcript of the call suggests that Trump did not \u201cdemand\u201d an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nVindman goes on to say that he concluded that if Ukraine was seen as a partisan player in U.S. politics, that could undermine \u201cbipartisan support\u201d for better relations with Ukraine. \u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security,\u201d Vindman argues, substituting his views \u2014 or those of the \u201cinteragency\u201d \u2014 for those of the president himself.\n\nVindman says that he reported his concerns to the National Security Council\u2019s lead counsel. He denies being the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d or knowing the identity of the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d or wishing to speculate about such. He concludes with another policy view: \u201cThe United States and Ukraine are and must remain strategic partners.\u201d\n\nAt no point does Vindman accuse the president of breaking the law, but of doing what he thought \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe public will not see Vindman face questions from the committee, because it is being held behind closed doors and \u201cin defiance of a White House edict not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry,\u201d the Times reports, though it does not explain that the reason for the White House stance is that the House has not yet authorized the inquiry.\n\nOnly one copy of the transcript of Vindman\u2019s testimony will be provided to Republican members of the committee, who will only be allowed to review the transcript with a Democratic staffer present to observe them at all times.\n\nJoel B.
