The record labels have been hit financially by the disruption caused by the Internet, and they continue to lobby Congress to require local radio stations to bail them out.\n\nTo date, Congress has shown no appetite to give into the pandering of the big label conglomerates. However, that has not stopped the music bigwigs, including inexplicably the music publishers. During an event at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School, they recently pressed Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, New York Democrat, to push this divisive issue through Congress.\n\nThere, Mr. Nadler stated that, in the post-Music Modernization Act world, there is still unfinished business to take care of with music licensing. In particular, he singled out the need to implement a performance royalty for AM/FM radio airplay as the next step forward. The trouble is that for years, most of his colleagues in Congress have disagreed, claiming that such a new fee structure would be devastating to the music industry at large.\n\nFor the past several Congresses, the House of Representatives has routinely issued a resolution opposing such a radio royalty. In fact, in recent years, a strong bipartisan majority of the House has opposed a new royalty on radio.\n\nThe Senate concurs with the House\u2019s opinion on this matter. Years ago, it issued a report stating that Congress \u201cshould do nothing to change or jeopardize the mutually beneficial economic relationship between the recording and traditional broadcasting industries.\u201d It made this statement under the belief that imposing a fee on the free airplay radio stations provide to the recording industry would be unfair to stations and performers alike.\n\nIt is quite ironic that the music industry fat cats are pushing for this new tax when they already profit greatly from radio\u2019s free promotional exposure. Without radio airplay, they would have little means of free mass promotion, which would harm their artists\u2019 ability to maximize their earning potential. Additionally, with this added cost, radio would have no choice but to resort to playing established artists almost exclusively. As a result, all-too-many up-and-comers would lose their shot at making it within the industry.\n\nCongress has understood the counterproductivity of such a proposal for decades. Which raises the question: Why would Mr. Nadler or any other member of Congress try to break up this vast realm of agreement and turn it into yet another political battleground?\n\nBased on his statements made at the Steinhardt event, Mr. Nadler seems to be under the illusion that the radio industry, rather than the music industry brass, is the crony interest in this fight. When considering who hosted Mr. Nadler for the event, it becomes more understandable why he would think so. After all, the Steinhardt School at NYU has become an advocacy platform for music industry interests.\n\nThe program\u2019s leadership team has a history of working for the \u201chave your cake and eat it too\u201d interests. Larry Miller, the director of Steinhardt, served as a paid witness for the music publishers just three years ago. Given his allegiances, it\u2019s no wonder why Mr. Miller routinely derides the radio industry to the press, as he did in a CNBC article this summer, which I refuted. There is clearly an anti-radio bias within NYU\u2019s music school, and policymakers should not take the bait \u2014 at least not without the proverbial \u201cgrain of salt.\u201d\n\nBy all accounts, the Music Modernization Act reformed vast swaths of the once-antiquated music licensing industry. Its alterations included updating music royalty rules with the streaming age and ensuring that songs dated before 1972 receive copyright treatment for the first time.\n\nWithout question, Congress had artists\u2019 interest at heart when crafting this bill. But the reason members chose not to include a radio performance royalty was done with performers\u2019 well-being in mind as well. Congress knew that such a change would only serve to benefit the well-to-do at the expense of everyone else.\n\nRather than continuing to spout the music elite\u2019s talking points while taking direction from academics that seemingly have much more than an intellectual interest in the industry, Congress should focus its attention on reforms that can achieve agreement.\n\nCongress is already divided like never before, and it\u2019s high time for everyone to sing from the same song sheet.\n\n\u2022 Andrew Langer, president of the Institute for Liberty, is the host of \u201cThe Andrew Langer Show\u201d on WBAL NewsRadio 1090 in Baltimore.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
