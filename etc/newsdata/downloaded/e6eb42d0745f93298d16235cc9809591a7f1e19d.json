I\u2019ve had it on my legs, my scalp, and on my arms, but I get it with the most frequency and intensity on my hands, which are, of course, the most inconvenient place to have a painful sensitivity to touch! (You try rummaging through your wallet for your Oyster card when your hands are on fire.) When I\u2019m at my worst, I use a prescribed steroid cream, but I avoid it when outbreaks are milder because it\u2019s greasy, smelly, and ends with me leaving icky fingerprints on my keyboard, the fridge handle, the doorknob, my clothes, you name it. So when the steroid isn\u2019t absolutely necessary, my hero is the Naked Bee\u2019s Hand & Cuticle Healing Salve.\n\nFunnily enough, I was first given a pot of this by a doctor! Full disclosure: That doctor was my sister-in-law (shout-out to Marie!), and the salve was offered as a nice, pampering souvenir from her trip to Colorado and not in any way, shape, or form as a prescription for helping out with my eczema problem \u2014 I\u2019m not even sure Marie knew I had eczema at that point. But help it did.\n\nThe Naked Bee Hand & Cuticle Healing Salve All natural and made from beeswax, as you could probably guess, it\u2019s also got sunflower oil and shea butter. It comes in a pocket-friendly metal tin, and I\u2019ve found it the perfect solution for my flayed hands. \u00a312 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nI use it most days, in the morning and before bed. When eczema rears its angry red head, I apply it a bit more liberally and at concentrated spots. A few weeks ago, I had a really funny, small breakout (one fingertip, almost below the nail; how annoying is that?) and it was driving me crazy \u2014 to the point where if it spread, I was definitely going to have to pop to the pharmacy for the greasy muck that is my steroid cream. But some extra care with the Naked Bee helped keep it in check, giving me a nice little layer of protection that absorbed into the skin over time. Now that it\u2019s healing, I just rub the salve into my hands as usual, and the skin is re-softening over time.\n\nThat pot that Marie gave me two Christmases ago is still going strong, even though I go through periods of using it several times a day. But when I am ready for a refill, I won\u2019t have to trek to Colorado to get it, thank God \u2014 it\u2019s online, and trust me when I say I\u2019m going to stock up. For \u00a312.39, it\u2019s value for money \u2014 the rare beauty product that literally does what it says on the tin.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
