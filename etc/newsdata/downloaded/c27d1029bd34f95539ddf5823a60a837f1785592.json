Their sacrifice and courageous stand addressed the two-tier wages structure and permanent temporary worker classification that has plagued working class Americans.\u201d\n\nIn announcing the ratification and end to the strike, UAW said 23,389 members voted yes and 17,501 voted no on the proposed contract.\n\nThe UAW said that workers will begin to report to work as instructed by GM. The union also announced Friday the next pattern bargaining company will be Ford.\n\nGM confirmed the contract ratification saying it delivered a contract that recognizes employees for the important contributions they make to the company's success with a strong wage and benefit package and additional investment and job growth in U.S. operations.\n\n\"GM is proud to provide good-paying jobs to tens of thousands of employees in America and to grow our substantial investment in the U.S,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said. \" As one team, we can move forward and stay focused on our priorities of safety and building high-quality cars, trucks and crossovers for our customers.\"\n\nUAW Local 598 members go in to cast their ratification vote in the UAW and General Motors national agreement at the Union City Fields in Flint on Wednesday, October 23, 2019.

Temporary workers are to get $4,500.\n\nGM will notify union workers through the normal channels on when they should return to work, which is certain to be as quickly as possible. The strike cost the company $450 million a week, the Center for Automotive Research estimated, interrupted production of key vehicles and will delay delivery of the 2020 midengine Corvette Stingray.\n\nThe strike's impact goes beyond the automaker.\n\nLear Corp. said Friday that the six-week strike represents $525 million in lost revenue for the seating and electronic systems supplier.\n\nLear, based in Southfield, also lowered its full-year financial outlook, according to Crain\u2019s Detroit Business. Its third-quarter net income fell 15% to $216 million. GM is Lear's largest customer, accounting for 18 percent of Lear\u2019s business last year.\n\nTemporary workers\n\nThe union said the new contract will automatically make more than 900 temporary workers regular employees in January. After that, temps would get permanent jobs as they accrue time on the job under terms of the new contract. Their benefits improve, and the union has a voice in how many temporary workers the company can add.\n\nLikewise, all \"in-progression\" workers would get a raise within 52 weeks of their last raise. Under the old contract, those hired after 2007, dubbed in-progression workers, start at $17 an hour and can move up to $28 an hour after eight years. This new deal provides for them to reach $32.32 an hour by the time the new contract expires in 2023.\n\nAt Local 163, which represents GM Romulus Powertrain, 1,064 members out of about 1,100 voted, said Ralph Morris, president of the local. He said many workers live as far away as Flint and Toledo, but they drove in to vote.\n\nBut during the informational meetings, there were many \u201cimpassioned\u201d questions around the contract, he said.\n\n\u201cSome liked that there were no increases to their health care, they liked that the cap was raised for wages to help in-progression employees move up,\u201d said Morris. \u201cBut, it was a mixed bag. Was it a slam dunk? No, but a lot of them felt it was an improvement from the current plan and there was a pathway for temporary employees.\u201d\n\nGM will be calling some Local 163 skilled trades workers asking them to work Saturday and Sunday, said Morris. They will be paid time-and-a-half for that work. Monday would be the full production day, he said.\n\nNext up for UAW\n\nThe UAW will move on to negotiating a new tentative agreement with Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, using the GM contract as the template.\n\nA UAW local leader at a General Motors plant said the union will face challenges at Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles as they head into negotiations with those companies.\n\n\u201cFord really wanted the health care cut down and Chrysler has the biggest problem with four levels of 10,000 temp workers. Chrysler is going to be very challenging,\u201d the local officer said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what Chrysler will do with 10,000 temp employees.\u201d\n\nFlint Assembly electrician Mike Thomas sits outside of General Motors Flint Assembly while on strike on Wednesday, October 16, 2019. (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press)\n\nThis officer said Ford should have the easiest time because the union\u2019s top negotiator for Ford, Rory Gamble, has a lot of experience and a good relationship with Ford\u2019s negotiations team.\n\n\u201cThey have a strong ability to work together, so they shouldn\u2019t have any problems at all,\u201d said the GM local leader.\n\nIndeed, what worked for GM and the UAW in negotiations isn't necessarily a right fit for Ford and FCA, said David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management.\n\n\"GM was able to concede wage growth and health care costs for the ability to close three factories,\" said Kudla. \"Ford and FCA didn't have three factories that they wanted to close, but will have to work around this new framework for higher wages and unchanged healthcare that the UAW and GM have set.\"\n\nThe union has said it's made significant progress on subcommittee issues with both automakers, but final economic provisions and production promises remain to be worked out. That means those contracts remain uncertain and both companies are still vulnerable to strikes if union negotiators want to play that card.\n\n\"Just because there was a GM strike does not mean the other two are off the hook,\" said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\nSeparately, the UAW Mack Truck Council announced late Thursday that they have reached a tentative agreement, suspending a nearly two-week strike. Mack workers will be scheduled to return to their jobs. Mack Trucks has five facilities in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Florida.\n\nLordstown's end\n\nThe ratification spells an end to GM\u2019s now idle Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio.\n\nGM is in talks to sell the facility to an investor group, Lordstown Motors, backed by electric truck maker Workhorse. But the local union members wanted GM to give the plant a new product to build after GM stopped building the Chevrolet Cruze compact car there in March.\n\nThe contract did not include a new product for Lordstown. It also does not include language to build a battery cell manufacturing facility near Lordstown, which was something GM proposed to the UAW during negotiations. But a GM spokesman confirmed the battery cell plant is still part of GM\u2019s plans.\n\nLocal 1112, which represents Lordstown, voted to reject the proposed contract.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re all disappointed and angry over what happened,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Hara, president of Local 1112. \u201cFor our members, they have to make some decisions now that they hoped they didn\u2019t have to make. Many of them transferred to other plants and left their families behind hoping they\u2019d return to Lordstown one day.\u201d\n\nLocal 1112 now represents less than 20 workers at Mahoning County Jobs and Family Services and Infinite Synergy in Youngstown, Ohio.\n\n\u201cObviously, we have a lot of decisions to make as far as the local union,\u201d said O\u2019Hara. \u201cWe\u2019ll sit down internally and we\u2019ll have discussions with people at the regional level to see where we go from here.\u201d\n\nThe local has enough finances to make it into early next year, he said. The potential of Lordstown Motors buying the plant and GM building a battery cell maker are options given, \u201cthey\u2019re saying they want their workers to be UAW,\u201d said O\u2019Hara.\n\nBut those are 18 to 24 months down the road, \u201cso we can\u2019t sustain ourselves financially that long. So I don\u2019t know what that means for Local 1112.\u201d\n\nThe bitter battle\n\nThe strike against GM has been prolonged and at times painful. At one point, a public exchange of words saw GM insinuating the UAW was moving too slowly in negotiations and not responding to company proposals. The UAW fired back that GM was not taking the union seriously.\n\nAfter that, it took the heavyweights coming to the table to reignite progress toward a deal. GM CEO Mary Barra and UAW President Gary Jones met with negotiators just days before the two sides finally reached a tentative agreement.\n\nFlint Assembly electrician Mike Perez (center left) of Saginaw and (center rightly) Flint Assembly Electrician Alex Rodriguez of Detroit talk while standing on strike at the north gate of General Motors Flint Assembly on Wednesday, October 16, 2019. (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press)\n\nMany UAW leaders and labor experts said that despite the prolonged and sometimes-contentious negotiations, the agreement is a big win for UAW-represented workers at 55 GM facilities in 10 states who had been on strike since 12:01 a.m. Sept. 16.\n\nThe deal provides 4% lump sum wage payments in years one and three and 3% base wage increases in alternating years. It gets rid of long-term temporary worker status and holds hourly workers' share of health care costs to 3%, among other provisions.\n\nIt also keeps GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant running by adding an electric pickup and other electric trucks. GM will invest $3 billion in the plant, which also will assemble batteries, and bring in 2,225 new jobs when it's at full volume.\n\nWarren Tech Center will get a new vehicle program, $200 million investment and retention of approximately 75 jobs under the agreement. Lansing Delta and Spring Hill, Tennessee, assembly plants get a next generation midsize SUV assembly worth $1 billion and 5,000 jobs.\n\nStrike fallout\n\nThe ratification vote comes at a crucial time. The strike has already cost GM nearly a half-billion dollars a week. Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing said it cost GM another $400 million for the entire next week that the union remained out conducting ratification meetings with ballots due by Oct. 25.\n\nGM has had to temporarily shutter other North American plants. On Oct. 19, GM halted production of its new 2020 Chevrolet Blazer SUV at its Ramos Arizpe Vehicle Assembly in Mexico due to a parts shortage from the UAW nationwide strike.\n\nGM's decision to build the Blazer in Mexico instead of a U.S. plant was a sore point with the UAW, as is low-cost Mexican production in general.\n\nThe 2019 Chevrolet Blazer is introduced on Thursday, June 21, 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo: Steve Fecht for Chevrolet)\n\nAlso, GM's production of the 2020 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups at its Silao Assembly Plant in Mexico along with production of the previous generation pickups at GM's Oshawa plant in Ontario, both went down during the strike because of a parts shortage.\n\nThe Corvette plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, was to be retooled this month to build the much-anticipated 2020 Stingray, but that will be delayed while it finishes orders for the 2019 model.\n\nMany of GM's car dealers complained of a lack of parts to perform repairs in the service lanes. And, 100,000 related workers saw their income impacted because of the strike, economists said.\n\nLikewise, UAW workers were getting by on $250 a week for almost a month until the union raised the strike wage to $275 a week on week Oct. 13. The cost to UAW workers is $14 million per day while they remain on strike and not working, Anderson Economic Group said.\n\nThe terms\n\nHere are a few highlights of the new contract:\n\nUAW-represented GM workers will get a bonus of $11,000 upon ratification of the deal. Temporary workers get $4,500.\n\nSo-called in-progression workers hired after 2007 get a faster path to top pay. Under the previous contract, those workers started at $17 an hour, reaching $28/hour after eight years. Under the proposal, that is shortened to four years.\n\nTemporary workers, who have been paid $15-19 an hour with inferior benefits to permanent autoworkers, get a path to a permanent role starting next year. Part-time workers get a path to regular status starting in 2021. These workers also get improved paid and unpaid time off.\n\nThe union has full approval authority and the ability to monitor the number of temporary employees working in the plants. Furthermore, the company now must have approval of the union to supplement the workforce for straight time, overtime or weekend work in any plant covered by the UAW GM National Agreement. The company may use part-time temporary employees only with UAW approval.\n\nGM will invest $7.7 billion in U.S. facilities to create or retain 9,000 jobs.\n\nNewer union workers with two weeks' vacation a year will get to take one of those weeks at their choosing rather than having to take both paid vacation weeks during scheduled plant shutdowns.\n\nThe profit-sharing formula of $1,000 for workers for each $1 billion in North American pretax profit is unchanged but the $12,000 cap is removed.\n\nThere are assistance packages for workers at Lordstown, Warren and Baltimore transmission plants, including $75,000 payments for eligible production workers and $85,000 for skilled workers who retire. There are also buyout options for those not eligible to retire.\n\nAlthough joint activities focused on health and safety and other issues between the union and GM continue, the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources would be dissolved under a memorandum of understanding. The center has become embroiled in the UAW corruption scandal and several people connected to the running of the center stand accused of misusing funds. The Free Press had earlier reported on the likelihood of the closure.\n\nMore: UAW-GM deal calls for raises, $11K ratification bonus, Lordstown closure, pathway for temps\n\nMore: UAW got a good deal from GM, labor leaders, experts say\n\nMore: Fallout from UAW GM strike continues with Blazer build halted in Mexico\n\nFollow Jamie L.
