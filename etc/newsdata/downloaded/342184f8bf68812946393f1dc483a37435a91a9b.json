At his first start this season at 1,400m he could not catch up and Grant [Van Niekerk] told me he thought 1,600m would be more suitable for him.\u201d\n\nRight Choice began his 2019-20 campaign in the same race as Mission Tycoon and was almost 10 lengths off winner Green Luck, prompting Lor to explore his options.\n\nThe five-year-old was ultra-impressive in his debut season, winning five times from 1,200m up to 1,600m, but faded towards the end of the term.\n\n\u201cHe was in the same race as Mission Tycoon \u2013 1,650m at Happy Valley \u2013 and jockey [Umberto Rispoli] said \u2018I needed to push him all the way\u2019, so I think he needs a bit further.\u201d Lor said. \u201cI think 1,800m should be OK for him.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s hand includes Helene Leadingstar, Savvy Six and Star Performance, with the latter shaping as the strongest chance of victory.\n\nThe four-year-old landed in Hong Kong in March after running at Group Two level in New Zealand and has impressed immediately.\n\nAfter winning his Hong Kong debut in Class Three over 1,400m last season, the gelding produced a fighting third behind King Opie at the mile and looks a progressive type.\n\nJoao Moreira is in the saddle on Saturday and believes the horse can perform well this weekend and push on to become a strong performer in next year\u2019s four-year-old series.\n\n\u201cIt was good, he was a bit green but he was still able to finish off the race and run a good third,\u201d Moreira said of Star Performance\u2019s first-up run.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite confident. He\u2019s one of those horses that is still in the learning process but is definitely going to end up high [in the ratings]. He\u2019s a very nice horse going forward and the more ground he steps up to the better it\u2019s going to be for him.\u201d\n\nOf the other five runners in the race, Chris So Wai-yin\u2019s Tianchi Monster and John Size\u2019s Enrichment also came through last season\u2019s four-year-old series and boast solid form at the course and distance.", "description": "Frankie Lor Fu-chuen and Tony Cruz dominate the entries for the Class Two Tsuen Fu Handicap (1,800m) with six of the 11 runners and Lor expects to know a lot more about his trio late on Saturday afternoon....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/11/47aded0e-ec00-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_164604.JPG?itok=brCx_AqG&v=1570783572", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
