It is therefore him, not the opposition, that\u2019s guilty of an \u201cact of surrender\u201d.\n\nRoger Hinds\n\nSurrey\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s conference speech\n\nI read Rob Merrick\u2019s account of Boris Johnson\u2019s criticism of parliament in his customary stand-up comedian\u2019s manner. But this is not Live at the Apollo, because life-changing and existential decisions are being made that affect us and our friends and neighbours in the EU. It is misleading to blame parliament, because many MPs have struggled valiantly to deal with this issue and have tried to be proactive in their approach.\n\nHis mantra of coming out of the EU on the 31 October with or without a deal is completely perplexing \u2013 maybe he has a \u201ccunning plan\u201d to circumvent the Benn Act, but I am not convinced. Of course, this was a speech to the party faithful and, by looking at their reverential faces, they obviously see Johnson as the facilitator of all things Brexit and our imminent departure. I was saddened to witness the lack of response to the \u201cWe are European, we love Europe\u201d line \u2013 but therein lies the rub. If the EU turns down these new proposals, this will be an overture to more anti-European feeling and sentiment, and I for one dread this trajectory into island isolation, where Britain sees it itself omnipotent on the world\u2019s stage.\n\nThe curtain will probably fall quite sharply on this vainglorious strategy. Why do I think so? I am not a \u201cgloomster\u201d, just a realist who so values our EU membership \u201cwarts and all\u201d.\n\nJudith A Daniels\n\nGreat Yarmouth\n\nWhen will Britain\u2019s \u2018mum\u2019 step in?\n\nRather than a Queen\u2019s speech, I should like to see Her Majesty address the people in a televised broadcast akin to that of her Christmas message. She would bring her calm and veiled dignity to help appease the divisive and sometimes even violent nature of this terrible period in our history. She is respected, and loved, by many, even some anti-royalists. She is a \u201cMummy to the Nation\u201d. An unprecedented move perhaps, but these are troubled times.\n\nRachel Greenwood\n\nBewdley\n\nNo care for Ireland\n\nBoris\u2019s latest Brexit dishwash shows he has the same grasp, care and understanding of Ireland as he has of race issues, women, foreign diplomacy and proper conduct in public office \u2013 ie none.\n\nAmanda Baker\n\nEdinburgh", "description": "The PM\u2019s new offering of a \u201ccompromise\u201d to Brussels is so obviously absurd, unworkable and unacceptable to Ireland and the EU\u00a0that its true purpose can only be window-dressing.
