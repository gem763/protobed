summing up the region's furiously complicated politics in one striking image.\n\nVideo taken outside of the city of Kobane on Monday shows a convoy of American tactical vehicles driving away from the conflict zone with the stars and stripes flying.\n\nDriving in the opposite direction is a Toyota truck filled with troops belonging to Bashar al-Assad, with the Syrian government flag hoisted above the driver's cab.\n\nIt comes after President Trump ordered US troops to withdraw from Kurdish territory and hand control of regional security over to Turkish President Erdogan - who promptly attacked the Kurds, which he views as a terrorist group.\n\nThis is the moment American troops (left side of the road) ordered to withdraw from their positions around Kobane - abandoning the Kurds to face a Turkish invasion - passed Syrian government troops (centre) going in the opposite direction to defend them\n\nBashar al-Assad's men rolled into Kurdish territory on Monday to help fight off an invasion of northern Syria by Turkey, which was sparked when Donald Trump withdrew US forces\n\nThe Kurds, who were America's closest allies in the region until last week, are now fighting alongside Syrian government troops who are backed by Russia (pictured)\n\nSyrian regime troops moved into Manbij, Raqqa, Ain Issa, Tal Tamr, and Kobane on Monday to counter a Turkish offensive which began a week ago\n\nFacing a Turkish onslaught the Kurds signed a hastily-arranged pact with Russian-backed Syrian government forces, who agreed to defend them in return for territory.\n\nAs the Americans withdrew from their positions on Monday, Syrian government troops moved up to the front lines to replace them.\n\nAssad's tanks rolled into positions close to the city of Manbij, even as Erdogan said Turkish troops were ready to attack.\n\nSyrian army soldiers also reinforced positions close to the border towns of Tel Abaid and Sari Kani, which had seen heavy fighting over the weekend.\n\nRaqqa - the de-facto capital of ISIS until its self-declared Caliphate was toppled - and Al Tabqah - the site of a major airbase and dam - also received reinforcements.\n\nTurkey's assault on northern Syria entered its seventh day Tuesday as Erdogan's troops try to carve out a 20mile-wide 'peace corridor' along the southern border.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters fire a truck mounted heavy gun near the town of Tukhar, north of Syria's northern city of Manbij, as they prepare for an attack on the city\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters take part in a battle in Syria's northeastern town of Ras al-Ain, also known as Sari Kani, after seizing it from the Kurds\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters raise the Syrian opposition flag at the border town of Tel Abyad after seizing it from the Kurds\n\nSmoke rises from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, as seen from the Turkish side of the border, as Erdogan's forces attack the Kurdish-held city\n\nThe Turkish President says the corridor is necessary to secure the territorial integrity of Turkey, and to resettle some 2million Syrian refugees currently in Turkish territory.\n\nHowever, since Turkey considers the Kurds a terror group and since most of the refugees are Arab, critics are concerned the move will amount to ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe move comes after Trump agreed to withdraw American troops from the region, though he denies giving Turkey the green-light for an invasion, and has imposed sanctions on Erdogan in response.\n\nTrump called Erdogan Tuesday to demand an immediate ceasefire, amid reports that Turkey has been deliberately shelling ISIS prisons in the region in an attempt to free fighters locked up there.\n\nErdogan's critics have warned that his invasion will likely lead to a resurgence of ISIS in the region, as the Kurds divert forces to fight the Turks.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said he was being dispatched 'as quickly as possible' to negotiate a ceasefire after Erdogan's forces stormed into northern Syria.\n\nSyrian government forces gathering Tabqa air base in Syria's Raqqa region, which is also the site of a major hydroelectric dam\n\nSyrian government force in Al Tabqa on Monday, after they were deployed to Kurdish territory to help defend them against Turkey\n\nPeople ride motorcycles and hold a Syrian flag and a portrait of Syrian President Bashar Assad as they welcome Syrian troops to the town of Tal Tamr\n\nPence said the president is 'very concerned about instability in the region' but denied that Trump had started it.\n\n'The United States of America simply is not going to tolerate Turkey's invasion in Syria any further,' Pence said.\n\n'We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table.'\n\nHe spoke just over two hours after Trump washed his hands publicly of the Kurds and invited 'Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte' to save them.\n\nAnd he announced that his administration aims to punish Turkey's incursion into Syria by cancelling a $100 billion trade agreement, hiking import tariffs on Turkish steel, and readying economic sanctions against anyone in Erdo\u011fan's government who threatens 'peace, security, or stability' in Syria.\n\nBut that same government is effectively holding around 50 U.S. nuclear weapons hostage at the strategically-vital air base at Incirlik, which stores part of the American nuclear deterrent and is also being used by Turkish planes to support its invasion of northern Syria.\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian fighters gather around a Turkish army tank near the city of Manbij, which Turkey said it was ready to attack on Monday\n\nTurkish troops walk alongside an armoured personnel carrier through the town of Tukhar, near Syria's northern city of Manbij as they prepare to attack\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian fighters line up to pray a on the northern outskirts of the Syrian city of Manbij near the Turkish border\n\nTurkey is a NATO ally. It's also the aggressor whose military incursion both the Syrian army and the Kurds are trying to push back. And sitting inside the Incirlik air base 250 miles inside Turkey, whose operation the U.S. has shared since the mid-1950s, are about 50 American tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nA senior U.S. official told The New York Times on Monday that the WMDs, though under American control, have effectively become Erdo\u011fan's hostages.\n\nThe United States has 180 of these weapons, precision-guided B61-12 nuclear bombs, spread across allied bases in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.\n\nLeaving a large number of them at Incirlik could become a deadly security risk in a nation whose artillery have already fired across the border on U.S. military units as they bugged out of Syria.\n\nPulling them out would signal an end to a military alliance that gives the United States a crucial staging ground for Middle East operations.\n\nMission: Mike Pence is being sent to the Middle East to hold talks on peace but said: 'The United States of America did not give a green light for Turkey to invade Syria.' Erdogan moved his forces almost immediately after Trump signaled he would pull them out of northern Syria\n\nSanctions threat: Donald Trump announced the threat of sanctions against Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a Monday afternoon statement", "description": "American troops ordered to withdraw from their positions around the Kurdish-held city of Kobane on Monday were filmed driving past Syrian government troops going the other way.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/08/19727916-0-image-a-23_1571124168986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
