Get Me Out Of Here!\n\nKym recently revealed she's leaving Corrie after 13 years to concentrate on other projects.\n\nAnd she appeared to heavily hint about an upcoming jungle stint in a Good Morning Britain appearance, cheekily saying \"never say never\" to getting the I'm A Celeb call.\n\nHowever, Kym has already signed up to perform in Elf the musical later this year, which starts in December, which makes getting to and from the jungle pretty unlikely.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
