(Paul White/Associated Press)\n\nEleven days after Blanca Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa, an Olympic skiing bronze medalist in 1992, went missing in the mountains near Madrid, triggering a search by hundreds of officials and volunteers who combed the pine-forested area for days, her body was found Wednesday.\n\nAuthorities are investigating the cause of her death.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez, 56, was reported missing Aug. 24. The disappearance of Spain\u2019s first female medalist in the Winter Olympics set off a search by more than 200 police officers on foot and on horses, forest rangers and hundreds of volunteers. The Policia Nacional on Wednesday tweeted condolences to family and friends and sent \u201ca million thanks\u201d to the volunteers who helped with the search.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez reportedly often liked to take long hikes in the mountains, and so no one gave it much of a thought when she told her daughter, Olivia Fresneda, that she was going out Aug. 23. She was last spotted on surveillance video at a shopping mall Aug. 24.\n\nShe had not taken her cellphone, however, and family members grew concerned when they lost contact with her. Their worry grew when her Mercedes was found Sept. 1 parked at a popular hiking spot in Cercedilla in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountains, about an hour northwest of Madrid. In it were her driver\u2019s license and 15 euros. \u201cI think she must have gone to the family\u00b4s favorite area,\u201d her sister, Dolores, said this week. \u201cI am sure she decided to go there and something has happened to her. I can\u2019t think of any other explanation. We are extremely sad but we wanted to thank you all for the big effort you are doing in finding Blanca.\"\n\nIn the days since her disappearance, her family, with son, David, reportedly joining the search, had congregated in the mountains, hoping that Fern\u00e1ndez would be found safe.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez, who won a bronze medal in Alpine skiing at the Games in Albertville, France, was one of five siblings who competed at the Olympics for the Spanish ski team. Her late brother, Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa, was the first Spaniard to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics, winning the slalom in 1972 in Sapporo.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with El Pais, Fern\u00e1ndez said she had become more interested in golf than skiing since retiring.\n\n\u201cI ended up burned [out] with skiing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I really like is golf.\u201d\n\nBoth of her children were more interested in rugby, with her daughter a standout on the national team.\n\nNews about Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s death brought reactions from NBA star Pau Gasol, the Real Madrid organization, Formula 1 driver Carlos Sainz and others who praised her as a legend of Spanish sports.\n\nQu\u00e9 triste desenlace.
