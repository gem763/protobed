As Connor landed, the impact pushed the left handlebar into his side.\n\nConnor tried to get to his feet, but his legs buckled. \u2018I saw blood was pouring from just below my stomach on my left side,\u2019 he says. \u2018It was all over the front of my T-shirt and I called out to Jack that I was bleeding before collapsing on to the ground.\u2019\n\nThe force of the impact had severed his femoral vein \u2014 one of the body\u2019s main veins located in the upper thigh and pelvic region. There was a risk he could bleed to death.\n\nBut, rather than panicking, Jack calmly took action. Just weeks earlier, both boys had joined the Army Cadets, where they had been trained in emergency first aid.\n\nWere it not for that, the outcome could have been very different. Their story vividly highlights what a difference even basic first aid skills can make.\n\nJack (right) ripped off his T-shirt and pressed it against the wound to apply pressure and stem the bleeding coming from Connor (left) and used his other hand to call for an ambulance and his mother, Emma, 36 (centre)\n\n\u2018When Connor fell on to the floor after standing up, I thought he was messing about,\u2019 recalls Jack, now 15.\n\n\u2018But then I saw that he was covered in blood and I ran to help. I felt scared as I had never seen so much blood and Connor was frightened, but I knew it was important to stay calm and recall my training.\u2019\n\nJack ripped off his T-shirt and pressed it against the wound to apply pressure and stem the bleeding.\n\nWith his other hand he dialled 999 on his mobile phone and asked for an ambulance.\n\n\u2018I told them that my brother had impaled himself on his bike handlebars,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018Connor kept saying: \u201cI want to go to sleep\u201d, but I\u2019d been taught how important it was to keep a patient conscious so they could tell you if they started to feel worse, so I kept him talking.\u2019\n\nJack also called his mother, Emma, 36, who arrived at the scene, two miles from their home near Leeds, just before the paramedics.\n\nRetired physiotherapist and grandfather of five, Malcolm Robinson, 71, owes his life to the prompt action of off-duty nurse Judy Lewis (pictured together), who administered first aid after he collapsed suffering a cardiac arrest in April 2017\n\n\u2018The wound was jagged and like something from a horror movie,\u2019 recalls the full-time mother of four who is married to Lee, 40, a warehouse operative.\n\n\u2018Blood was pouring and you could see tissue hanging out. I was so shocked I couldn\u2019t even speak, but Jack was so in control I instinctively trusted him to carry on doing the right thing.\u2019\n\nShockingly, despite being in a crowded park that day, only one other person, a girl, came forward to help. \u2018That really surprised me,\u2019 says Emma. \u2018But I honestly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have been able to respond myself. It\u2019s a scary situation to be in \u2014 but for a kid it\u2019s even more terrifying.\u2019\n\nConnor was taken to Leeds General Infirmary for surgery.\n\n\u2018The doctors said Jack had saved his brother\u2019s life. It makes me go cold thinking about how differently it could have ended,\u2019 says Emma.\n\nConnor was very lucky. Scans showed the handlebar had just missed his liver and kidney. And had Jack not stemmed the blood, Connor could have lost consciousness and had a cardiac arrest, says Dr Lynn Thomas, medical director of St John Ambulance.\n\nAnd I owe my life to a guardian angel passing away Retired physiotherapist and grandfather of five, Malcolm Robinson, 71, lives in Sutton Coldfield with his wife, Ann, 59. He owes his life to the prompt action of off-duty nurse Judy Lewis, who administered first aid after he collapsed suffering a cardiac arrest in April 2017. \u2018I remember little of that day, except catching a bus into Birmingham to meet my wife and texting her to say I didn\u2019t feel well,\u2019 says Malcolm. \u2018We went on a walk, only for me to keel over on the way to the restaurant. \u2018A passer-by dialled 999, but mistook my gasps \u2014 a reflex that occurs when the heart stops beating \u2014 as a sign I was still breathing. As a result, the call wasn\u2019t treated as an emergency. Thankfully, Judy happened to be driving past and stopped to help. She began CPR and, vitally, alerted the call handler that I was a non-breathing casualty. \u2018Over the next 26 minutes, she twice got me breathing and laid me in the recovery position, only to \u201close\u201d me again and have to restart CPR. Another bystander, who we have never managed to trace, helped Judy, and between them they kept me going until paramedics arrived and re-started my heart with a defibrillator. \u2018I needed emergency surgery to insert three stents to open the blocked blood vessel that had triggered my heart attack and subsequent cardiac arrest. Judy phoned the hospital to see if I was OK and spoke to Ann, who cried as she said she had been trying to find her to say thank you. \u2018It was sobering to realise that, without Judy\u2019s intervention, the outcome would have been very different. \u2018A few months later, Judy came to a family lunch, which was emotional for us all. \u2018I decided I needed to say thank you by giving something back. Together with the lead resuscitation officer from my local health trust, I formed CPR Counts \u2014 providing free, local life-saving courses. Knowing there are now 700 more potential lifesavers thanks to our courses is a great feeling.\u2019 cprcounts.com\n\nConnor was in hospital for five days, and for the rest of the school holidays he used a wheelchair as he could not walk very far.\n\nWhile Connor is now considering a career in medicine as a result of his brother\u2019s actions, last week Jack was presented with a St John Ambulance Young Hero Award for his quick response.\n\nDr Thomas says: \u2018Situations like this happen every day in Britain, and so many times the outcome is not positive because, unlike this young man, people are scared to come forward and do something.\u2019\n\nResearch conducted in 2017 by the British Red Cross found that just 5 per cent of adults had the skills and confidence to provide emergency first aid. A 2015 survey for the British Heart Foundation revealed that 60 per cent of people worried they wouldn\u2019t know what to do if they witnessed someone having a cardiac arrest \u2014 and only 20 per cent were able to recognise the signs of one.\n\nThe good news is that, following years of campaigning from organisations such as St John Ambulance, the British Red Cross and the British Heart Foundation, first aid lessons will be compulsory in all state schools from September 2020.\n\nChildren will start learning the basics from the age of five. \u2018By the time they leave primary school, they will know how to treat a basic head injury and make a 999 call \u2014 telling the call handler what the problem is and where they are,\u2019 says Dr Thomas.\n\n\u2018By the time they leave secondary school, they will have been taught additional skills, including how to do CPR if someone has a cardiac arrest, and how to use a defibrillator, a device to shock a heart in cardiac arrest into beating normally.\u2019\n\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson told Good Health the vision is to \u2018help us create a new generation of lifesavers\u2019.\n\nCharities like St John Ambulance hope that the classroom policy kick-starts a national first aid awareness initiative \u2014 with children passing on knowledge to families and encouraging them to be first aid-trained as well.\n\nDr Thomas, who is also an acute medical unit doctor at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, says: \u2018We need to keep teaching out in the community \u2014 reminding each other how to do this \u2014 until first aid and CPR become part of your muscle memory, and your instinct is not to run in the opposite direction but to go straight to that person to see what you can do to help.\n\n\u2018It is nearly always better to do something than nothing,\u2019 she adds. \u2018The more you use your first aid, the more the fear factor disappears.\u2019\n\nShe says some people hold back, worrying they will get into trouble if they do something wrong.\n\n\u2018In fact, legally, that\u2019s not the position. If you are helping someone, and doing everything you can, you are fine.\n\n\u2018In France, you are legally obliged to help if you come across a road traffic accident. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s made any difference to outcomes, but maybe this is the route we need to consider in this country.\n\n\u2018But anything you can do \u2014 even being able to give a coherent message to the emergency call handler \u2014 is going to make a difference. Doing nothing will not help a person survive.\u2019\n\nFor information about first aid courses see sja.org.uk.", "description": "Jack Smith, from Leeds, saved his brother, Connor Osborne, then 13, from bleeding to death by ripping off his T-shirt to stem the bleeding and using his free hand to call an ambulance.", "authors": ["Fiona Duffy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/19716774-0-image-a-2_1571097213797.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
