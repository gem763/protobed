(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File)\n\nMitt Romney, who seemingly only has the ability to speak out against Donald Trump, has spent the last few weeks virtue signaling his pants off over the Ukraine issue. While he can never be counted on to condemn Democrats for basically anything, he\u2019s always there with a tweet on Trump to soak up those CNN backslaps. I\u2019m told that\u2019s the ultimate act of courage.\n\nHis plan may go deeper than gathering plaudits though. A new report says he\u2019s rallying Republican Senators to remove the President from office, assuming the House every stops being terrified of voting to actually impeach.\n\nRomney rejecting donors\u2019 calls for him to primary Trump, but he\u2019s planning to rally Senate Republicans to vote against Trump in impeachment trial. My latest:https://t.co/ps0SCpY8CC \u2014 Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) October 8, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s two parts to this. Let\u2019s start with GOP donors begging Romney to run.\n\nAccording to sources, donors have in recent days called the Utah senator and encouraged him to run against Trump in the primary. \u201cThere is a half-billion dollars on the sidelines from guys who are fed up with Trump,\u201d a GOP donor told me.\n\nI\u2019m going to put aside everything I think about or don\u2019t think about Trump for a second. Let\u2019s pretend he doesn\u2019t exist. How can any GOP donor be so idiotic as to not recognize that the party simply does not want another Mitt Romney run, nor a run by someone like him? Even if you despise Trump, Romney is not the alternative. You want to rally the base around Trump? Start pushing Romney to the forefront.\n\nIn that sense, it\u2019s probably smart for him to not run directly against Trump. Instead, he\u2019s doing the underhanded thing by trying to get him removed from office to clear a path.\n\nInstead, a Romney adviser told me, Romney believes he has more potential power as a senator who will decide Trump\u2019s fate in an impeachment trial. \u201cHe could have tremendous influence in the impeachment process as the lone voice of conscience in the Republican caucus,\u201d the adviser said. In recent days, Romney has been reaching out privately to key players in the Republican resistance, according to a person briefed on the conversations. \u201cRomney is the one guy who could bring along Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Ben Sasse. Romney is the pressure point in the impeachment process. That\u2019s why the things he\u2019s saying are freaking Republicans out.\u201d\n\nThat highlighted sentence is the most Mitt Romney thing ever. Voters are sick of pompous cowards who only speak up when they think it will benefit them politically. Romney was nowhere to be found when Adam Schiff lied about contact with the whistle-blower. He completely lost his tongue on any matter dealing with the Trump-Russia investigation, the collapse of the Steele dossier, the lies about collusion, etc. When Obama did any number of things that were objectionable to conservatives during his tenure, Romney got lost in the woods.\n\nBut he sees an opening here with Trump that could help him politically, so he\u2019s ready to speak up again. That\u2019s not courage and it makes him the worst kind of Republican.\n\nAs to him rallying Senators like Collins, Gardner, and Sasse, I\u2019m skeptical. No doubt he will try, because again, he sees that as a path to 2020. But the only way any GOP Senators aside from Romney (and maybe Collins) vote to remove Trump is if they feel like it\u2019s 100% safe in doing so. If they vote and it fails, they are finished in the party and they know it. That means Romney would need to gather another dozen plus votes from his own side and hold them all together over time. That\u2019s just so unlikely as to be nearly impossible.\n\nWhat we currently have is behavior by the President that we can argue back and forth on all day. Was it bad? Was it just turnabout being fair play given what Obama did investigating Trump? Was he actually just wanting a broad look at the 2016 election meddling, of which I\u2019ve been assured by Mitt Romney is very important to get to the bottom of? I\u2019m not here to convince you one way or the other. What I do believe is that there\u2019s nothing impeachable here. There was no quid pro quo. We have the transcript and we know what it says and doesn\u2019t say. Even the \u201csmoking gun\u201d text by Bill Taylor turned out to be based on a Politico article full of supposition, not actual direct knowledge.\n\nIn the absence of an actual, traditionally impeachable offense, Mitt Romney is just playing games again and noway should any Republican voter reward him for it. Any GOP donor or insider that thinks he\u2019s making a comeback is deluding themselves and should probably come to their senses sooner rather than later.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
