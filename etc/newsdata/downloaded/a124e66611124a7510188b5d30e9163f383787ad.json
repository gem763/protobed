This contradicted a 2017 report by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence that found evidence of Russian interference in favour of Mr. Trump Getty 8/29 Contradicting his contradiction of a US intelligence report on Russian meddling Following furious backlash in the US, the President claimed that he meant to say that he saw no reason why it wouldn't have been Russia who meddled in the 2016 US election.

He noted that she was \u201cbleeding badly from a face-lift\u201d at the time, and that he said no MSNBC 21/29 Claiming the blame for Charlottesville was on 'both sides' Trump refused to condemn far-right extremists involved in violence at 'the march for the right' protests in Charlottesville, even after the murder of counter protester Heather Heyer AP 22/29 Retweeting cartoon of CNN being hit by a 'Trump train' Donald Trump retweeted a cartoon showing a Trump-branded train running over a person whose body and head were replaced by a CNN avatar.

The White House initially said that the decision was made after consultation from the Justice Department. Then Mr Trump himself said that he had decided to fire him in part because he wanted the Russia investigation Mr Comey was conducting to stop Getty 25/29 Not realising being president would be 'hard' Just three months into his presidency, Donald Trump admitted that being president is harder than he thought it would be. Though Mr Trump insisted on the 2016 campaign trail that doing the job would be easy for him, he admitted in an interview that living in the White House is harder than running a business empire Reuters 26/29 Accusing Obama of wiretapping him Donald Trump accused former President Barack Obama of wire tapping him on twitter. The Justice Department later clarified: Mr Obama had not, in fact, done so Reuters 27/29 Claiming there had been 3 million 'illegal votes' Donald Trump was never very happy about losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2.8 million ballots. So, he and White House voter-fraud commissioner Kris Kobach have claimed that anywhere between three and five million people voted illegally during the 2016 election. Conveniently, he says that all of those illegal votes went to Ms Clinton.

It didn\u2019t, the day was very dreary Reuters\n\nAt a conference for a pro-Trump group at the president\u2019s Miami golf resort, an incendiary animated video was shown depicting Mr Trump on a gun rampage inside a church, murdering members of the media, political rivals and a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protester.\n\nThere is a long history of sometimes rough language and deeply personal attacks in American politics, from the heated rhetoric surrounding the Clinton impeachment to campaigns that stoked racial division. And the shifting tone isn\u2019t limited to the president and his backers: At the same Minneapolis rally this month where the president went on a swearing spree, anti-Trump protesters chanted profane and angry cheers \u2013 \u201cKill a cop, save a life!\u201d \u2013 while clashing violently with his supporters.\n\nBut the 45th president appears to be presiding over a particularly coarse period of American politics \u2013 inviting the rest of the country to splash around in the muck as he upends long-held norms of acceptable behaviour.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a unique place in modern American history,\u201d said Joshua DuBois, who served in the Obama White House as a faith adviser to the president. \u201cWe have for decades had presidents who\u2019ve tried, oftentimes imperfectly, to appeal to our better angels.\u201d\n\nMr Trump, said Mr DuBois, \u201chas said let\u2019s bring out the nastiness, the division, the bitterness, and let\u2019s use that as a mobilising force and a rallying cry.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Jerry Falwell Jr, president of the evangelical Liberty University, said that he was unaware of those incidents, however, and that Mr Trump\u2019s other profanities do not offend him, though it\u2019s not the way Mr Falwell himself speaks in public.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s part of his personality,\u201d Mr Falwell said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing un-Christian about saying \u2018damn\u2019 or \u2018hell.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAlthough some of Mr Trump\u2019s rhetoric would likely violate the school\u2019s code of conduct barring \u201coffensive or crude language directed at individuals,\u201d Mr Falwell emphasised that the rules only apply to students on campus.\n\n\u201cSo if somebody leaves Liberty University and decides to be president, we\u2019re not going to say they\u2019re bad because they start cussing,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers are less forgiving and say it\u2019s about far more than swear words. Many of Mr Trump\u2019s critics say his racist and racially charged language is particularly damaging.\n\nIn July, Mr Trump tweeted that four minority congresswomen \u2013 all US citizens \u2013 should \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ccrime infested places from which they came.\u201d At his profanity-laden rally earlier this month in Minneapolis, the president attacked Representative Ilhan Omar - the Somali immigrant who represents the city \u2013 as \u201can America-hating socialist\u201d and also attacked the state\u2019s population of Somali refugees, prompting \u201cboos\u201d from the crowd.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a president who is out of control, who says horrible things all the time about minorities, about marginalised populations, about vulnerable populations, and then it is amplified to all these allies the president has made,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, head of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Centre, which has tracked a 30 percent increase in the number of hate groups from 2015 to 2018. \u201cYour garden variety racist or anti-Semite sees this stuff and feels justified for his or her beliefs, and so it\u2019s literally soaking all the way down the culture, from the top down.\u201d\n\nMichael Waldman, who served as chief speechwriter for president Bill Clinton during impeachment and is now president of the Brennan Centre for Justice at New York University School of Law, said that Mr Trump is smashing \u201cthe gravity and majesty of the office\u201d and that \u201chis coarseness and demagoguery are undermining his own use of the bully pulpit.\u201d\n\nBut for Mr Trump, the inflammatory and provocative statements are often intentional. At the Minneapolis rally, he underscored this truth when he gushed to his supporters: \u201cIsn\u2019t it much better when I go off script? Isn\u2019t that better?\u201d\n\nOne of his major targets of late is Hunter Biden, who has come under scrutiny for accepting a paid position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. At a campaign rally in Dallas last week, Mr Trump mocked Mr Biden\u2019s struggles with drug use and said he was \u201cthrown out of the Navy like a dog\u201d \u2013 a reference to Mr Biden\u2019s discharge from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine.\n\n[Republicans] were the ones that made the argument that politics matters in part because it helped set the tone for a nation. Donald Trump is dragging that down Peter Wehner, conservative author who served in three Republican administrations\n\nThe president has also been relentless in his personal assaults on Ms Pelosi, who dubbed Mr Trump \u201ca pottymouth\u201d after his expletive-filled Minneapolis rally. Following a fraught meeting at the White House last week, which ended with some Democrats walking out, Ms Pelosi described Mr Trump as having a \u201cmeltdown\u201d \u2013 prompting Mr Trump to fire back on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi needs help fast!\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThere is either something wrong with her \u2018upstairs,\u2019 or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today.\u201d\n\nMr Trump has also moved boundaries in more risque directions. At one point during his rally in Minneapolis, the president performed a mock conversation between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, two senior FBI employees who exchanged anti-Trump text messages while they were having an affair.\n\n\u201c\u2019I love you, Peter.\u2019 \u2018I love you too, Lisa. Lisa, Lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa,\u2019\u201d Mr Trump said, mimicking imagined dialogue between the two that crescendoed into breathless panting.\n\nRalph Reed, a conservative Christian activist who is working on a book, For God and Country, about how evangelicals are morally correct in supporting Mr Trump and his policies, said that the current moment is not alarming when viewed through the long arc of American history.\n\n\u201cThis is not a crisis on the level of Watergate, the Civil War or the Vietnam War,\u201d Mr Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling but it\u2019s not exactly a red light on the dashboard of danger to civil order. We\u2019ve seen much worse and we\u2019ve lived through much worse.\u201d\n\nPeter Wehner, a Trump critic who served in the past three Republican administrations and is a visiting professor at Duke University, said one irony of Mr Trump\u2019s behavior is that, for years, conservatives had anointed themselves the unofficial gatekeepers of public morality.\n\n\u201cOnce upon a time it was Republicans and social conservatives who spoke most forcefully about the state and condition of our culture, including our political and civic culture,\u201d Mr Wehner said. \u201cThey were the ones that made the argument that politics matters in part because it helped set the tone for a nation. Donald Trump is dragging that down.\u201d\n\nCritics on both sides point to what they see as a general debasement of standards by the other.\n\nIn Minneapolis, an anti-Trump protester spotted a lone man in a blue parka as he left the rally by himself and shouted: \u201cThere\u2019s a Nazi over here!\u201d\n\nA small group of protesters surrounded the man and pulled his ball cap off his head. As he frantically tried to fend them off, a young man walked up and slapped him across the face. The rally goer scuffled with the protesters and repeatedly tried to run away as they chased him, throwing punches.\n\nMany of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls have also begun using foul language, with Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso, often leading the charge in what appears to be an effort to convey passion and authenticity. Representative Rashida Tlaib, one of the congresswomen attacked by Mr Trump, generated controversy earlier this year when she urged her supporters to \u201cimpeach the motherf***er,\u201d referencing Mr Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, at a Trump rally last week in Texas, one of his allies seemed to attempt to channel the president himself. Texas Republican lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, an honorary chairman of Mr Trump\u2019s campaign, warmed up the crowd by mocking \u201cthe rabble\u201d on the Democratic presidential debate stage a couple nights earlier.\n\n\u201cThe progressive left, they are not our opponents \u2013 they are our enemy,\u201d Mr Patrick said.\n\nHe went on to malign Mr O\u2019Rourke as \u201ca moron\u201d and to coin his own nickname for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry: \u201cAdam bull-Schiff.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all bull-Schiff, all the time,\u201d Mr Patrick said. \u201cI was careful with my words. My pastor\u2019s watching.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Donald Trump unleashed a gusher of foul language, referring to himself as a \u201cson of a bitch,\u201d claiming that Joe Biden was a good vice president only because\u00a0\u201che understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass,\u201d\u00a0and saying \u201chell\u201d 18 times \u2013 and that was all in a single campaign rally.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "Ashley Parker"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/12/donald-trump-angry.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
