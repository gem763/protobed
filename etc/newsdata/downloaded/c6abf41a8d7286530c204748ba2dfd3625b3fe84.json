In 2018, Mr. Pence also addressed a conference hosted by the Family Research Council, an organization the liberal Southern Poverty Law Center has included in its listing of hate groups over the FRC\u2019s stand on LGBT issues.\n\nFor his part, President Trump has defended his number two, saying there\u2019s no way Mr. Pence could be \u201canti-gay\u201d since he chose to meet with Ireland\u2019s openly gay taoiseach, or prime minister, Leo Varadkar and his partner.\n\nIn addition to Mr. J\u00f3hannesson\u2019s fashion statement in favor of gay rights, Advania, an IT company located across the street from where Mr. Pence and other world leaders met, switched out its flags for rainbow flags as an expression of solidarity with LGBT activists.\n\n\u201cWe just felt the need to celebrate diversity today and wanted to show that by flying the flags,\u201d \u00c6gir M\u00e1r \u00de\u00f3risson, Advania\u2019s company director, said to the Icelandic news service Monitor.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Mr. J\u00f3hannesson has worn the rainbow bracelet to protest a visiting politician\u2019s involvement with anti-LGBT policies. He has also worn it when meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
