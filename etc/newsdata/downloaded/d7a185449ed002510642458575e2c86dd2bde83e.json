In Rwanda, portable solar-powered kiosks are one option.\n\nKnown as \"Shiriki hubs,\" the mobile kiosks are powered by 100-watt solar panels and can charge up to 30 phones at one time. They can also serve as Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\nUsers pay 5 cents to fully charge a phone and 3 cents for 10 minutes of Wi-Fi at the kiosks, developed by African Renewable Energy Distributor (ARED) . Users can also buy phone airtime and subscriptions to StarTimes, a popular TV network in the region.\n\nARED's hubs serve a key role in keeping Rwandans connected in a place where mobile phones are popular but keeping them powered isn't necessarily easy. In 2017, there were 72 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people in Rwanda, according to the World Bank, yet only 34% of the population had access to electricity.\n\nFounder Henri Nyakarundi leases Shiriki Hubs, solar-powered kiosks that can charge phones and provide Wi-Fi.\n\nHenri Nyakarundi, an entrepreneur who was born in Rwanda, grew up in Burundi and later moved to the United States, says the need for charging stations became apparent to him on a visit home. Seeing an opportunity to start a business that could also provide jobs in his native country, Nyakarundi returned to Rwanda in 2013 to launch ARED.\n\nRead More", "description": "How do you charge a cell phone when you don't have electricity at home?
