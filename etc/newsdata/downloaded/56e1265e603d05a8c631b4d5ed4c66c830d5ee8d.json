I mean we were dumb with the 2-2 (in the 88th through a Michael Delaney own goal). But please don\u2019t start with this mentality crap. That\u2019s enough with this thing now\u201d\n\nWhether there is indeed a mental issue there or not, Dortmund will need to beat Werder if they are not to lose touch with the top spots early.\n\nWith more than half a dozen players out injured, Bremen on paper looks like the perfect opponent for Dortmund at this moment in the season.\n\nWith the return of Nico Schulz from injury, Dortmund\u2019s squad is brimming with talent that includes in-form teenager Jadon Sancho, Reus, Spaniard Paco Alcacer, Germany international Julian Brandt and Belgian midfielder Axel Witsel among others.\n\nBut they have to start a winning run soon as they have yet to show consistently what they are capable of, having failed to win more than two games in a row.\n\nWith Champions League action awaiting next week again Dortmund are quickly running out of time to settle into the season and coach Lucien Favre\u2019s team will have to start delivering.\n\nDortmund are in third place on 10 points, three behind leaders RB Leipzig and one behind Bayern.\n\nLeipzig are hosting improving Schalke 04, who have won their last three league matches to be on 10 points. Victory would put Schalke, who battled to avoid relegation last season, into the top spots.\n\nThe Bavarians have a seemingly easier task than Leipzig, travelling to promoted Paderborn on Saturday.", "description": "Bundesliga title contenders Borussia Dortmund are hosting injury-plagued Werder Bremen on Saturday, hoping to bounce back from last week's surprise draw against Eintracht Frankfurt and prove they are not dealing with a \"mentality issue\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
