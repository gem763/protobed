The v sign was used.\"\n\nHiggins eventually managed to reverse out of his space and drove to another part of the car park, while Mr Gadd followed him on foot to remonstrate with him.\n\nThe court was told that while Mr Gadd was walking on the car park's carriageway, Higgins drove towards him.\n\n(Image: Wales News Service)\n\nMr Williams said: \"As Higgins approached where Mr Gadd was positioned in the carriageway, he deliberately swerved his motor vehicle to the right in order to drive at him.\n\n\"As a result of him doing so Higgins' motor vehicle collided with Mr Gadd with a slight glancing blow.\"\n\nWitness Maggie Pridley told police she saw the Land Rover \"turning into the man\" before its front driver's side corner struck Mr Gadd.\n\n(Image: Wales News Service)\n\nMr Williams said Mr Gadd fell backwards to the road and sustained \"significant and fatal head injuries\", resulting in him bleeding from his ears and nostrils, and despite the efforts of shoppers and paramedics to revive him he was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nHis cause of death was later given as blunt force head injury including complex skull fractures.\n\nThe prosecutor said it was not suggested Higgins intended to kill Mr Gadd or to cause him serious harm, but that by driving in the manner he did he \"unlawfully assaulted\" his alleged victim.\n\n(Image: Wales News Service)\n\nMr Williams also told the court Higgins' passenger, his girlfriend Nia Bailey, was the only person insured to drive the Land Rover that day, as Higgins was not insured and was the holder only of a provisional licence.\n\nIn a police interview, Higgins described seeing Mr Gadd \"marching aggressively\" towards his car while hitting his own fist into his hand, and feared for his partner's safety.\n\nHiggins allegedly told police in an interview: \"I did swerve at the man, he was coming towards the vehicle and I just swerved at him to s*** him up. I didn't mean to hit him.\"\n\nMr Williams said Higgins now denies deliberately swerving or driving towards Mr Gadd.\n\nHe added: \"We say the phrase 's*** him up' means this - trying to scare Mr Gadd.\"\n\nHiggins, from Blackwood, denies manslaughter, causing death while driving uninsured and causing death otherwise in accordance with a licence.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Timothy Higgins is accused of mowing down Christopher Gadd, 48, after they exchanged \"v signs\" over a parking space dispute in Pontllanfraith, South Wales, a court heard", "authors": ["Adam Hale", "Image", "Wales News Service", "Dimitris Legakis Athena Pictures"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20670640.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Trial-of-Timothy-Higgins-who-has-been-charged-with-manslaughter-after-a-shopper-died-following-an-al.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
