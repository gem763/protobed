France's CAC 40 also rose 0.9%.\n\nThe U.K.'s FTSE 100 was the only European market to decline (link), falling by 0.7% as the country's political turmoil deepened. Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost a series of crunch parliamentary votes on Tuesday and Wednesday (link), paving the way for an election in the coming weeks or months that may determine the fate of Brexit.\n\nBut the British pound rallied by 0.6% on investors' hopes that setbacks for the strongly pro-Brexit Johnson mean that the chances of a disorderly and rapid EU exit for the U.K. have diminished.\n\nAmong individual stocks, U.K. regional banking group CYBG PLC (CYBG.LN) was the worst decliner in Europe, as its shares plunged 21% after it reported a larger-than-expected bill of GBP300 million to GBP450 million ($500 million) from penalties tied to the past mis-selling of payment protection insurance, a widespread banking scandal in the U.K. Analysts at Jefferies said that the credibility of the bank's management \"is challenged on PPI, and investors are likely to avoid this share until results on November 28\".\n\nNorwegian energy group Equinor (EQNR.OS) was the region's top gainer, with shares climbing 8% after it announced a $5 billion stock buyback program. Shares in French aerospace group Dassault Aviation (AM.FR) rose by 7.9% after it reported strong results, and U.K.-listed engineering investment company Melrose Industries (MRO.LN) gained 6.7% after its losses halved, indicating a turnaround plan is working.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 05, 2019 07:01 ET (11:01 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
