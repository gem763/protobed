And while there were still plenty of bugs over the course of the iOS 12 cycle, performance was improved\u2014particularly on older devices.\n\nApple hasn\u2019t tempered expectations for iOS 13 this year, so users might be expecting a big leap forward. iOS 13 does bring a new look to the software that runs on iPhones, overhauls a few oft-criticized first-party applications, and puts additional emphasis on user privacy. Most of all, it adds new, powerful interactions for power users\u2014some of which we thought we'd never see in Apple's mobile software.\n\niOS 13 is successful at most of what it sets out to do, even though it leaves some things that users have wanted to see overhauled\u2014like the home screen\u2014relatively untouched.\n\nThe big story this year is about the iPad. Apple has spun off iOS 13 into a distinct version for iPads, called iPadOS. But that\u2019s not part of the initial iOS 13 release\u2014instead it\u2019s coming several days later, alongside iOS 13.1. For that reason, we\u2019re focusing entirely on the iPhone experience in this initial review, and we\u2019ll address the iPad after iPadOS goes live.\n\nToday, we\u2019ll take a look at Dark Mode on the iPhone, assess Apple\u2019s latest efforts on privacy and augmented reality, and examine the changes to the most overhauled apps, including Maps, Photos, and more. There\u2019s frankly more in this update than we can get to in one article (even though several thousand words await you, dear reader), but we've been spending a lot of recent time with iOS 13 in order to thoroughly consider Apple's most significant changes, like those to Reminders and Files, for example.\n\nWe\u2019ll also consider what all these changes mean for the future direction of iOS, which is gradually evolving away from its original philosophy of user experience. There\u2019s a lot to talk about, but let\u2019s start as we always do: with device compatibility.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCompatibility\n\nCompatibility with older devices was a cornerstone of iOS 12 last year because Apple was trying to fight against consumer perception that it purposely and aggressively ends support for older phones in order to drive new phone purchases.\n\nTruth be told, as was the case with iOS 11 and iOS 12, if you want a phone that will get several years of software support rather than just one or two, the iPhone is the way to go. That hasn't changed with iOS 13.\n\niOS 13 drops support for the following iPhone models that were supported by iOS 12: the iPhone 5S, the iPhone 6, and the iPhone 6 Plus. It also ends support for the first iPad Air, the iPad mini 3, and the iPad mini 2. It now supports the somewhat recently released seventh generation iPod touch, but this release drops the sixth generation.\n\nThis is a pretty dramatic culling, though it comes a year after iOS 12 did not drop support for any devices at all that were already supported by iOS 11. You can essentially summarize iOS 13's cuts as Apple declining to support all iOS devices that had only 1GB of RAM.\n\nSupported iPhone models\n\niPhone XS\n\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhone XR\n\niPhone X\n\niPhone 8\n\niPhone 8 Plus\n\niPhone 7\n\niPhone 7 Plus\n\niPhone 6S\n\niPhone 6S Plus\n\niPhone SE\n\nSupported iPad models\n\niPads will soon technically run iPadOS, as distinct from iOS. Here\u2019s which models are supported by this year\u2019s software, though:\n\n12.9-inch iPad Pro\n\n11-inch iPad Pro\n\n10.5-inch iPad Pro\n\n9.7-inch iPad Pro\n\niPad (6th generation)\n\niPad (5th generation)\n\niPad mini (5th generation)\n\niPad mini 4\n\niPad Air (3rd generation)\n\niPad Air 2\n\nSupport iPod models\n\niOS 13 supports the 7th generation iPod touch.\n\nDevices used in the course of this review\n\nWe based most of this review, including the screenshots, on several weeks of using late iOS 13 beta releases and the iOS 13 GM release on an iPhone X, an iPhone XS, an iPhone 8, and over just the past couple days, an iPhone 11 Pro. All testing was done using the GM release of iOS 13, and we verified several things in the final public release after it went live yesterday. We also used an iPhone 6S and iPhone SE to test performance on the lowest-end supported iPhones. We did not test or use iOS 13 on an iPod touch.\n\nDesign: Dark Mode, Share Sheets, and more\n\nThere has not been a major change to the visual design of iOS since 2013, and in some places it shows. But iOS 13 brings the biggest overhaul on this front since iOS 7. Not all of that is about the new Dark Mode feature, but that\u2019s what many users will see first.\n\nWhen you first install iOS 13, you\u2019re asked if you want to use Light Dark or Dark Mode. You\u2019re not stuck with your choice, though, as you can change it in the Settings app at any time (or in the Control Center). You reach it in the Control Center the same way you get to Night Mode: you hold down your finger (either with 3D Touch or Haptic Touch, depending on the device you\u2019re using) on the brightness slider to pop up additional options, then toggle from there. You can also assign this setting to a more prominent place in the Control Center if you'd prefer.\n\nIt\u2019s easiest to talk about Dark Mode by actually going through some images, though, so let\u2019s do that.\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nsamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nAlmost no part of iOS remains untouched by Dark Mode. The only major app exception I found was Weather, which still displays a colored, full-screen image matching the current conditions and time of day.\n\nOther than a few customization options noted in the gallery above, there are no changes in functionality here. Everything is where it used to be; Dark Mode is an aesthetic change. But if you\u2019re in the habit of using your phone in bed late at night while your significant other sleeps next to you, or if you want accurate color and contrast without blinding yourself when walking outside at night, it\u2019s a pleasant addition.\n\nApple has provided third-party app developers (and Web developers) with the means to automatically enable or disable their own dark modes based on the system-wide status. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how many support it\u2014if some don\u2019t (we\u2019re looking at you, Slack-on-the-Mac-for-the-past-year), you might find yourself suddenly awash in white light at undesirable moments as you switch between apps.\n\nThe new share sheet\n\nThe share sheet, that standardized pop-up menu that appears when you try to share something from an app or a webpage in iOS, was functional in iOS 12, but Apple sought to improve it in a few ways with this release. As with Dark Mode, the best way to get it is to see it.\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\n\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nMany of the things you can do in the share sheet could be done before, but Apple has put options that used to be buried in the Settings app in the options menu here instead, for example. It arguably makes for a more organized share sheet experience, depending on your own personal workflow and habits, but it's not a game changer by any means.", "description": "There's a lot more to this update than Dark Mode.", "authors": ["Samuel Axon"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0038-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
