On Monday evening, several workers took up the work of chopping down nearly 10 fully-grown Subabul trees on the campus.\n\nYouTube\n\nWhat made the relentless axing worse, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit coincided with it. While reports claim that the green signal to cut the trees was issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) ahead of the PM's visit, the same is yet to be confirmed.\n\nHowever, authorities deny the coincidence of the tree-chopping to that of PM Modi's visit. The trees were chopped because they 'pose danger to students', they claim.\n\nEven as the trees were being cut on one side of the college area, a stage was being set for the Prime Minister on the other side of the college campus.\n\nDon't Miss 10.9 K SHARES 11.2 K SHARES 2.2 K SHARES 4 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n\nCivic workers assisting with the job produced a document that shows how permission was sought by the college management, from the BJP-controlled PMC for this purpose, reports Mumbai Mirror.\n\nFacebook/Mumbai Mirror\n\nThe permission letter acquired by Mumbai Mirror stated, 'The trees on the ground have grown in a haywire manner.

We sought permission from the Pune Municipal Corporation\u2019s Tree Authority.\u201d\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) strongly emphasized that the trees where being chopped to any avoid untoward incidents.
