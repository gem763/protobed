Photo: Courtesy of L\u2019Oreal Paris\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris has been on a roll with signing women who are older than the \u201cclassic\u201d model age. In the past few years, the company has brought Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren into the fold. More recently, in April, L\u2019Or\u00e9al signed C\u00e9line Dion, and now actress Viola Davis is the newest member. I, for one, couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the past 20 years being vague about my age (shall we call it \u201cvaguing\u201d?), mainly because when I was around 34 or 35 (and feeling that 40 represented the beginning of the end \u2026 ), a friend told me she lied about hers. I thought she was wise, so I followed suit. The older I got, the more my age became my protected secret, and the more I feared being aged out of a world that focused on doing whatever it took to look younger.\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the number still trips up my tongue any time I\u2019m asked how old I am, but it\u2019s like a secret handshake now (\u201cYou\u2019re over 50? Me too!\u201d). More importantly, though, hearing a woman who we all view as the paragon of badass share the insecurities she had about confidence and self-worth illustrates how messed up our culture has been in striving to be not just youthful but model-beautiful.\n\n\u201cAs a young girl, I wasn\u2019t always told that I was smart, beautiful, or worthy,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked tremendously hard to get where I am today \u2014 overcoming feelings of doubt to become a woman who truly believes I am \u2018worth it\u2019 in every way. I believe it\u2019s so important to build confidence in women from a young age and to role-model diverse perspectives of beauty. To now be part of a brand that has been championing women\u2019s worth for more than 40 years and to use my voice to help empower others is truly surreal.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not surreal. Not anymore, anyway. Kudos to L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris for turning surreal into a beautiful reality.", "description": "Viola Davis joins Helen Mirren and Jane Fonda as a L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris ambassador on the heels of the brand\u2019s signing C\u00e9line Dion as a spokesperson.", "authors": ["Jane Larkworthy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/10/10-BEAUTY-PORTRAIT_VIOLA-DAVIS_1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
