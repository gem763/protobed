Exactly how much remains uncertain, but computer modelling suggested concentrations between 0.1 and 50 percent.\n\nBy comparison, the percentage of water vapour in Earth's atmosphere varies between 0.2% above the poles, and up to four percent in the tropics.\n\nThere was also evidence of hydrogen and helium as well. Nitrogen and methane may also be present but with current technology remain undetectable, the study said.\n\nFurther research will be able to determine the extent of cloud coverage and the percentage of water in the atmosphere.\n\nFirst of many\n\nWater is crucial in the search for life, in part because it carries oxygen.\n\n\"Life as we know is based on water,\" said Tinetti.\n\nK2-18b orbits a red dwarf star about 110 light years distant - a million billion kilometres - in the Leo constellation of the Milky Way, and is probably bombarded by more destructive radiation than Earth.\n\n\"It is likely that this is the first of many discoveries of potentially habitable planets,\" said UCL astronomer Ingo Waldmann, also a co-author.\n\n\"This is not only because super-Earths like K2-18b are the most common planets in our galaxy, but also because red dwarfs - stars smaller than our Sun - are the most common stars.\"\n\nThe new generation of space-based star gazing instruments led by the James Webb Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's ARIEL mission will be able to describe exoplanet atmospheres in far greater detail.\n\nARIEL, slated for a 2028 launch, will canvas some 1 000 planets, a large enough sampling to look for patterns and identify outliers.\n\n\"Over 4 000 exoplanets have been detected but we don't know much about their composition and nature,\" said Tinetti. \"By observing a large sample of planets, we hope to reveal secrets about their chemistry, formation and evolution.\"", "description": "Water vapour has been detected in the atmosphere of a super-Earth with habitable temperatures by UCL researchers in a world first.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9353/a44ea4e394644068935c577fba068e4c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
