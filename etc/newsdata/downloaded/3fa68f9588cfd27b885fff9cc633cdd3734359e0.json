No doubt that this expected trade deal can bring some more cheer for Indian equity markets on first trading session of the upcoming week on September 23rd, 2019, as one more boosting dose for Indian equities on Monday; since the India\u2019s Finance Minister announced reforms in the form of corporate tax reduction from 30% to 22%. Effective corporate tax rate after surcharge will be 25.17% on Friday; which resulted in steep upward move in all the Indian equity indices.\n\nNo doubt that both the Indian stalwarts have been constantly working to push the Indian economy up to 5 trillion sizes by 2024, but I find that the rosy road up to next elections of 2024 in India seems to quite familiar with Trump\u2019s plethora of moves in order to win November 2020 elections. I find that both the signatories of the upcoming U.S.-India trade deal look to be heading with the same mind-set. No doubt that the U.S. President looks too ambitious, while he invites some newcomer to extend American exports in order to reduce American fiscal deficit. Since the world\u2019s two major economies of the world, U.S. and China, have finally reached in tariff trade tussle since October 2018. Now, while the Sino-U.S. trade deal seems to remain unresolved, the U.S. President has started to seek a new partner to shift his industries from China. India, being the largest consumer seems to be a fantastic destination for American companies.\n\nI find that this upcoming trade deal may definitely provide new avenues to Indian economy at the new job-creation front, but who knows that this will not turn into one more tariff tussle; when the Indian corporate sector will face tough competition from American goods, whereas the Indian Corporate Secotor find their big consumer-base is in India only. No doubt that, after some time, U.S. Companies would try to monopolize their products in the name of their patent. I do not want to predict that how the Indian Corporate Sector would welcome this step by Indian Prime Minister. But, I know very well that the East India Company entered into India in 1612 and finally empowered them to rule India in 1757 after Battle of Plassey; and continued to rule till 1947. Finally, I find that the economic policies have change a lot now, but the pace of politics is still intact; even after passing through a lot of ups and downs in Indian democracy since 1947.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Satendra Singh covering: .
