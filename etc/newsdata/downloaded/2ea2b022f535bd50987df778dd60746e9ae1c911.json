This failure has a direct and detrimental effect on the lives and safety of the citizens of Nelson Mandela Bay, notably those living in crime riddled areas;\n\n. There was a time when Nelson Mandela Bay was the award winning, cleanest city in the country. This is no longer the case with the collapse of basic cleansing services.\n\nThe Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, said the letter exposes a number of misconceptions, a shallow grasp of the role the chamber is supposed to play and the manner in which it is supposed to engage the leadership and management of the municipality.\n\nBobani added, \u201cIn their letter, they disgenuously create a wrong perception that the municipality is dysfunctional. As this coalition government, we remain committed in working with the Business Chamber to take this city forward. Our doors are always open, they know that.\u201d\n\nBobani stated that the business chamber has decided to ignore their formal engagement processes and platforms and have deliberately taken a direction of a media campaign to discredit the administration.\n\n\u201cThey dishonestly create a perception that we do not want to meet them, knowing exactly that I mandated the Deputy Executive Mayor and the Acting City Manager to meet them and discuss the issues they have raised,\u201d Bobani said.\n\nThe metro has since indicated that they are still prepared to meet and discuss the issues raised.", "description": "CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
