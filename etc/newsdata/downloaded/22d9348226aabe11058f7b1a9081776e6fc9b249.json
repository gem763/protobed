We will continue to work 24/7 for a permanent solution.\u201d\n\nAs of October 2018, there were over 263,000 TPS beneficiaries from El Salvador, court documents show.", "description": "The U.S. government has extended temporary protection for Salvadorans living in the United States by an additional year, the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, Ronald Johnson, said on Monday, in a potential sign of easing tensions over migration.", "authors": ["Nelson Renteria", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
