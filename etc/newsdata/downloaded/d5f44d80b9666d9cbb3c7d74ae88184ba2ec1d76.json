The sea is not a dustbin.\u201d\n\nTwenty-two divers took part in a cleanup in mid-September, using two boats for operations and a third as a floating bin for the rubbish.\n\nBy the close of the operation, they had hauled up 1.4 tonnes of debris \u2014 mainly plastic but also rusty drink cans, torn clothing and other discarded items.\n\nThis gesture for the environment has to be weighed against the realities.\n\nEven though Senegal is in the upper tier of developing economies, it has no recycling facilities.\n\nThe rubbish that was so arduously brought up from the bottom of the sea was sent to a huge garbage tip at Mbeubeuss, where household waste from Dakar\u2019s three million people is discharged.\n\nAccording to the UN, worldwide around eight million tonnes of plastic ends up in the sea, providing a deadly hazard for birds and marine mammals and breaking down into microscopic waste that also enters the food chain.\n\nAround nine billion tonnes of plastic have been produced since the substance was produced on a large scale after World War II, but just nine percent of this has been recycled.\n\nIn Senegal itself, environmental awareness remains low compared with the rising swell of campaigning in the rest of the world. Only a few dozen young people turned out on September 20 for the planet-wide environment rallies.\n\nPresident Macky Sall has said he wants the country to be \u201czero waste\u201d but discarded plastic containers and bags are an eyesore in many towns and villages, and a 2015 law to restrict the use of plastic bags is a dead letter.", "description": "Dakar (AFP) \u2013 When the sight of plastic bags, bottles and other debris littering the seabed becomes too much, there\u2019s just one thing to do:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/411fb6_an-association-amateur-divers-in-senegal-is-removing-plastic-rubblish-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
