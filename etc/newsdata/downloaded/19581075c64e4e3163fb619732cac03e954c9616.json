But rather than distance himself from the growing row, Mr Corbyn's team defended his comments and heaped fresh praise on her.\n\nMr Corbyn's spokesman said: 'Of course Jeremy praised Salma Yaqoob in 2013 for her years of work on anti-war and anti-austerity campaigns. Those campaigns have been vindicated.'\n\nHowever, Yaqoob's 2017 General Election opponent \u2013 Labour MP Naz Shah \u2013 branded her 'unfit for office' as Jewish community groups demanded Labour expel her.\n\nYaqoob was a leading figure in the Respect Party, set up by George Galloway, standing against Labour in multiple elections.\n\nA video has emerged of Mr Corbyn describing Yaqoob as a 'hero' and 'a fantastic activist' in 2013\n\nBut it was her run as an independent in Bradford in 2017 that caused uproar. Last week, Shah claimed Yaqoob's campaign to unseat her had left her 'feeling suicidal'.\n\nLabour's Ruth Smeeth last night slammed Mr Corbyn's comments saying: 'I personally think Salma Yaqoob has no place in our movement, not least because of her behaviour towards Naz Shah in 2017.'\n\nThe Stoke-on-Trent MP added: 'The idea anyone could see her as a hero or a heroine is beyond my comprehension. She has no place in our movement.'\n\nAnd the Labour Against Anti-Semitism campaign said: 'Salma Yaqoob has a track record of allegedly making overtly anti-Semitic public statements. It is beyond belief that she has been shortlisted as a potential candidate for the mayor of West Midlands, a region with a proud history of tolerance and multiculturalism.'\n\nSpokesman Fiona Sharpe added: 'Labour should withdraw Ms Yaqoob from the selection process: there must be no place for someone with her apparently toxic views anywhere in our democratic system.'\n\nCommunity group the Board of Deputies of British Jews also hit out, claiming: 'Not only was Salma Yaqoob formerly a senior associate of George Galloway in the Respect Party but she has also retweeted an article about 'Rothschild bankers' arrested in Iceland \u2013 a clear anti-Semitic trope.'\n\nIts president, Marie van der Zyl, said: 'No one who refers to Jews as 'pigs' could possibly be considered for high office by any reputable party.\n\n'Labour must withdraw her from the shortlist for West Midlands mayor and expel her immediately.'\n\nYaqoob did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Former Respect Party leader and Stop The War acolyte Salma Yaqoob was shortlisted to be Labour's candidate for mayor of the West Midlands, sparking uproar from members and MPs.", "authors": ["Harry Cole Deputy Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20231240-0-image-a-11_1572137988754.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
