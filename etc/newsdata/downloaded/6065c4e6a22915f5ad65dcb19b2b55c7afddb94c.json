He was sentenced to five months in prison.\n\n\u201cSo far as culpability is concerned, I accept that neither of you committed the offences you have pleaded guilty to as a consequence of any financial motive, but rather were driven by morbid curiosity and, in your case, Mr Ashford, by your interest in forensic science,\u201d Peter Crabtree, the sentencing judge, said.\n\n\u201cYou have both accepted that your deliberate accessing of the computer system, in your case, Ms Bray, to watch the autopsy of Emiliano Sala \u2018live\u2019, and in both of your cases to replay the autopsy using the playback facility was, in reality, unauthorised.\n\n\u201cYou both well appreciated that there could have been no justification based on any \u2018security\u2019 grounds for doing so.\n\n\u201cYou have both abused your positions and the access you had in a quite appalling way in watching the autopsies you have, and in taking the photographs and screenshots you did.\n\n\u201cBy those actions, you both showed a level of disrespect such that if knowledge of your conduct became public, as it did, it would cause considerable harm, and risk wider promulgation of any photograph you had taken.\u201d\n\nThe judge added that the pair had shown the \u201cgreatest of disrespect\u201d to Mr Sala\u2018s family and caused them \u201cconsiderable distress\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe welcome today\u2019s sentence and believe it reflects the gravity of the crimes and the great distress caused to the families involved,\u201d Detective Inspector Gemma Vinton, of Wiltshire Police, said.\n\nIn August investigators revealed Mr Sala had been exposed to harmful levels of carbon monoxide before his death.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Two people who illegally accessed CCTV footage of Emiliano Sala\u2019s\u00a0post-mortem examination have been jailed.
