He was very in demand. He had quite obviously a tremendously loving family and everyone wanted to help him out.\u2019\n\nShe said she believed Dr Christie \u2018could not see the wood for the trees\u2019 after becoming so \u2018poorly\u2019 with his mental health.\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Dr Christie\u2019s brother Phil Christie, 39, said: \u2018There is a stigma surrounding doctors and mental health.\n\n\u2018As people become more aware of mental health in society, we have got to become more aware of the people who are taking care of us.\u2019\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Dr Christie\u2019s widow, Juliette, says more needs to be done to support medical professionals who are reluctant to seek help for their mental health for fear it could go on their record and prohibit them from practicing.\n\nShe said: \u2018Suicide is far more prevalent in the medical profession generally.\n\n\u2018We need to understand why this might be and getting them support rather than being concerned with their ability to practice.\u2019\n\nDescribing her husband, she added: \u2018He was deeply concerned about a mental health diagnosis going on his record and affecting his ability to work.\u2019\n\nPhil added: \u2018Miles touched the lives of so many people as a beloved husband, father, son, brother, friend and as a caring doctor to the thousands of patients he looked after as a General Practitioner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Miles lived a wonderful life, seeking out and soaking up all experiences London and the world had to offer.\n\n\u2018We will remember his beaming smile, infectious charm, his brightest of minds, and especially the sight of him unable to speak or breathe through laughter.\n\n\u2018He leaves a huge hole and will be dearly missed, but always remembered.\u2019\n\nA Memorial Fund in Dr Christie\u2019s name has already raised more than \u00a334,000 to support his widow and their two young children.\n\nNeed support?
