They were found stowed with a cargo of tomatoes after a ferry ride from Zeebrugge, the same Belgian port that featured in the latest tragedy.\n\nIn February 2004, 21 Chinese migrants \u2014 also from Fujian \u2014 who were working as shellfish pickers in Britain, drowned when they were caught by treacherous tides in Morecambe Bay in northwest England.\n\nChina's Global Times, which is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Friday editorial that Britain should bear some responsibility for the deaths.\n\n\"Such a serious humanitarian disaster occurred under the eyes of the British and Europeans,\" the newspaper said.\n\n\"Britain and the related European countries have not met their responsibility for protecting these people from dying in such a manner.\"", "description": "Police investigating the deaths of 39 people believed to be Chinese nationals who were found in a truck and trailer near London said they arrested two more people on Friday on suspicion of human trafficking, and continued to quiz the driver as a murder suspect.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334922.1572006691!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-bodies.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
