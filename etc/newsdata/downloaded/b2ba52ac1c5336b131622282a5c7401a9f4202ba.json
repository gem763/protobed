The protesters also celebrated Boston Celtics\u2019 player Enes Kanter, who did not mention James by name but posted several messages on Twitter Monday appearing to challenge him, concluding with the phrase, \u201cfreedom is not free.\u201d\n\nKanter has previously referred to James as a \u201cprincess.\u201d\n\nKanter, a follower of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, has been embroiled in a years-long battle with authoritarian Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that has culminated in his father\u2019s imprisonment and several botched attempts by Turkish officials to arrest him. Erdogan has arrested thousands of people for supporting Gulen since the failed 2016 coup against him; Erdogan claims Gulen orchestrated the coup, though he has provided no evidence to support the claim and the elderly Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, denies any involvement.\n\nBetween 100-200 people organized in Wan Chai for an impromptu basketball session against James, carrying a poster with their unofficial slogan, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.\u201d\n\nThe man who coined the term, Edward Leung, is currently appealing a six-year prison sentence for \u201crioting,\u201d the crime Hong Kong police typically accuse peaceful pro-democracy protesters of committing to get them off the street.\n\nA hundred of protesters are gathering at Wanchai\u2019s Southorn Playground tonight 10/15 to support Daryl Morey and Enes Kanter.

Now you come off a speech like that, we are very angry. People start burning his jersey \u2026 just because of his speech,\u201d Lo said. \u201cStudents, they come out like every weekend. They\u2019ve got tear-gassed and then they got gun-shot, like every weekend. Police beating students and then innocent people, like every day. And then (James) just comes up with something (like) that. We just can\u2019t accept that.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event in Wan Chai, another protester urged NBA players to \u201cremember \u2026 what you said before: \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019 Hong Kong lives also matter!\u201d\n\nMillions of people in Hong Kong have participated in protests against the Communist Party in the city since June, initially demanding their lawmakers withdraw a bill that would allow Beijing to extradite anyone present in Hong Kong for any reason, thereby making communist law applicable, illegally, on Hong Kong soil. Chief Executive Carrie Lam has since claimed she would urge the Legislative Council to withdraw the bill, but it has yet to officially do so.\n\nThe protesters have issued five demands, including the withdrawal of the extradition bill. The other four are the right to directly elect all lawmakers, freedom for political prisoners, and independent probe into police brutality, and an end to the government calling them rioters.\n\nIn exchange for their demands, Hong Kong police have violently assaulted them, including shooting live rounds at protesters. White-clad pro-China mobs have also taken the streets to attack unarmed protesters on behalf of Beijing.\n\nLeBron James waded into this controversy on the side of the Communist Party Monday after arriving from a tour of China. The NBA entered the fray after Morey posted a tweet reading simply, \u201cfight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself,\u201d James said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl, with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\u201d\n\nHe later added on Twitter that he was not addressing the \u201csubstance\u201d of the Hong Kong protesters\u2019 demands, but only that he had a personal stake in a friendly relationship with China and that Morey should have taken that into account when professing his pro-democratic values, which are at odds\u2019 with James\u2019.\n\nJames has deep financial ties to companies making millions in China, including Nike, with which he signed a lifetime contract. He also transferred to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of his intentions to make a claim in Hollywood, which now screens all movies for content that may be objectionable to the Communist Party.\n\nChina\u2019s English-language state media, which last week was celebrating the September 11 attacks as a slight against Morey, have now gone largely silent on the NBA. On Monday, the Global Times propaganda outlet urged Chinese people not to blame NBA players for what Morey tweeted.\n\n\u201cThe stars have done nothing wrong and they should not pay for the wrongs of their colleague or boss,\u201d the government publication wrote.", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong took to a basketball court in the Wanchai neighborhood Tuesday night to support Daryl Morey.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/nba-basketball-in-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
