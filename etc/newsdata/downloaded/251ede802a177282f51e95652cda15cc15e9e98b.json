The allegedly pro-military right knows that it cannot attack Mattis by accusing him of being unpatriotic. It also knows that it cannot call him \u201clow energy\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d because he is a retired four-star general with a reputation for toughness, which they celebrated for several years.\n\nThat\u2019s not the whole story about his recent promotions of Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead. Mattis is also \u201cdisloyal\u201d to the president in part because he put the best interest of the country over those of Donald Trump. But the right has not struggled with criticizing others who have defected\u2014Rex Tillerson, Anthony Scaramucci, etc.\u2014because they were not lifelong public servants and popular retired generals.\n\nOn the lunatic end of the left, some are attacking Mattis for agreeing to serve under Donald Trump. Apparently, five decades serving the country\u2014often risking his life\u2014is an insufficient display of his love for his country and doesn\u2019t win him the benefit of the doubt. Risking a stellar career and reputation to save the country from an unhinged commander in chief is now selfish and unpatriotic.", "description": "", "authors": ["Shay Khatiri", "Thebulwark.Com Why-James-Mattis-Deserves-Praise-Not-Scorn"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
