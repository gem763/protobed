Abe pledged to do the utmost for the safety and rescue of those missing or those who had to evacuate. \"We put the people's lives first,\" he said.\n\nWhile central Tokyo was nearly back to normal and people were able to start cleaning up in places where floodwaters subsided, hard-hit areas like Nagano, Fukushima were still inundated. Abe said there are concerns of lasting effects in the storm-hit areas and pledged speedy support for residents.\n\nCBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio said parts of Nagano, a city that once hosted the Winter Olympics were in ruin; the river that runs through the city breached its levee, destroying homes, flipping cars and toppling power lines.\n\nPolice officers search an area by boat that was flooded by Typhoon Hagibis on October 14, 2019 in Marumori, Miyagi, Japan.

His house seemed like an unlivable, muddy mess. Doors were knocked out, his handmade furniture tossed around and damaged, and everything from a futon to electronics was covered with dirt and broken.\n\n\"I put a lot of effort in this house. I made all the furniture with my wife. Now look what happened in one day,\" he said, with his voice trembling with emotion. \"Now this makes me want to cry.\"\n\nAt least some of his memorable photos with his family and relatives were intact, along with toys and games that his younger relatives played when they gathered at his house.\n\n\"I'm glad they survived at least,\" said his nephew Kazuki Yoshimura. \"Perhaps we can still do something about the house, but nothing can be more precious than life.\"\n\nA man pushes his bike past an upturned car in a road that was flooded during Typhoon Hagibis, October 14, 2019 in Nagano, Japan. Getty\n\nHagibis hit Japan's main island on Saturday with strong winds and historic rainfall that caused more than 200 rivers to overflow, leaving thousands of homes flooded, damaged or without power. Rescue crews on Tuesday were still searching for those missing, thought to number about 20.\n\nSome 34,000 homes were without power and 110,000 lacked running water. More than 30,000 people were still at shelters as of late Monday, according to the Cabinet Office's latest tally.\n\nAbe said the government is funding the disaster response from the 500-billion yen ($4.6 billion) special reserve from the fiscal 2019 budget and may additionally compile a supplementary budget if needed.\n\nHi-tech trains crippled\n\nWest Japan Railway Co. said its Hokuriku Shinkansen bullet train services connecting Tokyo and Kanazawa in the central north were reduced because of flooding of six trains at its railyard in Nagano. The trains sat in a pool of muddy water that was up to their windows.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the site of the railyard, which sits in an area noted on a prefectural hazard map as a flood area. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the operator's preparedness should be investigated later but the priority is to get the trains out of the water. Some water has been pumped out, but more than half of the railyard was still underwater.\n\nThis aerial view shows the flooded depot with shinkansen bullet trains in Nagano, Nagano prefecture on October 13, 2019, one day after Typhoon Hagibis swept through central and eastern Japan. Getty\n\nNothing spoke more of the powerlessness of modernization against natural disasters than the rows of bullet trains deluged in Nagano, a mountainous region to the northwest of Tokyo. The scene highlighted how Japan's technological prowess and meticulous attention to detail may be no match for the rising risks in a precarious era of climate change.\n\n\"Weather conditions in Japan up to now have been relatively moderate,\" said Toshitaka Katada, a disaster expert and professor at the University of Tokyo.\n\nThose days are over, and Japan's readiness for disasters, still based on data collected decades ago, hasn't kept up with the times, he said.\n\n\"Damage gets multiplied when people are overly confident about their safety,\" Katada said.\n\nWith increasingly extreme weather, he said the government, businesses and individuals need to rethink their preparedness.", "description": "Official death toll nears 60, with about 20 people still listed missing and 34,000 homes without power", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/15/5a25e91a-dc7e-4a11-b34d-ed4c00b626b6/thumbnail/1200x630/251d02237fcd0ebe27fd2da3cfa8ee38/japan-typhoon-1180973358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
