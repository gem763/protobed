A Florida Senate official is recommending that the sheriff, suspended over his handling of shootings at a Parkland high school and the Fort Lauderdale airport, should be reinstated. (Brynn Anderson/AP)\n\nIn the wake of a mass shooting last year that killed 17 in Parkland, Fla., parents and politicians roundly slammed the local sheriff, Scott Israel, for his officers\u2019 response to the tragedy.\n\nAfter a state report described the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office as having an \u201cinadequate active assailant response policy\u201d and said a sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to the school had an \u201cabysmal response,\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) suspended Israel from his post as Broward County sheriff in January.\n\nAlmost nine months later, though, an independent arbitrator has now said that Israel should be reinstated \u2014 in a major rebuke to DeSantis that drew an almost immediate reaction from the families of shooting victims.\n\nFred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed during the Parkland shooting, said he couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cHe failed before that day, he failed during that day, and he clearly failed after that day,\u201d Guttenberg told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. \u201cThe idea he would even have a chance of stepping back into that seat is mind-boggling.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff, though, said the ruling substantiates his insistence that he\u2019s not at fault.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very humbled and very grateful to God for what happened today,\u201d Israel said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lifetime in law enforcement. I just want to get back to doing what I was elected to do.\u201d\n\nThe fight over Israel\u2019s future has reopened deep wounds in South Florida over a mass shooting that sparked a national movement toward gun control.\n\nWhether he gets to return, however, is now up to the Florida Senate. The chamber will hear from the arbitrator, lawyer Dudley Goodlette, in October and then decide if it should bring Israel back to his post atop the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office or permanently remove him from office.\n\nIsrael, a Democrat first elected in 2012, had previously come under scrutiny for his office\u2019s handling of a deadly 2017 shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, when a passenger drew a gun from his luggage and began shooting randomly, killing five and wounding another six. That shooting, and the chaos that ensued, could have been avoided with better training, the governor said.\n\nLess than a year later, a shooter opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, killing 17, as the deputy assigned to protect the school took cover away from the site of the shooting \u2014 and told other officers to keep away. A state commission later found \u201cdeep fault\u201d with the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office, charging that deputies failed to engage the shooter or see the warning signs that he might attack.\n\nAs Israel emerged as a fierce advocate for gun control in the wake of the Parkland shooting, he also took on the task of defending himself: He praised his \u201camazing leadership\u201d during the shooting \u2014 but also charged he was not responsible for the actions of individual deputies.\n\n[Florida massacre: Broward Sheriff Scott Israel\u2019s plea for gun control]\n\nDeSantis had said while campaigning for governor in 2018 that Israel should be fired. Three days into office, flanked by relatives of Parkland victims, he delivered on his promise. Israel had \u201cegregiously failed,\u201d the newly elected governor said, blaming him for inadequate training and shoddy management.\n\nIsrael appealed to the state Senate, which appointed Goodlette.\n\nIn a 34-page report made public on Wednesday, the arbiter found the Stoneman Douglas shooting was a \u201cculmination of individual failures,\u201d and there was not enough evidence to fully prove DeSantis\u2019s claims of \u201cneglect of duty\u201d and \u201cincompetence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheriff Israel and the BSO are not blameless for the tragedy at Stoneman Douglas,\u201d Goodlette wrote. \u201cThat said, the evidence offered has not demonstrated that Sheriff Israel should be removed from office based on this incident.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s active shooter policy, which did not mandate directly engaging with shooters, was not outside the norm for other Florida law enforcement agencies at the time, he said. Outside Broward County, other sheriffs had implemented similar training schedules.\n\nMoreover, he wrote, permanently firing Israel would create an \u201cunworkable precedent\u201d that would allow the governor to remove anyone from office.\n\nHis report was quickly skewered by victims\u2019 relatives.\n\n\u201cI feel like someone just punched me in the stomach,\u201d said Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed in the 2018 shooting.\n\nAnd Andrew Pollack, a strong DeSantis supporter whose daughter Meadow was also killed, wrote on Twitter that DeSantis \u201cdid the righteous thing firing the totally incompetent Scott Israel.\u201d\n\nThe suspended sheriff \u201clet kids get murdered,\u201d Pollack said, and then lied about it.\n\nIn a statement to the Sun-Sentinel, DeSantis said he disagreed with Goodlette\u2019s report \u2014 and hopes that the state Senate does too.\n\n\u201cThe victims with families impacted by the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School deserve justice and accountability,\u201d DeSantis said, later adding: \u201cFloridians were appalled by Scott Israel\u2019s repeated failures.\u201d\n\nIsrael, however, who maintains that he has been scapegoated by the governor, said in a statement to the Palm Beach Post that \u201cthe rule of law has prevailed.\u201d\n\nRegardless of what the Florida Senate decides, the saga is not over yet. Both Israel, and Gregory Tony, the sheriff DeSantis picked to replace him, are expected to run for Broward County sheriff next year.", "description": "Florida Gov.
