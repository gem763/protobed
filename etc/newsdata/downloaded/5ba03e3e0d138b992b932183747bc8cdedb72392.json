PA/Bali Boo/Amazon\n\nWe clearly have a long way to go, but progress is slowly being made. Here\u2019s what coffee chains in the UK are doing to combat plastic pollution now.\n\nPret A Manger\n\nThe popular sandwich and coffee chain offers 50p off the price of their hot drinks to customers who use bring their own disposable cups, making it one of the highest discounts around.\n\nOn its website, the company outlines its global plastic pledge, which states that by 2025 it aims to make all of its packaging 100 per cent recyclable, reusable or compostable.\n\nIt has also promised to eliminate all unnecessary single-use plastic and help customers recycle in its stores within this time frame.\n\nCosta Coffee\n\nThe UK\u2019s largest coffee shop company has promised to recycle as many cups as it sells by 2020, which would surmount to roughly half a billion coffee cups a year.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal, Costa has partnered with an independent waste management service company called Valpak.\n\nThe company also offers a 25p discount to customers who bring in a reusable cup.\n\nBoston Tea Party\n\nThe independent Bristol-based coffee chain introduced a ban on disposable coffee cups in April 2018.\n\nCustomers must either bring a reusable cup, drink their coffee inside or pay a deposit on a cup they then have to return to any branch.\n\nBut Boston Tea Party\u2019s sustainable ambitions have had economic consequences.\n\nOwner Sam Roberts recently announced that the company\u2019s takeaway coffee sales had fallen by 25 per cent since imposing the ban. But Roberts has insisted that despite losing what equates to roughly \u00a3250,000 in sales, the ban still stands.\n\nAMT Coffee\n\nIn November last year, the coffee chain announced the launch of 100 per cent bio-compostable coffee cups made from sugar cane crop.\n\nThe chain, which has more than 50 stores in UK train stations, launched the cups ahead of the festive period, with each bearing the slogan \u201cLet\u2019s make the change\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is by far the greenest and best alternative to the traditional plastic-lined cup and plastic lid, served by many other coffee retailers which take decades to break down,\u201d reads a statement on the company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cThe revolutionary technology will help tackle an estimated 2.5 billion coffee cups sent to waste every year and will help save countless amounts of trees.\u201d\n\nStarbucks\n\nThe American coffee company offers UK customers a 25p discount on hot drinks if they bring their own reusable cup.\n\nAs of July 2018, Starbucks has also been rolling out a 5p charge on disposable cups at stores around the UK. It\u2019s already in place at 35 London stores.\n\n\u201cThe aim was to see what impact a charge might have on customers choosing to use a reusable and reduce single-use paper cups,\u201d the company explains on its website.\n\nThe company has also teamed up with environmental-focused investment firm Closed Loop Partners to develop a more eco-friendly takeaway cup.\n\nCaffe Nero\n\nCaffe Nero has had a partnership with reusable cup company KeepCup for years, putting them on display in its stores in a bid to encourage customers to purchase one and bring it back each time they buy a coffee.\n\nThose who do will receive a bonus stamp on their loyalty cards, bringing them one step closer to earning a free coffee.\n\nIn June 2018, it expanded this to ensure that KeepCups were available in all of its stores around the UK.\n\nCaffe Nero has also replaced its plastic straws with paper straws in all of its UK coffee houses, which it claims will remove at least seven million plastic straws a year from entering UK waste streams.", "description": "Plastic pollution is becoming an increasing concern as emerging\u00a0research continues to show just how much damage it\u2019s doing to our planet.
