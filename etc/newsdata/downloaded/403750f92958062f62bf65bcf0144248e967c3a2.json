(Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nConfusion about health impacts\n\nHealth Canada says there have been no reported cases of lung illness in Canada, but issued a statement this week urging those who vape to be cautious and warning young people, pregnant women and non-smokers not to vape at all.\n\nE-cigarettes were legalized in Canada in 2018, popularized as useful tool in lowering one's cigarette or cannabis use.\n\nResearchers have expressed concerns about potential damage e-cigarettes can cause to the lungs and heart , as well as the risk of burns and seizures . However, Hammond says a patchwork of laws in Canada, particularly around the marketing of vaping products to the public, have contributed to confusion about the health impacts of e-cigarettes.\n\n\"They're almost certainly likely to be harmful but much less harmful than smoking,\" said Hammond.\n\n\"There's no reason for non-smokers to be using these products because they will increase health risks.\"\n\nHammond's research suggests vaping rates among Canadian teenagers have shot up since 2018. Teen cigarette smoking also appears to be on the rise for the first time in 30 years.\n\nHammond says health warnings on vaping products should be mandatory, and believes Health Canada should force manufacturers to list vape juice ingredients. The professor does acknowledge the challenges in regulating the vaping industry, likening it to \"grabbing the tiger by the tail,\" because it's changing so rapidly.\n\n\"The products we have on the market today are fundamentally different than the ones we had in Canada two years ago,\" said Hammond, adding that new vape devices can now deliver as much nicotine as conventional cigarettes.\n\nVaping retailer also opposed to ban\n\nAn Ontario-based retailer of vapes and vaping accessories agrees that a ban won't keep e-cigarettes out of the hands of teenagers.\n\n\"I am very confident that underground or off-grid sales of products would remain,\" said David Howard, owner of Canada Vapes in London, Ont.\n\n\"It would also reduce the ability for current smokers to be able to use product as an alternative [to cigarettes].\"\n\nHoward launched his vaping operation in 2010, after his personal use of e-cigarettes helped him kick his 20-year smoking habit.\n\nDave \u201cHowie\u201d Howard, owns Canada Vapes in London, Ont., a company he launched in 2010. He argues that vaping is a healthy alternative to cigarette-smoking. (Submitted by David Howard)\n\nStricter advertising regulations\n\nDespite his belief that e-cigarettes benefit smokers, Howard welcomes the idea of stricter vaping regulations. He suggests the increase in youth vaping can be blamed on major commercial tobacco companies, many of which now own e-cigarette companies.\n\n\"You've seen the tobacco companies in Canada starting to get into the vaping space, and they definitely have more power than 'mom-and-pop shop' people. Long-term, that is a concern \u2014 they have access to basically every variety store and every single gas station across Canada,\" he said.\n\nHammond agrees that marketing has played a significant role in the rising popularity of vaping.\n\n\"By advertising them in the corner stores next to the candy and Slurpee machine... with exploding strawberries and mangoes, they make it look fun and tasty,\" said Hammond.\n\nHoward rejects any suggestion that the vaping industry targets youth with fruit or candy flavouring, saying it's adults who want different flavoured e-liquids.\n\nE-Liquids, which are used for vaping in electronic cigarettes, are regularly marketed with bright colours. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ordered e-cigarette product makers to devise a plan to keep their devices away from minors, declaring use by teens has reached an \"epidemic proportion\". (Getty Images)\n\n\"If you only had 'no flavour' e-liquid, it would reduce the effectiveness of the product for all current smokers looking to transition to vaping,\" he said.\n\nConversely, Hammond expressed concerns around the allure of vaping to teenagers.\n\n\"We have to find a way of getting these in the hands of adult smokers who can't quit other ways, but protect kids and change the perceptions of these things as a fun, modern, sleek way of taking your drugs,\" he said.\n\nAs for current illnesses linked to lung disease sweeping across the U.S., Howard maintains he's had no health complaints from Canada Vapes clients.\n\n\"We've personally had tens of thousands of customers, and we have had zero customers ever come back. In my opinion, something significant has changed within some small subset of [e-cigarette] manufacturing,\" said Howard.\n\n\"What that is, I don't know.\"", "description": "Regardless of vaping\u2019s potential dangers, banning e-cigarettes isn\u2019t a solution, says public health professor David Hammond.
