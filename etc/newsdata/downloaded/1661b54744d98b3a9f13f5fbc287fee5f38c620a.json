Kay Ivey of Alabama resisted calls for her resignation for appearing in blackface in a skit more than a half-century ago, as President Trump signaled his general support for the Republican governor.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday in Montgomery, Ms. Ivey again apologized for her offensive sorority skit in 1967 but reiterated she has no intention of resigning.\n\n\u201cHeavens, no, I\u2019m not going to resign,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that happened 52 years ago and I\u2019m not that person. My administration stands on being inclusive and helping people.\u201d\n\nThe uproar over Ms. Ivey\u2019s actions is reminiscent of that that engulfed Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. Unlike Mr. Northam, whose medical school yearbook page featured a photo of two men, one in blackface, the other in full Ku Klux Klan regalia, no photographic evidence of Ms. Ivey\u2019s college behavior appears to exist.\n\nThe blackface skit came to light following the appearance of a radio interview Ms. Ivey had with her former husband in which the couple discussed the goings-on at the Baptist Student Union.\n\nAlthough Ms. Ivey has never denied the skit since the radio interview surfaced, she insists she has no memory of the event. Earlier this year, Ms. Ivey had told The Associated Press she had never worn blackface after a page from a yearbook showed a handful of her sorority sisters wearing blackface.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Ivey reiterated her public apology and her understanding it was a hurtful act.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t remember being at the Baptist Student Union in any kind of skit like that for sure,\u201d Ms. Ivey said Tuesday. \u201cBut I\u2019ve apologized for it. I should not have done that. I know it\u2019s important to apologize to the people of Alabama.\u201d\n\nThe Republican governor got an overall statement of support from President Trump, who praised her as \u201ca fine woman,\u201d although the president acknowledged he had no knowledge about what happened with Ms. Ivey and her sorority cohorts in the 1960s. For now, the Ivey camp appears to be adopting the same strategy Mr. Northam did in Virginia of riding out the wave of bad publicity.\n\nThe NAACP in Alabama has called for her resignation but the push for her ouster is far from universal.\n\nFor example, Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, a black Democrat, has stopped short of demanding a resignation, saying that he appreciated Ms. Ivey \u201cowning\u201d the incident and apologizing for it.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
