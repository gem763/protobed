Calamity Came Fast.", "language": "en", "text": "One day he was inviting Mr. Erdogan to visit the White House; the next he was threatening to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it crossed a line that he never defined.\n\nMr. Erdogan just kept going.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s error, some aides concede in off-the-record conversations , was entering the Oct. 6 call underprepared, and then failing to spell out for Mr. Erdogan the potential consequences \u2014 from economic sanctions to a contraction of Turkey\u2019s alliance with the United States and its standing in NATO. He has since threatened both, retroactively, and said Monday afternoon that he would soon issue an executive order imposing sanctions against \u201ccurrent and former officials\u201d of the Turkish government and \u201cany persons contributing to Turkey\u2019s destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.\u201d But it is not clear whether Mr. Erdogan believes that poses a real risk.\n\nThe drama is nowhere near over. Out of necessity, the Kurds switched sides on Sunday, turning their backs on Washington and signing up with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a man the United States has called a war criminal for gassing his own people. At the Pentagon, officials struggled with the right response if Turkish forces \u2014 NATO allies \u2014 again opened fire on any of the 1,000 or so Americans now preparing to retreat from their positions inside Syria. Those troops are trapped for now, since Turkey has cut off the roads; removing them may require an airlift.\n\nAnd over the weekend, State and Energy Department officials were quietly reviewing plans for evacuating roughly 50 tactical nuclear weapons that the United States had long stored, under American control, at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, about 250 miles from the Syrian border, according to two American officials.", "description": "All the warnings were there. But President Trump\u2019s reliance on his instincts, and his relationships, led him to ignore the consequences of a move that has emboldened Russia, Iran and the Islamic State.", "authors": ["David E.
