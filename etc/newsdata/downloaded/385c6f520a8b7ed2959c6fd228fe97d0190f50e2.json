Trump and Giuliani have been working since at least last spring to urge the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter for corruption, and to help discredit the FBI's finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 US election.\n\nRead more: The FBI's investigation of Rudy Giuliani includes a counterintelligence aspect that suggests he may be a national security threat\n\nAt the heart of those efforts is a July 25 phone call during which Trump repeatedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accede to his demands. Days before the call, Trump held up a nearly $400 million military-aid package to Ukraine. During their conversation, Trump reminded Zelensky that \"we do a lot for Ukraine,\" and followed up by asking Zelensky to \"do us a favor, though,\" and investigate Biden and the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nSondland and Volker were instrumental in conveying Trump's demands to Zelensky both before and after the phone call.\n\nIn addition to establishing a channel of communication between Giuliani and senior Ukrainian government officials, Volker and Sondland also furthered the impression that a good relationship between Trump and Zelensky \u2014 and a White House meeting between the two \u2014 was conditioned on Zelensky helping the US president's political agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, Sondland will tell lawmakers he was \"disappointed by the president's direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani.\"\n\nHe will also testify that despite being disappointed, he got in touch with Giuliani at Trump's direction anyway, and that Giuliani indicated that a White House visit for Zelensky was predicated on Ukraine investigating Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company whose board Hunter Biden sat on, and the Russia probe.\n\nRead more: Trump's presidency is disintegrating as he faces his worst 30 days since taking office\n\nSondland will testify that \"Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election (including the DNC server) and Burisma as two anti-corruption investigatory topics of importance for the president,\" according to his opening statement.", "description": "Sondland's role in Ukraine policy has puzzled US officials because as the ambassador to the EU, he shouldn't have been involved in the first place.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da2fd0b4af90938d97e3b42?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
