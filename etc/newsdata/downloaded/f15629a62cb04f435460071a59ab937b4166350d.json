One home reporter interrupted Southgate's press conference to say the racism wasn't as bad as is being claimed. A Bulgarian cameraman also told Southgate to f*** off at the end. Drag yourselves into the 21st century guys.\"\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nAnother journalist, Miguel Delaney , added: \"Same journalist then interrupts Southgate. 'This is a complete exaggeration. What difficult circumstances. The game was so friendly.'\"\n\nThe likes of Southgate and FA chairman Greg Clarke have urged UEFA to throw the book at Bulgaria after such an unsavoury night, but the Bulgaria manager Krasimir Balakov claimed he hadn't heard any abuse.\n\n\"I personally did not hear the chanting you are most probably referring to,\" Balakov said. \"I saw that the referee stopped the game.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"To be honest this has not happened to us before. The disciplinary measures by UEFA were not because of racist chanting but because of a banner from an organisation which is not forbidden by Bulgarian law.\n\n\"If this turns out to be true, we are truly sorry. The Bulgaria national team and the Bulgaria football union are working very hard and no one wants to see this.\n\n\"But let me tell you this really has never happened before in our games up until now.\"", "description": "The England manager was reportedly abused by a cameraman at his post-match press conference following the disgraceful scenes during the game", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581321.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
