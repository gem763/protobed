But only if they are allowed to skip school. Earlier this week the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, urged schools to consider as \u201cjustified\u201d the absence of children taking part in the mobilisation against the climate emergency.\n\nHe said on Facebook the climate strike was \u201cessential\u201d for students\u2019 future, which was \u201cthreatened by environmental devastation and an unsustainable economic growth model\u201d.\n\nHowever, many schools are only obliging after receiving a letter requesting permission from parents and if the child has maintained good attendance throughout the year.\n\nDavid Wicker, a representative of the Turin branch of Fridays for Future Italia, is planning to miss school regardless. Despite the high expected turnout, he worries that environmental issues are not yet a major concern for children and adults alike.\n\n\u201cI would urge adults to join the movement too,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, it is not recognised as an official strike by labour unions. One day off work won\u2019t change your career but it will change your future.\u201d\n\nIt comes as world leaders wrap up the UN climate action summit in New York. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, urged his counterparts against \u201cindifference\u201d as news emerged that a massive portion of a Mont Blanc glacier was in danger of collapse. \u201cIt must shake us all and force us to mobilise,\u201d he said.\n\nConte promised to make environmental action a priority in a speech before the new left-leaning government, a coalition of the Five Star Movement (M5S) and Democratic party, was voted into power earlier this month. Although M5S had long prioritised the environment in its campaigning, the subject appeared to take a backseat during the party\u2019s 14-month coalition with the far-right League.\n\nSergio Costa, an M5S politician who kept his role as environment minister in the new alliance, has been more proactive, saying in New York this week that \u201ccourageous and revolutionary\u201d policies were needed. The ministry is drafting a range of measures, including giving shoppers a 20% discount on supermarket goods that are sold loose in an attempt to cut back on plastic waste. Some 2.2m tonnes of plastic wrapping is discarded in Italy each year and in 2016 less than half of that was recycled, according to WWF figures.\n\nPollution is also a major issue, especially in Italy\u2019s northern cities. And while Italy\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing over the past decade, the country was criticised this year by the European Climate Foundation for failing to provide an adequate plan to further reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe hope the new government recognises the climate emergency and declares it so at the summit,\u201d said Wicker. \u201cWe want them to divest in fossil fuels and invest in green energy resources, while improving public transport and make it more affordable.\u201d\n\nThe biggest climate strike in history took place last Friday, with several million people across an estimated 185 countries taking part. More than 2,400 separate strikes are expected globally on Friday, according to the group Fridays For Future. As well as Italy, especially large turnouts are expected in India, New Zealand, Sweden and the US.", "description": "Education minister from new coalition says schools should see absences as \u2018justified\u2019", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/130d9bab9d99d553a632606ffa3d1530f2b90166/47_179_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=80adc91673b5a9b7c756c3a2be51f0bc", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
