'Clive, what was the score?' he said, smiling. He dragged me away and into our dressing room.\"\n\nAllen goes on to say: \"I wouldn\u2019t give him the time of day as long as I live. It is not about football, it is the way he behaved.\"", "description": "Former Spurs coach says he was 'ready to punch' legendary Gunners boss after long-running feud", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1733589.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Clive%20Allen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
