He is a doubt for Arsenal. That\u2019s just the way it is,\u201d Solskjaer told a news conference on Friday.\n\nSolskjaer confirmed Anthony Martial (thigh) and Marcus Rashford (groin) are unlikely to return on Monday, but left-back Luke Shaw has returned to first-team training.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put my life on Rashford and Martial being fit, that\u2019s part of this game - you work with what you have,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\n\u201cLuke Shaw is back in training today, he is getting there, so let\u2019s see how he reacts in the next couple of days.\u201d\n\nThe injury crisis could leave United\u2019s 17-year-old Mason Greenwood as their only recognised striker for the match at Old Trafford.\n\nGreenwood, who is yet to start in the Premier League this season, has scored in his last two appearances against Rochdale in the League Cup and Astana in the Europa League, and Solskjaer could continue to put his faith in the youngster.\n\n\u201cHe (Greenwood) has proved when he gets in the box he is dangerous,\u201d the United manager said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s proved in those games he\u2019s ready for it, the Premier League. I\u2019ll have the weekend to think about it.\u201d\n\nUnited are unbeaten in their last 12 league matches against Arsenal at Old Trafford but have lost three of their last six home matches in the league.", "description": "Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba faces a race against time to prove his fitness for Monday's Premier League clash against Arsenal after an ankle injury flared up, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
