Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Andrew Yang are the most popular Democratic candidates on the Drudge Report\u2019s online poll asking who won Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate.\n\nGabbard led the field of candidates with just under 40 percent of the vote shortly before midnight. The poll showed Yang in second place with 20 percent of the vote, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg with eight percent of the vote. Buttigieg attempted to target Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during the debate, particularly for failing to explicitly state whether she would raise taxes on the middle class in order to pay for Medicare for All.\n\nWarren came in fourth place, right behind Buttigieg, with seven percent support, despite having more speaking time (roughly 23 minutes) than any other candidate:\n\nElizabeth Warren spoke the most during tonight's debate, with 23.1 minutes. Joe Biden, who leads in speaking time across the three previous debates, got 16.6 minutes. The rest of the field follows, with between 7.2 and 13.2 minutes of air-time. https://t.co/f8GyyhyVVn pic.twitter.com/EgzGFqhpHq \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 16, 2019\n\nThe Drudge Poll \u2014 framed with the simple question \u201cWHO WON THE SIXTH DEM DEBATE\u201d \u2014 is not scientific in its methodology and does not prevent multiple votes from respondents. However, as with the 2016 Republican primary, its results often indicate genuine enthusiasm from a candidate\u2019s fan base. Corporate media and establishment pundits mocked then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s consistent Drudge Poll dominance, but those results ultimately matched the results of the race.\n\nTuesday\u2019s poll shows many of the candidates separated by less than one percentage point.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MA) came in right behind Warren with 6.45 percent support, followed by Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tom Steyer, Beto O\u2019Rourke, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with 6.1 percent, 3.69 percent, 3.33 percent, 2.06 percent, and 1.25 percent, respectively.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who desperately needed a breakout moment, came in second to last with 1.2 percent support. Juli\u00e1n Castro failed to top one percent as of midnight.\n\nBreitbart News\u2019s own online poll also showed Gabbard as the overwhelming winner of Tuesday evening\u2019s debate, earning 62 percent of the vote as of midnight.", "description": "Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang are the most popular Democratic candidates on the Drudge Report's online poll asking who won Tuesday's debate.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/tulsi-gabbard-andrew-yang-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
