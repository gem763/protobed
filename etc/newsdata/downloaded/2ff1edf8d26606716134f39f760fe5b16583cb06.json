Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) health and age during a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back Rally\u201d in New York City on Saturday, declaring that he is \u201cglad\u201d that Sanders is 78 years old and arguing that he would rather \u201ctalk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying\u201d than Sanders\u2019 heart attack.\n\nThe Sicko director dismissed concerns over Sanders\u2019 age \u2014 he would be the oldest president to take office if elected \u2014 and argued that he is \u201cglad\u201d that Sanders is 78-years-old.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s 78, and we will benefit for his wisdom and his experience and his knowledge and his love for the American people,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for President of the United States. You know why that\u2019s a gift?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has a 78 year old seen? Bernie has seen many of the things we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d the filmmaker said, naming pay raises, pensions, and the defeat of fascism and white supremacy.\n\nThe Oscar-winner also added that it is the Electoral College \u2014 not Sanders \u2014 that is old and outdated.\n\nFrom there, Michael Moore pivoted to Sanders\u2019 heart attack and dismissed all concerns related to the socialist senator\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cNext thing they say,\u201d Moore began \u2014 \u201cthey\u201d being those who tout \u201cfalse\u201d narratives\u201d about Sanders \u2014 \u201cis what about his health?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying. That\u2019s the health I care about,\u201d Moore said before joining the crowd in chanting, \u201cGreen New Deal!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the health of the kids in Flint, Michigan,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cWhat about their health? Talk about that on cable news. What about the health of 40 million people who live in poverty?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only heart attack we should be talking about is the one Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is President of the United States,\u201d he said.", "description": "Michael Moore praised Bernie Sanders' age and added that we should \"talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/michaelmoorebernierally1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
