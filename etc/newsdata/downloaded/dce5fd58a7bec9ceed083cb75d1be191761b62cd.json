(Picture: Rex/Getty)\n\nCheryl dared to bare on the red carpet on Wednesday night as she enjoyed a rare night off from parenting duties to attend the Attitude Awards at Camden\u2019s Roundhouse.\n\nShowing her support for the LGBTQ+ community at the event hosted by the UK\u2019s best-selling gay magazine, the 36-year-old showed off her phenomenal figure (can we just remind everyone she had a baby a mere two years ago?) in a gold plunging mini dress that highlighted her tiny, rarely seen cleavage tattoo.\n\nThe frock\u2019s intricate design featured thousands of gold sequins in vertical stripes, with an added velvet buckle detailing around the neck that tied in her thigh-high black boots.\n\nIf anyone can rock a look like this, it\u2019s gotta be Cheryl.\n\nWearing her light coloured hair in loose waves, our Chez paired her look with gold eye makeup, a nude lip and stunning peachy coloured blush we\u2019re determined to replicate at home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe star was joined by a number of stars from the LGBTQ+ community and their allies, including Taron Egerton, Joan Collins and rising star Ava Max.\n\nWe\u2019re loving the light hair!

Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, we have to say our eyes were particularly drawn to former Attitude cover stars McFly, with the recently reformed boyband looking insanely dapper in their formal wear.\n\nWith music provided by DJ extraordinaire Jodie Harsh, drag was present throughout the event, with 19-year-old RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK star Scaredy Cat appearing with his girlfriend Pussy Cat, while Freddie Flintoff made a beeline for the Virgin Atlantic drag queen crew.\n\nMaybe someone should tell him they\u2019re not actual flight attendants\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
