The consortium of attorneys general is trying to determine if Facebook endangered consumer protection and limited consumer choice. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the FTC was looking into Facebook\u2019s acquisitions.\n\nOver the last 15 years, Facebook has acquired about 90 companies including WhatsApp and Instagram. And despite the increased scrutiny on its competitive practices, it\u2019s shown no sign of slowing down with its mission to gobble up everything in sight. Just this week, the social networking behemoth purchased a CTRL-Labs, a startup focused on brain-reading technology, for somewhere between $740 million and $1.5 billion.\n\nThe anonymous source told Bloomberg that the Justice Department is looking into different conduct than what the FTC is investigating. When the FTC fined Facebook in July, the company\u2019s stock saw a 1.8 per cent boost. Perhaps one of the other investigations will actually help consumers more than Facebook.", "description": "The U.S. Justice Department is reportedly planning on joining the growing cluster of agencies investigating Facebook for antitrust violations....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Catie Keck"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ztxehmbqzha4lebbakqe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
