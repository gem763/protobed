It's not just the plot of some sci-fi movie. It's a real-life threat, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe FDA is warning patients, medical providers and hospitals that software vulnerabilities in some medical devices might allow a hacker to take control of items that connect to wireless networks -- think pacemakers and infusion pumps -- or find a back door into entire hospital networks.\n\n\"These cybersecurity vulnerabilities may allow a remote user to take control of a medical device and change its function, cause denial of service, or cause information leaks or logical flaws, which may prevent a device from functioning properly or at all,\" according to a statement from the agency.\n\nThe FDA identified 11 cybersecurity holes in operating systems that run third-party software called IPnet, which computers use to communicate with each other.
