The Premier League\u2019s great rivalries have been characterised by spats between managers or titanic battles between players but the ugliest part of the war between Anfield and the Etihad is behind the scenes.\n\nThe news last week that Liverpool paid their adversaries \u00a31million without any admission of wrongdoing after legal complaints that the Merseyside club were hacking into City\u2019s scouting database between June 2012 and February the next year underlines the point. Recruitment is one of the fault lines in the relationship between the top flight\u2019s best two teams.\n\nIt is not just at the big-money end of the market for players.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

City were miffed enough to put the pair on gardening leave until the summer transfer window of 2012 shut. It was during this time that someone logged in to City\u2019s Scout7 system.\n\nMany clubs use the programme and there are stringent protocols that allow different levels of authority. It is unlikely anyone would have been able to gain access to the work of the senior stratums of City\u2019s hierarchy. It appears that someone at Anfield was stupid and unprofessional. Nevertheless, Liverpool are probably lucky that City did not make more of the issue at the time. They had good reason to complain.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Right from the start John W Henry, the principal owner, played down financial expectations by saying, \"I do not have Sheikh in front of my name.\"\n\nThe Boston-based businessman hoped Financial Fair Play rules would create fiscal parity but said if that failed he would get \u201ca Sheikh of our own.\u201d In each case Henry could have talked about oligarchs but the use of the Arab honorific indicated his fixation with City.\n\nAt schoolboy level, Liverpool have been concerned that some of the best young prospects are having their heads turned with cash. There has been a perception \u2013 real or otherwise \u2013 that City\u2019s spending power creates a massive advantage in this area. It can be a murky world but few Premier League teams have any right to claim the high moral ground. Invariably clubs are blind to their own transgressions and keen to point out the offences of others.\n\nAfter the takeover by Sheikh Mansour, City were playing catch-up with the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United across the board. They had to outgun the big spenders and no one likes it when their power is challenged. Liverpool liked it less. There was a large amount of hypocrisy and envy at play. No one at Anfield was complaining when they poached Raheem Sterling from Queens Park Rangers.\n\nThese days City do not have to overpay. Young players want to go to the Etihad. Over the past few years the club have had agreements with United and Chelsea not to get into bidding wars for young talent.\n\nYet it is clear that City got into Liverpool\u2019s head and remain there. When there were suggestions towards the end of Roberto Mancini\u2019s tenure in charge at the Etihad that Brendan Rodgers was on the potential list of replacements, FSG inserted a \u00a320million buyout clause into the Northern Irishman\u2019s contract.\n\nThe champions have spent a lot of money but they worked to a plan. That was not always evident at Anfield, even in the early years of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s time on Merseyside.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s sometimes holier-than-thou attitude caused irritation at the Etihad but City\u2019s main cause of angst at the moment is a belief that Klopp\u2019s team get the run of the ball. The feeling in Manchester is that the champions of Europe are the luckiest team on the continent. That is a complement in many ways. City recognise their main danger. The feeling is mutual.\n\nHenry was right when he arrived in English football. He saw that the club being rebuilt in east Manchester was going to dominate the Premier League. That was obvious and so is the reality that City will try to sign the best players and will pay what they need to to get their men. No one needed to hack a scouting system to know that.", "description": "The animosity between Liverpool\u00a0and Manchester City on the pitch reflects only a fraction of the antipathy that exists in their boardrooms.
