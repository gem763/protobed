A majority, 56 percent, disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president, while 6 percent have no opinion.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAmericans\u2019 opinions on Trump\u2019s stewardship of the economy, which his campaign plans to emphasize to voters as he battles for a second term, have also diminished, according to the survey.\n\nLess than half of respondents, 46 percent, approve of the way the president is handling the economy, a decrease from 51 percent approval in midsummer. Fewer of those polled, 35 percent, approve of the way the president is handling trade negotiations with China, and 60 percent worry the trade conflict between the two countries will raise the price of goods for their families.\n\nTrump has moved to intensify the tariff dispute with Beijing in recent weeks, announcing fresh hikes to duties on Chinese imports. The escalation in the trade war, along with the president\u2019s consistent attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have played out as U.S. financial indicators have warned of a potential economic downturn or recession.\n\nMore than half of Americans, 60 percent, believe a recession is likely to occur in 2020, according to the survey, and 43 percent said Trump\u2019s trade and economic policies have increased the chance of such a crisis.\n\nOnly 16 percent of respondents believe Trump\u2019s policies have decreased the odds of a recession, while 34 percent said they have made no difference and 7 percent have no opinion.\n\nThe majority of respondents still hold a positive view of the state of the economy, 56-43 percent, with 40 percent believing it is in \u201cgood\u201d condition and 16 percent describing it as \u201cexcellent.\u201d But those numbers represent a decrease from a 65 percent positive assessment last fall.\n\nTrump pushed back against the results of the survey Tuesday morning in a perplexing tweet that hit at ABC and the Post, and he claimed his lawyers were able to force changes in past polls.\n\n\"ABC/Washington Post Poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 Election,\" he wrote . \"When my lawyers protested, they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day. It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. Sad!\"\n\nA few minutes later, he sent another tweet railing against public polling and extolling his campaign's surveys.\n\n\"One of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out,\" he wrote. \"Many of these polls are fixed, or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. Internal polling looks great, the best ever!\"\n\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted Sept. 2-5, surveying a random national sample of 1,003 adults in English and Spanish via telephone. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.", "description": "More than half of Americans believe a recession is likely to occur in 2020, according to the survey.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f8/2e/d97e640f420095f445f7a55f013e/190910-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
