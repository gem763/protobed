The Trump administration reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran in the fall.\n\nIran has said it will reduce its commitments under the agreement every 60 days until Europe negotiates improved economic terms and offsets the effects of the U.S. sanctions.\n\nAD\n\nIn July, Iran breached the pact\u2019s limits on its stockpile of enriched uranium and exceeded a cap on enrichment levels, raising them from 3.67 percent to 4.5 percent. (Weapons-grade uranium is enriched to about a 90 percent concentration of uranium 235, a fissile isotope.)\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, Rouhani gave European nations a new 60-day deadline to salvage the deal.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has recently spearheaded an effort to offer Iran a bailout package in exchange for its full compliance with the nuclear agreement, diplomats said.\n\nThe offer includes a $15 billion line of credit to compensate for lost oil revenue but would depend on a guarantee from the Trump administration not to block the money.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur return to the full implementation of the nuclear accord is subject to the receipt of $15 billion over a four-month period, otherwise the process of reducing Iran\u2019s commitments will continue,\u201d Iranian state television quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi as saying Wednesday.\n\n\u201cEither Europe has to buy oil from Iran or provide Iran with the equivalent of selling oil as a credit line guaranteed by Iran\u2019s oil revenue,\u201d Araghchi said.\n\nAD\n\nAs part of the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran agreed to significant restrictions on its atomic energy program in return for widespread sanctions relief.\n\nThe accord states that Iran agrees to \u201ccertain limitations on specific research and development (R&D) activities for the first 8 years,\u201d after which it will gradually move to the next stage of its enrichment activities. It also says that Iran will \u201ccontinue to conduct enrichment R&D in a manner that does not accumulate enriched uranium.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOpinion: Like it or not, talks with Iran are coming soon\n\nThe announcement Wednesday could raise tensions with the United States, which has pushed a \u201cmaximum-pressure campaign\u201d that it says will persuade Iran to strike a grand bargain on issues such as its nuclear program, ballistic missiles and support for proxy forces in the region.\n\nRouhani this week ruled out any bilateral discussions with the Trump administration, saying Iran would talk to the U.S. government only as part of multilateral negotiations after all sanctions have been lifted and the Trump administration returns to the nuclear deal.\n\nAD\n\nAlso Wednesday, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister said Iran had released seven crew members from the Stena Impero oil tanker it has held since July. Iranian naval forces intercepted the British-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nAD\n\nSixteen more members of the crew would remain aboard, a statement from Stena Bulk, which owns the tanker, said, to satisfy a regulation requiring a minimum number of crew members to safely operate the vessel.\n\nEnvironmentalists filmed Iran\u2019s vanishing cheetahs. Now they could be executed for spying.\n\nBoth allies and enemies will stand in the way of Trump talking to Rouhani\n\nU.S. voices support for Israel as war fears rise in the Middle East\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "France is leading a push by European nations to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal as Iran steps up the pressure.", "authors": ["Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KIxV2YEEt2UuDaMoMBIpeUnHg0E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DPLFA3WPCII6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
