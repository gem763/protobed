However, in this app's case, media is also removed from storage at the same time.\n\nCNET: Mozilla tests Firefox VPN service to help protect your privacy\n\nIn one-on-one chats, Telegram's privacy failure might not be the end of the world, but in 'supergroup' chat sessions that can contain thousands of active members, the implications may be more serious -- especially if a user sends a sensitive image or two by accident.\n\n\"Assume a case wherein you're a part of a group with 2,000,00 members and you accidentally share a media file not meant to be shared in that particular group and proceed to delete by checking \"delete for all members\" present in the group,\" Mishra notes. \"You're relying on a functionality that is broken since your file would still be present in storage for all users.\"\n\nMishra verified the validity of the bug in Telegram for Android version 5.10.0 (1684) and it is possible the problem also impacted Telegram for Windows and iOS, but tests were not performed.\n\nAfter submitting his findings to Telegram, the messaging service accepted the research and accompanying proof-of-concept (PoC). A fix has been included in the latest version of Telegram, version 5.11.\n\nMishra was awarded \u20ac2,500 ($2,749) for the report.\n\nTechRepublic: Google hopes to protect users with open source differential privacy library\n\nIn August, Check Point researchers disclosed vulnerabilities in the WhatsApp messaging platform which could be exploited to \"essentially put words in [a contact's] mouth.\"\n\nThe bugs allowed attackers to intercept and manipulate messages through the service -- which is protected via end-to-end encryption -- as well as change the identity of senders, and to send messages which are marked as 'private' but could be viewed publicly in a group chat.\n\nFacebook said that one of the vulnerabilities has been fixed, but the other two were problematic due to structural and architectural limitations.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
