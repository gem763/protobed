The news was greeted with dismay in Downing Street.\n\nOne of Mr Bercow's friends told this newspaper: 'The MPs put him under huge pressure not to leave the Chair until Brexit is sorted.\n\n'He is now unlikely to give any hint of his going until after the summer recess at the earliest, and may well wait to see if the new October 31 deadline is met before hanging up his boots.\n\n'Ken Clarke, who John listens to more than any other MP, was a particularly decisive voice, telling him that it was his duty to stay.'\n\nBut after Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom announced in The Mail on Sunday last month that the Conservative Party would defy convention by putting up a candidate against the Speaker in the next Election, meaning he would be almost certain to lose his seat, Mr Bercow finally bowed to the pressure and announced that he would step down at the end of this month.\n\nAfter Mr Johnson became Prime Minister in July, the remainer rebels stepped up their campaign against the Government's attempt to concentrate minds in Brussels by vowing to leave at the end of October with or without a deal.\n\nFormer Chancellor Philip Hammond, who quit the Government when Mr Johnson was elected, became the de facto leader of the 'rebel alliance', drawing on his contacts from his time at the Treasury and the Foreign Office to help Mr Grieve and Oliver Letwin draft the Benn Act, which forced Mr Johnson to delay Brexit if he couldn't reach a deal.\n\nFormer Chancellor Philip Hammond (pictured), who quit the Government when Mr Johnson was elected, became the de facto leader of the 'rebel alliance'\n\nColleagues of Mr Hammond claim that he was motivated more by 'a toxic personal loathing' of Mr Johnson, rather than 'a burning dislike of Brexit'.\n\nThe law was immediately dubbed the Surrender Act by No 10, where officials say they have evidence that the legislation was drafted with the assistance of EU bureaucrats and 'foreign Governments'.\n\nIn a trenchant statement released to this paper, a senior No 10 source said: 'The Government is working on extensive investigations into Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn [who tabled the Bill] and their involvement with foreign powers and the funding of their activities. Governments have proper rules for drafting legislation, but nobody knows what organisations are pulling these strings.\n\n'We will demand the disclosure of all details of their personal communications with other states. The drafting of primary legislation in collusion with foreign powers must be fully investigated.'\n\nMr Johnson said that there were 'real questions' about how the primary legislation was drawn up.\n\nIn a trenchant statement released to this paper, a senior No 10 source said: 'The Government is working on extensive investigations into Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin (pictured) and Hilary Benn [who tabled the Bill] and their involvement with foreign powers'\n\nMr Hammond insisted that it was 'categorically untrue' that he had drafted any legislation with the help of the EU. And Mr Grieve claimed the allegations were 'ridiculous', adding: 'The tone of these statements comes across like the propaganda of a totalitarian state.'\n\nYesterday's astonishing scenes in the Commons, when Mr Letwin moved to force Mr Johnson to send a letter to Brussels asking for an extension, were the climax of the rebels' nine month campaign.\n\nWhen we revealed last week that Mr Hammond, Mr Grieve and Mr Letwin were plotting to sabotage Mr Johnson's Brexit by forcing him to delay Brexit beyond October 31 even if he agreed a deal with Brussels, Mr Hammond wrote on Twitter: 'The Mail on Sunday is wrong'.\n\nOn the contrary, when Mr Letwin laid down yesterday's amendment \u2013 attempting to force the Prime Minister to do exactly that \u2013 Mr Hammond was revealed as one of the leading signatories.\n\nMr Hammond was maintaining his militant line yesterday, writing: 'I haven't come this far seeking to avoid No Deal in 2019 to be duped into voting for a heavily camouflaged No Deal at the end of 2020.'\n\nSir Nicholas Soames said he would vote in favour of the deal and that his other 20 colleagues who had the whip removed would 'by and large vote for it'.\n\nThe rebel group, which also includes former Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, was bitterly split about whether to support the deal, with one prominent member warning that it looked like a 'pretty hard Brexit' for Great Britain even if it amounted to a 'very, very soft Brexit' for Northern Ireland.\n\nThere was more of a consensus that Mr Johnson should be forced to delay Brexit by supporting the Letwin amendment, but as public anger grew over their stance, one by one they fell in behind the Government's line.
