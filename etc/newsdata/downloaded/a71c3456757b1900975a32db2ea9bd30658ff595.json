Davis says he wasn\u2019t even aware of the league\u2019s rule regarding personal messages.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people were aware of the policy that was in place \u2014 I wasn\u2019t even fully aware of it,\u201d Davis told the Times-Picayune. \u201cI just wanted to put it out and just kind of help fans who care about the game understand a more intricate part of the game. . . .\n\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t want to be fined. Nobody wants to lose money but I think any time that the conversation about God is brought up, especially in these times, I think it\u2019s always a positive or silver lining. If he can get glory from it, I think he can get glory from it whether I personally wear the headband or don\u2019t wear the headband. He\u2019s always gonna be in control of the whole situation. We\u2019re still all good.\u201d\n\nThe rule is an odd one considering the NFL promotes the \u201cMy Cause, My Cleats\u201d program, an initiative which allows which allows players to write personal messages on their shoes.\n\nDavis, undeterred, plans to sell the \u201cMan of God\u201d headbands and donate the proceeds to charity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to put it out where fans can wear it, and I can wear it through them,\u201d Davis said.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "Saints linebacker Demario Davis has decided to retire his \"Man of God\" headband, after the NFL fined him $7,017 for wearing it.", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images-4-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
