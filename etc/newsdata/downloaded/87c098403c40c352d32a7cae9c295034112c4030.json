(Matt Denny/Smith-Madrone Winery)\n\nRiesling is arguably the most misunderstood wine. Sommeliers, wine writers, people who spend too much of their disposable income on wine, tend to love it. And yet, \u201cI don\u2019t like riesling \u2014 it\u2019s too sweet,\u201d is a common refrain from casual wine drinkers, whenever I rave about it.\n\nThat\u2019s understandable. Generations of Americans favored sweet wine, and riesling fit the bill. Whether inexpensive plonk from Germany or generic white wine from California, we drank lots of it. But somewhere along the way, we learned that \u201cdry\u201d wine is supposed to be better. Chardonnay and sauvignon blanc eclipsed riesling in U.S. vineyards and American imaginations.\n\nToday there\u2019s a bit of a riesling renaissance in the United States. Riesling shines in certain regions, such as New York\u2019s Finger Lakes, Michigan\u2019s Old Mission Peninsula and Washington state\u2019s Columbia Valley. Some dedicated winemakers are crafting exceptional riesling in Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley, and there are a few notable holdouts in California.\n\nHere are five things to know about riesling and to encourage you to explore this exciting wine.\n\n1. They are NOT all sweet!\n\nRiesling is a versatile wine, because it can be racy and bone dry, unctuous and sweet, and everything in between. That\u2019s why consumers can be confused \u2014 we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re buying unless the label tells us. And it doesn\u2019t, usually. But there are clues.\n\nRieslings from Austria, Australia and New Zealand are almost always dry, and the rare dessert wines are usually marked as such. Dry German rieslings may be labeled as \u201ctrocken,\u201d and the top bottlings called Erste Lage or Grosses Gewachs are always dry. U.S. wineries may make a range of styles. These may be labeled as Dry or Semi-Dry, to indicate moderate sweetness, which I prefer to call fruitiness. Ripe fruit, after all, tastes sweet.\n\nOr the back label may sport a scale indicating Dry, Medium Dry, Medium Sweet or Sweet. This scale was developed by a group or wineries called the International Riesling Foundation, and it\u2019s a little more complex than it sounds. A wine\u2019s perceptible sweetness is not just a question of how much sugar is left in the wine after fermentation. The IRF scale factors in sugar, acidity and the wine\u2019s pH level to give us an indication of how sweet or dry the wine will taste.\n\n[Wine 101: Key terms to help you find the bottle of your dreams]\n\n2. Riesling is a great food wine.\n\nA food-wine pairing maxim pitches sweeter wine with spicy Asian foods, because the sugar in the wine moderates the food\u2019s heat. Riesling fits that, especially a semi-dry version. But the wine\u2019s key is really its fruitiness and acidity, a combination that equal versatility.\n\n\u201cRiesling can be made in many different styles, from low to high alcohol, from dry, to off-dry and then the many dessert styles,\u201d says Stu Smith, winemaker at Smith-Madrone Vineyards on Napa Valley\u2019s Spring Mountain. Smith-Madrone planted its riesling vineyard in 1972 and is now celebrated as one of the few riesling holdouts in the land of cabernet sauvignon. \u201cIt goes with just about any food, meat, soup or cuisine \u2014 or all by itself.\u201d\n\nRiesling is great with smoked fish, salads, curries, even braised beef \u2014 one of my most memorable meals was beef braised in Riesling, with spaetzle. It may have helped that I was in Germany, of course. And if you buy a bottle that turns out to be too sweet for your taste, save it for a salty cheese or dessert.\n\n3. Riesling is a megaphone for terroir.\n\nA conversation with a German winemaker can turn into a dizzying discourse on how a riesling from a vineyard on blue slate soils tastes different from one grown on red slate. But you don\u2019t have to be a geologist to appreciate riesling\u2019s ability to express its origins.\n\nIn cool climates, such as New York\u2019s Finger Lakes and Michigan\u2019s Old Mission Peninsula, riesling takes on a lean, racy profile. Warmer climes such as the Columbia Valley in Washington state or Napa Valley give riesling a richer body, with riper fruit flavors.\n\nBut there are differences, and U.S. riesling is especially exciting now, as winemakers explore its different expressions. Rieslings from Seneca Lake in the Finger Lakes tend to have a delicate texture with an accent of lime zest, while ones from nearby Keuka Lake are richer. Brooks winery makes more than 20 rieslings, including several single-vineyard bottlings, that vividly demonstrate the terroirs and microclimates of Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley.\n\n[Love it or hate it, oak is important in wine. Here are 5 things to know]\n\n4. Riesling ages well.\n\nWine lovers who are still collectors should keep a stash of riesling in their cellars. We tend to consider white wines at their peak just a year or two after the vintage, but riesling\u2019s acidity gives it a potential for long life.\n\n\u201cWhy do I keep making riesling?\u201d Smith asks. \u201cBecause I love drinking it while it\u2019s young, and savor it when it\u2019s aged.\u201d\n\n5.

Our greatest value of the week is the Barnard Griffin Riesling 2017 from Washington state\u2019s Columbia Valley, a nice instance of what this region does with the grape. We also have a stellar bottle from the Finger Lakes, a Napa Valley holdout against cabernet sauvignon, and two nice examples from Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley.\n\n\u2014 Dave McIntyre\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nBarnard Griffin Riesling 2017\n\nColumbia Valley, Wash., $12\n\nWashington state\u2019s Columbia Valley tends to showcase a ripe, fruity profile of riesling.
