Garrett on Mount Etna, Europe's highest and most active volcano. Garrett credits her ballet skills with helping her climb the volcano. (Tobias Schorr)\n\nI dug the toe of my hiking boot into the crumbly, scorched sands as I marched up the curvy rim of the crater\u2019s slope. Plodding one baby step at a time, I ignored the 10-story drop-off on my left. A stumble or stray thought might easily send me hurtling down a long, pebbly abyss, or initiate an avalanche of volcanic debris.\n\nIt was the final day of a week-long expedition on Sicily\u2019s Mount Etna, Europe\u2019s highest and most volatile volcano. Eruptions occur here nearly every year. Shifting clouds and frequent downpours had prevented my group from approaching the 10,912 foot summit for five days. So we traversed Etna\u2019s steep flanks on daily-six hour hikes instead, through magnificent birch forests, icy snow patches and in some places knee-deep in ash from previous eruptions.\n\nWhen we awakened one morning to news of an overnight eruption and a forecast of finally clear skies, our local guide told us we better get there quickly in case lava flows and explosive activity shut down the mountain.\n\nA gondola ride up the 8,200-foot ascent tossed us around like an errant swing set. It was followed by a grueling three-hour trek over a volcanic smorgasbord of chunky lava \u2014 ropy pahoehoe formations, cinder cones and a goulash of grit. All the while, nature\u2019s soundtrack of subterranean rumbles dispatched a frisson of menace.\n\nHard hats clipped on, gas masks at the ready, we prepared for the possibility of ash emissions and basalt block explosions, which can claim lives in an instant. (Nine tourists were killed by a surprise explosion in 1979; two in 1987.) Finally, we arrived at a lookout, just beneath Etna\u2019s 10,000-foot-high Southeast crater, with a direct view of the fiery flank eruption of ruby magma.\n\nI had signed up months in advance for this \u201cEtna Discovery\u201d hiking and study tour, organized by German-based Volcano Adventures, but with no time to prepare for this grueling expedition described as requiring moderate to excellent physical condition.\n\n\n\nGiannella M. Garrett enjoys her favorite pastime: ballet. (Melanie Futorian)\n\nInstead, I\u2019d depend on my singular routine exercise for the past 40 years \u2014 a daily one-and-a-half hour classical ballet class. It was a commitment I kept to doggedly, but I often wondered, what was I gaining that I could apply outdoors? And in this case, would I be able to keep up with experienced hikers?\n\nTo my surprise, I returned to our rustic, timber wood mountain lodge each night exhausted but elated that I had not only endured, but had also completed a few extra activities that some of the others sat out because of issues with acrophobia, exhaustion and sore knees. I credit my ballet training for accomplishing the demands of this expedition. And once back home, I also concluded that hiking had improved my ballet.\n\n'Strong feet, ankles, toes'\n\nI started studying classical dance in my late 20s when I moved to New York. It provided a safe, indoor exercise activity. I soon discovered it offered a lot more: expressive movement, a meditative routine and appreciation for an art form hundreds of years old.\n\nAt 66, I appreciate how ballet has helped me counteract gravity\u2019s inevitable sag, encouraged good posture and expanded the array of activities I feel confident engaging in \u2014 such as hiking.\n\nWas this synergy I felt between ballet and hiking on point? I got in touch with Richard Anton Marsden, a former New York City Ballet dancer, and nature aficionado and ballet coach.\n\n\u201cBalance, alignment, strong feet, ankles and toes are the foundation of ballet and they are necessary for hiking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fondu, which is a pli\u00e9 on one leg, strengthens the feet and helps land jumps. Going on relev\u00e9, or half toe, promotes muscle memory and coordination so if you\u2019re about to fall you can catch yourself faster.\u201d\n\nAwareness of the position and movement of the body in space and reacting quickly to that with necessary adjustments is called proprioception. Elizabeth Barchi, a staff physician at Harkness Center for Dance Injuries at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital, said ballet develops proprioception because \u201cit requires both an intense awareness of your body and mental discipline.\u201d\n\nA foot injury led Brooklyn-born Carlos Kerr, a soloist with the Tanz Luzerner Theater dance ensemble in Lucerne, Switzerland, to hiking. \u201cMy left foot had tendinitis in the top part of my metatarsal that was affecting mobility of the big toe,\u201d he said. \u201cI went to see a specialist in Zurich. She prescribed hiking to help strengthen the smaller muscles in my feet.\u201d\n\nLauren Borowski, a staff physician at the Harkness Center specializing in bone health and stress injuries, said she sees the synergy between dance and climbing Etna.\n\n\u201cHiking on uneven terrain forces you to utilize the muscles and tendons around the ankle,\u201d she said. In ballet, \u201cdancers learn hip, knee and ankle alignment, which is really helpful when you\u2019re doing a lot of repetitive movement like hiking. Being able to keep your knees tracking over your toes is important, so you don\u2019t develop patellofemoral knee pain, or \u2018runner\u2019s knee,\u2019 which is common to hiking.\u201d\n\nKerr followed the Zurich specialist\u2019s advice and took a two-hour hike up Mount Pilatus, a 6,982-foot massif that towers over Lucerne, then hopped on a tram to reach its peak.\n\n\u201cAbove the clouds, I realized hiking can really be uplifting,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a dancer, you always feel that endurance is in your favor because our ballet repertoire can go from adagio [slow movement] to grand allegro [big fast moves] and become very aerobic quickly.\u201d\n\nHe recalled a performance that required intense mental attention and physical presence for 90 minutes straight. \u201cWhen I\u2019m hiking and surrounded by nature, I go into a similar feeling as if I\u2019m in class,\u201d he said. \u201cAware of the ground. How my foot articulates. How I navigate the rocks.\u201d And, yes, his toe healed.\n\n\u201cBallet takes a lot of mental and emotional discipline to keep yourself going day in and day out,\u201d Barchi said. \u201cI coach students about learning to break things down so it doesn\u2019t feel so overwhelming. Just focus on what\u2019s in front of you. That\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s a useful skill in every part of your life, even hiking.\u201d\n\nCross-training\n\nThere was a time when ballet dancers were discouraged from participating in other athletic endeavors.\n\nBarchi performed as a principal dancer with Brandywine Ballet in West Chester, Pa., for six years through college and medical school. She said she remembers being told that running might cause her to develop big thighs, considered unesthetic for ballerinas. \u201cNow the leadership in the big ballet companies understands that it\u2019s in the cross-training that they can really push the technique and get that strengthening,\u201d she said. Willowy and ephemeral are no longer prerequisites for ballet bodies.\n\nFor Leah Merchant, a soloist with Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, said \u201chiking is a little selfish in that I get to go consume beauty instead of create it when I dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cDancers are the border collies of the art world,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to need the physical exhaustion. We\u2019ve worked years and years, and we\u2019re conditioned to want that. We have to be able to push our boundaries and we have to push past our comfort zones, like fear of heights or those moments where you feel you can\u2019t make it any longer.\u201d\n\nBorowski, who completed an undergraduate degree in dance while preparing for medical school, said she agreed. \u201cThere are so many boundaries dancers push,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s performance anxiety onstage or in a class, or trying a new lift with a partner, those are cliffs you might fall from,\u201d Borowski said. \u201cBut you just have to try, and trust your partner, yourself, and the work you\u2019ve put into it to hold you.\u201d\n\nAt times, climbing Etna felt like dancing with danger.\n\nThere are weeks when gazing into the ballet mirror reflects back a chaos of distorted lines and missteps. That\u2019s when I remind myself to look beyond my feeble attempts at perfection.\n\nThe more I keep dancing and hiking, the more I discover the joy and power of filling space with movement, living in the present, evading injury and embracing the unexpected.\n\nRead more\n\nHow to reset your body clock and get better sleep, with hiking boots and a tent\n\nAt 78, this ballerina is still going strong\n\nExercising even a little can improve your health\n\nHow to build up your workout \u2014 and your health \u2014 in small steps", "description": "Balance and strength from dance training prepared her for the physical demands of a grueling and dangerous expedition.", "authors": ["Giannella M.
