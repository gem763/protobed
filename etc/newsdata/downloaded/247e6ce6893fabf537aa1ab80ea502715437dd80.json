John Garamendi (D-Calif.) was on CNN this morning and said Democrats should hold a formal impeachment inquiry vote, as Republicans have been demanding. | Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images\n\nSPEAKER NANCY PELOSI has led a fairly unified Democratic charge toward impeachment. She\u2019s said consistently that Democrats don\u2019t need a formal vote to move forward, but a few cracks have started to show. Rep. JOHN GARAMENDI, a Democrat who represents a district in Northern California, was on CNN this morning and said Democrats should hold a formal impeachment inquiry vote, as Republicans have been demanding. He predicted that\u2019s what would eventually happen.\n\n-- BETO O\u2019ROURKE told NBC\u2019S HALLIE JACKSON that he supports a vote as well. \u201cI would love to remove that as a talking point or a reason for the kind of obstruction you\u2019re seeing from the president,\u201d he said.\n\nOF COURSE, this is just a few Democrats. And Rep. RO KHANNA (D-Calif.) also told Jackson this morning that he didn't think a vote would work because the White House will stonewall. So, it\u2019s hard to get a real sense if the process argument that both House Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY and the WHITE HOUSE have been making is penetrating Democratic lawmakers\u2019 thinking, since they are scattered across the country and haven\u2019t had a chance to discuss the issue in person.\n\nA FINAL DECISION will be made by Pelosi, who hasn\u2019t ruled it out. But Pelosi advisers continue to argue that it\u2019s unnecessary. They also point out that it was months before the House engaged in a similar vote during the Nixon impeachment process. And, even if Pelosi does move to vote on a formal impeachment inquiry, it\u2019s unclear if the White House would participate. On a conference call Tuesday night, a senior administration official would not commit to cooperating with Democrats.\n\nSYRIA FALLOUT -- \u201cTurkey Begins Syria Attack, Targeting Militia Backed by U.S.,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Ben Hubbard in Beirut, Lebanon: \u201cMr. Erdogan said the operation aimed to \u2018prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border,\u2019 but provided no other information about whether Turkish ground troops had entered Syria or how far in they would go.\n\n\u201cA spokesman for the United States-backed militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces, said that Turkish warplanes had begun carrying out airstrikes. Civilians were reported to be fleeing the border towns of Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, which were being pounded by airstrikes and shelling \u2026 Earlier Wednesday, the Syrian Democractic Forces had mobilized and warned of a \u2018humanitarian catastrophe.\u2019\u201d NYT\n\n-- REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-Wyo.) sends a message directly to President DONALD TRUMP on Twitter this morning: \u201cNews from Syria is sickening. Turkish troops preparing to invade Syria from the north, Russian-backed forces from the south, ISIS fighters attacking Raqqa. Impossible to understand why @realDonaldTrump is leaving America\u2019s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS.\u201d\n\n-- AND THIS \u2026 SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.): \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S RESPONSE -- @realDonaldTrump at 7:36 a.m.: \u201cFighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East. Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\u201d\n\nGood Wednesday afternoon, and a meaningful fast to those observing Yom Kippur.\n\nVANITY FAIR Q&A: \u201cTwo Days in the Life of Nancy Pelosi, Political Grandmaster,\u201d by Abigail Tracy with Annie Leibovitz pics -- including one of the red coat: Vanity Fair\n\nTRUMKA THROWING COLD WATER ON TRUMP\u2019S TOP PRIORITY \u2026 \u201cTrumka says fast action on trade pact with Canada and Mexico would be \u2018colossal mistake,\u2019\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Erica Werner: \u201c\u2018If there was a vote before Thanksgiving, the agreement would be defeated,\u2019 AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told The Washington Post this week in an interview. Support from the 12.5 million-strong AFL-CIO would be critical in persuading many House Democrats to back the new trade deal, giving Trumka enormous sway in negotiations.\u201d\n\nA message from The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s drug pricing proposal would put foreign bureaucrats in control of Americans\u2019 medicine cabinet, lead to access restrictions for America\u2019s patients, and stifle innovation, threatening the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow.

He said the National Security Council would not publicly announce that $141 million in State Department assistance was being restored after being held up in what the White House described as a normal review.\u201d NYT\n\nDEEP DIVE -- \u201cTwo Key Players In The Ukraine Controversy Spent Lavishly As They Dug For Dirt On Biden,\u201d by BuzzFeed\u2019s Michael Sallah and Emma Loop: \u201cThere was a $1,410 charge to a Palm Beach limousine service and nearly $20,000 in expenses at Trump hotels in Washington, DC, and New York. There were bills running to hundreds of dollars at exclusive restaurants such as Novikov in London and BLT Prime in Washington. During one of his many trips to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, there was a $657 charge at Tootsie, the popular strip club in the heart of the city. \u2026\n\n\u201cBuzzFeed News obtained unprecedented access to scores of bank records from private business accounts controlled by [Lev] Parnas and his partner, Igor Fruman, as they carried out a campaign now at the center of the first presidential impeachment inquiry in a generation.\u201d BuzzFeed\n\nNBC\u2019S ANDY ECKARDT and DAVID LI: \u201cAt least 2 dead in shooting in Germany in possible \u2018right-wing extremist crime\u2019\u201d: \u201cThe country's federal prosecutor\u2019s office took over the investigation of the shooting due [to] its \u2018extraordinary importance\u2019 because of the possibility of extremism. A police spokesperson in the city of Halle told NBC News that shots were fired \u2018at several locations\u2019 in that community, about 100 miles south of Berlin. \u2018Kebab restaurants and a synagogue are located in the area where the shots were fired,\u2019 a police spokesperson said.\u201d NBC\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

He signed it anyway! If the Supreme Court upholds DACA, it gives the President extraordinary powers, far greater than ever thought. If they do what is right and do not let DACA stand, with all of its negative legal implications, the Republicans and Democrats will have a DEAL to let them stay in our Country, in very short order. It would actually benefit DACA, and be done the right way!\u201d\n\n-- C\u2019MON \u2026 THERE IS NO EVIDENCE that a DACA deal is in the works, and it\u2019s hard to even fathom that it would have any chance of passing in an election year. And the president has argued in other contexts that his powers are virtually unlimited.\n\nTHE INVESTIGATIONS \u2026 JOSH GERSTEIN: \u201cFeds, bank battle over Manafort\u2019s assets\u201d: \u201cThe Justice Department and a Chicago bank are still fighting over former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s real estate and cash, more than a year after he pleaded guilty in the investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\u201cWho wins the unfolding battle could have a significant impact for the ongoing political debate over the cost of Mueller\u2019s probe and claims that it broke even financially. In a court filing Tuesday, Justice Department attorneys and lawyers for The Federal Savings Bank said they\u2019re at odds about how to proceed over the bank\u2019s claim of ownership interests in three Manafort assets: his swanky Long Island estate valued at about $10 million, a Brooklyn, N.Y. brownstone worth about $4 million, and a $2.5 million bank account.\u201d POLITICO\n\n2020 WATCH -- ALLY MUTNICK: \u201cImpeachment threat is helping GOP recruit new candidates\u201d: \u201cHouse Republicans have been struggling mightily to recruit candidates in key battleground districts, given the likelihood of serving in the minority, possibly with a new Democratic president. But the Democratic impeachment drive is delivering a much-needed jolt to their efforts to retake the chamber.\n\n\u201cOnce-wary potential candidates are preparing to come off the sidelines, according to party recruiters, and the GOP\u2019s small-dollar donor base is stepping up to help the party compete against Democrats who are practically awash in money \u2026 Only 11 of the 31 Democrats in districts Trump carried in 2016 had a challenger who had raised more than $100,000 by the end of the second quarter. Impeachment could provide a means to play catch up.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cIn Shift, Warren Says She\u2019ll Forgo Big Money Events if Nominated,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Shane Goldmacher: \u201cFrom the day [Elizabeth] Warren announced her plan to skip traditional fund-raisers in February, she had said the pledge only applied to the primary. \u2018I do not believe in unilateral disarmament,\u2019 she said then on MSNBC.\n\n\u201cBut she told CBS News in an interview posted on Tuesday evening that, even as President Trump has set fund-raising records, she would not change how her campaign raises money if she won the Democratic nomination.\u201d NYT\n\n-- AMISH FOR TRUMP? -- \u201cThe famously secluded Amish are the target of a Republican campaign to drum up Pennsylvania votes for Trump,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Julie Zauzmer in Manheim, Pa.: \u201cAmish PAC aims to win more votes for Trump in 2020 in a state both the president and the Democrats are desperate to win. Amish people tend to align strongly on policy with Republicans, who share their opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. But making voters out of the Amish, who forgo technology like television and the Internet and who believe fiercely in the separation of their religious community from government intrusion, may be a steep goal.\u201d WaPo\n\nHISTORY LESSON -- \u201cWhat Joe Biden Learned at the Last Two Impeachments,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Matt Flegenheimer: \u201cDecades before he moved from ensemble figure to leading character in the nation\u2019s impeachment theater, friends and peers from his Senate days say those episodes made plain to Mr. Biden just how damaging and unseemly the proceedings could be for all involved.\n\n\u201cIn both public remarks and private conversations with colleagues, Mr. Biden conveyed his discomfort with overturning the will of the voters, regardless of the executive transgression. He suggested that public opinion should be taken into consideration, even for senators who preferred to vote their conscience, since it was the choice of the electorate that lawmakers presumed to override.\u201d NYT\n\nTHE POLICY PRIMARY -- \u201cHow Elizabeth Warren would address environmental justice,\u201d by Eric Wolff: \u201cWarren\u2019s plan calls for cleaning up pollution that disproportionately affects low-income communities, building wealth and improving access to health care for affected areas, and helping at-risk areas adapt to global warming. Her plan leans heavily on the Green New Deal, which calls for a rewiring of the U.S. economy as part of the effort to fight climate change.\n\n\u201cWarren\u2019s plan calls for spending at least $1 trillion on vulnerable communities over the next decade to address the decades of pollution that has harmed low-income and minority communities.\u201d POLITICO ...

He vows to make the right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade a part of federal law, so that it would stand even if Roe is overturned \u2026\n\n\u201c[T]he former Texas congressman promises to champion the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment \u2026 O\u2019Rourke proposes to allow the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the ability to require large employers to \u2018automatically impose a remedy to close gaps, fining companies that fail to correct disparities.\u2019 He also wants to sign the \u2018Paycheck Fairness Act.\u2019\u201d Salon \u2026 The plan\n\nVAPING UPDATE -- \u201cU.S. Army Is Treating Two Soldiers for Vaping-Related Lung Illness,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Ben Kesling and Jennifer Maloney: \u201cThe U.S. Army is treating two active-duty soldiers in its medical facilities for vaping-related lung illness, officials said days after most of the military banned e-cigarette sales at base exchanges. The Army is the first branch of the U.S. military to report cases of an ailment that has been linked to at least 23 deaths in the U.S. \u2026 Army officials said they are still investigating the cases of the two soldiers and haven\u2019t determined the substances they used.\u201d WSJ\n\nVALLEY TALK -- \u201cZuckerberg expected to testify at hearing on cryptocurrency plan,\u201d by Steven Overly and Zachary Warmbrodt: \u201cFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify this month before the House Financial Services Committee as the social networking giant tries to ease concerns from lawmakers and regulators about its embattled cryptocurrency project Libra, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cThe hearing, which is also expected to focus on Facebook's impact on financial services and housing, is scheduled for Oct. 23, according to a committee member\u2019s aide.
