(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nProgressives attack Joe Biden for having followed customs and mores of that foreign country that is the past.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: The following is Jonah Goldberg\u2019s weekly \u201cnews\u201dletter, the G-File. Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.\n\nDear Reader (And victims of wind-noise cancer everywhere),\n\nI\u2019m sitting about a block north of the Trump Hotel on Central Park West smoking a cigar on Thursday afternoon trying to write this \u201cnews\u201dletter. If seven-day units of time were people, this one would be wearing a Millard Fillmore mask, slathering itself with salmon viscera and running through the nearby polar-bear enclosure at the Central Park Zoo shouting \u201cTrieste belongs to the Italians!\u201d \u2014 which is my way of saying it\u2019s been a crazy week.\n\nI wrote my column today on Joe Biden and the effort to un-person him over the fact he has a long history of acting around human beings like a small child at a toy store; Oh, let me see! I just want to touch it! Can I hold that? Oooooo soft!\n\nNow I want to be clear \u2014 not in the Scientologist sense, but in the expository sense. I dislike the entire suite of Biden mannerisms and affectations. I do not think he\u2019s a bad person, nor do I think he\u2019s an idiot despite the many nakedly ridiculous things he\u2019s said over the years. Here\u2019s how I put it almost 14 years ago (typos corrected):\n\nHe says interesting things, from time to time. I think he makes a fair point here and there. He was correct, for example, that Congress needed to have a real debate over the war. I think he has some obvious verbal intelligence. But, again, what\u2019s fascinating \u2014 and what might be distracting some folks from seeing his underlying-yet-occasional smarts \u2014 is that he lets his ego and vanity get in the way. The man loves his voice so much, you\u2019d expect him to be following it around in a grey Buick, in defiance of a restraining order, as it walks home from school. He seems to think his teeth are some kind of hypnotic punctuation marks which can momentarily disorient the listener and absolve him from any of Western civilization\u2019s usual imperatives to stop talking. Listening to him speechify is like playing an intellectual game of whack-a-mole where every now and then the fuzzy head of a good point pops up from the tundra but before you can pin it down, he starts talking about how he went to the store and saw a squirrel on the way and it was brown which brings to mind Brown v. Board of Ed which most people don\u2019t understand because [TEETH FLASH] he taught Brown in his law-school course and [TEETH FLASH] Mr. Chairman I\u2019m going to get right to it and besides these aren\u2019t the droids you\u2019re looking for. . . .\n\nI don\u2019t like the way Joe talks (and talks and talks, occasionally using words borrowed without attribution) and I don\u2019t like the way he touches people either. He is a space invader, as in personal space, and I generally cannot stand close encounters with space invaders. People who touch me on the arm to emphasize a point drive me crazy, and if it weren\u2019t for the rule of law and all that, I would have stabbed a few in the forearm with a ballpoint pen on more than one occasion, including on national television.\n\nBiden\u2019s behavior toward women offends me, but not because of Me Too but for old-fashioned, fusty, fuddy conservative reasons. Men, especially powerful men, should not take liberties touching anybody, but especially women. I once had to take an online sensitivity course for an employer (don\u2019t get any ideas; everyone else there did too). When the instructor explained that you shouldn\u2019t just start giving women back rubs without their permission and that you shouldn\u2019t keep asking subordinates out for a date after they\u2019ve repeatedly said \u201cNo,\u201d I thought to myself \u201cSelf, this is a great example of how we have to repackage good manners in the guise of \u2018diversity training.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yeah, Biden\u2019s behavior is bad. And, I think Emily Yoffe makes a very good case that he\u2019s getting what he deserves. As she writes, \u201cJoe Biden is now living in the world of accusation he helped to create.\u201d Biden reminds me of that line from The Dark Knight: \u201cYou\u2019ll either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\u201d If he had checked out or simply retired from public life in 2016, he would be remembered as a hero by many of the very people now trying to weaponize his legacy against him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I will not cry for Joe if he\u2019s undone by all this. But it still doesn\u2019t feel right to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Most Acceptable Bigotries\n\nIt\u2019s funny. Progressives are quick to defend the customs and mores of non-Western peoples. They celebrate women who wear the hijab. They defend non-traditional cultures at home and traditional cultures abroad. This doesn\u2019t bother me, really. Indeed, in some cases I often find it admirable and wish more conservatives would do likewise. But what does bother me is how this tolerance tends to be selective. For many progressives, when the practices are usefully at odds with mainstream traditional culture, diversity is wonderful. But when the practices are consistent with or \u2014 shudder \u2014 reinforcing of traditional culture, progressives are often appalled.\n\nFor example, it was revealed a while ago that Mike Pence has some onerous rules for how he behaves around women, and progressives were horrified. But Pence\u2019s practices would be celebrated or at least defended were he a devout Muslim. Just last week Beto O\u2019Rourke found it necessary to apologize for thanking his wife for taking the lead on raising their kids. What was he supposed to do? Denounce her for meekly accepting the traditional gender roles of the patriarchy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a good example of having such an open mind your brain falls out. It also calls to mind Robert Frost\u2019s observation that a liberal is someone who is so broadminded they won\u2019t take their own side in an argument.\n\nBut the glib and fashionable double standard against traditionalists and orthodox Christians isn\u2019t what I have in mind. It\u2019s the far more widespread and fashionable bigotry against the past.\n\nIf a visitor from Sudan comes to your house for dinner, it\u2019s simply good manners to make allowances for the cultural differences. If you go to a foreign country, it\u2019s understood by most decent people that you should be making the lion\u2019s share of adjustments to how people do things. The quintessential ugly American refuses to bend to \u2014 or even respect \u2014 the norms of foreign cultures, norms that can sometimes be ugly, nasty, or backward by a lot of Western standards.\n\nThe arguments in favor of deferring to foreign cultures ranges from Emily Post bromides about etiquette to swirling torrents of words about colonial this, patriarchal that, and imperial the other thing. Fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now imagine that someone comes from the past, which is a kind of foreign land as well. For some people, particularly those wielding the \u201cnightstick of wokeness,\u201d as Peggy Noonan calls it, carrying any old values or assumptions into the present day is a form of heresy or, really, contamination. Beto thanks his wife, and the thronging wokesters shout the equivalent of \u201c2319!\u201d and bust out the cultural hazmat equipment.\n\nAgain, Biden\u2019s habits are unappealing to me, and I understand why people accuse him of being insensitive to other peoples\u2019 comfort with his antics. But there\u2019s a remarkable amount of insensitivity going the other way as well.\n\nForget Biden for a moment. I\u2019ve never understood why we immediately assume that young people are more open-minded, forward-thinking, or moral than older people. Sure, sometimes they are. But sometimes they\u2019re not. Sometimes they\u2019re just open-minded about the things they believe and closed-minded about everything else. And there are few things they are more closed-minded about than the past. I don\u2019t just mean the iconoclastic goons tearing down statues on college campuses, I mean many generally decent and intelligent young people who seem to take it as a given that moral progress has advanced in lockstep linearity with technological progress. Today, people \u2014 at least the right people \u2014 are simply better people than those from earlier generations.\n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of mythmaking about how Biden simply represents a bygone style of politics that was common for men of his generation. I don\u2019t recall Sam Nunn or Bill Bradley Eskimo-kissing anybody. And his case is by no means the best illustration of my point. But there\u2019s just something about the smug self-confidence of the most socially awkward generation in American history, many of whom struggle to talk on the phone, never mind go on a date, asserting with moral righteousness that their customs and norms are so obviously superior. If Biden were a visitor from another country, we\u2019d hear how charming his customs are. But because he allegedly comes from the past, it\u2019s fine to give a full airing to your bigotry against those kinds of people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nSo now I\u2019m at the Acela waiting area at Penn Station taking in the effulgent stench of this fetid hate crime against architecture which manages the unlikely feat of looking worse than it smells, something only Harry Reid and certain neighborhoods of Gary, Ind., have accomplished. Just to give you a sense of the kind of week I\u2019ve had: On Tuesday I had my appeal for my IRS audit; Wednesday, I had my colonoscopy. Rarely have I ever moved from the figurative to the literal in such a short period of time. I will spare you the details of throwing away all of those Paul Krugman columns during my Dark Night of the Bowl in preparation for the procedure. This is a family \u201cnews\u201dletter after all. But then Thursday I came to New York for business reasons, and I\u2019ll be back here all next week. At some point I\u2019ll be able to brief you all about everything, but for now it\u2019s time for the . . .\n\nCanine Update: So I\u2019m a little worried about Pippa\u2019s workout regimen. She\u2019s been limping a few times over the last couple weeks, and I think her age is starting to compete with her joi de vivre. Meanwhile, Zo\u00eb has been a pill. The other night, the Fair Jessica left a tray with some chicken bones on it unattended, and Zo\u00eb took one and was less than willing to give it back. A few nights before that, Pippa was snuggling in my lap while Zo\u00eb was resting in Jessica\u2019s. Zo\u00eb got jealous and complained, even though she was getting attention too. In a funk, she took a log of firewood off the pile and very ostentatiously made a scene about chewing on it with subdued rage. Meanwhile, out in the world, the girls are just loving the spring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nICYMI . . .\n\nLast week\u2019s G-File\n\nWhy is the media covering for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?\n\nIs Donald Trump pretending not to know how trade works, or does he actually not know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is the Guardian publishing propaganda for North Korea?\n\nThis week\u2019s first Remnant, with David French\n\nTrump is wrong about the border crisis, but Democrats are wrong that there is no crisis\n\nNotes on nationalism\n\nThis week\u2019s second Remnant, with Michael Strain\n\nAnd now, the weird stuff.\n\nDebby\u2019s April Fools\u2019 Day Links\n\nCorgis in the garden\n\nInside the Panopticon\n\nSome long-lost Raiders of the Ark footage\n\nRidley Scott elbow-deep in sheep intestines\n\nCane-wielding grandma rescues her priest\n\nThis is how werewolf transformations should be done.
