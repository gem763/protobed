Unnamed senior officials have told US media that the evidence suggests the strikes originated in the south of Iran.\n\nOfficials on Friday announced a moderate deployment of US troops to Saudi Arabia, to help boost its missile and air defences.\n\nBut the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard in Iran, Maj Gen Hossein Salami, warned on Saturday that the country's \"readiness to respond to any aggression is definitive\".\n\n\"Be careful, a limited aggression won't remain limited. We'll pursue any aggressor,\" he said at the opening of an exhibition of captured drones in the capital, Tehran. \"We'll continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.\"\n\nSpeaking at the same event, the head of the Guards' aerospace branch, Brig Gen Amirali Hajizadeh, said the US ought to learn from its past failures and that any attack on Iran would receive \"a crushing response\".\n\nThe country's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are an elite branch of Tehran's military and have been designated a terrorist organisation by the US.\n\nIran, the regional rival of Saudi Arabia, is an opponent of the US, and tensions between the two have risen markedly this year. The US said Iran was behind attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as on another four in May - accusations rejected by Tehran.", "description": "Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels offer to end all attacks on Saudi Arabia as part of a peace plan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nzpjf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
