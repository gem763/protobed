Jackson set a franchise record for carries by a quarterback that afternoon, the defense clamped down on Cincinnati, and that was enough.\n\nThe Ravens\u2019 23-17 win Sunday over these Bengals was a throwback to 2018, to a time when the defense was reliably dominant and the offense\u2019s most valuable asset was Jackson\u2019s elite feet. It was about as old-school a result as the Ravens have had all season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLess than a year after Jackson carried the ball a staggering 26 times for 119 yards in the first game of the post-Joe Flacco era, he left the M&T Bank Stadium field behind only one of his playing idols, Michael Vick, in single-game rushing yardage. Jackson finished with 19 carries for 152 yards and a touchdown and went 21-for-33 passing for 236 yards, the first player in NFL history to record at least 200 yards passing and 150 yards rushing in a regular season game.\n\nThe Ravens\u2019 defense, meanwhile, limited the Bengals to 250 yards \u2014 five fewer than it gave up in Jackson\u2019s debut. Just like old times.\n\n\u201cIt was a dogfight,\u201d guard Marshal Yanda said. \u201cIt was.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBaltimore\u2019s second straight win was not close until late, when penalties helped along a fourth-quarter touchdown drive by Cincinnati, setting up an ultimately unsuccessful onside kick. It probably should not have been even as close as it was: The Ravens nearly doubled the winless Bengals in yardage (497-250) and time of possession (39:42 to 20:18) and held even on the turnover battle (one apiece).\n\nAD\n\nBut even after Cincinnati returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown, the game never seemed out of Baltimore\u2019s control. That was often the feeling last season, when Jackson and the NFL\u2019s top-ranked defense choked the life out of most opponents with a style that didn\u2019t produce many big plays but certainly prevented them.\n\nOn Sunday, Jackson\u2019s improvements as a passer were obvious. With rookie wide receiver Marquise Brown sidelined by an ankle injury, the Bengals\u2019 lowly defense seemingly had to worry only about the 25-yard box in front of Jackson on every play. No one was running by them deep. Jackson still found tight end Mark Andrews six times for 99 yards, and six other receivers had multiple catches.\n\nAD\n\nThat did enough to open lanes for the Ravens\u2019 top-ranked rushing attack. Running backs Mark Ingram II, Gus Edwards and Justice Hill combined for 117 of the team\u2019s season-high 269 yards. On Baltimore\u2019s most time-consuming drive, a nearly 10-minute fourth-quarter possession that went 83 yards and ended, surprisingly, with only a field goal for a 23-10 lead, the Ravens ran for 73 yards.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI love running the ball,\u201d right tackle Orlando Brown Jr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I play the game. It\u2019s to pound other teams and dominate their fronts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love that, sitting over there on the sidelines, and you\u2019re just watching them march down the field,\u201d safety Chuck Clark said. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping us off the field, and they\u2019re just racking up yards and getting points \u2014 getting some type of score, at least. Love it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRavens players and coaches have talked about how this offense will evolve this season, adapting to personnel and opponents. Through six weeks, there have already been two distinct iterations: the early-season, high-flying passing attack highlighted by Andrews and Brown and, more recently, the ground-and-pound offense that Sunday finished with more carries than pass attempts for the second straight week and third overall.\n\nAD\n\nThe defense has changed because it has had to \u2014 injuries, blown assignments, schematic decisions. And it\u2019s improved because it\u2019s had nowhere to go but up, really. After allowing 500-yard games in back-to-back losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Cleveland Browns, the Ravens held the Pittsburgh Steelers and Bengals to a combined 519.\n\nThe necessary caveats apply: Pittsburgh was playing with a second-string quarterback, and then a third-string quarterback. Cincinnati was without star wide receiver A.J. Green and its top offensive tackles. But the Ravens were missing starting linebacker Patrick Onwuasor and cornerback Jimmy Smith on Sunday, too, not to mention their two lost-for-the-season defensive backs, Tony Jefferson and Tavon Young. For now, they\u2019re winning battles of attrition.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey played fantastic,\u201d Coach John Harbaugh said of the defense. \u201cThey did another great job in sudden change again. . . . The defense, they deserve all the credit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nAD", "description": "Lamar Jackson runs wild and the defense dominates, just like in 2018.", "authors": ["Jonas Shaffer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y0Z8m05SrnkPVXWMWZz53aBtYKc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DUKPAYXOD4I6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
