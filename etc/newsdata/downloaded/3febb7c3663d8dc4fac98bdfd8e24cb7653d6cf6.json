She was brought to the shelter.\n\n\u201cShe was really nervous and needed a nail trim,\u201d said Torin Fisher, an admissions counselor with the shelter.\n\nBecause the dog was microchipped with the owner\u2019s information on it implanted, Fisher was able to contact Strang.\n\n\u201cThis amazing story unfolded, and here they are,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThis is why I love it. This is the whole reason I\u2019m here every day. Getting owners back with their pets is a great feeling. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nStrang surmises the dog got into someone\u2019s car because she likes to ride in vehicles and made the trip north\n\n\u201cShe had a tri-colored face the last time I saw her,\u201d Strang said about the brown, black and white colored dog. \u201cI bet she could tell me some stories.\u201d\n\nShe said she was shocked to find out the dog was alive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so happy to have her back. I cried so many nights without her,\u201d Strang told reporters. \u201cI was at work, and my son, who was 12 years old accidentally opened the door in the afternoon after school one day and we never saw her again.\u201d\n\nOnly 4 percent of stray animals brought to the shelter in 2018 had microchips, according to Humane Animal Rescue.\n\n\u201cI held out hope because I paid for that microchip every year,\u201d Strang said. \u201cIt was $15 a year, I wasn\u2019t going to give up hope for that. Always hope.\u201d\n\nStrang owns two other toy fox terriers.", "description": "Oct. 12 (UPI) \u2014 A 14-year-old toy fox terrier was reunited with its Florida owner in Pittsburgh after being missing for 12 years.
