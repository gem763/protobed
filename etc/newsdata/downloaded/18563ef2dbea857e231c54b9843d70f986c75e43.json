The bloody torso that is Brexit will this weekend dump itself in the torture chamber of the House of Commons. MPs will be asked to approve \u2013 in some fashion or other \u2013 the Brexit deal reached by Boris Johnson in Brussels. It is now surely clear that the deal comes as close as is feasible to a workable withdrawal from the EU, given the limitations set by the Commons since 2016. It also sets a framework for something quite separate, Britain\u2019s long-term relationship with the EU, which is yet to be negotiated in detail.\n\nJohnson won the Tory leadership by creating a problem for which there was by definition no solution. He would not just leave the EU but would replace its customs union with a \u201cfrictionless\u201d border in Ireland. There could be no such border, and Britain had no economic interest in having one. All the current chaos ensues from that. Despite his bluster, he has tried to avoid the greater lunacy of no deal. Faced with the impossibility of customs barriers, he has conceded a virtual border down the Irish Sea, regulatory alignment and a crazily bureaucratic scheme of tariff rebates. He is rumoured to have made concessions to die-hard unionists on abortion and subsidies. He has choked on a dozen promises, but he has eliminated the notorious backstop. In return, he has granted Belfast a veto on future trade deals.\n\nJohnson has deployed all his political charm to win over Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar and his own last-ditchers. The result is something of a coup. His deal is not permanent. It covers a withdrawal and a \u201cstandstill\u201d transition, but it must surely be last call for the UK\u2019s orderly departure from the EU, give or take some weeks of tidying up. A deal is done and on offer.\n\nAnd yet. At the last minute, the Democratic Unionist party has punched Johnson in the stomach. It is refusing to accept the deal, thus possibly denying him a Commons majority. This is despite opinion in the region strongly supporting continued trade links with the Republic. It means the DUP is on the brink of doing what Sinn F\u00e9in never achieved: turning majority opinion in the region in favour of reunification. The party is now demanding a specific unionists\u2019 veto in the Belfast assembly \u2013 not just an overall majority \u2013 on any new cross-border customs arrangement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The DUP\u2019s Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds: \u2018The party is now demanding a specific Unionists\u2019 veto in the Belfast assembly.\u2019 Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt beggars belief that the United Kingdom parliament can allow itself to be held to ransom by such absurdities. The way forward is for MPs from all other parties to back the deal, but it also beggars belief that elected politicians appear ready to reject it. These politicians voted for the Brexit referendum and voted to activate article 50. Yet Jeremy Corbyn has declared that Labour intends to support the DUP\u2019s rejectionism. His claim that the deal \u201cendangers the rights and protections of British workers\u201d is hooey. He just wants to embarrass Johnson.\n\nIf the DUP is right, and the deal risks Northern Ireland being drawn ever closer to the Republic, that is surely something Labour should welcome, not impede. Corbyn\u2019s reluctant backing for another referendum is more opaque. Whether the government might accept such an amendment in return for getting Labour votes on Saturday is unknown, though the gamble could be worth it. Polls show that the public is so fed up with Brexit it would probably vote in a second referendum for any deal, rather than no deal or remain. Otherwise Labour\u2019s position, as set out last night by Keir Starmer, is all over the shop. It mostly consists of objections to the political statement, which is for future negotiation and remains all to play for. Either way, Corbyn should see electoral advantage in allowing Johnson his moment of glory, clearing the decks of Brexit and aiming for an early general election.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats\u2019 opposition to the deal is equally bizarre. Rejecting it would let Johnson present himself as the only \u201corderly\u201d Brexiter in sight, the only one who sought to honour the will of the people. The Lib Dems would surrender their best opportunity in a generation of supplanting Labour as the responsible party of the left. The same goes for the Scottish Nationalists. Brexit has led to a surge in support for independence, but the SNP needs to solidify support at the polls, not stay party to this interminable squabble south of the border. Everyone needs Brexit off the table.\n\nJohnson has made manifold errors. Alienating 21 Tory MPs was crass. They should be helping him get MPs from across the parties behind the deal, freeing him from the DUP. Nor should he have fixated on the customs union, but rather relegated it to the transition period. It left the Northern Irish trap gaping to catch him, as it did Theresa May. The region\u2019s sectarianism returns time and again to haunt British politics. On the back of Brexit, it may yet complete the break-up of a no longer \u201cunited\u201d kingdom.\n\nThe DUP should not decide who rules Britain. MPs should vote for Johnson\u2019s deal, and those who dislike its details should save their fight for the transition. Exit now would at last draw the Brexit poison from daily politics. It would lift the threat of no deal, and hopefully open the door to a calmer negotiation of Britain\u2019s European future. It is time, surely, to end this agony.\n\n\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The DUP is again proving the fly in the Brexit ointment, but it should not be allowed to decide who rules Britain, says Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins", "authors": ["Simon Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00305e52eec054048b078e4a565f247392451089/0_222_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cbcb29a83193549106873d473f23101a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
