A showdown in bankruptcy court in White Plains could come as early as this week.\n\nRestructuring the company through bankruptcy was at the heart of a tentative settlement agreement reached last week between the company and thousands of cities and counties that have sued it in federal court for its role in the opioid epidemic. Twenty-four states and five United States territories have also accepted the agreement.\n\nPurdue\u2019s board of directors voted Sunday evening to approve the settlement in principle.\n\n\u201cThis unique framework for a comprehensive resolution will dedicate all of the assets and resources of Purdue for the benefit of the American public,\u201d Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, said in a statement. \u201cThis settlement framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation, and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis. \u201d", "description": "The filing is a centerpiece of an agreement to settle thousands of cases against the company for its role in the opioids crises.
