Miley queen-of-abs-and-fringes Cyrus has spent the last few months dominating headlines and minds with assorted relationship news. From ending her on and off decade-long relationship with Liam Hemsworth, to THAT very talked about kiss with Kaitlynn Carter, it's been a pure whirlwind.\n\nWell, of course, the latest news as of a few days ago, was about Miley's split from Kaitlynn, who after a mere summer together called it quits - reportedly this was Miley's call, as she wanted to spend more time focussed on her career. So, after a tumultuous summer full of break-up tattoos, PDAs at Lake Como and some -ahem- comments left on various Instagrams, Mil-lynn was officially finito.\n\nWell, imagine our shock then, when Miley posted last night about having met a \"potential new partner\". The group chat was ablaze. And then our Wifi kicked into gear and the pic loaded...\n\nOkay, so we can all calm down. Nothing too major going on here, except from a few awkward grimaces from exes (we assume).\n\nHowever, Miley also posted to her stories yesterday about being back in the studio, after The Sun reported that she was rewriting parts of her upcoming album after her break ups, to better reflect the changes in how she feels now.\n\nHer fans have been waiting for the second part of her album She is Coming (released in May) to drop this summer. The upcoming album will be called She is Miley Cyrus.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Ooooh it's a bit awkward \ud83d\ude2c", "authors": ["Daniella Scott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CXSflaAnb7Uy6CkfQnOJaA--~B/aD01MTM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/1bae3885eb82f5a5e6b7b950494f3514", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
