Twenty years later, the American physiologist Benjamin Libet used the Bereitschaftspotential to make the case not only that the brain shows signs of a decision before a person acts, but that, incredibly, the brain\u2019s wheels start turning before the person even consciously intends to do something. Suddenly, people\u2019s choices\u2014even a basic finger tap\u2014appeared to be determined by something outside of their own perceived volition.\n\nAs a philosophical question, whether humans have control over their own actions had been fought over for centuries before Libet walked into a lab. But Libet introduced a genuine neurological argument against free will. His finding set off a new surge of debate in science and philosophy circles. And over time, the implications have been spun into cultural lore.\n\nToday, the notion that our brains make choices before we are even aware of them will now pop up in cocktail-party conversation or in a review of Black Mirror. It\u2019s covered by mainstream journalism outlets, including This American Life, Radiolab, and this magazine. Libet\u2019s work is frequently brought up by popular intellectuals such as Sam Harris and Yuval Noah Harari to argue that science has proved humans are not the authors of their actions.\n\nIt would be quite an achievement for a brain signal 100 times smaller than major brain waves to solve the problem of free will. But the story of the Bereitschaftspotential has one more twist: It might be something else entirely.\n\nThe Bereitschaftspotential was never meant to get entangled in free-will debates. If anything, it was pursued to show that the brain has a will of sorts. The two German scientists who discovered it, a young neurologist named Hans Helmut Kornhuber and his doctoral student L\u00fcder Deecke, had grown frustrated with their era\u2019s scientific approach to the brain as a passive machine that merely produces thoughts and actions in response to the outside world. Over lunch in 1964, the pair decided that they would figure out how the brain works to spontaneously generate an action. \u201cKornhuber and I believed in free will,\u201d says Deecke, who is now 81 and lives in Vienna.\n\nTo pull off their experiment, the duo had to come up with tricks to circumvent limited technology. They had a state-of-the-art computer to measure their participants\u2019 brain waves, but it worked only after it detected a finger tap. So to collect data on what happened in the brain beforehand, the two researchers realized that they could record their participants\u2019 brain activity separately on tape, then play the reels backwards into the computer. This inventive technique, dubbed \u201creverse-averaging,\u201d revealed the Bereitschaftspotential.\n\nThe discovery garnered widespread attention. The Nobel laureate John Eccles and the prominent philosopher of science Karl Popper compared the study\u2019s ingenuity to Galileo\u2019s use of sliding balls for uncovering the laws of motion of the universe. With a handful of electrodes and a tape recorder, Kornhuber and Deecke had begun to do the same for the brain.", "description": "For decades, a landmark brain study fed speculation about whether we control our own actions.
