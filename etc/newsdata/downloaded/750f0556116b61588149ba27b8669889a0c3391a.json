We are truly sorry.\n\nWe are taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again. Safety of the flying public, our customers and the crews aboard our airplanes is always our top priority.\n\nThe 737 Max and its software are undergoing an unprecedented level of global regulatory oversight, testing and analysis. We updated the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System on the 737 Max by adding three additional layers of protection to prevent accidents like these from ever happening again. To date, we\u2019ve conducted over 800 test and production flights with the updated MCAS software, totaling more than 1,500 hours.\n\nWe are making a second software update that provides additional flight control computer redundancy. Some 545 participants from more than 140 customers and regulators globally, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, have participated in simulator sessions of the MCAS software update. Recently, we completed a dry-run certification flight test.\n\nWe are updating crew manuals and pilot training, designed to ensure every pilot has all of the information they need to fly the 737 Max safely.\n\nBoeing continues to work with the FAA and global regulators on the certification of the software update and training program to safely return the 737 Max to service.\n\nOUR VIEW:5 questions for Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg\n\nBoeing has also established a $100 million relief fund to meet family and community needs of those affected by these accidents. Fifty million dollars has been set aside for the Boeing Financial Assistance Fund, which is designed to provide immediate financial assistance to the families of the victims of the accidents.\n\nOur more than 150,000 Boeing people are unwavering in their commitment to our customers and our values, and the changes we\u2019re implementing now will further strengthen our approach to safety across our company and the aerospace community.\n\nDennis Muilenburg is president and CEO of Boeing.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.", "description": "Boeing continues to work with FAA and global regulators to safely return the 737 Max to service, writes Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing CEO and president", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/28/USAT/59001021-b370-495d-9ba9-c6b2b26fde7d-Boeing.oppose.jpg?crop=3572,2679,x0,y20&width=3200&height=2443&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
