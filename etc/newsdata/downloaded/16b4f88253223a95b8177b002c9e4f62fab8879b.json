Here's what we watched:\n\nREVENUE FORECAST: Revenue fell 23% to $14.7 billion, against FactSet analyst poll that was looking for $16.04 billion.\n\nNET INCOME FORECAST: Equinor posted a net loss of $1.11 billion, down from a profit of $1.67 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected net profit of $1.06 billion. Adjusted earnings fell 46% to $2.59 billion against expectations of $2.68 billion. It posted net impairments of $2.79 billion, provisions of $560 million and changes in fair value of derivatives and inventory hedge contracts of $444 million, with a positive gain from sale of assets of $849 million. Provisions and impairments were related to damage at its South Riding Point oil terminal in the Bahamas, in addition to onerous contract provisions in North America, it said.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH:\n\nPRODUCTION AND PRICES: Equinor said its earnings were weighed by lower average prices and lower volumes for both liquids and gas, in addition to impairment losses, mainly related to unconventional onshore assets in North America. In response, the Norwegian oil-and-gas major said it will now defer gas production to periods with higher expected prices. Equinor delivered total equity production of 1.909 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the third quarter, down from 2.066 million barrels a day in 2018. A FactSet poll expected total production in the third quarter at 1.901 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.\n\nGUIDANCE: The company still expects exploration spending of around $1.7 billion and production around the 2018 level. For the 2019 to 2025 period, production growth is still expected from new projects, resulting in a compound annual growth rate of around 3%. Full-year organic capital expenditure is still seen at $10 billion to $11 billion.\n\nWrite to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 08:58 ET (12:58 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
