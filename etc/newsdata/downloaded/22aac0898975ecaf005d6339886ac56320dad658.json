He should have been sent off when it counted. It defined the game. It cost Fiji the match.\n\nTo make matters worse, the incident was seen by on-field referee Ben O\u2019Keefe, who referred it to Television Match Official Rowan Kitt, and between the two of them they decided there was no case to answer.\n\nCome on guys, you can do better than that.\n\nThere has been some scaremongering in recent years about rugby\u2019s drive to reduce a concussion epidemic which threatened to make the game unviable if it went unchecked.\n\nThose who believe almost anything should go on the field argued rugby would go soft by addressing head injuries while the same macho willy wavers mocked attempts to introduce safety measures aimed at protecting players.\n\nMercifully those arguments have long since been lost and there is now a genuine and determined belief among enough people who count in the sport that head-high tackling should be confined to history and referees should be empowered to send players off who don\u2019t play ball.\n\nTo simplify matters and make referees, spectators and players lives easier, a tick-box chart was introduced following a World Rugby player welfare symposium held in Paris last March following the deaths of four French players in a year, which leads us through the decision-making process for potentially dangerous tackles.\n\nEssentially it goes thus; is there contact with the head? Is there an attempt to wrap the arms around the opponent\u2019s body? Are there any mitigating circumstances?\n\nIf the answer is \u201cyes\u201d to the first two and no to the third then the referee has no option but to show a red card.\n\nIgnore all the noise around games being spoiled and look at the cool hard facts. Hodge\u2019s concussion-inducing hit ticked every box and by failing to send him off, O\u2019Keefe and his team made a mockery of months of work to educate all involved in the sport that these sort of head shots are no longer acceptable.\n\nIt was in plain sight. It ticked every box. It should have been red. Sorry, no excuses.\n\nTo rub salt in the wound for Fiji, the magnificent Yato played no further part in the game and will inevitably miss their next game against Uruguay on Wednesday.\n\nHodge went on to score a try as Australia pulled clear in the second half. He should not have been on the field. If he hadn\u2019t been, Fiji may well have won.\n\nThe referee\u2019s failure to implement the laws surrounding high tackles caused the controversy. Nothing more, nothing less. You can hardly blame World Rugby if the officials don\u2019t do their job.\n\nFor all the pre-tournament talk around player welfare, O\u2019Keefe and his officials got it horribly wrong in Sapporo on Saturday.\n\nSunday morning\u2019s citing was too little, too late. By not showing a red on the field for such a clear breach of the laws, confusion now reigns where there should have been clarity.\n\nOn so many occasions refereeing rugby union is hard. So many decisions to make, so little time.\n\nBut in this case it was simple. The officials failed to spot what was clear for all to see and Fiji, and Yato, paid a heavy price.", "description": "If you have ever played, watched or reported on rugby union you will have sympathy for the referees.
