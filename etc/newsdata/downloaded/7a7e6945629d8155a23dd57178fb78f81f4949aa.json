And polls suggest that the public is tuning out the Trump administration\u2019s daily reality-TV dramas.\n\nBut regardless of whether the Ukraine scandal remains front-page news, it will haunt the U.S. intelligence community, which has been Trump\u2019s b\u00eate noire since the day he took office.\n\nDesperate to demonstrate his own power and accomplishments, Trump will be even less careful with classified information in the runup to the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has relentlessly attacked U.S. intelligence agencies, cozied up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and divulged secrets to foreign officials, potentially burning high-value sources. This behavior had already raised serious concerns about whether Trump can be trusted to receive sensitive intelligence at all.\n\nNow, intelligence leaders must ask themselves how far they are willing to go in toeing the White House line. That\u2019s even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nRead: Why Trump impeachment threat is now rattling stock-market investors\n\nDisclosure to Congress\n\nThere is no question that the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IGIC), Michael K. Atkinson, made the right call when he recommended that the whistleblower complaint be disclosed to Congress. Such referrals are his prerogative by law, and a decade of legal precedent further supports the decision.\n\nNonetheless, the acting director of national intelligence (DNI), Joseph Maguire, is blocking the IGIC\u2019s referral, claiming that it does not involve \u201curgent\u201d intelligence, and instead concerns privileged \u2014 meaning, presidential \u2014 communications.\n\nWith the administration and Congress at loggerheads and investigations into Trump\u2019s behavior expanding, more White House denials, duplicity, and foot-dragging are certain, as are attacks on the intelligence community. In firing up his base for the 2020 campaign, Trump will use the whistleblower complaint to support his claims that a mythical \u201cdeep state\u201d is out to get him.\n\nIndeed, he has already dismissed the whistleblower as a \u201cpartisan,\u201d questioning the official\u2019s patriotism. The name-calling echoes his broader campaign of character assassination against former intelligence and law-enforcement officials. Active-duty intelligence professionals have good reason to expect that they will soon be back in his sights, too.\n\nBrain drain\n\nTrump\u2019s antipathy toward intelligence agencies has far-reaching implications for U.S. national security. The DNI, the country\u2019s top intelligence job, remains unfilled; if history is any guide, more senior officials will depart before the 2020 election, leaving further vacancies.\n\nMoreover, Trump has increasingly sought to fill key national-security positions with politically loyal stooges such as John Ratcliffe, a junior congressman whose nomination to serve as DNI was withdrawn following revelations that he had falsified his resume.\n\nThe 2020 campaign will make matters even worse for the intelligence community. Desperate to demonstrate his own power and accomplishments, Trump will be even less careful with classified information. In 2017, he compromised a sensitive Israeli intelligence operation in Syria by bragging about what he knew to visiting Russian diplomats.\n\nAnd just last month, he taunted Iran by tweeting a highly classified image from a U.S. spy satellite, complete with detailed annotations of a missile failure at an Iranian test site. As private-sector analysts immediately pointed out, the image will be of immense value to U.S. adversaries.\n\nU.S. spies do not \u2014 indeed, cannot \u2014 trust Trump. Earlier this month, we learned from multiple sources the CIA was forced to exfiltrate an exceptionally valuable Russian asset from Moscow in 2017, among other things, owing to concerns that Trump might jeopardize that individual\u2019s safety.\n\nIgnoring U.S. interests\n\nThe Ukraine scandal reinforces those concerns, because it suggests that Trump will not hesitate to ignore the interests of U.S. allies and intelligence partners when it suits his political interests.\n\nThe White House\u2019s mysterious decision to withhold nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine at the same time that it was pressuring Zelensky is just the latest example of this.\n\nTrump has also dismissed North Korea\u2019s ongoing short-range missile tests as irrelevant, even though U.S., South Korean, and Japanese intelligence analysts see them as evidence of the North\u2019s growing capacity to launch strikes against Japan and South Korea (and against American forces stationed in both countries).\n\nThe Ukraine affair also offers an early indication of how Trump will deal with intelligence that threatens his prospects for re-election.\n\nAttorney General William Barr\u2019s official probe into the origins of the 2016 inquiry into Russian election interference exemplifies the White House effort to intimidate intelligence officials, presumably with the hope they will downplay their investigations of Russia\u2019s continuing meddling. U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies \u2014 including the FBI in a major report last month \u2014 have warned that Russian attacks on the 2020 election are already in the works.\n\nSuch findings put these agencies directly at odds with Trump, who still refuses to acknowledge that the Kremlin aided his 2016 campaign.\n\nImportant precedent\n\nIn the final analysis, the intelligence community\u2019s ability to fulfill its proper function under such conditions will depend on its leaders.\n\nIt has been almost a half-century since former CIA Director William Colby opened that agency\u2019s files to congressional investigators, following allegations that it had been engaged in prohibited spying. Although his decision was controversial at the time, we now know that it preserved the intelligence community by creating an effective system of oversight.\n\nColby used to carry a miniature copy of the U.S. Constitution with him wherever he went. In his view, the CIA was an integral part of American democracy, which relies on checks and balances. That is one message that the intelligence community can still make loud and clear \u2014 and without fearing that anyone\u2019s cover will be blown.\n\nKent Harrington, a former senior CIA analyst, served as National Intelligence Officer for East Asia, Chief of Station in Asia, and the CIA\u2019s Director of Public Affairs.\n\nThis article was published with the permission of Project Syndicate.", "description": "The president will follow his playbook of lashing out at his enemies, claiming the existence of a \u2018deep state\u2019 and rallying his base for support.", "authors": ["Kent Harrington"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR982_trump__MG_20190924181259.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
