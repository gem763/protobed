For example, Ari Cohn, the former director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, told The Washington Examiner:\n\nThe First Amendment does not and cannot sanction prohibiting words simply because they are subjectively used to \u201cdegrade\u201d or \u201cdemean.\u201d If the word \u201cbitch\u201d can be outlawed when used to demean, why can\u2019t \u201cMAGA\u201d or \u201cliberal\u201d? Going down the road Rep. Hunt proposes would expose to prosecution nearly all of the speech that the First Amendment was meant to protect.\n\nJim Manley, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation (which litigates free-speech issues), told Reason something similar:\n\nAs the Supreme Court has said there\u2019s no happy talk requirement in the First Amendment. You cannot ban a word when it\u2019s used to annoy someone but let them use the word when they are using the word in a positive way.\n\n\u201cLegislatures can\u2019t just pluck words out of the dictionary and ban them,\u201d he said.\n\nBasically, the consensus is clear that this would not \u2014 and could not \u2014 ever become law, but honestly, I still find myself disturbed by the fact that it was even discussed in the legislature in the first place. After all, this means that the public servants in Massachusetts actually have so little knowledge of the Constitution (which the taxpayers are paying them to protect) that they spent their (taxpayer-funded) time earnestly considering it.\n\nMost of my columns at National Review focus on PC culture, and sometimes, when I write about some idiotic, anti-free-speech idea presented by some idiotic, anti-free-speech student or professor, people will ask me why I wasted my time writing about it. After all, these critics allege, it was just a random opinion from some ultra-progressive fringe moron; it\u2019s not like it has any real impact on society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, news like this proves that to be false. According to Boston.com, this bill \u201creportedly came at the request of an unidentified constituent.\u201d If people unconcerned about those who openly lobby against the First Amendment on the grounds that they don\u2019t have any real influence or impact were correct, it would have stopped there. The request would have been ignored, written off as nothing more than the whack-a-doo view of some fringe-left uber-progressive who doesn\u2019t understand the Constitution, and never discussed again.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what happened.\n\nIt\u2019s terrifying, but it\u2019s true: A sincere proposal to criminalize a word was formally considered at the highest level of a state\u2019s government. Someone was advocating for blatantly unconstitutional censorship not just in some classroom in Berkeley, Calif., but in an official capacity at a state\u2019s capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe good news is, I truly believe that most people would disagree with this kind of law. I truly do believe that. At the same time, though, when we see something like this, we cannot say that the super-woke, censorship-happy aren\u2019t having any influence. They are, and it\u2019s up to us sane people to fight against this toxic, draconian line of thinking whenever we see it. After all, living in a country without freedom of speech as a check against government power would be more than just kind of a bitch.", "description": "On Tuesday, Massachusetts legislators considered a bill that would criminalize certain uses of the word \u201cbitch\u201d -- making it punishable by up to six months in jail or a fine up to $200.", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
