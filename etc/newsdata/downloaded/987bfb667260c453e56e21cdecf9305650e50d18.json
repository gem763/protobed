This week two of Giuliani\u2019s associates in that effort were arrested on charges of violating federal campaign finance laws.\n\nA whistleblower complaint, which sparked the formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, refers to Giuliani 31 times. It paints a picture of a lawyer who in the service of his old friend and now personal client \u2013 Trump \u2013 allegedly circumvented national security protocols as he travelled between Washington and Kyiv carrying private orders from the president, many of dubious legality.\n\nTrump-Ukraine impeachment scandal: timeline of key events Read more\n\nA separate report by the Bloomberg agency this week said Trump pressured Tillerson to help persuade the justice department to drop a criminal case against Zarrab. \u201cTillerson refused, arguing it would constitute interference in an ongoing investigation of the trader,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cTillerson immediately repeated his objections to then-Chief of Staff John Kelly in a hallway conversation just outside the Oval Office, emphasizing that the request would be illegal,\u201d the report said.\n\nGiuliani told Bloomberg earlier this month: \u201cSuppose I did talk to Trump about it \u2013 so what? I was a private lawyer at the time. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe at some point I dropped his name in a conversation. Or maybe one of his people talked to him about it because I was trying to do a prisoner swap.\u201d\n\nAnd in an interview with the New York Times, he compared his efforts to the spy exchanges that took place during the cold war. \u201cIt happened to be a good trade,\u201d he said. \u201cI expected to be a hero like in a Tom Hanks movie.\u201d\n\nEd Pilkington contributed to this report", "description": "Giuliani, at 2017 Oval Office meeting, pushed for alleged fraudster Reza Zarrab to be released as part of prisoner swap with Turkey", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ef49f475151fefa80642aec6fcbf7163724dcc1/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e864339182feb6a1884048010b77a5f2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
