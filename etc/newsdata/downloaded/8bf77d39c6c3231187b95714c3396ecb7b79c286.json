The couple have three children, ages 10 months to 15 years, so they know what it's like to be pressed for time.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things we learned is that there\u2019s a major difference between a seller\u2019s agent and a buyer\u2019s agent and what they\u2019re good at,\u201d says Michael, a financial adviser and partner with the C. Curtis Financial Group in Plymouth, Michigan.\n\nHe warns against using one agent to represent both sides in a transaction, known as dual agency, even if the agent discloses the relationship.\n\nReal estate investing: Is buying an investment property right for you?

Betsy Twigg, a realtor with McEnearney Associates in Arlington, Virginia, suggests asking another real estate agent besides your own for recommendations.\n\n\u201cEveryone is trying to monetize everything in real estate these days,\u201d says Twigg, who has been in the business for nearly 30 years. \u201cSometimes an agent gets money directly from a referral, owns a stake in a title company or just gets a financial benefit in the form of free advertising or the supplies for an open house for brokers. Consumers should ask their agent about whether they get any compensation from their relationship with the professionals they\u2019re referring.\u201d\n\nTips for finding pros\n\nWebsites with consumer reviews make it easier to shop for a pro even when you\u2019re in a crunch, DiClerico says.\n\nHere are the professionals you\u2019ll need in addition to a real estate agent:\n\nMortgage lender: Most buyers get preapproval for a loan before they shop for a home, Twigg says, but they\u2019re not obligated to stick with that loan or lender.\n\n\u201cMost contracts give you seven days to shop for a loan, so I recommend that buyers get quotes from at least three lenders after they have a signed purchase contract,\u201d she says.\n\nReal estate agents typically recommend a lender who they know will be most likely to get the loan closed, Brasler says, but that doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019re getting the best rate and terms, which is why shopping for a loan is so important.\n\nHome inspector Joe Mazza checks the hinges of a garage door. Mazza recommends all homes have a fire-rated garage door that automatically shuts to isolate the garage from the remainder of the home. (Photo: USA Today)\n\nHome inspector: Research from Consumers' Checkbook found two issues with home inspectors: some who do very little work and some who find an abundance of issues that aren\u2019t really problems, Brasler says.\n\n\u201cAgents don\u2019t want the deal killed, but they\u2019re not operating for their clients\u2019 best interests if they recommend an inspector who doesn\u2019t do a lot of work,\u201d Brasler says.\n\nWindle shopped for his own home inspector based on friends\u2019 recommendations and requested sample reports to compare their work. DiClerico suggests reading reviews, checking for certifications and accreditation and interviewing several home inspectors.\n\nTitle company/real estate attorney: Brasler says buyers should contact at least three recommended title companies and choose one based on their rates and reviews. He suggests asking if they have an attorney on the staff who would assist you if an issue arose.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to use the title company your agent recommends because if they have a good relationship, there may be a benefit in scheduling and getting things done,\u201d Windle says.\n\nCristina Colacci became a real estate agent to help buy her house while juggling $60,000 in student loans.
