An emeritus professor of Japanese and Korean history at the Australian National University, she has been working on an essay examining the heated language that Navarro employs, noting its similarity to talk of a \u201cyellow peril\u201d at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nIn her research, she kept running across a name she didn\u2019t recognize: Ron Vara. Navarro has quoted Vara a dozen or so times in six books, usually as an epigraph before a chapter. In Death by China, published in 2011, Vara offers this sweeping assessment of the country\u2019s roughly 1.4 billion people: \u201cOnly the Chinese can turn a leather sofa into an acid bath, a baby crib into a lethal weapon, and a cellphone battery into heart-piercing shrapnel.\u201d\n\nSo who is Ron Vara? He didn\u2019t seem to exist except in the work of Peter Navarro. The most information Morris-Suzuki could find came from Navarro\u2019s 2001 book, If It\u2019s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks (McGraw-Hill). In that book, which lays out Navarro\u2019s plan for how to profit by paying attention to bad news, the reader learns that Vara was a \u201cstruggling doctoral student in economics\u201d at Harvard in the mid-1980s, slogging away on a thesis about utilities regulation.\n\nMorris-Suzuki, now in full detective mode, sent emails to some colleagues at Harvard, but no one could turn up any record of Vara.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tom Bartlett", "Chronicle.Com Interactives Key"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
