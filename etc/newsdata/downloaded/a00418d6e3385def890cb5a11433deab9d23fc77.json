It\u2019s difficult,\u201d said Vahaamahina, holding back tears, to his team-mates in the dressing room in a video posted on French broadcaster TF1\u2019s website. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s indefensible.\u201d\n\n\u2013 French flair returns \u2013\n\nOne silver lining for France was the sparkling rugby they produced at the start of the match that led to a fine trio of tries.\n\nSome of the midfield running and passing was a throwback to the best of French rugby traditions and far removed from their lumbering style of recent times.\n\nToulouse half-backs Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack are both in their early 20s, while the quick duo of Virimi Vakatawa and Damian Penaud should both have several more years of Test rugby ahead of them as well.\n\n\u2013 Get your kicks \u2013\n\nHaving a goalkicker with a match success rate of less than 80 percent is asking for trouble. While you could argue that Ntamack was unlucky to see a first-half conversion and penalty hit the post, the two eminently kickable chances should not really have been anywhere near the woodwork.\n\nAs it was, the five points spurned proved crucial to the outcome.\n\n\u2013 Find a way to win \u2013\n\nIt wasn\u2019t pretty but knockout games are all about the result and the fact Wales were able to win without being anywhere near their best should give them a degree of confidence heading into a semi-final with South Africa.\n\nWales are unlikely to get away with another slow start against the Springboks in a match where they will hope to have centre Jonathan Davies, much missed in defence during the France match, fit following a knee injury.\n\n\u2013 Ref in bother \u2013\n\nThat referee Jaco Peyper needed to consult the television match official before showing a red card, after failing to spot Vahaamahina\u2019s clear hit on Wainwright himself, might have given the South African pause for thought.\n\nBut it did not stop Peyper apparently being photographed later with celebrating Wales fans while appearing to mimic Vahaamahina\u2019s elbow shot.\n\nCritics said this cast doubt on his neutrality and judgement, two qualities vital to the success of any referee.\n\nWorld Rugby said it was \u201cestablishing the facts\u201d before commenting further.", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Wales made it into the last four of the World Cup with a dramatic come from behind 20-19 win over 14-man France.
