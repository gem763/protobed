Last year, after the Capitals won their first Stanley Cup, Trump invited the team to visit the Oval Office and allowed reporters in to mark the occasion, but he did not preside over a formal ceremony.\n\nAD\n\nThe visit of the Blues included a host of dignitaries, including Republican members of Congress from their home state of Missouri. Among them was Rep. Billy Long, a trained auctioneer, who at Trump\u2019s request took the lectern for a mock auction of the Stanley Cup.\n\nThe winning \u201cbid\u201d was $65,000. Long then asked Trump to sign his tie, noting another tie signed by the president during the State of the Union address fetched $15,000 in an auction for charity.\n\nAD\n\nThe Blues players, coaches and team owner Tom Stillman took their positions behind the presidential lectern, but they had to wait a bit for Trump to turn his full attention to them. The president, making his first public appearance of the day, used the top of his remarks to defend his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, announcing that Vice President Pence plans to leave Wednesday for the region to try to broker a cease fire to stop Turkey\u2019s assault on Kurdish forces that have marked the U.S. pullback.\n\nAD\n\nTrump also hailed improvements in the stock market, suggesting the markets were buoyed by his announcement last week of a partial trade deal with China \u2014 a deal that has yet to be finalized.\n\nOnce he did focus on the Blues, Trump appeared to be in good spirits. He called center Alexander Steen, who is missing a tooth, to the lectern to praise his toughness (\u201cYou think I could take him in a fight?\u201d), and he offered a kiss on the cheek to Laila Anderson, an 11-year-old who suffers from a rare immune disorder and who became an inspiration to the team.\n\nAD\n\nTrump also jokingly suggested that Stillman, who worked in the Commerce Department three decades ago, return to federal government service.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sticking with hockey,\u201d Stillman replied with a chuckle.\n\nThe Blues arrived in Washington during a lengthy East Coast swing, which also included a Monday night trip to Nationals Park to root for the Cardinals, just as the Cardinals had for them during their Stanley Cup run. (The Blues left disappointed, with the Nats taking a 3-0 lead in the National League Championship Series with an 8-1 win.)\n\nAD\n\nThe hockey and baseball teams in St. Louis and Washington have long been intertwined. The Nationals cheered on the Capitals as they won the 2018 Stanley Cup and now, with the Nationals in the NLCS, the Caps are returning the favor. The fates aligned for the Blues to do the same in Washington; after a 3-2 overtime loss to the Islanders on Monday, they made it to D.C. for the 7:38 p.m. first pitch.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy when you look at it,\u201d Blues goalie Jake Allen told The Athletic. \u201cIt could be a great opportunity for us as a team to do that and support our fellow St. Louisans. It\u2019s pretty ironic that we\u2019re in a city that we actually don\u2019t have a game in, with nothing going on, to be able to make this happen. For us, things like that don\u2019t really line up on the road during the year \u2014 ever \u2014 so it\u2019s pretty ironic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s some cross-pollination, too. T.J. Oshie, the Capitals right winger who formerly played for the Blues, rooted for his former team to win the Stanley Cup after the Caps were eliminated and he has a sweet little bet going with Barret Jackman, the retired Blues defenseman. The loser has to treat the winner to golf and dinner.\n\nRead more on sports from The Post:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "A four-game East Coast swing offered the NHL champions the chance to swing by the White House (and to take in a baseball game, too).", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/exvRYn7W8bJbHIiHcrXC_1R94nY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/57LDJCHPRUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
