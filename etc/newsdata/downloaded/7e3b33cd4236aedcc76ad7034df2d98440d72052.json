The attacker was killed after stabbing four people to death.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor says the attacker was likely in contact with members of an ultra-conservative Islamic movement.\n\nSpeaking on TF1 television, Castaner said \"clearly there were malfunctions,\" without elaborating. He said the attacker had an \"altercation\" with colleagues earlier about the deadly 2015 Islamic extremist attack on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, but his colleagues didn't press for any action against him.\n\nCastaner also dismissed calls for his resignation over the slayings.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
