Her new book, Save Me the Plums: My Gourmet Memoir, chronicles her 10-year tenure as the editor-in-chief of Gourmet magazine.\n\nGourmet had been around since the '40s, but shuttered in 2009 right as advertisers began tightening their belts during the recession. Ten years before that, it was a different story: money was flowing. When Reichl signed on to the magazine in 1999, she was offered a personal driver, a clothing allowance, and a private dining room in her office, complete with its own bathroom.\n\nReichl brought a new perspective to the magazine that turned food writing on its head. She joined q's Tom Power to explain how being an outsider and a novice in the world of food writing was the key to reinvigorating and revamping Gourmet.\n\n\u2014 Produced by \u200bDiane Eros", "description": "Ruth Reichl joins Tom Power to talk about her new memoir, Save Me the Plums, which chronicles her 10-year tenure as the editor-in-chief of Gourmet magazine.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5129960.1557430854!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ruth-reichl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-10"}
