But the devil is in the details, and to date, those details are few and far between.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cWith Alexa Political Contributions you can donate to participating 2020 U.S. presidential campaigns by simply saying \u201cAlexa, I want to make a political contribution\u201d or \u201cAlexa, donate [amount] to [candidate name]\u201d. Amazon Pay will process the donation using the information and default payment method stored in your Amazon account and will email you a receipt for your records,\u201d the company wrote on its website to announce the program.\n\n\"To donate to a political campaign using Alexa you must be at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen or lawfully admitted permanent resident (i.e., green card holder); you must not be a federal government contractor; your contribution must be made in your own name and from your own funds, and funds must not be provided to you by another person or entity for the purpose of making the contribution; and you must make the contribution with your own personal payment method and not with a corporate or business payment instrument or a payment instrument issued to another person,\" the company wrote.\n\nThe risks\n\nIt remains unclear what, exactly, Amazon will do with all the data, how it plans to protect it from being hacked or compromised, and whether it will be possible for foreign adversaries to make fake Amazon accounts to tip the scales in favor of their preferred candidate.\n\nUntil Amazon provides clear answers to these questions, all presidential candidates for 2020 should take a principled stance against accepting donations made through Amazon\u2019s Alexa-powered devices.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that lowering the barrier for voters to contribute to the candidate or candidates of their choice is a good thing. And on the surface, it might seem like this is what Amazon is doing by enabling those with Alexa devices to donate by simply saying the word.\n\nThey can just shout to Alexa, who\u2019s always listening and waiting to be told what to do, and the money is automatically taken from an individual\u2019s bank account or credit card and sent to the desired campaign.\n\nBut consider the fact that Amazon, which has faced scrutiny over its privacy protections, will know not only its customers\u2019 favorite brand of toothpaste but also their favorite presidential candidates.\n\nThe information that can be derived from Alexa-enabled political donations goes beyond just which candidates are bringing in more donor money. By knowing when a customer makes a donation, Amazon can potentially cross-reference that to news events or statements made in debates. In other words, Amazon will be able to learn what motivates customers to donate and what issues those customers care about.\n\nHow can we know that Amazon isn\u2019t going to sell that sensitive and highly valuable information to the highest bidder, or trade it for more user data from another unscrupulous Big Tech platform?\n\nMany Facebook users thought the information they put on the platform was only being used for targeting ads until news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. Actual political donation data could be even more dangerous in the hands of bad actors.\n\nAnd how can we know that Amazon \u2013 which spent more than $14 million on lobbying and over $13 million in political contributions in 2018 \u2013 won\u2019t use all of that political spending data to shape its own political spending strategy the way the company uses sales data to shape its marketing and product development?\n\nA Prime account only costs $12.99 a month, a pittance to a nation intent on meddling in our elections. - -John Burnett, managing director and founder of consulting firm 1 Empire Group\n\nEven without a team of government-backed hackers on their side, foreign parties may be able to manipulate this new Alexa feature through basic steps to mask their location and true identity, creating multiple \u2013 even thousands \u2013 of Amazon accounts for the purposes of donating to a candidate and influencing elections. A Prime account only costs $12.99 a month, a pittance to a nation intent on meddling in our elections.\n\nAt a time when our country is grappling with ways to protect the integrity of our electoral process from foreign interference, it is critical that we think long and hard about how Amazon-enabled political donations could open up a Pandora\u2019s box of meddling.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nPut simply, the danger of voters\u2019 political contributions data falling into the hands of Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, or just malicious actors within the United States should alarm everyone. Candidates should stand up for privacy and democracy and refuse to accept contributions made through Amazon.\n\nJohn Burnett is the managing director and founder of 1 Empire Group, a consulting firm specializing in business analytics and development, operations, process re-engineering, growth strategies, risk management and public affairs.\n\nDisclosure: I hold a long position in Amazon and I do not have plans to initiate any positions or transactions in Amazon in the near future.
