Both parties could struggle to form a majority coalition with smaller allies, though, forcing them into a potential unity government.\n\nIt\u2019s the second election this year, after Netanyahu failed to build a coalition following April\u2019s vote and dissolved parliament.\n\nPolling stations opened at 7 a.m. and exit polls are expected at the end of the voting day at 10 p.m. Official results are projected to come in overnight.\n\nWith his political career on the line, Netanyahu has campaigned furiously and taken a late hard turn to the right. He\u2019s staged a flurry of media appearances to beseech supporters to vote in large numbers to stave off the prospect of a left-wing government he says will endanger the country\u2019s security.\n\nA centerpiece of his late-hour agenda has been the pledge to extend Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank and to annex all the Jewish settlements there, something Netanyahu has refrained from doing during his decade-plus in power.\n\nThe proposal sparked a cascade of international condemnation, including from Europe and Saudi Arabia, an influential Arab country that has quiet, unofficial ties with Israel. The U.S., however, had a muted reaction, suggesting Netanyahu coordinated his plan with the Americans ahead of time.\n\nHe\u2019s also been flaunting his close ties to President Donald Trump and the prospect of a defense pact between their countries shortly after the election.\n\nGantz is offering himself as an honest alternative to the scandal-plagued Netanyahu and his narrow coalition of ultranationalist and ultra-religious parties. Campaigning on rhetoric of unity and egalitarianism, Gantz says he represents a fresh start for Israel and has ruled out joining forces with a prime minister accused of serious crimes.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attorney general has recommended pressing criminal charges against Netanyahu in three separate corruption cases, pending a long delayed pretrial hearing scheduled for early October \u2014 just three weeks after the election.\n\n", "description": "He\u2019s facing a stiff challenge, again, from Benny Gantz.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/43/08/b1ef5a1b41d49bce1b64ee662664/webp.net-resizeimage%20(26).jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
