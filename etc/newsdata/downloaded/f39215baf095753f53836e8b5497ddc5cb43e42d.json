In an email, a Florida corrections spokesman explained that some offer \u201ceasy to use templates for tattooing,\u201d which is prohibited because of the risk of transmitting diseases. Foreign (and fictional) language dictionaries, meanwhile, can pose a security threat \u201cby providing a method of communication not readily identifiable by security staff.\u201d\n\nThe same books might be perfectly fine in another state. If that sounds arbitrary, it is. \u201cThere is a serious nationwide need for better standards and oversight in what prisoners are allowed to read,\u201d says Michelle Dillon, public records manager and development coordinator for the Human Rights Defense Center, a prisoners\u2019 rights organization based in Lake Worth, Fla. The group, which also runs Prison Legal News, a monthly magazine for inmates, published the Florida banned books list in July, as part of a larger effort to obtain similar lists from the Federal Bureau of Prisons and each state correctional system.\n\nSo far, the center has compiled full or partial lists from 20 states, not including publicly available lists for Pennsylvania and Washington state. Based on the group\u2019s findings, the worst places for incarcerated readers include Texas \u2014 which made headlines in 2017 after it banned \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d but not Hitler\u2019s autobiographical manifesto, \u201cMein Kampf\u201d \u2014 as well as Arizona and Florida.\n\nIn Florida, prisoners can appeal a publication\u2019s impoundment or rejection in the mail room by filing a grievance to the Literature Review Committee, a group of three prison officials that meets every two weeks; their decisions form the banned books list. But in Alabama and many other states, no systemwide review committee exists.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last 30 years is a dramatic clampdown,\u201d says HRDC executive director Paul Wright, who founded the group after successfully challenging book bans as an inmate in Washington state. \u201cEspecially looking at self-help books. It almost harks back to the days of slavery, when it was illegal for slaves to learn to read or write, and a crime for anyone to teach them.\u201d\n\nHis organization recently won a lawsuit against the Southwest Virginia Regional Jail Authority, which had required preapproval for all publications and barred HRDC magazines because the staples could be used as weapons or \u201ctattooing guns.\u201d But battles in the judicial system don\u2019t always go their way. In January, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of a case in which the group had unsuccessfully sued to overturn a ban on Prison Legal News in Florida jails. Officials argued that the publication\u2019s advertisements, including for three-way phone-calling services, posed a security risk.\n\nMost prisons do have libraries, which are often so underfunded and understaffed that inmates rely on reading material mailed by friends, family or nonprofits such as the Seattle-based Books to Prisoners. The organization sends about 12,000 packages each year to inmates asking for novels, dictionaries, Spanish-language textbooks and the like, amid byzantine prison regulations on what can be delivered.\n\nSome of the rules, of course, make intuitive sense. Manuals on lock picking or improvised explosives are prohibited for obvious reasons. But plenty of the regulations are more questionable \u2014 or at least have unfortunate consequences. Many prisons ban hardcover books over fears that drugs might be hidden inside. And most states have strict rules on sexual content, leading to bans on art-history guides or works of literature like \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d by Alice Walker and \u201cI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\u201d by Maya Angelou.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring example of prison censorship has been the rejection of books about criminal justice reform, mass incarceration and inmates\u2019 rights. In a country where, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, black men serve prison sentences at nearly six times the rate of white men, books like Howard O. Lindsey\u2019s \u201cA History of Black America\u201d and Henry Louis Gates Jr.\u2019s \u201cFinding Oprah\u2019s Roots\u201d have repeatedly run afoul of censors.\n\n\u201cChokehold: Policing Black Men\u201d by Paul Butler was banned in Arizona prisons until June, weeks after the American Civil Liberties Union threatened a lawsuit, and Michelle Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d a searing indictment of mass incarceration, was off-limits to prisoners in North Carolina, Florida and New Jersey before bans were lifted amid similar challenges by the ACLU. (Once again, \u201csecurity\u201d was cited to justify the bans. The New York Times reported that \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d was barred from North Carolina prisons because officials determined it was \u201clikely to provoke confrontation between racial groups.\u201d)\n\nSuch books have proved transformative for readers like Jesse Dunaway, 38, whom I connected with through FAMM, an advocacy group that was formerly known as Families Against Mandatory Minimums. He began reading \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d while in solitary confinement about five years ago, a decade into a life sentence for selling crack cocaine. \u201cIt woke me up,\u201d he said by phone from Sussex II State Prison in Virginia. \u201cIt pretty much took me on a course where I\u2019m fighting for my freedom\u201d \u2014 that is, filing a petition for clemency.\n\nIf Dunaway is ever released, he will be one of the 95 percent of prisoners who eventually return home. \u201cYou have to ask yourself, \u2018What kind of people do you want in your own community once they\u2019re released?\u2019 \u201d says Dillon. \u201cDo you want people who have had access to these materials to expand their minds, or people who have had materials withheld from them for the past five, 10, 20 years?\u201d\n\nMore from the Magazine:\n\nAre goats the new weed whackers?
