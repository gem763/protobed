They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst. They don\u2019t have people like that,\u201d he said. It was a dig at the Republican senator from Utah who has been increasingly critical of the president.\n\nAfter a rocky week when fellow Republicans broke with the president for withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria and deciding to host a Group of Seven summit at his resort in Miami \u2014 the latter move quickly rescinded \u2014 the White House went back to basics Monday. Several of the president\u2019s advisers highlighted strong economic news in the Cabinet meeting.\n\nWhite House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow talked of a \u201cmiddle-class boom.\u201d He cited data from the private firm Sentier Research that median household income has risen about $5,000 under Mr. Trump to about $66,000. He said the gains of 8% are \u201cbetter than anything our predecessors have done, be they Democrat or Republican.\u201d\n\nThe president interjected, \u201cMaybe ever, Larry, right? Maybe ever. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been done.\u201d\n\nMr. Kudlow listed some of the strong economic news: a 3.5% unemployment rate in September, the lowest in 51 years; an annual inflation rate of 1.4%; a roughly 50% increase in the stock market since November 2016 (actually about 35% since Mr. Trump took office, according to a Macrotrends running chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average); and disposable income growth at an annual rate of about 3%.\n\nHe pointed to Moody\u2019s economist Mark Zandi\u2019s \u201cpocketbook model\u201d forecasting that, if the economic conditions remain stable, the president should win 289 to 351 electoral votes in November 2020. Mr. Trump needs 270 to win reelection.\n\nThe president cut in, \u201cSo they\u2019re predicting who is going to win the election, Larry?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are the kinds of numbers that suggest a very substantial victory,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said.\n\nBut then there\u2019s impeachment and the infamous phone call in which Mr. Trump did or did not pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden.\n\nMrs. Pelosi is making Democrats\u2019 case that Mr. Trump committed a \u201cshakedown\u201d and \u201ccover-up\u201d by pressuring Ukraine this summer. In a widely distributed \u201cfact sheet,\u201d she outlined the major developments to come out of a whistleblower report and the closed-door sessions that are at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIt selects a handful of quotes about the \u201cfavor\u201d that Mr. Trump referred to in the transcript released last month of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe fact sheet also highlights that Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are \u201centangled\u201d in the allegations. It accuses them of doing nothing to stop the administration from holding up military aid for Ukraine.\n\nWhile the Democrats outline core arguments in the impeachment inquiry, Republicans have started an all-out pressure campaign that frames the investigation as an unfair, secretive and biased process.\n\n\u201cOf course they want to impeach,\u201d Mr. Trump said with apparent exasperation. \u201cIt\u2019s so illegitimate. It cannot be the way our great Founders meant it to be. I have the strongest economy ever. \u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u2019 right? We\u2019re setting records. We\u2019ve had the highest stock market over 100 times. You know why it went through the roof? Because they got rid of [former President Barack] Obama, and they got rid of Clinton.\u201d\n\nFormer White House strategist Steve Bannon said the president can forget about Mr. Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the current Democratic front-runners. If the president survives impeachment, he said, then former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton likely will join the presidential race.\n\n\u201cBloomberg or Clinton could be very competitive,\u201d Mr. Bannon told the New York Post. \u201cShe is a very formidable candidate, and I think Bloomberg would be very formidable.\u201d\n\nA person close to the president speculated that Mr. Trump might choose resignation if his chances of surviving impeachment become dicier.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a fighter,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe only fights when he knows he\u2019s going to win.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump did fight to the end of the 2016 race, when virtually all pundits and pollsters predicted he would lose.\n\nThe president expressed frustration that he is forced to spend time and energy on impeachment when he is trying to keep on track his agenda of deregulation, fair trade and low taxes.\n\n\u201cI have to fight off these lowlifes at the same time I\u2019m negotiating these very important things,\u201d the president said. \u201cThe president of the United States should be allowed to run the country \u2014 not have to focus on this kind of crap. \u2026 I\u2019m making a big difference for the country.\u201d\n\nHe urged Mrs. Pelosi to take up the U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade agreement, a call echoed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who blasted Democrats\u2019 \u201c3-year-old impeachment parade\u201d for getting in the way of the trade deal and military funding.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the only thing that seems to really inspire House Democrats these days is their obsession with overturning the results of the 2016 election,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said Monday on the Senate floor.\n\nThe three House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry plan to interview more witnesses privately this week, including Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the quickening impeachment probe, Mr. Trump is pointing to recent results in a special election in North Carolina and the governor\u2019s race in Louisiana as evidence of momentum for the Republican Party. He also cites the massive attendance at his rallies, such as an event in Dallas last week that drew a capacity crowd of 20,000, with thousands more unable to enter.\n\nHe said the crowd\u2019s response to his speech in Dallas confirmed for him that he is still on the path that he promised voters in 2016, including a pledge to bring home U.S. troops from \u201cendless\u201d wars in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cMy largest cheer in Dallas [was] when I said we\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home \u2014 the place went crazy,\u201d the president said. \u201cI have to do what I got elected on.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Gabriella Mu\u00f1oz and Ryan Lovelace contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
