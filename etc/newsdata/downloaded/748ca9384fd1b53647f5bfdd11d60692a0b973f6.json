Asked about it on Thursday evening, Trump said he has already identified a replacement and would nominate one \"soon.\"\n\nOne of the original members of Trump\u2019s cabinet, Perry has been responsible for US energy policy \u2013 including safeguarding the nuclear arsenal \u2013 and the controversial rebranding of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) as \u201cmolecules of freedom\u201d in an attempt to make it more attractive to buyers in Europe than the far cheaper, more easily available Russian gas.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Molecules of freedom\u2019?! US Energy Department rebrands LNG as \u2018freedom gas\u2019\n\nHe has also been under increased scrutiny lately over his role as a liaison with the new government in Ukraine, as Democrats seek to impeach Trump over allegations he \u201cpressured\u201d Kiev into \u201cdigging up dirt\u201d on former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Wednesday, Perry said that Trump had asked him to reach out to Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, after Volodymyr Zelensky was elected in the April presidential runoff.\n\nPerry\u2019s call to Giuliani came after a May meeting at the White House where Trump told him, Sondland, Volker and Ron Johnson to work with Giuliani to resolve his concerns about Ukraine before he would agree to a Zelensky meeting.https://t.co/Fhms4MnLes \u2014 Rebecca Ballhaus (@rebeccaballhaus) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cAnd as I recall the conversation, [Giuliani] said, \u2018Look, the president is really concerned that there are people in Ukraine that tried to beat him during this presidential election\u2019,\u201d Perry told the WSJ. \u201c\u2018He thinks they\u2019re corrupt and\u2026 that there are still people over there engaged that are absolutely corrupt\u2019.\u201d\n\nPerry said that Giuliani had blamed Ukraine for the so-called Steele Dossier, a collection of claims about Trump compiled by a British spy funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016, used since to investigate the president for \u201cRussian collusion.\u201d\n\nThe former Texas governor (2000-2015) made two unsuccessful presidential bids, in 2012 and 2016. His appointment to lead Energy was particularly ironic given that he could not recall the department\u2019s existence during a 2011 Republican presidential debate, when he tried to name three Cabinet portfolios he would abolish if elected.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
