What they don\u2019t need now is tactical stupidity | Catherine Bennett", "language": "en", "text": "Considering its rapid expansion, formal commitment to causing chaos and decentralised approach to mobilising, Extinction Rebellion has been, certainly until last week\u2019s underground setback, a triumph of non-violent direct action.\n\nPolls have suggested impressive levels of support from non-protesters. As for the rebels, name-calling, including by the prime minister, dredging up a 90s term from his insult back-catalogue, only underlined their organisational flair. These same \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d have persuaded a previous parliament to declare a climate emergency, changed the national conversation and initiated policy change.\n\nBad publicity has been restricted, on the whole, to a misfiring fake-blood hose, and \u2013 although systemic rather than individual change is XR\u2019s purpose \u2013 the scant evidence that its A-list supporters are addressing their own carbon footprints.\n\nThat celebrated social disruptor, Stanley Johnson \u2013 who invited him? \u2013 was happy to confirm, for instance, shortly after exhibiting himself at an XR occupation, his commitment to frequent long-haul flying. It\u2019s OK, apparently, if the flier is going to make \u201csome speech about the environmental problems or write about the animals\u201d. If you would like to support Stanley in this vital work, it may not be too late to join him, and fellow Telegraph readers, on a 13-night \u201cTreasures of India\u201d holiday: \u201cStanley will be with you for the duration of this tour.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Benedict Cumberbatch \u2018evidently reconciled his anxiety about the climate emergency with his optimism for a new MG SUV\u2019. Photograph: @xr_richmond\n\nAnother sign that XR\u2019s influencer collection could be more discerning was the involvement of Benedict Cumberbatch, the actor having evidently reconciled his anxiety about the climate emergency with his optimism for a new MG SUV. Expected in both petrol and diesel versions, the Hector, according to Cumberbatch in his MG ad, \u201cmay well be a classic of the future\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s not all doom and gloom! Someone should tell Greta Thunberg.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s probably a credit to the movement\u2019s focus that such alleged inconsistency appears to have inflicted only minor reputational damage and may even have diverted media attention, quite usefully, from more substantial questions. Such as: why do so many XR occupations look like an audience in search of the National Theatre? And why would an XR campaigner think it persuasive to tweet: \u201cWe are engineers. We are lawyers. We are doctors. We are everyone\u201d? Maybe they run a prep school. As George Monbiot wrote last week, before going off to get himself arrested: \u201cExtinction Rebellion is too white, and too middle class.\u201d But perhaps that\u2019s in the nature of this form of direct action? If online activism as argued by Helen Margetts et al in Political Turbulence \u201cincreases the access of the poor to political action and reduces the relative advantage of the rich\u201d, then XR\u2019s focus on extended physical occupations appears to do the opposite.\n\nIt could be that its main ambition, to force change through disruption \u2013 as opposed to by petitions, by cost-free micro-interventions \u2013 is indeed at odds with social inclusiveness. Ayesha Hazarika said, on Radio 4\u2019s The News Quiz: \u201cIt is literally all white people. And it\u2019s all like white schoolkids because no Asian schoolkid would be allowed to miss school.\u201d The movement\u2019s commitment to multiple arrests will deter, or keep at the margins, individuals for whom arrest or being in trouble involves real fear or jeopardy.\n\nWhether it\u2019s exclusionary, unavoidable or even irrelevant, given what\u2019s at stake, this is not a great look. So at least while XR\u2019s critics are ridiculing luvvies they aren\u2019t dwelling on diversity \u2013 or the lack of it; the movement\u2019s apparent remoteness from people who might want to paint their faces white, dress up in red and parade along blocked roads making artistic gestures at police officers, but have to get to work instead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Social media has communicated its more edifying spectacles \u2013 the pink octopus, the cute boat, the dignified octogenarian arrestees \u2013 to the world.\u2019 Photograph: Isabel Infantes/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut that changed, of course, when a sub-group of rebels, ignoring the majority view that this was a bad idea, stopped a train at Canning Town in rush hour. While nobody could deny their bravery, since even a non-rucksack-remover in these rammed conditions would be widely regarded as asking for it, the resulting scene, showing the climate protesters looking, literally de haut en bas, upon the struggling commuters below, might as well have been directed by Adam Boulton, based on an original preconception by Piers Morgan. Although one man\u2019s shout, at an elevated rebel \u2013 \u201cI need to get to work! I have to feed my kids!\u201d \u2013 would probably have been cut, being too close to something Richard Littlejohn might make up.\n\nThe same social media that has, thanks to XR\u2019s volunteer amplifiers, communicated its more edifying spectacles \u2013 the pink octopus, the cute boat, the dignified octogenarian arrestees \u2013 to the world, then ensured maximum damage, from this ugly, privilege v workers narrative, in the shortest time. As they came in, reactions from different parts of XR\u2019s membership, largely disapproving or furious, though also defensive, occasionally patronising, were what you\u2019d expect from a decentralised movement that repudiates hierarchical organisation in favour of bottom-up \u201caffinity groups\u201d, disrupting on their own initiative. One spokesman, Rupert Read, said he was \u201creally sorry\u201d. Another, Howard Rees, said: \u201cWas it the right thing to do? I am not sure.\u201d One of the movement\u2019s co-founders, Clare Farrell, said it was justified: \u201cThe public, I don\u2019t think, realise quite how serious this situation is.\u201d\n\nIf not, you could argue, after multiple major protests, and any number of arrests, that this is a good moment for a strategic review. To build on its achievements and extract change, XR must find a way, as Occupy and other mobilisations have not, of sustaining participation, whether mass or niche. That seems less, not more, likely to happen if some of its affinity groups appear, and not only in Canning Town, to regard fellow citizens as incidental to their higher purpose. Having said that, I\u2019ve never had the chance to be educated when already late for work, by a retired vicar, stuck to a tube door.\n\n\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist", "description": "Climbing on tube trains to stop people going to work is not the best way to attract new recruits", "authors": ["Catherine Bennett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27ec8a7a606df88d7e53f293b9640f3f3a6f8a6b/166_171_1513_908/master/1513.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a6e47f60317800268535c9892363cb56", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
