USA TODAY\n\nHunter Biden repeatedly admitted he made a \"mistake\" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president but denied doing anything \"improper,\" in an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday.\n\nBiden, speaking with reporter Amy Robach at his Los Angeles home, described his dealings with the company, Burisma, as \"poor judgment\" on his part that \"gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\" former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBut he said he did not do anything \"improper\" in \"any way whatsoever.\"\n\n\"I joined a board. I served honorably. I focused on corporate governance,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously said they found no evidence of wrongdoing on the Bidens part. President Donald Trump's effort, led by his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine into investigating potential corruption tied to Burisma and the Bidens' role with the company has sparked an impeachment inquiry alleging the president was using the power of his office to go after a political rival.\n\nUkraine: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive as young democracy battles corruption and distrust\n\nAt a rally last week in Minneapolis last week, Trump tore into the former vice president and implied his son had gone into hiding.\n\n\"Whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he?\" Trump asked the crowd.\n\nHunter Biden said he was \"hiding in plain sight.\"\n\n\"I don't regret being on the board, what I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea,\" Hunter Biden told ABC News.\n\nUkraine: Ukraine to review investigation of company tied to Hunter Biden\n\nWhere\u2019s Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nWHERE\u2019S HUNTER? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\n\"You know what, I'm a human, did I make a mistake? Maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not,\" he said.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Biden said of the political hay that has been made of his role with Burisma. as well as his business dealings in China. \"They feel like they have the license to go out and say whatever they want. It feels to me like living in some kind of 'Alice in Wonderland.'\"\n\nBiden said he felt he was qualified to sit on Burisma's board, but acknowledged that he would \"probably not\" have been offered the seat were it not for the fact that his father was vice president.\n\nHunter Biden: Hunter Biden will resign from board of Chinese firm, says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Hunter Biden says he did nothing \"improper\u201d while serving on board of Ukrainian gas company, but may have showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in joining.\n\n\n\n\u201cWas it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in\u2014in\u2014in many ways?
