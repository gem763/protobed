This wasn\u2019t a loss due to a controversial ref call or dirty play from the opposition. This was defeat in the face of greatness.\n\n\u2018We knew it would rile them\u2019: Mako Vunipola on England\u2019s haka response Read more\n\nImmigration minister Iain Less-Galloway summed up the mood of the nation when he tweeted on Sunday: \u201c1) The better team won. Congrats to England. They were superior in every facet & deserved victory. 2) The All Blacks lost with dignity & grace even though it hurt like hell. 3) It\u2019s good for the game to see more teams capable of winning the World Cup. Go Wales!\u201d\n\nThe Herald on Sunday, the country\u2019s largest Sunday paper, turned its entire front page black, and in small print declared gently: \u201cThe All Blacks are out of the World Cup.

I\u2019m usually really nervous watching the All Blacks but I wasn\u2019t yesterday because I never really felt like we were in the game,\u201d said Nelson.\n\n'Immense': England fans celebrate defeat of All Blacks Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit gutted the All Blacks didn\u2019t play better as it could have been an epic contest but they didn\u2019t seem to turn up for the game \u2013 I thought England were pretty incredible.\u201d\n\nAmidst the gracious and moderate reactions of most , the opposition National MP Judith Collins took the opportunity to take a dig, tweeting that an All Blacks World Cup defeat \u201cNever happened when we were in Govt\u201d .\n\nJudith Collins (@JudithCollinsMP) Never happened when we were in Govt\n\nThe National party leader, Simon Bridges, was praised for summing up the mood of the nation with his simple, unadorned response to the loss: \u201cBugger\u201d.\n\nNot all New Zealanders took it so well. One note of discord was the vandalism of a vehicle in Auckland. Painted up in the colours of the Union Jack, the mini has its windows smashed in outside a Devonport pub.\n\nThe incident appeared to be isolated however, with New Zealand police reporting a \u201cfairly routine\u201d Saturday night around the country, in terms of violence and family-harm incidents. Busy, as weekends always are, \u201cbut not out of the ordinary in terms of incidents or demand\u201d.\n\nNewshub (@NewshubNZ) Devonport pub has Union Jack car smashed after England beat the All Blacks https://t.co/oSuruGWFOs pic.twitter.com/MtNpNDyb4X\n\nFollowing significant All Blacks losses, sports analysts and the national media usually dissect in earnest what went wrong, who is to blame, and who should take the fall for it. The All Blacks\u2019 dominance on the rugby world stage is part of New Zealand\u2019s appeal as a tourist destination \u2013 \u201cthe home of rugby\u201d \u2013 and losses can have financial consequences too.\n\nBut this time around, the blame-game was unusually muted.\n\nAt the New Zealand Herald, its sports desk compiled the top five reasons the All Blacks lost, and in top billing was the simple reason \u201c1. England simply too good\u201d, followed closely by \u201cScoreboard pressure\u201d and \u201cEddie Jones\u201d.\n\nAt New Zealand\u2019s largest news website, Stuff, Sir Ian McGeechan wrote that he\u2019d never seen the All Blacks so outplayed \u2013 putting the spotlight on England\u2019s talent, rather than the All Blacks deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThis was a technical and tactical masterclass in which England had a complete appreciation of what they were trying to achieve. Eddie Jones, take a bow,\u201d McGeechan wrote.\n\nRWC Mood-O-Meter, Stuff, New Zealand Photograph: Stuff website\n\nStuff\u2019s national RWC Mood-O Meter \u2013 which was clocked at \u201cno worries\u201d on Friday afternoon, had swung to \u201cgutted\u201d by Sunday morning.\n\nBut considering the passion many New Zealanders have for the game \u2013 often described as the national religion \u2013 it was a \u201cgutted\u201d mired in respect, resignation, and continued love for a game that can surprise and even delight a country so used to world domination.", "description": "World Cup loss to England disappointing but not devastating as Eddie Jones praised for tactical masterclass", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa60418c4b52355d85e35b75c9fdaae9f9a86a9d/0_197_2969_1781/master/2969.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7e624fec7ae8ddbdef1d574bfb09ca5", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
