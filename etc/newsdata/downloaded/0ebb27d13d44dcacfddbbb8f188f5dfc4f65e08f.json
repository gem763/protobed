It can immediately determine who is making a racist chant \u2014 or it can illustrate the trajectory of fireworks.\"\n\nGravina adds that the tool being considered requires two panels per stadium section, is not overly expensive and is made by an Italian company.\n\nHe said the only obstacle is Italy's privacy laws, \"because (the device) can also listen to private conversations inside the stadium.\"\n\nThe federation is coordinating with the Interior Ministry with the aim of testing the tools during Italy's European Championship qualifier against Armenia in Palermo, Sicily, next month.\n\nOffensive chants have been aimed this season at Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan), Franck Kessie (AC Milan), Dalbert Henrique (Fiorentina), Miralem Pjanic (Juventus) and Ronaldo Vieira (Sampdoria).\n\nLukaku, Kessie, Dalbert, and Vieira are all black. They were targeted with monkey chants. Pjanic, a Bosnia international who is white, was called a \"Gypsy.\"\n\nBut the Italian league and federation have not consistently handed out penalties to the clubs whose fans were responsible or the offending fans themselves.\n\n\"This device allows you to perfectly distinguish a single voice,\" Gravina said. \"We would like to use this tool so that people who want to ruin the dignity of Italian and international football know that they can easily be identified and therefore punished.\n\n\"Our protocol is very strict but at times we can't identify in detail those responsible,\" Gravina added. \"So we need to rely on technology.\"\n\nGravina first detailed the possible use of the devices in an interview with Italian daily La Repubblica on Monday and added further detail in a news conference.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AndrewDampf\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
