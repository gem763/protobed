This is life-and-death stuff. And climate change is related to the fires in California. California is burning while the deniers make a joke out of the standards that could protect us all.\u201d\n\nBrown addressed the committee a month after the Trump administration announced it would be revoking California\u2019s Clean Air Act waiver that allowed it to establish its own air pollution standards. The administration argues the waiver hindered the federal government from establishing unified air pollution standards, a key issue for the auto industry.\n\nThe administration is expected to announce soon that it's rolling back Obama-era standards for tailpipe emissions, something California is adamantly against.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers on the committee called the two-part emissions rule irresponsible.\n\n\u201cThese rollbacks for fuel efficiency requirements are quite simply brazen and irresponsible,\u201d subcommittee Chairman Harley Rouda Harley Edwin RoudaGOP protest overshadows impeachment hearing Overnight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room Republicans storm closed-door hearing to protest impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Calif) said.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is gambling with people\u2019s lives here.\u201d\n\nBrown in particular pointed fingers at a number of automakers, who on Monday sided with the Trump administration in a lawsuit California brought against the EPA.\n\n\u201cIn the lawsuit you have [General Motors] against us, but we have 22 states on our side,\u201d Brown said of the states that signed with California on the September suit challenging the Trump rule.\n\n\u201cOur standards that you don\u2019t like, Republicans, it covers 42 percent of America. We\u2019ve seen this move before\u201d\n\nRepublicans showed their distaste for the hearing early in the morning by attempting to prematurely end the proceedings.\n\nArguing the hearing was poorly scheduled to coincide with ongoing impeachment depositions, Republicans called for a quorum vote to end the proceedings when only a handful of Democratic members were in attendance. After delaying the vote by nearly 20 minutes, Democrats narrowly gathered enough votes to continue the hearing, 7 to 6.\n\nAfter the scuffle, Brown said climate change should take precedence over impeachment.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of important things going on. Impeachment is important, but the climate is even more important. The most important threat facing the world and America is what\u2019s happening to our climate, our weather, our wellbeing,\u201d he said.", "description": "Jerry Brown, the former Democratic governor of California, didn\u2019t mince words Tuesday when he criticized the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to roll back the state's tailpipe emission standards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/govjerrybrown_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
