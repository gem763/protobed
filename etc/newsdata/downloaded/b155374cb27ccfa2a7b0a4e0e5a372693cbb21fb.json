He\u2019s the type of player we were missing, he never stops running,\u201d said Tuchel.\n\nGueye provided the midfield with much-needed stamina since Blaise Matuidi left for Juventus in 2017, proving essential with defensive tackles and impressive bursts going forward.\n\nWith the \u2018MCN\u2019 trio out, Argentine striker Mauro Icardi, loaned from Inter Milan, harassed the Real Madrid defense and created space for Di Maria while keeper Keylor Navas, who joined from Real, is expected to give the defence some peace of mind.\n\n\u201cWe have a great team, with more personality now,\u201d said Tuchel.\n\nPSG, however, are well aware that Group stage wins will mean nothing when the knockout phase comes in the winter.\n\nIn 2017, they beat Bayern 3-0 in the Group phase and tamed Liverpool 2-1 also in the Group phase last year, but those victories were followed by early exits.\n\nThe way they beat Real on Wednesday, however, was far more convincing.\n\n\u201cWe need to always play like we did, with character and personality. With aggressiveness, too,\u201d said centre back Thiago Silva.\n\n\u201cMbappe, Cavani and Neymar are phenomenons, but we have a solid squad of 25 players. Two of them were injured and one was suspended but what the other showed was brilliant.\u201d", "description": "Paris St Germain's crushing of Real Madrid in their Champions League opener was not a warning to their European rivals - it was more a self-confidence booster on the French side's return to the biggest stage after another humiliation.", "authors": ["Julien Pretot", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431591801&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0YP-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
