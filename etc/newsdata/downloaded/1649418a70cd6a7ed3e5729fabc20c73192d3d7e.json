It marked a shift in tone from a day earlier when he asserted that he could \"obliterate\" Turkey's economy if the country did anything \"out of line.\" Trump did not specify what that would entail.\n\nThe White House announced late Sunday that Turkey will soon be launching a military operation in northern Syria and that U.S. troops will no longer be \u201cin the immediate area\u201d when it happens. The U.S. had more than 1,000 troops deployed in northern Syria, working closely with Kurdish-led forces that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nSen.
