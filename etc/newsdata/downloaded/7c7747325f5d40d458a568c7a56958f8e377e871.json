I mean, obviously I can beat him again,\u201d Clinton told \u201cPBS Newshour\u201d host Judy Woodruff, referencing her popular vote win in 2016.\n\nHer comment came after President Trump suggested she jump in the race to \u201csteal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly one condition,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThe Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u201cC\u201d Subpoena!\u201d\n\nClinton responded, not to tempt her. \u201cDo your job,\u201d she said.\n\nDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 8, 2019\n\nCommenting on the exchange during her interview with Woodruff, the former secretary of state said the tweet was \u201cjust so typical of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails. We all know that. He\u2019s either lying or delusional or both \u2026 so maybe there does need to be a rematch. Obviously I can beat him again,\u201d she said.\n\n\"But, seriously, I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t think anyone understands, what motivates him other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation,\" Clinton wondered. \u201cI said during the campaign, there was no other Donald Trump. What you saw was what you were going to get, and I think a lot of Americans understandably thought, oh, no, that can\u2019t possibly be the case. Once he\u2019s in office, he will certainly moderate his behavior. Well, we see, no, he hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton claimed she could beat Donald Trump \u201cagain\u201d in 2020,\n\n\n\n\u201cObviously, I could beat him again...\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat stage of denial is this? ?? pic.twitter.com/iwQMgS1GlZ \u2014 Baylor Cook (@j_baylorcook) October 9, 2019\n\nClinton has said several times that she has no plans to run in 2020, but that hasn't stopped the rumor mills, and her latest tweet didn't help put the possibility to rest.", "description": ".10/09/2019 8:42:57AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/152/91a64dbb-6549-4545-be71-b3201d31f72a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
