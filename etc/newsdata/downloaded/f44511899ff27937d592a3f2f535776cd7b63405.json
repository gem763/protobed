How do you evoke the feeling of having your own library in a small space with a small budget? We surveyed some experts for advice.\n\nThe books\n\nBefore she starts any decorating project, New York City designer Tara Seawright asks clients to cut their collections. To help them decide what stays and what goes, she suggests that they think about each volume\u2019s day-to-day use and why they\u2019re buying and acquiring books in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of books has really changed, and things get very edited,\u201d she said, especially in New York, where space is at a premium. \u201cBooks have become more like a resource library, and people tend to keep books that are more visually arresting.\u201d\n\nOther questions to consider: Do you turn to a physical dictionary to look up words, or are you using an app? Do you have a favorite cookbook, or are you finding recipes online? Do you like to re-read your favorite books? Are there books that are personally meaningful to you? Do they help you with hobbies, work or school? When you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll have a curated collection that reflects your passions and interests without cluttering your space, Seawright said.\n\n[They left their corporate jobs to write kids\u2019 books in a barn.

(Hanna Hollenbach)\n\nThe cases\n\nDon\u2019t feel pressure to stick to petite furniture just because you\u2019re furnishing a small space. \u201cPeople tend to get a few small bookshelves in a small space and keep them all a manageable height, like four feet tall, but if you get a taller bookshelf that goes as close as you can to the ceiling, it makes a space feel much bigger than a lot of little shelves everywhere,\u201d said Laurie Gillman, co-owner of East City Bookshop in the District who has a background in interior design.\n\nShe recommends picking a larger piece for your main book storage, and then supplementing with smaller options as needed. \u201cHaving something that\u2019s bigger somehow makes the space feel more put together and inviting,\u201d she said.\n\nHanna Hollenbach, a 20-year-old student who documents her book collection on Instagram (@hannasbookhaven), stores most of her books on two simple Ikea Billy bookcases flanking two large windows in the living room of her one-bedroom apartment. She also uses a rolling utility cart with three compartments that she bought at Michael\u2019s. \u201cI wanted something different and inexpensive that I could move to different spaces,\u201d she said.\n\nTo add interest, she frequently switches books into different configurations. She also decorates her shelves with \u201cbook breaks\u201d \u2014 signs, candles and figurines to infuse personality into the display.\n\nGillman uses several Ikea bookcases, including the Billy, in her store, along with some more statement-making pieces in bright colors or chrome that she thrifted, found on Craigslist or even picked up off the sidewalk.\n\nThe alternatives\n\nThe options are limitless when it comes to storing and decorating with books, even if you lack space. Think about nooks and crannies or those spots that might not normally be used, such as above a door frame or under the treads of a staircase. If you have high kitchen cabinets in your kitchen that aren\u2019t seeing a lot of use, Seawright suggested taking the doors off the highest row and displaying books there.\n\nSeawright suggests putting shelves directly on the wall. If you do so, she recommends picking shelves that match the color of the walls (\u201cI don\u2019t think a wall shelf that you put books on should stand out,\u201d she said) and have an outside edge to prevent books from sliding and falling. Be careful not to hang shelves in places that would impede opening doors or windows.\n\nOr, don\u2019t use storage at all. As long as they\u2019re not in the way, piles of books on the floor or under windowsills can look artful and interesting. \u201cStack them next to a day bed to make a visual statement,\u201d Seawright suggested.\n\nThe rest\n\nYou don\u2019t need a window seat or a wood-paneled study to create a cozy reading spot. According to both Seawright and Gillman, the essentials are a comfy seat, good lighting and a place to set down a drink. If you read in coffee shops or libraries, \u201cstart noticing when you stay for a long time in a place and try to duplicate that in your own home,\u201d Seawright said.\n\nA supportive seat is important, because you won\u2019t use the space if you can\u2019t be comfortable there for a while, Seawright said. She suggests pairing it with a cushioned ottoman. \u201cPick something comfortable where you can put your feet that\u2019s not a stool,\u201d she said. Pillows and throws are inexpensive ways to add more softness.\n\nA place to set a drink, your phone or a small stack of books is essential. Gillman uses several nested tables in the store so she can have extra space to display books when she has more inventory during busy seasons, but anyone could apply this idea to their own space.\n\nAdequate lighting is key for good reading, and the dark basement space in her store presented challenges for Gillman that she solved with layered lighting. In addition to removing some of the bulbs from many of the pre-installed fluorescent lighting fixtures, Gillman picked table lamps with shades to concentrate diffused light in the shop\u2019s larger seating area. She said light should be about eye level when you\u2019re sitting. Seawright suggests investing in a dimmer switch to control the mood and to choose bulbs that don\u2019t have a blue tint to create warmth and coziness.\n\nYou could also go basic. \u201cYou could create a cozy book nook with some floor cushions, a light and maybe some milk crates to hold the books,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be the most beautiful or most expensive.\u201d", "description": "We asked experts for advice on storage and creating a cozy reading nook.", "authors": ["Helen Carefoot", "Helen Carefoot Is A Writer", "Editorial Aide For The Washington Post'S Features Section.
