USA TODAY\n\nThe Houston Astros responded Monday night to a Sports Illustrated article alleging that assistant general manager Brandon Taubman had taunted a group of female reporters in the clubhouse after Game 6 of the American League Championship Series.\n\nWrote SI reporter Stephanie Apstein: \"Assistant general manager Brandon Taubman turned to a group of three female reporters, including one wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and yelled, half a dozen times, 'Thank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so (bleeping) glad we got Osuna!' \"\n\nIn 2018, Roberto Osuna, then with the Blue Jays, was suspended 75 games by Major League Baseball under the league's domestic violence policy, but the Astros traded for him in July of that year.\n\nThe Astros released a statement responding to the article:\n\n\"The story posted by Sports Illustrated is misleading and completely irresponsible. An Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing. Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time. His comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else \u2013 they were also not directed toward any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated's attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\"\n\nOsuna gave up a game-tying home run in the top of the ninth on Saturday, but the Astros won the game on a walk-off homer in the bottom of the inning to clinch a spot in the World Series.", "description": "Roberto Osuna, then with the Blue Jays, was suspended 75 games by Major League Baseball in 2018 under the league's domestic violence policy.", "authors": ["Usa Today Sports", "Published P.M.
