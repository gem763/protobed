Plus, in opinion, George Monbiot on the global climate strike\n\nDavid Cameron announced his intention to resign as prime minister the morning after Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum he had decided to hold and then lost. It came after years of austerity, his government\u2019s response to the global financial crisis, in which huge cuts to local services had hit communities hard.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, tells Anushka Asthana that as political editor at the time, he watched Cameron\u2019s rise to the leadership and then into Downing Street. But his premiership was to be defined by those two big crises: the 2008 economic crash and Brexit. As Cameron publishes his memoirs, the consequences of the decisions he made as prime minister are still playing out in real time.\n\nAlso, as workers around the world down tools for a global climate strike, the Guardian\u2019s George Monbiot argues that you should join them. He and Greta Thunberg have made a short film on the climate crisis, by Gripping Films, that you can watch here.", "description": "As the former PM publishes his memoirs, Patrick Wintour tells Anushka Asthana that Cameron\u2019s pursuit of austerity and decision to call an EU referendum sowed the seeds of his demise.
