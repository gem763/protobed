I then asked to try it too. I spun round and rolled it right over Jennifer's foot!\n\nThe producers look of panic was if to say, \"Is it too late to fire him? Has his character been established yet?\" I felt awful. Such an inauspicious start.\"\n\nAnd Paul's awkward times with lead actress Jennifer did not stop there.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAfter being hired to play Phoebe Buffet's new boyfriend Mike, Paul had only been booked to appear in a few episodes but ended up sticking around when producers changed their script.\n\nPaul told chat show host Norton that he couldn't believe it when he was asked to appear in the iconic last episode of the series.\n\n\"The show was a phenomenon and I was in the very last episode, which made no sense to me whatsoever.\n\n\"I was on the sound stage and Jennifer Aniston was crying and I thought, \"I'm not supposed to be here\", so to break the ice I went over and said, \"Well, we did it, what a ride.\"\n\n\"The joke inevitably fell flat!\" he recalled.\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\n(Image: NBC via Getty Images)\n\nBut despite a few dicey moments, Paul said it was 'incredible' to be a part of the show which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year.\n\nClearly there was no grudge on Jennifer's part as she went on to play Paul's wife in the 2012 Wanderlust.\n\nRudd appears on The Graham Norton Show alongside Robert De Niro, Bruce Springsteen, Sienna Miller and James Blunt.\n\nThe Graham Norton Show is on BBC One at 10.35pm on Friday October 11.", "description": "The actor was hired to play temporary character Mike Hannigan - but ended up staying till the very end despite his nightmare first day", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Pa", "Rex Features", "Nbc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560229.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Graham-Norton-Show-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
