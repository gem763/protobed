Since then, Trebek, who has been at the center of the game show since 1984, has been undergoing treatments to \"beat the low survival rate statistics,\" he said. While he's been open about his battle, and his determination to fight the disease, he shared with CTV News on October 4 that he may have to leave Jeopardy due to health complications.\n\nTrebek, 79, explained that he's developed mouth sores from his chemotherapy that make it difficult for him to articulate.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are observant members of the television audience that notice also, but they\u2019re forgiving,\u201d Trebek said. \u201cBut there will come a point when they will no longer be able to say, \u2018It\u2019s okay.'\"\n\n\"I will keep doing it as long as my skills do not diminish, and they have started to diminish,\" Trebek, whose contract runs until 2020, said.\n\nThough he announced that he went into near remission in May, this September he had to undergo another round of treatment after his \"numbers went sky high.\" He told Good Morning America, \"I was doing so well. And my numbers went down to the equivalent of a normal human being who does not have pancreatic cancer. So we were all very optimistic.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Santiago Felipe - Getty Images More\n\n\u201cCancer is mysterious in more ways than one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen it happened early on I was down on myself,\u201d Trebek added. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how fallible each of us is in his or her own way\u2026 I talk to the audience sometimes and I get teary-eyed for no reason. I don\u2019t even bother to explain it anymore, I just experience it. I know it's a part of who I am and I just keep going.\u201d\n\nDespite the outpouring of support from fans, Trebek told CTV News, \"A lot of people are coming to me and looking for help, reassurance, and that's tough. I don't know if I'm strong enough or intelligent enough to help alleviate some of that despair, so it's tough on me.\"\n\nYet, Trebek has tried to remain positive. \"The thought of the pancreatic cancer does not frighten me. I'm 79 years old. So, hey, I've lived a good life, a full life, and I'm nearing the end of that life. I know that.\" But even so, he does want to continue to work for as long as he's able. In September he shared, \"As long as I can walk out and greet the audience and the contestants and run the game I'm happy.\"\n\nLike what you just read? You\u2019ll love our magazine!
