The shutdown will go ahead whether the U.K. departs with a deal, crashes out without one or secures another delay.\n\nAfter a weekend of political chaos that left Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement in tatters, the answer to that question remains as elusive as it was more than three years ago when the country voted to leave. U.K. Plc is nowhere nearer the clarity it craves.\n\n\u201cWe need tariff free, frictionless and seamless conditions to do business,\u201d Ralf Speth, chief executive officer of Jaguar Land Rover, said in an interview on Sunday.\n\nWhile most business leaders want to avoid a no-deal departure, continued uncertainty is not much better. With the cliff edge looming, and the prospect of another one in three months if the EU grants Parliament\u2019s request for a further delay, collateral damage is mounting.\n\n\u201cThere will be a hangover into next year, regardless of what happens next,\u201d said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. \u201cThe political inaction has had serious economic consequences.\u201d\n\nAfter Johnson secured an 11th-hour agreement with Brussels last week, industry groups including the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Retail Consortium had allowed themselves a glimmer of hope, urging politicians to move swiftly to end the state of limbo.\n\nThe weekend brought a reality check. In a rare Saturday sitting of the House of Commons, lawmakers denied Johnson the chance of putting his deal to the test by voting in favor of an amendment that basically required him to ask the EU for a delay.\n\nBonmarche, a womenswear retailer that has been struggling for years, late Friday went into administration, a British insolvency procedure, saying uncertainty over the departure from the EU delivered a knockout blow.\n\n\u201cThe delay in Brexit has created negativities, both in the global markets towards Britain and damaged consumer sentiment,\u201d CEO Helen Connolly said. \u201cWithout such a delay, it is feasible to believe that our issues would have been more manageable.\u201d\n\nOverall, the U.K. has weathered Brexit better than some had feared. The housing market has cooled but not collapsed. While the economy unexpectedly shrank in August, it\u2019s on track to avoid a recession in the third quarter.\n\nThe cost for companies has been steep, though. Carmakers are particularly exposed to the vicissitudes of Brexit because of their just-in-time supply chains. They\u2019ve spent more than 500 million pounds ($650 million) to prepare, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Toyota Motor Corp. and BMW AG have also announced plans to halt production, while Nissan Motor Co. has warned that tariffs on auto exports to the EU are likely to render its U.K. operations unsustainable.\n\nDrugmakers have had to build up supplies to ensure the U.K. doesn\u2019t fall short of essential medicines, while adding plant capacity elsewhere in the EU to meet post-Brexit regulatory requirements. AstraZeneca Plc has estimated that it\u2019s spending about 40 million pounds to 50 million pounds to make sure it can sell products overseas, while GlaxoSmithKline Plc sees its Brexit costs at almost double that amount.\n\nIn London\u2019s financial district, equity issuance has dried up and about 1,000 investment banking jobs have been moved to other European hubs. Banks have also earmarked up to 1 trillion pounds in assets to move to the EU, according to consultancy EY, but many have been slow to make the shift.\n\n\u201cThis rolling period of uncertainty does make it harder to plan around,\u201d said James Wood-Collins, CEO at specialist currency manager Record Plc.\n\nFarmers have been struggling to attract labor amid questions over EU nationals\u2019 post-Brexit rights in the U.K. About 16% of agricultural jobs went unfilled in September, forcing farms to seek labor from more non-EU nations, raising employment costs.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- In September, Jaguar Land Rover unveiled a new development facility near Coventry in central England, equipped with technologies like 3-D printing and dedicated to a futuristic vision dubbed \u201cDestination Zero\u201d: No emissions, accidents or congestion.Early next month, Britain\u2019s biggest auto", "authors": ["Eric Pfanner", "Siddharth Philip"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/12hQ47aH6fNZszkEHCTezQ--~B/aD04OTg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/46b172c470e5036098880b6b20f4df74", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
