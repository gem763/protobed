That\u2019s not an interest-rate policy development, but an investing fee trend.\n\nCharles Schwab Corp SCHW, -9.98% on Tuesday said it would no longer charge a commission on trades of U.S. and Canada-listed stocks, exchange-traded funds, and options, starting October 7.\n\nThat\u2019s just the latest volley in the incredible shrinking broker fee war. Behemoth asset managers like Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab have spent the past few years leapfrogging each other to offer lower and lower commissions.\n\nThat\u2019s thanks in part to the rise in popularity of ETFs, funds that in most cases passively follow a pre-determined index, and charge much lower fees to do so, while also performing better than pricey active managers.\n\nRelated: More evidence that passive fund management beats active\n\nHow miserly have investors become?\n\nThe largest and most-liquid ETF of all is also the world\u2019s first: the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust.
