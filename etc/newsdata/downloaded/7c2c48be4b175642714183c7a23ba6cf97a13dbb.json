I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country. You got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies and in the media. Maybe, just maybe, what we should be doing is creating an economy that works for all of us, not 1 percent,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s my understanding of democratic socialism.\u201d\n\nObama administration Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro was more blunt in his take.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call Maduro a dictator. Because he is a dictator,\u201d Castro said from the debate state.\n\nVenezuela has been in the throes of a political and humanitarian crisis which has resulted in clashes between opposition forces and Maduro\u2019s regime. Earlier this year, clashes broke out in the streets of the capital, Caracas, and armored military trucks of troops loyal to Maduro have been caught on video in May plowing into crowds of opposition protesters.\n\nThe U.S. has levied heavy sanctions on Venezuela in an effort to cripple Maduro\u2019s regime. The Trump administration has also pledged nearly $56 million in additional aid to partners in the region working to aid the Venezuelan people, many of whom are starving.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said during Thursday night's primary debate that his brand of democratic socialism has nothing to do with Venezuela's socialism, calling Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro a \"vicious tyrant.\"\"Anybody that does what Maduro does is", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lBhdwQjJ_mj5omiqXHTavA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/899fa8c99e97c48cd575f384d35bcc60"}
