Under the agreement, the Taliban renounce al Qaeda, which carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, and provides assurances that they won\u2019t allow it or any other Islamist militant groups to operate in Afghanistan\n\n\u201cI assure our believing Mujahid nation that we are on the verge of ending occupation & peaceful resolution for Afghanistan,\u201d tweeted the spokesman, Suhail Shaheen.\n\nSardar Razmal, a local reporter, said Sunday that the city was calm and residents had returned to the streets. \u201cShops are open and people are back to work,\u201d he said by telephone.\n\nMr. Khalilzad\u2019s expected visit to Kabul takes place a day after the Taliban raided Kunduz, an assault that recalled the three-day seizure of the northern city in 2015 that shook the country and signaled that the insurgency had spread far beyond its southern and eastern strongholds.\n\nMourners on Sunday displayed a portrait of Kunduz police spokesman Sayed Sarwar Hussaini, who was killed by a suicide bomber while he was speaking to reporters.

Scott Miller, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, traveled to Kunduz, 200 miles north of Kabul, to help local forces in the city\u2019s defense. The attack left 20 members of the security forces and five civilians dead, the Interior Ministry said Sunday, adding that 56 Taliban fighters were killed.\n\nIn their comments on Twitter early Sunday, neither Mr. Khalilzad nor Mr. Shaheen spelled out what tasks remained before U.S. and Taliban representatives formally sign a deal in a ceremony expected to take place in Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. The watershed moment will, if achieved, usher in separate talks, probably in Norway, between the Taliban and an Afghan delegation, including representatives of the government, about a cease-fire and how the country will be ruled.\n\nWhile Mr. Shaheen said members of the negotiating teams were to meet Sunday afternoon to \u201ciron out some technical details,\u201d it couldn\u2019t be determined, for instance, whether senior administration officials in Washington and the Taliban\u2019s Pakistan-based leadership council, the Quetta shura, still needed to sign off on the text of the deal, which is in Afghanistan\u2019s official languages, Pashto and Dari, as well as English.\n\nWith a U.S.-Taliban accord nearly wrapped up, Mr. Khalizad\u2019s meeting with the Afghan president could be strained, observers said.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s longstanding refusal to hold direct peace talks with any government in Kabul has sidelined Mr. Ghani from the Doha discussions. Critics also say that Mr. Ghani, fearing he may be pushed aside in the new power-sharing government to be negotiated in Norway, has deliberately slow-walked the peace process to protect his bid for another five-year term in presidential elections scheduled for later this month.\n\nMr. Ghani and other Afghan government officials have publicly welcomed Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s progress in Doha. Privately, however, they have fumed over being sidelined from the talks, disparaged the Afghan-born Mr. Khalilzad and according to one high-placed security official, sought to drive a wedge between him and other U.S. officials and members of U.S. Congress.\n\nYet with the Doha talks on the cusp of a signal achievement, Mr. Ghani and his government will now be forced to deal with Mr. Khalilzad as attention shifts to Afghan-to-Afghan talks on a cease-fire and future power-sharing arrangements, said an Afghan familiar with the government\u2019s deliberations on the peace process.\n\n\u201cGhani and inner circle now have more reasons to think Khalilzad is central to the peace process and will remain so,\u201d the person said. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep wishing someone in the Pentagon, in the White House or somewhere else in Washington will buy their perspective.\u201d\n\nWhether Mr. Ghani grasps the urgency for progress toward ending the war that Mr. Khalilzad, the Trump administration and most of the Afghan public voice is uncertain. He has told aides that he will need far longer than the nine months U.S. has taken to get a withdrawal agreement to achieve a deal on a cease-fire and future political arrangements in the country.\n\n\u201cMore important, though, than time, Ghani will continue to seek control of the intra-Afghan talks from Khalilzad,\u201d the person said. \u201cInside, he and members of his inner circle will be seething that a process they wished had blown up or gotten disrupted in their favor has been meticulously steered by the man sitting opposite them.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ehsanullah Amiri contributed to this article,\n\nWrite to Craig Nelson at craig.nelson@wsj.com", "description": "With a landmark deal with the Taliban nearly completed, the U.S. diplomat overseeing peace talks with the insurgents arrived in Kabul to brief top Afghan officials and discuss next steps on a comprehensive settlement of the nearly 18-year Afghan war.", "authors": ["Craig Nelson", "Craig.Nelson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103199/social"}
