Zeldin: House Dems Using \u2018Creativity\u2019 in Questioning to Connect Dots That Don\u2019t Exist", "language": "en", "text": "Tuesday, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d that after sitting in on all impeachment inquiry depositions that have taken place, the House Democrats have \u201cnothing\u201d to \u201cpossibly impeach the president of the United States for.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what the Democrats do have to continue the impeachment investigation, Zeldin replied that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) and his fellow Democrats have been using \u201ccreativity\u201d in their questioning to connect dots that do not exist.\n\n\u201cThey have creativity in developing a narrative, a story to try to connect all sorts of different dots that aren\u2019t actually connected,\u201d Zeldin stated.\n\n\u201cI see it with the way Chairman Schiff asks his questions inside these depositions,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe will make multiple leaps and assumptions, finish it with a simple question. If you give a simple answer, you might think you\u2019re answering a question, but you bought into the premise of this question that has all these different assumptions. It is very leading the way he asks his question.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Tuesday, Rep.
