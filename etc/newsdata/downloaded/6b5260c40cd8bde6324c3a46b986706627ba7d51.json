(Image: Mondo, Bottleneck)\n\nIt\u2019s rare that you can buy not one, not two, but three absolutely incredible, limited edition posters at the same time \u2014 but today is one of those days.\n\nFrom now until Thursday, you can buy a Star Wars: The Last Jedi poster by Rory Kurtz, a Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse poster by Martin Ansin, and a Jaws poster by Anthony Petrie as timed edition screenprints. That means the companies releasing them will make as many as they sell, but when the sale ends, the posters won\u2019t be printed again.\n\nFirst up, we\u2019ll start with The Last Jedi. The poster is called \u201cTrue Enemy\u201d and it\u2019s by artist Rory Kurtz. It\u2019s a 60 x 91cm screenprint that costs $146 (because it takes 18 layers to make each poster) and it\u2019s on sale at this link. (A variant without titles was sold at MondoCon in Austin, but that was a run of only 225).\n\n\u201cTrue Enemy\u201d (Regular Edition) by Rory Kurtz. (Image: Mondo)\n\n\u201cI feel like there\u2019s so much more to The Last Jedi that runs beneath the surface,\u201d Kurtz told Gizmodo via email. \u201cIt\u2019s unpredictable and moody with ambitions beyond running the same story points over and over. While there\u2019s a lot of controversy over the directions it takes, visually it jumps off the screen. And I loved the risks it took. The moment Rey and Kylo fought back to back, I was sold on it. Their arc together is the lifeblood of this new series.\u201d\n\nNext up is Jaws. The poster in question is called \u201cChum Chart\u201d and it\u2019s by artist Anthony Petrie. Now, if you think you\u2019re having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, you aren\u2019t.\n\nThis is an update of a poster that was released in 2015. However, that poster was very limited, has long since sold out, and has since become highly collectible. And yet Petrie kept getting emails asking for a re-release. He couldn\u2019t just do that, of course. So instead, he and the team at the Bottleneck Gallery got it officially licensed by Amblin and Universal, which meant the official title and credits could be put on. It\u2019s also a slightly different colour.\n\n\u201cChum Chart\u201d is a 90 x 61cm screenprint that costs $73 and will be on sale at this link. Here\u2019s the poster.\n\n\u201cChum Chart\u201d (Timed Variant) by Anthony Petrie (Image: Bottleneck/Vice)\n\nFinally, here\u2019s a gorgeous take on our favourite movie of 2018, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Artist Martin Ansin absolutely knocked it out of the park with this vibrant, energetic interpretation of the film, filled with winks, nods and Easter eggs. It\u2019s a 60 x 91cm screenprint that costs $87 It\u2019ll be on sale at this link.\n\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (Regular Edition) by Martin Ansin (Image: Mondo)\n\nIf any of these posters were set to a specific number, they would have sold out in seconds. But now, if you want, you can get them all. How awesome is that?\n\nAgain: The Last Jedi at this link, Jaws at this link, and Spider-Verse at this link.", "description": "It\u2019s rare that you can buy not one, not two, but three absolutely incredible, limited edition posters at the same time \u2014 but today is one of those days....", "authors": ["Germain Lussier", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/je3mohfnbtgcbgqrxvnl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
