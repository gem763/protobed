If approved by a vote in parliament on Tuesday, they would then take control of business in parliament from 1400 GMT on Wednesday.\n\nThey would use this time on Wednesday try to pass a law, against the government\u2019s wishes.\n\nThis is what the legislation would do:\n\n- It requires that by Oct. 19, the government must meet one of the following two conditions:\n\n1) Reach a deal with the EU, which is the approved by parliament\n\n2) Get parliament\u2019s approval to leave without a deal\n\n- If neither of these has happened, the government must write to the European Union seeking an extension until Jan 31, 2020.\n\n- If the EU agrees to an extension to Jan 31, Johnson must immediately accept the extension.\n\n- If the European Council proposes an extension to a different date then the Johnson must accept that extension within two days, unless parliament rejects it.\n\n- If either of these conditions are met after the letter is sent, then the government can withdraw or amend the letter.", "description": "British lawmakers opposed to a no-deal Brexit will seek to take control of parliamentary time on Wednesday to pass legislation which would force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek a three-month delay to Brexit.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
