The Business Times\n\nWant to Netflix and chill but subscription prices are hurting your wallet?\n\nFret no more as Netflix is releasing a mobile-only plan for Malaysia \u2013 which comes after last year\u2019s testing \u2013 and it will cost you a mere RM17 (US$4) a month.\n\nAnnounced on Wednesday (Oct 23), the subscription will allow users to watch all of Netflix\u2019s content \u2013 local and international \u2013 in standard definition (SD) on one smartphone or tablet at a time.
