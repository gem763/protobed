(AP) \u2014 At least 25 people were confirmed dead and nine others still missing after a tragic boat fire early Monday near an island off the Southern California coast.\n\nThe dive-boat Conception, far out to sea in the middle of the night, became fully engulfed in flames as 30 passengers on a recreational scuba diving trip slept below deck.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for a worse situation,\u201d Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said at a Monday news conference.\n\nCoast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Kroll says at least 25 people on a recreational scuba-diving trip died and the search will continue through the night for the nine others still missing. He says five others have been found but not recovered due to unsafe conditions under the boat, which sank in about 60 feet (18 meters) of water. Kroll that says these numbers are based on initial reports and authorities are awaiting final counts from the autopsies.\n\nFive crew members sleeping on the top deck jumped off and took a dinghy to safety. Two had minor injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities opened a family assistance center where counseling was being provided to relatives of those onboard. None of their names were immediately released.\n\nThe missing and dead were among 39 passengers and crew who had departed Santa Barbara\u2019s Channel Islands Harbor on Saturday aboard the boat Conception for a Labor Day weekend scuba-diving trip.\n\nThe fire broke out about 3 a.m. as the Conception was anchored off Santa Cruz Island, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles. The crew appeared to quickly call for help.\n\n\u201cThe call was garbled, it was not that clear, but we were able to get some information out of it to send vessels,\u201d said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.\n\nCapt. Paul Amaral of the vessel assistance company TowBoatUS also launched a fast boat from Ventura Harbor, but it was some 30 miles (48 kilometers) away. By the time it got there around 5 a.m. a Coast Guard helicopter and a fireboat were on scene.\n\nAmaral said he first searched the water and shoreline, then turned back to the Conception, which was adrift and going aground. He attached a line and pulled it into deeper water where the fireboats could reach.\n\n\u201cWe launched that boat knowing that the vessel was on fire, lots of people aboard,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nThe five crew members, meanwhile, had taken their dingy to a private fishing boat, The Grape Escape, that was anchored near the north shore of Santa Cruz Island.\n\nThat boat\u2019s owners, Bob and Shirley Hansen, told The New York Times they were asleep when they heard pounding on the side of their 60-foot (18-meter) vessel about 3:30 a.m. and discovered the frightened crew members.\n\n\u201cWhen we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cI could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat. There were these explosions every few beats. You can\u2019t prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.\u201d\n\nHansen said two of the crew members went back toward the Conception looking for survivors but found no one.\n\nFour bodies had injuries consistent with drowning, Kroll said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear when the other bodies that have been found might be retrieved or when divers could search the boat for others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s upside down in relatively shallow water with receding tides that are moving it around,\u201d Brown said. Investigators have not yet determined a cause for the fire.\n\nThe 75-foot (23-meter) Conception was on a three-day excursion to the chain of rugged, wind-swept isles that form Channel Islands National Park in the Pacific Ocean west of Los Angeles. The fire broke out as the boat sat anchored in Platt\u2019s Harbor off Santa Cruz Island.\n\nThe Conception, based in Santa Barbara Harbor on the mainland, was owned by Santa Barbara-based Truth Aquatics, founded in 1974. A memorial outside Truth Aquatics in the Santa Barbara Harbor grew Monday night as mourners came to pay their respects.\n\nDave Reid, who runs an underwater camera manufacturing business with his wife, Terry Schuller, and has traveled on the Conception and two other boats in Truth Aquatics\u2019 fleet, said he considered all three among the best and safest.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the boats they are always immaculate,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hesitate at all to go on one again. Of all the boat companies, that would be one of the ones I wouldn\u2019t think this would happen to.\u201d\n\nHis wife said Truth Aquatics crews have always been meticulous in going over safety instructions at the beginning of every trip she\u2019s been on.\n\n\u201cThey tell you where the life jackets are, how to put them on \u2026 the exits, where the fire extinguishers are, on every single trip,\u201d said Schuller. \u201cThey are the best, the absolute best.\u201d\n\nBoth said the sleeping area is comfortable but tight, however, with bunk beds stacked next to one another on the lowest deck. Coming up to the top deck to get off requires navigating a narrow stairway with only one exit.\n\nIf the fire was fast-moving, Reid said, it\u2019s very likely divers couldn\u2019t escape and the crew couldn\u2019t get to them.\n\nCoast Guard records show all safety violations from the last five years were quickly addressed by the boat\u2019s owners. Some safety violations were related to fire safety. A 2016 inspection resulted in owners replacing the heat detector in the galley and one in 2014 cited a leaky fire hose.\n\nThe Conception was chartered by Worldwide Diving Adventures, which says on its website that it has been taking divers on such expeditions since the 1970s.\n\nAndy Taylor, owner of Blue Water Hunter Dive Shop in Santa Barbara, said he discussed dive conditions with several people Friday as they were buying some last-minute things before boarding the Conception. Taylor said he often sends divers to Truth Aquatics for trips and he has friends who have crewed on the Conception.\n\nHe said he was on the phone all day Monday as friends checked to make sure he wasn\u2019t on the boat.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s a big question of who was on there and who wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m scared to see the list of names, honestly.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers John Antczak, John Rogers, Frank Baker and Justin Pritchard in Los Angeles, Stephanie Mullen in San Francisco, Michael R.
