Far from it. Despite spending almost a decade interviewing the world\u2019s top investors about their strategies and mindset as a financial journalist, I struggled to even bring myself to open an ISA. I clearly remember how experts never thought the FTSE 100 would break the 7,000 mark, but I can\u2019t recall which hole in the ground my savings fell into. I even spent 18 months working in New York and wracked up hundreds of pounds in bank charges because I didn\u2019t get one of those\u2026 foreign currency card thingys.\n\nAnd if I\u2019ve been a bit, shall we say, lax, with my cash, then I imagine many others are in the same boat? After all, most of us didn\u2019t get financial education at school, and I think a lesson on pensions or how to send an invoice would have been more useful than weekly experiments in Home Economics about how much baking soda can ruin a brownie.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Getty Images for Stuart Weitzman\n\nIn my defence, it\u2019s tempting to be apathetic in a world where most of the \u201cbenefits\u201d of products like pensions and ISAs benefit the truly rich. Getting on the property ladder is almost impossible \u2013 most of us need our parents to help out. The cycle of poverty is real, and money only makes more money if you have it in the first place.\n\nMy third excuse is that money, for some unfathomable reason, is put in the same category as rocket science \u2013 technical, detailed, irrelevant \u2013 or it\u2019s seen as an imminent disaster, with American pundits screaming on cable news about the latest hot stock or announcement by the central bank. We put money experts on a pedestal and worship them \u2013 and that didn\u2019t turn out so well for former fund manager star Neil Woodford. But money is not an exclusive club. For example, we don\u2019t need to be up to speed on the ramifications of every by-election to take an interest in politics. We also don\u2019t need to know the direction of equity markets (they normally go up over the long term anyway) or know the interest rate of a government bond to sort out our finances.\n\nSo, the million-dollar question: how can I get better with my money? One is learning, and talking to other people about their finances. Taking small steps at a time. Deciding what I really want and focusing on my goals, rather than saving for a future I don\u2019t know is going to happen. (Despite women\u2019s mags advising me to the contrary, I refuse to give up my takeaway coffee most days \u2013 I get a discount with my KeepCup.) I\u2019ve taken some simple steps over the last year instead: consolidate my pensions into one pot; invest in premium bonds; open a stocks and shares ISA; put aside 30 per cent of my income to pay tax and student loan, and cut down on what I spend i.e. subscriptions and fast fashion.\n\nThere is a higher purpose here, I like to think. In the UK, there is a very significant gender pay gap (8.6 per cent for full-time workers), a gender pension gap (almost 40 per cent in 2017/18) and a gender investment gap, (YouGov research shows that 52 per cent of women have never put their money into an investment product, compared to 37 per cent of men). And while what we really need is to change the overarching structures that affect those gaps i.e. corporate transparency and legislation \u2013 in the meantime we can at least gain confidence in our own money matters.\n\nAnd we should gain confidence, because research shows that women make good, if not better, investors compared to men. Women are more risk averse, and less emotional. As someone who has interviewed the man who brought down Barings Bank in the 1990s through excessive risk taking, I believe this to be true.\n\nIn other words, I want to shake that magic money tree. That\u2019s why I decided to launch a podcast about how money affects our lives \u2013 our work, health, relationships, and everything else. Dealing with money is unavoidable, yet we often feel like talking about it is dirty, distasteful, or out of our remit. It\u2019s time that changed, for our own sake.\n\nRachael Revesz is a journalist and host of An Honest Account, a podcast about how money affects our lives", "description": "I have a simple, rallying cry: women need to do more with their money.", "authors": ["Rachael Revesz"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/10/woman-money.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
