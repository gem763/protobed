If he were to die, Washington state would collect a windfall. (JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMany people would assume that billionaires could live wherever they want to, but a new study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research finds that the extremely rich are, in fact, extremely sensitive to local tax changes.\n\nBefore 2001, there was a federal tax credit that fully offset state-specific estate taxes. But after the tax cuts passed by President George W. Bush, the credit was phased out and how much a person\u2019s estate is taxed upon death became highly dependent on where their primary residence was.\n\nResearchers Enrico Moretti of UC Berkeley and Daniel J. Wilson of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that the \u201cthe number of Forbes 400 individuals in estate tax states fell by 35%\u201d after 2001.\n\n\"On average, estate tax states lose 2.35 Forbes 400 individuals relative to non-estate tax states,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe idea of having to pay the estate tax upon death especially hits older billionaires, the research noted, which exhibit even higher sensitivity to tax policy (presumably because they\u2019re more aware of the potential hit to their estate as their mortality comes into view).\n\nBut despite the impact, the research found that the revenue benefit of an estate tax exceeds the cost for the \u201cvast majority of states.\u201d In other words, taxing the billionaires is usually worth it.\n\n\u201cGiven the rise of wealth owned by those at the top of the distribution, taxes on large estates have a growing potential to significantly impact budgets of entire states,\u201d the paper said.\n\nStates that impose estate taxes \u2014 like New York and Massachusetts \u2014 collect a significant amount of revenue when their ultra-wealthy residents die. For example, when Walmart co-founder Bud Walton died in 1995, Arkansas\u2019s estate tax revenue increased 425% to $183.2 million, solely because of the estate tax on Walton\u2019s $1 billion fortune, according to the study.\n\nIn this Saturday, June 29, 2019, file photograph, Charles Koch, chief executive officer of Koch Industries, right, is shown with his son, Chase Koch, at The Broadmoor Resort in Colorado Springs, Colo.

The billionaire businessman had an estimated net worth of $50.5 billion and lived in New York, which has an estate tax. The researchers factored in tax sheltering and donations and estimated that New York should expect to receive \"around $4.17 billion.\u201d (In New York State, the first $5.74 million isn't taxed, but estates over that amount is, starting at 3.06% and going up to 16% after the next $10.1 million.)\n\nThe effect gets more pronounced with the wealth. The paper notes that if Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos died today, Washington state would get around $11.97 billion from his estate, which would raise \u201cWashington state\u2019s total tax revenues from all sources by about 52.1% in a single year.\u201d\n\nThe paper points out that most billionaires are not at the level of Koch, Bezos, or Bill Gates, and that the median billionaire on the Forbes 400 list has \u201conly\u201d $3.7 billion. (Previous studies by economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez found that IRS data is consistent with Forbes\u2019 data.) But even less-wealthy billionaires increase a state\u2019s revenue through estate taxes.\n\n\u201cWe find a sharp and economically large increase in estate tax revenues in the three years after a Forbes billionaire death,\u201d the study said. \u201cWe estimate that, on average, a Forbes billionaire death results in an increase in state estate revenues of $165 million.\u201d\n\nAre estate taxes worth it?\n\nThe study\u2019s final section examined whether the estate taxes (or inheritance taxes, which tax after distribution to heirs, unlike estate taxes, which tax before) were worth it, despite the fact that they often drive the very rich out of the states that levy them. (The paper estimates the average effective estate tax rate at 10%.) For it to be worth it, the amount of foregone tax revenue after a billionaire leaves \u2014 as well as potential new billionaires moving to a state without a tax \u2014 must be smaller than what the estate tax would bring in. (Currently, 12 states and the District of Columbia have an estate tax. Other states, including Delaware, New Jersey, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee recently repealed their estate taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center.)", "description": "A new report found that state estate taxes drive away billionaires but are worth it, with one exception.", "authors": ["Ethan Wolff-Mann", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ctwZZBtkP4nfQpBE_sjiRg--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/54793470-f665-11e9-bf6e-708b2f522681", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
