And then immediately pivoted to spon con? That happened in January \u2014 so ancient history in Instagram years \u2014 but the egg is still there, sending \u201cgood vibes only\u201d to its 7.9 million followers.\n\nI never forgot about @world_record_egg. There\u2019s something so soothing about its perfect oval shape, smooth exterior, and fleshy tone. I want to hold it in the palm of my hand and tell it that, like millions of others, I too, am still #EGGGANG.\n\nFashion hasn\u2019t forgotten about the egg, either, it seems. During New York Fashion Week, eggs played a prominent role in the Puppets and Puppets show, with models walking on egg cartons, in addition to wearing bulbous, egg-shaped silhouettes. In addition to egg-shaped gowns, the color of eggs \u2014 the shells of organic brown eggs, specifically \u2014 has been incorporated into a number of collections, from Gucci to Fendi. None were as brilliant, though, as the Masked Singer wearing an egg hat on top of its egg-shaped head. Designers, take note.\n\nBelow, a sampling of egg-inspired looks from the spring 2020 collections.\n\nSimone Rocha spring 2020. Photo: Estrop/WireImage\n\nFendi spring 2020.
