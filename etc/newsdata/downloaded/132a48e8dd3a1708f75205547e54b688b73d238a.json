Maryanne Miller, head of Air Mobility Command, confirmed the Air Force's newest tanker aircraft, made by Boeing Co., won't be likely to deploy to a combat zone for at least three years. Additionally, AMC may ask the Air Force to slow the retirement of older KC-10 Extender and KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft, Miller said Wednesday.\n\n\"I'd love to slow down the retirement because I have to keep [refueling] booms in the air, but we'll see how this requirement plays out,\" Miller told reporters during a roundtable discussion here at the annual Air, Space and Cyber conference.\n\nThe deployment pause and potential retirement delay is due to unsolved technical deficiencies in the KC-46 including a glitch with the software inside the Remote Vision System. The RVS permits the in-flight operator to view the refueling system below the tanker.\n\n\"It's my hope that Boeing recognizes and shares my level of concern and urgency in this matter,\" Miller said.\n\nA KC-46A Pegasus during testing with a C-5M Super Galaxy for the first time on April 29, 2019.

The first tankers were delivered despite that problem.\n\n\"Eight months have passed since our first delivery, and Boeing has not made any progress in addressing those [Category 1] deficiencies,\" she said.\n\n\"Boeing has not presented a solution that has met all the parameters,\" she said of the RVS, but added there is now \"hard science\" to diagnose the problem. \"In a couple months ... what I'm looking for [is] a pass-fail grade for Boeing on this,\" she said.\n\nA KC-46 Pegasus takes its first flight at Paine Field in Everett, Washington, September 25, 2015. U.S. Air Force photo/Jet Fabara\n\nWhile Miller didn't describe the characteristics behind each box the aerospace company has to check, she said the Air Force had nine total requirements.\n\nThe general said she chose not to send the KC-46 to the latest AMC-led Mobility Guardian airlift exercise in Washington in order for airmen to get more acquainted with the few aircraft they have.\n\nThe Air Force has only accepted 19 KC-46 aircraft since January. The planes have been delivered to McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas, and Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma.\n\nKC-46 deliveries have also been halted or delayed a number of times this year over the discovery of foreign object debris\u2014 trash, tools, nuts and bolts, and other miscellaneous items \u2014 scattered inside the aircraft. Loose objects are dangerous because they can cause damage over time.\n\nMiller said Boeing now has procedures in place to avoid FOD.\n\n\"We will work through these,\" she said of overall technical problems. \"The pressure is on to get [the KC-46] into the fight. Out teams will work together to get to the solutions to get this into the fight.\"\n\n\u2014 Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.
