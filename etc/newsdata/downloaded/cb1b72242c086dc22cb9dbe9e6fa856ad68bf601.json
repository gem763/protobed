However, during the Chapter 2 downtime, players could stare at the black hole and the random numbers that were appearing on the screen. Apparently, according to Epic Games, this has turned out to be the \"most viewed gaming event ever\" across Twitch, YouTube, and Twitter.\n\nThe event wasn't very fun, but it was popular\n\nBefore the Black Hole appeared in \"Fortnite Battle Royale,\" players could witness the season-ending event that started in Dusty Depot.
