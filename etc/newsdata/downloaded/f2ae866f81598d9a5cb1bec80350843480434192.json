I figured out how people love at different stages of life. While we all know how teenage love is, relationships in your late twenties show you a completely different side of love.\n\nNow that I've matured and grown as an individual, relationships are not tasking anymore. I try to keep it simple because my relationship is not the only thing in my life.\n\nHere are a few things I don't give a damn about in a relationship anymore.\n\n1. I don't feel like sending or receiving 'good morning' texts from my partner.\n\nUnsplash\n\n2. I don't want to know where my partner is going or who is he meeting on a daily basis.\n\nUnsplash\n\n3. I do not want to hear 'I love you' from my partner. The constant validation is not required.\n\nUnsplash\n\nDon't Miss 1 K SHARES 317 SHARES 5 K SHARES 568 SHARES 518 SHARES\n\n4. I understand how alone time is also needed and is dear to individuals. I do not interpret is as 'he doesn't need me anymore.'\n\nUnsplash\n\n5. So what if my partner is not there at a party I am going to?\n\nUnsplash\n\n6. I do not react to every little detail even if it bothers me. I'd like to keep myself calm which eventually makes me think better.\n\nUnsplash\n\n7. I do not throw unnecessary tantrums to create more chaos in my life just because something terrible at work happened.\n\nUnsplash\n\n8. I am comfortable with complete silence around my partner.\n\nUnsplash\n\n9. I do not make my partner take decisions about his life around me because that is not the right way.\n\nUnsplash\n\n10. I do not have to buy sexy lingerie to have that brilliant session with my partner.\n\nUnsplash\n\n11. I do not feel the need to have someone to complete me. I am complete with myself and it does not question my love for my partner.\n\nUnsplash", "description": "The definition of a relationship has now changed for me.
