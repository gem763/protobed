Not for the faint-hearted, or for those with any whiff of vertigo, the glass structure stretches 488 metres between two steep cliffs and is paved with more than a thousand panels of glass.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A visitor poses for a photograph on the world\u2019s highest and longest glass-bottomed bridge above a valley in Zhangjiajie in Hunan province.

In Guangxi province this year, a glass slide became lethal after rainfall led a man to crash into the railing when going down and fall over the side. He died from severe head injuries, while six others were injured. There have also been reports of tourists being hit on a glass bridge by flying debris.\n\nIn August 2016, the world\u2019s highest and longest glass walkway opened to great fanfare, linking two cliffs in central Hunan province in China\u2019s spectacular Zhangjiajie mountains \u2013 the inspiration for the Hollywood film Avatar. But the vast glass structure, which stretches 430m long and is made of 99 panels of glass, was open for just 13 days before being shut for an \u201curgent upgrade\u201d after it could not handle the weight of all the visitors. The bridge had been built to hold 8,000 visitors a day, but demand exceeded that tenfold.\n\nIt followed a huge publicity campaign to demonstrate the safety of the glass bridge, which included people being encouraged to try and smash the bridge\u2019s panels with a sledgehammer, and another stunt where a car was driven across the Zhangjiajie bridge.\n\nThe Chinese government has now called on authorities to carry out comprehensive safety checks on all glass structures, but it could be a momentous task, with an estimated 2,300 glass bridges alone in China, as well as more glass walkways and slides.", "description": "Series of injuries and deaths prompts closure of 32 glass-bottomed attractions in Hebei", "authors": ["Hannah Ellis-Petersen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8b133cc2df831b7ac0d11a39e9a51a77e208f40/0_37_4990_2995/master/4990.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fef5e7491ae746dceb6893ef6388e3c0", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
