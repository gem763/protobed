She proposed raising the levy \u2014 the total amount of property tax the city collects \u2014 by 5.5 percent, or $17.3 million.\n\nHodges and all the City Council members are in the midst of a re-election campaign, and, as usual, the budget won\u2019t be finalized by the City Council until after the election in December.\n\nCalling climate change \u201cthe single greatest threat to our city and our planet,\u201d Hodges said, \u201cit is up to cities like ours to lead both the fight against climate change and the work to adapt to it.\u201d She proposed spending $6 million on clean energy programs; her budget would help pay for those initiatives by raising utility franchise fees by half a percent, which would cost the typical household about 57 cents per month.\n\nTwin Cities Pioneer Press: Mayoral candidate Dai Thao won\u2019t be charged in bribery-solicitation case\n\nAfter reviewing the results of a Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigation, the Scott County attorney\u2019s office has declined to file criminal charges against St. Paul City Council member Dai Thao, who is also a mayoral candidate.\n\nSt. Paul police had asked the BCA to investigate allegations against the council member involving a failed bribery solicitation.\n\n\u201cThe mere request for a campaign donation, without some evidence of a proposed quid pro quo, is not illegal,\u201d states a Tuesday letter from the Scott County attorney\u2019s office to the BCA.\n\nReached by phone Tuesday evening, Thao said he was still preparing public comments in response to the case and had no immediate comment.\n\nMinnesota Public Radio: Dayton: Amazon bid to be \u2018restrained\u2019\n\nGov. Mark Dayton put some parameters Tuesday around Minnesota\u2019s upcoming bid for the new Amazon corporate headquarters, saying the state will be \u201crestrained\u201d when it comes to tax and financial incentives.\n\nThe Democratic governor stressed that Minnesota, with a vibrant economy and heralded labor force, has an attractive case to make for the e-commerce retailer\u2019s second North American headquarters. But Dayton said any proposal must benefit the state more than Amazon.\n\nPlus, Dayton said, the state needs to be mindful about being unfair to existing corporations with Minnesota headquarters. Target and Best Buy are at the top of the list given that they compete directly with Amazon in the retailing space.\n\n\u201cI think they and at least some of their 32,000 employees would look properly with askance at our taking some of their tax dollars to offer special incentives they don\u2019t receive to lure some major competitor to their doorstep,\u201d Dayton said.", "description": "Minneapolis StarTribune:\u00a0Climate change, housing, public safety headline Hodges\u2019 2018 Minneapolis .09/02/2019 3:06:15AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
