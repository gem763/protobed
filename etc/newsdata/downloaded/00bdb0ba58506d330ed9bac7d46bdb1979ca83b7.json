Guns don\u2019t kill people \u2014 Darwin kills people!\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here? Pardon my cynicism, but I seriously doubt that Barr, whose boss must be the least godly man ever to occupy the White House, has suddenly realized to his horror that America is becoming more secular. No, this outburst of God-talk is surely a response to the way the walls are closing in on Trump, the high likelihood that he will be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nTrump\u2019s response to his predicament has been to ramp up the ugliness in an effort to rally his base. The racism has gotten even more explicit, the paranoia about the deep state more extreme. But who makes up Trump\u2019s base? The usual answer is working-class whites, but a deeper dive into the data suggests that it\u2019s more specific: It\u2019s really evangelical working-class whites who are staying with Trump despite growing evidence of his malfeasance and unsuitability for high office.\n\nAnd at a more elite level, while a vast majority of Republican politicians have meekly fallen in line behind Trump, his truly enthusiastic support comes from religious leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr., who have their own ethical issues, but have called on their followers to \u201crender to God and Trump.\u201d\n\nPatriotism, Samuel Johnson famously declared, is the last refuge of scoundrels. But for all his talk of America first, that\u2019s not a refuge that works very well for Trump, with his subservience to foreign autocrats and, most recently, his shameful betrayal of the Kurds.\n\nSo Trump is instead taking shelter behind bigotry \u2014 racial, of course, but now religious as well.\n\nWill it work? There is a substantial minority of Americans with whom warnings about sinister secularists resonate. But they are a minority. Over all, we\u2019re clearly becoming a more tolerant nation, one in which people have increasingly positive views of others\u2019 religious beliefs, including atheism.\n\nSo the efforts of Trump\u2019s henchmen to use the specter of secularism to distract people from their boss\u2019s sins probably won\u2019t work. But I could be wrong. And if I am wrong, if religious bigotry turns out to be a winning strategy, all I can say is, God help us.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
