Until now.\n\nIn the space of mere hours Australia has managed to welcome its first two neobanks \u2014 digital banks with no physical presence \u2014 to the market. On Monday, Xinja launched to become the first to publicly offer transaction accounts.\n\nREAD MORE: Neobank Xinja just won an unrestricted licence and began its bid to lure millennials away from the big banks\n\nOn Tuesday, 86 400 closely followed.\n\n\u201c[Today] we\u2019re launching a fully-featured transaction account and a savings account with an interest rate of 2.5% as long as you deposit $1,000 a month in either,\u201d 86 400 CEO Robert Bell told Business Insider Australia.\n\n86 400 \u2014 named after the number of seconds in a day \u2014 received its full banking licence in July and managed to turn around its app in just seven weeks. Not to be outdone, Xinja \u2014 which had been operating on a restricted licence \u2014 was granted a full banking licence on Monday and immediately launched its products to the public, pipping 86 400 by just hours.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia just got a new digital bank called 86 400 and its chair has a history of taking on the big end of town\n\nThe last of the trio is Volt which, despite having received the first full banking licence in Australia of the three, is yet to launch publicly and offer banking services.\n\nThe 86 400 app (Supplied)\n\nThat journey has been anything but quick, Bell said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been effectively running a bank for six months over which time we\u2019ve been operating with staff as customers. We\u2019re actually already up to our 29th version of the app,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we got our full banking licence seven weeks ago, we put out the app within 48 hours and could get 5,000 early users onto it for testing. Now we\u2019re happy to launch to the whole of Australia.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, it and Xinja will be the first taste the country has of neobanks.\n\nThe class of new challenger banks promise to be cheaper, faster and smarter than the unwieldy big banks. They say that with no physical branches to maintain, their lower overheads mean more savings for customers. With no old tech weighing them down, their apps should help you to manage your money faster and smarter.\n\nThat goes for everything from signing up for an account as well as all the traditional banking functions you require.\n\n\u201cYou can download the app on the app store and sign up in two minutes. The digital identification is done in real-time so you use your passport or driver\u2019s licence and that\u2019s all you need. We literally designed it so you can actually do it sitting at the bus stop,\u201d Bell said.\n\nOnce completed you\u2019ll instantly have access to your two \u2018Pay\u2019 and \u2018Save\u2019 accounts and an aqua-coloured Visa debit card will be on its way to you in the mail.\n\nIn the meantime, you\u2019ll have access to Apple/ Google / Samsung/ Fitbit and/or Garmin Pay as you see fit. Payments are made by Osko, making it near-instantaneous to transfer money to a friend for a round of beers for example.\n\n86400 CEO Robert Bell and chair Anthony Thomson (Supplied)\n\nYou\u2019ll have free cash withdrawals from 10,000 ATMs in Australia and just like any fully-licensed bank in Australia, deposits up to $250,000 are guaranteed by the Australian government.\n\nLacking the brand and branches, Australians might feel sceptical of a neobank and the security of their money but they promise to be as secure as any of the big four.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the same security you\u2019d expect at any bank. You\u2019ve got a passcode to log in and you can choose one for each of your devices. We also have biometrics so you can use your face ID or fingerprint,\u201d digital product Bryce Guderjahn said.\n\n86400 is Australia\u2019s latest digital bank (Supplied)\n\nThen there is the app itself.\n\n\u201cWe know Australians have relationships with multiple banks and there\u2019s more money coming and going automatically than ever before. So we give you a full picture of your finances to understand exactly how you\u2019re tracking across all your different accounts,\u201d Bell said.\n\n\u201cThat helps customers feel less anxious and more in control of their situation.\u201d\n\nThat means you should be able to see your next Netflix subscription payment or electricity bill before it drops, helping you get ahead of the curve and ahead with your money.\n\n\u201cAustralians waste about $2.7 billion a year on unused subscriptions so those kind of reminders are vital to make sure you\u2019re not flushing money away,\u201d Bell said.\n\nThat\u2019s just one major feature that neobanks hope draw customers over to help you save and spend, as well as offering other helpful nudges.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve deposited just $999 and the end of the month is coming up, we\u2019ll send you a reminder to top it up to $1,000 so you get the bonus interest. What neobanks are really about is having the customers\u2019 interest at heart, not our own profits,\u201d Bell said.\n\nIt\u2019s that idea, on top of all the bells and whistles, that 86 400 and its ilk hope to convince Australia to switch from a big bank and go digital.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
