Could Amazon bring them together?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nAmazon is launching a headquarters campus in Arlington that will eventually employ 25,000 people. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg)\n\nAmazon\u2019s arrival in Northern Virginia may do something that hasn\u2019t happened in more than 100 years \u2014 bring Arlington County and the city of Alexandria together in the way that they govern their communities.\n\nThe elected leaders of these two inside-the-Beltway suburbs, which split in the 1870s and adopted their current identities when Arlington County was renamed in 1920, are considering whether to create a joint entity to boost affordable housing, expedite transit plans and train its workforce, hoping to ensure that the benefits Amazon brings don\u2019t outweigh the challenges.\n\nAlexandria Mayor Justin Wilson and Arlington County Board Chair Christian Dorsey, both Democrats, said in a joint interview that they want to cooperate on ways to deal with the growth and disruption expected with the arrival of Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, Virginia Tech\u2019s new graduate campus and related developments.\n\nThe Alexandria City Council and the Arlington County Board will meet in a rare combined session Oct. 1 to talk about the possibilities.\n\n\n\nAlexandria Mayor Justin Wilson (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThis is directly responsive to the concern that this is going to be an investment that is only going to benefit small segments of our community,\u201d Wilson said, as Dorsey nodded vigorously. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear, and there is data from other communities, that that\u2019s possible, so we\u2019re looking at how do we best position both communities to benefit from all of it.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s selection of Crystal City, Pentagon City and Potomac Yard to be the home for its HQ2 last November triggered both euphoria from government and economic development officials and fear from lower-income residents, who focused on the traffic jams and housing shortages that accompanied the retail giant\u2019s growth in Seattle. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n[Amazon in Seattle: Economic godsend or self-centered behemoth?]\n\nRents spiked immediately after the announcement, home sale prices rose and activists staged protests, even as community opposition to a parallel campus in New York City prompted Amazon to reject that deal.\n\nNow the potential impact of adding at least 25,000 new employees in the next decade is beginning to settle in. Five thousand potential applicants came to Crystal City for Amazon\u2019s first Career Day last week, even though the company was offering only information about itself and not taking resumes or hiring on the spot.\n\n\n\nThousands of job-seekers gather for Amazon Career Day at the Grounds in Arlington on Tuesday. Billed as the nation's largest job fair, the event featured informational and networking events in Arlington, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Nashville and Seattle. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nAmy Liu, director of the metropolitan policy program at the Brookings Institution, said the infusion of new workers, residents and businesses could go bad quickly if elected leaders don\u2019t act with \u201cintentionality.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a strong, single elected executive, especially in Arlington where the county chair rotates every year ... there is a legitimate concern raised by citizens that Amazon could muscle or strong-arm the governing structure,\u201d Liu said.\n\n\n\nArlington County Board Chairman Christian Dorsey (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nDorsey said it became clear \u201cpretty quickly\u201d last November that the two proudly separate communities should work together on major concerns about housing, traffic and other issues.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be caught flat-footed and reacting to market forces that make it difficult to shape anything that\u2019s meaningful to people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two elected leaders want to consider whether their communities should use the same set of planning and zoning rules, for example, or allow developers to trade development rights between the city and county \u2014 perhaps allowing more density for a project in one jurisdiction in exchange for building affordable housing in the other.\n\nMany landowners and developers, and most housing nonprofit agencies, work in both Alexandria and Arlington. At times it\u2019s hard for anyone to tell which community they are in \u2014 unless they are clued in to the color of street signs (Alexandria\u2019s are blue, Arlington\u2019s are white).\n\nWilson and Dorsey specifically mentioned the Arlandria/Chirilauga neighborhood of Alexandria and Columbia Pike neighborhoods of Arlington as among the most vulnerable to gentrification Amazon\u2019s well-paid employees may bring.\n\nThat makes it important to preserve and expand affordable housing, as the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments said earlier this month, but also to educate, certify and train existing residents so they can take advantage of the opportunities that arise.\n\n[Amazon deal delivers \u2018certainty\u2019 for key NoVa transportation projects]\n\nThe real estate sector is already worried about finding enough highly trained construction workers in Northern Virginia, Liu said, and local governments could coordinate certification programs or internships and apprenticeships through high schools, community colleges and universities. Amazon has already pledged to work with schools to help build a \u201ctech pipeline.\u201d\n\nDorsey and Wilson said they are looking into setting up some kind of public organization that could be a clearinghouse for initiatives and serve as a magnet for investment from the federal government, the commonwealth nonprofit agencies and foundations.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I fear is if we\u2019ve got a whole bunch of people doing good stuff, but they are not really connected and cohesive and working towards one goal, it\u2019s going to be fairly diluted and the impact will be diluted,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cLet\u2019s give everyone a place where they can devote their resources instead of saying, [should we go to] the Community Foundation of Arlington or the Alexandria association?\u201d\n\nOther cities are figuring this out as well. Liu pointed to Louisville and Lexington, Ky., which formed the Bluegrass Economic Advancement Movement to develop a joint regional business plan that supports adding high-quality jobs in advanced manufacturing.\n\nWhatever form this effort takes \u2014 a community development corporation, a regional housing authority, a joint task force led by elected leaders from both communities \u2014 Dorsey and Wilson said they believe they need to act quickly. Dorsey said residents must have a strong say in what projects are pursued, and opportunities to help shape them.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of foundations, nonprofits and think tanks that are watching how the D.C. area, specifically how Alexandria and Arlington, handle this significant investment,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThey see us as a kind of proving ground, a test ground for how a community can handle a large investment.\u201d\n\n\n\nA line of people snakes a full block and around the corner as thousands of job-seekers gather for Amazon Career Day at The Grounds in Arlington. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe two communities have successfully cooperated in the past on a Four Mile Run restoration project, the Crystal City Potomac Yard bus transitway and the Potomac Yard Metro station. They worked together in the commonwealth-organized effort to lure Amazon, which has become a catalyst for more cooperation across Northern Virginia.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a history of each community being out for itself when it comes to economic development. Not so long ago, Arlingtonians gnashed their teeth over the relocations of the Transportation Security Agency and the National Science Foundation from Arlington to Alexandria\u2019s Eisenhower neighborhood (TSA later moved to Springfield, in Fairfax County).\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do beyond this effort is never, I hope, intentionally do things to a cripple a neighboring jurisdiction for our own benefit,\u201d Dorsey said.\n\nRead more:\n\nD.C. region\u2019s leaders face big challenges as they tackle affordable housing\n\nArea residents, not newcomers, are fueling real estate frenzy, agents say\n\nAmazon\u2019s \u2018Career Day\u2019 draws 5,000 before applications are even taken\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Mayor, county board chair mull how to get ahead of coming population boom.", "authors": ["Patricia Sullivan", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Other Regional Issues In Arlington County", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QeUhLGBtW5hoeeHPK1FrJdVxM5s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FYWSAOG33II6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
