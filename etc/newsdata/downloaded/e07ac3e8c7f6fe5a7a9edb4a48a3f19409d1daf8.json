REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Former Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) boss Carlos Ghosn denied any impropriety over payments he made during his time at the automaker, following a newspaper report that Japanese tax authorities determined he used company money for private use.\n\n\u201cMr. Ghosn categorically denies that there was anything improper about the payments or donations at issue, all of which were made for the benefit of Nissan,\u201d according to a statement issued by a spokesman.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing new in these allegations, which arise from inquiries by the tax authorities and taxes paid by Nissan years ago,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutors\u2019 decision to leak them now, only days after Mr. Ghosn publicly released court filings detailing extensive prosecutorial misconduct and previewing his defenses for the first time, is a transparent effort to distract from the failings of their case.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s Yomiuri reported on Tuesday the country\u2019s tax authorities had determined Ghosn used money for private use, bolstering the carmaker\u2019s case that he diverted corporate funds for personal gain.\n\nThe Japanese newspaper, without citing sources, said the National Tax Agency found Ghosn used Nissan money for several years to pay consultant fees to his sister for fictitious work and to make donations to a university in Lebanon.\n\nThe former Nissan chairman holds Lebanese nationality. He is awaiting trial in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies.", "description": "Former Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> boss Carlos Ghosn denied any impropriety over payments he made during his time at the automaker, following a newspaper report that Japanese tax authorities determined he used company money for private use.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446531287&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T136", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
