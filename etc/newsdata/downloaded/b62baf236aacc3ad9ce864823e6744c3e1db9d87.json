Buttigieg, who\u2019s plateaued in national polling, is looking to assemble a campaign in keeping with the staggering $25 million he raised last quarter. O\u2019Rourke, who\u2019s languished in low single-digit support, is trying to recapture his early mojo with a passionate crusade to curb gun violence.\n\nFollowing a debate last week at which O\u2019Rourke called for mandatory government buy-backs of assault weapons, Buttigieg was asked on CNN if O\u2019Rourke was \u201cplaying into the hands of Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Buttigieg answered.\n\n\"When even this president and even [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell are at least pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hands. Let\u2019s make the most of it and get these things done.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke. | Sandy Huffaker/Getty Image\n\n\u201cWell, shit,\u201d O\u2019Rourke responded, hours later, tearing into candidates he said are \u201ctriangulating, poll-testing, focus-group driving their response,\u201d adding that \u201cDonald Trump and Mitch McConnell pretending to be interested in something that is literally a life-or-death issue \u2026 is simply not enough.\u201d\n\nThen, after Trump said this week that he would not consider a universal background checks bill passed by the House, the Texas congressman rubbed it in.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, when asked during a campaign stop on Tuesday about Trump\u2019s spurning of Democrats on gun control. \u201cAnd Pete even admitted that Trump was only pretending, so why would you change your position, or moderate your position to meet someone who\u2019s only pretending half way.\u201d\n\nAsked in South Carolina about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s recent criticisms, Buttigieg said Tuesday he\u2019s \u201cfocused on what we can do right now, because I don\u2019t think we can wait.\u201d He also said he \u201ccould care less\u201d how Republicans might react to gun control reforms and that he\u2019s \u201ctalking not just about politics, but about governing\u201d and \u201cwhat we can do right now.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has \u201cconsistently\u201d supported background checks on gun sales, an assault weapons ban and red flag laws, said campaign spokesman Chris Meagher.\n\nO\u2019Rourke isn't the only Democrat supportive of mandatory buy-backs. Kamala Harris said on Jimmy Fallon\u2019s Tonight Show on Monday that a buyback program is a \u201cgood idea,\u201d and Cory Booker supports such a proposal.\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke is pressing the case for buy-backs most forcefully, and the opportunity to draw a contrast with Buttigieg is especially significant to his campaign. O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg are battling to be the choice of voters seeking a generational change. They are also young, white men who lean less heavily on their resumes than on their biographies and next-generation appeal.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what effect this sparring might have on their polling. A CNN national poll last week found O\u2019Rourke at 5 percent, while a Morning Consult survey on Monday had him at 4 percent, just 1 percentage point behind Buttigieg. But in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday, O\u2019Rourke failed to register above 1 percent, while Buttigieg rose to 7 percent.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2561/1155968404_6085821670001_6085821761001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nBut the back-and-forth may ultimately help both candidates as they struggle for oxygen in a primary dominated by the three top-polling candidates.\n\n\u201cPete\u2019s trying to, and has been all along, positioning himself as a pragmatic progressive. \u2026Beto has become a missionary for a cause, to stop gun violence, which is really admirable [but] the politics of that, and Beto knows this, are more complicated than that,\u201d said David Axelrod, who served as chief strategist for President Barack Obama. \u201cIn this fight, it probably serves both their purposes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a reminder that \u201cBeto was going to be the \u2018next generation\u2019 candidate, and Pete usurped that space, so it\u2019s not surprising to see this back-and-forth,\u201d Axelrod added.\n\nWatching O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg\u2019s sparring, one Democratic strategist involved with another presidential campaign scoffed, \u201cIsn\u2019t this like the Spiderman meme, where the two spider men are pointing at each other?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just two very similar characters trying to carry a very similar space in this battle,\u201d he added.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s supporters privately acknowledged their glee in the reemergence of headlines featuring their candidate\u2019s name alongside Buttigieg\u2019s. Many O\u2019Rourke loyalists still grouse about the day this spring when Buttigieg, gently chiding O\u2019Rourke for his habit at the time of standing on chairs and tables, told a crowd in New Hampshire, \u201cI heard the way you ingratiate yourself to voters is to stand on things, so I found this park bench here.\u201d\n\nAnd they know that slicing into Buttigieg could help O\u2019Rourke\u2019s cause now.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Buttigieg has been thought of in a higher tier or strata than O\u2019Rourke \u2026 and there\u2019s usually very little value in punching down,\u201d said Chris Lippincott, a Texas-based consultant who ran a super PAC opposing Sen. Ted Cruz in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s near-miss Senate campaign last year. \u201c[But] O\u2019Rourke has elevated his idea and his campaign with this policy proposal, and that will force other candidates to respond.\u201d\n\nRep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who's endorsed Buttigieg, said the Indiana mayor is \"doing his best to deescalate the confrontation\u201d because \u201che wants to stay focused on the bigger picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cNinety-eight percent [of the time] Pete and Beto agree,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difference between what\u2019s possible in the near term, the next two years, and what\u2019s possible over 10 years or more.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a stylistic contrast \u201cbetween a mayor, whose main emphasis is on figuring out really specific, concrete things to advance the ball and a legislator, who is speaking in, perhaps, more aspirational terms,\u201d said Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who endorsed Buttigieg over his fellow Texan.\n\nGun control activists are split on whether mandatory buy-back programs would prove as effective as other reforms like background checks and red flag laws. But a spokesman for Everytown for Gun Safety told Fox News that though \u201cpresidential candidates are talking about a number of policies to address gun violence in America,\u201d background checks and a federal red flag laws \u201cneed to be the Senate\u2019s first priorities.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke drew newfound attention after the mass shooting at a Walmart in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, including for his mandatory buy-back proposal.\n\nDemocratic strategist Mathew Littman, a former Biden speechwriter who works on gun reform issues, said Democrats should \u201cstart on the areas that we agree upon\u201d on gun control, including universal background checks and \u201cred-flag\u201d laws.\n\nBut Littman, who now backs Kamala Harris in the primary, said O\u2019Rourke is \u201cgetting a lot of attention now that he hadn\u2019t been getting previously.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s staked out a position in the Democratic primary that is a little bit different than everybody else\u2019s,\u201d Littman said, \u201cand he\u2019s benefiting from it.\u201d", "description": "A spat over gun control has revived the rivalry between the next-gen hopefuls.", "authors": ["David Siders", "Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f1/99/794fcae544e88beec8ab6d05b30b/190917-buttigieg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
