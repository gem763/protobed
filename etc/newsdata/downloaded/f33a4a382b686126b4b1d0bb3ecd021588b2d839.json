Tests showed participants\u2019 hearts were pumping blood around the body more efficiently.\n\nLead researcher Professor Naresh Sen, from Jaipur, said: \u201cPatients in the yoga arm undertook three months of a new daily one-hour programme specifically designed for cardiac patients, incorporating yoga and \u00admeditation in the morning, and a pattern of breathing exercises, comprising slow and fast-breathing elements, in the evening.\n\n\u201cYoga and breathing exercises may reduce metabolic stress, reduce oxygen demand and prevent \u00adventricular remodelling [damage to the heart].\u201d\n\nYoga performed well given that the trial involved patients who had suffered the most serious type of heart attack, where one of the major arteries is blocked.\n\nAll had undergone surgery to widen the vessels, using a stent to allow blood to flow more freely.\n\nHalf the patients were then put on a three-month programme of yoga.\n\nOver the next five years, the patients in the yoga group were 16% less likely to die. There was an unexpected bonus too, heart performance was improved, with an 11% boost to its ability to pump blood round the body.\n\nThose who didn\u2019t do yoga saw an increase of only 4%.\n\nProfessor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \u201cPractising yoga can help to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, which increase risk of heart and circulatory diseases.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a lot of evidence that yoga can help to relieve stress and improve mental health, giving us less of a reason to make unhealthy lifestyle choices, such us smoking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not much of a stretch to see why this might improve survival if you\u2019ve suffered a heart attack.\u201d", "description": "Yoga could be a life saver for \u00adpeople recovering from a heart attack, with studies showing those who do an hour of breathing exercises and gentle movement daily were 16% less likely to die", "authors": ["Miriam Stoppard", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19808673.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Meditation-is-how-I-stay-focused-in-life.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
