But they knew there was a product-market fit.\n\nIn the same year, the two entrepreneurs joined the Techstars accelerator program, and AdHawk was the earliest-stage company there. Because ad tech was both a competitive space and an industry many investors had been burned by in the past, Saunders and Pratt faced rejection time and time again.\n\nAnd the rejections didn't stop after they completed the accelerator program \u2014 the duo was rejected by 37 more VCs.\n\n\"It was a pretty tough pill to swallow, but for us, we believed in what we were doing. We had talked to enough customers that we understood the problem, and we solved customers' pain points,\" Saunders said.\n\nSo they kept at it, and eventually they had their first commitment from an investor for $100,000 \u2014 until a week later when he dropped out because he wasn't confident in the investment. Not only was this a blow to the company, but it meant the founders had to face the other people who had signed on as a result of this initial investor.\n\n\"It's terrifying. It's something that is humbling and a little bit humiliating,\" Saunders said about the experience. But the duo knew what they had to do.\n\n\"When we found out the investor backed out, we went to our lead investor and were very honest about it. We had no other choice and it was honestly the best decision we made. Our lead investor ended up putting in more money to cover the rest of the round and was more than excited to do so,\" Saunders said.\n\nAt this point, they had heard from multiple investors that they needed to focus on one industry because they didn't think the business would survive in the competitive market if it focused on small businesses in general.\n\nTheir first customer, FloorForce, helped them do just that.\n\n\"Through working with them we saw a huge opportunity to offer a fully vertical SaaS solution to an underserved niche,\" Saunders said.\n\nAfter working with FloorForce as a customer, AdHawk acquired the business in early 2019 \u2014 something the two entrepreneurs had never predicted.\n\nOnce AdHawk had a niche (the flooring industry), things took off. Those 37 investors who rejected them were now looking to get in on their latest round of funding, which totaled $13 million. The company has now raised a total of $17.7 million in funding, generates $23 million in recurring revenue each year, and employs over 100 people.\n\n\"Don't go out looking for a niche. Keep your head down and focus on building a great product and testing it with many different types of customers. Let the market and customers tell you they want it,\" Saunders advised other founders.", "description": "From getting rejected from 37 VCs to being turned down by the bank \u2014 twice \u2014 these four founders overcame the odds to become wildly successful.", "authors": ["Deja Leonard"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d2dcaa2a17d6c1bc7469e04-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
