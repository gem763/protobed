Not a single subplot was left unresolved. It\u2019s not merely that it allowed him to take to the stage in triumph not once, but twice, at the premature end of a 72 hour rolling clusterf**k.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere was also the fact that the untimely de-prorogation of parliament allowed him to bump Tom Watson off the conference schedule entirely. Four days previously, he\u2019d tried and failed to chuck him out the shadow cabinet. This would have to do. Revenge is the dish that\u2019s meant to be served cold. Blatant spite works just as well, it turns out.\n\nA word on \u201cdemocracy\u201d while we\u2019re here. That is a word that takes a lot of abuse all round the world, from the Korean peninsula to the Congo basin, but the Labour Party\u2019s treatment of it over four mindbending days has been, well, unique.\n\nOn the radio on Tuesday morning, we would learn that Diane Abbott and Rebecca Long-Bailey had voted to have Tom Watson slung from the shadow cabinet because it was important to allow the party\u2019s NEC to \u201cdebate the subject\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stifle democracy,\u201d Ms Long-Bailey said.\n\nI mean, yeah. The Labour Party members directly elected Tom Watson as their deputy leader. As if abolishing his position wasn\u2019t already shameless enough, here we were, being told to believe it was all about not stifling democracy.\n\nJeremy Corbyn is still maintaining he can, as prime minister, lead the country through a second referendum on Brexit without expressing an opinion on the matter himself. That\u2019s the Labour Party\u2019s actual policy now, adopted via a show of hands in the conference hall, in which the verdict of the person whose job it was to actually count the hands was overruled by the general secretary of the party.\n\nStill, it was, in its way, nice to see the debate narrowed again, even if it was by force. It was widened to such devastating effect in 2015 that the nation has never really recovered.\n\nAs Corbyn wandered on to the stage, the rapturous masses were treated to a pre-roll video of his unlikely leadership election victory, all the way back, several hundred thousand lifetimes and a mere four years ago.\n\nIndeed, perhaps the most revealing moment of the entire conference was during John McDonnell\u2019s speech, when he referred to Mr Corbyn having \u201caccidentally\u201d become leader of the Labour Party.\n\nAdd this to David Cameron \u201caccidentally\u201d taking his country out the EU and you have a pretty solid title for the eventual 180-part tragi-farce docudrama of the times in which we live. Britain: The Accidental Years.\n\nSo many and varied have been the accidents since that, in a room full of people capable of registering even a blip on the self-awareness scale, it might theoretically have been possible to wonder whether this moment and the rolling thermonuclear s**tshow that have followed it are related.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They were on their feet. The Messiah stood before them. They punched their fists in his direction, hundreds of them, and shouted \u201cJohnson Out! Johnson Out! Johnson Out!\u201d Their love for the man cannot be questioned, but it was an excessive request all the same. Mercifully, Corbyn did not oblige.\n\nIt was the usual stuff. Vote for me and my superior moral virtue. \u201cBoris Johnson and his wealthy friends are not just on the side of the establishment. They are the establishment.\u201d\n\nThree days previously, Labour made the abolition of private schools formal party policy. The momentum from the policy had come, literally, from Momentum, who had made much of its passing through its vast social media channels.\n\nIt could make for awkward scenes at the next Highgate School reunion if Momentum founder Jon Lansman decided to attend. But then, it\u2019s not hypocritical to have been to a private school and be in favour of their abolition. It\u2019s possible to believe in fairness while simultaneously being the beneficiary of unfairness.\n\nIt\u2019s just that, well, the whole sort of narrative around it. The whole thing about talentless people, failing upwards in life in to positions of power and influence far beyond their abilities. Jeremy Corbyn, to take just one example, recently did not know the difference between a hedge fund and a loan shark, and nevertheless could well be prime minister by the end of the year.\n\nCan you really be sure that you\u2019re one of the statistical outliers here? If you\u2019re having doubts about whether private school people get where they get on merit, can you really be sure you\u2019re not having doubts about yourself? Not on this evidence.\n\nEvents in London caused the speech to be hastily rewritten. In such circumstances, Corbyn did well to deviate from the script handed out just moments before and, in thanking his wife, also managing to turn it into a dig at the media.\n\nThat\u2019s been a theme of Labour Conference 2019. Dawn Butler thinks there is a \u201cMSM conspiracy\u201d not to cover the story of Boris Johnson\u2019s curious relationship with a businesswoman who\u2019s received thousands of pounds in public money while he was mayor and whose Shoreditch flat he would \u2013 reportedly \u2013 sometimes pop to on quiet afternoons in the working week.\n\nHow the conspiracy fits in to the story being the result of an investigation by the Murdoch-owned Sunday Times was not made clear.\n\nCorbyn himself made a little viral video of himself on Sunday afternoon, brazenly claiming that Andrew Marr\u2019s failure to ask Dominic Raab about the allegations was because \u201cthat is what the establishment do. They close ranks\u201d.\n\nIt could be that, Jeremy. Could also be that there were mere hours between the story breaking and the Marr Show starting, and BBC never repeat allegations they\u2019ve not stood up themselves. (The morning after the Snowden files were published by the Guardian in 2013, they didn\u2019t even get a mention on the Today programme.)\n\nThen there was Len McCluskey, pointing his finger in the face of Sky News\u2019s Beth Rigby, and telling her to \u201cstop telling lies, you should be ashamed of yourself\u201d, as she told the on-the-record, verbatim truth to him about what Jon Lansman had said the day before.\n\nThis litany of shameful stuff might actually have shamed them, had the Supreme Court not rescued them by heaping yet greater shame upon their top political rival.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to have seen some of the acts done in its name over this very long weekend in Brighton to know that democracy is a blunt instrument. There\u2019s an election coming. The people, ultimately, can only play the cards they\u2019re dealt. The public are going to have to vote for someone.\n\nThere were some big policies there, too. A carbon-neutral economy by 2030, entailing nothing short of the complete rebuilding of the economy - gig news on a different day. People will like the sound of it. If they do it, it will dwarf anything that the not-un-green Barack Obama managed to achieve in two full terms. Not that one should be overly sceptical of course.\n\nThe prospect of a Eurosceptic of a three decades\u2019 standing, hoovering up the votes of Remainers over the promise of a second referendum when he personally did so much to sabotage the first, will not seem entirely real until it\u2019s happened. It\u2019ll be too late then, of course.\n\nBritain: The Accidental Years might just be about to move up a gear.", "description": "As bits of blinding good fortune go, the Supreme Court verdict turned up at the Labour Party conference in much the same way as the Harrison \u201clesser watch\u201d appeared in Derek and Rodney Trotter\u2019s garage.\u00a0 Even now, when one considers Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s outrageous luck, it is hard not to see him exultantly punching the roof of a Robin Reliant van.", "authors": ["Tom Peck"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/16/jeremy-corbyn-speech.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
