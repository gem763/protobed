The Welsh attack is a potent force, capable of puncturing holes in the sturdiest of defences. To therefore see it operating in this fashion was a joy to watch.\n\nBut as the Kiwi admitted afterwards, Wales\u2019 inability to keep the game a closed affair points to the work that still needs to be done. \u201cIt was a little bit messy,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cGeorgia came pretty hard at us in the second half and defended a bit better. To concede those two tries was disappointing.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

In truth, Sunday\u2019s showdown will be the real indicator of where Wales stand. Prior to the beginning of the tournament, Gatland had praised this squad as the strongest he\u2019s ever assembled for a World Cup. Beat the Wallabies \u2013 something Wales have never managed before on this stage \u2013 and you feel there may be something to his words.\n\nBut after Monday\u2019s win, as well as Australia\u2019s own battling victory over Fiji, it\u2019s hard to discern a clear victor. Both have an abundance of talent at their disposal with which to batter and wear down their opponents. Both have a potential for lapses in concentration. The set piece, in particular, looks set to play a central role in determining the flow of Sunday\u2019s match.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If Australia get their tactics right, the set piece could be the Wallabies\u2019 ticket to glory in Tokyo.\n\nLingering over this coming collision, and Wales\u2019 tournament as a whole, is the issue of injuries. The Welsh have more than coped without the experience and power of Toby Faletau \u2013 he was absent for their Six Nations victory earlier this year \u2013 but Dan Anscombe\u2019s late withdrawal ahead of the World Cup came as a major blow. In Dan Biggar they have a worthy replacement, but the wonder is how much better, how much more threatening the Welsh would have been with these players among their ranks.\n\nWales\u2019 second row options are perhaps the greatest concern. With Cory Hill due to fly home as he continues to struggle with a leg stress fracture, and Adam Beard recovering from appendix surgery, Alun Wyn Jones and Jake Ball are Gatland\u2019s only fully fit specialist locks. The Welsh are nonetheless hopeful that Beard will be able to feature this weekend but with match fitness an issue, it remains to be seen what role he will play. If either Jones or Ball fall victim to injury, alarm bells will start ringing.\n\nAll is well for now, and the Welsh will be optimistic of building upon Monday\u2019s opener to take the fight to Australia, but one slip and the Six Nations champions will find themselves walking a dangerous line. They cast a cautious eye forward knowing full well what defeat on Sunday and further injury could do to their World Cup hopes.\n\nScotland, in comparison, are already on the verge of derailment. The capitulation against Ireland on Sunday, effectively consigning them to a quarter-final face-off with New Zealand (assuming all results play out as predicted), set a woeful starting tone for their campaign.\n\nThe side\u2019s unfolding injury nightmare has simply added salt to the wounds. Their hopes of a respectable run here in Japan suffered a third major blow in as many days after scrum-half Ali Price was ruled out for the remainder of the tournament. He joins Hamish Watson, one of Scotland\u2019s most prized assets, in making an early journey back to the UK.\n\nMagnus Bradley steps in for Price but with the loss of two key players, combined with the disheartening nature of Sunday\u2019s defeat, Scotland have their work cut out for them. There had been plenty of hope and expectation surrounding this Scottish team, but that is quickly fading into the ether. A convincing win against Samoa on Monday is vital for restoring confidence levels. Anything but will amount to self-immolation.", "description": "Despite his side\u2019s six-try victory in Toyota, fuelled by a first-half blitz from which the Georgians never really recovered, Warren Gatland won\u2019t be getting ahead of himself.
