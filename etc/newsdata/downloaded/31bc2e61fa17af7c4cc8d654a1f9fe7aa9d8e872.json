I think the president will be very vocal against him,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cFor Jeff\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t want that. But I think that\u2019s the reality of what he\u2019s facing.\u201d\n\nByrne said Sessions\u2019s longevity and history of winning statewide races would nonetheless not be enough to counter the deep animosity that Trump \u2014 who enjoys soaring popularity among GOP primary voters in the state \u2014 still maintains for his former attorney general. And privately, other Republican officials familiar with the dynamics in the race agreed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president will take Sessions to the woodshed,\u201d one Alabama GOP official said.\n\nThe remarks from Byrne underscores the significant, Trump-sized challenge facing Sessions if he wages a bid for his old seat. He was unceremoniously dismissed by Trump last November, after months of fury from the president about Sessions\u2019s move to recuse himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections.\n\nAD\n\nThat recusal led to the appointment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, a decision that has prompted Trump to still, on occasion, complain about the former attorney general.\n\nRepublicans say that even despite his deeply soured relationship with Trump, Sessions has nonetheless continued to praise the president in private. And other Republicans in the state also warned that Trump would be a considerable liability for the former senator.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf I were him and I was gonna run, then I would see if I could patch up my relationship with the president,\u201d said Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), who has not endorsed a candidate in the race and has not spoken to Sessions about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible. Who knows.\u201d\n\nStill, Sessions \u2014 who has yet to make a final decision, according to a close ally of his \u2014 would instantly be a formidable candidate with a long record of handily winning statewide races in Alabama.\n\nAD\n\nHe has maintained nearly $2.5 million cash on hand in his Senate campaign account. Byrne has led the GOP field in fundraising, with just over $2.5 million cash on hand as of Sept. 30.\n\nAD\n\nThe incumbent in the race, Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), is considered by far to be the most vulnerable Senate Democrat on the ballot next November and is one of just two up for reelection in states that Trump won in 2016. Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by 28 percentage points in Alabama.\n\nIn addition to Byrne, the Republicans who have announced their candidates for the bid include former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, state Rep. Arnold Mooney and Roy Moore, who was the party\u2019s Senate candidate in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls in the 1970s. Moore has acknowledged interactions with the women but denied any sexual contact.\n\nTuberville and Byrne have led the others in both public and internal GOP polling. If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote in the March 3 primary, then the top two candidates will head toward a runoff on March 31.\n\nAD", "description": "Rep.
