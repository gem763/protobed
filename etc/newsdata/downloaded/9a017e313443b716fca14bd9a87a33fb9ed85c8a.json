Facebook denies that it made changes to its policy.\n\nA Facebook company spokesperson told Axios in a statement: \"Facebook believes political speech should be protected. If Sen. Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Even though political ads reportedly make up less than 5% of Facebook's revenues, the company has chosen to engage in political advertising because it falls in line with its mission of empowering free speech.\n\nCase in point: When Joe Biden asked Facebook to no longer accept Trump ads with false claims, the company responded that its approach \"is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\"\n\nGo deeper: Listen to Axios' Dan Primack's recent Pro Rata podcast episode with The Verge's Casey Newton: Mark Zuckerberg vs. Elizabeth Warren", "description": "Facebook\u2019s chief executive and one of the top 2020 Democratic candidates are convenient political targets for one another.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/D767o6fvCeawyWbq8Cpj0F2GjzA=/0x0:1280x720/1920x1080/2019/10/13/1570974737677.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
