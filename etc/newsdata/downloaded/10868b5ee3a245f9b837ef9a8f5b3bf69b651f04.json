Plus, it can be turned into a substantial vegan main simply by omitting the meat. Make this your fall go-to whatever your needs.\n\nDelicata Squash and Italian Sausage Bake\n\nA tomato paste mixture thickens the juices nicely in this recipe, and helps with caramelization. Use Italian style tomato paste from a tube to avoid opening a whole can of tomato paste.\n\n*If you\u2019re using lean sausages, toss the meat with an extra drizzle of olive oil before rolling, as they may dry out in baking.\n\nServe with crusty bread, pasta or polenta.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 delicata squash (about 16 to 20 oz)\n\n1 fennel bulb, sliced\n\n8 garlic cloves, halved\n\n\u00bc cup thinly sliced fresh sage leaves\n\n3 tbsp olive oil, divided\n\nSalt, to taste\n\nPepper, to taste\n\n\u00bd tsp fennel seeds\n\n\u00bd bunch rapini, woody ends trimmed\n\n\u00bc tsp red chili flakes, or to taste\n\n2 tbsp honey\n\n2 tbsp balsamic vinegar\n\n1 tbsp tomato paste\n\n4 Italian turkey or pork sausages*, casing removed (about 1 lb)\n\n\u00bc cup grated Parmesan cheese\n\n2 tbsp thinly sliced fresh basil leaves\n\nred fresh chili, thinly sliced (optional)\n\nPreparation\n\nPreheat the oven to 425F degrees.\n\nCut the squash in half lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds with a spoon. Slice into \u00bc-inch halfmoon slices.\n\nToss together the squash, fennel, garlic, sage, 2 tablespoons of oil, salt, pepper and fennel seeds and arrange them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake until the squash and fennel are tender and start to brown around the edges, about 20 to 25 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, toss the rapini with the remaining oil and season with salt, pepper and chili flakes; set aside. Sir together the honey, balsamic vinegar and tomato paste; set aside.\n\nRoll the sausage meat into twenty meatballs. Add the rapini and meatballs to the baking sheet with the squash and fennel. Drizzle the balsamic mixture over top. Bake for 10 minutes, then stir, and continue to bake until the meatballs are cooked through and the rapini is tender, about 5 to 7 minutes more.\n\nSprinkle the Parmesan cheese, basil and fresh chili peppers over top.\n\nYield: Makes 4 servings", "description": "You could use this recipe for batch cook purposes, or dinner party purposes, just saying.", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5332614.1571862158!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/delicata-squash-and-italian-sausage-bake.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
