He also warned that images from the protests could be used by Russian state media to discredit Ukraine.\n\nProtesters banged snare drums, carried the flags of Ukraine and political parties, and chanted slogans such as \u201cGlory to the nation, no to capitulation!\u201d Some protesters brought bouquets of flowers they planned to lay at military memorials.\n\nThe protests are part of a backlash against Zelenskiy\u2019s policies on the war against Russian-backed separatists in east Ukraine. This month, the president approved a plan that would allow elections in separatist-held Ukraine and then grant special status to the region on the condition the vote was seen as free and fair.\n\nZelenskiy maintains a 70% approval rating but recent polling showed a majority of Ukrainians opposed giving special status to the regions held by separatists. During a 14-hour press conference last week, Zelenskiy said ending the war was the most important mission of his presidency and that he would have to meet with Vladimir Putin to achieve that goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ukrainian servicemen from volunteer units take part in the march.

One veteran on Monday called it a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Yevhen Pylypenko, one of several men wearing fatigues on their way to a protest near a statue of the 19th-century Ukrainian writer Taras Shevchenko, said the plan was a step towards \u201cforgiving the people who fought against us. I think that\u2019s unforgivable.\u201d\n\nThe former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has also opposed the plan, which would amend the stalled Minsk agreement negotiated under his presidency.\n\n\u201cWe will never agree to that,\u201d Poroshenko, now the leader of the European Solidarity party, said last week. \u201cWe feel solidarity with the present actions and calls heard from among veterans and we will not allow the ruin of the Ukrainian state.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy has sought a compromise with nationalist groups, and reportedly met last week with the leaders of veterans\u2019 organisations, as well as prominent far-right leaders.\n\nMany are controversial. On Sunday night, the Ukrainian prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk, spoke at a rally in support of veterans reportedly organised by Andriy Medvedko, a prominent member of the radical nationalist organisation S14. Sokyra Peruna, a white-nationalist metal band whose supporters have made Nazi salutes at their concerts, also played at the bar where the event was held.\n\nHoncharuk on Monday confirmed he spoke at the event to support veterans but said he was not familiar with the band, saying he did not endorse any \u201chate-filled ideology \u2013 neither Nazism, nor fascism, nor communism\u201d.", "description": "Ukrainian president calls on protesters to avoid violence as he is criticised for \u2018capitulation\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/520ffb24c6b80d74fdee91188cbc47277375baea/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78ae850431ccbc801a7e68ca469ed357", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
