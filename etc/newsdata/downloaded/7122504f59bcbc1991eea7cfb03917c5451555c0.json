Bush paintings at the Kennedy Center: A professional exhibition they don\u2019t deserve", "language": "en", "text": "It helped that Bush isn\u2019t a bad artist. He shows a taste for bold colors and heavy impasto, laying on the paint thickly in a way that suggests he has studied the work of Van Gogh and perhaps the Fauvists, too. That he focused his portraits on wounded vets also muted any criticism he was trafficking on his celebrity as an ex-president to boost his new career as an artist. Of course, Bush doesn\u2019t need the money, and he isn\u2019t pretending to be a great artist. In the introduction to \u201cPortraits of Courage,\u201d a catalogue of his portraits, he wrote eloquently and humbly about his concern for the well-being of wounded veterans. Proceeds from the sale of that book are being given to a military and veterans initiative at Bush\u2019s presidential center.\n\nHere, it seemed, was a story to counter the reflexive cynicism of today\u2019s broken political culture.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo it\u2019s unfortunate that the Kennedy Center has now undertaken to display Bush\u2019s work as the first art exhibition mounted in its newly opened expansion space, the Reach. By giving these paintings the endorsement of a professional exhibition, in the nation\u2019s capital, with the imprimatur of a major arts center and by extension the federal government (which supports the center\u2019s budget), the art has been put into a different context, where it does not belong. It also raises important and disturbing questions about the seriousness of the center\u2019s commitment to the visual arts.\n\nThe exhibition has been touring the country, mainly by way of smaller museums in Texas, Missouri and Arizona, and was brought to Washington by Ellery Brown, the senior vice president for operations at the Kennedy Center. Brown doesn\u2019t ordinarily get involved in programming, according to a center spokeswoman.\n\nEvery venue at the Kennedy Center brings with it an inherent prestige. Amateur artists and performers and community-based arts groups appear at the center regularly, as they should. But the exhibition of Bush\u2019s work is different. It will occupy Studio K, one of the largest spaces in the Reach, for six weeks. The rehearsal space has been converted, at considerable effort, to be a home for art, including temporary partitions and lighting, a video and a timed-entry ticket system. Boeing, the second-largest defense contractor in the world, is listed as the underwriter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are dozens of significant artists within a 10-minute drive from the Kennedy Center, and hundreds, if not thousands, nationally, who may never receive this kind of institutional endorsement and generous public display of their work. The moment Bush\u2019s art was put into this setting, the story stopped being primarily about an ex-president\u2019s genial pastime and commitment to veterans, and became an arts story. Now the paintings must be judged relative to the work of other artists, whose art might have been displayed in their stead. And they do not measure up, by any standard.\n\nThe fact that these paintings are images of wounded veterans doesn\u2019t mitigate the poor decision-making at the center. If the center wanted to use art to focus attention on the crisis of post-traumatic stress disorder, homelessness and substance abuse that afflicts too many of our veterans, it should have turned to their art, giving them a voice with an exhibition that explored the expressive and therapeutic role art can play in their lives.\n\nCritics have largely resisted psychoanalyzing the role art may be playing in Bush\u2019s post-presidential life, and whether these paintings are a way of grappling with guilt and remorse for having launched a war that is increasingly viewed as one of the greatest foreign policy blunders in the history of the republic. But with this exhibition, with the funding from Boeing, with its six-week residency at the Kennedy Center, it begins to look less like a charming hobby and more like the grand vanity projects \u2014 bad books of amateur poetry, second career outings in pretend rock bands, abstract paintings on view at galleries that will show anything for a buck \u2014 that celebrities too often foist on the public in later life. And why should critics hold off analyzing that?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe exhibition of art isn\u2019t just about filling wall space with paintings. But that seems to be the thinking at the center, at least in regard to this first exhibition. The Bush paintings were already famous, there are a lot of them, and they celebrate veterans. Who can argue with that? Anyone. If you believe that the center should be using its venues seriously, to challenge audiences, raise new questions and teach them things they might not ordinarily encounter in their everyday lives, then this is an unfortunate show. Some exhibitions fail, and you can still admire those who mounted them for having taken chances and risked something. But mediocre exhibitions that cater only to the fame of the work or the artist are worse: They are a lost opportunity. A real artist who made real work wasn\u2019t given this chance.\n\nThis kind of thing was more common in Washington two decades ago, when the arts were comfortably parochial. People would murmur happily at exhibitions of press photography simply because they had pictures of real presidents in them. The Corcoran mounted a terrible show of sculptures that were based on famous paintings, real Impressionist paintings that people actually recognized, and wasn\u2019t that cool? Bush may be innocent of any part in the decision to bring his work here, but it feels like it got here under the old dispensation: If art has some connection to politics or celebrity, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s good or bad.\n\nSo the story of Bush\u2019s art has gone from \u201che\u2019s not a bad painter\u201d to \u201cwhy is the Kennedy Center endorsing this?\u201d And that raises other questions. Who is in charge of exhibitions at the Reach? Will this $250 million expansion be a significant new venue for visual artists? Or will it default to the cynical and outdated view that Washingtonians will flock to anything arts-related if they have seen it on television?\n\nPortraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief\u2019s Tribute to America\u2019s Warriors.
