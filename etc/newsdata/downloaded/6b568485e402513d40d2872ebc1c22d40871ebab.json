Stony-faced business types, rucksack-touting tourists and yawning schoolchildren jostle for space in the rush-hour crush.\n\nBut among the crowds of commuters is another group waiting to board the train \u2013 a covert patrol of plainclothed officers looking to catch sexual predators in the act.\n\nHarassment should not be seen as part of a \u2018normal\u2019 life for girls and young women. It is not harmless fun Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen\n\nNew research has found that reports of sexual harassment on the London underground have soared by 42% in the last four years. Sadly, it\u2019s a problem on public transport the world over \u2013 from the buses of Hanoi to the New York subway.\n\n\u201cWe know that offenders in every city will target public transport systems as a place to commit offences because of the opportunity it provides,\u201d says Mandy McGregor, head of policing and community safety for Transport for London, which is deploying the undercover officers as part of its Project Guardian scheme.\n\n\u201cCrowded trains allow offenders to evade detection as they can claim it was accidental or a result of the movement of a vehicle. Women may not know who has assaulted them, particularly during rush hour, and may not react because they are trapped or feel embarrassed to say anything. Groping or touching is the most prevalent offence reported, but we\u2019re also seeing relatively new offences such as upskirting and viewing pornography while on public transport.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Los Angeles Metro\u2019s Off Limits campaign offers a 24-hour hotline for reporting sexual harassment staffed by trained counsellors.

Similarly, in 2017 the Los Angeles Metro launched Off-Limits, a 24-hour hotline for reporting sexual harassment staffed by trained counsellors. And the OnDuty app by Metro Vancouver allows passengers to text police and transport officers directly, as well as giving them access to reports on crime hotspots and summaries of crimes around particular stations.\n\n\u201cInternational evidence suggests that the most effective interventions on public transport adopt a combination of different approaches,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cWe need to make it harder for potential offenders to offend, give victims the means and confidence to report, and create a culture where sexual harassment is not tolerated.\u201d\n\nBut clearly in most cities there\u2019s still a long way to go. A 2018 report by the humanitarian NGO Plan International found that sexual harassment is the number-one safety risk facing girls and young women across the world, with Lima considered the most dangerous city of those surveyed for women to use public transport and Stockholm the safest.\n\nIn separate research, Plan also asked women and girls in five cities (Delhi, Kampala, Lima, Madrid and Sydney) to use geolocating to drop a \u201cgood\u201d pin on locations they enjoy, and a \u201cbad\u201d pin on the places they feel unsafe or uncomfortable. Transport hubs, train and bus stations and bus stops were found to be prime locations for groping and harassment.\n\nSimilar crowd-mapping techniques have also been used by south Asia\u2019s SafetiPin, India\u2019s HarassMap, and the international Everyday Sexism project to suggest ideas for changes to key decision-makers in architecture, urban planning and public transport.\n\n\u201cRelentless sexual harassment and abuse is the daily norm for so many young women and girls on our city streets,\u201d says Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, CEO of Plan International. \u201cWe heard the same story in each of the five cities we surveyed: young women are frightened for their physical safety, and angry that this harassment and bullying is not taken seriously.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An employee works in the \u20183117\u2019 emergency call centre against sexual harassment on transport at Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris, France, in March 2018.

If we truly want to achieve gender parity in our urban environments we can make a start by changing the culture of the design and planning industries, by ensuring transport services take gender-sensitive approaches so that they reflect the needs of young women using them, by increasing the gender-parity of decision-making bodies, and by offering gender-sensitive training to key personnel so that they don\u2019t trivialise girls\u2019 concerns.\u201d\n\nIn some cities, young women are taking matters into their own hands. In Hanoi, Vietnam, 10,000 young women travel by bus every month, and 40% of girls say they seldom or never feel safe on public transport in the city.\n\n\u201cOn the bus, mobile phones are being stolen and girls are being harassed,\u201d says My, 17, who uses the bus to travel to school. \u201cA friend was touched and when she objected, she was thrown out of the bus into the street, but the boys were allowed to continue their trip.\u201d\n\nMy is part of Plan International\u2019s youth media project and has created four comic books dealing with the subject of harassment on buses, to be distributed at bus stops and ticket offices. \u201cOur comic booklets advise caution,\u201d she says. \u201cIn emergencies, bus drivers or ticket inspectors must help. They are responsible for security in the bus \u2013 many people do not know that.\u201d\n\nThe organisation Hollaback! was created in 2005 in response to a photo snapped by a woman called Thao Nguyen of a man who masturbated in front of her on the New York subway. The photo went viral and led to the conviction of the perpetrator (\u201craw food guru\u201d Dan Hoyt). \u201cWe started as a blog encouraging all women to \u2018holla back\u2019 at street harassers by taking cellphone pictures and posting them online,\u201d says co-founder Emily May. \u201cWe\u2019re now a global movement in 20 cities in 16 countries.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Women in Casablanca, Morocco, protest against sexual harassment following the sexual assault of a woman on a bus in August 2017. Photograph: AFP Contributor/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA big part of Hollaback!\u2019s work involves bystander intervention training. \u201cOf course the police and the transit system have their role to play, but it\u2019s also about what everyday people can do,\u201d says May. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this big Hollywood moment where you swoop in and destroy the perpetrator and say something witty and save the day.\n\n\u201cIt can be as simple as asking someone \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 or just starting a conversation with the person you think is experiencing an assault. Sometimes this can be enough of a distraction to break the moment and just reassure the person experiencing it that they\u2019re not alone. Small actions can add up to a big change in the culture.\u201d\n\nIn Bangkok, the Theung Wela Pheuk (\u201cTime to Intervene\u201d) initiative is predicated on the belief that bystanders can prevent or deter harassment if they make a timely intervention. Similarly, the Tahadi Association in Casablanca, Morocco, launched a campaign in 2017 to encourage bystanders to intervene, in the wake of an incident where a gang of youths on a bus assaulted a disabled girl, filmed it and uploaded it online. The video went viral, leading to nationwide demonstrations demanding change, and the introduction of a law that punishes sexual harassment (taharrush) with jail time.\n\nIn some countries there are more extreme measures in place to curb harassment. In Mexico City \u2013 where 64% of women say they have been \u201cgroped or physically harassed\u201d on public transport, according to a 2014 Reuters/YouGov poll \u2013 the #NoEsDeHombres (This Is Not What Being a Man Is About) campaign uses stunts to highlight situations commonly experienced by women on public transport. In 2017, commuters on the Mexico City Metro spotted a seat with a protruding plastic penis and male chest, with a sign on the floor saying: \u201cIt is annoying to travel this way, but not compared to the sexual violence women suffer in their daily commutes.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mexico City authorities install \u2018penis seat\u2019 on Metro to combat sexual harassment\n\nMexico City is one of several cities \u2013 also including Tokyo, Delhi and Rio de Janeiro \u2013 that provide women-only carriages on public transport. In India, where sexual abuse on public transport came to worldwide attention in 2012 with the gang-rape and murder of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh on a moving bus, there are Ladies\u2019 Specials \u2013 entire trains reserved for female passengers. Malaysia has bright pink women-only buses and trains. But in many cases female-only cars are not enforced or widely used. In Jakarta, pink and orange female-only carriages were introduced in 2012 but scrapped after seven months because they were largely empty.\n\nMany also feel that women-only carriages are a step backwards rather than a solution, one that puts the onus on women to change their behaviour. As Hollaback!\u2019s May puts it: \u201cWhy do we need a separate carriage? Why can\u2019t men just stop groping us?\u201d Segregation also marginalises individuals from the LGBT community and those who have fluid or nonconforming gender identities.\n\nWhat would a city that is safe for women look like? Read more\n\nAndrea Simon, head of public affairs for End Violence Against Women, says: \u201cWhether it\u2019s London or Lima, it\u2019s not just about prevention, it\u2019s about education. We need wider societal change about how men and women interact, and to teach young people that this behaviour isn\u2019t acceptable. We\u2019re pushing the government to include violence against women and girls in sex and relationship classes in schools.\u201d\n\nMay believes public transport will be the next frontier of the #MeToo movement.\n\n\u201cProtocols are in place to ensure this behaviour doesn\u2019t happen in the workplace,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now people are looking around and saying: \u2018OK, but maybe my commute to work isn\u2019t safe\u2019 or maybe: \u2018My kid\u2019s journey school isn\u2019t safe.\u2019 Now is the time for change.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "As reports of sexual harassment on the London underground soar, studies say the issue is the number-one safety risk facing girls and women worldwide", "authors": ["Kate Wills"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b5743f443d0c433054604040a2da361c114bd36/0_259_5679_3407/master/5679.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db4e3c5eae4096fdf7feb93fc9c24d7a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
