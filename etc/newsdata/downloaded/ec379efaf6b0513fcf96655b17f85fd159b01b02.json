They polled residents to gauge support for the plan.\n\nReleased this week, the survey of 500 Baltimore registered voters found 74% were generally supportive of aerial surveillance over the city \u201cto reduce serious crimes like murder\u201d while 20% were opposed and 6% were unsure.\n\nWashington-based opinion research firm Hart Research Associates conducted the poll, which was paid for by the Baltimore-based Abell Foundation, which reportedly supports the plane proposal, The Sun reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, some local businesses expressed interest in the idea.\n\nRupesh Pandey owns the St. Helena Convenience Store in the city\u2019s Dundalk section. He was not polled but said he could see merit in supporting police investigations.\n\n\u201cWhen crime is getting worse, you have to do something instead of watching it,\u201d Mr. Pandey told The Washington Times.\n\nBut privacy advocates warn that the survey appeared to be weighed in favor of the proposal, which has been pushed by a private donor \u2014 the Ohio-based firm Persistent Surveillance Systems. In 2016, Persistent Surveillance Systems worked secretly with the Baltimore Police Department to fly a surveillance plane over the city. The program eventually was exposed and ended.\n\n\u201cThis aerial surveillance program would be handed over to the city by a private donor without any oversight,\u201d said Jake Laperruque, senior counsel for the Project on Government Oversight\u2019s Constitution Project.\n\n\u201cGovernments cannot act like some sort of a demigod in the sky, which is what they are trying to do here,\u201d Mr. Laperruque told The Times.\n\nHe added that while police \u201care not bad actors,\u201d strict oversight is always required during aerial surveillance to ensure that privacy rights are not infringed upon.\n\nPersistent Surveillance Systems President Ross McNutt has promoted aerial surveillance in Baltimore for at least five years. He has countered that collected footage would be used only to enhance criminal investigations and would supplement evidence collected on ground-level CitiWatch cameras.\n\nLocal media has reported that Mr. McNutt has proposed flying three planes over the city funded by $2.2 million in donations.\n\nIn August, Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison met with Mr. McNutt but reportedly had no interest in reviving the surveillance program.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
