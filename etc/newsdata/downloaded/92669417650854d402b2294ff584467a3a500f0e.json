But already diplomats in Buenos Aires are anxiously awaiting what\u2019s set to be yet another pendulum swing in the country\u2019s foreign policy, this time to the left.\n\nThat may mean a less fulsome embrace of Donald Trump than incumbent Mauricio Macri, under whom Argentina aligned more with U.S. goals in regional affairs, especially regarding Venezuela.\n\nFernandez has signaled that Argentina will return to its alignment with the left-wing governments of Latin America. That could see closer ties with Mexico and Venezuela, and greater tensions with Brazil, the region\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nFernandez doesn\u2019t take office until Dec. 10, but the first signs of change were on show within hours of his election win. In an address to supporters at his campaign headquarters, he congratulated Evo Morales -- the socialist who\u2019s South America\u2019s longest-serving leader -- for securing a fourth term in Bolivia. That\u2019s even as the results are still being verified and as Morales\u2019s opponents allege fraud.\n\nHe also called for the release from jail of Brazil\u2019s former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a hero for the Latin American left who is serving nearly nine years for graft and money laundering. That drew immediate disapproval from current President Jair Bolsonaro, signaling a rift between the two largest members of the regional trade bloc known as Mercosur.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Fernandez Has Outreach Coffee With Defeated Macri\n\nFernandez is also poised to make Mexico the destination of his first international trip, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. There he would meet on Monday with Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, one of the most popular left-wing presidents in the world with an approval rating over 60%.\n\nThe initial actions point to a shift from the U.S.-focused, business-driven foreign policy of Macri toward the more ideological approach favored by the radical left elements in Fernandez\u2019s coalition, who see international relations as an extension of domestic politics.\n\nHis running mate adds to that perception. The incoming vice president is Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who in her time as president favored alliances with leftist leaders and invited tension with western nations.\n\nHere are the main hot spots for Argentine foreign policy under Fernandez:\n\nVenezuela\n\nFernandez\u2019s policy toward Venezuela is important not just for President Nicolas Maduro but for the U.S. as well.\n\nUnder Macri, Argentina was a leader of the Lima Group, an ad-hoc outfit created in 2017 by nations seeking free elections in Venezuela that\u2019s been increasingly critical of Maduro\u2019s regime. During the campaign, Fernandez suggested Argentina could leave the group and align with Mexico and Uruguay, which have taken a less confrontational approach. He\u2019s also demurred on calling Venezuela a dictatorship -- a term Macri has repeatedly used.\n\nAny move to leave the Lima Group would be viewed with concern by Brazil and the U.S., which has taken a strong stance against Maduro. While Fernandez didn\u2019t mention Venezuela in his victory speech, his triumph was celebrated by Maduro as a defeat of neoliberalism.\n\nFernandez replied with an ambiguous message to the Venezuelan leader on the same social media platform, saying \u201ctrue democracy\u201d in Latin America is the way to overcome poverty and inequality in the region.\n\nBrazil\n\nTies with Brazil and its right-wing president will be a key test for South America\u2019s top two economies.\n\nDuring the campaign and even on election night, Fernandez repeatedly called for the release of Lula, whom he visited in prison in July. That has irritated Bolsonaro and those who see his comments as interfering in Brazil\u2019s judicial decisions. Bolsonaro, who has warned that Brazil could leave Mercosur if Argentina pivots to the left, on Monday declined to congratulate Fernandez for his election win -- he said Brazil could potentially join forces with other members of the trade bloc to suspend Argentina.\n\nDiplomats in Brasilia say their hope is Fernandez takes a more pragmatic approach once in office, and that he realizes the value of the trade partnership.\n\nThe U.S.\n\nFor the U.S., Fernandez\u2019s elevation presents a risk after the close alliance between Macri and Trump. The last thing Washington wants is another outspoken Latin American leftist who would reinforce the position of Maduro and the regime in Cuba.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Alberto Fernandez has yet to take office in Argentina.
