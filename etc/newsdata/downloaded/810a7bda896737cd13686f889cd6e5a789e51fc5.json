OnePlus has almost pulled off that same joke with its OnePlus 7T Pro that launched today.\n\nWhen the company launched the OnePlus 7T last month, a lot of people asked, \u201cWhy there\u2019s no pro version?\u201d After this launch, they might ask, \u201cWhy is there is a pro version?\u201d\n\nI can redirect you to our OnePlus 7 Pro article and save myself a lot of work, because honestly, I don\u2019t have much to say. The only thing that has changed is the processor, and it\u2019s a very minor bump from Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 to 855+.\n\nTake a look at specs of the phone, compare it with the 7 Pro\u2019s spec sheet and play \u2018spot the difference.\u2019\n\nSpecifications\n\nScreen: 6.67-inch QHD AMOLED display at 3120 x 1440 resolution\n\nProcessor : Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+\n\n: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ Memory : 8GB\n\n: 8GB Rear camera : 48 \u2013megapixel sensor with f/1.6 aperture + 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle sensor with f/2.2 aperture(field of view: 117-degrees) + 8-megapixel telephoto sensor with f/2.4 aperture\n\n: 48 + 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle sensor with f/2.2 The camera zoom: 3x optical zoom\n\n3x optical zoom Front camera : 16-megapixel with f/2.0\n\n: 16-megapixel with f/2.0 Battery : 4,085mAh\n\n: 4,085mAh Charging: Warp charging at 30W (same as the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition, which juiced up the phone\u2019s 3,700mAh battery in one hour)\n\nWarp charging at 30W (same as the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition, which juiced up the phone\u2019s 3,700mAh battery in one hour) Software : Android 10 with OxygenOS\n\n: Android 10 with OxygenOS Internal storage: 256GB UFS 3.0 (that means data read/write operations are twice as fast as the previous generation of storage)\n\n256GB UFS 3.0 (that means data read/write operations are twice as fast as the previous generation of storage) Biometric security: Under the display fingerprint sensor, face unlock\n\nThe company has changed the color of the phone slightly to a darker shade of blue and changed the position of the depth sensor to the left of the camera module. Then there\u2019s the McLaren Edition, which basically bumps up the RAM to 12 GB and gives you a black design with orange highlights.\n\nIn India, the OnePlus 7T Pro will cost Rs 53,999 and the McLaren Edition will cost Rs 58,999; both devices will be available October 11. In the UK, the OnePlus 7T Pro will cost \u00a3699 and go on sale October 17, while the McLaren Edition will cost \u00a3799 and be available November 5.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F7T-Pro.jpg&signature=a8c8456a0665743a3c1ec58b6d289d3f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
