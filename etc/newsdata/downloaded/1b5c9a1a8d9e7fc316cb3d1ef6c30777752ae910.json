(Photo: Photo Courtesy NYC Ferry)\n\nOne of the women in the group was told by an NYC Ferry employee that \"security\" informed him not to let her and her group on to the ferry. The document says the families were escorted to security in full view of the other passengers.\n\nThe complaint states a security officer who spoke with one of the women in the group was \"confused\" and did not know why the NYC Ferry employees were \"blaming security.\"\n\nEventually, the complaint says, another NYC Ferry employee got involved who \"was rude, unprofessional, and raised her voice towards Complainants who were only trying to learn why they were being denied service.\"\n\nThe employee allegedly said the families were denied access because the children in their group were \"allegedly standing on the seats\" during an earlier ferry ride.\n\nAir Canada: Made a 12-year-old remove her hijab.

After two hours, the three families were able to board a ferry back to Bay Ridge.\n\nThat evening, one of the women in the group submitted a complaint to NYC Ferry about the incident. According to the complaint, NYC Ferry conceded the worker's allegation the children were standing on seats was not true.\n\nNYC Ferry called the incident a \"misunderstanding\" and offered a refund, according to the complaint, which said the families were \"embarrassed and humiliated\" during the incident. It calls the day \"one of the worst days\" of the lives of the families involved.\n\nCrew 'didn't feel comfortable': 2 Muslim men say American Airlines canceled flight\n\nIn a Wednesday tweet, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said discrimination \"is an insult to ALL New Yorkers.\"\n\n\"Bigotry has no place in this city,\" he tweeted. \"We will confront it and hold those involved accountable.\"\n\nThe New York City Economic Development Corporation, which operates NYC Ferry, said in a statement to USA TODAY that \"discrimination has no place in our city.\"\n\n\"The City is investigating these allegations, and if they are proven true, will take swift and appropriate action to hold those responsible accountable,\" an EDC spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe families involved in the complaint are seeking punitive damages, as well as compensatory damages for \"humiliation, embarrassment, and severe emotional distress.\"\n\nThey're also seeking an apology and \"appropriate discipline and significant sensitivity and cultural trainings to deter future reprehensible conduct.\"\n\n\"All New Yorkers, regardless of creed, deserve equal and fair service free of discrimination, especially when using public transportation like the NYC Ferry,\" CAIR-NY Litigation Director Ahmed Mohamed said in a statement.\n\n\"These families were humiliated and traumatized in public view and treated as suspect because they happen to be Muslim. That is unacceptable. We hope the City will live up to its commitment of nondiscrimination and swiftly correct this injustice.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2019/10/17/complaint-nyc-ferry-employees-stopped-3-muslim-families-boarding/4013802002/", "description": "According to a complaint filed by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, three Muslim families were stopped from boarding an NYC Ferry.", "authors": ["Jordan Culver", "Published P.M.
