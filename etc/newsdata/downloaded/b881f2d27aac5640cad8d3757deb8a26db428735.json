However, after peaking in May at 144,255, the monthly totals have dropped. In September, 52,000 people were apprehended or rejected at the border, a low for the year.\n\nMore:\n\nSome have pointed to that recent drop as an indication that President Donald Trump's strict immigration policies, which have attempted to deter migrants and asylum seekers, are beginning to take effect. Others have suggested the decline is part of a seasonal drop, as migration at the border tends to taper off during the hot summer months.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nNearly half all those detained in September were children or families, many of them led by human-trafficking cartels, said Robert Perez, deputy commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection.\n\n\"They are profiting on the backs of this vulnerable population, and that's why it's still a crisis,\" Perez said at a news conference at the border in El Paso on Tuesday.\n\nActing Commissioner Mark Morgan said there had been \"dramatic strides\" thanks to Trump policy changes and Mexican cooperation, but that far too many people were crossing the border.\n\n\"It's 1,400 apprehensions a day. That's still at crisis levels,\" Morgan said.\n\nControversial policies\n\nTrump has made immigration a centrepiece presidency and re-election campaign.\n\nCritics have accused the president of implementing inhumane practices that they say have included denying asylum to those with legitimate claims, cruelly detaining migrants in substandard conditions and separating children from parents.\n\nIn the spring of 2018, the Trump administration enacted a \"zero tolerance\" policy on immigration. As part of the policy, children were regularly separated from their parents, who were detained.\n\nFollowing widespread condemnation and outrage over the practice, Trump signed an executive order ending family separation in July of last year. Rights groups say the many families remain separated, however.\n\nThe Trump administration has more recently sought to curtail the number of asylum seekers, mostly from the impoverished and violent Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nAbout 15 percent of Central Americans who have made asylum claims in recent years have been granted some type of relief or protection from US immigration judges, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn July, the Trump administration created a rule that prevented anyone from claiming asylum in the US if they travelled through another country in which they could have claimed asylum. Since then, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have signed agreements that could lead to them absorbing asylum applicants from the US border. The details of those agreements are unclear.\n\nTrump has also enacted the so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which requires migrants and asylum seekers attempting to enter the US through the southern border to wait in Mexico until their case is heard in court.\n\nLast week, the Justice Department announced plans to collect migrant DNA at the border, a move derided by rights groups.", "description": "Apprehension numbers have dropped recently, however, falling to 52,000 in September, the lowest monthly total for 2019.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/8/16/8152f5f4bef143caab6d05df9c9a0b25_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
