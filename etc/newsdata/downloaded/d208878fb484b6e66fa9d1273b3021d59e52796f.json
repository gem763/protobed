Their manager was full of praise. \u201cWe can count on some extraordinary players,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe took the match seriously as always and, thanks to the young guys, we are through to the next round. The back four know each other from the academy and they combined perfectly.\u201d\n\nTottenham crash out of Carabao Cup to Colchester on penalties Read more\n\nIf Harwood-Bellis looked mature beyond his years in defence, Raheem Sterling was the star of the attacking show, his goal in particular a classy run straight at the heart of the Preston defence with a couple of neat feints as he entered the area to buy himself more space.\n\nJosh Harrop could not quite reach an inviting Ryan Ledson cross with the first chance of the game in the opening minute and the same player struck an upright in the second half. But by that stage City had scored all their goals and were cruising. Sterling and David Silva helped set up Gabriel Jesus for the second, then Preston\u2019s goalkeeper, Connor Ripley, was beaten by a deflection off his own defender as Ledson\u2019s touch sent David Silva\u2019s relatively innocuous cross into the net.\n\nPhil Foden hit the bar in the second half, again after an enterprising run from Sterling, and when the England player was withdrawn shortly before the end he was applauded from all sides of the ground. Sterling had brought a good save from Ripley in the first half, just before Jesus headed narrowly over from a David Silva cross to the far post.\n\nPreston had made several changes too and their manager, Alex Neil, thought his players performed well but perhaps paid the penalty for being a little too adventurous against top-class opponents. \u201cWe did all right, we didn\u2019t disappoint, if anything we got a bit too hungry going forward and left gaps for City to exploit,\u201d Neil said. \u201cThey scored some quality goals.\u201d\n\nGuardiola defended Bernardo Silva when asked about his reaction to the news that the FA may discipline him over his allegedly racist tweet to his teammate Benjamin Mendy. \u201cIf they are going to do that, I think they need to know what sort of a person Bernardo is,\u201d the City manager said.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what will happen but Bernardo is one of the loveliest people I have ever met in my life, he speaks four or five languages and Mendy is one of his best friends. They are like brothers and the response from Mendy was clear; it was a joke all the time. I\u2019ve seen many similar situations with white people and in any case the image is not about the colour of skin.\n\n\u201cBernardo is an exceptional person, completely open-minded about nationalities and skin colour. I think the authorities should put their focus on another issue because they don\u2019t know which guy they are talking about.\u201d", "description": "Manchester City breezed into the fourth round of the Carabao Cup with a comfortable 3-0 win over Preston North End at Deepdale", "authors": ["Paul Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ec54d790a34a09a726cfe04f9901ea22809eefc/0_104_3366_2020/master/3366.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4957682e22f7d36a96345eb6fb8f6746", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
