Billionaire wealth has risen by an average of 13 per cent a year since 2010 -- six times faster than the wages of ordinary workers, which have risen by a yearly average of just 2 per cent,\" it said.\n\nIn India, it will take 941 years for a minimum wage worker in rural India to earn what the top paid executive at a leading Indian garment firm earns in a year, the study found.\n\nAFP/Representational Image\n\nIn the US, it takes slightly over one working day for a CEO to earn what an ordinary worker makes in a year, it added.\n\nCiting results of the global survey of 70,000 people surveyed in 10 countries, Oxfam said it demonstrates a groundswell of support for action on inequality and nearly two-thirds of all respondents think the gap between the rich and the poor needs to be urgently addressed.\n\nHow to tackle growing income inequality\n\nWith Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the WEF meeting in Davos, Oxfam India urged the Indian government to ensure that the country's economy works for everyone and not just the fortunate few.\n\nIt asked the government to promote inclusive growth by encouraging labour-intensive sectors that will create more jobs; investing in agriculture; and effectively implementing the social protection schemes that exist.\n\nOxfam also sought sealing of the \"leaking wealth bucket\" by taking stringent measures against tax evasion and avoidance, imposing higher tax on super-rich and removing corporate tax breaks.\n\nThe survey respondents in countries like the US, UK and India also favoured 60 per cent pay cut for CEOs.\n\nBCCL/Representational Image\n\nThe key factors driving up rewards for shareholders and corporate bosses at the expense of workers' pay and conditions, Oxfam said, include erosion of workers' rights; excessive influence of big business over government policy- making; and the relentless corporate drive to minimise costs in order to maximise returns to shareholders.\n\nMore billionaires doesn't mean booming economy\n\nAbout India, it said the country added 17 new billionaires last year, taking the total number to 101. The Indian billionaires' wealth increased to over Rs 20.7 lakh crore \u2014 increasing during last year by Rs 4.89 lakh crore, an amount sufficient to finance 85 per cent of the all states' budget on health and education.\n\nIt also said India's top 10 per cent of population holds 73 per cent of the wealth and 37 per cent of India's billionaires have inherited family wealth. They control 51 per cent of the total wealth of billionaires in the country.\n\nOxfam India CEO Nisha Agrawal said it is alarming that the benefits of economic growth in India continue to concentrate in fewer hands.\n\n\"The billionaire boom is not a sign of a thriving economy but a symptom of a failing economic system. Those working hard, growing food for the country, building infrastructure, working in factories are struggling to fund their child's education, buy medicines for family members and manage two meals a day. The growing divide undermines democracy and promotes corruption and cronyism,\" she said.\n\nBCCL/Representational Image\n\nThe survey also showed that women workers often find themselves at the bottom of the heap and nine out of 10 billionaires are men.\n\nIn India, there are only four women billionaires and three of them inherited family wealth.\n\n\"It would take around 17.5 days for the best paid executive at a top Indian garment company to earn what a minimum wage worker in rural India will earn in their lifetime (presuming 50 years at work),\" Oxfam said.\n\nWith Inputs From PTI", "description": "The situation appears even more grim globally, where 82% of the wealth generated last year worldwide went to the 1%, while 3.7 billion people that account for the poorest half of population saw no increase in their wealth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2018/Jan/indias_richest_1_hold_73_of_wealth_generated_worsening_income_inequality_crisis_in_country_1516601500_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-22"}
