Raja Krishnamoorthi announced new legislation Monday that would put a cap the concentration of nicotine in e-cigarette products.\n\nThe newly introduced bill would restrict nicotine content to no more than 20 milligrams per milliliter \"to make them significantly less addictive and appealing to youth,\" according to an announcement Monday by Krishnamoorthi's office.\n\nThe move mirrors regulations in places like the European Union, which imposes the same cap of 20 milligrams per milliliter. In the United States, where no national cap exists, some brands contain several times that -- including 59 mg/ml in a 5% Juul pod. Juul has maintained that a 5% pod is designed to replace one pack of cigarettes in terms of the number of puffs and the nicotine strength. CNN has reached out to Juul for comment.\n\nUnder the legislation, the US Food and Drug Administration would also be able to lower the cap further if necessary.\n\nExperts say that high nicotine concentrations have played a role in what they describe as an epidemic of vaping among youth. In September, the FDA revealed that 27.5% of high school students were current users of e-cigarettes in 2019 -- up from 20.8% in 2018 and 11.7% in 2017.\n\nRead More", "description": "US Rep.
