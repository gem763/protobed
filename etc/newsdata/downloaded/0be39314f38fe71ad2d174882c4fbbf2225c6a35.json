Both NBC and Farrow found me credible.\u201d\n\nAs she had admitted in her book, she reiterated that she \u201ccontinued to engage with him, as many victims of acquaintance rape do, particularly in the workplace.\u201d\n\nMatt Lauer has broken his silence in an open letter. His accuser responded, calling the letter \u201ca case study in victim shaming.\u201d @StephGosk has the details. pic.twitter.com/zFPAFDyB8X \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 10, 2019\n\nNevils\u2019s statement went on to say, \u201cI am not afraid of him now, regardless of his threats, bullying, and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would (and now has) tried to use against me.\u201d\n\nAs well as, \"The shame in this story belongs to him.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Nevils used Twitter to thank the women and men who reached out to her in the wake of her telling her story.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support,\u201d Nevils wrote on social media. \u201cIt takes courage, and I am truly grateful.\u201d\n\nNevils told Ronan Farrow, for his upcoming book Catch and Kill, that Lauer raped her in his hotel room at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Variety reported the story on Wednesday, citing excerpts from the yet-to-be published book. Though Nevils has not been named until now, her allegation, which she brought to NBC human resources in November 2017, is notably the one that led to Lauer being fired the next day.\n\nI want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support. It takes courage, and I am truly grateful. \u2014 Brooke Nevils (@BrookeNevils) October 9, 2019\n\nLauer has denied the accusation against him. He said that he did have a sexual relationship with Nevils, but he insisted that it was consensual. \u201cIn a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\u201d\n\nNBC News issued its own statement: \u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d Nevils also received support from former Today co-host Ann Curry.\n\nBrooke Nevils is a credible young woman of good character. She came to NBC News an eager and guileless 20-something, brimming with talent.\n\n\n\nI believe she is telling the truth. And that breaks my heart. https://t.co/k4LT3MEh5Q \u2014 Ann Curry (@AnnCurry) October 9, 2019\n\nAfter Nevils thanked her supporters, many of them thanked her right back.\n\nThank you for speaking out! For those of us raising daughters in this complicated world, your strong, courageous voice sets an example to these young women! I\u2019ll pray for you, for strength during this difficult time. You are not alone! \u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Purple Dalmation (@purpledalmation) October 10, 2019\n\nI believe you. Thank you for your bravery. \u2014 Jill Krause (@babyrabies) October 10, 2019\n\nYou are a survivor AND an extraordinary woman ! Never let anyone get you down ... Easier said than done, but getting up and making a choice to think about the wonderful people in your life is vital! Thank you for your bravery !
