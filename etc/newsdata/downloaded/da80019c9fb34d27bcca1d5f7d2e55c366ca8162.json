Christ and His cross is what still stands for us,\u201d said Northway Church\u2019s lead pastor, Shea Sumlin, who posted the now-viral photo online.\n\n\u201cHere an F-3 tornado ripped off our roof\u2026yet here\u2019s this wooden cross, that I have no idea how it didn\u2019t get picked up,\u201d the pastor told Fox News.\n\n\u201cEven though our building is broken, our body is as whole and alive as we\u2019ve ever been because of the hope of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service said that at least three tornadoes touched down in North Texas on Sunday evening, destroying homes and cutting power for over 140,000 residents.\n\n\u201cMonday afternoon, NWS survey teams confirmed three twisters: an EF-3 tornado with maximum winds of 140 mph in North Dallas, an EF-1 tornado with maximum winds of 100 mph that touched down in Rowlett and an EF-0 that touched down in Wills Point in Van Zandt County,\u201d according to NBC 5.\n\nOn Sunday night, viewers sent video footage to the news outlet which showed the tornadoes moving across the area:\n\nViewer video from Rockwall.\n\nWatch live coverage: https://t.co/ByzQWZd6UI\n\n(Video contains profanity.

Then we\u2019ll go right back to work in the morning helping with the physical needs that around us, so that kind of brings us together again tonight,\u201d Sumlin commented.\n\nResident Gabriel Flores said that although the church building is severely damaged, that does not mean its members are.\n\n\u201cSince Sunday night, I\u2019ve been seeing the structure just broken and what I call the church building being broken down. But what we call the church, which is the people, coming together and having some brisket is amazing,\u201d Flores concluded.", "description": "A cross remained standing inside a church in Dallas, Texas, after an F-3 tornado tore the building apart on Sunday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/cross-is-saved-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
