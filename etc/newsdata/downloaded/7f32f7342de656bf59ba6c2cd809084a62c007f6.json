The contest is watched from behind a barrier by a group of spectators, including the Prince of Wales, wearing the Star of the Garter, and some women and children\n\nThe description continues: 'Medical examination after his death revealed him to be a man.\n\nA post-mortem examination following the death of d'\u00c9on in 1810 revealed the aristocrat had male organs 'in every respect perfectly formed' but with 'breast remarkably full'\n\n'Even during her female times Eon remained a keen fencer; this encounter took place at Carlton House on 9 April 1787 in the presence of the Prince of Wales, sundry gentlemen and fencing aficionados.\n\n'Here we see the Chevalier de Saint-George getting slightly the worse of the encounter, with the Chevalier d'\u00c9on, dressed in female clothes to the right.\n\n'The contest is watched from behind a barrier by a group of spectators, including the Prince of Wales, wearing the Star of the Garter, and some women and children.'\n\nNow the artwork is to go on display for the first time in a Buckingham Palace exhibition, the Times reports.\n\nA post-mortem examination following the death of d'\u00c9on, whom many believe was intersex, in 1810 revealed the aristocrat had male organs 'in every respect perfectly formed' but with 'breast remarkably full'.\n\nD'\u00c9on won the match depicted by the painting, owned by George IV - aged 24 at the time, depicted in the artwork as a young, slim man.\n\nCharles d'Eon de Beaumont (1728-1810), pictured left and right in men's and women's clothing\n\nThe piece's painter, Robineau, was also a composer and violinist who spent a lot of time in London in the 1780s where he met the Prince of Wales in both his professional capacities.\n\nWHO WAS THE CHEVALIER D'EON? Born in October 1728 as Charles d'\u00c9on de Beaumont, the Chevalier d'\u00c9on was a French diplomat, spy, and soldier who fought in the Seven Years War. D\u2019Eon first arrived in London as part of the French embassy in 1762, helping to negotiate the Peace of Paris, ending the Seven Years War. Despite being awarded the Croix de St Louis, d\u2019Eon did not return to France when recalled, instead publishing secret correspondence which revealed French ministerial corruption. The chevalier then blackmailed Louis XVI by threatening to reveal secret information about French invasion plans. The French king offered d'Eon an official pension in 1775 to keep quiet - with the condition that d\u2019Eon should dress as a woman from then on. D'eon returned to Britain in 1785 and forged a new career carrying out fencing demonstrations.\n\nChevalier d'\u00c9on was once French ambassador to Russia, a member of Louis XV's secret service and a spy for the French monarch in London.\n\nIt was also rumoured he had assumed the role of a woman to carry out espionage in Russia - but factionary disputes at within the French court meant he later lived as an exile in London.\n\nExhibit curator Kate Heard said: 'In London she lives entirely as a woman, and fences as a woman. Her landlady looks after her for 14 years believing she has a female lodger.\n\n'D'\u00c9on was greatly admired by London society. She knows all the greatest people.'\n\nThe future George IV is visible wearing a large hat amid his 'glittering court' in the painting - a piece he certainly commissioned, said Dr Heard.\n\nIt is not known whether George was aware of d'\u00c9on's original gender.\n\nGeorge IV: Art & Spectacle opens at Buckingham Palace's Queen's Gallery on November 15.", "description": "The painting, which shows Chevalier d'Eon fencing in front of the future George IV, is to go on display at Buckingham Palace.
