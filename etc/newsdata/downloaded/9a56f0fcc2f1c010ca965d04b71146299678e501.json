He is outside on his own, physical work to deal with a few issues. We need to get him right now because he has been in and out through the whole season as we know.\n\nThe Chelsea boss refused to put a timescale on the length of the World Cup winner's absence\n\n\u2018I just want him fit so I think that he has played a lot of football for four years. He has had a big injury off the back of last season.\n\n\u2018So I think that maybe we, I, he is suffering from that big injury and a little fall out from that.\n\n\u2018I think now it is time to take a small step back just to get his fitness up and be confident that we won\u2019t have a domino effect with small injuries so there\u2019s no actual time frame.\u2019", "description": "Chelsea star Kante (pictured) is nursing a groin problem that he picked up with France during the international break.
