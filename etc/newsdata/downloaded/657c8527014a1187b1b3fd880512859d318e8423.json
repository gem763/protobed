Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d\n\nHe said it was his job as a priest to minister the souls in his care, and that responsibility is still there when in difficult situations.\n\n\u201cI will keep Mr Biden in my prayers,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Biden has had a somewhat convoluted approach to abortion, as a leading figure in a Democratic Party that largely supports a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nHe has said that he supports codifying into statute the landmark US Supreme Court case Roe v Wade, which established a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion without undue government restrictions.\n\nBut he also said during a 2012 vice presidential debate that he is personally opposed to abortion, even if he is unwilling to impose that belief on others.\n\nHe has flip-flopped on his position on the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funding for abortion except incases of rape, incest, or in pregnancies where the woman\u2019s life is put in danger. In June, his campaign signalled that he supported that amendment, which put him at odds with much of the Democratic Party.\n\nHe said days later at a gala that he does not support that amendment.\n\nThe Catholic church contends that human life must be respected and protected from the moment of conception.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Joe Biden has been denied Holy Communion at a South Carolina church, as a result of his pro-choice stance on the Democratic campaign trail.Mr Biden was attending mass at a church in Florence, South Carolina, when father Robert E Morey denied the lifelong Catholic one of the seven sacraments of the Roman", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V4u98LUCpvfJ_28h5sJzZQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/b226adcfa8bef30aa8e5272ca0e9b792", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
