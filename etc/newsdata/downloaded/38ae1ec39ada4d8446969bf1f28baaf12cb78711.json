Yet the positions are so entrenched on both sides that these gatherings have started to develop a zombie feel, rather like those demented lonely bellowers who stand there morning, noon and night howling inanely at the Westminster television platforms.\n\nAerial view of the anti-Brexit protest in Parliament Square, London, on Saturday, after it was announced that the Letwin amendment had been accepted\n\nEven as the cliff-edge result of the \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 vote was announced \u2014 a thumping great victory for those of a Remainerish bent \u2014 the response was weary delight rather than euphoria. They were clapping and cheering, of course. But I didn\u2019t see any cartwheels. There was much more cork-popping mayhem right across the country earlier in the day as England stormed through to the semi-finals of the Rugby World Cup.\n\nYou only needed to look at the banners as the marchers weaved their way through the capital. The jokes and slogans were as tired as the Westminster street cleaners who, having just finished mopping up after a fortnight\u2019s lie-in by the Extinction Rebellion brigade, must now dispose of thousands of discarded Remain banners.\n\nOne of the most prominent was a giant replica of a Camembert with the slogan \u2018Fromage \u2014 Not Farage\u2019. That was funny in those shell-shocked days after the 2016 referendum. Come autumn 2019, it was not merely past its sell-by date but starting to pong.\n\nCarnival float depicting the PM\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings with a giant hand up the rear of a puppet-sized Boris Johnson, the work of Dusseldorf-based artist, Jacques Tilly. Mr Tilly had slapped the words \u2018Demonic Cummings\u2019 on his monster and given him a Nazi-style uniform\n\nThere were umpteen posters, too, on a tired \u2018Eton Mess\u2019 theme and a lot of earnest messages like: \u2018Fixing Britain\u2019s Broken Politics.\u2019\n\nBest-in-show was a carnival float depicting the PM\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings with a giant hand up the rear of a puppet-sized Boris Johnson. It was the work of Dusseldorf-based artist, Jacques Tilly. Mr Tilly had slapped the words \u2018Demonic Cummings\u2019 on his monster and given him a Nazi-style uniform for good measure. Perhaps he didn\u2019t get the memo that it is only the nasty Tories and Brexiteers who do cheap abuse.\n\nAt least Mr Tilly had made some effort. Many protesters gave up on any attempt at wit or wisdom and simply scrawled the F-word next to a photo of Boris Johnson.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson speaking during a Brexit debate inside the House of Commons on Saturday\n\nThe vast majority, it must be said, were friendly and polite, even when two dozen kamikaze Brexit Party ultras attempted a counter-march against the flow.\n\nThe most striking thing of all, however, was the make-up of this crowd. \u2018People\u2019s Vote! People\u2019s Vote!\u2019 chanted an overwhelmingly white, middle-to-late-middle-aged, middle-class chorus who, it must be said, could no more claim to be a cross-section of the British people than a Surrey golf club hog roast. There must have been tumbleweed blowing through many a Home Counties Waitrose on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe organisers had made much of the fact that this was a national march involving buses from all corners of the kingdom.\n\nMost, however, had not come far. When Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah bounced on to the Parliament Square stage, shouting \u2018Ok! Who is here from the North East?\u2019, there came forth an uncomfortable silence.\n\nBack in March, the Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow got into trouble while covering the last big pro-Brexit march. He told viewers: \u2018I have never seen so many white people in one place\u2019 (Channel 4 later apologised).\n\nWell, I also covered that event and I can honestly say I saw no more minority faces on this occasion. And this was a bigger event, too.\n\nI am not being glib. Just to be on the safe side, given the toxicity of this debate, I took a series of 360-degree photos around me in Parliament Square and filmed the crowd shots on the jumbo screen. I went back through them all afterwards. What was even more apparent than the complexion of this crowd was the average age. It is received wisdom that the Brexit vote was all down to grumpy old white folks, whereas Remain is the preserve of the young, angrily mourning their \u2018stolen youth\u2019 (we heard a lot about \u2018stolen youth\u2019 all weekend).\n\nA pro-Brexit supporter argues with pro-Remainer outside the House of Commons on Saturday\n\nThere were plenty of students and children in the mix, of course, with several served up for the benefit of the TV cameras. But they were easily outnumbered by grey heads old enough to remember the days when Britain actually voted to stay in the Common Market.\n\nI encountered a particularly high quota of retired teachers \u2014 and would wager that one of their ilk (probably from the geography department) was behind the thigh-slapping banner which stated: \u2018Enough of Woolly promises and Mammoth Lies.\u2019\n\nAt 86, Lord Heseltine was by no means out of place as he produced one of the more eloquent speeches (there were some utter clunkers).\n\nBrexit, he warned, was a \u2018creeping paralysis\u2019 while \u2018the very existence of our United Kingdom now hangs by a thread\u2019.\n\nHe received some of the loudest cheers of the day.\n\nThere were also rock star welcomes for Tory arch-rebel Dominic Grieve, Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn and a quartet of Lib Dems led by party leader Jo Swinson. \u2018They look like a wee band!\u2019 chirped the compere. There was certainly a touch of the Eurovisions about culture spokeswoman Layla Moran\u2019s orange mac.\n\nIt was, by now, tipping it down. The celeb contingent on stage consisted of Star Trek\u2019s Sir Patrick Stewart and Bake Off\u2019s Sandi Toksvig \u2014 who likened Boris Johnson to a dodgy used car salesman \u2014 while Sir Bob Geldof and John le Carre mingled in the crowd. Ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell \u2014 billed rather flatteringly as someone \u2018who brought peace\u2019 to Northern Ireland \u2014 introduced a video message from two former PMs, Sir John Major and Tony Blair.\n\nThe former warned of the impending break-up of the UK. The latter was adamant that the British will flock back to the EU fold come another referendum.\n\nFor all their sincere determination to quash one \u2018People\u2019s Vote\u2019 with another, at no point in the entire afternoon did I hear anyone among the hundreds of thousands on parade address the obvious but awkward question: \u2018What if the EU don\u2019t want us back?\u2019", "description": "ROBERT HARDMAN: Even among these well-shod, well-organised Remainer diehards, there was no concealing the signs of protest fatigue this weekend.", "authors": ["Robert Hardman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19965406-0-image-a-55_1571613272676.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
