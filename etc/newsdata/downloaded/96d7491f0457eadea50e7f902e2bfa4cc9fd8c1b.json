The prime minister tweeted on Thursday: \u201cDomestic abuse shatters lives and tears families apart. We are fully committed to tackling this horrific crime \u2013 which is why the Queen\u2019s speech will confirm we will be reintroducing domestic abuse legislation in the next session.\u201d\n\nSir James Munby, the former president of the family division of the high court of England and Wales, has called for the domestic abuse bill to be brought back before parliament.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Thursday: \u201cThis is a vitally important bill, tackling what everyone agrees is a very great social evil. It is immensely depressing nothing effective has been done to get this necessary reform through parliament.\u201d\n\nMunby added: \u201cThe bill must be reintroduced in parliament as soon as the next session starts. It must then be pursued to the earliest possible conclusion of the parliamentary process with determination, vigour and a real sense of urgent commitment on the part of government.\n\n\u201cWhat the prime minister does or not will be a vital litmus test of his real commitment to safeguarding those in our society who are vulnerable, disadvantaged and oppressed.\u201d\n\nThe domestic abuse bill was introduced in parliament in July. The proposals would give better protection to those fleeing violence by placing a new legal duty on councils to provide secure homes for them and their children.\n\nIt would also introduce the first legal government definition of domestic abuse, which would include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour.\n\nA row erupted earlier this month over the former prime minister Theresa May\u2019s decision to honour her favourite cricketer, Geoffrey Boycott, who was was convicted in France in 1998 of beating up his then girlfriend in a Riviera hotel.\n\nWhile campaigners said it was sending a \u201cdangerous message\u201d that \u201cdomestic abuse is not taken seriously as a crime\u201d, Boycott said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t give a toss\u201d about criticism of his knighthood.", "description": "Figures show 173 people died in domestic violence-related homicides in Britain last year", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bafd94a6c39090fe3ff6a693c09267f0e3aee146/0_219_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=92267ec46058b5ce97a7b24ac0eb06d2", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
