Officials acknowledged that a range of factors could undermine that forecast, including continued disputes over international trade policy and increased geopolitical risks.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the need to resolve trade tensions and support the necessary reform of the World Trade Organization,\u201d the statement said. It did not detail ways to accomplish that.\n\nThere was also no sign that discussions on the sidelines of the meetings had produced any breakthrough in the trade disputes initiated by President Donald Trump as part of his get-tough approach to stronger enforcement of U.S. trade laws to lower America\u2019s huge trade deficits.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in remarks to the IMF committee, said the administration\u2019s goal was to prepare \u201ca foundation for future growth through fairer trade deals.\u201d\n\nMnuchin said negotiations last week between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two biggest economies, had achieved \u201csubstantial progress\u201d on phase one of a trade deal to resolve the U.S. claims that China is stealing intellectual property.\n\nWhile Trump suspended a tariff increase on $250 billion of Chinese products that had been scheduled to take effect this past week, few specifics about that agreement have been published. U.S. officials said negotiations to wrap up those details are underway.\n\nThe IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said the threat from trade wars was a chief point of discussion for finance officials.\n\nShe said the IMF has estimated that the tariffs already imposed or threatened could shave 0.8% off global economic growth by the end of next year. Much of that stems from the fallout on business confidence.\n\nIn trade wars, \u201ceverybody loses,\u201d she said. \u201cPolicymakers ought to take very seriously their obligations to international cooperation in trade.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s president, David Malpass, said this week\u2019s finance discussions had focused on how to address multiple challenges.\n\n\u201cGrowth is slowing, investment is sluggish, manufacturing activity is soft and trade is weakening,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change and fragility are making poor countries more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nHe said the World Bank was committed to helping to address these challenges to provide a better life for the 700 million people in the world living in extreme poverty.\n\nThe IMF, in an updated economic outlook, projected the global economy would expand by 3% this year, the weakest in a decade, and said 90 percent of the world was experiencing a downshift in growth. But the IMF forecast growth will accelerate slightly to 3.4% in 2020, still below the 3.6% rate in 2018.\n\nJubilee USA, a religious organization fighting global poverty, said in a statement that while the IMF outlined a number of serious threats, the recommendations for dealing with them fell short.\n\n\u201cRisky investing, trade tensions and developing countries borrowing too much are serious concerns for financial stability,\u201d said Eric LeCompte, the group\u2019s executive director.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s trade policies were a prime topic of discussion at the meetings, finance officials for the most part avoided direct criticism of the American president.\n\nChristine Lagarde, who dealt with the Trump administration during her last three years as head of the IMF, was a bit more direct in an interview to be broadcast Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s trade war with China, she said it would give the world\u2019s economy \u201ca big haircut\u201d and should be resolved by having all parties \u201csit down like big men, many men in those rooms and put everything on the table, and try to deal bit by bit, piece by piece, so that we have certainty.\u201d\n\nOn Trump\u2019s frequent Twitter attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Lagarde said central bankers need to be independent to do their jobs well.\n\n\u201cMarket stability should not be the subject of a tweet here or a tweet there. It requires consideration, thinking, quiet and measured and rational decisions,\u201d she said.\n\nLagarde is scheduled to take over on Nov. 1 as the head of the European Central Bank, which manages monetary policy for the 19 countries who use the euro currency.", "description": "Global finance ministers and central bank officials wrapped up their fall meetings on Saturday with a pledge to \u201cemploy all appropriate tools\u201d to combat the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT656_imf_wo_ZG_20191019190336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
