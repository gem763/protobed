Syria, ceasefire will last for 120 hours", "language": "en", "text": "Turkey has agreed to temporarily halt its military operation against Syria\u2019s Kurdish-led militias, allowing them to withdraw from the country\u2019s border, US Vice President Mike Pence said during a visit to Ankara.\n\nThere, the American delegation held talks with the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 a visit that comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two NATO allies.\n\n\u201cToday the United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria,\u201d Pence announced during a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe ceasefire between the Turkish military backed by affiliated militants and the Kurdish-led fighters is set to last 120 hours. This time will be spent on the withdrawal of the Kurdish forces from the 20-mile (32 kilometer) strip along the Syrian border, where Turkey wants to set up a \u201csafe zone.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Erdogan threw Trump\u2019s \u2018don\u2019t be a fool\u2019 letter in the trash \u2013 reports\n\nAccording to a text of the agreement, Ankara promised that the military operation, dubbed \u2018Peace Spring\u2019, will be \"halted upon completion of this withdrawal.\" The \"safe zone\" in question, the text says, \"will be primarily enforced by the Turkish Armed Forces.\"\n\nDuring the 120-hour period no further sanctions - triggered by the Turkish incursion - will be imposed on Ankara. When the ceasefire becomes a \u201cpermanent\u201d one, Washington will cancel the executive restrictions against Turkey, Pence explained.\n\nThe US President Donald Trump, for his part, stated that the sanctions were no longer necessary after the deal had been agreed upon. Hailing the \"amazing\" outcome of the negotiations,Trump also said that it required a \u201ctough love\" to get the deal done.\n\nMeanwhile, the US and Turkish sides managed to produce some conflicting accounts of the meeting. While Pence insisted Ankara promised to not attack the Syrian border town of Kobani, Turkey\u2019s FM later said no such commitments were made.\n\nApart from that, the town \u2013 as well as several other locations close to the country\u2019s border \u2013 was already entered by Syria\u2019s Army, according to state media. Last weekend, Damascus seemingly reached a deal with the Kurds and vowed to protect its soil from \u201cTurkish aggression.\u201d Therefore, it remains unclear whether Ankara will actually press forward with occupying all of its envisioned \u201csafe zone.\u201d\n\n\u2018Peace Spring\u2019 kicked off last Wednesday, targeting the northeastern parts of Syria controlled by the Kurdish-led militias \u2013 namely the so-called Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) group. While the SDF used to be the key US ally in its fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS), Ankara regards the group as an offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK).\n\nAlso on rt.com House condemns Trump\u2019s pullout of US troops they never bothered to authorize to be in Syria at all\n\nThe PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by both Ankara and Washington, has been waging a low-intensity insurgence in Turkey\u2019s southeast for decades.The operation \u2013 repeatedly mulled for months \u2013 began just two days after Trump announced his decision to pull American troops from Syria\u2019s northeast. The move caused an uproar in Washington and was branded a betrayal of the Kurds. As the \u2018Peace Spring\u2019 gained momentum, further US servicemen were pulled out of the combat zone.\n\nAnkara\u2019s offensive drew widespread international condemnation and already resulted in a number of countries suspending arms exports to Turkey. Facing mounting criticism, the US president himself insisted that he had not endorsed the operation by any means, and repeatedly threatened Turkey with \u201cdevastating\u201d sanctions, as well as executively implementing a set of restrictions against it. Ankara fired b ack, saying it will not yield down to any pressure and that it has bee targetiong \"terrorists.\"\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
