It is the cause of 60 percent to 70 percent of cases of dementia. Signs and symptoms: Difficulty remembering newly learned information\n\nDisorientation\n\nMood and behavioral changes\n\nSuspicion about family, friends and professional caregivers\n\nMore serious memory loss\n\nDifficulty with speaking, swallowing and walking Stages of Alzheimer's: Mild Alzheimer's (early-stage) - A person may be able to function independently but is having memory lapses\n\nModerate Alzheimer's (middle-stage) - Typically the longest stage, the person may confuse words, get frustrated or angry, or have sudden behavioral changes\n\nSevere Alzheimer's disease (late-stage) - In the final stage, individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, carry on a conversation and, eventually, control movement.\n\nThe notion that personality traits and the presence of dementia is not new.\n\nBut until now it has not been clear whether it is the disease that cultivates changes in one's personality, or if one's personality can predict the development of dementia.\n\nHowever, by using a sample which spans 54 years, Dr Chapman has been able to conclude that the traits exhibited as a teenager reflect one's risk of suffering dementia as an adult.\n\nHe achieved this by harvesting data from the 1960 Project Talent survey where 5 per cent of US high school students completed two days worth of questionnaires and tests about themselves.\n\nFrom these 377,016 students, 82,232 recently provided Medicare information, allowing Dr Chapman to compare their current well-being to their personality test scores half a century ago.\n\nDuring the 1960 exams, each student was ranked on their sociability, sensitivity, impulsivity, leadership, vigor (outgoing), calm, tidiness (organised), conscientiousness, culture, self-confidence and maturity.\n\nThe paper, published in JAMA Psychiatry journal, hailed its own importance in discovering that personality can be used as a barometer to one's likeliness to get dementia.\n\nDr Chapman and his team concluded: 'Ultimately, the findings herein underscore the importance of considering earlier-life social circumstances and personality in evaluating dementia risk in addition to more recent information.\n\n'Personality phenotype may be a true independent risk factor for dementia by age 70 years, preceding it by almost 5 decades and interacting with adolescent socioeconomic conditions.'", "description": "Researchers from the University of Rochester in New York recorded the character traits of 80,000 high school students in the 1960s.
