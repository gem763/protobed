Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.\n\nDear Reader (Redacted: Harm to Ongoing Matter),\n\nOne of the things I tell new parents is something that was told to me when my daughter still had that new-baby smell: \u201cPrepare for long days but short years.\u201d No statement more succinctly captures the exhaustion, excitement, and melancholy nostalgia that come with parenthood. I have no doubt whole books have not covered it more eloquently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week I had a similar sensation thinking about the two big news stories of the week: The fire at Notre Dame and the release of the Mueller report.\n\nTime may be linear, but our comprehension of it isn\u2019t. All around us events are taking place that we do not perceive as events because they are moving at a pace that we really can\u2019t comprehend. Imagine if you could make a film of the planet earth from its birth to its demise. If you played the movie fast enough, the formation of mountains would look like terrifying clashes between continents. The breakup of Pangaea might look like a jigsaw puzzle thrown into a hot tub. Playing the film a million times slower would still probably make the rise and fall of ancient redwoods seem like nothing more than the instantaneous and momentary emergence of some colors on a canvass. Think of it this way: If you reduced the entire history of the planet to a 24-hour cycle, humans don\u2019t even show up \u2014 some 2 million years ago \u2014 less than one minute before midnight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgainst such a backdrop, the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris emerges and disappears too fast for the naked eye. As for the controversies about Donald Trump, never mind the Mueller report, they take up a fraction of time words cannot capture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you slow things down enough for the mind to take it in, Notre Dame is like a mountain. Not quite eternal in a literal sense, but eternal enough by human standards. As I mentioned the other day, I once wrote and produced a documentary called Notre Dame: Witness to History (I don\u2019t really recommend it; I wasn\u2019t a great TV producer and I certainly didn\u2019t have a great budget). The title was clich\u00e9d but accurate. Notre Dame was the central location for so much of French and really Western history, its scars and embellishments are almost like rings in an ancient tree recording whole eras of Western history. Signs of the Huguenots\u2019 assault on the Church \u2014 and the Church\u2019s assault on the Huguenots \u2014 can be found in its nooks and crannies like the tiny indicia of a plague of locusts in a bisection of an ancient oak. The last time the Spire burned, it was at the hands of the Jacobins who briefly turned Notre Dame into a \u201cTemple of Reason.\u201d\n\nPutting History on a Stop Watch\n\nI bring all this up for a few reasons, not least because the \u201cprocess\u201d for this \u201cnews\u201dletter amounts to taking my brain pan and upending it like a kid emptying his toy chest in search of the Lego pieces required to build a time machine. The controversies of the day are important, but they are like the crises of parenthood: Hugely important in the moment, but likely to turn into the faintest squiggles in the tree rings of time. That\u2019s not foreordained, of course. There are daily crises with your kids that can turn into existential ones \u2014 as anyone who\u2019s taken their child to an emergency room can attest \u2014 which is one of the reasons the days of parenthood can feel so much longer than the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the right terms are, but there\u2019s an analogy here. Some controversies are important (and some are just incredibly stupid) but they are important in the moment alone. Others transcend the fierce urgency of now and apply across generations. For some, climate change is precisely such a challenge. For others, it is the civilizational friction between the Muslim world and the rest, or the rivalries between America and China. The Cold War was certainly larger than any confirmation battle or scandal.\n\nThe most worthwhile daily arguments are the ones that work within a timeline measured by more than 15-minute increments in a Nielsen report on last night\u2019s cable ratings. For instance, Jussie Smollett\u2019s transgressions are great for feeding the ratings beast, but they are only significant to the extent they illuminate the larger dysfunction of a culture that encourages racial hoaxes because we have turned victims into heroes. And even then, that context is usually used as a pretext just to keep jaw-jawing and preening for the perpetual outrage machine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m the first to admit that it is hard to know where to draw the lines between seriousness and exploitation, or mere infotainment, particularly since this \u201cnews\u201dletter darts back and forth across the borders like the Viet Cong running the Ho Chi Minh trail. But one of the things I despise about the current moment is how the Big Things are so often turned into just another Twitter controversy and the Small Things are elevated into existential crises of the first order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump, lacking anything like a historical memory, is fond of claiming that this or that outrage or accomplishment is the worst or best thing \u201cever.\u201d \u201cOur African American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they\u2019ve ever been in before,\u201d Trump declared in 2016. \u201cEver, ever, ever.\u201d That might have been news to the Africans-Americans lynched in the 1920s or the Africans auctioned off in Charleston in the 1820s. I still laugh whenever I think about Sebastian Gorka ranting about the alleged FISA warrant abuses of the Obama administration. \u201cIt has to be put in the context of the history of our great nation,\u201d he said in expert-mode. \u201cThis is 100 times bigger.\u201d More recently he explained that the Democrats were a continuation of Stalinism because they\u2019re coming for our hamburgers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWestern Civilization 0, Twitter 1\n\nThe other day Ben Shapiro offered what should have been an utterly banal statement about the fire at Notre Dame:\n\nAbsolutely heartbreaking. A magnificent monument to Western civilization collapsing. https://t.co/UajArjkt2g \u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) April 15, 2019\n\nNow, I have no problem with quibbles (and neither does Ben) from Catholics who point out that Notre Dame was a monument to the glory of God and what Catholics believe to be the One True Church as delineated in the Nicene Creed. But, I doubt any of those Catholics took offense at what Ben said. And if they did, they should probably lighten up. I\u2019d also point out that Cathedrals were the space programs of their day (\u201cThe Knights Templar were the first Space Force\u201d: Discuss). Cities and nations constantly competed to see who could build the tallest Cathedral \u2014 which is why most are built on the tallest ground available. The idea was both theological and political. Theologically, the idea was to get as close to God as possible. Politically, it was a desire for, well, national greatness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, what I have a huge problem with is the bonfire of asininity that ignited from people who think \u201cWestern civilization\u201d is a term reserved solely for the alt-right and other bigots (David French addressed the point well here). In a piece about Ben\u2019s excellent book on Western civilization \u2014 I\u2019ll reserve my quibbles for later \u2014 The Economist labeled him an \u201calt-right sage\u201d and a \u201cpop idol of the alt right.\u201d To The Economist\u2019s credit, they retracted and apologized. But the immediate assumption that praise for, or pride in, Western civilization is a species of bigotry and racism is a perfect example of the sort of civilizational suicide I describe in my own book on the subject.\n\nSo adamantine is this absurdity that some Shapiro haters actually assume he\u2019s not actually saying he thinks the West is superior, only \u201ctacitly\u201d suggesting it.\n\nI wasn't tacitly saying Western civilization is superior to other civilizations. I openly say it, because I believe Western civilization is superior to other civilizations. In fact, I wrote an entire book on the topic, in which I explain why. https://t.co/5xxT67KKj6 https://t.co/u02Ju84WmH \u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) April 16, 2019\n\nBen might as well be standing in the center of Times Square waving a giant foam finger that reads \u201cWestern Civ #1\u201d on it. But the idea is so offensive to some people they think he wouldn\u2019t dare say it outright.\n\nWhat\u2019s So Great about Western Civilization?\n\nI\u2019ve covered much of this at length \u2014 book length but also in this G-File \u2014 elsewhere. So I\u2019ll go in a slightly different direction.\n\nForget calling it Western civilization for a moment. Instead think of a kind of party platform with a bunch of planks:\n\nSupport for human rights\n\nBelief in the rule of law\n\nDedication to democracy\n\nFree speech\n\nFreedom of conscience\n\nAdmiration for science and the scientific method\n\nCuriosity about other cultures\n\nProperty rights\n\nTolerance or celebration of technological and/or cultural innovation\n\nI\u2019ll be generous and stipulate that 90 percent of the people who are offended by pride in Western civilization actually believe \u2014 or think they believe \u2014 in most or all of these things. They just have a problem connecting the dots, so I\u2019ll try.\n\nWhere do they think most of these ideas come from? Where were they most successfully put into action? What civilization today or in some bygone era manifests these values more? Chinese civilization? Islamic civilization? Aztec? African? Indian? Persian? Turkish?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to belittle any of those cultures, nor deny their contributions to human history. I\u2019m not even trying to argue \u2013 here, at least \u2014 that Western civilization is objectively superior in some scientific or God\u2019s-eye-view sense. As with the debates over nationalism, there\u2019s no arguing \u2014 and no reason to argue \u2014 with a French patriot about whether or not America is \u201cbetter\u201d than France. I would think less of a Spaniard who didn\u2019t love Spain more than he or she loves France. It\u2019s like arguing whose family is better, we love what is ours. As Bill Buckley liked to say, De gustibus non est disputandum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the weird thing is that many of the people who are outraged by benign nationalism or the benign pan-nationalism that is pride in Western civilization take no umbrage when someone from Iran or China says they think their civilization is best. This of course is a manifestation of the ancient cult of identitarianism, which the best traditions of the West have battled internally at great cost for thousands of years. Saying Western civilization is great hurts the feelings of some people invested in some other source of identity. And it hurts the feelings of some Westerners because they think it\u2019s a sign of enlightenment to get offended on other people\u2019s behalf or to denigrate the society that gave them their soap box.\n\nThe irony is that the willingness to entertain the possibility that some other culture has something important to offer or say to us is actually one of the hallmarks of Western civilization (and the condescension with which many Americans treat other cultures is also a more regrettable side of Western culture). We \u201cborrow\u201d stuff from other cultures constantly, starting with Christianity itself.\n\nThis is particularly true of America, which is why our menus read like the requested meal plans from a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. This profound lack of self-awareness manifests itself most acutely among progressives who wear their Europe-envy on their sleeves. Oh, they\u2019re so much more civilized over there. Well, what civilization do you think \u201cover there\u201d is part of?\n\nWestern civilization is a work in progress because that\u2019s what civilization means. If you want a Cliff\u2019s Notes version of what my book was about it\u2019s simply this: Every generation, humans start from scratch. As Hannah Arendt said, every generation Western civilization is invaded by barbarians \u2014 we call them \u201cchildren.\u201d As babies we come into the world with the same programming as Viking, Hun or caveman babies. These barbarians need to be civilized and that\u2019s a job primarily done by families, which is why the days are long and the years are short. We teach barbarians how to be citizens in the broadest sense of the word, through formal education, religious teaching, social norms and the modeling of proper behavior. In other words, we assimilate people into a culture.\n\nAs Alan Wolfe writes in his discussion of Immanuel Kant:\n\nAs cultivating a field yields a better product, the arts and sciences cultivate us by improving the quality of who we are. No wonder, then, that when we look for a term that expresses the way we improve upon nature, we use \u201cculture,\u201d which has the same root as \u201ccultivate.\u201d And civilization\u2014expressed in German not only as Zivilisation but also as Kultur \u2014 far from corrupting our soul, makes it possible for us to bring good out of evil.\n\nThe way you sustain and improve upon a culture is by fostering a sense of gratitude for what is best about it. You celebrate the good in your story while putting the bad in the correct context. Conservatism is gratitude, and as I noted on Fox the other night, one of the most compelling things in reaction the fire of Notre Dame was seeing how many people recognized their own ingratitude for this jewel of their own civilization. The Church was in peril because the French took it for granted. But, like that feeling one gets deep in the soul when a loved one in peril, millions were overcome with a sense of what they might lose. And now France is devoting itself to restoring what was almost lost.\n\nHas Western civilization made mistakes? Sure (cue the Monty Python skit about Rome). Terrible things have been done in its name, a statement one can make about every civilization that has ever existed. But to say that the mistakes define us more than the accomplishments is suicidally stupid. And if you subscribe to those planks I mentioned above, I\u2019d like to suggest that telling people they\u2019re bigots for taking pride in the civilization that brought them forth better than any other is like taking a sledgehammer to the soapbox you\u2019re standing on.\n\nAnd to do it in the name of virtue tweeting is one of the purer forms of asininity.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nCanine Update: Pippa\u2019s limp keeps coming back when she overdoes it, which is a challenge since Pippa only has a handful of settings. Overdrive, waiting for opportunities for overdrive and recharging after overdrive. Zo\u00eb in her middle age has a richer emotional range. We\u2019ll be taking her to the vet if it persists. Some readers have suggested it might be from an infection like Lyme disease. We\u2019ve seen that sort of thing before. Zo\u00eb once had a terrible infection from a tick bite, that cleared up very quickly with the right medication, but it was scary how fast and severe it came on. But they remain decidedly happy beasts. Though it seems like they have a problem with Bernie Sanders.\n\nSome of my Twitter followers have protested about Gracie, AKA the good cat, getting equal time in my feed. They think it\u2019s \u201coff-brand.\u201d I get it, but she\u2019s such an exceptionally good cat (admittedly graded on a feline curve) and besides my daughter lobbies on her behalf so much, that I think you\u2019ll just have to put up with it. Besides, I find her contempt for the dogs hilarious.\n\nI\u2019ll be on Meet the Press this Sunday.\n\nOh, and if you\u2019re curious about what\u2019s going with my next thing, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t share much right now. But you should check in to my personal website from time to time for updates.
