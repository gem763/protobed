Always. When he was angry,\" the Swede told The Times .\n\n\"And never 'Hello Sven, how are you?' It was \u201cwhuurssshhhh\u201d [yelling]. I thought he should kill me.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\n\"He said, 'I will kill you. You are finished.'\n\n\"But I represented England and you have to stand up.\n\n\"What\u2019s right is right and what\u2019s wrong is wrong and when you say 'Don\u2019t pick Rooney because I\u2019m going to kill you'... I said, 'F*** off, what\u2019s going on with you?'\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\n\"And he was screaming. Whenever he got like that... it has no meaning.\n\n\"That\u2019s why I was, 'Alex, I will pick Rooney. Now, have a nice holiday. Ciao, bye'\".\n\nAfter England Eriksson, now 71, went on to have a nomadic managerial career, taking charge of Manchester City , Mexico, Ivory Coast, Leicester City, Guangzhou R&F, Shanghai SIPG, Shenzhen and the Philippines.", "description": "The former England boss detailed his clashes with the Manchester United icon over the selection of his star player", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Allsport", "Press Association", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20570763.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sven-Goran-Eriksson-Football.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
