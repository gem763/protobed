REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman/Files\n\nWhile Airbus aircraft built in Europe will be hit with a tariff of 10% after the World Trade Organization allowed Washington to impose sanctions on EU goods, semi-finished fuselages and wings are exempted, an official list showed.\n\nThat means large parts shipped to the deep-sea Alabama port of Mobile from plants in Europe will not be hit by the duties, allowing Airbus to continue to supply U.S.-based airlines with a limited number of locally assembled aircraft.\n\n\u201cEarlier today, we received confirmation from Airbus of very positive news that parts and components used at the final assembly plant in Mobile will not be subject to tariffs,\u201d said George Talbot, spokesman for the city of Mobile.\n\n\u201cThere is a great sense of relief and gratitude about the outcome.\u201d\n\nFrance-based Airbus opened the Mobile plant in 2015, widening its international footprint from existing assembly lines in Europe and China.\n\nThe Alabama plant produces four A320-family jets a month, a relatively small part of the Airbus total, but is seen as important to the company\u2019s plans to raise output globally. U.S. rival Boeing Co (BA.N) has large manufacturing operations in the north of the state.\n\nMobile city leaders and Alabama lawmakers had lobbied hard for exemptions from the tariffs, arguing they could jeopardise some 1,000 jobs.\n\nAlabama\u2019s largely conservative voters supported U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and he continues to poll very strongly in the state.\n\nThe surprise decision to omit imported aircraft sections came in a list of tariffs that was smaller in percentage terms and in scope than initially signalled by Washington.\n\nThe United States said on Wednesday it expected the European Union to enter negotiations but stressed it also had authority to increase the tariffs or alter the products affected.\n\nNORTHERN IRELAND REPRIEVE\n\nAlso spared by the decision to exempt imported aircraft parts were wings made in Northern Ireland for smaller Airbus A220 aircraft, which had been drawn into a separate row in 2017.\n\nThe planes are mainly built in Canada where they were originally designed by industrial group Bombardier (BBDb.TO) before Airbus bought the loss-making programme last year.\n\nBut in August, Airbus also began building the planes in Mobile, adding plans for 400 jobs to 850 already in place.\n\nA dispute over low prices for the jets sucked Boeing into a three-way trade row with Canada and Britain in 2017 and caused a political storm about politically sensitive jobs in Belfast.\n\nFor now, both those jobs and the new A220 jobs in Alabama appear to be sheltered from the latest dispute.\n\nAirbus said it was evaluating the tariff list in close collaboration with the European Commission.\n\nDespite relief over Airbus, Alabama is bracing for tariffs that could hit Germany\u2019s Daimler, which operates a large Mercedes auto plant in Tuscaloosa, beginning next month.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose 25% tariffs on imported cars from Germany and elsewhere in Europe.", "description": "Alabama aerospace workers won an unexpected reprieve from escalating trade tensions on Wednesday when the United States spared an Airbus plant in the state from the impact of tariffs against the European planemaker - at least for now.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436472075&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9202E"}
