But with the clock ticking down, Nketiah headed an equaliser to delight the 5,500 travelling fans.\n\nThe most that Bielsa was willing to concede afterwards was that Nketiah will get his chance at some point; his words seemed designed as much to protect the out-of-form Bamford as to calm any hype around the new arrival.", "description": "Eddie Nketiah surely will not have to wait much longer for his first league start in a Leeds United shirt;", "authors": ["Mike Whalley", "Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213818613-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwSRU4a2mV9NEyTJpjZttoSQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
