Meghan, in particular, has been attacked for her personality, the colour of her skin, her past relationships, her family, the way she dresses, the way she speaks, her acting career, her relationship with Harry, motherhood \u2013 the list goes on and on\u2026 and on.\n\n\u201cI never thought that this would be easy,\u201d Meghan said in the doco. \u201cBut I thought it would be fair and that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really hard to reconcile.\u201d\n\nIn an open letter addressed to Meghan, 72 female members of Britain\u2019s parliament called out the frankly horrible treatment she\u2019s copped from the tabloids.\n\n\u201cAs women MPs of all political persuasions, we wanted to express our solidarity with you in taking a stand against the often distasteful and misleading nature of the stories printed in a number of our national newspapers concerning you, your character, and your family.\u201d\n\nThe leaders also torched the tabloids for its often \u201coutdated, colonial undertones\u201d of some of these stories.\n\n\u201cAs women Members of Parliament from all backgrounds, we stand with you in saying it cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.\u201d\n\nDespite their different roles, the MPs said they share an understanding of the abuse and intimidation Meghan has copped, which has distracted them all from getting on with their work and lives.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind we expect the national media to have the integrity to know when a story is in the national interest, and when it is seeking to tear a woman down for no apparent reason.\n\n\u201cYou have our assurances that we stand with you in solidarity on this. We will use the means at our disposal to ensure that our press accept your right to privacy and show respect, and that their stories reflect the truth.\u201d\n\nWomen MPs from all political parties have put aside our differences to stand in solidarity with the Duchess of Sussex today and are sending her this open letter. pic.twitter.com/ytLHG5qPf4 \u2014 Holly Lynch MP (@HollyLynch5) October 29, 2019\n\nMeghan is suing British newspaper The Mail on Sunday after it published a handwritten letter she had sent her father. Meghan\u2019s decision was strongly backed by Harry, who recently released a statement denouncing the \u201cruthless campaign\u201d of some tabloids.\n\n\u201cFor these select media this is a game, and one that we have been unwilling to play from the start,\u201d Harry wrote. \u201cI have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u201d", "description": "More than 70 British female MPs have expressed their solidarity with\u00a0Meghan Markle\u00a0over the treatment she's copped from the press", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178516658-1024x682.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
