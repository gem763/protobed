You sell the site at time of death for a finite amount, but then have an endless expectation of maintenance.\"\n\nNeustein and his wife Grace Mortlock have a similar notion, but on a wider scale. The couple are currently presenting their concept Burial Belt \u2013 wide-scale land set aside for natural burials that also doubles as a suburban green wedge \u2013 at the Oslo Architecture Triennale.\n\n\"A lot of eucalypts take about 15 years to reach maturity,\" Neustein says. \"Fifteen years is also, coincidentally \u2013 when it\u2019s the right type of soil \u2013 about how long people need to decompose.\"\n\nYou can\u2019t look forward to death, but you can look forward to a good death and a send-off that makes you more at one with the world. \u2014 David Neustein, architect\n\nBurial Belts would also act as a natural boundary preventing urban sprawl on typically low-grade grazing land that was frequently rezoned for housing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It will be less vulnerable to being subdivided,\" Neustein says. \"It\u2019s a much stronger restraint to development than a protected species. It\u2019s like using society\u2019s taboos about death in a productive way. That land is protected as a burial space.\"\n\nHartley's Earth Funerals is going through planning for its first 1.5-hectare site in Armidale in NSW. It is also assessing separate sites outside Melbourne and Adelaide.\n\nLand set aside for natural burial \u2013 without casket, without concrete footings and without marble tombstones \u2013 would be planted with trees once it reaches capacity. Other Architects\n\nEven in such a natural environment, loved ones can also have a permanent marker \u2013 a requirement of zoned graveyards \u2013 by utilising augmented reality and GPS location technology.\n\n\"You can design a memorial that means something to you but is only visible to you, your extended community, family and friends, and doesn\u2019t impact on someone else\u2019s enjoyment of that space,\" Neustein says.\n\n\"Instead of a physical structure, it remains as natural environment. Only through technology are you able to visualise the presence of a grave within it.\"\n\nIt wouldn't be for everyone, but natural burials offer a way to use cheaply priced land on the outskirts of cities to remember loved ones, create green space and plant much-needed carbon-absorbing trees, he says.\n\n\"You can\u2019t look forward to death, but you can look forward to a good death and a send-off that makes you more at one with the world,\" Neustein says.", "description": "Natural burials offer both a memorial and a way to remediate land.
