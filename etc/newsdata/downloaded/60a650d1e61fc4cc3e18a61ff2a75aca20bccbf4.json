Instead, a mix of private-sector companies and a few municipally owned utilities generate electricity, transmit and distribute that power to households and industries under long-term contracts.\n\nLast week, Perimeter Solar Inc., backed by Danish solar power investor Obton AS, announced Sept. 30 that it had struck a deal to supply Calgary-based pipeline giant TC Energy Corp. with 74.25 megawatts of electricity from a new 130-MW solar power project immediately south of Calgary. Neither company disclosed the costs of the transaction or the project.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased that of all the potential off-takers in the market for energy, we have signed with a company as reputable as TC Energy,\u201d Obton CEO Anders Marcus said in a release announcing the deal, which it called \u201cthe largest negotiated energy supply agreement with a North American energy company.\u201d\n\nPerimeter expects to break ground on the project, which will more than double the amount of solar power being produced in the province, by the end of this year.\n\nA report published Monday by the Energy Information Administration, a unit of the U.S. Department of Energy, estimated that renewable energy powered 3 per cent of Canada\u2019s energy consumption in 2018.\n\nBetween the Claresholm project and other planned solar installations, utility companies are poised to install far more solar power than the province is currently planning for.\n\nUniversity of Calgary adjunct professor Blake Shaffer said it was \u201cironic\u201d that the Claresholm Solar project was announced the exact same day as the Alberta Electric System Operator released a forecast that under-projected the amount of solar in the province\u2019s electric grid.\n\nThe AESO released its forecast on Sept. 30, which predicted that solar power projects would provide just 1 per cent of Alberta\u2019s electricity supply by 2030 at 231 megawatts.\n\nShaffer said the AESO, which manages and operates the province\u2019s electricity grid, is assuming that on a levelized basis solar power will need a price over $100 per megawatt hour for new investment. However, he said, based on recent auctions for government infrastructure projects, the cost is closer to $70 MW/h.\n\nMost forecasting organizations like the International Energy Agency have had to adjust their forecasts for solar power adoption higher in the past, as growth of the renewable energy source has outperformed expectations.\n\nCalgary-based Greengate Power has also proposed a $500-million, 400-MW solar project near Vulcan, a town roughly one-hour by car southeast of Calgary.\n\n\u201cSo now we\u2019re getting close to 700 MW (of solar power),\u201d Shaffer said, which is three times the AESO forecast.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Project breaking ground this year backed by foreign investor will more than double this energy source in province", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/solar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
