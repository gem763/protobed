More than a decade of low interest rates has encouraged companies to issue more debt, while investors looking for better returns have pushed into riskier bank loans and lower-rated bonds that pay higher returns.\n\n\u201cShould we be cognizant of the growth in corporate debt, who holds that debt and the potential ramifications for our markets and our economy?\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we should.\u201d\n\nMr. Clayton said regulators would have to examine the effects of this leverage as bond prices continue to rise, fueled by concerns of an economic slowdown.\n\nHe added that \u201cmany economic indicators are very strong\u201d but that regulators must consider how investors will respond if conditions change.\n\n\u201cThe upside has become more limited, while the downside has not improved,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "description": "Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, chided counterparts around the world for spotty enforcement of antibribery laws.", "authors": ["Dave Michaels"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105285/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
