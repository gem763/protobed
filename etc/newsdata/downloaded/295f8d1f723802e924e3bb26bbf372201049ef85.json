Stewart: The Truth About the \u2018Deep State,\u2019 Donald Trump, and Jeffrey Epstein", "language": "en", "text": "Early in his career covering the financial industry, law enforcement and the unsightly pageant of American politics, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist James B. Stewart spent quality time with both Hillary Clinton during her husband\u2019s first term in the 1990s and Donald Trump in the late 1980s.\n\nOne was an activist first lady who, like Bill Clinton, was bitterly resentful of media scrutiny and had hoped to enlist Stewart\u2014a best-selling author whose just-published 10th book is Deep State: Trump, The FBI, and The Rule of Law\u2014to expose the rank unfairness of the press coverage of the Clintons and certify their probity and honesty.\n\nThe other was an outer-borough apartment building scion who was trying to recast himself as a high-flying corporate raider and wanted Stewart, then a Wall Street Journal reporter, to validate his status and acumen.\n\nNeither the Clintons nor Trump succeeded.\n\n\u201cHe invited me up to Trump Tower and said, \u2018This is completely off the record, deep background,\u2019\u201d Stewart told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re sitting there and the secretary walked in and said \u2018Mrs. So-and-so is here.\u2019 And Trump says, \u2018Show her in\u2019\u2014so much for being deep background, off-the-record. And so she walked in and he said, \u2018This is Mrs. So-and-so\u2019\u2014I don\u2019t remember her name, but she was from the Philippines\u2014\u2018and she is the richest woman in the world.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Ohhh, interesting, I never heard of her. I thought the Queen was the richest woman in the world.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then he turned to her and said, \u2018James Stewart from the Wall Street Journal is here interviewing me. He is the most famous reporter in America.\u2019 At which point I knew she was not the richest woman in the world,\u201d Stewart recalled, adding he found the future president \u201ccharming and funny in kind of a mean way,\u201d but that he politely declined Trump\u2019s offers of a free flight on the Trump Shuttle, his money-losing airline that was soon to go under, a ride to La Guardia airport in his limo and, later on, persistent invitations to prize fights in Atlantic City.\n\n\u201cHe was always trying to get me to take something,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cFortunately, I had no interest in boxing. I had no interest in gambling.\u201d\n\nThe dapperly dressed Stewart, who happened to be celebrating his 68th birthday, was holding forth in a midtown Manhattan coffee emporium across the street from the New York Times, where he has been a star on the Business section since 2011.\n\nHe said he was currently toiling on an investigative report concerning the late Jeffrey Epstein, the plutocrat-pedophile whom Stewart visited at his Upper East Side mansion in August 2018. Stewart refused to provide details on his research or when he hopes to publish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at a delicate stage,\u201d he said.\n\nIn August, after Epstein was found hanged in his jail cell, apparently by his own hand, Stewart wrote a controversial column about their off-the-record encounter. At the time Stewart explained that he\u2019d met with Epstein because he was trying to ascertain if rumors were true that Tesla tycoon Elon Musk had asked the convicted sex offender to represent him in his search for a new CEO, and concluded that there was no credible evidence for that.\n\nStewart wrote that he declined Epstein\u2019s offer to cooperate with a book-length biography, and also spurned Epstein\u2019s invitation to have dinner with him, Michael Wolff and Woody Allen. Stewart told The Daily Beast that such an encounter would have been journalistically useless, to say nothing of the unattractive optics.\n\n\u201cHow creepy is that?\u201d he scoffed.\n\nStewart won\u2019t say precisely who cooperated with his latest book, beyond on-the-record interviews with fired FBI Director James Comey and, surprisingly, Steve Bannon\u2014who makes a cameo appearance to mock the \u201cDeep State\u201d conspiracy theory, embraced by Trump, that a cabal of faceless government bureaucrats are staging a secret coup against the duly elected president.\n\nThe \u201cdeep state conspiracy theory is for nut cases,\u201d Stewart approvingly quotes Bannon. \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t Turkey or Egypt,\u201d Bannon says, adding that while there\u2019s an entrenched bureaucracy, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing \u2018deep\u2019 about it. It\u2019s right in your face.\u201d\n\nComey, meanwhile, tells Stewart: \u201cThere\u2019s no Deep State looking to bring down elected officials and political leaders that represents a deep-seated center of power\u2026 But it\u2019s true in a way that should cause Americans to sleep better at night. There\u2019s a culture in the military, in the intelligence agencies, and in law enforcement that\u2019s rooted in the rule of law and reverence for the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201c America depends on institutions. And it depends on people functioning in those institutions whose first loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law\u2014not to an individual who may happen to be president at one time or another. \u201d\n\nA careful reading of Deep State suggests that Stewart managed to secure the cooperation of Comey\u2019s fired interim successor, former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe (who wrote his own book about recent events) and former FBI in-house counsel Lisa Page and top agent Peter Strzok, the so-called \u201cgaga lovers,\u201d per Trump\u2019s toxic Twitter feed.\n\nPage and Strzok lost their jobs after the public release of text messages in which the two, who were married to other people, not only indicated they\u2019d been having an affair, but were insulting and critical of the former reality television star who went on to become the 45th president.\n\n\u201cAmerica depends on institutions,\u201d Stewart said about the overarching theme of Deep State . \u201cAnd it depends on people functioning in those institutions whose first loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law\u2014not to an individual who may happen to be president at one time or another. I want people to understand that and respect the fact when people act on behalf of the interests of the Constitution and the American people, it\u2019s not an act of betrayal. It\u2019s the highest form of patriotism.\u201d\n\nA few years after that Trump Tower meeting, during Bill Clinton\u2019s first term as the 42nd president, Hillary\u2019s close friend Susan Thomases, then a securities lawyer and managing partner at the blue-chip law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, arranged a meeting between Stewart and the first couple at the White House.\n\n\u201cThey initiated my book,\u201d Stewart said, referring to Blood Sport, his 1997 best-seller that chronicled the pre-Monica Lewinsky scandals, which included the conspiracy theory-inducing suicide of deputy White House counsel and Hillary intimate Vince Foster. \u201cThey sent an emissary [Thomases] to me saying, \u2018We\u2019re being persecuted by the press,\u2019 and she said, \u2018They want you to do a book and they have nothing to hide. They\u2019ll show you everything.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo I went to the White House and met them\u2014Bill was delayed, delayed, delayed, and finally popped in to say hi\u2014and I spent most of the time with Hillary\u2026 They were supposed to be interviewing me. But Hillary did all the talking. \u2018We\u2019re being persecuted. The media\u2019s so unfair. We have nothing to hide.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd I chimed in and said, \u2018I hope that\u2019s true, because I\u2019m going to do my usual thorough job, and once I go down this path and sign a deal, this is my livelihood, there\u2019s no turning back.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Oh yeah, we understand that. That\u2019s fine.\u2019 That was the high-water mark of our relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201c Every time I came out of my hotel, I think somebody reported back to the White House. \u201d\n\nWhen the Clintons failed to provide promised documents and canceled scheduled interviews, Stewart decamped to Little Rock, Arkansas, \u201cand everybody was eager to talk,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd somehow word got back to the White House that I spoke to the state troopers [who were members of Bill Clinton\u2019s security detail when he was Arkansas governor]. I did talk to the troopers. I was talking to everybody, and boy, did I get an earful.\u201d\n\nStewart soon had the strange feeling that his movements in Little Rock were being monitored by a local network of Clinton loyalists. \u201cEvery time I came out of my hotel, I think somebody reported back to the White House. I later heard that the minute they [the Clintons] heard I talked to the troopers, it was over. And they never spoke to me again.\u201d\n\nDecades later, Trump and the Clintons are central figures in Stewart\u2019s latest book, from which neither party emerges unscathed.\n\nOn the other hand, Comey, whom Stewart has known and reported on since Comey\u2019s days as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, comes across as something of a hero\u2014albeit a flawed one\u2014who risked his career and reputation in order to resist Trump\u2019s misuse of presidential power.\n\n\u201cI knew Comey and held him in very high regard. Comey tells the truth. I have never known him to lie,\u201d said Stewart, a non-practicing attorney who graduated from Harvard Law School and spent a few years as an associate at Cravath, Swaine & Moore before returning to his first love, journalism. He was a summer intern at his small-town Missouri newspaper, the Quincy Herald-Whig, and also worked on the undergraduate newspaper at Indiana\u2019s DePauw University.\n\n\u201c The minute he\u2019s caught red-handed, he immediately\u2014in Roy Cohn fashion\u2014turns the attack on the people who are criticizing him. \u201d\n\nIn the end, Deep State is \u201ca thriller, full of intrigue and drama,\u201d as Stewart puts it, featuring a mendacious, bullying president driven by ego and self-interest, his hand-picked enablers in government, and diligent public servants and denizens of the \u201cdeep state\u201d like Comey and his interim successor, fired acting director Andrew McCabe\u2014and even former in-house counsel Lisa Page and and fired agent Peter Strzok\u2014who attempted, with limited success, to foil Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert the Constitution.\n\nAlthough Stewart was compelled to finish Deep State months before the latest White House horror\u2014namely the formal impeachment inquiry prompted by Trump\u2019s apparent attempt to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden in return for military aid\u2014Stewart argued it\u2019s not a problem.\n\n\u201cAll the behavior that Trump has now exhibited is amply dramatized in my book,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s impulsive. He doesn\u2019t listen to people giving him advice\u2014even more so now. The minute he\u2019s caught red-handed, he immediately\u2014in Roy Cohn fashion\u2014turns the attack on the people who are criticizing him. If you reveal embarrassing behavior by him, you\u2019re a quote-unquote traitor, with the implication that you should be given some kind of death penalty. And he lies constantly. Constantly. All that behavior is here.\u201d\n\nIn Deep State, meanwhile, Stewart provides the most detailed\u2014and damning\u2014account to date of Bill Clinton\u2019s ill-considered June 27, 2016 visit with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on a Justice Department jet parked in Phoenix. Amazingly, this occurred during the FBI\u2019s ongoing investigation of Hillary\u2019s mishandling of classified emails as secretary of state, a probe that was threatening to derail her presidential campaign.\n\nEver loquacious\u2014after Lynch welcomed him aboard against her better judgment\u2014the former president ignored the attorney general\u2019s repeated protests that she had to go, took a seat in the cabin and talked her ear off about the Arizona heat, Brexit, globalization, West Virginia coal miners, and other weird topics.\n\n\u201cThat Bill Clinton would be so tone-deaf as to initiate an extended private conversation with the attorney general, the very person weighing criminal charges against his wife, just five days before her FBI interview astonished Lynch\u2019s staff,\u201d Stewart writes.\n\nStewart told The Daily Beast: \u201cOh my God, Clinton! I\u2019m sure it\u2019s subconscious\u2026 The person with him said, \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea,\u2019 and yet he bludgeons his way up there, plops down, lingers for such a long period of time that it made everyone question, \u2018What the hell are they talking about?\u2019 Was he trying to undermine his wife? That\u2019s crazy! He couldn\u2019t have done a better job. It was a disaster for her.\u201d\n\nArguably, however, the person who comes out worst of all is Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2014who was widely portrayed in the press as \u201chonorable\u201d and \u201ca straight-shooter\u201d when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the ongoing Russia investigation and Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel.\n\n\u201c What happened to Rosenstein the following week? Obviously he was deeply upset and bouncing off the walls and coming up with these wild ideas. \u201d\n\n\u201cLook, he was in an impossible situation. What should he have done in his position?\u201d Stewart said, citing the notorious memo Trump ordered Rosenstein to write as the justification for sacking James Comey\u2014i.e., that the FBI director had overstepped his authority and violated Justice Department policy in the bureau\u2019s investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal.\n\n\u201cI guess if it was me, I would have resigned the day of [Trump\u2019s] phony story that, \u2018The reason I\u2019m firing Comey is because of the way he dealt with the Clintons\u2019,\u201d Stewart continued. \u201cWhat happened to Rosenstein the following week? Obviously he was deeply upset and bouncing off the walls and coming up with these wild ideas\u201d\u2014notably Rosenstein\u2019s suggestion that Cabinet officials be persuaded to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump as president, and his offer to wear a wire into the Oval Office to catch Trump saying something incriminating.\n\nIn neither case was Rosenstein joking, Stewart\u2019s books recounts\u2014contradicting Rosenstein\u2019s spin that he was merely being \u201csarcastic.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was coming unglued. By the way, there are many witnesses to this,\u201d Stewart pointed out.\n\nIn Deep State, Stewart quotes Comey, after Trump nominated Rosenstein to be the Justice Department\u2019s No. 2, as musing prophetically to his friend Benjamin Wittes that Rosenstein was essentially \u201ca survivor\u201d who might compromise his principles to keep his job.\n\n\u201c Everybody I interviewed was interviewed by Mueller, so I know he knows the whole story. So Rosenstein was mysteriously spared in the Mueller report. \u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, oh my God, does that turn out to be true,\u201d Stewart told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere were two occasions when people were writing the stories that Rosenstein was going to be fired\u201d\u2014after Rosenstein\u2019s \u201cwild ideas\u201d were widely reported. \u201cHe goes in for a one-on-one with Trump and miraculously he comes out with his job intact.\u201d\n\nNoting that Rosenstein was Mueller\u2019s boss, Stewart said that if Mueller had agreed to speak to him for the book\u2014which he didn\u2019t\u2014\u201cthere are two questions I wanted to ask him. One is, why isn\u2019t Rosenstein in the Mueller report except in passing? None of that stuff about the week after [Comey\u2019s firing] is in there. Everybody I interviewed was interviewed by Mueller, so I know he knows the whole story. So Rosenstein was mysteriously spared in the Mueller report.\u201d\n\nStewart\u2019s second question: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Mueller insist on testimony from Trump specifically on obstruction of justice? Because he allowed Trump to refuse to testify about obstruction. No prosecutor I know would accept a deal like that. There are communications between Mueller and Rosenstein and Rosenstein and Trump that I don\u2019t know. All I know is that whatever Rosenstein said to Trump, he kept his job.\u201d\n\nStewart speculated that because the president was keenly aware that Rosenstein had recommended removing him from office and offered to wear a wire to gather evidence against him. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that Trump would have kept him on if he wasn\u2019t able to use that leverage to get something in return. Again, I\u2019m not privy to those conversations. But if I was a fly on the wall, the one thing I would have loved to have heard is the back and forth between the two of them.\u201d\n\nDeep State: Trump, The FBI and The Rule of Law by James B.
