That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.\n\nThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.\n\nAnd it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple's set-top box.\n\nApple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.\n\nThe company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.", "description": "Apple's new iPhone software update is about to arrive \u2013 though not in its final form. iOS 13 will make its way to iPhones\u00a0within hours, at which point it can be easily downloaded through the phone's settings.
