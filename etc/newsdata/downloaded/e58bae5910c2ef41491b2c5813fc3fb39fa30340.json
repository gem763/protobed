China bought 14.7 million tonnes of iron ore from Iran in 2018, accounting for 1.4% of its total imports.\n\n\"Applying such export tariffs from this month is too early,\" said Keyvan Jafari Tehrani, an independent analyst of the iron and steel industry.\n\n\"I doubt whether the quantities (Iran) used to sell to China can be absorbed totally by the local market at the beginning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Min Zhang and Shivani Singh in Beijing; Additional reporting by Parisa Hafezi in Teheran; Editing by Tom Hogue)", "description": "China has taken fewer shipments of iron ore from Iran over August and September, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, as additional export tariffs due to be imposed by Tehran have dampened risk appetites in the world's biggest steelmaker.
