Paul Scholes\u2019 one-touch, no-look, perfectly weighted pass towards Tim Cahill in Vincent Kompany\u2019s testimonial set social media agog overnight and, this weekend, will presumably send parents sprawling as they look to replicate it in front of their children in the local park. It was, as more than one commenter pointed out, a flourish so delightful that Robin van Persie virtually fought Cahill to be its rightful recipient.\n\nJoleon Lescott, completely foxed by Scholes\u2019s slice on the half-volley, scampered after the situation with the look of a man who had never had to deal with anything like this during a 17-year career. But then nobody watching had seen much to compare it with either. Football is decided by goals of all shapes and sizes but this was the most delicious of reminders that there is nothing in the sport quite like a pass.\n\nTo some extent we know that already. Manchester City have already made 2,483 passes in the Premier League this season. At the other end of the scale even Burnley, for all their belts and braces, have made 1,190. Any team that do not play a possession game risk at least some degree of stigmatisation nowadays; it is dogma to the extent that most passes, played from side to side as a team build from the back, barely register in the consciousness. Done badly, or by Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, the pass can quickly become a symbol of sterility.\n\nSky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) He sees things that other people don't! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n\nOutrageous vision and skill from Paul Scholes...\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/oju4gfh4O5\n\nWhat Scholes provided, then, was a reminder of the pass\u2019s simple allure; a glimpse of its boundless possibilities in opening doors that should be locked. There are two types of passer that command particular fascination: the player who looks two steps ahead and offers deliveries that practically scream instructions as to what the beneficiary should do next, and the player who can blow a football game\u2019s congested, chaotic resting state wide open with one devastating flourish. In his playing days Scholes was that rarity who could do both: give or take the odd screamer from range, it is largely why he was loved and it does not take an extensive search to find lengthy compilations of his crossfield deliveries executed while in a United shirt.\n\nAnd it is a reminder that the pass itself deserves something of a love letter. To score a goal, your most important work is directed towards a target measuring roughly 17.9 square metres. A passer, though, has the entire pitch at their disposal; a canvas on which to eke out spaces only they can imagine and turn the dimensions of a match on their head.\n\nThe best passes hold a pure, instinctive aesthetic appeal to the human sensibility; they defy what we think we know about lines, shapes and vectors while delivering none of the hurt doled out by a missed chance or fluffed final ball. That is why, in a widely shared clip of Andraz Sporar\u2019s clinically taken goal during Slovenia\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifying win over Poland last Friday, the buzz was all about the improbable outside-of-the-boot ball down the line from Josip Ilicic that created it. It is why you have forgotten most of the 97 goals scored by Rui Costa, the old Portuguese genius, during his career but have spent hour upon hour watching the readily available reels of his through balls. And it is why, among the tens of thousands of workaday passes completed throughout Europe\u2019s leagues this weekend, somebody, somewhere will try to emulate Scholes in conjuring the impossible.", "description": "The former Manchester United legend showed on Wednesday night why so many of us love a wonderfully executed pass", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d5fa612cfb1c22a103e6e1eb7c38d6acfdbfeb4/569_140_1259_755/master/1259.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45ca47e8514a62187ba725049827408f", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
