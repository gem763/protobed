Ali Karimli, leader of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan Party, was detained with scores of his supporters as they defied a ban to demonstrate in central Baku.\n\n\u201cSix to seven police officers handcuffed me, throwing me onto the floor and kicking me,\u201d Karimli said in a video statement on his Facebook page. With bruises visible on his head, face and neck, Karimli said he was beaten so severely that at some point he lost consciousness.\n\nWhile Azerbaijan ranks among the world\u2019s most corrupt and repressive governments, arrests or torture of leaders of opposition parties are rare in the energy-rich former Soviet republic.\n\nWith parliamentary elections looming next year, demonstrators gathered on Saturday despite a heavy security presence, demanding the resignation of the country\u2019s longtime President Ilham Aliyev. Karimli and other leaders of the secular opposition are using social media to galvanize public support for a peaceful shift to democracy.\n\nAuthorities had offered demonstrators a remote location on the outskirts of the city to conduct the rally.\n\nEurope\u2019s Warning\n\nThe EU\u2019s executive arm called for an investigation into reports of excessive and unprovoked force, urging the Azeri government to release the detained opposition protesters.\n\n\u201cFreedom of assembly is a fundamental human right and we expect Azerbaijan to ensure that it can be fully exercised, in line with the country\u2019s international obligations,\u201d European Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said in a statement.\n\nAfter being detained and dragged into a police car, Karimli was eventually taken to hospital where he received stitches to his forehead and his body was screened for injuries. He was later released home.\n\nThe Interior Ministry\u2019s press service didn\u2019t answer calls for comment. Sahlab Bagirov, commander of the riot police, on Saturday rejected claims police used excessive force.\n\nIn a statement late Saturday, the Interior Ministry said 60 people were detained for attending the demonstration. Of those, 42 were \u201cwarned\u201d and released. The remaining 18 will stand trial.\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Torrey Clark at tclark8@bloomberg.net, Paul Abelsky, Angela Cullen\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The political fallout of rare anti-government demonstrations is spreading in Azerbaijan, with the European Union issuing a warning and an opposition leader saying he was beaten up by riot police following his arrest on Saturday.An unathorized rally by hundreds of protesters demanding freedom", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cYgXm8C4b10alwScJdztFQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MTk5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ca4756639a50da19e81aad7b156ab5ac", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
