Not an ideal situation. As scenes of chaos ensure, Gemma is left terrified by the prospect of having to give birth mid-air.\n\nIdeally, with the risks of giving birth to quadruplets, Gemma would need to be in a hospital environment and a natural birth would generally be unlikely so fans may be left fearing that something will go wrong with the babies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t reveal the end outcome but given the spoilers which lie ahead \u2013 which include Gemma and Chesney considering the possibility of lucrative PR deals \u2013 we can possibly rule out a devastating tragedy.\n\nAs the stressful situation overwhelms the couple, can emergency services reach them?\n\nCoronation Street continues on Wednesday 30th October at 7:30pm and 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Corrie birth crisis!", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gemma-Winter-Coronation-Street-ee81_1572438812.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
