The seals would not be able to pup here at all without a reliable food source, so this demonstrates that the Thames ecosystem is thriving and shows just how far we have come since the river was declared biologically dead in the 1950s.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Scientists say the results indicate the river is providing seals with a reliable food source.\n\nThe survey has found numbers of seals in the Thames are on the rise, but it was not known whether the increase was due to resident seals having pups or adults arriving from other areas where colony numbers are falling.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Wildlife photographer of the year 1/25 A polar bear's struggle - Highly Commended Justin Hofman, USA. Justin\u2019s whole body pained as he watched this starving polar bear at an abandoned hunter's camp, in the Canadian Arctic, slowly heave itself up to standing. With little, and thinning, ice to move around on, the bear is unable to search for food. Justin Hofman / Natural History Museum 2/25 Curious Encounter - Shortlisted Cristobal Serrano, Spain. Any close encounter with an animal in the vast wilderness of Antarctica happens by chance, so Cristobal was thrilled by this spontaneous meeting with a crabeater seal off of Cuverville Island, Antarctic Peninsula. These curious creatures are protected and, with few predators, thrive. Cristobal Serrano / Natural History Museum 3/25 Bond of brothers - Winner David Lloyd, New Zealand / UK. These two adult males, probably brothers, greeted and rubbed faces for 30 seconds before settling down. Most people never have the opportunity to witness such animal sentience, and David was honoured to have experienced and captured such a moment.The picture was taken in Ndutu, Serengeti, Tanzania. David Lloyd / Natural History Museum 4/25 Fox meets fox - Highly Commended Matthew Maran, UK. Matthew has been photographing foxes close to his home in north London for over a year and ever since spotting this street art had dreamt of capturing this image. After countless hours and many failed attempts his persistence paid off. Matthew Maran / Natural History Museum 5/25 Three Kings - Highly Commended Wim Van Den Heever, South Africa. Wim came across these king penguins on a beach in the Falkland Islands just as the sun was rising. They were caught up in a fascinating mating behaviour \u2013the two males were constantly moving around the female using their flippers to fend the other off. Wim Van Den Heever / Natural History Museum 6/25 One toy, three dogs - Highly Commended Bence Mate, Hungary. While adult African wild dogs are merciless killers, their pups are extremely cute and play all day long. Bence photographed these brothers in Mkuze, South Africa \u2013they all wanted to play with the leg of an impala and were trying to drag it in three different directions! Bence Mate / Natural History Museum 7/25 Clam Close-up - Shortlisted David Barrio, Spain. This macro-shot of an iridescent clam was taken in the Southern Red Sea, Marsa Alam, Egypt. These clams spend their lives embedded amongst stony corals, where they nest and grow. It took David some time to approach the clam, fearing it would sense his movements and snap shut! David Barrio / Natural History Museum 8/25 The Orphaned Beaver - Shortlisted Suzi Eszterhas, United States. A one-month-old orphaned North American beaver kit is held by a caretaker at the Sarvey Wildlife Care Center in Arlington, Washington. Luckily it was paired with a female beaver who took on the role of mother and they were later released into the wild. Suzi Eszterhas / Natural History Museum 9/25 Ice and Water - Shortlisted Audun Lie Dahl, Norway. The Br\u00e5svellbreen glacier moves southwards from one of the ice caps covering the Svalbard Archipelago, Norway. Where it meets the sea, the glacier wall is so high that only the waterfalls are visible, so Audun used a drone to capture this unique perspective Audun Lie Dahl / Natural History Museum 10/25 Teenager - Shortlisted Franco Banfi, Switzerland. Franco was free diving off Dominica in the Caribbean Sea when he witnessed this young male sperm whale trying to copulate with a female. Unfortunately for him her calf was always in the way and the frisky male had to continually chase off the troublesome calf. Franco Banfi / Natural History Museum 11/25 Resting Mountain Gorilla - Shortlisted David Lloyd. The baby gorilla clung to its mother whilst keeping a curious eye on David. He had been trekking in South Bwindi, Uganda, whenhe came across the whole family. Following them, they then stopped in a small clearing to relax and groom each other. David Lloyd / Natural History Museum 12/25 Painted Waterfall - Shorltisted Eduardo Blanco Mendizabal, Spain. When the sun beams through a hole in the rock at the foot of the La Foradada waterfall, Catalonia, Spain, it creates a beautiful pool of light. The rays appear to paint the spray of the waterfall and create a truly magical picture. Eduardo Blanco Mendizabal / Natural History Museum 13/25 The Extraction - Shortlisted Konstantin Shatenev, Russia. Every winter, hundreds of Steller's sea eagles migrate from Russia, to the relatively ice-free northeastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan. They hunt for fish among the ices floes and also scavenge, following the fishing boats to feed on any discards. Konstantin took his image from a boat as the eagles retrieved a dead fish thrown onto the ice. Konstantin Shatenev / Natural History Museum 14/25 Shy - Shortlisted Pedro Carrillo, Spain. The mesmerizing pattern of a beaded sand anemone beautifully frames a juvenile Clarkii clownfish in Lembehstrait, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Known as a 'nursery' anemone, it is often a temporary home for young clownfish until they find a more suitable host anemone for adulthood. Pedro Carrillo / Natural History Museum 15/25 Red, Silver and Black - Shortlisted TinMan Lee, USA. Tin was fortunate enough to be told about a fox den in Washington State, North America, which was home to a family of red, black and silver foxes.

Snapped from a helicopter, this isolated tree stands in a cultivated field on the edge of a tropical forest on Kauai, Hawaii. The manmade straight lines of the ploughed furrows are interrupted beautifully by nature\u2019s more unruly wild pattern of tree branches. Anna Henly / Natural History Museum 17/25 Sound Asleep - Shortlisted Tony Wu, USA. This adult humpback whale balanced in mid-water, headon and sound asleep was photographed in Vava\u2019u, Kingdom of Tonga. The faint stream of bubbles, visible at the top, is coming from the whale\u2019s two blowholes and was, in this instance, indicative of an extremely relaxed state. Tony Wu / Natural History Museum 18/25 All That Remains - Shortlisted Phil Jones, UK. A male orca had beached itself about a week before Phil\u2019s visit to Sea Lion Island, Falkland Islands. Despite its huge size the shifting sands had almost covered the whole carcass and scavengers, such as this striated caracara, had started to move in. Phil Jones / Natural History Museum 19/25 Ambush - Shortlisted Federico Veronesi, Kenya. On a hot morning at the Chitake Springs, in Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe, Federico watched as an old lioness descended from the top of the riverbank. She\u2019d been lying in wait to ambush any passing animals visiting a nearby waterhole further along the riverbed. Federico Veronesi / Natural History Museum 20/25 Gliding - Shortlisted Christian Vizl, Mexico. With conditions of perfect visibility and beautiful sunlight, Christian took this portrait of a nurse shark gliding through the ocean off the coast of Bimini in the Bahamas. Typically these sharks are found near sandy bottoms where they rest, so it\u2019s rare to see them swimming. Christian Vizl / Natural History Museum 21/25 Otherworldly - Shortlisted Franco Banfi, Switzerland. A school of Munk's devil ray were feeding on plankton at night off the coast of Isla Esp\u00edritu Santo in Baja California, Mexico.

This is an easier way of counting seals than in real life when they are constantly on the move, the experts said.\n\nThe Thames is home to both harbour seals and grey seals, but only harbour seals breed there.\n\nProject manager Anna Cucknell, who leads ZSL\u2019s Thames conservation, explained: \u201cThe restored Mother Thames \u2013 as we call her \u2013 is an essential nursery habitat and home to many animals, including more than 100 species of fish, including two species of shark, short-snouted seahorses and the critically endangered European eel.\n\n\u201cIncredibly, harbour seal pups can swim within hours of birth, which means they are well adapted to grow up in tidal estuaries like the Thames.\n\n\u201cBy the time the tide comes in, they can swim away on it.\n\n\u201cGrey seals, on the other hand, take longer to be comfortable in the water, so breed elsewhere and come to the Thames later to feed.\u201d\n\nThe aim is for the population survey and the breeding survey to complement each other and give researchers at ZSL a better understanding of the seals in the Thames and the reason behind their changing numbers, the experts said.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "In the 1950s the Thames was declared \u201cbiologically dead\u201d but now \u2013 more than 60 years later \u2013 an estimated 138 harbour seals were born on the river\u2019s shores last year.\u00a0 In the first survey of its kind\u00a0researchers from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) counted seals born in the river by analysing hundreds of photos taken from a\u00a0light aircraft during last year\u2019s pupping", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/12/harbour-seal-and-pup-credit-graham-mee-se-rspb-1.jpg"}
