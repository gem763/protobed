The company posted earnings per share of 17 cents, falling short of the 20 cents that was expected by Wall Street analysts. Revenue for the period was $823.7 million, versus the $874 million expected.\n\nFor the third quarter, \u201cwe discovered, and took steps to remediate bugs that primarily affected our legacy Mobile Application Promotion (MAP) product, impacting our ability to target ads and share data with measurement and ad partners,\u201d Twitter said in its letter to shareholders.\n\n\u201cWe also experienced greater-than-expected seasonality in our advertising business that began in July and continued into August.\u201d\n\nTwitter said these issues negatively impacted year-over-year revenue growth for the period.\n\nAdvertising revenue hit $702 million for the third quarter, which was up from the same period last year, but also failed to match analyst expectations.\n\nTwitter also published fourth-quarter guidance that fell short of expectations. The company is forecasting total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion for the period, which is below the $1.06 billion that Wall Street is expecting.\n\nIn recent weeks, Twitter has found itself in the middle of a Democratic skirmish over whether President Donald Trump should be banned from the platform.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has called on Twitter to give President Trump the boot, claiming that he incites \u201cfear\u201d and that he made comments about the so-called White House \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d\n\nBut rival candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) have both said President Trump should be allowed to remain on Twitter.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
