There are financial implications, too. People whose internal clocks align better with the demands of the social clock earn 4-5% more on average than evening-type people. The reason, it seems, is morning types are alert and ready to be productive in the morning. Late types, however, aren't as likely to do their best work so early in the day, meaning typical business hours give morning types an advantage.\n\nThere are other unexpected dividends from matching sleep clocks and daily life: when school start times were delayed by about an hour and a half in one county in the US state of Virginia, teenagers (who tend to sleep longer and later than everyone else) were involved in fewer weekday car accidents when compared to a nearby school with similar traffic patterns. Researchers believe the additional sleep time helped reduce crashes among teenage drivers.\n\nThere's also a health impact. \"Misalignment leads to a lot of chronic diseases,\" says Roenneberg, citing metabolic syndrome as an example. People who suffer from social jet lag are more likely to be smokers and if they are already overweight, more likely to become obese. Synchronising people\u2019s lives with their internal sleep clocks is important \u201cbecause it will make people healthier, live longer and will reduce costs for society\".\n\nWhat can workplaces do?\n\nBut aligning the social clock with the internal clock is, sadly, not often up to us; it depends on the organisations we work for. \"Society does a very schizophrenic thing at the moment,\" Roenneberg says. \"On the one hand, it wants to be a 24/7 society that acts globally. On the other hand, it still thinks that someone who appears at work at 10:00 is lazy.\"\n\nHe believes companies would benefit from adjusting start times to individual employee needs. \u201cIf you have slept in your own window and you've woken up by yourself, you'll be much more productive,\" he says. \"There's an enormous incentive to make people not use alarm clocks if you want them to perform better and get sick less often.\"", "description": "Work, school and life in general tend to start early in the day \u2013 but what if your body clock didn\u2019t get the memo?
