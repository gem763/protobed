Biden at his parish on Sunday because of the Democratic presidential contender\u2019s support for abortion.\n\nThe Rev. Robert E. Morey told the Florence Morning News on Monday that he had refused one of the Catholic Church\u2019s sacraments to Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Father Morey, pastor at St. Anthony Catholic Church in Florence, told the Morning News via email. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden says he is \u201cpersonally opposed\u201d to abortion, but insists that this should not affect political stances.\n\nSince declaring his 2020 presidential candidacy, Mr. Biden has said he supports codifying the right to abortion into federal law even if the Supreme Court reverses itself on the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. He also has flip-flopped on his longtime support for the Hyde Amendment, which bars taxpayer funding for the procedure, which the Catholic Church condemns as murder. Mr. Biden said in June that public money should pay for abortions.\n\nThe Biden campaign would not confirm to the Florence Morning News that Mr. Biden had attended St. Anthony, but \u201csaid if he did attend he did so in a private capacity,\u201d the Morning News wrote.\n\nThe spokesperson \u201cdirected the conversation to a public appearance at 11 a.m. Sunday at Jerusalem Baptist Church in Hartsville,\u201d the paper wrote.\n\nFather Morey\u2019s email said the handling of pro-choice Catholic politicians is a difficult situation, but it is his responsibility to minister to souls.\n\n\u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
