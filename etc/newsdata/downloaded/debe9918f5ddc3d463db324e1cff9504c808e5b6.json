It\u2019s not only one game and the second game the focus and intensity start to drop.\n\n\u201cThat is the key in our team, not only him but all the players.\n\n\u201cAll the players need to be consistent and understand that every time we are going to compete we have to give our best.\n\n\u201cGive like a collective our best and for sure we have the quality to beat any team.\u201d\n\nAurier is in a fight with Kyle Walker-Peters and Juan Foyth for the right-back position, not that he believes that himself according to a recent interview in France.\n\nHe claimed that there was \u201cno competition\u201d for his place in the team, but Pochettino has not seen it.\n\n\u201cI did not see those quotes,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see but you know, if when I talk with him it\u2019s always clear. I didn\u2019t see though.\u201d\n\nAurier played his part in a Spurs romp, which saw Son Heung-min score twice, Patrick van Aanholt put through his own net and Erik Lamela cap off a scintillating first-half performance.\n\nPalace skipper Luka Milivojevic offered no excuses.\n\n\u201cIt was a very tough day for us,\u201d he said on the club\u2019s official website.\n\n\u201cI have no good explanation at the moment straight after the game.\n\n\u201cBut you could see in the first 20 or 30 minutes they were better than us.\n\n\u201cWhen they scored the first, second or third you try to correct some things but the game is going \u2013 it\u2019s not easy.\n\n\u201cAt half-time we tried to stick together, to go for the second half, to try to play better, to improve a bit more and in the end they deserved three points.
