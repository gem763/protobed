Roma usually refers to those that settled in Europe.\n\nIrish Travellers - sometimes known as Pavee - and Scottish Travellers are descended from nomadic people in Ireland and Britain.\n\nRomany Gypsies and Scottish, Welsh and Irish Travellers are all ethnic minorities, recognised under UK law and the Irish government.\n\nThere is also a cross-party parliamentary group called the All Party Parliamentary Group for Gypsies, Roma and Travellers, which focuses on the communities.\n\nAll the different Gypsy, Roma and Traveller groups in the UK have a shared language or dialect and some shared cultural practices.\n\n(Image: Cambridge News WS)\n\nIn the 2011 Census, 58,000 people identified themselves as Gypsy or Irish Traveller, accounting for just 0.1 per cent of the population of England and Wales. However, the figure is likely to be much higher.\n\nGovernment figures suggest as much as five per cent of the Gypsy and Traveller population is in prison, compared to 0.13 per cent of the general UK population.\n\nThe number of Gypsy and Traveller caravans in England and Wales is recorded twice a year.\n\nThe vast majority living in caravans stay of permanent public and private sites which have planning permission and waste collection, and are subject to rent, council tax and utility bills.\n\n(Image: Cambridge News WS)\n\nA small proportion of Gypsy and Traveller caravans are classed as unauthorised and staying on land they do not own, such as roadside camps.\n\nThis includes those with no other place to stay, as well as Gypsies and Travellers who move off authorised sites to go 'travelling' during the summer.\n\nHowever, not all Gypsies and Travellers 'travel', and many only do so to attend traditional cultural events like Appleby Horse Fair in Cumbria.\n\nThe community has faced discrimination and prejudice.\n\nIn some European countries, Roma are segregated from the rest of the population.\n\nHistorians estimate that around 500,000 Roma were murdered by the Nazi's during the Second World War, although some have put this figure closer to one million.", "description": "The Travellers' Times website has created a guide to understanding the community", "authors": ["Anna Savva", "Image", "Cambridge News Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735301.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Travellers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
