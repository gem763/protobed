So far, five central banks have interest rates set below zero, including Japan, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and the European Central Bank.\n\nA recession could theoretically prompt the Fed to eventually send rates -- which have remained historically low in the aftermath of the 2007 recession -- into negative territory as they gradually trim over the next few years.\n\nHowever, Chair Jerome Powell recently dismissed the idea that the U.S. central bank will one day use negative interest rates to combat an economic downturn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we didn\u2019t see as an ideal tool in our institutional context,\u201d he said during a question-and-answer session in Denver.\n\n\u201cI think different central banks around the world did different things, and we can observe how those things work,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we regard that as a first-order tool, or something we\u2019d be likely to use.\u201d\n\nSo far this year, policymakers at the U.S. central bank have voted to cut the benchmark federal funds rate twice between a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent. They're widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points for the third time during their upcoming meeting at the end of October.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "A recession could theoretically prompt the Fed to eventually send rates into negative territory.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/Fed-Powell-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
