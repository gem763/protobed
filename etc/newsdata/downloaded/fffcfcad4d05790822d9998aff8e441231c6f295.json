(iStock/iStock)\n\nHe was an unknown former U.S. Army repairman of attack helicopters when he arrived in the Philippines in 2001, where he would run websites featuring Japanese pornography, tend to a pig farm and pursue his interests in yoga and fountain pens.\n\nJim Watkins also would become the face of one of the Web\u2019s most notorious sites, 8chan, defending the anonymous message board as a beacon of free speech even as it became a platform for announcing and celebrating mass murder.\n\nSubpoenaed by the House Homeland Security Committee, Watkins, now 55, came to Washington last week for closed-door questioning by congressional staff on the site that before its recent collapse had styled itself \u201cthe darkest reaches of the Internet.\u201d\n\nBut 8chan was only the most infamous of Watkins\u2019s strange and tangled business web, which expanded for years from a shabby Manila office to millions of computers around the world \u2014 fueled by the strange chemistry of the Internet, where virtually anyone can turn a few servers into an online kingdom with its own culture, followers and code.\n\nWatkins\u2019s path from a porn merchant to the keeper of what one former ally called a \u201ccesspool of hate\u201d appears to have grown out of his desire to capitalize on the seedier corners of the Internet, hopping between dot-com trends and positioning himself as an eccentric luminary in the communities he helped cultivate.\n\nBut the rise of 8chan also shows how online subcultures can expand far beyond their owners into toxic movements with devastating real-world impact. The site\u2019s longtime rallying cry at the top of its homepage was a simple one: \u201cEmbrace infamy.\u201d\n\nWatkins has portrayed himself as a champion of First Amendment freedoms. In his prepared statement for congressional staff, he described 8chan as \u201cthe only platform featuring a full commitment to free speech\u201d: a \u201chodgepodge of chaotic discussion\u201d and \u201cone-of-a-kind discussion board\u201d where \u201cdown-home recipes are traded (and) sorrows lifted.\u201d\n\nWatkins\u2019s prepared remarks, released publicly last week, echoed many of the arguments he offered after 8chan was used to announce the murders of a total of 74 people this year in shootings at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand; a synagogue in Poway, Calif.; and a Walmart in El Paso. Some 8chan users lionized the killers in all three cases afterward. \u201cA small minority of users post hateful and ignorant items,\u201d Watkins said.\n\n\u201cOur company has built and maintained a digital forum that is the place where opposing viewpoints and those of minorities such as the LGBTQ may express themselves free from the fear of their life,\u201d Watkins said in his statement \u2014 one vastly at odds with the hate speech rampant on the site. That 8chan is now offline, Watkins added, meant its users had been \u201csilenced\u201d and \u201clost their last bastion of free speech.\u201d\n\nNo transcript was released of Watkins\u2019s back-and-forth with committee staff, but the committee\u2019s leaders, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and Rep. Mike D. Rogers (R-Ala.), released a statement thanking Watkins for providing \u201cvast and helpful information\u201d about his companies and said they looked forward to \u201chis continued cooperation.\"\n\n[Three mass shootings this year began with a hateful screed on 8chan. Its founder calls it a terrorist refuge in plain sight.]\n\nWatkins has condemned the mass shootings as being done by \u201cthe worst sort of monster.\u201d After the Christchurch shooting in March, Watkins posted a video saying \u201cgoing postal is such a sad thing\u201d and blaming the massacre on a noncitizen \u201calien in New Zealand.\u201d \u201cAmerica too has had awful gun violence committed by aliens,\u201d Watkins added.\n\nHe has also called 8chan merely a \u201ctool\u201d and said the site has \u201cresponded with both vigor and integrity\u201d to remove violent threats. The companies that had terminated service to 8chan, forcing it to shut down, he said, were exhibiting \u201csinister behavior\u201d to disperse \u201ca peacefully assembled group of people talking.\"\n\nRecorded in front of a silhouette of Benjamin Franklin, Watkins last month called 8chan one of the last online safe spaces where \u201cyou may write down your thoughts, free from having to worry about whether they are offensive to one group or another.\u201d\n\nWhile Watkins has contended there was little he could do to rein in the anonymous user base, 8chan often has appeared to encourage the hateful chatter on its site. Its official rules, for instance, included special formatting codes: three parentheses were used in anti-Semitic messages to point to someone\u2019s presumed Jewish background \u2014 \u201cto call (((them))) out,\u201d as the rules stated \u2014 while a single less-than symbol was used to turn text pink, highlighting what the message board called \u201cfaggotposting.\"\n\nThe site\u2019s only rule limiting content: nothing that is illegal in the United States. Everything else was fair game. In his prepared testimony, Watkins said his \u201ccompany has no intention of deleting constitutionally protected hate speech.\u201d\n\nThat leniency helped Watkins\u2019s site become a fortress for anonymous racism, sexism, anti-Semitism and extremism, as posters cheered on mass shootings, canonized the gunmen and shared their screeds and bloody live-streamed videos. \u201cI\u2019ve only been lurking here for a year and half, yet what I\u2019ve learned here is priceless,\u201d the alleged Poway gunman wrote on 8chan before his attack, which killed one and injured three.\n\nThe site had hundreds of forums or boards devoted to topics such as video games, porn, guns and anime. But its most active and infamous board \u2014 known as \u201c/pol/,\u201d for \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d \u2014 was devoted almost entirely to conspiracy theories, white supremacy, trolling of the mainstream Internet and attacks on racial minorities, Jews, Muslims, liberals and women, among many others. Before going offline, the site had an average of 1.7 million unique visitors every month this year, a 17 percent jump over 2018, according to the website-analysis firm SimilarWeb.\n\nWatkins last week was photographed on Capitol Hill with a scruffy mustache, mutton-chop sideburns and a flag pin on his tie of Mississippi, the home state of Thompson, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, who had subpoenaed him. He wore another pin on his collar of the letter Q, probably a reference to the 8chan-rooted fringe conspiracy theory QAnon, which claims that President Trump is secretly working to disrupt a sprawling cabal of world-dominating pedophiles.\n\n[8chan looks like a terrorist recruiting site after the New Zealand shootings. Should the government treat it like one?]\n\nWatkins has for months declined to be interviewed, answering lists of questions about the site\u2019s violent threats and white-supremacist content with pat responses such as, \u201cHave a wonderful day.\u201d But on the Friday afternoon after his congressional testimony, he called a Washington Post reporter while he said he was \u201crunning errands\u201d around Washington, which appeared to include sitting for a studio interview on the conservative media outlet One America News.\n\nWatkins told The Post that he was questioned for four hours by congressional staff, that they had treated him \u201cvery fine,\u201d and that he expected to be called back again. He said the site would assist with law-enforcement requests but would not ban what he called \u201cconstitutionally protected hate speech.\u201d\n\nThe fate of 8chan, he said, is \u201cthe biggest test for freedom of speech since maybe 1969.\u201d\n\nWatkins complained that past news stories had made him \u201cout to be a bit of a nut cake,\u201d and he said he was seriously considering moving to Thompson\u2019s district in Mississippi and running 8chan from there because the housing prices were so low. He insisted he was not joking: \u201cThe whole state is like a park.\u201d\n\nHe said 8chan workers \u2014 led by the site\u2019s administrator, his son Ron Watkins \u2014 were building a protective network to guard against the service-denying cyberattacks that some people expect vigilante hackers will unleash if the site attempts a return. That network, he said, would serve as a replacement for Cloudflare, the company that had helped shield the site until last month, when its chief executive terminated service for what he called 8chan\u2019s \u201clawless \u2026 cesspool of hate.\u201d\n\nAsked about the site\u2019s long-running slogan, \u201cEmbrace infamy,\u201d Watkins said, \u201cThe newspapers say we\u2019re infamous, so we have embraced infamy.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s cute, and it\u2019s appropriate.\"\n\nBut he appeared to grow upset minutes into the call, responding to one question by saying, \u201cF--- off,\u201d which he later claimed he had intended for his Uber driver. After being asked whether an 8chan advertising program this year called \u201cKing of the Shekel\u201d was anti-Semitic, Watkins hung up. Through his longtime business partner Tom Riedel, Watkins declined to answer later calls.\n\nLaunched in 2013 as an anything-goes spinoff of the message board 4chan, 8chan had quickly seen its popularity explode, and its founder, Fredrick Brennan, was straining to handle the site\u2019s growing server costs and time demands. When Watkins and his son offered to provide the financial wherewithal to keep the site online, Brennan agreed almost immediately, moving to Manila in 2014 to join Watkins\u2019s eccentric tribe.\n\nBut Brennan, who split with Watkins last year following a long period of dysfunction and anger over the site\u2019s direction, now pans the site as a long-lost cause, saying Watkins is severely unqualified to oversee the noxious platform he helped create. \u201c8chan should never come back online,\u201d Brennan said. Of Watkins\u2019s latest comments, Brennan said it\u2019s \u201cmore shady behavior from a man who thrives in the shade.\u201d\n\n[8chan vowed to fight on, saying its \u2018heartbeat is strong.\u2019 Then a tech firm knocked it offline.]\n\nWatkins is also facing scrutiny from two law enforcement bodies in the Philippines, where he is petitioning to become a naturalized citizen. The Philippine National Police launched a formal and ongoing investigation into the site last month, police spokesman Bernard Banac said. A spokesman from the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation said the group\u2019s cybercrime division is also investigating the site but declined to comment further.\n\nFor his congressional visit, Watkins retained Benjamin Barr, a Chicago lawyer whose website says he was the \u201clead architect\u201d for \u201cundercover operations\u201d at Project Veritas, a group that attempts \u201cstings\u201d on journalists, tech companies and liberal advocacy groups. The group tried and failed to fool Washington Post journalists into reporting false claims that Roy Moore, then a Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, had impregnated a woman when she was a teenager.\n\nWatkins said his son and other 8chan workers were aiming to bring the site back online as early as this week. Ron Watkins has also publicly suggested in recent days that he had given \u201cserious thought\u201d to launching a communications satellite that could help beam 8chan around the world. \u201cNot an expert on space law, but seems like such a setup would have absolutely no jurisdiction and be uncensorable,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBut the site faces heavy resistance from many of the Internet\u2019s hidden gatekeepers, including website hosts and critical security firms that have pledged never to work with the site again. Some users also say they\u2019ve led an online exodus to other 8chan-style bunkers, potentially limiting its future reach.\n\nTwo of the three companies Jim Watkins named in his prepared statement as having ongoing contracts with his business \u2014 the domain name registrar Tucows and website host Epik \u2014 have publicly abandoned 8chan, citing \u201cinadequate enforcement and the elevated possibility of violent radicalization,\u201d as Epik\u2019s chief said last month. (The third company Watkins mentioned, the American Registry for Internet Numbers, functions like an open Internet phone book and works with practically everyone.)\n\nRaised on a family farm in Washington state, Watkins\u2019s first real education in computers came through his work in the U.S. Army, which sent him to a tech-focused school in Virginia, he said in a 2016 interview with the website Splinter. Watkins served in the U.S. Army from 1982 to 1999: a sergeant first class, recruiter and repairman of attack helicopters, a Pentagon spokesperson said.\n\nTwo years after he left the service, he took steps to begin a new life in Manila, arriving in October 2001 and marrying his wife, Liezel, there three weeks later, according to a paid court notice related to Watkins\u2019s naturalization petition published in February in the Manila Times newspaper. Watkins told The Post he began moving in earnest to the country in 2004, and began living there full-time in 2007. Watkins\u2019s business partner Riedel later disputed the court notice as \u201cincorrect\u201d but did not provide details.\n\n[Will taking down 8chan stop the worst people on the Internet?]\n\nWatkins had for years built a business in the lurid expanses of the Internet. In the 1990s, while still in the military, he had launched a now-defunct Japanese porn site, Asian Bikini Bar, that he claimed in a 2015 video had once been \u201cone of the largest video streaming adult websites in the world.\u201d The site prospered by circumventing strict Japanese rules for censoring porn by hosting the content in the United States, Riedel said in 2016.\n\nBut its name, Watkins said in 2015, \u201cdidn\u2019t go over well with the wives\u201d who saw it in credit-card statements, so he renamed the enterprise N.T. Technology. (The acronym, he said, means nothing.) The Reno, Nev.-based company is now tied to many of Watkins\u2019s other Web properties worldwide, business records show. Those include a smattering of Manila-based companies focused on computer services and real-world property over the years, including a now-closed organic food company and, in 2005, a business called Race Queen, probably named for the scantily clad models who pose along the tracks of Japanese car races.\n\nLocated in a dilapidated Manila office tower, Race Queen calls itself a \u201csoftware development and outsourcing company,\u201d according to a torn sign taped to the door. It has also been listed as an employer on work visas for foreign employees of 8chan and Watkins\u2019s other message boards, including Brennan, Philippines immigration records show.\n\nAnother Watkins business run from Manila, Loki Technology, owns the popular Japanese message board 5channel. Key positions at the company, like most of his operations, are held by a small group of relatives and close acquaintances. The company\u2019s treasurer and largest shareholder is Watkins\u2019s wife, the company\u2019s latest financial disclosures state.\n\nThe naturalization court notice said Watkins and his wife had bought several properties across the country, including a condo in metro Manila and farms outside the city, where he said he raised pigs. Philippine business records reveal glimpses of a peculiar assortment of businesses in Watkins\u2019s orbit: The company Emerald Pedistal, which lists ownership in Manila condo units and calls Watkins \u201cchairman of the board,\u201d said it had spent about 734,000 Philippine pesos, or about $14,000, on wages and received about $3,600 for the sale of piglets in 2017.\n\nWatkins has said repeatedly he makes no money from running 8chan, and Brennan has claimed that the site\u2019s content has made it repellent to advertisers, limiting its mainstream reach. Watkins told One America News last week that 8chan had earned about $12,000 a year in gross revenue and that the recent decision by some companies to stop working with 8chan was \u201ccommercial terrorism.\u201d\n\n[Congress subpoenas 8chan owner to testify about mass shootings, online hate]\n\nThe company\u2019s recent attempts at turning a profit from its audience have shown unclear results: After the Christchurch shooting, the site started offering viewers the ability to pay to have their 8chan threads get top billing on the site through its \u201cKing of the Shekel\u201d program. Payments were solicited through a cryptocurrency developed by Ron Watkins and run through a company based in Japan.\n\nJim Watkins, however, has sought to bring in money in other ways, including through a book-narration company, books.audio. Many of the narrators \u2014 who have provided English-language voicing for books on the Mediterranean diet and how to \u201cuse your body fluids in magic ritual\u201d \u2014 are people who have worked with Watkins on other ventures, and almost all of them appear to work under pseudonyms. (For some of the titles he narrated, Watkins used the name \u201cA.J.\u201d)\n\nIn 2017, Watkins also ventured into the news business, looking for a way to capitalize on 8chan\u2019s user base. He founded the Goldwater, a self-styled news organization that operated under the slogan, \u201cBanned, biased, honest.\u201d The site\u2019s content was notably conspiratorial and amateurish, and Watkins appeared on screen in the site\u2019s early videos under the name Jim Cherney.\n\nBut two of the outlet\u2019s journalists, reporter Philip Fairbanks and editor in chief Kevin Lauf, who used the name Major Burdock on the site, were nevertheless able to obtain press credentials and attend the 2018 summit in Singapore between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The site is now \u201con hiatus,\u201d according to a post from May. Neither Fairbanks nor Lauf responded to requests for comment.\n\nWatkins\u2019s online history traces a sporadic path across his message boards. But on YouTube, he goes by \u201cWatkins Xerxes,\u201d using the name of the fabled king of the Persian empire (and the main villain of the action flick \u201c300\u2033). His videos often include himself doing yoga, reading books such as \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d and testing out new fountain pens.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a great day when you have a brand new Marlen pen,\u201d he said in one March video, during which he wears a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and tests out a \u201cbeautiful\u201d new Marlen Odysseus. \u201cYou know, I have dropped three expensive pens on the nib. And it just makes you cry when it happens.\u201d\n\nAfter the El Paso shooting, he also used his channel to speak directly to followers, urging them to weather the negative publicity of the mass shootings. In one video he stated, \u201cSorry for the inconvenience, common sense will prevail.\u201d\n\nMcLaughlin reported from Manila.
