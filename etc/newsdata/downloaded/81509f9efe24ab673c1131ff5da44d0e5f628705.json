The Marshall Islands has also been removed from that list, which still includes nine extra-EU jurisdictions - mostly Pacific islands with little financial relation with the EU.\n\nMajor economic partner Switzerland was removed from the gray list covering countries that have committed to change their tax rules to make them compliant with EU standards.
