She\u2019s also lending her skills as a singer and songwriter. The Daily Mail reported today that Swift and Andrew Lloyd Webber have collaborated on a new song for the Jellicle spectacular called \u201cBeautiful Ghosts,\u201dwhich will first be performed by Frankie Hayward and then reprised by Judi Dench, before Swift sings it over the credits. So it\u2019s not for Swift\u2019s character, Bombalurina, but it will come around to her in the end. Cats is of course the cinematic event of the coming holiday season. It\u2019s directed by Tom Hooper and stars Idris Elba, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, and Jennifer Hudson, among others, and also features cats with strangely human anatomy. No one is ready, but the movie will arrive on December 20 regardless.\n\nAnd if you\u2019d like to see a behind the scenes featurette on how Webber and Swift made the new song, here is yet another deeply sincere BTS video from the production.", "description": "Andrew Lloyd Webber and Taylor Swift have collaborated on a new song for the movie Cats, called \u201cBeautiful Ghosts\u201d, that will be sung by Frankie Hayward, but also by Judi Dench.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/24/24-taylor-swift.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
