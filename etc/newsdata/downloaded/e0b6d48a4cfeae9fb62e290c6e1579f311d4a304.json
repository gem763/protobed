It\u2019s magic.\u201d\n\nThe crooner\u2019s 1942 Decca version of White Christmas is the world\u2019s best-selling single, with 50 million sales and 1.8 billion online streams.\n\nBut it has never reached No1 in the UK charts and the Crosby family are said to be hopeful that will change this year.\n\nBing at Christmas also has new arrangements of Winter Wonderland, It\u2019s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas, and Little Drummer Boy.\n\nHe recorded the latter with David Bowie just a month before he died in 1977.\n\nDespite its ageless charm, Bing's track has tough competition for Christmas No1 from Robbie Williams and George Michael this year.", "description": "The classic 1942 festive track could reign supreme this year, 40 years after Crosby died in 1977", "authors": ["Tom Bryant"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572056.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Crosby-Family-copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
