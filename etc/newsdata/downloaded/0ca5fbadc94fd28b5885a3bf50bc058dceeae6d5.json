The Resulting Book Is Unsettling and Timely", "language": "en", "text": "For all the light that #metoo has shined into dark corners, many among us still swallow the destructive myth that most rapists are armed strangers lurking in alleys. The past two years have seen countless powerful examples of the truth: rapists are usually someone the victim knows, often quite well. But the stranger-danger emphasis that remains creates a shield, allowing perpetrators to avoid seeing themselves as doing real harm.\n\nJeannie Vanasco, an English professor and a survivor, wanted to delve into the motivations and behavior of rapists. In her new memoir, Things We Didn\u2019t Talk About When I Was a Girl, she asks a question central to our national conversation about abuse: \u201cIs it possible to be a good person who commits a terrible act?\u201d Vanasco\u2019s 2017 debut memoir, The Glass Eye, explored grief and mental illness. Her father died when she was in her first year of college, a devastating blow that was compounded by several traumatic incidents.\n\nThings We Didn\u2019t Talk About zeroes in on one: being raped by a close friend when she was 19 years old. More than a decade after the attack, Vanasco decided to look for her rapist and see if he would speak to her about what happened. The idea of such a confrontation is bold, unsettling and timely. She wanted to find out how a person who hurts others talks to himself about his actions. If we are ever going to reduce sexual violence, it\u2019s a critically important question.\n\nVanasco begins the book with meandering discussions of memory and writing as she describes her search for the man she hasn\u2019t spoken to in 14 years. But the tension accelerates and the structure tightens when she finds \u201cMark,\u201d and he agrees to several recorded conversations. The author intersperses transcripts of those conversations with her analysis of them\u2013a close read of shame, heartbreak and anger. \u201cI\u2019m tired of white, educated, middle-class guys, like Mark, not being held accountable,\u201d Vanasco writes. At the same time, she retraces the patterns of self-doubt so many survivors battle. \u201cDoes my silence make me complicit? I think it does. Or maybe I\u2019m finding another way to blame myself.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But they provide a vital examination of a kind of reflexive niceness, familiar to many women, which can create a feeling of safety by deflecting conflict, while also inhibiting accountability and growth.\n\nVanasco opens her process of self-examination to the reader. Along with questioning Mark, she explores her own responses, first to the attack, then to the interviews. She unpacks her struggle to describe what happened as rape and how the FBI\u2019s definition, updated in 2013 to be more nuanced, helped her accept the crime for what it was.\n\nMark\u2019s own process is murkier: while he admits in the book that he raped Vanasco, he struggles to see himself as a rapist. His apologies alternate between sincerity and infuriating self-interest. His comment\u2013\u201cNice guys are a total lie\u201d\u2013took my breath away. There are honorable men in the world; his own failure doesn\u2019t apply to all. But Vanasco writes with a fair hand. Mark\u2019s depression and solitude add a reluctant pathos to the book.\n\nWhat Vanasco\u2019s memoir lacks in research-oriented context, it makes up for in honesty. She has created a reckoning with injustice told in real time, with all the hesitations and concerns of a wounded heart. She provides few answers but compels readers to ask as we all move forward: How many abusers would act if they knew they\u2019d be called to account, not only legally, but also morally?\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.\n\nThis appears in the October 07, 2019 issue of TIME.", "description": "Jeannie Vanasco delves into the motivations and behavior of rapists in her new memoir, 'Things We Didn\u2019t Talk About When I Was a Girl.'", "authors": ["Laurie Halse Anderson"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/things-we-didne28099t-talk-about-when-i-was-a-girl-review-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
