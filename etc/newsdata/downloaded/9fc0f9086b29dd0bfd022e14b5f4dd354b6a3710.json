Why would you do that?\u2019 Simms told Wilson, according to transcripts of the encounter obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nDog walker, 68, 'smashed young boy's face into ground after being hit by snowball'\n\nWilson responded: \u2018I don\u2019t know. It looked like it had stuff in there.\u2019\n\nEven though Simms repeatedly said that she did not have drugs or other contraband, Wilson continued to search her.\n\nWilson then told Simms to turn around and spread her legs again, the suit alleges.\n\nWilson reportedly did not have a warrant to search Simms at the time of the incident (Picture: AP)\n\n\u2018Officer Wilson had violated Natalie vaginally, and now it appeared that she might violate Natalie anally. She was doing so without a warrant, with no medical personnel present, and on a public street in view of several people as well as those passing by,\u2019 Simms\u2019 lawyers wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the search, Simms continued to ask if she could be taken to a police station so the search could be conducted in private.\n\nCop 'sodomized woman after inviting her and her wife into his hot tub'\n\nWilson told Simms: \u2018If you don\u2019t have nothing, you don\u2019t have anything to worry about, okay, but these are all the places that everybody hides stuff, so this is where we have to search.\u2019\n\nThe complaint says Simms was eventually able to leave in her own car after officers did not find anything illegal. It does not say whether Wilson conducted an anal search.\n\nAfter Simms filed her lawsuit, the city of San Antonio offered her a $205,000 settlement. The city council is expected to approve on the payment on Thursday.\n\nWilson retired nine months after the incident with Simms.", "description": "Natalie Simms filed a lawsuit against the city of San Antonio, Texas and former Detective Mara Wilson, who reportedly removed Simms's tampon.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1571241449_1571254325.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
