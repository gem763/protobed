Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who lost his re-election bid in November 2018.\n\nSessions, who has been weighing a comeback, is not accused of any wrongdoing and denied Thursday that he was aware of what federal prosecutors allege was a coordinated effort to remove Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Still, he now finds himself entangled in the impeachment investigation centered on President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, as well as Giuliani\u2019s relationships in the former Soviet republic.\n\nThe indictment was made public Thursday following the arrest of two Florida businessmen with ties to Giuliani. It alleges that Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman leveraged a flurry of GOP political donations in a campaign to force Yovanovitch\u2019s removal, an effort prosecutors say was aided by laundered foreign money.\n\nParnas and Fruman\u2019s outsized political giving allowed the two relatively unknown entrepreneurs to quickly win access to the highest levels of the Republican Party \u2014 including face-to-face meetings with Trump at the White House and Mar-a-Lago.\n\nOn May 9, 2018, Parnas posted a photo of himself and his business partner David Correia with Sessions in his Capitol Hill office, with the caption \u201cHard at work !!\u201d\n\nCorreia, and another man, a Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen named Andrew Kukushkin, are also charged in the case.\n\nLater that same day, Sessions sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seeking Yovanovitch\u2019s dismissal because he had \u201cnotice of concrete evidence\u201d that she had \u201cspoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current Administration.\u201d\n\nCampaign finance records show Parnas and Fruman later contributed $2,700 apiece to Session\u2019s campaign, the maximum allowed individual contribution.\n\nSessions said Thursday that he will vigorously defend himself against any allegations of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI was first approached by these individuals for a meeting about the strategic need for Ukraine to become energy independent,\u201d Sessions said, according to a written statement. \u201cThere was no request in that meeting and I took no action.\u201d\n\nSessions added that \u201cseveral congressional colleagues\u201d were the source of the allegations in his letter claiming that Yovanovitch had disparaged Trump, not Parnas and Fruman. He also sought to distance himself Giuliani, who he described as a friend of more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cI do not know what his business or legal activities in Ukraine have been,\u201d the ex-congressman said of the president\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nThough Parnas posted a May 2018 photo of himself with a smiling Trump during a private dinner at the White House also attended by Fruman, the president denied having any idea who the two arrested men are.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen,\u201d said Trump, speaking on the South Lawn of the White House. \u201cNow it\u2019s possible that I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody\u2026I don\u2019t know them. I don\u2019t know about them. I don\u2019t know what they do. \u2026 Maybe they were clients of Rudy. You have to ask Rudy.\u201d\n\nA week after Parnas and Fruman visited Sessions in Washington, a company controlled by the pair, Global Energy Producers, gave $325,000 to a political action committee supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid, according to the committee\u2019s financial disclosure reports.\n\nThe pair obtained the money for the contribution through a private loan and then funneled it through a complex series of wire transfers through multiple bank accounts. Prosecutors alleged the transactions were intended to illegally conceal the true source of the funds.\n\nTax documents filed by a nonprofit wing of America First Action in November 2018 show a handful of Trump allies held key positions at the group, including Texas GOP fundraiser Roy Bailey, a longtime Sessions political supporter who was the finance co-chairman of Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Bailey, a lobbyist, is also a longtime business partner of Giuliani\u2019s.\n\nAlso serving in leadership roles at the Trump-aligned PAC were Tommy Hicks Jr., a Dallas investor and the current Republican National Committee co-chairman, as well as Nick Ayers, the former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nFour days after the $325,000 donation, Parnas posted a photo of himself and Fruman at an intimate \u201cPower Breakfast!!!\u201d with Hicks and Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge.\n\nAmerica First Action would go on to spend $3.1 million supporting Sessions failed re-election effort.\n\nU.S. laws allow unlimited donations by corporate entities to so-called super PACS, political action committees that are required to act independently from candidates.\n\nColumbia University Law professor Richard Briffaultsays told the AP that loopholes in U.S. law make it harder to detect foreign actors trying to influence the U.S. political system by funneling money through shell companies to super PACS. In this case, the money trail was revealed through a lawsuit against Parnas that forced the release of transfers and banking records earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this so dramatic is who these people are, their connection to Giuliani,\u201d said Briffault, who studies campaign finance. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bombshell because of its connection to Ukraine and Trump.\u201d\n\nAP reported on Sunday that Parnas told associates at two meetings in March that Trump planned to oust Yovanovitch, a career diplomat with a reputation for fighting corruption, with someone more amenable to their business plans, according to four people, three of whom spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity over concerns of retaliation. At the time, Parnas and Fruman were pursuing a potentially lucrative deal to sell shiploads of liquefied natural gas from the United States to Naftogaz, Ukraine\u2019s state-owned gas giant.\n\nIn what appeared to be a coordinated media campaign early this year, conservative outlets blitzed Yovanovitch with stories claiming she had protected Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden from Ukrainian prosecutors.\n\nCopies of some of these stories were later sent to the State Department stuffed in a manila envelope. Giuliani told The New York Times last week that the documents, which were recently provided to Congress by the State Department\u2019s inspector general, were produced by a \u201cprofessional investigator who works for my company.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch was recalled to Washington in May, months before she had been scheduled to leave her post in Kyiv.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Bryan Slodysko and Matthew Lee in Washington and Larry Neumeister in New York City contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Associated Press investigative reporter Michael Biesecker on Twitter at http://twitter.com/mbieseck and Desmond Butler at http://twitter.com/desmondbutler", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Businessmen with ties to Rudy Giuliani lobbied a U.S. congressman in 2018 for help ousting the American ambassador to Ukraine around the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/619dc5_trump-impeachment-giuliani-fixers-69382-courtroom-sketch-depicts-left-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
