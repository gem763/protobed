James Cartwright meets the fearless female activists behind the yellow pinnies\n\nWhile the world applauds the child protesters taking to the streets, fewer eyes are on their mums and grandmothers, whose activism is altogether quieter. In August 2014, gangs of older women in yellow tabards and headscarves started to become a common sight on Preston New Road in Lancashire. They call themselves the \u201cNanas\u201d, though not all are grandmas. They took the name as a nod to trust, family and tea, leaning into stereotypes of northern matriarchy. Their first project was to capture a field under planning application by Cuadrilla, a UK fossil fuels company seeking exploratory drilling rights for shale gas. They hopped over the fence, set up tents and claimed squatters\u2019 rights, staying for three weeks. By the time they left, the Nanas had earned the support of 14,000 local residents and appointments at Manchester\u2019s High Court, and their action, along with that of other campaigners, led to Lancashire County Council rejecting Cuadrilla\u2019s fracking application, a decision later overturned by the then secretary of state, Sajid Javid.\n\nIn the years since, the Nanas have mounted an often good-humoured war of attrition against Cuadrilla, whose drilling has caused tremors in the area. At the Bell Mouth, the entrance to the Preston New Road site, they sing, dance, knit, pray, read poems and monologues, and obstruct fracking activity wherever possible. They even have their own stage show and samba band. And every Wednesday, dressed in white, they stage a call for calm at a site where tensions between protesters and police often erupt into violence.\n\nIn November 2018, Cuadrilla stopped drilling after multiple earth tremors, two of which breached the government\u2019s traffic light system that requires fracking to be paused in the event of seismic activity that exceeds a magnitude of 0.5. Fracking resumed on 15 August 2019, but activity was suspended 11 days later, after the UK\u2019s largest fracking-induced seismic event.\n\nTwo weeks ago, just a couple of days before the Nanas celebrated 1,000 days of activism at Preston New Road, Cuadrilla announced that it would engage in no further fracking activity on the site before its licence expires at the end of November. The Nanas are now free to enjoy a frack-free Christmas, though they remain on site to make sure.\n\n\u2018If you don\u2019t stand up and do something, then who else will?\u2019: Anjie Mosher, 49, Nana Inappropriate\n\nI\u2019ve been an armchair activist for years. I\u2019m a lesbian, and in the early 80s I\u2019d done a bit of Section 28 business and got chased down my own street. But as the years went on I stopped being as active. I\u2019d see things and think, \u201cHuh, isn\u2019t that dreadful?\u201d and hope someone else would do something about it.\n\nThe earthquakes were the first time I heard about the Preston New Road site, and I lost a lot of sleep. I\u2019d just adopted two small boys and this was happening on my doorstep. Had I not become a mother I probably wouldn\u2019t have looked into it any further. But I wanted to know exactly what was going on. It\u2019s about my kids and their future. I\u2019ve got to protect them.\n\nAt first I researched both sides, the pros and cons, because you do tend to think that people who are protesting something might be a little extreme, a little bit nuts. And some are. But that\u2019s life. You look at any group of people and there are always a couple of nutters. That\u2019s how the idea of the Nanas came about. A few of us wanted to engage the public without being threatening or aggressive. There\u2019s nothing more gentle and unthreatening than your nana, and if your nana tells you something you listen, because nanas know best. We took the old matriarchal image of Hilda Ogden, put on our yellow tabards and headscarves, armed ourselves with feather dusters and little teapots and went to capture that field at daft o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\nThere are some moments in your life that stand out, and that\u2019s up there with one of the best of mine. Watching the sun rise after we\u2019d done, I felt as though I was on the right side of history. I no longer cared if the police came and picked me up because I knew I was doing the right thing.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a ball of rage inside me\u2019: Tina Rothery, 57, Nana Queenie\n\nI\u2019ve lived in all sorts of countries and at all sorts of income levels. I worked as a journalist in Hong Kong and managed pubs in London. I\u2019ve lived the good life with a maid and membership of the yacht club, and I\u2019ve lived the harder life as a single parent rummaging for change down the back of a sofa. I\u2019d always assumed I was fairly broad-minded, and then I came to activism and realised I wasn\u2019t at all. Finding an army of women of a certain age was the biggest surprise \u2013 the realisation that there was this untapped resource. We\u2019re cute, we\u2019re a bit broken, we\u2019re easily damaged \u2013 if the cops manhandle us, they\u2019re going to look awful for it.\n\nIn the early days we made such a difference so quickly. Within months the campaign here grew and we\u2019d built towers at the site and were sleeping in the entrance way, blocking lorries and getting moved at least 10 times a day by the police. That was great, we knew we were having an impact.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here for more than 960 days now, and everything we\u2019ve done has included humour, but there\u2019s a ball of rage inside me. Every Wednesday, when we do the call for calm, I generally put down the anger and think of it as a fresh start. We started Nana Samba as a kind of anger management for the Nanas. I took a drum and two sticks and I beat the hell out of it and I thought, \u201cI like this!\u201d Then I realised that when I\u2019m drumming I\u2019m harder to arrest. If I\u2019m walking in front of a truck with a drum, you can\u2019t really get a grip on me. I\u2019m getting quite good with the rhythms, too.\n\nWe get asked what we\u2019d do if it was all over \u2013 wouldn\u2019t we miss the comradeship? I don\u2019t have to worry now that we\u2019ve got a samba band. We\u2019re booked through to 2020. We had a gig last week, we\u2019ve got a gig next month. We\u2019ll just pursue our art and keep campaigning to protect our young.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t have the future I imagined\u2019: Kai Sinclair, 21, Nana Jigglypuff\n\nMy mum\u2019s quite ill and needs help walking. She wanted to come down here to look around and asked me to come with her. At the end of the day she went home and I didn\u2019t. I moved into camp a week later. I\u2019ve been here 14 months now.\n\nI\u2019m a photographer, so when I first came down I thought it would be a good project, but very quickly I started leaving my camera at home and taking part in the protest myself. Since then I\u2019ve explored a lot of different areas of activism. I went straight from being an observer to jumping in at the deep end. It\u2019s only recently that I\u2019ve started to explore the gentler side of protest, and that\u2019s why I joined the Nanas.\n\nI\u2019ve got two baby sisters and I want to protect the world for them. But I\u2019ve also just worked my arse off for three years finishing my degree. I\u2019d go to college and then come straight here to do a night shift then go back to college the next day. In 12 years, none of that hard work will matter if the world doesn\u2019t exist. I can\u2019t have the future I imagined for myself if all this continues \u2013 I can\u2019t think about having a family. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d want to bring more humans into a world that\u2019s about to end.\n\nI\u2019ve had talks with some of the security guards at the site and a few of them are against fracking themselves, but they need to feed their families. They don\u2019t want to be there, but they have to do it. We\u2019ve created a system where people can\u2019t risk talking about injustice because they might restrict their freedoms. It\u2019s a real risk.\n\nSometimes it seems like it\u2019s you against the world, but the past few months have felt a lot more hopeful. The youth strikes have been amazing. Everyone\u2019s finding their place with different protests.\n\n\u2018I used to be in the police\u2019: Tracey Booker, 58, Nana Dancing Queen\n\nI found out about fracking in the summer of 2017. I retired from the civil service in January 2018, so I\u2019ve been able to spend a lot of time up here. I was a senior executive officer investigating suicides in prisons. Before that I was a probation officer, and before that I was a police officer. When I was in that job I had to work at the miners\u2019 strikes, so I understand that the police here can\u2019t choose the beat they\u2019re on.\n\nBut I\u2019ve watched the way they behave and I hate it. I\u2019ve been subject to assault by the police myself. It astounds me that just because I\u2019m standing at the gate protesting a police officer feels they have the right to punch me in the breast. I would never have got away with anything like it while I was in the job.\n\nAt first I wasn\u2019t sure if I should tell people that I used to be police, but everyone knows now and it has its benefits to some degree. I\u2019m good at helping people out if they get arrested, putting their cases together and getting Freedom of Information Act requests done. I feel like I\u2019m a useful person to have around.\n\nHaving a Nana name makes you part of the community. Everyone has to agree to their own and it says something particular about you. I got mine when Vivienne Westwood came to visit. She came up specifically to dance to Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen in the Bell Mouth. When she arrived there wasn\u2019t much room for her to dance and she looked a bit lost, so I just put my arm around her and she gave me a kiss.\n\nSince I\u2019ve become an activist I\u2019ve done things that I\u2019d never have dreamed of doing before. I\u2019ve joined the samba band, performed in a play and been to protest rallies in London and at the Conservative conference. Activism has given me a different outlook on life, and made me feel much more whole in myself.\n\n\u2018We aren\u2019t typical activists\u2019: Jo Catlow-Morris, 57, Nana Dahling\n\nTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t the fracking that initially drew me to this place, it was the community \u2013 their honesty and their truthfulness and their resolve. I\u2019ve sympathised with the cause for a long time, and because I\u2019m in the performing arts people would always ask me to come down and choreograph a performance or a song at the gates. It was only when I gave up my job as a programme leader at a local uni that I was able to get more involved.\n\nI started to come to the call for calm on Wednesdays and spoke a lot to Becky, Tina\u2019s niece. She was telling me about taking the field in 2014 and I just said, \u201cStop, can I record you?\u201d We spoke for about 45 minutes, and when I listened back to it I knew I had to do something with it.\n\nNow I\u2019ve done 11 interviews and created a piece of theatre called Nanas with Banners. It\u2019s a mix of spoken word, music and dancing. Our next gig is in Sheffield later this month.\n\nThe main motivation is to communicate that we aren\u2019t typical activists, we\u2019re just mothers and sisters and hairdressers and nurses and whatever else. It\u2019s about normalising us and showing our extraordinary nature. When I first did the readings all the women were in floods of tears.\n\nI have a very conservative friend who has no sympathy with what\u2019s going on here, but he came to see the play and afterwards said: \u201cYou\u2019ve almost turned me. One day I\u2019ll come down there with you and meet the Nanas.\u201d He hasn\u2019t come yet, but if I\u2019ve done nothing else with these performances then I have at least changed one person\u2019s perspective.", "description": "After almost 1,000 days camping out in a field near Blackpool and obstructing fracking operations, the \u2018Nanas\u2019 have seen off energy company Cuadrilla.
