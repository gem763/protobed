The PIC, meanwhile, is suing a company in the Sekunjalo stable - AYO Technology Solutions - to return the R4.3bn it investment in late 2017. The court case has not yet commenced.\n\n\"I do solemnly believe this is also an underhanded attempt to obtain information relating to our legal case against the PIC and the GEPF,\" said Surv\u00e9, in a statement that was also carried on the front pages of some of the daily newspapers in the Independent Media stable.\n\nIn response to Surv\u00e9's claim, the FSCA said there was no conflict of interest, adding that Sithole was not involved in the search and search operation on Wednesday.\n\nThe regulator said that Sithole was appointed in April 2018 to perform the functions of FSCA commissioner as a \"transitional measure determined by the Minister of Finance\" . \"Therefore in this capacity he was mandated to appoint all the investigators of the FSCA, which he duly did on April 3, 2018 in order for the FSCA to fulfil its functions. These appointments did not relate to any particular investigation.\"\n\nThe regulator said that, beyond appointing investigators, Sithole \"has had no role in any investigations undertaken by the authority.\n\n\"The initiation and supervision of all our investigations, like all other operational functions, is delegated to the relevant divisional executive. Mr. Sithole was not involved in the search and seizure operation conducted by the FSCA on Wednesday, and there is no conflict of interest in this matter.\"", "description": "The FSCA on Wednesday raided the Cape Town offices of Surv\u00e9 to collect evidence for a market abuse case.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7223/e969efdad1374f39b68b98cd35df3bca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
