REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nSpain\u2019s main parties have consistently refused to hold an independence referendum in the region, although Sanchez\u2019s Socialists have said they are open to dialogue on other issues.\n\nHUNDREDS OF ARRESTS\n\nTorra said earlier this week said Catalonia should hold a new vote on self-determination within two years. On Saturday, he said the will of the people would be respected: \u201cWe will go as far as the people of Catalonia want to go\u201d.\n\nSome 300 people have been arrested in clashes that have flared throughout the region since Monday\u2019s court verdict.\n\nSpain\u2019s acting interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, defended police from accusations they had been heavy-handed.\n\n\u201cThe situation is under control. There is serious, organised violence ... but I reiterate that we are not being overwhelmed,\u201d he said after visiting injured police in hospital.\n\nBarcelona\u2019s mayor Ada Colau, who does not support the secessionist movement, said her city \u201cdoes not deserve what we are living through\u201d. Pavements had been torn up and hundreds of plastic garbage bins torched in the unrest, she said.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nBarcelona is Spain\u2019s second largest city and draws millions of tourists each year. Three city roads remained closed on Saturday because of the damage, with some foreign visitors caught unawares by the chaos and shocked by what they saw.\n\n\u201cWe got here and were like \u2018Oh God\u2019. The street was on fire in front of the hostel,\u201d said Flynn Winstanley, 18, a winery worker from Margaret River in Australia.", "description": "Spain's government dismissed calls on Saturday from Catalonia's pro-independence regional chief for talks over a wave of violence sparked by the jailing of separatist leaders, as police braced for fresh protests.", "authors": ["Isla Binnie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442658336&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0AK", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
