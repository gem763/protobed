The OSC report called Conway a \u201crepeat offender\u201d who shows \u201cdisregard for the law\u201d by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates in her White House role on TV and in social media.\n\nBut President Donald Trump refused to take action. Instead, the White House pressured OSC to retract the recommendation to fire Conway. Special Counsel Henry Kerner, a Trump appointee, responded that such a request was \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d and argued that allowing Conway to continue to violate the Hatch Act \u201cerodes\u201d the rule of law.\n\nWhen Conway was challenged in June by a reporter about her law-breaking, she responded: \u201cBlah, blah, blah ... Let me know when the jail sentence starts.\u201d (Check out the video clip above.)\n\n\u201cSince OSC\u2019s decision in June, it has been very obvious from Conway\u2019s continuing violations that she considers herself to be above the law,\u201d said Bookbinder. \u201cThe White House will not hold Conway accountable for her violations, and instead seems to be encouraging them. It is long past time for the abuses to stop.\u201d\n\nIn her first Hatch Act violation in 2017, Conway plugged Ivanka Trump\u2019s products on TV during an interview.\n\nThe Hatch Act was passed to ensure that federal employees, while they\u2019re being paid by taxpayers, don\u2019t exploit their position to promote one party over another or that party\u2019s candidates, as Conway has done repeatedly.\n\nCREW said that not only should Conway and Trump be called to account for violating the law but so, too, should Twitter. Twitter\u2019s Terms of Service require users to use the platform in compliance with all applicable laws.\n\nCREW is gathering signatures on a petition calling for Conway\u2019s ouster. As of late Friday it had collected 36,000 signatures. There was no immediate response from Conway.", "description": "The last time the White House aide was nabbed using her job for partisan politics, she responded: \u201cBlah, blah, blah ...
