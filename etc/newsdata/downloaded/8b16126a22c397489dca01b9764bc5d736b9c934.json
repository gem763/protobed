The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker awarded Trump four Pinocchios \u2014 its designation for a \u201cwhopper\u201d \u2014 for this claim in December 2015.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe has made various versions of the same basic claim, which is based off a few sentences in his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d: that Osama bin Laden was a threat and would \u201cdo damage\u201d to the United States. You can see how often, and how many ways, he\u2019s repeated this in the video above.\n\nTrump bases his claim that he \u201cpredicted Osama bin Laden\u201d on two separate, single references to bin Laden and to the 1993 World Trade Center attack in his 2000 book.\n\nBelow is the lone reference to bin Laden in Trump\u2019s 2000 book:\n\nOne day we\u2019re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin-Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it\u2019s on to a new enemy and new crisis.\n\nAnd below is the reference to the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center (Trump refers to the World Trade Center in a separate section of the book, but it is unrelated to terrorism):\n\nAD\n\nI really am convinced we\u2019re in danger of the sort of terrorist attacks that will make the bombing of the Trade Center look like kids playing with firecrackers. No sensible analyst rejects this possibility, and plenty of them, like me, are not wondering if but when it will happen.\n\nIn other words, Trump knew Osama bin Laden was a threat to America. And he thought America was at risk of a major terrorist attack. But he did not write about those two things as being intertwined.\n\nAD\n\nTrump leaves himself the tiniest bit of wiggle room when discussing his \u201cprediction\u201d of bin Laden and terrorism: He never directly says he predicted the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but suggests it would have been prevented had the United States killed bin Laden. And he suggests he was unique in his intuition about this.\n\n\u201cI was the one that called Osama bin Laden,\u201d Trump said on MSNBC on Dec. 8, 2015. \u201cHe \u2014 if I were \u2014 I would have had Osama bin Laden knocked out and maybe the World Trade Center, as it was, would have been standing right now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nExcept the United States conducted a raid in August 1998 to do just that, though bin Laden escaped. And as The Fact Checker\u2019s Glenn Kessler noted, bin Laden had been a public target of the United States for years and was indicted by a federal grand jury in 1998 for his role in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In 1999, CNN ran a headline that read, \u201cBin Laden feared to be planning terrorist attack.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd Trump did not predict that the World Trade Center would be hit, only that there would be an attack on a U.S. city in the future. (In a different chapter of that book, Trump suggested the attack could be carried out via an anthrax attack or a miniature nuclear device.)\n\nTen days after President Barack Obama ordered the raid that killed bin Laden in 2011, Trump touted his intuition.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have to say, if you look at Bill O\u2019Reilly from a few weeks ago, if you look at Neil Cavuto from not so long ago, I said, \u2018Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan,\u2019\u201d Trump said at the time.\n\nTrump did mention bin Laden and Pakistan during an April 2011 appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\" but it was not quite how Trump described it.\n\n\u201cIf Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan,\u201d Trump told O\u2019Reilly, \u201cwhy are we paying them hundreds of billions of dollars a year?\u201d\n\nEight years later, Trump is still lamenting that no one heeded a warning he didn\u2019t actually give.\n\nAD", "description": "President Trump has repeatedly claimed, falsely, that his 2000 book \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d predicted \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cOsama bin Laden.\u201d", "authors": ["Jm Rieger", "Video Editor For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/o6PvFGbrqhTiTYd1xY8Qq46wGuE=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-28-2019/t_da82b3e46fd54c64992b09b4da39ff3a_name_fbf8c0c4_f8c9_11e9_9e02_1d45cb3dfa8f_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
