But 9 of 10 Sanders supporters are open to voting for Clinton.", "language": "en", "text": "A raucous Democratic National Convention last night \u2014 rife with chants of, \"Bernie! Bernie!\" \"War hawk!\" and \"Goldman Sachs!\" \u2014 had many Democrats sweating over a lack of party unity.\n\nFor some time, there has been a prevailing fear that Bernie Sanders supporters will become Donald Trump converts, or turn to anti-establishment candidates like Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, instead of backing Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut according to new data from the Pew Research Center, 90 percent of the most ardent Sanders supporters \u2014 that is, those who have consistently stuck with him since the beginning of the election \u2014 will support Clinton in the general election.\n\nSanders had some committed supporters \u2014 but the vast majority seem open to supporting Clinton\n\nSanders did have committed supporters through the primary: Pew found that 20 percent supported Sanders from December 2015 to April 2016 (close to the end of the primaries).\n\nBut now that Sanders\u2019s hopes for a 2016 nomination have been dashed, his supporters have mostly gravitated toward Clinton.\n\nThe Pew study, which surveyed 2,353 Democratic voters, found that of this 20 percent, 90 percent now endorse Hillary Clinton. Only 8 percent support Donald Trump, and the remaining 2 percent are undecided.\n\nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver aptly points out a few flaws with this Pew study: For example, it doesn't allow voters to choose a third-party candidate like Stein or Johnson, which they will be able to do come November: \"90% is what you get if you *force* Sanders voters to choose between Clinton and Trump,\" he writes.\n\nStill, these numbers are a reminder that the \"Bernie or bust\" dissenters who vocally expressed their discontent at the DNC last night are a minority.\n\nMost Bernie supporters can at least foresee a world in which they would rather vote for Clinton than not vote at all.", "description": "Sanders supporters are more open to supporting Clinton than you might think.", "authors": ["Zachary Crockett", "Zeeshan Aleem", "Constance Grady", "Nicole Narea", "Hannah Brown", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQgSn2iS4vVtem4uOm4aRP86WsU=/0x127:1343x882/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/50206919/hillary-cover.0.0.png", "published_at": "2016-07-26"}
