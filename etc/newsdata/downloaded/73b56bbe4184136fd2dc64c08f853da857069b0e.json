I know that this is not good enough,' he said.\n\nIn delivering her sentence, the judge recalled how the Kmart store was crowded that afternoon in December 2018.\n\nThe girl's mother was standing nearby while her daughter looked in the toy section.\n\nFree said in a letter to the court: 'I can only ever say sorry. I know that this is not good enough'\n\nScene of the crime: The little girl was searching the toy aisles for a present while her mother stood nearby, when the predator led her away\n\nFree told her to 'follow me' then drove her 30 minutes' away to remote Pumicestone Passage and sexually assaulted her. He then returning to the shopping centre.\n\nThe girl's mother kept a stern look on her face throughout the sentencing, with a supporter crying and sinking forward.\n\nThe family were accompanied by police and child protection advocates Bruce and Denise Morcombe.\n\nMr Morcombe said the mother was 'shaken' by the sentence but 'she was in a space where the advisers had indicated that was probably where (the sentence) was going to sit'.\n\nFree has spent 306 days in custody, including five months in solitary confinement.\n\nCHILD PREDATOR STERLING FREE'S LETTER TO THE COURT Child predator Sterling Free wrote a letter to the court, which was read out by his lawyer outside the court complex today 'I accept full responsibility for my actions against the young girl. I know the enormous pain I have caused her, her family, my own family and children. 'I today accept without reservation the punishment imposed by the justice system today. 'I do not wish to cause any further pain to the young victim or her family or delay justice any further. 'I cannot comprehend the pain that I have caused her. I took away her innocence and scared her family. 'I hope that today my sentence provides her and her family some hope for the future. 'I can only ever say sorry. I know that this is not good enough. 'I'm not looking for forgiveness but only to let you know the harm that I have done, the harm that I have caused. 'I cannot imagine the pain and fear I have caused. I can't take that back. 'To my family, the shock you have had to deal with, the public scrutiny was immense, my children deserve better. 'They will now grow up without a father and I can only blame myself. I cannot comprehend the damage I have caused. I will seek treatment to ensure this doesn't occur again. 'I am committed to using my incarceration to seek professional assistance that I duly require.'\n\nEARLIER\n\nThe mother of a little girl abducted from a Kmart store and taken into bushland where she was sexually assaulted has spoken for the first time about her child's horrific ordeal.\n\nOn the day the child's attacker, Sterling Mervyn Free, 27, is due to be sentenced, the victim's mother said no punishment will ever fit the crime committed upon her daughter.\n\nThe mother was shopping with her child at Westfield North Lakes, when Free lured the girl away.\n\n'My tiny innocent girl was well aware of stranger danger, however this person was friendly to her and tricked her into following him,' the mother said in a statement.\n\n'No child should ever have to go through this type of trauma, and no sentence will ever be long enough to make up for the ongoing effects this will have on her.'\n\n'We, as a family, remain positive and are trying to move forward. We would like to thank the Queensland Police Service, the Queensland DPP and the Australian public for their support throughout this ordeal'.\n\nAnatomy of a crime: Sterling Free (on left) abducted the girl as she milled about the toy aisle at Kmart North Lakes on December 8, 2018, while he was Christmas shopping\n\nBrisbane District Court has previously heard that the girl was milling about the toy section of the store, near her mother, when the opportunistic, Christmas-shopping predator led her away.\n\nFree took the child to his car, drove her into secluded bushland, assaulted her and then dropped her back at the shopping centre about 90 minutes later, where she was reunited with her mum.\n\nBruce Morcombe, the well-known father of the abducted and murdered boy Daniel Morcombe, told Daily Mail Australia he hopes Free's sentence will serve as a 'resounding deterrent' to predators.\n\n'It needs to be loud and clear - hands off our kids,' Mr Morcombe said.\n\n'That's what it needs to be: \"Sterling, mate, you're going to jail for a long time.\"\n\n'It needs to send a message to all Queenslanders who have a fascination with our kids: don't go there, because you'll be doing a long stretch.'\n\nMr Morcombe has a strong personal interest - not just because of what happened to his own son - as he has met the victim and her 'very loving and strong family'.\n\nA 'brazen and predatory' crime: What the judge must consider\n\nThe victim's family watched on in court earlier this week as Free faced sentencing proceedings, almost a year after confessing his crimes to police.\n\nFree - a father-of-two and Fantastic Furniture worker before to his arrest - formally admitted to three charges at the state's District Court.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to taking a child for immoral purposes, deprivation of liberty and indecent treatment of a child under 12.\n\nOn Tuesday, prosecutor Judy Geary told Judge Julie Dick to consider that there was a 'brazen, determined nature (to Free's offending)'.\n\nMs Geary told the sentencing hearing that Free's behaviour 'can only be described as predatory'.\n\nShe said that Free had 'preyed upon (the victim's) naivety and trusting nature' to lure the girl away.\n\nFree leads the little girl away, in footage shown to the court. The court heard Free lurked in the Kmart toy section corridors before telling her to 'follow me'\n\nFree worked at Fantastic Furniture and is the father of twins\n\nThere were tears in the court's public gallery as the judge was shown CCTV footage of the girl being led out of the shopping centre.\n\nThe prosecutor said the victim would have been left feeling 'completely helpless' as he took her to secluded bushland at Pumicestone Passage, about 30 minutes drive away, and assaulted her.\n\nDefence barrister Angus Edwards told reportedly the court his client's actions were appalling but said Free had demonstrated 'genuine' remorse.\n\nMr Edwards said his client had confessed his crimes to police, had pleaded guilty early and cooperated with authorities.\n\nHis client had an online porn addiction, a paedophilic disorder and poor impulse control, the judge was told.\n\nProsecutors called for Free to be handed a 10 year jail term, while Free's solicitor has said he hopes for a six-to-nine year term.\n\nThe maximum penalty is 20 years' imprisonment.\n\n'It's the simplicity of it, that's why Australians reacted to it'\n\nBruce Morcombe and his wife Denise became child protection advocates after their son Daniel was kidnapped and killed in December 2003\n\nIn an interview, Mr Morcombe said he was hoping the judge will hand down a 'resounding deterrent'.\n\n'We cannot get a slap on the wrist here because there will be copycats,' he said.\n\nThere is little doubt Free's heinous actions shocked the community.\n\nAfter his arrest, Free was kept in isolation because of a barrage of threats to his safety that were posted online.\n\nA local court magistrate also initially limited details that could be reported about the case in the press.\n\nThe circumstances of how Free snatched the victim - at a shopping mall not far from the girl's mum - had disturbing echoes of other infamous abductions, such as Mr Morcombe's own son, Daniel.\n\n(Daniel was snatched by predator Brett Peter Cowan near a bus stop in December 2003.)\n\nMr Morcombe said: 'It's the simplicity of it, I think that's why Australians reacted to it ... the brazenness of it.'\n\nNo matter what happens today, the child protection campaigner said there is one thing he is certain of.\n\n'The youngster (Free's victim) is being well cared for and the family is very strong and focused on putting their lives together,' Mr Morcombe said.\n\n'She is surrounded by help both within the family unit and is receiving counselling. She's in good hands.'", "description": "The brazen predator who abducted a girl, seven, from the toy aisle of a Kmart and raped her in bushland will be eligible for parole in just two years.", "authors": ["Daniel Piotrowski In Brisbane For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/00/19563942-0-image-a-6_1570750287761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
