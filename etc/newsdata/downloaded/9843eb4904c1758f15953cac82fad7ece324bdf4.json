The chaotic reunification process only added to their ordeal.\n\nThe Associated Press obtained a copy of the report in advance of the official release.\n\nThe children, many already distressed in their home countries or by their journey, showed more fear, feelings of abandonment and post-traumatic stress symptoms than children who were not separated, according to a report from the inspector general\u2019s office in the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nSome cried inconsolably. Others believed their parents had abandoned them and were angry and confused. \u201cOther children expressed feelings of fear or guilt and became concerned for their parents\u2019 welfare,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe report is the first substantial accounting by a government agency on how family separation under the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy has affected the mental health of children. It was based on interviews with about 100 mental health clinicians who had regular interactions with children but did not directly address the quality of the care the children did receive.\n\nThe separations have been widely criticized, and children\u2019s health advocates have said the kids likely suffered trauma. A second report by the watchdog, also released Wednesday, found that thousands of childcare workers were given direct access to migrant children before completing required background and fingerprint checks.\n\nOne little boy, about 7 or 8, was separated from his father and did not know why, according to the inspector general. He believed that his dad was killed and he would also be killed.\n\n\u201cThis child ultimately required emergency psychiatric care to address his mental health distress,\u201d a program director told investigators.\n\nSome of the separated children suffered physical symptoms because of their mental trauma, clinicians reported.\n\n\u201cYou get a lot of \u2018my chest hurts,\u2019 even though everything is fine (medically). Children describe symptoms \u2014 \u2018Every heartbeat hurts,\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t feel my heart\u2019 \u2014 of emotional pain,\u201d a clinician told investigators.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images A female minor rests her head on a bench in the US Border Patrol Central Processing Center in McAllen, Texas on August 12, 2019.\n\nThe report covers a period last year when facilities were overwhelmed under the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, under which at least 2,500 children were separated from their parents. Children stayed behind in border custody while their parents were taken to federal court for criminal proceedings. Children held longer than 72 hours were transferred into HHS custody and placed in shelters that have traditionally cared for children who crossed the border alone.\n\nMigrant children stay in the shelters, run by government-funded organizations, until released to a sponsor, usually a parent or close relative.\n\nPrevious reports have highlighted the disorganized reunification effort, and a lack of government planning on how to bring families together after they have been separated. Others have said thousands more children than initially reported may have been separated.\n\nThe watchdog said the longer children were in custody, the more their mental health deteriorated, and it recommended minimizing that time. It also suggested the creation of better mental health care options and the hiring of more trained staff.\n\nThe Administration for Children and Families, the HHS division that manages children, concurred with the recommendations and said it had already begun implementing them, including hiring a board-certified child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist to serve as a mental health team leader.\n\nDepartment Assistant Secretary Lynn Johnson said in a letter to the watchdog that the average length of stay is much shorter now than it was last year, and noted the report was not a clinical review of treatment.\n\nShe wrote that \u201csignificant factors\u201d beyond the agency\u2019s control contributed to \u201cthe issues identified in the report.\u201d Those included a surge in children at the border, the children\u2019s unique mental health needs and a shortage of qualified bilingual clinicians, especially in rural areas.\n\nShe said that efforts were made to bring in more medical health professionals, but \u201cadverse media coverage and negative public perception ... have hampered efforts to expand.\u201d\n\nAfter a federal judge ordered the children reunified with their parents, guidance on how to do it kept changing and that led to further anxiety and distress, according to the report.\n\nSome facilities said reunifications were scheduled with little notice or suddenly canceled.\n\nIn one case, a child was moved from a Florida facility to Texas to be reunited with her father. After the child made several trips to the detention center, she was returned to the Florida facility \u201cin shambles,\u201d without ever seeing him.\n\nInvestigators visited 45 facilities in 10 states during August and September of 2018, interviewing about 100 mental health clinicians who had regular interactions with children and staff.\n\nDuring the interviews, there were almost 9,000 children in shelters; nearly 85% were 13-17 in age, 13% were 6-12 and 2% were infants to age 5.\n\nAt a minimum, each child in government custody is to receive one counseling session per week, plus two group sessions to discuss issues.\n\nBut the report found that mental health staff were overwhelmed. Usually there is one mental health clinician for 12 children, but during the period investigators studied, there were more than 25 children for one clinician.\n\nA separate Office of Inspector General report also released Wednesday found 31 of the 45 facilities reviewed had hired case managers who did not meet Office of Refugee Resettlement requirements, including many without the required education. In addition, the review found 28 of the 45 facilities didn\u2019t have enough mental health workers.\n\nThat meant some children didn\u2019t receive proper treatment, the report found. And some children who suffered more severe illnesses \u2014 self-harming, suicidal behavior or actual suicide attempts \u2014 were not transferred quickly enough to residential treatment centers.\n\nDuring a time when sponsors had to be fingerprinted, children were held in facilities for as long as 93 days. The fingerprints were sent to U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement and some people in the United States illegally were arrested. Advocates said many potential sponsors feared coming to get the children while the policy was in effect.\n\nAfter it was ditched in March, the average length of stay dropped to 58 days and was 48 days in April.\n\nThe report also addressed the question of whether children were being given psychotropic medications after media reports described the practice. The report found the instances were very minimal; about 300 children overall between May and July of 2018 were prescribed antidepressants. Staff described reluctant children who didn\u2019t want to take medication, and some concerns that dosage or type of medication may not have been right.\n\nIn the second report, only four of the 45 shelters reviewed by the U.S. Health and Human Services inspector general met all staff screening requirements. Caregivers at more than half of those shelters worked with migrant toddlers, children and teens who were separated from their parents or who were traveling alone before their background check results were complete.\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said children deserve compassionate care.\n\n\u201cGrantees and contractors that fail to ensure their employees are checked appropriately should not be allowed to care for these children,\u201d said Portman.\n\nFederal investigators also found some shelters relying on employees to report their own criminal histories. A background check found one employee \u2014 who \u201cself-certified\u201d that she had no history for crimes involving child abuse \u2014 had a third-degree child neglect felony on her record.\n\nThe inspector general found the federal government granted waivers from conducting child protective service reviews at four behavioral health residential facilities last year, in violation of the agency\u2019s rules which give authority to grant waivers only at emergency influx detention camps.\n\nThose waivers, for caregivers at two facilities holding thousands of children at Homestead, Florida, and Tornillo, Texas, were previously disclosed. Tornillo has closed and Homestead is empty but on \u201cwarm status\u201d and could be reactivated.", "description": "A government report found the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy caused serious mental health problems in detained children.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6fcdcf3b00007902ccc481.jpeg?cache=v5jjbbf3b9&ops=1778_1000"}
