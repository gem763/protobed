Thankfully, she is ok and continuing with the show #ENIGMA\u2019.\n\nThe video was also captioned: \u2018Holy s**t I can\u2019t believe I got that on camera wait for her to fall holy s**t\u2019.\n\nGaga had been dancing with her legs wrapped around a fan before they both fell off the stage (Picture: @DiamondDelGagas/Twitter)\n\nWe can imagine Gaga is feeling pretty bruised today\u2026 (Picture: Getty)\n\nGaga hasn\u2019t addressed the incident on her social media accounts, but shared videos of her preparing for her performance with what appeared to be a reformer Pilates machine backstage.\n\nThe Enigma residency has been at the Park MGM in Las Vegas since December 2018, with breaks from February to May 2019 and from the end of June until this week.\n\nThe show is due to wrap up in May 2020, and the two-year contract is said to be netting Gaga \u2013 real name Stefani Germanotta \u2013 in the region of $100 million (\u00a378 million).\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the nobody else drops Gaga off the stage \u2013 she can\u2019t afford any injuries with a schedule this busy.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
