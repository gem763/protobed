While doing so however, he flippantly described the sweet treats as \u201cdiabetes on a plate,\u201d and it\u2019s safe to say his comment didn\u2019t go down well with fans.\n\nRead more: 'The Great British Bake Off': Meet the 2019 finalists and find out who crashed out in the semi-final\n\nFollowing the social media backlash, the 53-year-old shared a Instagram post of a batch of sugar-glazed Chelsea buns alongside the caption: \u201cA remark re:- diabetes I made on tonight\u2019s show was thoughtless and I meant no harm, as both my grandad and my own mother suffer/ suffered from diabetes \u2026 apologies X.\"\n\nAs soon as he made the quip as the broadcast aired on Tuesday 22 October, watchers took to Twitter and Instagram to say: \u201cAnyone else shocked at Paul Hollywood\u2019s \u2018diabetes on a plate\u2019 comment when discussing a dessert on tonight\u2019s episode of GBBO?\n\n\u201cI feel like this kind of stuff just reinforces uneducated and frankly stupid ideas and questions about diabetes, for example, \u2018did you get it cos you eat too much cake?\u2019 and my personal favourite, \u2018if you ate this Mars bar, would you die?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother called Hollywood\u2019s wording \u201cirresponsible,\u201d adding: \u201cIt is untrue to say it of anyone, whatever their type of diabetes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is NOT diabetes on a plate... So saddened to see these myths being shown on your show. Type 1 diabetes has NOTHING to do with diet of lifestyle,\u201d a fourth echoed, as they tagged Hollywood\u2019s official Twitter account.\n\nRead more: 'Bake Off' star Candice Brown received death threats for wearing lipstick\n\n\u201cThe phrase \u2018Diabetes on a plate\u2019 needs to stop being used,\u201d one more chimed in. \u201cPlease educate yourself on Diabetes. That\u2019s just not how it works. Stop adding to the stigmatism! I\u2019m disappointed in Paul Hollywood and Bake Off for using such s****y, damaging words.\u201d\n\nThe Great British Bake Off continues on Tuesday 29 October at 8pm on Channel 4, where finalists health adviser David Atherton, geography teacher Alice Fevronia and shop assistant Steph Blackwell will compete to become the ultimate star baker.\n\nWatch the latest videos from Yahoo UK Lifestyle", "description": "The celebrity judge was called out by viewers after making the remark during the show's semi-final.", "authors": ["Amy West"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k7X8dGOGEhjKwnurgqLORg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/29e9ef00-f634-11e9-9fa4-7dfa6cd5aa9c", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
