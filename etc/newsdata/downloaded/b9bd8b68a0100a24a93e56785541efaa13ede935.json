S&P says Mexican government's 2020 growth forecast likely too optimistic\n\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - S&P Global (NYSE: ) Ratings said on Friday that the Mexican government's 2020 economic growth forecast of 1.5% to 2.5% likely is too optimistic.\n\nThe government's growth forecast is part of its 2020 budget blueprint unveiled last weekend, which also slightly loosened a primary surplus target as the government aimed to balance big welfare promises with the reality of a stagnant economy.\n\n\"It's probable that our updated growth projections will be more conservative,\" S&P Global Ratings said in a statement, referring to the agency's upcoming forecast for the third quarter.\n\nS&P added that the government's estimates for financing requirements and a 2020 primary budget surplus are in line with its own expectations. But it said it sees a risk that the government's oil output forecast of 1.9 million barrels per day will not be met next year.\n\nCurrent oil output, the vast majority of which is produced by state-owned Pemex, averages about 1.7 million barrels per day.", "description": "S&P says Mexican government's 2020 growth forecast likely too optimistic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB2C0AG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
