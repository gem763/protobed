Every bit as void, we might imagine, as Boris Johnson\u2019s bowels became shortly after he was awoken in New York with the news that he had, if you\u2019ll forgive the legal jargon, s*** the bed.\n\nEven the legal experts who had anticipated the result never foresaw that it would be delivered with an 11-0 hammering. This is important. Had the justices decided the case 6-5, 7-4, or any tightish split decision, it would be much easier for the purveyors of choicest b*****ks to portray this as a fiendish Remainy plot.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But with not a single justice dissenting, their prey will be restricted to a rump of the willfully credulous.\n\nAnd so to the most frequent, pointless and inevitable of the standard Brexit questions: where next?\n\nOne assumes Johnson will fire his faux-prorogation \u201cmastermind\u201d Dominic Cummings, and also perhaps the sonorous attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who gave the idiocy of prorogation his approval. One also assumes that Johnson will then cling to what little remains of his power unless and until the Commons removes him and installs an alternative government.\n\nWhether the Brexit fundamentals will change in any substantive way is another matter, since what might feel like a meaningful turning point might be trivialised by the political aftershocks.\n\nWhat has undeniably shifted is the mood. Psychologically, this feels like a different country than it did a few hours ago. The system, in so far as there is one in a constitution-free nation, worked. The antibodies in the body politic kicked in. The democratic immune system revived, and killed this amateurishly malignant stab at bargain-basement dictatorship before it had a chance to spread.\n\nTwo laws were upheld today. One was the bemusing daisy chain of case law, legislation and convention that establishes parliament as sovereign; the other was the even older law of unintended consequences. In trying to bulldoze through the thin partitions that confine a prime minister to an honour code of lowest-common-denomination decency, Johnson strengthened them immeasurably.\n\nWhether or not his threat to prorogue for what we now know would be the first time this session is an empty bluff, no PM will dare attempt such a gangsterish stunt again after this one took such a punishment beating from the lustrous Lady Hale.\n\n\u201cDonnez-moi a break\u201d was Johnson\u2019s typically droll pre-judgment lurch into Franglais when asked if losing the case would cause him to resign. He will limp on. He may even spike a point or two in the polls from peddling his lone warrior against the establishment drivel.\n\nBut the Supremes lui ont donne a break all right. They broke the legs of his cocky disregard for the law in 11 places. They didn\u2019t call him a brazen liar in so many words, or so few. They didn\u2019t need to.\n\nThey smashed his blithe dishonesty to smithereens with a controlled, forensic savagery: no evidence offered, even in his own witness statement, of any need to advise the Queen that a five-week prorogation was required; no justification whatever for taking action with such an extreme effect.\n\nThere are heroes apart from and more heroic than the Supremes, who of course merely performed their function. Gina Miller, the QCs Jolyon Maugham and David Pannick, MSP Joanna Cherry, onetime Gordon Brown adviser Stewart Wood and others who brought and prosecuted the case ... their names deserve to be immortalised in the epic poetry of the age for sustaining the flame of natural justice and democracy.\n\nIt is hardly an inferno. It guttered alarmingly; for a while, it looked likely to be extinguished. But it burns yet, and if it doesn\u2019t incinerate this grotesque apology for a prime minister, it has coloured him red with global embarrassment.\n\nAnd now that we\u2019ve emerged from the shower like Bobby Ewing and discovered it was all a nightmare, the soap opera melodramatics resume. Where the narrative arc of the next season will take us, God only knows. But fretting about that can wait until the morning, when the parliament that never actually went away returns. For a few hours, we are entitled to drink in the relief and gorge on the schadenfreude.", "description": "Allow me to be the 1,273,793rd of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects to say this: there has never been a day like today.
