The Bengals got a late touchdown on a run by Andy Dalton with 1:28 left.\n\nThe Bengals running backs had a total of 14 rushing yards on 10 carries. Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson ran for career-high 151 yards on 18 carries \u2013 and he lost three yards taking a knee on the last three plays.\n\nThe Ravens rushed for 272 yards a week after the Bengals gave up 266 to the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nCornerback Dre Kirkpatrick (knee) and guard John Miller (groin) were injured in the loss.\n\nBrandon Wilson took the opening kickoff back 92 yards to give the Bengals the early lead. All-pro kicker Justin Tucker tried to get fancy with a high kick to the 8. Wilson took it in stride. Once he broke the initial group of tacklers, it was just a race to the goal line. Wilson won it easily.\n\nRandy Bullock's kick made it 7-0.\n\nSpoiler alert: That was as good as it got for the Bengals.\n\nThe lead didn't last long. The Ravens went 75 yards in the six plays. Jackson did most of the damage, ripping off a 36-yard run and taking it the last 21 yards for TD.\n\nThe Bengals went 3-and-out on their first drive.\n\nThe Ravens responded with another drive that simply shredded the defense on a 10-play, 66 yard drive. Jackson was 4-for-5 for 54 yards on the drive and ran it three times for 22 yards. Tucker's kick made it 14-7 with 4:01 left in the quarter.\n\nThe Bengals went 3-and-out again. Dalton started the game 0-for-3 \u2013 all bad throws.\n\nThe defense scored a victory of sorts, holding the Ravens to a 40-yard field on the next drive. Still, it was 17-7, eight seconds in the second quarter.\n\nThe Bengals finally got something going offensively late in the half. Dalton hit Alex Erickson for 10 yards, Joe Mixon for 23 on a screen, Taylor Eifert for 7 to pick to pick up a first down and Auden Tate for 16 to the Baltimore 21.\n\nBut Dalton threw an awful ball, trying to hit Tyler Boyd. Josh Bynes tipped it, and Marlon Humphrey picked it off.\n\nBaltimore gave the ball up four plays later on Mark Andrews' fumble.\n\nPasses of 12 and 17 yards to Tate helped the Bengals get to Baltimore 4. But a run by Giovani Bernard and another by Mixon went nowhere, and Dalton overthrew Erickson on third down.\n\nBullock's 22-yard field made it 17-10 with 36 seconds left in the half. Given the way the half started, the Bengals had to be thrilled to go into the half down by one score.\n\nThe Ravens pushed the lead back to 10 at 20-10 on Tucker's 49-yard field goal with two seconds left in the third quarter.\n\nBaltimore iced the game with an 18-play, 83-drive that ended with Tucker's 21-yard field goal. The drive took 9:44 off the clock.", "description": "The Bengals are 0-6 after they couldn't find a way to stop a Ravens rushing attack that piled up 272 yards in a 23-17 win.", "authors": ["John Fay", "Published P.M.
