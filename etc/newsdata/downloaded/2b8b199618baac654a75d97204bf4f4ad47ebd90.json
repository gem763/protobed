Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and other candidates vying for the Democratic nomination are taking a broader look at mental-health policy, highlighting everything from criminal justice reform to financial incentives for insurers to cover treatment. Some also back a national mental-health hotline.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think changes in mental-health governmental policies would have an effect on the frequency of mass shootings? Join the conversation below.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says lawmakers in coming months will review ideas to prevent gun violence that likely will include mental-health issues. The White House is planning to roll out policy proposals that could include an executive order on the topic.\n\nPrivacy-rights and mental-health groups worry lawmakers will endorse practices that fell out of favor decades ago, such as wider use of involuntary commitment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned,\u201d said Ari Ne\u2019eman, who advises the American Civil Liberties Union on disability policy. \u201cWhen it comes to the history of institutionalization and involuntary commitment, we\u2019re talking about a history that\u2019s rife with abuse.\u201d\n\nConservatives have joined Mr. Trump in calling for more psychiatric hospitals. They point to data showing the number of state psychiatric beds declined from more than 550,000 in the 1950s to about 40,000 today. Today, people with mental-health issues may have to wait days or weeks in emergency rooms for available beds.\n\nThe issue is expected to stay at the forefront of the Democratic primary race this fall. Prominent mental-health groups including the National Alliance on Mental Illness and the National Council for Behavioral Health have joined forces to sponsor a series of forums with presidential candidates in Iowa starting Sept. 27.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates are largely focused on mental health in the context of the opioid epidemic and a national suicide rate that has reached its highest level since World War II.\n\nRelated video President Trump touted his belief in protecting the Second Amendment and his relationship with the NRA on Friday, but expressed optimism that Republicans would join with Democrats in Congress to consider \"common sense, sensible, important background checks.\u201d Photo: AP\n\nThey say intertwining mass shooting prevention with mental-health initiatives is misguided and deflects from what they see as the need to focus on gun control.\n\n\u201cThe president is entering a danger zone because he\u2019s politicizing mental health care to deflect from gun violence,\u201d said Ryan Hampton, an advocate who worked with Mr. Trump and Congress on the passage of a law tackling the opioid epidemic. \u201cYou have to deal with gun violence and deal with mental health and addiction, but you don\u2019t throw them in the same bucket.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, however, has linked mass shootings to the idea that the U.S. lacks psychiatric institutions and that \u201cpeople can\u2019t get adequate care.\u201d He has said a shortage of institutions has left \u201cdangerous people\u201d on the streets.\n\nAmong 2020 Democratic contenders, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has proposed expanding access to medication that helps with opioid addiction and imposing financial penalties on insurers that don\u2019t cover mental-health services as robustly as medical benefits.\n\nMr. Sanders says his Medicare for All proposal would boost coverage of and access to mental-health treatment, and he has called for expanding community health centers. Ms. Warren wants to crack down on insurance practices that prevent patients from accessing mental health care.\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey backs a federal licensing program that he says would make it harder for those at risk of suicide to buy a gun. He says he would also appoint a federal coordinator with the sole purpose of reducing the suicide rate.\n\nRepublicans have more directly linked mental health and gun violence, particularly after a shooting last month in Dayton, Ohio. People who knew the gunman said they had seen warning signs that he could become violent before he killed nine people.\n\nThe White House is fast-tracking its work on mental-health proposals that officials say were already under way before the gun violence in August, which delayed a planned September rollout of an administration health proposal and executive order on Medicare.\n\nMr. Trump has advocated detection software that he said could prevent mass murders. He has also talked about enhanced civil commitments and more psychiatric institutions, although he proposed large cuts to Medicaid, the largest payer for mental-health services in the U.S., in his 2020 budget.\n\n\u201cIn the old days, you could put him in a mental institution,\u201d the president said in February 2018 of the gunman behind a shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school that left 17 dead.\n\nThe drop in available beds at psychiatric facilities came in part because states wanted relief from the high costs of inpatient residential care. But it also happened as treatment shifted to community-based services, as research showed it was more effective than institutionalization, said Mr. Ne\u2019eman with the ACLU.\n\nThose programs include housing support, mobile crisis teams and assistance with finding and keeping jobs. Mental-health groups are hoping the new focus on mental health will mean more funding for such services, even as they prepare to push back on proposals they say could roll back progress made with mental-health treatment.\n\nWrite to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com", "description": "The 2020 presidential campaign has revealed a clear split on the future of mental health policy, with President Trump focused primarily on addressing gun violence and his potential Democratic foes making a wider variety of proposals.", "authors": ["Stephanie Armour", "Stephanie.Armour Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103989/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
