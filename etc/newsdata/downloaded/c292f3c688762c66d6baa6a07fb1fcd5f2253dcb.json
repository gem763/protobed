General Assembly in New York on September 25, 2019 | Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Images Romania\u2019s presidential candidates make pilgrimage to America Trips are meant to show voters back home that the candidate has access to top US officials.\n\nFor Romania's presidential hopefuls, the best way to boost their chances of winning is a trip across the Atlantic.\n\nAt least that's what the top three candidates in the country's November presidential election seem to think \u2014 all of them traveled to the United States last week.\n\nThe incumbent, Klaus Iohannis, was at the United Nations General Assembly. Prime Minister Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 was nearby, meeting the mayor of Jersey City and the U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. And the candidate of the opposition USR-Plus Alliance, Dan Barna, also had meetings in Washington, D.C. and New York.\n\nFor the candidates, it's a good way of showing Romanians that they have access to top U.S. officials, important given that the president is in charge of foreign policy, according to Radu Magdin, a political consultant.\n\nWhether those trips result in any tangible benefits for Romania is questionable. But having a friendly relationship with the U.S. isn't something many EU leaders can claim to have at the moment, said Cristian P\u00e2rvulescu, a political analyst and professor at the National School of Political Studies and Public Administration in Bucharest.\n\nTrump, for his part, seemed happy to give Iohannis a campaign boost.\n\nMagdin, however, criticized the trips as a mere photo op, saying: \"They want to take good quality pictures that they can put on Facebook,\" rather than trying to exercise real political influence.\n\nMake Romania Great Again\n\nAs photo ops go, Romania's sitting president and current front-runner in the election, Iohannis, scored the top prize \u2014 a meeting in August with U.S. President Donald Trump, who handed him a white \"Make Romania Great Again\" hat, which Iohannis accepted with a laugh.\n\nTrump, for his part, seemed happy to give Iohannis a campaign boost. \"I think that this is a man that can solve the corruption problem in Romania,\" the U.S. president said. \"And I hear there\u2019s a little political season going on in Romania, but I would imagine you\u2019re going to do very well because you\u2019re very talented, you love the people.\"\n\nWhile Iohannis isn't a Trump-esque figure \u2014he's trying to project a socially liberal, progressive image in Romania \u2014 the ideological gulf between the two doesn't matter much, P\u00e2rvulescu said. \"It's about the Romanian-American friendship more than just about Trump.\"\n\nD\u0103ncil\u0103's meeting with the mayor of Jersey City, where some 35,000 Romanians live, also drew mockery.\n\nThe trip of D\u0103ncil\u0103, the current prime minister and the Social Democratic Party (PSD) candidate for president, didn't go as smoothly. She met with Perry last week, but in his tweet about the meeting, the energy secretary forgot to mention D\u0103ncil\u0103, prompting ridicule from parts of the Romanian media critical of the prime minister.\n\nD\u0103ncil\u0103's meeting with the mayor of Jersey City, where some 35,000 Romanians live, also drew mockery. Some media outlets and opposition politicians noted that Jersey City was the second-biggest city in the state of New Jersey, arguing it was not significant enough for the prime minister to meet its mayor.\n\nA meeting with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was also initially on the books for the prime minister but that was canceled following the launch of an impeachment inquiry against Trump, a Romanian government source said.\n\nBack in Romania, D\u0103ncil\u0103 touted agreements she signed with the World Bank and Perry during her trip as achievements. \"I didn't go to the States for pictures or hats. I came with firm commitments and projections for the country,\" she said, in a dig at Iohannis.\n\nUSR-Plus candidate Barna, meanwhile, went to the U.S. to participate in an annual forum of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a research institute.\n\n\"It wasn't a visit meant for photo opportunities,\" Barna told POLITICO over the phone, adding that he met people from the U.S. State Department and Congress, as well as think tanks influential in defining U.S. policy toward Europe and Romania.\n\nAs for voters back home, Barna said that his U.S. visit matters because \"people want to know that they have candidates who are capable of engaging in credible dialogue, capable of interacting with other Romanian partners, especially with the United States being a strategic partner for Romania together with the European Union.\"\n\nBut for political consultant Magdin, the presidential candidates' pilgrimage to the U.S. matters more in the candidates' own minds than in the polls.\n\n\"I don't think any sociologist can say that after Iohannis received the MRGA hat, he went up in the polls,\" he said.", "description": "Trips are meant to show voters back home that the candidate has access to top US officials.", "authors": ["Carmen Paun", "Florian Eder"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1171027926-1200x628.jpg"}
