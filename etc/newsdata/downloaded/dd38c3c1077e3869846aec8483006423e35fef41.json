We will fight for all Canadians.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister broke tradition by delivering his remarks while Mr Scheer was addressing his supporters, rather than waiting for the Conservative leader to conclude his speech.", "description": "Justin Trudeau has won re-election, but without a parliamentary majority after a close-run race in which the Canadian prime minister faced several scandals.", "authors": ["Christopher Guly", "Eilis O'Hanlon", "Owen Paterson", "Stewart Jackson"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y0hBtg4LuQI/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
