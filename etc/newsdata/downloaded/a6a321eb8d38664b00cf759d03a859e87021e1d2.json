Vermont, he believes, has a fair system, which requires \u201cspecific facts\u201d that show \u201can imminent and extreme risk.\u201d\n\nThe situation becomes even more precarious when loved ones can petition for the removal of firearms, he said. Spurned former partners or family members seeking revenge might \u201cweaponize\u201d this tool, he said. Because of that, he argues, there should be a penalty for maliciously false accusations, which several states have adopted.\n\nBut New York state Sen. Brian Kavanagh, a Democrat and the author of the state\u2019s red flag law that went into effect last month, said family members and former partners are most likely to have evidence and an urgent need for safety.
