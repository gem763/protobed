Waves reaching up to 14 metres (46 feet) in height knocked out the plant\u2019s backup power supply, causing fuel inside the reactors to melt.\n\nProsecutors had argued that Katsumata, Muto and Takekuro should have understood the risk a huge tsunami posed and had failed to take necessary safety measures.\n\nThe men were present at meetings where experts warned of the threat posed by large tsunamis off the Fukushima coast and had access to data and warning that a tsunami exceeding 10m (33ft) could trigger power loss and a major disaster at the plant.\n\nIn addition, a Tepco internal study, based on a 2002 report by a respected government panel, concluded that a wave of up to 15.7m (52ft) could strike after a magnitude-8.3 quake. The earthquake that triggered the March 2011 tsunami was recorded as magnitude-9.0.\n\nThe tsunami killed more than 18,000 people along Japan\u2019s north-east coast, including Fukushima. The nuclear meltdown sent plumes of radiation into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of 160,000 people living near the plant, some of whom are still unable to return to their homes.\n\nTepco has said it will take 40 years to locate and remove the melted fuel from the reactor cores, although some experts believe decommissioning could take longer.\n\nThe government has estimated that the total cost of dismantling the plant, decontaminating surrounding areas and compensating victims at about $200bn.\n\nThe embattled utility is soon expected to decide the fate of more than a million tonnes of contaminated water stored at the site.\n\nThe most likely option \u2013 discharging the water in the Pacific ocean \u2013 is strongly opposed by local fishermen who have spent that last eight years rebuilding their industry.\n\nInitially it appeared unlikely that the executives would ever face criminal proceedings. Prosecutors twice declined to proceed with the case, citing a lack of evidence and slim odds for a conviction.\n\nThe case went to court, however, after a judicial review panel comprising ordinary citizens ruled in 2015 that the three men should face trial.\n\nHiroyuki Kawai, a lawyer representing more than 5,700 Fukushima residents who filed the criminal complaint against the former executives, said before the ruling that he expected the legal battle to last about a decade because the losing side would appeal.\n\n\u201cThis is only the beginning of a major battle,\u201d he said at a rally. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to eradicate dangerous nuclear plants that have thrown many residents into despair.\u201d", "description": "Three executives at Tepco acquitted, marking the end of the only criminal action over the disaster", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a487ed1eb543de318be1c280fbd9d87247a47415/312_0_2876_1728/master/2876.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cbd54ebee67ac37b98d1e949a71444f3", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
