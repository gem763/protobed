It\u2019s a right for everyone,\u201d the former Texas congressman tweeted Monday evening.\n\nThe Democrat\u2019s tweet also included a video further explaining his position.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the tough thing to talk about, though we must. Rich people are gonna have to allow \u2014 or be forced to allow \u2014 lower-income people to live near them, which is what we fail to do in this country right now,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke says in the campaign clip.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke then claims lower-income Americans must drive \u201cone, two, three hours in either direction to get to their jobs, very often minimum wage jobs, so they\u2019re working two or three of them right now.\u201d\n\nThe candidate offers high-speed rail and transit as an initiative to \u201cmake sure that if you do not have a car, do not want to use a car you will not need to have one, or you will not be penalized for not having one right now.\u201d\n\nTimothy Meads, a writer for the conservative website Townhall, blasted the alleged \u201cright\u201d and Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pitch to potential voters.\n\n\u201cBeto continues to show that the new platform of the left simply means free stuff,\u201d Mr. Meads wrote Tuesday. His idea of a \u2018right\u2019 is not based in natural law, but in whatever sounds good at the time.\u201d\n\nLiving close to work shouldn\u2019t be a luxury for the rich. It\u2019s a right for everyone. pic.twitter.com/lohRdoFGrH \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 10, 2019\n\n\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
