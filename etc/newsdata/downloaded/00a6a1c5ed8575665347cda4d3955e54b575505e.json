This Real-Life Police Officer Knows", "language": "en", "text": "In finally showing what happened to Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), \u201cEl Camino\u201d tied up major loose ends from \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d But the show\u2019s epilogue also left us with more questions, perhaps most notably: What the heck happened to Skinny Pete?\n\nIn \u201cEl Camino,\u201d Skinny Pete (Charles Baker) helps Jesse by giving him a replacement ride for his stolen El Camino just before the cops arrive. Jesse manages to get away as a line of police cars head toward Pete\u2019s house, but we never get to see what happens.\n\nTo get to the bottom of this, we enlisted the help of a real-life criminal investigator, Albuquerque police officer Simon Drobik.\n\nOn the first day that \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d started filming in Albuquerque, Drobik and his police department were there to shut down the streets for production, he told HuffPost. All these years later, he was recruited by series creator Vince Gilligan to serve as a police adviser on \u201cEl Camino.\u201d Drobik has also made appearances in \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and the new movie, showing up as one of the police responders at Ed\u2019s (Robert Forster) vacuum store:\n\nNetflix Simon Drobik in \"El Camino.\"\n\nDrobik was asked to choreograph the \u201cEl Camino\u201d police scenes to make sure they felt authentic and, in doing so, he told us there was a deleted scene explaining what really happened to Skinny Pete.\n\n\u201cWe did a really good SWAT scene when we hit Skinny Pete\u2019s house. I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be on the extras at some point, but it just didn\u2019t make the cut because they were just trying to crunch it down,\u201d Drobik said. \u201cWe choreographed a SWAT team of them entering and arresting Skinny Pete. Basically, when he\u2019s out there with the El Camino waiting for the cops to show up, the next moment would be showing up and hitting his house with the SWAT team.\u201d\n\nYou can see part of the aftermath of the scene in one of the trailers as Skinny Pete gets interrogated by police.\n\n\u201cHe would have definitely been interviewed,\u201d Drobik added. \u201cThe trailer had him being interviewed, so it did allude to him being taken into custody. But Skinny Pete, being the faithful dude that he is, he just plays the part \u2015 doesn\u2019t give up the goods.\u201d\n\nSo what happened to Pete? Drobik said he faced much more than an interrogation.\n\n\u201cHe had a stolen car on his property, and I think he took the fall for that. So he\u2019d be looking at a felony receiving and transferring of a stolen motor vehicle. I\u2019m sure Skinny Pete would\u2019ve done some time,\u201d the officer said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not hard for him because of his background.\u201d\n\nBesides giving us the skinny on Pete, Drobik also pointed out some of the details that were added to make \u201cEl Camino\u201d look realistic.\n\nThe line of cops headed to Skinny Pete\u2019s house could be a real-world response.\n\nNetflix Scene from \"El Camino.\"\n\n\u201cVince wanted something really intense, and you kind of feel that, like, \u2018Oh man, is he about to get popped?\u2019\u201d Drobik said of the line of police cars passing Jesse.\n\nIf the events in the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d finale happened in real life, they might actually elicit that type of all-hands-on-deck response, the officer said.\n\n\u201cIf something were to happen that ... that type of shooting, the whole city\u2019s really going to start showing up,\u201d he said.\n\nCars do get dumped hundreds of miles away to throw off police.\n\nNetflix Badger on his way to throw police off the scent.\n\nIn the movie, Badger (Matt Jones) attempts to leave Skinny Pete\u2019s car near the Mexican border, trying to convince police that Jesse had driven south in it to escape. Drobik called that detail a \u201cbrilliant\u201d addition by Gilligan.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true life stuff,\u201d Drobik said. \u201cThat does happen. Cars get stashed in places. Where we find them ... we get the prints, we dust it, try to figure out where it\u2019s from, and putting all the pieces together.\u201d\n\nIf you look closely, Todd\u2019s apartment shows signs that it\u2019s been thoroughly searched.\n\nNetflix Jesse Pinkman arrives at Todd's apartment in \"El Camino.\"\n\nBecause the police search Todd\u2019s (Jesse Plemons) apartment before Jesse arrives in \u201cEl Camino,\u201d Drobik said a lot of care was taken to stage it as if the cops had actually been there.\n\n\u201cThe warrant\u2019s up on the door ... you can\u2019t really see it, but there\u2019s detailed stuff where the warrants are on the table,\u201d Drobik said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fingerprint dust. For narcotics guys, we look really hard, so we removed all the plates from the walls to see if there\u2019s trap doors.\u201d\n\nThose were real cops posted outside the Pinkman house.\n\nNetflix Mr. and Mrs. Pinkman (Tess Harper and Michael Bofshever) receive a call from Jesse in \"El Camino.\"\n\nIn order to take some guns from his parents\u2019 house, Jesse draws them away, pretending that he needs his mom and dad to pick him up so he can turn himself in. When they leave, presumably undercover officers trail behind them.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re looking for a suspect, we\u2019re going to go to his girlfriend\u2019s house and mom\u2019s house, see if he shows up. Most people return to what they know,\u201d Drobik said.\n\nBut not all the officers left the house. To make it more authentic, Drobik said the officers still stationed outside the Pinkman house were actual police officers.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to detail, they wanted cops who could walk the walk and talk the talk, hold guns right and look the part,\u201d Drobik said. \u201cIt\u2019s so incredibly detailed behind the scenes of every single shot, like they really do their homework and really know what they want. They just don\u2019t want some random guy in there pretending. They want the real thing.\u201d", "description": "And other behind-the-scenes secrets from cop Simon Drobik, who also stars in the \"Breaking Bad\" sequel.", "authors": ["Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da70b48210000150e34a1b7.png?cache=sjgqa8yysn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
