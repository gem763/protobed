The work you [The Telegraph] are doing in terms of really putting women and girls front and centre is so important in terms of sending messages that sport is an OK place to be, and that women will be encouraged and welcomed. There\u2019s an attitude shift among women themselves and also the people delivering sport.\u201d", "description": "Netball, cycling, weights and interval training are among the activities which have driven a surge of a quarter of a million more women to become active over the past year.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/netball/2019/07/05/TELEMMGLPICT000183573831-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJKshGvN1om7Aqkp8aAKZGV206ZC705r5ZExmQGWsJ7I.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
