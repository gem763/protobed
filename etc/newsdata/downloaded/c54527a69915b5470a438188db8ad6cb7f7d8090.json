And those candidates, in turn, brought some of the most cringe-inducing lines of this presidential cycle.\n\nWhile politicians are rarely without a corny zinger at the ready, Thursday\u2019s debate appeared more chock full of them than normal. Here are some of the buzziest \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 one-liners of the third debate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n\nAndrew Yang pokes fun at his ethnicity\n\nYang made clear he's fine with self-deprecating humor in an exchange about his insights into the health care system.\n\n\u201cNow, I am Asian, so, I know a lot of doctors,\u201d he said, going on to say that the doctors he knew complained about the bureaucracy of the current system.\n\n\n\nJoe Biden appeals to ... vinyl lovers?\n\nIn one viral exchange about education, Biden suggested a novel idea to help students from less affluent areas.\n\n\u201cPlay the radio, make sure the television \u2014 the, excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time we get there.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmy Klobuchar nods to the local crowd\n\nIn her opening statement, Klobuchar gave a shout out to the debate's host city of Houston and its NASA roots.\n\n\u201cNow, I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we've already got that in the white house. Houston, we have a problem.\u201d\n\n\n\nCory Booker makes a bald joke\n\nBooker took issue with President Donald Trump's decision to pick trade wars with U.S. allies, which the president has defended as a way to address national security threats.\n\n\u201cYou literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada,\" he said. \"I'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/3c/04/c54344d143aca2f92f3db8181af0/kamala-wizardoz.png\"\n\nKamala Harris misfires with a \u2018Wizard of Oz\u2019 joke\n\nHarris pulled out a peculiar reference when discussing her gripes about Trump's trade policies.\n\n\"But the bottom line is this: Donald Trump, in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in 'The Wizard of Oz,' when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude?\" she asked.\n\nModerator George Stephanopolous, who is 5'5\", did not appear amused by the question. \"OK, I'm not even going to take the bait, Senator Harris,\u201d he responded.\n\n\n\nCastro invokes Biden's gaffes\n\nCastro challenged the former vice president on his health care plan, and appeared to allude to a string of recent misstatements from Biden on the campaign trail.\n\n\"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2607/1155968404_6085815684001_6085813667001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nBiden takes his own shot at Castro\n\nDuring the same exchange over the legacy of Obamacare, Castro asserted that his health care plan would insure more than Biden's, therefore building more off Obama's signature achievement.\n\n\"I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you're not,\" Castro said.\n\n\"That will be a surprise to him,\" Biden retorted.\n\n\n\nKlobuchar swoops in to play peacemaker\n\nAfter a clash broke out between several candidates on stage, Klobuchar stepped in and invoked Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\u201cYeah, but a house divided cannot stand. And that is not how we're going to win this.\u201d\n\n\n\nKamala Harris turns an Obama-Biden slogan back on Biden\n\nDuring an exchange about executive orders, Harris knocked Biden for being pessimistic.\n\n\u201cI would just say: Hey Joe, instead of saying no, we can't, let's say yes, we can.\u201d\n\n\n\nBooker gets blunt about his veganism\n\nAsked by moderator Jorge Ramos about whether Booker would encourage Americans to adopt his vegan diet to fight climate change, the New Jersey senator appeared genuinely surprised by the question.\n\n\u201cUm, you know, first of all, I want to say: No. Actually I want to translate that into Spanish: No,\u201d he responded.\n\n\n\n\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/bf/a5/ee39e398492497db7b2524311ac6/harris.png\"\n\nHarris speaks to an audience of one\n\nIn her opening statement, Harris spoke directly to the president, who she said she knew was likely watching. At that moment, however, Trump was delivering a speech to congressional Republicans at their annual retreat.\n\n\u201cI plan on focusing on our common issues, common hopes and desires and in that way, unifying our country, winning this election and turning the page for America,\" Harris said. \"And now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden takes a dig at the Democratic socialist on stage\n\nDuring a debate over differences in Biden's and Sanders' health care plans, Biden knocked Sanders' roots as a Democratic socialist.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you something. For a socialist, you have a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\u201d\n\n\n\nBooker gets retrospective about his biggest setback\n\nWhile explaining his past electoral failures in his closing statement, Booker went off on a bit of a tangent to gripe about the documentary made about one of the aforementioned failures.\n\n\u201cHere's a bit of advice to everybody. If you're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for an Oscar-nominated documentary called 'Streetfight,'\" he said. \"But then unfortunately, another setback, it lost in the Oscars to a movie called March of the daggum Penguins for crying out loud!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/fa/e8/21d18cd6444381da60a72dfbfc4d/yang-buttigieg.png\"\n\nPete Buttigieg has to follow Andrew Yang\u2019s $120,000 opening statement\n\n\u201cIt's original, I'll give you that.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Thursday\u2019s debate appeared more chock full of them than normal.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/41/5f/d3b181134f4f9e48faa0c83d1109/cringeworthy.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
