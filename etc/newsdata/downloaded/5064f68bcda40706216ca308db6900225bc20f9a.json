The situation is simply unacceptable.\n\nBut while the immediate impact on our bank balances is fairly clear, and resolution equally straightforward, the hidden, long-term problems could have far greater effects on our financial lives.\n\nThese outages can mean scheduled payments don\u2019t go through or that consumers can\u2019t access their accounts to make payments, which can have a negative impact on their credit report. This can damage their ability to be accepted for financial products in future, like a mobile phone contract or even a mortgage. It could mean they only have access to higher interest rates, which increases the cost of credit.\n\nA missed payment can be one of the most negative factors on your credit report, and multiple missed payments can lead to a default \u2013 the most damaging factor possible, warns ClearScore.\n\nA missed payment might also have further negative consequences \u2013 for example, if the late payment fees incurred from the missed payment took you over your agreed credit limit, this would damage your credit score even further.\n\n\u201cIt might take several weeks for a missed payment to show up on your credit report so many only found out they\u2019ve been a victim when they\u2019re turned down for a financial product like a mobile phone contract or a mortgage,\u201d warns Justin Basini, chief executive and co-founder of ClearScore.\n\nTwo-thirds of consumers who have checked their credit report after a bank IT failure have uncovered errors that could affect their creditworthiness, including missed payments that weren\u2019t their fault, the credit checking service has found, but only a quarter of those whose bank had a major IT outage checked their report for errors.\n\nHow to fix credit report mistakes fast\n\n1. Talk to the company\n\nIf you spot a mistake, let the company or lender know. They may well be happy to amend it immediately or you may need to go through their official complaints procedure.\n\nEither way, they should send updates to all the credit reference agencies they use, so you won\u2019t have to submit a request to each individual agency.\n\n2. Talk to the credit report provider\n\nYour credit score belongs to you and you have a right to make sure it\u2019s accurate.\n\nAll credit scoring agencies should have a process for putting mistakes right so a few minutes of proactive emailing could fix the issue fast.\n\n3. What if the company doesn\u2019t agree?\n\nIf you believe there\u2019s an error on your report but you can\u2019t get it fixed, then you can add a Notice of Correction to your file.\n\nA Notice of Correction is essentially up to 200 words explaining what happened and why it doesn\u2019t reflect your normal financial behaviour. That\u2019s not necessarily just for bank errors, it can also be used to explain any negative marks on your score.\n\nSo, if you had a period of ill health, for example, which means you fell behind on your bills, you can leave a note to explain.", "description": "As a basic rule, if you entrust your money to a bank or building society, you should be able to get to it.
