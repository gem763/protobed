Tactically, mentally, physically, they tore them to shreds.\"\n\nEngland's players and coaching staff, however, were avoiding the euphoria, well aware that defeat to South Africa or Wales in next weekend's final would put an entirely different complexion on Saturday's victory.\n\n\"Going into the game, building up to it, we felt in control of what we're doing and that comes from our preparation,\" said captain Owen Farrell. \"The work that we put in in the week - you can't fake that when you're out there in a big test match.\"\n\nFlanker Sam Underhill, who was again superb in forcing the All Blacks onto the back foot at the breakdown, said: \"You have to celebrate your wins but we still have our feet on the ground. It's not something we're going to get carried away with.\n\n\"We've spoken over the eight weeks about taking every day as it comes and not looking too far ahead and that's what we have managed so far. For us, it's just going to be a case of same again.\"\n\nHis similarly impressive flanker partner Tom Curry was equally grounded. \"You have to take the occasion in and not let it pass you by but control is massive to our game and we have to make sure we deliver that again,\" said the 21-year-old. \"The World Cup is such a fast-moving pace we have to shift our focus quickly onto South Africa or Wales.\"\n\nLock Maro Itoje, man of the match after another performance of astonishing energy, was also not about to sit on his laurels.\n\n\"I think I can be more engaged in the game, be more in the moment,\" he said of his own contribution. \"I think if I do that, hopefully I can still improve a little bit.\"\n\nJones, who lost the 2003 final to England when coach of Australia, declined to be drawn to comparing the performance and was fully focused on the one remaining step.\n\n\"We're not historians, we don't know, but we know we can play better next week,\" he said when asked where Saturday's match ranked.\n\n\"We wanted to be the best team in the world and we're not yet. But now we've got an opportunity to play in a game where we could be.\" (Editing by Lincoln Feast.)", "description": "Rugby-England already moving on from performance of a lifetime", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_6_800x533_L_1412601562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
