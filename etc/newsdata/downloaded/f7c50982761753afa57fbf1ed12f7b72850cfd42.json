Tens of thousands of store workers will have to be trained how to request that customers not openly carry their weapons into the stores.\n\nA Walmart spokesman said employees would be taking a \u201cnonconfrontational\u201d approach in carrying out the new policy, but that the stores were willing to contact law enforcement if a customer became disruptive. Walmart will eventually start posting signs around stores outlining the rule.\n\nIn making its decision to discourage open carry in its stores, Mr. McMillon cited \u201cmultiple incidents since El Paso, where individuals attempting to make a statement and test our response have entered our stores carrying weapons in a way that frightened or concerned our associates and customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese incidents are concerning and we would like to avoid them,\u201d he added in his statement.\n\nThe company said it took time to research the changes, which come exactly one month after the El Paso shooting, and devise training for employees.\n\nWalmart described its new limits on ammunition sales as \u201cdramatic.\u201d The decision is expected to reduce the company\u2019s share of the nation\u2019s ammunition market to as low as 6 percent, from 20 percent. The company said last month that it accounted for about 2 percent of the nation\u2019s firearm sales.\n\nThe retailer said it was also ending the sale of handguns in Alaska, the only state where the company still sells them. Walmart stopped selling handguns in every other state in the 1990s, but continued to sell handgun ammunition across the country.", "description": "After 22 people were killed at an El Paso store on Aug. 3, the nation\u2019s largest retailer said it would stop selling ammunition for certain short barrel rifles and for all handguns.", "authors": ["Michael Corkery"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/business/03Walmartguns-promo/03Walmartguns-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"}
