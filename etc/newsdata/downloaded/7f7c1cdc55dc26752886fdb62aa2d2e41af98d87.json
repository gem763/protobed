Mike Cannon-Brookes\n\nThe most recognisable face of the growing local tech scene, Cannon-Brookes\u2019 star has continued to rise throughout 2019. Atlassian\u2019s value is about $43 billion, and he somehow manages to find time to be one of the most politically vocal CEOs in Australia.\n\nLate 2018 he took on Prime Minister Scott Morrison over the use of the words \u201cfair dinkum power,\u201d whipping up a high-profile campaign to develop a national energy policy that could be \u201cclean, cheap, reliable and Australian\u201d.\n\nAside from Atlassian and the energy debate, he is on an elite panel of CEOs pulled together by Fortescue chief Andrew Forrest to sell Australia as a global brand, and is established as one of the country\u2019s most active investors in the next generation of technology start-ups.\n\n2. Scott Farquhar\n\nFarquhar attracts fewer headlines than his Atlassian co-founder, but his own influence on the broader technology scene is similarly profound.\n\nHis success in building Atlassian has translated into a reputation for being able to get results, and he has been a key figure in making governments reconsider how they plan capital cities to incorporate tech hubs for growing companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also led the local tech industry in calling for reform to immigration laws, which had been tightened to the extent that companies said the lack of available talent was preventing growth. New fast-tracked visas for the best overseas talent, announced in August, were heavily influenced by the public stance taken by Farquhar.\n\n3. Karen Andrews\n\nIt is probably fair to say that reviving the government\u2019s Innovation Agenda was not a challenge the Industry, Science and Technology Minister thought she would need to worry about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s surprise election win has seen Andrews working fast to build bridges with the local technology sector, which felt excluded from important policy decisions related to research and development tax incentives and data encryption laws in the last term of government.\n\nShe has held talks with leaders from Australia\u2019s start-up sector and the local operations of big global tech players, and pledged to install a new digital economy and technology division in her department, to take the lead in setting policy correctly to grow a bigger local industry.\n\n4. Rod Sims\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman basked in the global tech spotlight in late 2018 and again in August with the release of the ACCC\u2019s exhaustive report into the power of technology platforms like Google and Facebook in Australia.\n\nThis was a significant effort, with the report proposing numerous potential legislated requirements to try and level the playing field with traditional media companies in particular.\n\nIt remains to be seen how strong the government\u2019s final responses are, but Sims has the world\u2019s biggest players on notice that the ACCC is mulling how to enforce competition law to curtail their power.\n\nElsewhere the ACCC\u2019s intervention to block the $15 billion merger of Vodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom is an industry-shaping call that, at the time of printing, has still to reach a conclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Melanie Silva\n\nIt has been a big year for the long-time Google executive, who stepped up as managing director of Australian and New Zealand operations last September. She has piloted the company through a year of internal troubles, which included a staff walkout over the handling of sexual harrassment cases globally, in her first weeks in the job.\n\nHowever Silva has emerged with an enhanced reputation for negotiation and leadership, having represented the company throughout the process of the ACCC\u2019s draft and final reports into Google\u2019s wielding of market power.\n\nGoogle employs more than 1600 people across Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland, and it has signed a string of local deals, including one in August for YouTube to broadcast the annual ARIA music awards.\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.
