They\u2019re both 12, struggling to adjust here, pining for what they can see only in their dreams.\n\n\u201cThe cows, goats and sheep,\u201d said Hamsa, a daughter of Fulani herders.\n\n\u201cOur house made of stone,\u201d said Mariam, a daughter of Dogon farmers.\n\nTheir families escaped to neighboring camps this spring after gunmen stormed their rural villages in central Mali, spraying bullets into bedrooms and torching grain huts. Their people had shared that land in a fragile peace for decades before the terrorists invaded, setting off a surge of violence between the two communities.\n\nIslamist militants who once tried to conquer Mali by force are striking again with an insidious new strategy, security analysts say: Fighters linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State are provoking feuds between old neighbors \u2014 the Fulani and the Dogon \u2014 and gaining ground by offering to protect victims of the conflict they\u2019re stoking. Now a record number of people are fleeing their homes in this West African nation twice the size of Texas.\n\n\n\nThe Mopti region of Mali. (Jane Hahn for The Washington Post)\n\nThe extremist groups \u201cbroke down systems that usually deal with intercommunity violence,\u201d said Dennis Hankins, U.S. ambassador to Mali.\n\nChaos has spilled south into countries previously unshaken by terrorism, including Burkina Faso and Benin, and threatens to turn a growing swath of West Africa into a refuge for Islamist groups who have lost territory in Syria and Iraq and aim to rouse followers elsewhere.\n\nMali has sent a third of its armed forces into the restive Mopti region, where they\u2019re backed by soldiers from France and the United Nations, as well as American intelligence and logistics. The battle fought on some of the world\u2019s harshest terrain shows no sign of abating, experts say, as extremists appeal to communities in need by claiming they can offer services the government has failed to supply.\n\nMalians who flee to Sevare, a dusty garrison town in Mopti, divide into camps by ethnic group. But inside those concrete walls, common sentiments emerge: People say they don\u2019t actually hate their neighbors. They\u2019re not sure how this happened \u2014 how dormant tensions could explode into massacres.\n\nLike many from both communities, two girls in plastic tents are gripped by the same desire.\n\n\u201cI really miss my village,\u201d said soft-spoken Hamsa, who lives in the Fulani camp, where she busies herself with the French alphabet.\n\n\u201cI hope we can return soon,\u201d said chatty Mariam, who lives on the Dogon side and prefers numbers.\n\nHamsa lives in the Fulani camp, where she focuses on school and busies herself with the French alphabet.

(Photos by Jane Hahn for The Washington Post)\n\nThe fighting that upended their lives has killed 817 civilians since January, up from about 574 in the previous year, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. Between January and June, 150 children were killed, per U.N. figures.\n\nAnd at least 140,000 people have been forced from their homes this year, according to a September report from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center \u2014 a nearly sevenfold upswing over the past 12 months.\n\nAmong them are the Dogon, who hunt, farm and practice a mix of religions in central Mali, and the Fulani, who are primarily Muslim and herd cattle across West Africa. The groups have tangled over the years, especially as climate change has shrunk fertile land.\n\nTensions boiled over in March when gunmen surrounded a Fulani village, setting dwellings ablaze and killing nearly 160 people. Then an ambush on a Dogon community in June claimed dozens more lives.\n\nLeaders from both ethnic groups have denied involvement in the attacks, which followed smaller bursts of tit-for-tat violence, but villagers from both sides said in interviews they were certain the other was responsible. They criticized the military for failing to shield them. (The government has said it lacks the resources to patrol the vast countryside.)\n\nFueling the fight was an enemy in the shadows, according to Western officials and security analysts. Unknown gunmen have targeted Dogon chiefs and Fulani imams in recent years, eliminating leaders who had negotiated harmony between the ethnic groups for generations.\n\nThe al-Qaeda branch JNIM and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara publicly urged the Fulani to join their ranks for protection, sparking accusations the herders were harboring terrorists.\n\nThe Fulani denied the claim and accused the Malian military of arming Dogon hunters to destroy them.\n\nAmid the confusion, no one was there to help Hamsa and Mariam when the conflict reached their doorsteps. Both families fled in March, unsure of where they were going. Both girls have nightmares. Both lost relatives.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents,\u201d the Fulani daughter said.\n\n\u201cMy uncle,\u201d the Dogon daughter said.\n\n\n\nA young boy sits in the doorway of a tent during a storm. (Jane Hahn for The Washington Post)\n\nA devastating chain reaction\n\nThe story of how Hamsa and Mariam found themselves in neighboring settlements starts eight years ago and 1,400 miles northeast with the fall of the Libyan government.\n\nMercenaries once employed by Moammar Gaddafi flooded back to their native Mali in 2011 with machine guns and grenades, unleashing a devastating chain reaction.\n\nSome of these ethnic Tuareg rebels forged a shaky partnership with Islamist militants in a quest to claim Mali\u2019s north, which failed after France stepped in. (The rebels signed a peace agreement with the government in 2015.)\n\nBut terrorism is a stubborn menace. It crept to Mali\u2019s more populated center. Extremist leaders weakened in the Middle East called on Africans to take up the fight.\n\n\u201cFrom [Afghanistan] to Iraq to Yemen, to Somalia to western and central Africa,\u201d Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said in a recording released in September. \u201cSacrifice your lives if you have to.\u201d\n\nThis cause is tempting to some young men, who analysts say have grown desperate for food in recent years as opportunity dried up in Mali\u2019s center and the government focused on securing the capital city, Bamako, about 400 miles southwest.\n\nAt least 140,000 people have been forced from their homes this year because of the fighting, according to a September report. Mariam, 12, and her mother, Aissata Toulema, 44, stand outside their family's tent.

Herders couldn\u2019t move livestock, and farmers couldn\u2019t sell crops.\n\nMali became \u201ca haven for many terror groups to stage and launch attacks across the region,\u201d Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, former head of the United States Africa Command, said in a February speech.\n\nTourism dried up in the region known for historical mosques, camping under the stars, dwellings carved into sandstone cliffs and a celebrated music scene. (Bono performed at a Timbuktu festival with Malian group Tinariwen in 2012.)\n\nNow foreign governments warn tourists to avoid Mali. \u201cDo not travel,\u201d reads the U.S. State Department\u2019s advisory, and if you do: \u201cDraft a will.\u201d\n\nUnder mounting pressure, former prime minister Soumeylou Boub\u00e8ye Ma\u00efga and his entire government resigned in April.\n\n\n\nA woman speaks to a man on a boat at a harbor on the Niger River, a major lifeline for the country. (Jane Hahn for The Washington Post)\n\nHis replacement, Boubou Cisse, ordered roughly 15,000 troops to the country\u2019s center this spring in response to the escalating bloodshed. (His predecessor said Mali lacked the manpower to stop the conflict, but critics accuse the country\u2019s leaders of taking too long to integrate former Tuareg rebels into their forces after repelling the takeover.)\n\nViolence spiked again Oct. 1 when extremists ambushed two army outposts, killing 25 soldiers and stealing their equipment.\n\nAnd people in makeshift camps wonder when they can go home.\n\nTwo girls. Same confusion.\n\nHamsa, the daughter of Fulani herders, misses the clay.\n\nShe used to dig for beige earth after a downpour and sculpt little families of cows.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to find at her camp, which UNICEF runs with the Malian government. About 150 people from her ethnic group share a space the size of a football field. Sheep graze around their tents \u2014 reminders of home.\n\nA bus took her 74 miles to Sevare, which has a military base, a bar named after Facebook, a photo studio and some 40,000 people trying to carry on as normal.\n\nExtremists bombed a regional counterterrorism headquarters here last summer, and last month a bus hit a land mine outside town, killing 14. (The al-Qaeda branch JNIM released a rare apology on social media \u2014 it was intended, they said, for French soldiers.)\n\n\u201cI had a lot of freedom,\u201d Hamsa says. On slow afternoons, Mariam thinks of her mare \u2014 a gray beauty with white spots. (Photos by Jane Hahn for The Washington Post)\n\nLEFT: \u201cI had a lot of freedom,\u201d Hamsa says.

(Photos by Jane Hahn for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say what brought us here,\u201d said Hamsa\u2019s father, Drissa Bolly. \u201cI\u2019d never in my life experienced ethnic violence. I don\u2019t know who did this.\u201d\n\nAcross town, Mariam, the daughter of Dogon farmers, hears similar confusion from her mother.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a misunderstanding between communities,\u201d Aissata Toupema said. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d\n\nBoth families fled when gunfire rang out in the dark. Neither saw the attackers. Just buildings on fire.\n\nBoth hunkered inside their tents on a recent Tuesday as a sandstorm blasted Sevare. They packed together with new roommates, waiting for the sky to clear.\n\nOn these slow afternoons, Mariam thinks of her mare \u2014 a gray beauty with white spots. She misses brushing the horse, who didn\u2019t have a name. There\u2019s only a stray dog here.\n\nHamsa tries to focus on school. Teachers help her recite French letters. (Mariam looks forward to math class.)\n\nNeither knows anything about the terrorists.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of freedom,\u201d Hamsa said.\n\n\u201cI pray we can find peace,\u201d Mariam said.", "description": "Extremists once tried to conquer Mali by force.
