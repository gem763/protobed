Coaches worked together for four years on Washington Redskins\u2019 staff. McVay is 3-1 against his friend, with Rams\u2018 only loss coming while resting all starters late in 2017 season. \u2026 McVay\u2019s 27-10 record matches San Francisco\u2019s Jim Harbaugh for best mark through 37 games for all coaches hired in 21st century. \u2026 Rams dropped 87 points while sweeping 49ers last season, most they\u2019ve scored against one opponent in single year since 1996. \u2026 Niners off to first 4-0 start since 1990. Only 5-0 starts for franchise since joining NFL are 1990, 1984, 1952. \u2026 San Francisco scored TD on first possession of second half in all four games this season. \u2026 Niners topped 400 yards of offense in three straight games for first time since 2003. SF last had four-game streak when did it five in row in 1998. \u2026 San Francisco ran for 275 yards vs. Cleveland, most in game since 355 vs. Chargers in 2014. Niners lead NFL with 200 yards rushing per game. \u2026 49ers allowed 180 yards last week, fewest in game since Dec. 3, 2017 vs. Bears. \u2026 San Francisco has allowed league-low four sacks. \u2026 K Robbie Gould missed three FGs last week and five this season after making 72 of 75 in first two seasons with 49ers. \u2026 San Francisco started league-best 11 drives in opposing territory\u2026 Bay Area native Jared Goff of Rams is third in NFL with 1,649 yards passing, but seven TDs and seven interceptions. \u2026 Todd Gurley ranks 18th in NFL with 270 yards rushing. Could be limited by thigh bruise this week, possibly putting spotlight on backup Malcolm Brown. \u2026 Aaron Donald has seven sacks in last four meetings with Niners. \u2026 K Greg Zuerlein has three missed FGs inside 50 yards this season. Only missed four FGs inside 50 in previous three seasons combined. \u2026 Rams sacks leader Clay Matthews will miss game with broken jaw. \u2026 Rams are only team with three receivers with 325 yards receiving: Cooper Kupp, Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods. Kupp is second in NFL with 41 catches, and ranks fourth with 505 yards and four TDs. \u2026 Fantasy tip: Although Niners\u2019 defense is tough, Goff is often a good play against team he grew up rooting for. He has thrown nine TD passes, no interceptions in last three meetings with Niners.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (4-0) at LOS ANGELES RAMS (3-2)", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
