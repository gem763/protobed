Atlanta and Philadelphia have also been on the receiving end of the Republican\u2019s scorn.\n\nYesterday, it was apparently Chicago\u2019s turn. The Associated Press reported:\n\nVisiting Chicago for the first time as president, Donald Trump disparaged the city Monday as a haven for criminals that is \u201cembarrassing to us as a nation.\u201d The city\u2019s top cop sat out Trump\u2019s speech to protest the president\u2019s immigration policies and frequently divisive rhetoric.\n\nAccording to the official transcript, the president told the International Association of Chiefs of Police Annual Conference, \u201cAll over the world, they\u2019re talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison. It\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nIf pressed, I imagine Trump could tell us all about the imagined conversations he\u2019s had with people from around the globe, many of whom marveled at Chicago\u2019s crime rate. The stories would no doubt feature a lot of people who repeatedly used the word \u201csir\u201d and were crying during their conversations with the president.\n\nBut putting that aside, what amazes is just how frequently the American president takes aim at communities in his own country.\n\nThere\u2019s a strain of conservative thought that insists that the left is made up of snobs who think they\u2019re superior \u2013 culturally, intellectually \u2013 to people who live outside of metropolitan areas. I\u2019ve long found the complaints unpersuasive, but I\u2019ve lost count of how many far-right events I\u2019ve covered in which speakers have told audiences, \u201cThese liberals think they\u2019re better than you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that the Republican president has spent a fair amount of time denouncing urban areas \u2013 places with large minority populations and home to many immigrants \u2013 with scorn and contempt. As Trump put it yesterday, he considers major American cities like Chicago to be \u201cembarrassing\u201d to the country.\n\nThe political inverse is unfathomable. Imagine a Democratic president condemning a deep-red state \u2013 in the South, in the Plains, wherever \u2013 as being an international embarrassment. He or she would face widespread criticisms, not just for disparaging his or her own constituents, but for demonstrating an ugly elitism.\n\nAnd yet Trump routinely blasts American cities he doesn\u2019t like \u2013 which is to say, parts of the country that didn\u2019t vote for him \u2013 as deserving of his disdain.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to occur to the president that he represents the whole country, not just the parts filled with people he considers political allies.", "description": "It's rare to see an American president so cavalier about condemning parts of his own country he doesn't like.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/465237708.jpg?itok=STqb7Bzs", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
