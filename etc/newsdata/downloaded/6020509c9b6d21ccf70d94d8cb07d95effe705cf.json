I was in its pension scheme and also contributed to a linked Additional Voluntary Contribution plan.\n\nEarly this year, I contacted Aviva but was told the trust deed was lost. This is not my problem, but Aviva declines to let me access my own money.\n\nThe plot thickens: 'Aviva has not lost the trust deed for the pension plan. I doubt if it would have had it in the first place', Tony Hetherington says\n\nThe partnership that employed you went out of business in 2003. You transferred your entitlement under its pension scheme to a different company, and that is not a problem, but you left your AVC savings with Aviva \u2013 and this is where things get complicated.\n\nAviva has not lost the trust deed for the pension plan. I doubt if it would have had it in the first place.\n\nYour employer\u2019s pension scheme had two trustees who were connected to the business, but the professional administrators were National Provident Institution and they would have held the records. But NPI itself is no longer with us. It is now part of Phoenix Life.\n\nThe trustees ordered the winding-up of the main pension scheme, but they appear to have completely overlooked your AVC, for which they were responsible.\n\nLegally, a pension scheme cannot be terminated while it still has assets, and those assets included your AVC fund. In effect then, although NPI records show that the scheme finally closed down in 2006, really it was not closed down at all.\n\nI have been negotiating through this pensions quagmire with Aviva and Phoenix since last March. There was a breakthrough when Phoenix ruled that reinstating the original trust deed was not necessary. As the closure was defective, all that was needed was for the trustees to consent to Aviva paying out your AVC money.\n\nPhoenix refused to name the trustees, though in fact I discovered them and traced them to addresses in Kent. Phoenix then told me that it saw all this as Aviva\u2019s problem, and it was up to Aviva to persuade the trustees to behave responsibly.\n\nI disagree, but Aviva did take on the task. One problem was that Phoenix had already told HM Revenue that the pension scheme was closed.\n\nAnd Aviva added: \u2018Our objective was to obtain the scheme rules which would have set out how payment from the AVC should be made, but these were not forthcoming from Phoenix.\u2019\n\nNonetheless, Aviva has succeeded. It contacted the trustees and got their consent to release your AVC money.\n\nA spokesperson told me that its only aim was to get your money to you. Aviva was conscious of the length of time this took, and was grateful for your patience. And the end result? Your AVC top-up fund has grown to more than \u00a340,000, and this is now released by Aviva and under your control.\n\nWe're watching you! The Financial Conduct Authority has finally lost patience with unauthorised investment company Park First Limited and its boss Toby Whittaker. The regulator has started court proceedings seeking compensation for 4,500 investors who ploughed \u00a3230million into the scheme, buying car park spaces with a promised yield of 10-12 per cent. The FCA alleges that the scheme was illegal from the start as it was a Collective Investment Scheme similar to a unit trust. Such schemes require FCA authorisation. The watchdog also claims the scheme was marketed with \u2018false or misleading statements\u2019. In 2017, about three years after the unlawful scheme began, the FCA decided not to prosecute Park First and its promoters. Instead, it negotiated a deal under which investors were offered their money back or a move into a different deal which the FCA helped put together. I revealed earlier this year that the FCA had struck a secret agreement with Park First, sounding tough in public but privately allowing the company to delay paying out on refund claims. In July, Park First ran out of road as refund claims mounted. The group collapsed into administration, under the control of insolvency experts Smith & Williamson. As part of a planned Company Voluntary Arrangement, the group\u2019s existing bosses would stay on, and they and the companies in the group would put \u00a333million towards partially repaying investors. But now creditors and investors are pressing for the group to be put into liquidation, and the bosses threaten to withdraw the \u00a333million offer. At present, the cash is held in bank accounts over which the FCA has a veto. The threat to snatch back the \u00a333million appears to have been the last straw for the regulator, though at present it is only seeking civil court compensation orders. The possibility of criminal prosecutions remains on the table.\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of financial wrongdoing, write to Tony Hetherington at Financial Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TS or email tony.hetherington@mailonsunday.co.uk.\n\nBecause of the high volume of enquiries, personal replies cannot be given.
