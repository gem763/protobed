While Beijing grants some few a small amount of economic autonomy, it refuses to let the average Chinese citizen fully pursue her dreams, apply her talents, or realize her potential, preventing untold advances across every field of endeavor. There\u2019s a reason Chinese parents send their children to American universities and their cash to Western banks. China\u2019s seemingly inexorable rise requires continued access to America and the fruits of our system of free enterprise and the rule of law.\n\nThis reality is coming into focus under President Trump. The administration has started to disentangle Communist China from America\u2019s economy and institutions. China\u2019s stock markets are suffering and its economy is growing at the slowest rate in nearly three decades. Additional unraveling of U.S.\u2013China ties will likely further demonstrate the bankruptcy of the Communist economic model, and its need for external support.\n\nBeijing knows this, hence its relentless focus on tamping down trade tensions, but not national security or human-rights issues. It also benefits from the widespread belief that Communist China is here to stay, so we might as well deal with it rather than hope for a better, more democratic regime. In our organization\u2019s discussions with government leaders, prominent academics, and corporations, we have found an overwhelming belief that a change in China\u2019s government would be catastrophic. They prefer to work with the devil they know, not hope for a devil they don\u2019t.", "description": "", "authors": ["Marion Smith", "Nationalreview.Com China-Communist-Government-Weaker-Than-It-Appears"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
