Analysts had expected a charge between $8.5 billion and $10 billion.\n\nGE took a $1 billion charge for its long-term care insurance business to account for the effect of falling interest rates on its obligations. The charge was about what analysts expected.\n\nGE also wrote off $740 million in goodwill for its hydro power business. Together, the insurance and goodwill charges amounted to 17 cents of EPS, GE said.\n\nThe company's loss from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $1.33 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $22.96 billion a year earlier.\n\nLoss per share from continuing operations was 15 cents, versus a loss of $2.64 a year ago, the company said.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes such charges, GE earned 15 cents per share, compared with 11 cents that analysts had on average expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nTotal revenue fell slightly to $23.36 billion from $23.39 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru and Alwyn Scott in New York; Editing by David Holmes and Nick Zieminski)", "description": "The results signaled \"progress in the transformation of GE,\" Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said.
