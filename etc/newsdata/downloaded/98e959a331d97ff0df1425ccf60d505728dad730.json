Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Getty Images\n\nThat poisonous culture, laid bare in that defeat in Nantes, accounted for Gareth Jenkins as coach and paved the way for Gatland to begin building from the ruins of humiliation.\n\nGradually, success has come, forged around Edwards feverish pursuit of defensive structure and excellence, as well as a conditioning team, led by Mathema that has seen Wales players reach performance levels which would not even have been dreamed of under previous regimes, let alone sustained.\n\nIn the space of 12 years, under Gatland, Welsh rugby has grown up.\n\nWith Fiji still reeling from back-to-back opening defeats to Australia and Uruguay, losses only slightly softened by a vastly improved display when they beat Georgia last week, Wednesday\u2019s Pool D encounter still counts for more than just pride. Victory would see McKee\u2019s men guarantee qualification for the next World Cup in four years time.\n\nBut for all the intent, passion and power Fiji will bring to the game, unbeaten Wales are surely too savvy to fall into the same trap Jenkins team fell into 12 years ago when they attempted to play the south sea islanders at their own, expansive game.\n\nThis Welsh outfit, under Gatland, have too much nous for that and the Six Nations champions will, first and foremost, look to squeeze the life out of their opponents before going looking for the jugular. Gatland said last season his team had \u201cforgotten how to lose\u201d but more importantly they\u2019ve worked out how to win.\n\nThe last three World Cup encounters between these teams have averaged 58 points a match but expect Wales to take an altogether more conservative approach to this game to avoid a repeat of the high-octane chaos they found themselves engulfed by 12 years ago.\n\nTheir totemic captain Alun Wyn Jones, whose light shows no sign of dimming despite the passing years, will lead the way in a Welsh pack showing two changes to the one which accounted for Australia.\n\nOpenside Justin Tipuric, one of the players of the tournament so far, is rested with Scarlets effervescent No7 Davies replacing him while Josh Navidi shifts to blindside flanker and No8 Ross Moriarty replaces Aaron Wainwright. For a nation blessed with extraordinary depth in the back row, the changes should not weaken the Welsh pack one jot.\n\nWith Wales fly half Dan Biggar apparently recovered from the head injury he sustained against the Wallabies, Rhys Patchell has to settle for a place on the bench despite a near faultless second half contribution against Australia.\n\nBut it speaks volumes for the quality Wales possess to have players of Patchell\u2019s quality on the bench alongside the likes of Wainwright, Tomos Williams and Aaron Shingler.\n\nIt is inconceivable Wales won\u2019t record their third successive victory, and with it progress to the quarter finals but with Japan and Uruguay both recording shocks no-one saw coming before this tournament, nothing can be taken for granted.\n\nBut this is a mature Welsh team founded on Gatland\u2019s core principles of discipline and collective responsibility.\n\nIn the space of 12 years, Welsh rugby has grown up. There can be no repeat of Nantes, can there?", "description": "It is 12 long years since Graham Dewes bundled over from close range to bring Wales\u2019 already faltering World Cup hopes crashing down as Fiji recorded the nation\u2019s greatest triumph in the 15-a-side code.
