She has risen in the polls on her own, not pushing off against somebody else,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, a top strategist for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cI hear from a lot of campaigns that she is going to have to answer questions now. Well, I don\u2019t know. She gets asked questions all the time. I\u2019m not sure that confronting her is going to have the impact that other campaigns want.\u201d\u2026\n\nAnother major Democratic donor, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said he and other donors seeking a moderate as a nominee have \u201czero interest in coming around to Elizabeth Warren.\u201d If she\u2019s the nominee, \u201cwe can\u2019t vote for her or Donald Trump\u201d and would sit out the election, he said.\n\nThe donor also expressed worries that if Warren is the nominee, her presence would ruin any Democratic chances to win the Senate, because voters would perceive having a Republican majority as \u201cthe only way to keep her in check\u201d as president.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Uncertainty-Takes-Over-The-Lead-In-The-Democratic-Presidential-Race"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
