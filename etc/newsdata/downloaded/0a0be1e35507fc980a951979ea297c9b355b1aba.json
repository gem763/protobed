Ukraine also agreed to call back its forces from the current contact line with separatist fighters.\n\nBut for many Ukrainians, these measures represent a huge betrayal by Zelenskiy who took power in April after a landslide election win. The war in eastern Ukraine has killed more than 13,000 people since April 2014.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of the full capitulation of Ukraine,\u201d 53-year-old Roman, who fought in Donbass as a volunteer. He declined to give his surname.\n\nLawmaker Yana Zinkevych, who belongs to the previous president Petro Poroshenko\u2019s party, \u201cEuropean Solidarity\u201d, was among those who addressed the rally.\n\n\u201cThis is Putin\u2019s formula, these are the things that protect Russia\u2019s interests and not ours, we have to fight and prevent its implementation,\u201d Zinkevych told the crowd from a stage in the square.\n\nLast week\u2019s deal opened the way for a resumption of top-level peace talks to end the conflict, which helped send Russia\u2019s ties with the West to post-Cold War lows in 2014.\n\nZelenskiy said last week that he would discuss a peace deal for Donbass in upcoming four-way talks with Russia, Germany and France. He said any elections in Donbass would be held only after all Russian troops had left. Russia denies having troops there.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nAs things stand, Zelenskiy\u2019s party \u201cServant of the People\u201d, which holds a majority of 251 seats in the Ukrainian parliament, is still short of the 300 votes needed to change the Constitution and give autonomy to Donbass.\n\n\u201cWe heard that the parliament must vote for some special status of those territories. We will do our best so that the parliament does not support any special status, any conditions that Russia or Putin imposes on us,\u201d said Inna Sovsun, a lawmaker of opposition Golos (Voice) party.\n\n\u201cThe only formula that we are ready to accept is the formula\u2026 that was written in our Constitution, the formula, for which thousands of people died, this is the formula of a united sovereign Ukraine\u201d, said Sovsun.", "description": "Thousands of people gathered in Kiev's main square on Sunday to protest against President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's deal with Moscow to grant autonomy to Ukraine's pro-Russian rebel-held east as part of efforts to end a five-year conflict there.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437789509&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950II", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
