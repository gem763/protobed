The program will also allow for secure information sharing across the Defense Department, so warfighting intelligence can be seamless shared among different platforms like drones, aircraft or ships.\n\nThe Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure program, better known as JEDI, could be extended for 10 years and be worth up to $10 billion if all contract options are exercised.\n\nBut it is almost certain that Microsoft's selection will not be the final word for a program that has been politically fraught and the target of a series of court challenges and other formal protests.\n\n\u201cThere is really no downside to protesting, except perhaps the ill will it might generate by causing additional delay,\u201d said Tom Spoehr, the director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for National Defense. \u201cGiven all the effort that the companies have put into their bids, a protest would not be surprising.\u201d\n\nThe competition went through several phases before Amazon and Microsoft emerged as finalists over Oracle and IBM Corp., which were among the initial bidders.\n\nOracle took the Pentagon to court in December after it was cut from the competition, alleging that the Defense Department unfairly limited competition by tailoring the JEDI requirements to Amazon's proposed solution.\n\nOracle also claimed in its lawsuit that Deap Ubhi, a former Pentagon employee who worked for Amazon, unfairly influenced the competition. In July, however, a federal judge ruled in favor of the Pentagon and also concluded that Oracle's initial proposal did not meet the contract requirements. Oracle announced in August that it would appeal that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but has not yet formally filed the appeal.\n\nOracle separately filed a protest in August 2018 with the Government Accountability Office, which also concluded that the Pentagon\u2019s procurement process was fair.\n\nWhile Oracle has been the most vocal critic of the program, IBM Corp. also filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office in October 2018 arguing that the Pentagon should select multiple winners instead of structuring the competition as winner-takes-all.\n\n\"IBM has long raised serious concerns about the structure of the JEDI procurement,\" IBM spokesperson Adam Pratt said in July. \"We continue to believe that the Department of Defense and our men and women in uniform would be best served by a multicloud strategy.\"\n\nPresident Trump, who has been engaged in a public spat with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, accusing the billionaire of using his ownership of The Washington Post to attack him, took a personal interest in the JEDI competition ahead of the contract being awarded.\n\nIn July he asked officials to review the contracting process after both members of Congress and companies themselves complained to the president that the bidding process was not open and competitive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,\u201d Trump said on July 18. \u201cSome of the greatest companies in the world are complaining about it, having to do with Amazon and the Department of Defense, and I will be asking them to look at it very closely to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nThe public spat between Trump and Bezos extends beyond this defense procurement. Trump has attacked the billionaire on Twitter for paying too little in taxes and ripping off the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nMorning Defense Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington\u2019s national security apparatus.

For example, about a dozen members of the House GOP caucus, who are not members of the House Armed Services Committee, sent a letter in July asking the president to delay the program until the Pentagon had finished investigating the fairness of the competition.\n\nThose who serve on the committees that oversee the military, however, tend to disagree. Two Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and committee ranking member Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) \u2014 wrote a similar letter to the Pentagon in August asking Defense Secretary Mark Esper to protect the program from political pressure and keep it moving forward. Four Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee, including ranking member Mac Thornberry, also sent a letter to Trump in July asking the president to allow the program to continue without interference.\n\n\u201cWhile it is understandable that some of the companies competing for the contract are disappointed at not being selected as one of the finalists, further unnecessary delays will only damage our security and increase the cost of the contract,\u201d the GOP lawmakers wrote in the letter.\n\nIn response, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced shortly after taking over the Pentagon\u2019s top job that he was personally reviewing the program, saying that he wanted to get up to speed on the major procurement through a series of learning sessions with Defense officials. During a series of listening sessions, Esper realized how contentious the program truly was and removed himself from the decision-making process because his son worked for IBM. Instead, he delegated the authority to Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist.\n\nFor good measure, the Pentagon's inspector general also conducted its own review, which began in August. The Pentagon said it had consulted with the inspector general before issuing the award and was told it could move forward.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/96/bc/d8903eac40bdb9aa6e3bab8acf1a/191025-microsoft-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
