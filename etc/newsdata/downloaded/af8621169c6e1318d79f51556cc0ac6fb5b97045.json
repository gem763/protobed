It is unacceptable for companies to suffer data leaks in this way. Once again, Facebook has let its users down.\u201d\n\nOne way the phone numbers could be exploited is through so-called SIM-swap attacks, whereby hackers intercept passcodes sent to the numbers for two-factor authentication logins.\n\nThis would allow them to break into the personal accounts of Facebook users and view private messages or hijack the user\u2019s posts. They could also intercept one time passcodes to break into any number of personal accounts.\n\nFacebook users whose numbers were exposed will also be vulnerable to spam calls, while one security researcher warned that hackers could actually use the data to hijack someone\u2019s phone.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the damage that could be done \u2013 the more a hacker knows about you the more powerful they are,\u201d Dmitry Kurbatov, CTO of Positive Technologies, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if he has information like name, surname, phone number, birth date, id number \u2013 this would probably be enough impersonate you to your mobile carrier. Then he can ask to setup call and SMS forwarding, or to swap the SIM. Essentially from there the number is hijacked.\u201d\n\nFacebook said the phone numbers have now been taken down and claims there is no evidence that any accounts were compromised with SIM-swapping attacks.\n\n\u201cThis dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year to remove people\u2019s ability to find others using their phone numbers,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said. \u201cThe underlying issue was addressed as part of a Newsroom post on 4 April 2018 by Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer.\u201d", "description": "The phone numbers of hundreds of millions of Facebook\u00a0users have been discovered online in the latest major data breach for the social network.
