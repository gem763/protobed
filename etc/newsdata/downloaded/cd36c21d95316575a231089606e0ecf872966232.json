The oddly-named 'Rebel Whopper' is identical to a regular Whopper burger with one significant difference: the patty is entirely plant based.\n\nHowever, it turns out that choosing the vegetarian option isn't always healthier. Here's how the nutritional info compares to the beef version.\n\n\"0% beef but 100% Whopper taste.\" That's how Hungry Jack's is marketing the Rebel Whopper - a new plant-based burger made in partnership with Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the alternative meat start-up v2food.\n\nCSIRO's Lab-Grown Meat Alternative Is Ready For Prime Time There is a revolution taking place in burger joints and supermarkets across Australia. Plant products that taste and behave like meat are increasingly making their way onto the plates of consumers as concern grows over the environmental impact of food production.

Unlike some plant-based meats, the product contains no genetically modified ingredients.\n\nIf Hungry Jack's can be believed, the taste is virtually indistinguishable from the beef version. This is mainly down to the flame-grilled cooking process which imparts an identical smokey, BBQ flavour.\n\n\u201cIn trials, the flavour profile of the 0% beef Rebel Whopper has stacked up brilliantly against the beef Whopper. It is very difficult to tell the difference,\u201d Scott Baird, CMO of Hungry Jacks claimed.\n\nIn addition to the faux beef patty, the Rebel Whopper comes with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickles mayo and tomato sauce on a toasted sesame seed bun. While technically animal-free, vegans are advised that the patties are cooked on the same grill as regular beef patties.\n\nNutrition breakdown\n\nHungry Jack's isn't marketing the Rebel Whopper as healthier, but the implication is definitely there. After all, how can a plant-based burger be fattier than flame-grilled beef?\n\nHere's how the Rebel Whopper compares to the regular beef version, according to the nutritional info on Hungry Jack's website.\n\nHungry Jack's Rebel Whopper Hungry Jack's Beef Whopper Energy 2790 kj 2750 kj Protein 26.1 g 28.3 g Fat 38.0 g 39.3 g Saturated fat 10.4 g 11.7 g Carbs 52.2 g 47.9 g Sugars 8.4 g 8.0 g Sodium 1150 mg 837 mg\n\nAs you can see, the Rebel Whopper is actually slightly worse for you if you're counting calories. It has a higher amount of kilojoules, sodium, sugar and carbohydrates than the beef version. It also has less protein despite being roughly the same size. The beef whopper is higher in saturated fat though (10.4g versus 11.7g.)\n\nOn the plus side, you're not slaughtering an innocent cow to get your burger fix, which has to count for something we suppose. To its credit, Hungry Jack's isn't charging a premium either - it costs the same as a regular Whopper.\n\nThe Rebel Whopper is available now in all Australian states and territories. You can also order the burger online via Hungry Jack's MenuLog page.
