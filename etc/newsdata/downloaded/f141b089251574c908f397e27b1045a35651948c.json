It is intended to eliminate eligibility for people who get food stamps because they have qualified for other forms of government aid, even though they may have savings or other assets.\n\nBut the impact of the cuts is anticipated to go further: Children in those households could also lose access to free school lunches, since food stamp eligibility is one way students can qualify for the lunches.\n\n[Trump proposal would push 3 million Americans off food stamps]\n\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in July that the change was intended to cut families that the administration thinks do not need food stamp aid.\n\n\u201cThe American people expect their government to be fair, efficient, and to have integrity \u2014 just as they do in their own homes, businesses, and communities,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cThat is why we are changing the rules, preventing abuse of a critical safety net system, so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.\u201d\n\nNearly one in seven children came from households that were considered \u201cfood insecure\u201d in 2018. Recognizing that many households rely on schools for food, some school systems have begun feeding their students through the summertime.\n\n[To reach hungry children in the summer, these school cafeterias moved outside]\n\nThe comment period for the proposed rule closed Monday, bringing it one step closer to taking effect. Children affected by the change would lose eligibility next school year, but they may still qualify under other criteria. Some high-poverty schools offer free meals to all students, regardless of their household income.\n\nThe Democratic members of the House Committee on Education and Labor in a letter Tuesday called on Perdue to halt the rule, protesting that the department did not publicize the estimated number of students who could lose free lunch eligibility during the comment period for the regulation, when interested groups could weigh in on it.\n\n\u201cBoth the SNAP and school meals programs are critical in combating food insecurity among children, ensuring children are fed nutritiously in school, during the summer and in other care settings,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBy undermining access to these essential programs, the proposed rule would worsen child food insecurity, with detrimental effects on children\u2019s academic outcomes, health and more.\u201d\n\nBrooke Hardison, a spokeswoman for the agriculture department, said the figure was not published because the department only included information about the impact on the food stamp program \u2014 not the ripple effects on the school lunch and other programs. \u201cSince the proposal does not make changes to child nutrition program policy or regulations, information regarding children who are directly certified to receive free school meals was not prepared for, or included in, the analysis developed for this SNAP rule,\u201d Hardison said.\n\nAudra McGeorge, a spokeswoman for the Republicans on the Education and Labor Committee, said the concerns are overblown.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of students will continue to be eligible for free or reduced-price meals if this rule were to be finalized,\u201d McGeorge said.", "description": "The plan is intended to cut eligibility among families considered less needy.", "authors": ["Moriah Balingit", "Reporter Covering National Education Issues", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3zLt1kAzwpT4GK22XneXx_pacQY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F24FZUG7DQI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
