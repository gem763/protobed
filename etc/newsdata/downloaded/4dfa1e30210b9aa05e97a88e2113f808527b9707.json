Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Redskins made the announcement via Twitter, saying Gruden had been informed of the decision in a morning meeting with owner Daniel Snyder and team president Bruce Allen.\n\nRedskins assistant head coach/offensive line coach Bill Callahan took over as the interim head coach. Allen said that Callahan will decide who starts at quarterback, whether it\u2019s Case Keenum, Colt McCoy or rookie Dwayne Haskins, but Callahan said it won\u2019t be Haskins right away.\n\n\u2014Kansas City coach Andy Reid downplayed the left ankle injury sustained by quarterback Patrick Mahomes during the Chiefs\u2019 Sunday loss to the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n\u201cTweaked it just a little bit. I think he\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d Reid said of the reigning NFL Most Valuable Player. \u201cHe was pretty good at the end there. We\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d\n\nMahomes didn\u2019t miss a snap in the 19-13 setback, completing 22 of 39 passes for 321 yards and a touchdown while rushing for another 17 yards on three carries.\n\n\u2014Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green will remain sidelined for this week\u2019s game while continuing to recover from ankle surgery, coach Zac Taylor said.\n\nTaylor told reporters Green will not practice leading up to Sunday, when the Bengals (0-5) visit the Baltimore Ravens (3-2).\n\nGreen has been out since injuring ligaments in his right ankle during the first practice of the preseason.\n\n\u2014Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas is not expected to be suspended for administering the hit that knocked Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph out of the Sunday game.\n\nNFL Network\u2019s Tom Pelissero cited a source informed saying that Thomas likely won\u2019t miss any time, but that the league will review the play for a possible fine.\n\n\u2014The Tennessee Titans released kicker Cairo Santos a day after he missed four field-goal attempts in a 14-7 home loss to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nNFL Network reported Tennessee would sign former Chicago Bears kicker Cody Parkey to replace Santos, who was 4-for-9 on field-goal attempts this year and 12-for-12 on extra points.\n\nParkey was released by the Bears during the offseason after he missed a 43-yarder with seconds remaining in Chicago\u2019s 16-15 playoff loss to visiting Philadelphia. He worked out for the New York Jets and the Colts but was not signed.\n\n\u2014Giants receiver Sterling Shepard is in concussion protocol for the second time this season and will miss New York\u2019s Thursday game against the New England Patriots, according to multiple reports.\n\nShepard\u2019s latest concussion occurred during the third quarter of a 28-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. The NFL Network reported that Shepard, 26, could miss \u201cconsiderable time.\u201d\n\n\u2014Giants running back Saquon Barkley returned to practice in a limited role after missing two weeks due to a sprained ankle. New York coach Pat Shurmur is unlikely to make a decision on Barkley until game day this week.\n\n\u2014Jets quarterback Sam Darnold will undergo another round of tests to determine his status for the team\u2019s Sunday game against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n\u201cIf he gets cleared, he\u2019ll start,\u201d Jets coach Adam Gase said of the second-year quarterback, who has been at an enhanced risk of sustaining a ruptured spleen as he works his way past mononucleosis.\n\n\u2014The Jacksonville Jaguars lost starting tight end James O\u2019Shaughnessy for the rest of the season due to a torn ACL, according to NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport.\n\nAn MRI exam on Monday revealed the extent of the injury, sustained during the Jaguars\u2019 Sunday loss to the Carolina Panthers.\n\n\u2014Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey was in Houston to see a back specialist at the team\u2019s request, according to Rapoport.\n\nRamsey has missed the past two games with the back problem, last appearing in the Jaguars\u2019 Thursday night game on Sept. 19, which came after he requested a trade.\n\n\u2014Indianapolis defensive end Kemoko Turay will miss the remainder of the season after sustaining a broken ankle in the Colts\u2019 win over the Chiefs, multiple media outlets reported.\n\nTuray, 24, was injured while combining with fellow defensive end Jabaal Sheard to sack Mahomes on the Chiefs\u2019 final play from scrimmage.\n\n\u2014The Patriots released 16-year veteran tight end Ben Watson.\n\nESPN first reported New England declined to activate Watson, 38, who had been suspended for the season\u2019s first four games after a violation of the NFL\u2019s performance-enhancing drugs policy.\n\n\u2014The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be without right tackle Demar Dotson and right guard Alex Cappa for their Sunday game in London against the Panthers.\n\nDotson sustained an injured hamstring and calf in Tampa Bay\u2019s 31-24 loss to New Orleans on Sunday. Cappa managed to finish the game despite breaking his arm in the second quarter.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Washington Redskins fired head coach Jay Gruden early Monday following the team's 0-5 start.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438279038&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9704B-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
