Since the article\u2019s publication online on Thursday, the newspaper has added the context that the White House already knew where the whistleblower was employed.\n\nIdentifying information published in the paper \u201crecklessly narrows that universe of suspected whistleblowers to a very few people,\u201d said Jesselyn Radack, the director of national security and human rights at the Whistleblower and Source Protection Program. \u201cThis has a very chilling effect on anyone who is even thinking of blowing the whistle and thinking of doing so through the proper channels.\u201d\n\nWhite House tried to cover up Trump's Ukraine conversation, whistleblower alleges Read more\n\nThe individual is especially at risk given that Trump lashed out at those who informed the whistleblower, comparing them to spies, and alluded to retaliation. In audio obtained by the Los Angeles Times, Trump can be heard asking: \u201cWho\u2019s the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nRadack, who has represented national security and intelligence community employees \u2013 including Edward Snowden and John Kiriakou \u2013 who have been investigated and charged under the Espionage Act, said the New York Times had left the whistleblower particularly \u201cvulnerable\u201d because they \u201care up against the full force of the entire executive branch\u201d.\n\nThe whistleblower and former NSA agent Thomas Drake, another of Radack\u2019s clients who leaked information about the agency\u2019s data-gathering in 2006, echoed concerns that the newspaper had endangered the Trump whistleblower.\n\nThomas Drake (@Thomas_Drake1) Hello \u2066\u2066@nytimes\u2069 \u2014 Is Dean #Baquet that tone deaf, especially w/ #Trump threats against w\u2019blower & sources as traitors for exposing abuse of power & its coverup? Disclosing ANY ID info endangers WB\u2019er & makes a mockery of WB\u2019er/source protection. https://t.co/uB00JyItSK\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 executive editor, Dean Baquet, defended the publication\u2019s decision. \u201cThe president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding,\u201d Baquet said in a statement. \u201cWe wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.\u201d\n\nDanielle Brian, the executive director of the not-for-profit watchdog Project On Government Oversight, argued that the move was unnecessary because the whistleblower\u2019s credibility \u201cwas already stabilized by the Inspector General and the Department of National Intelligence\u201d, which recognized the complaint and urgent and credible. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need the New York Times to tell us what agency this person came from,\u201d Brian said.\n\nMark Zaid, an attorney representing the whistleblower, wrote on Twitter: \u201cPublishing details about whistleblower will only lead to identification of someone, whether our client or wrong person, as whistleblower. This will place individual in much more dangerous situation, not only in their professional world but also their possible personal safety.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s legal team did not provide additional comment to the Guardian.\n\nThe New York Times did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for additional comment.", "description": "National security experts and advocates for whistleblower protection condemn publication of identifying information", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/570c3da5ee0087a89a2112a809468bbf122ffeb9/0_0_5198_3119/master/5198.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9a1501a8f95001ce1c744ff8992c39c6", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
