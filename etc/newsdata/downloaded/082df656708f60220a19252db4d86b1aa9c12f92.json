On Saturday Parliament asked for a delay until January and today Parliament blew its last chance. If Parliament's delay is agreed by Brussels, then the only way the country can move on is with an election. This Parliament is broken.'\n\nBoris Johnson saw his Brexit deal given historic initial approval by MPs - but they also torpedoed his plan to rush through the legislation implementing the plan\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson leaves Parliament after winning a majority for his Brexit deal but losing the crucial program motion\n\nIt comes amid a report that Mr Corbyn last week urged a group of his MPs they 'cannot afford to turn down another election request,' an insider told The Sun.\n\nThe ball is now in the EU's court and the scheduled debate on the Brexit Withdrawal Bill will be scrapped for Wednesday afternoon, though time is still allotted for the usual Prime Minister's Questions.\n\nMr Tusk tweeted: 'Following PM Boris Johnson's decision to pause the process of ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit, I will recommend the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension. For this I will propose a written procedure.'\n\nMr Tusk's tweet suggested that he will recommend accepting the proposed delay set out by the UK in a letter submitted to the bloc at the weekend which asked for Brexit to be pushed back to the end of January.\n\nThe PM was forced to send that letter under the terms of the anti-No Deal Benn Act, passed by rebel MPs, after he failed to secure MPs' backing for his deal on Saturday. Mr Johnson refused to sign that letter and made clear in a separate letter to Mr Tusk that he opposed any extension.\n\nBut the EU has taken Saturday's request seriously and as a result Mr Johnson now faces the prospect of having a delay imposed on him against his wishes with European leaders almost certain to back Mr Tusk's recommendation to avoid a No Deal split.\n\nIf the EU does offer a three month delay it will almost certainly put the UK on course for a general election before Christmas because opposition leaders have previously told Mr Johnson that they will back a snap poll once a No Deal split on Halloween has been ruled out.\n\nThe last line of Mr Tusk's tweet suggests he believes there will not need to be an emergency EU summit to agree an extension and that European leaders will be able to agree to terms simply by writing letters.\n\nMr Tusk's decision to recommend a Brexit delay comes after Mr Johnson recorded an historic triumph as the Commons approved his divorce deal in principle by 329 votes to 299 following hours of tense debate.\n\nBut Mr Johnson then suffered a huge setback as MPs effectively blocked him from keeping his 'do or die' vow to cut ties with the EU by Halloween as the Commons torpedoed a proposed 72-hour timetable for passing crucial Brexit legislation by 322 to 308.\n\nAfter the results were declared, Mr Johnson hailed the historic breakthrough, saying he was 'joyful' that MPs had finally agreed on a Brexit blueprint after rejecting Theresa May's on three separate occasions.\n\nVictory in the 'second reading' means the package has now cleared its first hurdle towards becoming law.\n\nThe margin of victory on the first vote was far greater than many people expected and Mr Johnson was urged to press ahead with the legislation.\n\nBut the defeat that followed on the so-called 'programme motion' meant that the PM's plan to get the deal through the Commons this week, a timetable which would have kept his 'do or die' vow alive, was left in tatters.\n\nHe then insisted he needed to 'pause' the passage of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill which would enshrine his deal in law and actually make Brexit happen on the grounds he needed to see how Brussels would react to the results.\n\nMr Johnson said in the immediate aftermath of the second vote result being announced: 'I must express my disappointment that the House has again voted for delay rather than a timetable that would have guaranteed that the UK would have been in a position to leave the EU on October 31 with a deal.\n\n'And we now face further uncertainty and the EU must now make up their minds over how to answer parliament's request for a delay...\n\n'I will speak to EU member states about their intentions until they have reached a decision.\n\n'Until we have reached a decision I am afraid we will pause this legislation. Let me be clear. Our policy remains that we should not delay, that we should leave the EU on October 31 and that is what I will say to the EU and I will report back to the House.\n\n'One way or another we will leave the EU with this deal to which this House has just given its assent and I thank members across the house for that hard won agreement.'\n\nMr Tusk tweeted his response less than two hours after the PM made his remarks as he appeared to dismiss Mr Johnson's renewed calls for the EU not to grant a delay.\n\nBefore the outcome of the divisions were declared, Mr Johnson had tried to heap pressure on wavering MPs by threatening to pull the legislation if the timetable was voted down.\n\nHowever, he struck a significantly more emollient tone after the results.\n\nMr Tusk's tweet suggests he will propose offering an extension to the end of January and under the terms of the Benn Act the PM will be legally obliged to accept the delay.\n\nHowever, if the bloc offered a short extension of weeks - or even days - it would give Mr Johnson huge leverage to secure support from Tory rebels and Labour MPs who are terrified of No Deal to support his agreement.\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar responded to the votes in the Commons by tweeting: 'It's welcome that the House of Commons voted by a clear majority in favour of legislation needed to enact Withdrawal Agreement.\n\n'We will now await further developments from London and Brussels about next steps including timetable for the legislation and the need for an extension.'\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva tweeted: '@EU_Commission takes note of tonight's result and expects the U.K. government to inform us about the next steps. @eucopresident is consulting leaders on the UK's request for an extension until 31 January 2020.'\n\nMr Tusk had earlier today suggested that the EU would reject Mr Johnson's plea not to offer a Brexit delay.\n\nThe European Council president made clear the bloc would always act to avoid the UK crashing out, telling the European Parliament: 'A No Deal Brexit will never be our decision.'\n\nMinisters had been growing increasingly optimistic through the day that the numbers were in place to win the first big vote on the legislation tonight, known as the second reading.\n\nBut there was deepening gloom about the programme motion throughout the day.\n\nMr Johnson wanted to get all of the Commons stages of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill completed by close of play Thursday.\n\nBut critically for Mr Johnson, former Tory rebels including Rory Stewart and Ken Clarke indicated they intended to go against the government.\n\nRemainer MPs have been hoping that they drag their heels on Brexit the EU would agree to delay the date for months so they can continue the fight for a second referendum.\n\nThe division list showed 19 Labour MPs voted for the Bill at second reading. They were joined by 285 Conservatives - including all 28 of the hardline 'Spartans' who never backed Mrs May's deal - and 25 Independents.\n\nBut just five Labour MPs rebelled to support the programme motion, along with 18 independents as the PM fell short.\n\nAfter the numbers were declared, Father of the House Mr Clarke urged Mr Johnson to press home his advantage rather than pausing the Bill.\n\n'I can't quite see the logic of pausing progress on the Bill when the whole House is expecting the next two days to be spent on it,' he said.\n\n'It would enable us to see how quickly the House is actually proceeding, what sort of time is being looked for, it may enable then, if people start filibustering, which I hope they won't, for the Government to get a majority for a timetable motion if it came back which was a modest adjustment to the one he had, because I think three or four days more would certainly do it.'\n\nLabour MP Gareth Snell, who backed the Bill, also urged the government to keep going.\n\n'The injury inflicted this evening was a mere flesh wound, and if the Leader of the House was willing to bring forward a motion tomorrow with a more considered timetable for committee stage, it would pass this House,' he said.\n\nThe margin in the vote was significantly larger than had been expected. Speaker John Bercow (right) was in charge of proceedings tonight\n\n'Some of us voted for second reading precisely so we could get on to the next stage for more scrutiny, and didn't support the programme motion because we did not believe there was sufficient time.'\n\nAnother supportive Labour MP, Ruth Smeeth, said: 'All we're asking for is the opportunity to ensure that the deal which was only presented to us last night works for our constituents and my local economy \u2013 we need slightly more time.'\n\nJeremy Corbyn, who whipped Labour MPs to oppose the government on both votes tonight, said the House had 'refused to be bounced into debating a hugely significant piece of legislation in just two days with barely any notice and analysis of the economic impact of this Bill'.\n\n'Work with us, all of us to agree a reasonable timetable, and I suspect this House will vote to debate, scrutinise and, I hope, commend the detail of this Bill. That would be the sensible way forward, and that is the offer I make on behalf of the opposition tonight,' he said.\n\nIn a gambit designed to maximise support for the programme motion earlier, Mr Johnson said: 'I will in no way allow months more of this.\n\n'If parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen and instead gets its way and decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this.\n\nPM recorded a historic victory by 329 to 299 as MPs gave his Withdrawal Agreement Bill a second reading, but MPs then thwarted the PM's efforts to rush the laws through Commons in just 72 hours by 322 to 308 (pictured: Mr Johnson folds his arms during tonight's debate)\n\n'With great regret I must say the Bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward to a general election, in no circumstances can the government continue with this.\n\n'I will argue at that election let's get Brexit done and the leader of the opposition will make his case to spend 2020 having two referendums: one on Brexit and one Scotland. The people will decide.'\n\nMr Corbyn completely ignored the issue of an election in his response to the PM. Mr Johnson would need his cooperation to force a snap poll, and Labour has twice blocked such a move, but Mr Corbyn has committed to backing one if Brexit is delayed.\n\nIn another bewildering day as politicians desperately wrestled for control of the country's destiny:\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage warned Mr Johnson's deal will turn the UK into a 'colony' of the EU and urged a delay so that an election can be held;\n\nJean-Claude Juncker moaned that his time as EU commission president had been dominated by Brexit, branding it a 'waste of time and energy';\n\nSinn Fein gloated that the Brexit turmoil is likely to spark a referendum on unifying the island of Ireland within five years;\n\nA YouGov poll found the Tories are 15 points ahead of Labour, underlining fears among Mr Corbyn's MPs that an election will be a disaster;\n\nCommons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg upped the stakes earlier by warning that 'a vote against the programme motion is a vote against Brexit',\n\nThe tough talk looked to backfire with some MPs. Former Tory MP Ed Vaizey responded on Twitter: 'Oh dear. Any more ludicrous tweets like this and I may change my mind and vote against the programme motion.'\n\nAnother ex-Conservative MP, Nick Boles dismissed Mr Johnson's 'bluff' on axing the Bill. 'No 10 is bluffing, as usual. There is no way that after winning a famous victory on 2nd reading the PM is going to pull the bill just because MPs reject the programme motion,' he tweeted. 'He will bring forward a revised motion giving us a few more days and blame Parliament for any extension.'\n\nThe simplest way of staging an early election is to pass a motion with two-thirds support in the Commons. Mr Johnson has failed twice to reach the mark.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn has previously promised to support an early poll if there is an extension agreed with the EU to remove the immediate threat of No Deal.\n\nEven if Mr Johnson brings back the legislation, the government is desperately struggling to fend off amendments that would keep the UK in the EU's customs union or force a referendum\n\nIn a fresh threat this morning, Mr Boles has tabled a change that would prolong the transition period by two years unless Parliament gives explicit approval for it to end in 2021.\n\nThat could prove unacceptable to Eurosceptics and splinter the fragile coalition Mr Johnson has created for his deal.\n\nDuring the debate, Cabinet minister Robert Buckland tried to win over critics by suggesting there will be a concession on the issue.\n\nEarlier, Mr Johnson made a rallying cry to get the Brexit deal over the line, telling MPs: 'For three-and-a-half years this Parliament has been caught in a deadlock of its own making, and the truth is that all of us bear a measure of responsibility for that outcome.\n\n'And yet by the same token, we all bear a share of responsibility, we all have the same opportunity now.\n\nJeremy Corbyn ignored the threat of a general election as he responded to the PM in the Commons debate today\n\n'The escape route is visible, the prize is visible before us, a new beginning with our friends and partners, a new beginning for a global, self-confident, outward-looking country that can do free trade deals around the world as one whole entire United Kingdom.\n\n'The deal is here on the table, the legislation to deliver it is here before us.\n\n'A clear majority in the country is now imploring us to get Brexit done in this House of Commons, and I say to this House, let us therefore do it, and let us do it now and tonight.'\n\nMr Johnson was boosted by the endorsement of his brother Jo, a Remain campaigner who quit the Cabinet last month.\n\nHe said he hoped the Bill would secure Royal Assent 'sooner rather than later'.\n\nAnd Oliver Letwin, who sparked fury by tabling a referendum at the weekend that deprived Mr Johnson of a clean vote on his plan, said: 'Getting seriously worried that HMG will pull Bill if Programme Motion is defeated.\n\n'Surely best for all of us who regard this deal as the least of the evils to vote for the Programme Motion, whatever we really think of it.'\n\nThe Fixed-Term Parliaments Act prevents the Prime Minister from choosing when to call an election.\n\nInstead, he must have the support of two-thirds of MPs or lose a formal vote of no-confidence. Labour has refused to hold a vote of confidence, and it abstained in a vote on an early election.\n\nMr Corbyn has said he is keen for an election but many Labour MPs are opposed. So ministers are looking at other ways to force an early poll.\n\nThere have been suggestions that a minor parties could be invited to hold a vote of confidence, and Tory MPs would abstain. However, it is though the Speaker will only allow a confidence motion tabled by the official Opposition.\n\nA Bill could be introduced to set aside the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, but there would be a slew of amendments that could render it impossible to pass.\n\nAnother option would be for the Government could submit a vote for an election every day until Labour 'gives in'.\n\nBut in his response, Mr Corbyn merely moaned about the deal and did not address the PM's call for an election.\n\nThe WAB runs to 110 pages and is accompanied by 124 pages of explanatory notes\n\n'We warned on Saturday that if the House passes the Government's deal, it'd be a disaster for our country,' he said.\n\n'Now, as we look through the details of the Bill, we see just how right we were.\n\n'Page after page of what amounts to nothing less than a charter for deregulation and a race to the bottom.\n\n'A deal and a Bill that fails to protect our rights and our natural world, fails to protect jobs and the economy, fails to protect every region and every nation in the United Kingdom.\n\n'This Bill confirms Northern Ireland is really in the customs union of the EU and goods will be subjected to tariffs.'\n\nShadow chancellor and Labour MP John McDonnell tweeted: 'Johnson threatening a general election because Parliament might want a few more days to scrutinise his Withdrawal Bill. Pathetic. What has he got to hide?'\n\nLabour MPs representing Leave constituencies have indicated they will support the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at second reading.\n\nWigan MP Lisa Nandy and Ashfield MP Gloria De Piero said they would support the Bill at second reading in order to be able to amend it at committee stage.\n\nIntervening during the Labour leader's speech, Ms Nandy said: 'For many people back home in towns like Wigan this is an article of faith in the Labour Party.'\n\nMs De Piero added: 'I am also minded to vote in favour of a second reading, not because I support that deal but because I don't. And I want to improve the deal so it reflects the manifesto that I stood on to respect the result of that referendum.'\n\nNo10 strategist Dominic Cummings appeared in high spirits as he arrived for work today\n\nResponding to Ms De Piero, Mr Corbyn said: 'I hope that she will understand why I believe this Bill should not be given a second reading, but I'm also sure she will agree with me that to get this Bill to debate less than 17 hours after it was published is a totally unreasonable way of treating Parliament and I hope she will also join in the lobby this evening in opposing the programme motion on this particular Bill.'\n\nOvernight Mr Johnson appealed to MPs to back his deal 'so that we can leave without disruption and provide a framework for a new relationship based on free trade and friendly co-operation'.\n\nThe PM said: 'I hope Parliament votes to take back control for itself and the British people and the country can start to focus on the cost of living, the NHS, and conserving our environment.\n\n'The public doesn't want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I. Let's get Brexit done on October 31 and move on.'\n\nOpening a new front, Mr Boles tweeted that he had tabled an amendment 'to require the government by default to seek an extension of the transition to Dec 2022 unless MPs pass a resolution to the contrary'.\n\n'We must stop No Deal Brexit in Dec 2020,' he added.", "description": "Once the Commons rejected Boris Johnson's timetable to pass the deal, the PM said he would 'pause' the bill while the EU decides whether to offer an extension - and for how long.", "authors": ["David Churchill In Strasbourg For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/02/20063604-0-image-a-2_1571792426060.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
