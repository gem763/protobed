They were handled easily by the Dallas Cowboys and it was tough for those of us sitting at home to watch.\n\nPlenty of blame to go around in the usual directions but there was one play late in the game that had Birds fans on social media absolutely livid.\n\nIf there's one thing that doesn't fly in Philly, it's lack of effort. So when it appeared as if Nelson Agholor didn't lay out for a deep ball, fans were irate.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFormer Eagle Seth Joyner was pretty harsh on Postgame Live as well.\n\n\"I've been defending [Nelson] for a long time,\" Joyner said. \"I've been trying to be the guy that sees the positives in his skill sets. Deep down inside, there's either some pitbull, some dog in you or there ain't. There's nothing but puppy in him. When I saw him not lay out for that ball, could it have been a better ball, absolutely, but not to see the effort. One thing that doesn't cost you anything is effort. You're going to go up to the window tomorrow and pick up your paycheck and you put that effort out. You wouldn't even dive for that football in a game that mattered??\"\n\nNow, before we lay in too deep on Nelly, it's worth noting that it could be a camera angle thing as beat writer Jimmy Kempski surmises. But still, come on.\n\nStory continues\n\nMy verdict -- The other angle shows that the ball is a little further away from Agholor than it appears below. He did a bad job tracking it and by the time it got to him, it was too late to lay out for it. I don't blame effort. He's just bad at tracking deep balls. https://t.co/VRj1bYKY2B \u2014 Jimmy Kempski (@JimmyKempski) October 21, 2019\n\nFans were not happy one bit.\n\nI don't know maybe it's just the angle pic.twitter.com/idtvVG2Gvg \u2014 Jimmy Donofrio (@JimmyDonofrio) October 21, 2019\n\nCan't drop a pass if you don't try and catch it\n\n\n\n-Nelson Agholor pic.twitter.com/e2Rp0Aghkj\n\n\n\n\u2014 Mike Skulsky (@MikeSkulsky) October 21, 2019\n\nNelson Agholor had alligator arms with 30 yards of open field in front of him \u2014 shamus (@shamus_clancy) October 21, 2019\n\nI don't want to hear about Carson Wentz not being able to throw deep balls. I want to hear about why Nelson Agholor can't track deep balls. Inexcusable that he didn't catch that. \u2014 Tom Dougherty (@todougherty) October 21, 2019\n\nThat throw looked like it was there, can't Agholor lay out for that? \u2014 Steve Moore (@Smoore1117) October 21, 2019\n\nBy the way, Agholor stinks. \u2014 Glen Macnow (@RealGlenMacnow) October 21, 2019\n\nNelson Agholor needs to be cut/traded/left behind in Dallas. The guy is a bum. I thought he had turned a corner in 2017 but man I was wrong. That was a big mistake by Howie \u2014 Andrew Schwegel (@numbe25) October 21, 2019\n\n\"We missed it,\" Agholor told reporters following the loss about the play.\n\nNelly wasn't the only Bird to show a lack of effort. Nate Gerry didn't appear to really want to keep Dak Prescott out of the endzone late.\n\nPlz watch Nate Gerry (47) pic.twitter.com/kEybo8l39P \u2014 Benjamin Solak (@BenjaminSolak) October 21, 2019\n\nAnyway, it's sure to be a happy Monday in Philly!\n\nDoug Pederson didn't offer up much of an explanation on the Nelson Agholor play. \"We missed it,\" he said. \u2014 Jimmy Kempski (@JimmyKempski) October 21, 2019\n\nClick here to download the MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
