His reaction is a perfect expression of the dread some of us brought to the idea of a film about Mr Rogers, a fear enhanced by what seemed the too-neat casting of Tom Hanks in the lead, one impossibly good guy playing another. But Marielle Heller\u2019s wise, sophisticated A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood turns out to be something rare \u2013 a warm-hearted film that even cynics can love.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Three stars for The Goldfinch\n\n- \u2018Diary of a wimpy king\u2019\n\n- The year\u2019s starriest film?\n\nHeller and the screenwriters, Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, have built scepticism into the film\u2019s premise. This is not a biopic, but the story of a friendship between Rogers and a journalist. Based on Tom Junod\u2019s 1998 Esquire magazine profile, the film creates a fictional reporter in Lloyd, a workaholic and the father of an infant son. Lloyd carries so much anger at his own father, Jerry (Chris Cooper), that he punches him at his sister\u2019s wedding. As he did in life, Rogers instantly turns the table on his interviewer, asking him about his childhood. Over time and many meetings, he breaks down Lloyd\u2019s resistance to both his friendship and his message of forgiveness.\n\nThis is a rich and subtle performance by Hanks\n\nHeller imaginatively sets up this premise at the start. The film begins with Hanks recreating the television show, walking in the door as Mr Rogers did every time, putting on his signature comfy red cardigan, and singing the theme song, Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbour? But after presenting a picture board with characters from the programme, he comes to a photo of Lloyd, his face bloodied. So much for any hint of sappiness or escapism. From there the film moves smoothly into Lloyd\u2019s story, including the fight with his father, and the Esquire offices where he reluctantly agrees to talk to that kids\u2019 show guy.\n\nHanks gets Rogers\u2019 mannerisms just right: the sweet half-smile; the slow and precise manner of speaking. But he doesn\u2019t coast on mimicry or his good-guy image. This is a rich and subtle performance, in which Hanks makes Fred Rogers\u2019 sincerity completely convincing and real. When Fred turns Lloyd\u2019s questions back on him, Hanks lets us see that the reaction is partly defensive but also based on genuine curiosity and care for other people. Rogers has such clarity about others and such a gentle way of guiding them out of their problems \u2013 never a harsh judgement from him \u2013 that by the end of the film he has come to seem like the world\u2019s best therapist.\n\nThe relationship between Fred and Lloyd is emblematic of the many friendships that Rogers, who died in 2003, cultivated in his life and during the remarkable 33-year run of his show. That friendship is so much the centre of the story that the film leaves Fred for long stretches to follow Lloyd. Rhys matches Hanks in creating a deeply believable character, whose trajectory from furious cynic to forgiving son could easily have been either overacted or oversimplified. Rhys\u2019s tough-minded performance reveals the hurt that has kept Lloyd so angry. Cooper is dynamic as Jerry, something of a boor, but also a man who is making a last, desperate attempt to reach his son. (That Lloyd is grappling with his estranged father and new son at once is among the screenplay\u2019s few overdone elements.) Susan Kelechi Watson brings a loving and witty edge to Lloyd\u2019s wife, Andrea, who responds to his scepticism about Mr Rogers by saying, \u201cPlease don\u2019t ruin my childhood\u201d.\n\nThe tone never becomes twee or whimsical \u2013 just as Mr Rogers did, this film takes childhood seriously\n\nJunod\u2019s article and Morgan Neville\u2019s popular 2018 documentary, Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbour, reveal how much of the film is based on reality. Like Lloyd, as a boy Junod had a stuffed bunny called Old Rabbit. A group of schoolchildren who spotted Mr Rogers in a subway car really did recognise him and lovingly sing, Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbour, an episode recreated in one of the film\u2019s most charming scenes.\n\nBut Heller\u2019s inventiveness and visual flair go beyond biography to give the film a distinctive style. The establishing shots of cities, both New York where Rogers sometimes stayed, and Pittsburgh where his show was shot, are made of miniature toys, the tiny taxis and buildings reflecting a child\u2019s view of the world. In one scene, an exhausted Lloyd hallucinates that he is part of Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighbourhood, wandering onto the set wearing the bunny ears of Old Rabbit. Yet the tone never becomes twee or whimsical \u2013 just as Mr Rogers did, this film takes childhood seriously.\n\nBeautiful Day is Heller\u2019s third film, after Diary of a Teenage Girl, with its sharp eye on adolescence, and last year\u2019s Can You Ever Forgive Me? \u2013 the story of a forger, with spectacular performances from Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant. A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood confirms her stature as a director able to reshape conventional stories with a fresh vision. With clear-eyed rigour, Heller, Hanks and Rhys put aside cheap sentiment and earn this film\u2019s authentic heartfelt emotion.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nLove film?
