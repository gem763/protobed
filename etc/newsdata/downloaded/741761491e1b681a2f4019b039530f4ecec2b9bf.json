I spent like \u00a38, and he is eating the food. Why can't he have a seat, is he not human?'.\n\nThe security guard and employee try to reason with him, as the homeless man sits at the table with his lunch.\n\n'Now he is obviously eating the food, you can't just ask him to leave. Let him eat the food and he can leave, whats the problem?', Mr Kahlon says in the clip.\n\n'He's eating his lunch, then let him eat the food,' he adds.\n\nThe security guard and employee try to reason with him, as the homeless man sits at the table with his lunch\n\nMr Kahlon said he had bought that meal for the hungry man because he looked 'hungry and weak', according to Your Southend.\n\nHe said: 'It was painful to see that someone had to search for food like that. I asked him if he was hungry and if he would like me to buy him some food? He replied yes in a very weak voice.\n\n'But as he was sitting there eating his paid-for lunch, one of the staff members went over to him with a security officer and told him to leave.\n\nMr Kahlon that he had bought that meal for the hungry man because he looked 'hungry and weak'\n\n'I understand the point of view of Starbucks, but I still feel this type of situation needed to be dealt with more respect and empathy. We are all human and we all get hungry.'\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson said: 'The interaction on video is not indicative of the environment we strive to create.\n\n'We are looking into the circumstances surrounding this customer\u2019s experience and will take appropriate action to ensure that our stores remain welcoming places for everyone.\n\n'We want every customer to have a positive experience, and we apologise that we did not meet that expectation in this instance.'", "description": "Sajid Kahlon had purchased the \u00a38.45 meal at a branch in Southend-on-Sea after spotting the man looking 'hungry' and 'searching for food'.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/19/19503680-0-image-a-16_1570645475718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
