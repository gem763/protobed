It's basically a regular smart speaker, like the Echo, with beefed-up sound so when you ask Alexa to turn up the bass, she definitely complies.''\n\nYou can get your very own for $329. It's available from 13 November 2019.\n\nImage: Amazon\n\nAmazon announced its third-generation Echo was on the way with 360-degree audio, which won't be as impressive as the above bass-heavy Studio but is better than your old Echo. It comes in four schmick fabrics and has a microphone switch so you can turn Alexa off when you don't want her to eavesdrop.\n\nFor $149, it's all yours. Nab it from 16 October 2019.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot with Clock\n\nImage: Amazon\n\nThe cutest of the products goes to the Echo Dot with Clock. This adorable device is a squished-down Echo with a slight downgrade speakers-wise. Everything else seems to be the same but you'll get a clock display with this, which is very handy.\n\nThis little cutie will set you back $99. Get yours from 16 October 2019.\n\nAmazon Echo Wall Clock\n\nImage: Amazon\n\nThis product is exactly what it says it is: a wall clock. Basically, the biggest difference between it and a regular analog clock is that it can do voice-activated countdowns but it needs to be paired with an Echo device for that to function. Other than that, it also doesn't come with a speaker so it's definitely just a clock.\n\nThis clock will be priced at $49. Add it to your collection from 22 October 2019.", "description": "Amazon announced it was releasing a bunch of products today, like smart ovens and AirPod competitors, because why the hell not?
