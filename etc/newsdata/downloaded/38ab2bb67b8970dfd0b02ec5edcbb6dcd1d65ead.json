(Picture: Channel 4)\n\nStanley Johnson and Georgia Toffolo had multiple lucky escapes on Sunday night\u2019s episode of Celebrity Hunted, after their careless behaviour \u2013 and a craving for crab sandwiches \u2013 saw them nearly get caught a number of times.\n\nFor a show best known for its contestants hitchhiking and slumming it out in the woods, 24-year-old Toff and her 79-year-old companion headed down to Torquay for a life of luxury aboard a boat in the town\u2019s marina.\n\n\u2018This is the life to which one can easily become accustomed,\u2019 said Stanley, which is a pretty strong statement from the father of the British Prime Minister, but not exactly the kind of thing you expect to hear from a fugitive on the run.\n\nWhile Toff\u2019s reasoning that finding their boat would be like finding \u2018a needle in a haystack\u2019 was pretty sound, the 24-year-old\u2019s sensible enough suggestion of looking for supplies went off the rails after the former Made in Chelsea star developed a craving for crab sandwiches (because of course she did\u2026)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalking up towards the mainland in search of the boujie food, Toff was informed that their captors had been there only minutes before.\n\nBut while Toff panicked at the news, Stanley, who had settled down with wine and bit of light reading, was more bothered by the lack of seafood than being caught, saying: \u2018Damn, well we\u2019re going to have to have dry crisps then.\u2019\n\nNot the usual Hunted location (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nYes, that is a wine glass (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nHonestly, you can\u2019t make it up.\n\nAnd fans of the show were seriously unimpressed with the pair\u2019s lax attitude to the competition, with one writing: \u2018Does Stanley Johnson actually know he\u2019s on the run? Or does he think he\u2019s on a holiday show on channel 5?\u2019\n\nDoes Stanley Johnson actually know he's on the run?

Don\u2019t use phones and don\u2019t get caught on cameras, especially withdrawing money!! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f #CelebrityHunted @Hunted_HQ pic.twitter.com/Z7QuhYNfC8 \u2014 Steven Kelly (@StevenKelly82) October 20, 2019\n\nIf Stanley and \"Toff\" aren't the first to be caught I'm going to write a letter to the hunters telling them how much they let themselves down #Celebrityhunted pic.twitter.com/dmFC3N2BIW \u2014 Julia (@JuliaCHowie) October 20, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, some definitely saw the funny side to the 79-year-old\u2019s total lack of awareness of the show\u2019s rules with his constant phone and cash point use.\n\n\u2018Stan casually withdrawing cash at every location and literally leaving a trace everywhere they go is killing me,\u2019 one viewer wrote.\n\n\u2018Every single day they\u2019ve made a massive trace electronically, yet they are always managing to be that one step ahead,\u2019 said the team boss Ben Owen.\n\n\u2018If I didn\u2019t catch Stanley Johnson, I would probably retire from this job.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
