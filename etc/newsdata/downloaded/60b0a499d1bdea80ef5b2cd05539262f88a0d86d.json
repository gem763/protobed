His voting power will also drop to three votes per share, down from 10 votes.\n\nVice Chairman Sebastian Gunningham and Chief Financial Officer Artie Minson will now serve as co-CEOs, a decision made after \"a lengthy\" board call, The New York Times reported.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the push to remove Neumann came from leaders tied to SoftBank, WeWork's largest backer, which has invested over $9 billion into the company and has representation on the board. Other board members include former officials at Coach, Goldman Sachs, and Uber, along with top private-equity and venture-capital executives.\n\nThe office-rental firm previously delayed the timeline for its initial-public-offering plan amid a wave of criticism in recent weeks, including complaints over a deal in which the company paid Neumann $5.9 million for use of the word \"We.\" That arrangement was reversed earlier this month.\n\nWeWork also made headlines when the firm revealed there were no women on its seven-member board of directors. The company quickly amended its federal filing to include one female: Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei. In the filing, WeWork said it planned to add additional directors after the IPO to create a more diverse group.\n\nNeumann's removal comes after a Wall Street Journal reported on his drug and alcohol use, including accounts of smoking marijuana on a private flight to Israel.\n\nWeWork previously adjusted its IPO filing to address investor concerns over how WeWork would be controlled after the public offering. Among them was a shift to give the board the power to remove Neumann. His wife \u2014 Rebekah Paltrow Neumann \u2014 will also no longer be involved in determining the next CEO.\n\nBelow are the board members' connections to WeWork, plus some \u2014 but not all of \u2014 their professional highlights.", "description": "Former Goldman Sachs, Coach, and Uber officials sit on the board, which reportedly came to the decision after a \"lengthy\" call on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Joe Williams"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ff91e2e22af0b417b1f54-1136-568.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
