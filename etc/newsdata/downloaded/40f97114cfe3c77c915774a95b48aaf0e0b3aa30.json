The ESPN2-televised fight is one of a couple lightning-rod fights on the show \u2013 but not because of Sosoli.\n\nHardy, more than a 3-1 favorite in the heavyweight fight, likely will forever be a source of controversy when he fights. The former NFL standout has a past that checkered with legal issues and domestic violence accusations. But in the UFC, he\u2019s been given a second chance in his athletic life.\n\nBut Sosoli isn\u2019t thinking much about that part of Hardy\u2019s story. He said from an athletic standpoint, he has no choice but to give credit where it\u2019s due.\n\n\u201cComing from one top area of your sport and transitioning over successfully so far \u2013 it\u2019s hard to make it in one big sport,\u201d Sosoli said at a Wednesday media day in support of the card. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled my whole life just to be in the UFC, and he\u2019s already played in the NFL and fought in the UFC. You\u2019ve got to give him props \u2013 he\u2019s very athletic.\u201d\n\nBut just because Hardy is athletic doesn\u2019t mean Sosoli doesn\u2019t see areas in which he can find success when the cage door closes. And while Sosoli only has three more pro MMA fights than Hardy, he\u2019s hoping his experience as a boxer, as well as big opportunities on \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter\u201d and Dana White\u2019s Contender Series will help him along.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t fought for that long, so he\u2019s still got a lot to build up,\u201d Sosoli said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re that talented and athletic, you can make up for holes until you come across people that are more well-rounded. I\u2019ve obviously got a lot more fighting experience, but he\u2019s just got that freak athleticism.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to me that (UFC president) Dana White is still giving me chances. But at the end of the day, he knows from seeing me on \u2018The Ultimate Fighter\u2019 and (Dana White\u2019s Contender Series) \u2026 at the end of the day, I just want to get in a fight. I just love fighting. I don\u2019t care what happens in the cage or in the ring. I just want to go there and get hit and hit people, and it\u2019s always good to have people like that in organizations.\u201d\n\nCoached by 10-time UFC fighter and four-time judo Olympian Daniel Kelly, Sosoli said he has the right people around him to help make his transition to the UFC a smooth one.\n\nAnd even though he\u2019s coming from Australia to fight an American in the States, which might normally be cause to consider himself in hostile territory, the tepid response many fans have toward Hardy because of his past might have Sosoli feeling a little more at home than he might otherwise expect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky because I\u2019ve got a crew that have had a lot of fights in the UFC,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone kind of let me know what to expect and what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s all been going as I\u2019ve been told, and I\u2019ve just been enjoying it.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Sosoli ahead of his UFC debut against Hardy, check out the video above.", "description": "Ben Sosoli is the second biggest underdog on Friday's card for his UFC debut, but he's got a rational way of thinking about his opponent.", "authors": ["Matt Erickson", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ben-sosoli-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
