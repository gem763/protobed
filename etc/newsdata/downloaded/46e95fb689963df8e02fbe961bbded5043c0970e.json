Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has officially arrived as a 2020 frontrunner, and at Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate, her opponents attacked her like one.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Warren has climbed her way to the top of the 2020 pack where she\u2019s now considered a frontrunner along with Vice President Joe Biden, according to a Real Clear Politics average. Up until now, Warren has largely stayed out of the fray in the Democratic debates \u2014 rarely going on the offensive and mostly escaping fire herself. That changed significantly in Ohio on Tuesday.\n\nModerate candidates Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg were ready to pounce on Warren at the start of the debate, when the oft-repeated question of whether Warren would raise taxes to pay for the Medicare-for-all plan she\u2019s backed was raised yet again. Warren told moderators that \u201ccosts will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families costs will go down,\u201d but did not directly answer yes or no about whether she\u2019d raise taxes.\n\nButtigieg, in particular, had been signaling for days he planned to hit Warren on Medicare-for-all, a plan he\u2019s repeatedly called pie-in-the-sky. He quickly took his chance.\n\n\u201cThis is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d\n\nAfter Buttigieg was done and Warren had panned the mayor\u2019s \u201cMedicare-for-all who want it\u201d plan as \u201cMedicare-for-all who can afford it,\u201d Klobuchar stepped up to the plate for her go at Warren.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie [Sanders] is being honest here and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Buttigieg and Klobuchar \u2014 both of whom are running on their Midwestern backgrounds and more moderate politics \u2014 are just going after Warren for being progressive. They\u2019re going after her because she\u2019s formidable.\n\nWarren seemed to have more incoming attacks than even Biden\n\nWarren and Biden are arguably the two frontrunners of the 2020 Democratic field, but it felt like Warren was getting the full brunt of her opponents criticism throughout much of the night. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is polling third behind the two, also largely escaped attacks \u2014 moderate candidates even commended him for saying his Medicare-for-all plan would raise taxes (disproportionately on the wealthy, Sanders pointed out).\n\nAt the beginning of the night, CNN moderator Anderson Cooper practically handed Sanders an opening to go after Biden, asking the senator from Vermont to chime in on whether Biden showed poor judgement by letting his son Hunter Biden serve on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Sanders didn\u2019t take the bait, pivoting to talking about impeaching President Donald Trump and the various other crises America faces.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) even took it upon himself to blast CNN for asking Biden about his son\u2019s business ties to Ukraine \u2014 noteworthy for someone who hasn\u2019t been shy about criticizing the former vice president in the past.\n\n\u201cThat was so offensive,\u201d Booker told the moderators and audience. \u201cWe are literally using Donald Trump\u2019s lies and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman.\u201d\n\nThe Buttigieg/Klobuchar team was much more interested in attacking Warren than Sanders; they did it again when the subject of Warren\u2019s signature wealth tax came up. Klobuchar said she wanted to deliver Warren a \u201creality check\u201d on her wealth tax, adding, \u201cyour idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nButtigieg attempted to paint Warren as a creature of Washington who is out of touch with Midwestern voters.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you how this looks from the industrial Midwest, where I live. Washington politicians, congressmen, and senators saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes,\u201d Buttigieg said on the subject of Warren\u2019s wealth tax. Warren, it should be noted, is originally from Oklahoma and is not exactly a friend to Washington; she\u2019s proposed a wide-ranging anti-corruption plan to get money out of all three branches of government.\n\nTo be sure, Warren wasn\u2019t the only person onstage to be put on the spot. But she was the target of a number of candidates\u2019 attacks; at one point, for instance, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) asked Warren to support her controversial stance on Syria, (Gabbard has expressed pro-Assad stances numerous times). Warren demurred on that question as well, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\u201d\n\nAnd Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also sparred with Warren, as she challenged her to join Harris\u2019s call for Twitter to suspend President Trump\u2019s Twitter account. Warren declined and instead talked about breaking up big tech. She challenged fellow candidates to disclose if they are taking campaign money from tech executives.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising. Warren is tough competition, and candidates who have been struggling in the polls are finally starting to act like it.\n\n.@ewarren status as frontrunner has been certified by the amount of incoming she is getting tonight. \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) October 16, 2019\n\nThese jabs shouldn\u2019t be surprising; Warren is polling well\n\nAs the progressive frontrunner, Warren is the most obvious target for moderates who are hesitant to go after Biden. And if she keeps rising in the polls, the attacks are likely to increase.\n\nWarren recently narrowly pulled ahead of Biden in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, but Biden has since reclaimed the lead. However, Warren is leading in the critical early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, while Biden has a substantial lead in South Carolina.\n\nRelated Elizabeth Warren is now leading the 2020 polls\n\nOf course, it\u2019s worth plugging another reminder that it is still early and things can (and probably will) change. We are still four months away from February\u2019s Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. And while Biden, Warren, and Sanders have all led polls for months, there are still 16 other candidates in the race \u2014 and any one of them could have a breakout moment.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Tara Golshan pointed out recently:\n\nThere isn\u2019t a clear narrative even among the top three. Fundraising totals from the third quarter put Sanders in the lead, while Biden\u2019s numbers are closer to entrepreneur Andrew Yang\u2019s than to Warren\u2019s or Sanders\u2019s. Campaigns are still building out their ground games in crucial early states, where their coalitions are overlapping. \u201cWe have basically have had a tied race going back several months now,\u201d Andy Smith, a pollster with the University of New Hampshire, told Vox. \u201cPeople make up their minds at the very end.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re still a long way away from Iowa, but tonight provided us a good look at who a lot of these candidates view as their main competition.", "description": "Warren took the brunt of the attacks.
