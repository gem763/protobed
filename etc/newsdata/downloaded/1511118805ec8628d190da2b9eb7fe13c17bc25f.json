Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he\u2019s eager to remain in the mix.\n\nBloomberg \u2013 who initially announced he wouldn\u2019t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he\u2019d consider it if Biden falters \u2013 writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things.\n\n\u201cRarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,\u201d said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who\u2019s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani.\n\n\u201cThe job\u2019s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,\u201d Bloomberg writes. \u201cThe country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief.\u201d\n\nBloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people \u201cwho are smarter than you.\u201d\n\nSo how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well.\n\n\u201cMostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,\u201d Bloomberg wrote, \u201cwhile also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news.\u201d\n\n\u2013 John Fritze\n\nAre you smarter than a bookie?\n\n6:50 p.m. EDT\n\nBetting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight\u2019s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said.\n\nCan you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting.ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden).\n\nIf you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you\u2019re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40.5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3.5.)\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nAOC's barb at Mayor Pete\n\n6:45 p.m. EDT\n\nA growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party\u2019s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate.\n\nButtigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren \u201cbelieve that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,\u2019 where private insurance is abolished.\u201d\n\nThe ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren\u2019s eschewing small donor strategy: \u201cWe're not going to beat Trump with pocket change.\u201d\n\nIn a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg \u201cinsults\u201d has outraised him.\n\nAnd the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that \u201cnumerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cMayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,\u201d the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday.\n\nTrump's one-word attack\n\n6:40 p.m. EDT\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism.\n\nIn a full-page ad in today\u2019s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats\u2019 \u201cbig government socialism will wreck Ohio\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nBanners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted \u201cSOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS.\u201d\n\nThe campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by \u201cending fossil fuels.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect\n\n5:50 p.m. EDT\n\nThe Westerville debate is the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president.", "description": "Twelve candidates will take the stage in the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio.
