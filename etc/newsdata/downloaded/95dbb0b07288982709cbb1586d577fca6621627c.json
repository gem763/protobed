is between 10 to 100 times greater than plant-based foods. If we want to avoid catastrophic levels of climate change, our levels of meat consumption cannot go on.\n\nNow, more than 60 scientists and counting have signed an open letter to mayors all over the world asking them to reduce the amount of meat available in public places such as schools and hospitals.\n\nProfessor Pete Smith from the University of Aberdeen, lead author of a recent report by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), organised the letter. He said: \u201cThe IPCC report shows that between 21 per cent and 37 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the food system, with direct emissions from livestock contributing 14.5 per cent of all human greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cReducing demand for livestock products, by eating less meat and dairy and reducing food loss and waste, will be critical for addressing the climate change emergency.\u201d\n\nLast month, top British barrister Michael Mansfield QC said eating meat could be made illegal due to the ecological damage it does.\n\n\u201cI think when we look at the damage eating meat is doing to the planet, it is not preposterous to think that one day it will become illegal,\u201d he said at the Labour Party conference.\n\nDeveloped countries consume double the global average of red and processed meat and experts believe raising prices would encourage people to eat healthier and less harmful foods.\n\nIn Germany, the Social Democrat party and the Greens are arguing that meat should be taxed at 19 per cent, with additional revenues spent on animal welfare.\n\nThe agricultural spokesperson from Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party welcomed the suggestion, describing it as a \u201cconstructive proposal\u201d.\n\nGradually, the culture around meat-eating is changing and even food giants such as Greggs say their customers are demanding vegan alternatives to their pastries.\n\nIf meat-reduction policies are implemented, more and more of us will have to jump on the vegan wagon \u2013 whether we want to or not. That can only be a good thing.", "description": "\u201cHow about restaurants in 10\u00a0to 15 years start treating carnivores the same way that smokers are treated?\u201d asked former UN official Christiana Figueres in a conference at the end of last year. \u201cIf they want to eat meat, they can do it outside the restaurant,\u201d she said.
