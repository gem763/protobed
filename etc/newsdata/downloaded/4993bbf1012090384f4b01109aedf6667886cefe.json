The champ using the sledgehammer was presented as a last resort and one step too far, the referee stopping the bout to a chorus of boos inside the area.\n\nWhile a little illogical, the finish at least allows the two to continue their feud, with the Fiend recovering enough to leave Rollins laying as the show went off the air.\n\nAll of the women\u2019s championships were on the line at Hell in a Cell, with Charlotte Flair securing the Smackdown title after making Bayley tap out to the figure eight submission. Raw women\u2019s champion Becky Lynch fared batter, downing Sasha Banks in a solid opener. Weapons were flying everywhere in this one, too, Lynch nailing the challenger with a dropkick while sat on a chair. This one also ended in submission thanks to the Dis-Arm-Her.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
