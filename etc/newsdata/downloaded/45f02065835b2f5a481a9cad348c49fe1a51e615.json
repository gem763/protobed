Their leading scorer comes off the bench in the NBA. Their starting point guard is a naturalized citizen born and raised in Florida. They are the 17th best team in the world\u2014and they almost beat Team USA.\n\nTurkey nearly pulled off a stunning win in the FIBA World Cup on Tuesday so many times that it\u2019s amazing they somehow lost.\n\nThey were up by two points when they fouled Jayson Tatum on a 3-pointer with 0.1 second left in the fourth quarter, and after he made two free throws, headed to overtime. And they had even better chances to secure the upset in overtime. They had a 92-91 lead with nine seconds left and the ball when, in a case of remarkably awful timing, Turkey proceeded to miss four straight free throws that would\u2019ve iced the biggest win in the national basketball team\u2019s history.\n\nThe Americans took advantage of their one last chance to avoid embarrassment. Khris Middleton made his two free throws to give the U.S. a 93-92 lead with two seconds left, Ersan Ilyasova missed a stepback 3-pointer at the buzzer, and Team USA escaped with a win in Shanghai that felt more like a huge sigh of relief.\n\nIt\u2019s not like a loss to Turkey would have spelled doom for the Americans in the World Cup. This is still the first round of pool play, and Team USA would have almost certainly advanced to the next round anyway. They would have played the same teams, too, with Brazil and probably Greece waiting for their shot at a team of Americans that hasn\u2019t looked this vulnerable in more than a decade.\n\nThe troubling part of Tuesday\u2019s performance for Gregg Popovich\u2019s team isn\u2019t that it almost lost for the first time in the Olympics or World Cup since 2006. This was a team that doesn\u2019t have the margin of error that most American fans now take for granted. And it\u2019s showed. Team USA already had its 78-game international winning streak snapped by Australia last month in a warm-up exhibition. But even that wasn\u2019t much of a surprise. They have known for months that not having superstars like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry or James Harden would leave them susceptible.\n\nThe problem is who nearly beat them\u2014and probably should have.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t their rival Spain. It wasn\u2019t Serbia with Nikola Jokic, France with Rudy Gobert or Greece with Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nIt was a Turkish team with three NBA players, Ersan Ilyasova, Cedi Osman and Furkan Korkmaz, who are not exactly Jokic, Gobert or the league\u2019s MVP. The most dynamic player on the team might very well be an American named Scottie Wilbekin. He\u2019s played in Australia, Greece, Israel and Turkey but never the NBA.\n\nTurkey's Cedi Osman in action against Marcus Smart of the U.S. Photo: aly song/Reuters\n\nBut one aspect of Team USA\u2019s global domination since its humiliations in 2004 and 2006 that\u2019s often forgotten is that the Americans haven\u2019t really been that dominant. They were undefeated in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016\u2014and there were tense games in most of those tournaments that nearly spoiled their perfect record under former coach Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nSpain pushed Team USA in the 2008 and 2012 Olympic gold-medal games. Brazil nearly got the Americans in group play in the 2010 world championships. Australia, Serbia and France had the U.S. on its heels in the 2016 Olympics.\n\nThis was another gut-check win for the Americans and gutting loss for Turkey, and they probably won\u2019t be the last team that makes Team USA sweat this month. The Americans should have their way with Japan on Thursday. And that\u2019s when the real tournament starts. There is a second round of group play, the knockout rounds and plenty of opportunities for the rest of the world to beat Team USA by not missing four free throws in a row.\n\nWrite to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "description": "Turkey misses four free throws in the last 10 seconds, and the Americans escape with a win.
