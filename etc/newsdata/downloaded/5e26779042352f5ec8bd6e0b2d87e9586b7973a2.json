It had also not generated all the sales the club had hoped for.\n\n\u201cDaniel Levy stressed the importance of everyone focusing their energies on getting behind the team and that we all need to work together.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s not always possible to sell players. In 90 per cent of instances either a buyer could not be found for a player or the player did not wish to join the club that had expressed an interest in buying them so the club was not able to make as many changes as desired this summer.\n\n\u201cDaniel Levy reiterated just how difficult it is to get a transfer over the line, with so many moving parts.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur have re-signed goalkeeper Michel Vorm on a deal until the end of the season.
