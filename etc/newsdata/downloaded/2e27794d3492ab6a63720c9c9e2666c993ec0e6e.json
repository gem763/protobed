The figure outpaced even last year\u2019s toll of over 25,000, which was then the highest number since the record began in 1997.\n\nThe endemic violence presents a crucial challenge for Mexico\u2019s left-wing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December promising to improve security and root out corruption.\n\nThe bloodshed was also a pivotal campaign issue last year. Former president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto vowed to stem drug cartel violence, but his tenure saw a 40% increase in murder investigations, according to Reuters.\n\nMexico\u2019s murder rate has continued to climb since the end of the drug war that ravaged the country from 2006-2012.\n\nThe fragmentation of more established cartels has left remaining factions and local gangs fighting for territory and access to drug trafficking routes, resulting in brutal violence. In September, state authorities in Jalisco resorted to temporarily storing corpses in a mobile refrigerated trailer after morgues filled up with victims of the escalating bloodshed.\n\nThe central state of Guanajuato topped 2018\u2019s skyrocketing toll with 3,290 murder probes, more than three times the state\u2019s total in 2017. Bloody turf wars have unfolded in Guanajuato as gangs duel for control of the stolen fuel market.\n\nMurders of women also rose nationwide, with 861 cases in 2018, compared to 735 the year prior.\n\nRead more: Why Mexico Is Suffering Record Levels of Violence in 2018\n\nThe same day that last year\u2019s murder statistics were released, Mexico also recorded its first death of a journalist in 2019. Rafael Murua, a radio journalist in Mexico\u2019s northern Baja California Sur state, was found dead Sunday, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nMexico has become an increasingly hostile to journalists. Nine journalists were killed in Mexico in 2018, making it the third-deadliest country in the world for the media, according to press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF).\n\nWrite to Eli Meixler at eli.meixler@time.com.", "description": "The toll in 2017 was the highest since the record began.
