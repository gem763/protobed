Mixon on March 1 about 3:15 a.m., \"for merely looking at him while stopped at a red traffic light.\"\n\nMixon was traveling west on Thunderbird Road in a Dodge pickup truck at the time of the shooting, according to the police press release.\n\nThe shooting caused the truck to cross into eastbound lanes and leave the roadway, according to police. The truck hit a power pole and then traveled through a wall before coming to a stop.\n\nRoad rage: Police: 13-year-old on sidewalk seriously injured by driver going 75 mph\n\nMixon was taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died of his injuries, according to the police press release. He was the sole occupant of the truck, according to Maricopa County court documents.\n\nPolice say they originally believed the incident was a single-vehicle collision. However, an autopsy on March 2 revealed Mixon had been shot and his death was determined to be a homicide, court documents say.\n\nElliott fled the scene after the shooting, the court documents say.\n\nSurveillance video from the area of 32nd Street and Thunderbird Road, which police say was the closest major intersection to the shooting, showed Mixon stopped at a red light March 1 about 2:40 a.m. when a larger pickup truck stopped directly beside him in a left-turn lane, according to court documents. The video shows the larger truck did not turn left onto 32nd Street and instead continued west on Thunderbird Road while Mixon followed, the court documents add.\n\nThe shooting and collision that followed were out of the camera's view, court documents say.\n\nAn anonymous person reported in July that they overheard Elliott talking about shooting someone in the face earlier this year because the man gave him a dirty look while they were stopped next to each other at an intersection, according to the court documents.\n\nThree other people interviewed by police said they were present at the time of the shooting, according to court documents. They said Mixon \"merely looked over at (Elliott) which in turn enraged (him) to fire his handgun at (Mixon),\" the court documents add.\n\nOther witnesses interviewed by police said Elliott bragged about the shooting, according to court documents.\n\nDuring an interview with police Thursday, Elliott said he remembered arguing with a man while at a red light, the court documents say. He said he had forgotten whether he fired a weapon at the man but said \"if he could go back in time, he would take the incident back,\" the court documents say.\n\nPolice say Elliott also admitted that firearms and drugs found during his arrest belonged to him, according to court documents.\n\nElliott is being held on a $1 million bond and is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 3, according to court documents.\n\nFollow Chelsea Curtis on Twitter: @curtis_chels.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Nicolas Elliott arrested in shooting death of a motorist in Phoenix", "description": "Police say Nicolas Elliott shot and killed another motorist \"for merely looking at him while stopped at a red traffic light.\"", "authors": ["Chelsea Curtis", "Arizona Republic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AAgrX0RqtEEOAFqc2F7tMg--~B/aD01MDA7dz00MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/f62703a676ddc064554478f5881ae12c", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
