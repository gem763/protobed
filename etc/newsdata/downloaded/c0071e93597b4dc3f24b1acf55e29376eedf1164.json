Those types of advances have given Witty hope that automakers will be persuaded by consumers, who want more safety features.\n\nBut she is impatient for that to happen. In 2000, Witty\u2019s 16-year-old daughter was killed by another teen who\u2019d had too many tequila shots and was driving 65 miles per hour in a 30 mph zone. According to Witty, the young driver, who was drunk and high on marijuana, \u201clost control of her car and spun off the road onto the bike path\u201d where her daughter was rollerblading.\n\n\u201cAnd so my daughter, Helen Marie, looked up and saw the car coming toward her and there was nothing she could do at all but die,\u201d Witty said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Npr.Org A-Push-To-Have-Cars-Say-No-To-Drunk-Drivers"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
