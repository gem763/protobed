Victory over Fiji will secure a spot in the quarterfinals against either England or France.\n\nBut assistant coach Stephen Jones will be ramming the message home to his players not to lose focus against Fiji, and he is well placed to know the consequences any lapses. He played at flyhalf in that 38-34 defeat 12 years ago.\n\n\u201cIt highlighted what Fijian rugby is all about,\u201d Jones said. \u201cGive them space and time and they move the ball well and have an offloading game and put you under pressure,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey did that day and scored some wonderful tries.\u201d\n\nFiji\u2019s confidence often dictates how well the team plays and the players have been erratic so far in Japan. Head coach John McKee\u2019s lineup played brilliantly to lead at halftime before losing to two-time champion Australia 39-21, and was then shocked 30-27 by Uruguay in one of the tournament\u2019s big upsets.\n\nFacing criticism back home, the under-pressure Fijians trounced Georgia 45-10. Left winger Semi Radradra was mesmerizing, setting up tries with brilliant offloads and scoring two of his own.\n\n\u201cFiji have got quality players with a lot of X-factor. The biggest message for us is stopping that threat and not getting drawn into playing the Fiji way,\u201d Wales hooker Ken Owens said. \u201cOur game plan is going to be about stopping their X-factor players on the gain line. We have got massive respect for Fiji, but we have got a lot of quality as well.\u201d\n\nSix Nations champion Wales has shown glimpses of its best form in Japan, but not over an entire game.\n\nWarren Gatland\u2019s lineup beat Georgia 43-14 and held off Australia 29-25, losing intensity in the second half both times.\n\nFrom leading Georgia 29-0 it was pegged back after the break.\n\nDominating 26-8 against the Wallabies three minutes into the second half, the Welsh players were just hanging on by the end.\n\n\u201cWe would have liked to attack a little bit more in that second half against Australia,\u201d Owens said. \u201cWe are slowly building that momentum so there is a lot more to come, which is a great position to be in having had a win against Australia.\u201d\n\nFiji\u2019s realistic aim is finishing third and qualifying automatically for the 2023 World Cup.\n\n\u201cFor the Flying Fijians, it\u2019s an opportunity to show everyone what we\u2019re capable of,\u201d McKee said. \u201cThere is a lot at stake for Wales and they want to finish top of the pool in their passage to the playoffs.\u201d\n\nThe Fijians have unpredictable brilliance, but the diversity of the Wales attack is also a big threat.\n\n\u201cOne thing with Wales is that they have a number of options. They can play the direct route through the multiphase off nine and they can also play around the edges,\u201d McKee said. \u201cThey also have a good kicking game and will put you under pressure with contestable kicks. That\u2019s something we have to deal with. There\u2019s no one place where you can say the threat is going to come from.\u201d\n\nFiji\u2019s performance against Georgia\u2019s burly pack showed it has improved its scrummaging from the Uruguay game. But led by the inspirational Alun Wyn Jones at lock, Wales is a different proposition in the set piece.\n\n\u201cThe forwards will be a massive fight for us,\u201d Fiji backrower Viliame Mata said. \u201cIt was a good fight against Georgia - (now) we have to match Wales.\u201d\n\nFiji swapped Viliame Mata in at No. 8 for Peceli Yato in the only change to the starting lineup against Georgia, and lock Leone Nakarawa needs one more carry to hold the outright record for Fiji in World Cup history with 105.\n\nWales flyhalf Dan Biggar - who has 376 points from 75 test matches - has been cleared to play after picking up a head injury against Australia.\n\nGatland has made only two changes from that game. Ross Moriarty replaces Aaron Wainwright at No. 8 and James Davies makes his World Cup debut at openside flanker instead of Justin Tipuric.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nWales: Liam Williams, George North, Jonathan Davies, Hadleigh Parkes, Josh Adams, Dan Biggar, Gareth Davies; Ross Moriarty, James Davies, Josh Navidi, Alun Wyn Jones (captain), Jake Ball, Tom Francis, Ken Owens, Wyn Jones.
