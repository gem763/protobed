Just making it out of the qualifying rounds can secure cash rewards of thousands of dollars, a tempting prize for many gamers.\n\n\"Many players may cheat to earn real money from prize places or to qualify for tournaments,\" said Alexander Chegrinez, chief business development officer at StarLadder. \"This growing tendency can undermine confidence in the eSports industry and decrease the popularity of online tournaments.\"\n\nCheats are just another form of malware\n\nKaspersky said that designing the new Kaspersky Anti-Cheat platform wasn't such a big stretch from its daily work of fighting malware and hackers.\n\n\"Cheating in professional e-sports is basically another cyberthreat, and software cheats are not all that different from malware,\" said Kaspersky's Nikolay Pankov.\n\n\"Our solution is cloud-based for real-time monitoring of attempts to cheat during competition, providing judges with technical confirmation of the use of cheats,\" he added. \"Although the final verdict comes from a human judge, the system makes it easier to determine whether a player cheated.\"\n\n\"And, crucially, our system has no impact on performance or gameplay; all number-crunching is done on cloud servers, not on players' machines.\"\n\nTournament organizers can inquire about Kaspersky's new service on the Kaspersky Anti-Cheat homepage. The service is only available for PCs.\n\nA 2018 survey from Irdeto found that one in three gamers confessed to cheating and only 12% of gamers never had their multiplayer gaming experience spoiled by a player using cheats.", "description": "Because gaming cheats are not all that different from malware, Kaspersky launches e-sports anti-cheat solution.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/977ff29e-b148-4996-88b4-e6fc8395a395/thumbnail/770x578/a9e6f261d799af1dfafae979205fab03/e-sports-gaming.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
