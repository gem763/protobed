While Vinnie got the all-clear, Tanya could not break free of the disease\u2019s cruel clutches.\n\nVinnie shed tears but was also able to smile proudly as he revealed Tanya\u2019s courage and told of their precious final days at home in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd ruling out ever falling in love again, he declared: \u201cShe was the light of my life. I will never be with anyone else.\u201d\n\nVinnie, 54, also revealed he had felt Tanya\u2019s soul leave the room after she passed away. Later that night he sensed her presence in the form of a white light in the sky.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nSpeaking at Tanya\u2019s childhood home near Watford, Vinnie told the Sunday Mirror: \u201cIn that last week of her life when the doctors said there were no more treatments, I never told her she was dying. We never spoke of that, I didn\u2019t want her to know.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut she kept saying \u2018take me home. Can I go home now?\u2019 She desperately wanted to go home.\n\n\"So did she know? Probably. In the hospital I slept there every night and Kaley would come every morning.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has never ever slept one night in hospital without me there. I have always been by her side.\n\n\"On the week of her death, the doctors said very nicely: \u2018These are your options, we don\u2019t know if it is going to be months or weeks\u2019.\n\n\u201cThrough my grief I said: \u2018I don\u2019t want her to be in any pain\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo we took her home. Straight away she was on the oxygen. Then she was on fentanyl. We got some beautiful innocent moments in those last days.\n\n\"She would try and get out of the patio windows or she would wake up and look and me and go: \u2018You... you know.\u2019 Some of the moments would make you laugh.\n\n\"These were very special moments.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nTanya \u2013 who had an emergency heart transplant after Kaley was born \u2013 was first diagnosed with cancer in 2013.\n\nShe was treated at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles before living out her final days in the couple\u2019s Hollywood home.\n\nThey had moved to Tinseltown after Vinnie went from footie hero to movie favourite following his breakthrough role in Guy Ritchie\u2019s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 21 years ago.\n\nVinnie told the Mirror: \u201cShe would sleep a lot, wake up, then fall asleep again. The nurses and doctors said: \u2018Talk away, she is listening to you.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere was one moment when we were talking about her horse and she was fast asleep, then all of a sudden she put her hands up like she was riding a horse.\n\n\"She was stroking her pillow, as if stroking the horse\u2019s mane.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nChoked up, Vinnie\u2019s voice cracked before he continued: \u201cIt proved to us she was listening. \u201cThen when she started asking for morphine. We knew that was the countdown.\u201d\n\nOver her final weeks Vinnie would sleep in a room opposite to Tanya and they would blow each other kisses.\n\nDescribing the moments before she died on July 6, Vinnie went on: \u201cI woke up to hear this coughing. I had read a lot of books, you don\u2019t want to read them but you do, and I knew what that coughing meant.\n\n\"I flew up and went into her room. She was gasping for breath for about 25 minutes. We got everyone in the room, Kaley, her parents, her brother. We were all there. The nurse was giving her morphine.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was the end, we were cuddling her. I kissed her a lot and told her I loved her. I kept saying: \u2018I love you, I love you.\u201d\n\nSpeaking through his tears, Vinnie added: \u201cIt was all very peaceful, then her gasps got less and less and she went quiet. I looked at the nurse and said: \u2018Has she gone?\u2019 And that was it.\n\n\u201cIt all happened so quickly, you are not prepared for it. So we sat there for an hour with her. We were completely numb. It was as though she was still sleeping. But she was gone.\n\n\u201cWhen she finally went it felt like Tinker Bell had released from her. It felt like her spirit was moving in the room. I got peace from that.\u201d\n\nLater that night Vinnie received a sign from Tanya.\n\n\u201cWe were outside until about midnight but I was the last to go to bed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWith Tanya, she would always blow me a kiss and I would catch it and carry it with me.\n\n\u201cI went to go in and I looked up and there was a small white light up straight above me. I thought it was strange.\n\n\"It was right there above the house. So I went: \u2018Is that you babe?\u2019 But the light didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cThen as I went to go in, I turned, blew her a kiss and threw it. And the light that had been there went straight over my head, then it went across my vision, then up into the sky.\n\n\u201cThat was her saying \u2018we are all done, everything is good. I\u2019m up there, I\u2019m going to wait for you\u2019.\n\n\"I never believed in any of that spiritual stuff. Never. I thought it was a load of BS. But now I believe in an afterlife.\u201d\n\nVinnie \u2013 who won a legion of fans as a soccer hardman with Wimbledon, Chelsea and Leeds \u2013 was married to Tanya for 25 years and adopted Kaley.\n\nTheir story is one of showbusiness\u2019s most enduring romances. They renewed their vows in 2007 and Vinnie wore his original wedding suit.\n\nAnd the star, who won the FA Cup in Wimbledon\u2019s famous 1988 win over Liverpool, is adamant no one will ever replace Tanya in his heart.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m a shell. She is the only one... whenever I let myself down, or her down, she was always the strongest, the person who I answered to.\n\n\"She wouldn\u2019t give me her blessing to meet someone else \u2013 I just know her. I can\u2019t see it happening, I might have friends or whatever, I would be astonished if that happens.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve only got a little way to go until I\u2019m with her, in the spectrum of the universe.\u201d\n\nSince Tanya\u2019s death, Vinnie has moved out of their LA home. \u201cThere are so many memories there, it is too painful. I had to sell up,\u201d he explained.\n\nVinnie, wearing his trademark flat cap, spoke to the Mirror in the home where Tanya was born \u2013 literally just feet from where he sat yesterday.\n\nThey had renovated the modest semi-detached property but Tanya only saw the stylishly revamped interior once before she died.\n\n\u201cThis place is so special to us,\u201d said Vinnie. \u201cBeing here does feel good. Her brother is living here with me and there is a constant stream of people through the front door.\n\n\u201cAn outsider might say, he\u2019s doing well. But in the evenings, I\u2019ve cried almost every night.\n\n\"How am I going to go on? One of the guys at golf said, how are you doing? He said: \u2018I lost my wife 14 years ago. Let me tell you, it don\u2019t get no better\u2019.\u201d\n\nThen Vinnie smiled at the thought of his beautiful wife and added: \u201cPeople say, how did it last? And I say because it was real, true love. I think we found true love.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The actor and former footballer reveals he has cried almost every night in his first moving interview since Tanya died aged 53", "authors": ["Halina Watts", "Image", "Tim Merry"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469421.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Vinnie-JonesA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
