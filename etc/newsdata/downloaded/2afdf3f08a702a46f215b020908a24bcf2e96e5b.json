Find out how to contact him below.\n\nP.M. writes: My wife and I were looking at investing \u00a320,000 and found the Investment Chronicle website offering a return of 38 per cent in 36 months. My wife requested information and got a prompt call from a salesman who, when she said we might not commit to 36 months, gave a sales pitch offering 15 per cent interest over 12 months. The company's website mentions the Daily Mail, giving the impression the newspaper sponsors the company, but we now smell a rat.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with your sense of smell. The Investment Chronicle website has no connection to the Daily Mail, nor is it linked to the long established Investors Chronicle magazine.\n\nOur readers got a call from a salesman of My Property Stream, whose website confirms it is marketing bonds and is backed by a picture of a modern building in Preston, Lancashire\n\nThe website you found is fairly new. Its controllers are unknown and its internet fees are only paid up until December, which makes me suspect it is not planning to stay around for long. So what was it trying to sell you?\n\nWell, the call to your wife and following email came from a firm in London called My Property Stream. Its website confirms it is marketing bonds \u2013 IOUs issued by developers. It pledges: 'Property investments marketed on this website are secured by bricks and mortar, tangible assets we can touch and feel.'\n\nThis assurance is backed by a picture of a modern four-storey apartment building. I traced the building to Preston, Lancashire, but could find no connection to My Property Stream, so I asked its owner and sole director John Gow whether his company does own an interest in the building.\n\nI also asked him to back up his firm's claim that it has a team of people with 'decades of experience within the property and investment sectors'. And of course I questioned the use of the Daily Mail's name. Finally, I questioned whether My Property Stream is a genuine member of the Property Ombudsman scheme, whose logo it uses.\n\nGow failed to give an answer about the Preston apartment block or his team of experts. He blamed the misuse of the Daily Mail's name on outside agents he hired, saying 'We trialled the services of a marketing company. They are in control of the campaign and content, we simply receive the leads.'\n\nGow refused to identify the marketers unless I gave him and My Property Stream anonymity in this report. Fat chance.\n\nBut his use of the Property Ombudsman logo is half right. As well as flogging IOUs for builders, My Property Stream sells property itself as an investment and is a member of the Association of International Property Professionals. After a lot of pressing, the Ombudsman confirmed that the AIPP membership does entitle Gow's customers to lodge complaints with the Ombudsman if necessary.\n\nSo does this mean the Property Ombudsman will investigate complaints involving My Property Stream's sale of IOUs? No. Property Ombudsman Katrine Sporle told me: 'The business is selling a financial product, not a property.' Her office would not even look at complaints on this front let alone investigate them.\n\nHow about the Financial Conduct Authority? Well, the FCA would not investigate either. Despite a string a failures involving high interest, high risk bonds, they fall through a gap in the system. So despite the unidentified sales agents, unnamed property experts, unexplained picture of the Preston apartment, misuse of the Daily Mail name and logo of an Ombudsman with no power, My Property Stream can carry on regardless.\n\nOnce more, consumers are on their own.\n\nHertz won't waver on waiver\n\nI.W. writes: I paid in full online to hire a car for 116 days from Hertz in Malaga, Spain. When I arrived, Hertz told me Spanish law meant I had to return the car after 96 days and exchange it for a different one, with nothing more to pay. But when I returned the car with a full tank of petrol, they charged me again for petrol for the new car, then added a fresh charge for insurance, even though I had already paid for this too.\n\nHertz wrongly charged our reader \u00a317 for an 'early return' fee\n\nWhen you collected the first car, Hertz took your credit card details for an insurance deposit, but used this to charge you for petrol and to renew the insurance. It turns out that under Spanish law, car rental rules apply for three months only, after which it counts as leasing, for which different laws apply. So Hertz swaps cars after three months.\n\nHertz says you returned the first car with three quarters of a tank of petrol, so it is sticking to its charge for fuel and the 'service fee' it added on top for this. But it did accept that it wrongly charged you \u00a317 as an 'early return' fee, though you were picking up the new car at Hertz's insistence. This fee has now been refunded.\n\nThat leaves the biggest extra charge of all, \u00a3270 for insurance supposedly included in your first payment.\n\nHertz said: 'Mr W agreed to take the optional Super Cover Damage Waiver to waive liability for paying any excess in case of damage or theft.' You have denied this completely, explaining that you rejected SCDW and chose the option allowing you to give Hertz your credit card details instead.\n\nSure enough, your car hire voucher confirms that you left a refundable deposit of about \u00a3900 instead of paying for extra insurance. But you have told me that Hertz staff refused to let you have the car unless you signed a form they had completed in Spanish.\n\nWhen I pointed this out, Hertz first blamed its UK booking agent, denying that it had taken the \u00a3900-plus safety deposit, then insisted that, though the docket was in Spanish, 'someone' explained it all in English and you opted to pay hundreds of pounds for SCDW rather than provide a refundable deposit of \u00a3900 or so.\n\nAnyone who has ever collected a rental car at a busy airport will know that the chances of getting staff to explain and translate a contract are remote. But Hertz is sticking to its version of events.\n\nAs I warned a few weeks ago, top-up insurance charges are growing \u2013 even for people who think they have already paid for insurance. Buyer beware.\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of financial wrongdoing, write to Tony Hetherington at Financial Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TS or email tony.hetherington@mailonsunday.co.uk.\n\nBecause of the high volume of enquiries, personal replies cannot be given.
