Mr. Hunter \u2014 who died on Sept. 23 at the age of 78 \u2014 never sang on record or played an instrument with the band. But he wrote the words for their most iconic songs: \u201cTruckin\u2019,\u201d \u201cUncle John\u2019s Band,\u201d \u201cFriend of the Devil\u201d and more.\n\nMr. Hunter refused to explain what his words meant, preferring to let the songs speak for themselves. In making the 2017 documentary \u201cLong Strange Trip,\u201d Amir Bar-Lev managed to get the reclusive Mr. Hunter on film. In that interview, Mr. Hunter recited the inscrutable lyrics to \u201cDark Star,\u201d (\u201cGlass hand dissolving in ice petal flowers revolving,\u201d) and then simply stated, \u201cIt says what it means,\u201d as if this were self-evident. And who knows? Perhaps it was.\n\nIt takes a particular form of genius to sustain an artistic collaboration, a relationship that may have more in common with a marriage than a business. John Lennon and Paul McCartney brought out the best in each other \u2014 for a while, anyway. So did Gilbert and Sullivan, and Simon and Garfunkel, and the Everly Brothers. It\u2019s not always clear where Gillian Welch\u2019s songs end and David Rawlings\u2019s begin; Mr. Rawlings has described himself as \u201cbeing one half of a group called \u2018Gillian Welch.\u2019\u201d\n\nRobert Hunter would have bristled if anyone had the gall to suggest he was half of a group called \u201cJerry Garcia.\u201d But he did possess an uncanny ability to find the words that expressed the heart of his friend. They\u2019d met as teenagers in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1961, at a local production of the musical \u201cDamn Yankees,\u201d and it is lovely to think of those two young men sitting side by side, listening to the song \u201cHeart\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta have heart/ All you really need is heart/ When the odds are saying you\u2019ll never win /That\u2019s when the grin should start.\u201d\n\nIn their long years as partners, the two would do a lot of grinning. They would weep sometimes, too.", "description": "Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia were one of rock\u2019s great creative duos.", "authors": ["Jennifer Finney Boylan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/16Boylan/16Boylan-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
