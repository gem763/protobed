'It's extremely easy and cheap to make!'\n\nThe savvy mother told how she tackled the creation (pictured) herself after her husband was made redundant and they didn't have money to spare\n\nAmanda Murray, 33, from Montrose in Scotland, saved a staggering \u00a3400 by creating a LEGO table for her son Brodie, four (pictured together) herself\n\nAmanda's post quickly went viral, with nearly 500 likes and over 100 congratulatory comments from fellow money-savers keen to copy the idea.\n\n'I'm always on the hunt to save money and make my own things on a budget,' explained Amanda.\n\n'I came up with the idea after wanting to get my son some LEGO for his fourth birthday.\n\nShe continued: 'I didn't want LEGO sprawled all over the floor and every parent knows the damage that can be done with standing on a bit.\n\n'So after seeing a few people sticking LEGO bases to various tables I wanted to come up with a table that was functional but also had storage.'\n\n'My husband was made redundant in May from his job so we really didn't have a lot of money. I'm always looking for thrifty ways to save.'\n\nAmanda went on the hunt for inspiration at budget stores such as IKEA to make her DIY table.\n\nTables designed especially for lego can prove pricey: the table pictured costs a staggering \u00a3416.94 on Amazon, meaning Amanda saved over \u00a3400 by doing it herself\n\nAfter posting her creative piece of work, Amanda's post went viral and has since received almost 500 likes and over 100 congratulatory comments (pictured)\n\n'From IKEA I bought the white Lack side table for \u00a36, a Sunnersta rail at \u00a31.50, three Sunnersta containers at 50p each and a Trofast storage tray at \u00a31.50,' she said.\n\n'I also bought a LEGO base plate for \u00a33.99 from Home Bargains, and finally I took the Trofast green storage tray to my local Screwfix, who then helped me pick some PVC U-shaped rails I got for \u00a31.20, which can be cut to size. In total, I spent \u00a315.69 to build this.'\n\nOnce Amanda had all her supplies, she needed to go about building the nifty table.\n\n'The first thing I did was to attach the rails on the underside of the table for the tray to go on underneath,' Amanda said.\n\n'I cut the PVC to size and attached with screws. The green Trofast tray then just slides on like a drawer.'\n\n'I then popped the table legs on and went ahead and screwed the rail onto the side of the table. The containers simply hook onto the rail.\n\nAmanda made the creation (pictured) for her son's birthday and went on to say 'it's extremely easy and cheap to make'\n\n'Finally, I took some Gorilla Glue and glued the LEGO base to the middle of the table. I used a damp cloth to wipe off the excess round the side that spilled out and left it overnight to dry.'\n\nUnsurprisingly, Brodie absolutely loves his new LEGO table.\n\n'I was really excited creating it, knowing not only was my son Brodie going to love it but I had managed to make it for such a small amount of money,' Amanda enthused.\n\n'He plays with the table every day. He got lots of LEGO from family and friends for his birthday and so was over the moon to find he had a new table especially for it to play on.'\n\nShe continued: 'My tips for people wanting to create something similar would be not to doubt yourself that you won't manage because you really can. For something that costs so little, this will last a long time and the child can grow with it.'\n\nTom Church, co-founder of LatestDeals.co.uk, added: 'We love seeing projects like this on the Latest Deals Facebook group, and I wish I had a table like this when I was Brodie's age!\n\n'I love the practicality and functionality of the table in that it keeps everything tidy, and best of all, it's seriously affordable to make.\n\nIKEA is such a great option for those looking to flex DIY creativity, as it's so wallet-friendly and serves as the perfect blank canvas for experimenting.'", "description": "Amanda Murray, 33, from Scotland made her son Brodie's LEGO table with a side table,storage containers and tray from IKEA, a LEGO base plate from Home Bargains and a rail from Screwfix.", "authors": ["Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20183500-0-image-a-42_1572013725735.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
