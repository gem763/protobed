Despite his lame-duck status, D\u2019Antoni says not having a long-term deal won\u2019t impact the way he\u2019ll coach, according to USA Today.\n\nThe 68-year-old D\u2019Antoni has experienced plenty of success with the Rockets. Over the past three seasons, D\u2019Antoni has compiled a 173-73 record with the team. He has the Rockets out to a 2-1 start this year.\n\nThat success hasn\u2019t resulted in a long-term deal for D\u2019Antoni. The two sides reportedly negotiated extensions in the offseason, but couldn\u2019t come to an agreement. The Rockets reportedly only wanted to extend D\u2019Antoni\u2019s contract by a year. He balked at that offer.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhile there are issues with D\u2019Antoni heading into the season as a lame duck, he doesn\u2019t see it that way, according to USA Today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change the way I coach or how I feel trying to compete,\" D\u2019Antoni told USA TODAY Sports. \"So then we\u2019ll see next summer with what happens.\"\n\nD\u2019Antoni added that he doesn\u2019t think the players care that D\u2019Antoni doesn\u2019t have a contract beyond this season.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing. The fear with most lame-duck coaches is that the team will tune them out if it struggles. As long as the Rockets continue to win under D\u2019Antoni, that won\u2019t be an issue.\n\nBut if the team starts to struggle, or goes on a losing streak, D\u2019Antoni\u2019s status with the franchise will be questioned. Even if the Rockets get to the playoffs, winning it all might be necessary for D\u2019Antoni to get the deal he wants in Houston.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
