Once inside the iPhone, this implant was able to steal messages, photos, and GPS location data in real-time.\n\nAlthough the blog post didn't say exactly how many of these websites they were, the researchers estimated each one received thousands of visitors a week. The hacks spanned iOS 10 through 12, which Beer said indicated a \"sustained effort\" to hack iPhones over a period of two years.\n\nThe websites gained access to the iPhones through five different methods or \"exploit chains.\" The researchers found 14 separate vulnerabilities which made these exploit chains possible. Seven of these vulnerabilities were found in Safari, iPhones' default web browser.\n\nThe researchers told Apple about their findings in February, and gave the company a seven-day deadline to fix the vulnerabilities. Six days later, Apple updated the security on iOS 12. Google gave Apple a much tighter deadline than is usual in security disclosure, which the norm being 90 days to patch issues.\n\nGenerally Apple has a strong reputation when it comes to security, and earlier this month the company upped the amount of money it's willing to shell out for bug bounties - vulnerabilities found by security researchers - to $1 million.\n\nApple declined to comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Hackers were able to steal messages, photos, and real-time GPS location data through a 'monitoring implant.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8537/eae2243a8a964d44b8e8e284917bcb99.png", "published_at": "2019-08-31"}
