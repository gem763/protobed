Turkey fumes over \u2018meddling\u2019 after US embassy LIKES tweet by exiled \u2018terrorist-linked\u2019 journalist", "language": "en", "text": "US Embassy in Turkey liked a Twitter post of an exiled journalist concerning a Turkish party leader\u2019s health, and unleashed furious reaction online. While the mission said it was an \u201cerror,\u201d Turkish politicians were not convinced.\n\nRead more\n\nOne should be mindful of what they\u2019re doing on social media these days \u2013 especially when running official accounts, as a single \u201clike\u201d of a wrong post can turn into a full-blown diplomatic scandal.\n\nThe US Embassy in Turkey learned it the hard way on Saturday, after hitting the \u201clike\u201d button on a post, that speculated on health of Delvlet Bahceli \u2013 the leader of the nationalist MHP party and close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 who fell ill earlier this week. The politician was discharged from a hospital late on Saturday.\n\nThe message in question was quite unremarkable \u2013 and not even particularly offensive by social media standards. It suggested that the Turkish people \u201cshould get ready for a political era\u201d without Bahceli. Still, the message was clearly not something worth of a high-level diplomatic approval.\n\nTo make the matters worse, the original tweet was produced by Ergun Babahan \u2013 a Turkish journalist accused by Ankara of being a member of the so-called Fethullah Gullen Terrorist Organization (FETO). The journalist fled the country after the 2016 botched coup attempt and is now living in exile in Canada.\n\nVe tepki gelince begeniyi kaldirir \ud83d\ude21 muttefik mi munafik mi ? pic.twitter.com/ECdWWqetFf \u2014 1fanidunya \ud83d\udd4b\ud83d\udd4c\ud83c\udf19\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 (@ehlisunnet2023) October 5, 2019\n\nSuch an explosive mix prompted a blistering reaction from Turkish politicians, with the Presidential Communications Director Fahrettin Altun urging the US State Department to investigate the offensive \u201clike\u201d and punish those behind it.\n\n\u201cFreudian slip? The US Embassy has no business meddling in Turkey\u2019s domestic affairs,\u201d Altun wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe top-level attention to the embassy\u2019s social media flop prompted it to unlike the post and issue an apology.\n\n\u201cEarlier today our Embassy Twitter account \u201cliked\u201d an unrelated post in error. We regret the mistake and apologize for any confusion,\u201d the US Embassy said.\n\nEarlier today our Embassy Twitter account \u201cliked\u201d an unrelated post in error. We regret the mistake and apologize for any confusion. \u2014 US Embassy Turkey (@USEmbassyTurkey) October 5, 2019\n\nThis explanation has not convinced the Turkish officials, however. On Sunday, the Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the US Charge d\u2019Affaires and demanded an \u201copen and clear\u201d explanation regarding the cheeky like.\n\nErdogan\u2019s patty, the AKP, was not satisfied with the apology either. Its spokesman, Omer Celik, produced a whole Twitter thread about the misplaced like. Liking such posts is a \u201ccomplete violation of diplomatic practices,\u201d he fumed, adding that \u201cdry apology\u201d cannot fix what had been done and a proper investigation was needed.\n\n\u201cThe United States Embassy needs to try to understand Turkey not through people linked with terrorist organizations but through people who can conduct proper analysis,\u201d Celik raged on. \u201cNo embassies can comment in such way on any political party and politicians in Turkey. Respect for diplomatic practices is essential. Persons associated with terrorist organizations cannot be the source of an embassy.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018For futur of you\u2019re famly\u2019: FBI seeks to recruit \u2018Russian spies\u2019 with hilariously inept Facebook ad\n\nThe Embassy\u2019s blunder adds to the already strained relationship between the US and Turkey, that rapidly deteriorated after the failed 2016 coup. Ankara believes the controversial preacher Fethullah Gulen \u2013 who lives in the US \u2013 to be the mastermind behind the coup attempt, yet Washington has refused to surrender him to Turkey.\n\nAnkara\u2019s decision to buy Russian-made S-400 anti-aircraft systems despite Washington\u2019s strong objection to the deal has been another major issue between the two. The purchase has untimely resulted in the US scrapping a planned sale of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey, since the planes might be somehow \u201ccompromised\u201d by mere presence of Russian missile systems.\n\nAlso on rt.com Erdogan tells Trump he could ALSO buy US Patriot missiles despite row over Russian S-400s\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
