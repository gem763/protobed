I didn\u2019t set up a f***ing competition to find myself a girlfriend.\u2019\n\nYou just never know\u2026\n\nLewis flew two fans out to New York\n\nThe lucky fan was a student from Exeter, known as Jimmy, and was chosen as part of a competition marking the singer\u2019s partnership with Tinder.\n\nSince then, he has dished out his tips on the app, where he revealed that Titanic is his icebreaker.\n\n\u2018This is absolutely crucial. In the Tinder experience, you\u2019re letting this other person speak to you for the first time,\u2019 he said.\n\nThe star went on: \u2018Titanic. That\u2019s my ice breaker,\u2019 before he advised against using \u2018tragedies that killed thousands of people.\u2019\n\nLewis also insisted Tinder users not to wear sunglasses in their pictures as it just means the other person has no idea what you look like.\n\nAs part of his campaign, he\u2019ll be handing out further tickets to his 22 sold-out gigs around the UK. So that only means one thing, start swiping right for Lewis.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
