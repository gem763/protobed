As part of a collaboration between DGC Ontario and CBC Arts, a group of picture editors \u2014 responsible for piecing together everything from grand-scale literary adaptations to a rock 'n' roll doc brimming with archival footage \u2014 sat down to talk craft with The Filmmakers host Amanda Parris.\n\nMany of the panellists, when originally entering the industry, could not imagine becoming the editors behind movies premiering at one of the world's biggest film festivals. Some never even set out to become editors at all. Eamonn O'Connor (Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and The Band), Jorge Weisz (Castle in the Ground), Susan Shipton (Guest of Honour) and Kelley Dixon (The Goldfinch) got together on TIFF's opening weekend to share the advice that forever altered their career paths, get real about the editor's daily routine and pay tribute to the exciting work their peers in film and TV are producing right now.\n\nJorge Weisz on learning not to make it personal\n\nWhen editing a film, Jorge Weisz has learned not to take feedback or criticism personally. \"I'm there to take that vision of the director's to a higher place, to bring the work to the best possible incarnation.\" 1:40\n\nWhen Weisz was starting off as an editor, he often found himself fighting battles. \"At the beginning, I was very very protective of everything that I was doing. I was very proud of a cut and then the director would come and be like, 'No.'\"\n\nWeisz said that these disagreements would lead to \"ego fights.\" But he has now learned that feedback isn't personal and instead chooses to focus on bringing the director's vision to life.\n\n\"I'm there to take that vision of the director's to a higher place, to bring the work to the best possible incarnation.\"\n\nEamonn O'Connor thinks 'all editors are part therapist'\n\n\"I think that all editors are part therapists too\", says Once Were Brothers editor Eamonn O'Connor. 0:42\n\nThe Once Were Brothers editor said, \"There's often a dynamic between directors and producers after many years, especially in documentaries. So sometimes we have to navigate that.\"\n\nO'Connor, who has made a career cutting an assortment of music-centric documentaries, explained that in these situations he likes to reassure the director that he is there to help them make \"the best thing possible.\"\n\nWhy Kelley Dixon left Better Call Saul (despite the angry Redditors)\n\nBreaking Bad and Better Call Saul editor Kelley Dixon: \"The only way that you can open yourself up for something coming is to let something go.\" 5:11\n\nAfter a quick Google search, Dixon, who spent years working as an editor on Breaking Bad and its spinoff Better Call Saul, discovered that she had irritated some Redditors when she left the franchise. \"People were like, 'Why is she still doing the Better Call Saul Podcast if she's not on the show?'\"\n\nDixon said she was surprised to see people taking time out of their day to talk about her. \"I'm always very baffled and perplexed by the amount of visibility that I have,\" she said.\n\nBut despite what people say, Dixon knows she made the right decision to leave Better Call Saul. \"What I realized right around the end of season two \u2014 starting in season three \u2014 was that I was stagnating as an editor.\"\n\n\"The only way that you can open yourself up for something coming is to let something go,\" she said.\n\nWatch the entire panel here:", "description": "Eamonn O'Connor, Jorge Weisz, Susan Shipton\u00a0and Kelley Dixon on what it takes to make it in the industry.", "authors": ["Cbc Arts"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285854.1568666321!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tiff-picture-editors-panel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
