Can't people pay for their own flights?'\n\nMelissa replied: 'Well, if they don't know where they're going...,' which is when a bridesmaid slipped up and said: 'The only thing is he's booked it in Paris'.\n\nQuickly interjecting, Shanise tried to cover up her friend's mistake and asked: 'How do we know it's Paris? I don't get it'.\n\nAlthough the bridal party knew they would be travelling abroad, they were supposed to have no idea where they were going - leading the producers to conclude the pair had been communicating via email.\n\nThe bridesmaids later visited Yanis' house for what they thought was their dress fitting, however, they were stopped by producers mid-way through their chat.\n\nThe show's producer said: 'Okay guys I'm going stop you there. We normally would do a bridesmaids reveal but it's come to our attention that the secret appears to be out and the bridal party know about some of the plans for the wedding.'\n\nProducers confronted the bridesmaids (pictured) at their dress fitting and asked what they knew about the wedding\n\nAfter being quizzed on what they knew about the big day, bridesmaid Chantelle said: 'I know about Chris not coming and that p****d me off'.\n\nAnd although she originally vehemently denied knowing anything, Kayla eventually admitted: 'Yeah we do know.'\n\nShanise (pictured) was in disbelief upon hearing the news she wouldn't be getting married\n\nAfter asking Yanis how the pair were communicating, he confessed: 'Shanise got access to my iPad with my emails in there. So technically the bride wasn't told she found out through email.'\n\nAfter storming off into the kitchen Yanis gathered himself and told Shanise the bad news on the phone: 'It's not good...It's not going ahead', he said.\n\nShanise, in disbelief, asked: 'What the hell - what happens now? I need to know - is there a wedding or not?'\n\nShe was then left in tears after being told by producers: 'I know this is difficult but the rules have been broken and we are going to have to cancel this wedding.'\n\nA week later, the couple reflected on their time on the show and confessed they were 'heartbroken' and had found it hard to 'cope' with the aftermath of breaking the rules.\n\n'The last couple of days have been quite difficult,' said Shanise. 'The first night - although we had each other - it was like \"what is happening?\" It was very heartbreaking.'\n\nYanis went on to explain: 'I try not to think about it. I'm trying to detach myself from the whole situation and what's happened. I understand what Shanise did...I don't agree with it. It wasn't the right thing to do. '\n\nYanis (pictured) then had to call his fianc\u00e9 and tell her they would no longer be getting married due to the rule-breaking\n\nThe groom had to take a minute to calm down in the kitchen before he could break the news to his wife-to-be", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Yanis and Shanise, from Birmingham, were left devastated when their  'Don't Tell The Bride' wedding was called off  after they were caught communicating.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/16/19211458-0-image-a-3_1570028436034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
