Such nationality switches are a sore point for track\u2019s international governing body.\n\nFor years the IAAF has been trying to shut down what its council member Hamad Kalkaba Malboum likened in 2017 to a \u201cwholesale market for African talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have athletes being traded, it\u2019s bordering on trafficking if you\u2019re not careful,\u201d IAAF president Sebastian Coe told The Associated Press in August. \u201cI\u2019ve had member federation presidents who have said to me openly that they were waking up to emails from people saying \u2018We\u2019ve got so and so (who) is available for \u2026\u2019 You can\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nQatar\u2019s team has athletes originally from at least six other countries including Britain, Nigeria and Egypt. Qatar offers athletes advanced training facilities and a chance to shine. The new arrivals generally don\u2019t have prior ties to the nation.\n\nIn a country where native Qataris are vastly outnumbered by migrant workers, whether Bangladeshis on construction sites or service workers from the Philippines, relying on imported talent is nothing new.\n\nQatar\u2019s two-time Olympic high jump medalist Mutaz Barshim was born in the country, but sometimes Qatar and other nations seem to behave like professional soccer clubs rather than national teams.\n\nThe IAAF has reported Ashraf Amjad Al-Saifi was \u201cspotted\u201d when winning the Egyptian youth title in hammer throw aged 15 and handed a Qatari passport a few months later in 2011. New IAAF rules aim to prevent a repeat with a three-year waiting period to compete for a new nation.\n\nIn the Kenyan town of Iten, known as the \u201cUniversity of Champions\u201d for training star distance runners, Qatar promised to build a stadium after naturalizing Kenyan runner Stephen Cherono, later known as Saif Saaeed Shaheen. The track was to bear the tartan pattern found on local people\u2019s cloaks.\n\nAlthough Shaheen brought Qatar onto the international track stage with world championship gold medals in 2003 and 2005, no stadium was ever built.\n\nRenato Canova, an Italian distance coach who formerly trained Qatar\u2019s team and now works in Kenya, argues athletes have the right to switch to escape tough competition for squad places at home.\n\n\u201cThe country of course is not happy when you change citizenship, but the point of view is the individual point of view. It\u2019s not that the federation here is guilty, there are thousands of athletes, and it\u2019s not possible to assist everybody,\u201d Canova told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWhen we speak about World Championships and Olympics, those that involve all the world, then the athletes have the right to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the IAAF froze all nationality switches in track and field. One of its concerns was that athletes were being traded by influential agents, without much say over which country they represented.\n\nThe IAAF has also fought to ensure naturalized athletes get full citizenship rights. That didn\u2019t always happen in the past, leaving them at risk of being abandoned if their performances dropped.\n\nThere are signs that the pressure on some naturalized athletes leads them to break the rules. Since June, two Africa-born athletes for Bahrain have been banned for doping, including Olympic marathon silver medalist Eunice Kirwa. A third was pulled from worlds for an investigation into missed drug tests.\n\nIt\u2019s not only Arab nations fielding athletes who\u2019ve switched allegiance.\n\nThe Netherlands has Sifan Hassan, who arrived from Ethiopia as a 15-year-old refugee and gained Dutch nationality five years later. On Sunday, she became world champion in the 10,000 meters.\n\nBorn in Iten, Paul Chelimo won the Olympic silver at 5,000 for the United States but had to serve in the U.S. Army on his way to gaining citizenship.\n\nSpeaking during training Kenya before the world championships, he was sure he made the right choice. \u201cI\u2019m happy I made the decision, because I would not have had such a good chance here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMutwiri Mutuota in Nairobi, Kenya and Jerome Pugmire in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Just as migrant workers built Qatar's stadiums, a foreign-born medalist is building its reputation in track.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "James Ellingworth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/qatar_athletics_worlds_11719_c0-225-5079-3186_s1770x1032.jpg?c147b1084e3960265ed2a660ce688ab45d3a000b", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
