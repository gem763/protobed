He says the company is in a state of \"extreme overvaluation,\" citing concerns with its acquisitions, corporate management and company insiders selling stock in recent weeks.\n\n\"Of the 19 analysts that cover the stock, only four are a buy \u2013 and it's trading above the average analyst price target,\" Axler told CNBC. \"We could see this stock down 50%.\"\n\nSpruce Point is an activist investment fund that short sells stock of companies that it believes are trading at higher values than they should. Short selling is a means of betting that a company's stock will fall.\n\nShares of Church & Dwight have slid over 8% since Spruce Point released its report, trading as low as $72.84 a share on Monday. The company issued a statement to CNBC, denouncing Axler's report.\n\n\"We have confidence in our long-term plan to deliver superior returns based on our 'evergreen business model,' and our strong second-quarter results demonstrate our continued momentum. This report contains a number of false and misleading statements and is simply an attempt by a short-seller to negatively impact Church & Dwight's share price for its own benefit,\" Church & Dwight said.\n\nAxler acknowledged the company's response to CNBC and countered that Church & Dwight can call them if the company wants to identify and explain what those \"false and misleading statements\" are.\n\n\"We're happy to correct [any issues in our report] if they can prove us wrong,\" Axler said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Spruce Point Capital founder Ben Axler published a report last week expressing \"significant concerns\" about Church & Dwight.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106119833-1568050666243gettyimages-1081730800.jpeg?v=1568050697", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
