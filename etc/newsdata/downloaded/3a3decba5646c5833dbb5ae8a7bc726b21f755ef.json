Mr Mumtaz left behind a pregnant wife and a 14-month-old child.\n\nTabraz Mohammed, 39, lured 24-year-old Soheil Mumtaz (pictured) to a meeting then repeatedly hit him over the head with a hammer outside his home in Luton on April 4, 2001\n\nThe violent incident took place on Kenilworth Road in Luton. Mohammed fled the country to New Jersey, America after the attack where he lived in secret for nearly two decades\n\nMohammed was extradited from the United States on Tuesday, August 6 this year and he appeared at Luton Magistrates' Court the next day charged with murder.\n\nDuring a brief hearing at the Old Bailey today, Mohammed admitted murder and was told he would be sentenced on Tuesday, December 3.\n\nThe shaven headed killer wore a black and grey North Face jumper.\n\nAs he was led from the dock, there were angry shouts from the public gallery calling the defendant a 'p***k' and 'son of a b****'.\n\nMr Mumtaz's family paid tribute today, and said: 'Soheil was a loving husband and father who was cruelly taken from us.\n\n'We have suffered pain and hurt since that time and, whilst we are pleased that he has at last been brought to justice and has pleaded guilty, it does not make up for us continuing to live without a husband, father, brother and uncle. It will never diminish the pain.'\n\nAt a hearing at the Old Bailey (pictured) on Friday, Mohammed, whose last address was given as Southwood State Prison, New Jersey, pleaded guilty to murder\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Justine Jenkins from the BCH Major Crime Unit, who lead the investigation, said: 'This vicious attack was orchestrated on a husband and father in retribution for a perceived slight in remarks made, of which there is no direct evidence, to a member of Mohammed's family.\n\n'These were remarks not heard directly by Mohammed; in fact he didn't know if they were even true.\n\n'There is no honour in murder and his admission in court will hopefully provide some comfort for Mr Mumtaz's family, who have spent almost two decades without any closure.\n\n'Mohammed's cowardly flight out of the country meant he has never been held to account for his actions and only now will he finally face justice.'\n\nBritish and American authorities collaborated to bring Mohammed back to the United Kingdom after he was detained in Southward State Prison, New Jersey.\n\nMohammed, formally of Luton, admitted one count of murder and will be sentenced at St Alban's Crown Court on December 3.", "description": "Tabraz Mohammed, 39, attacked Soheil Mumtaz in the street in Luton for making advances towards his sister.
