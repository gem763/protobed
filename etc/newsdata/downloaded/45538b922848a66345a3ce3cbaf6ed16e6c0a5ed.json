But that doesn\u2019t mean the game isn\u2019t still getting updates. In fact, in November, World will receive arguably its strangest new content to date with a crossover featuring the undead world of Resident Evil.\n\nThe trailer for the crossover starts out normal enough, introducing Resident Evil mainstays Leon and Claire as playable characters. But then things get strange. There are now zombified hunters and monsters in World, along with a space that looks like a winter cabin mixed with a Resident Evil mansion. There\u2019s even a \u201cThriller\u201d-style zombie dance. The trailer ends with none other than Resident Evil 2\u2019s notorious Mr. X making an appearance, behaving in a much more wholesome manner than players will be accustomed to.\n\nOf course, Monster Hunter World is no stranger to these kinds of crossover events, with the likes of Horizon Zero Dawn\u2019s Aloy and Geralt from The Witcher making appearances in the game. But the Resident Evil mashup looks like it will take things to a whole new level. We know it\u2019s launching sometime next month, but we\u2019ll likely hear more details soon about when it will be available and what exactly the crossover will include.", "description": "Following the massive Iceborne expansion, Monster Hunter World is getting yet another update, this time in the form of a zombie-filled Resident Evil crossover.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xc3_pdwiqj3IrwYLcxlP1VIHFpo=/0x34:1367x750/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19259496/Screen_Shot_2019_10_04_at_11.42.00_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
