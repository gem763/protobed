The outfit is now rarely seen and is dominated by a voluminous draped brown-gold outer robe with long, wide sleeves and a cinched waist.\n\nRoyal attire often includes motifs of birds, as they were considered divine envoys in ancient times and the emperor\u2019s outer garment is decorated with a mythical Chinese phoenix, believed to symbolise the arrival of peace.\n\nThe crowning glory of the emperor\u2019s outfit is the kanmuri hat, which consists of a simple flat black base and a towering black tail at the back that extends upright 60 centimetres (about 24 inches).\n\nEmperor Naruhito leaves following a ceremony to proclaim his enthronement to the world, called Sokuirei-Seiden-no-gi, at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.

Japanese mythology has it that the sun goddess Amaterasu bequeathed the regalia to the imperial line two millennia ago.\n\nThe treasures are the \u201cYata no Kagami\u201d, a mirror, \u201cKusanagi no Tsurugi\u201d, a sword, and the \u201cYasakani no Magatama\u201d, an unspecified jewel.\n\nIt's time for China and Japan to end the bitterness\n\nThe possession of the \u201cthree sacred treasures\u201d is considered crucial evidence of an emperor\u2019s legitimacy, but there are no photos of them and even the emperor cannot see them.\n\nThe treasures were handed to the new emperor in the initial enthronement ceremony held on May 1.\n\nDuring the proclamation ceremony, a replica sword and the original jewel were brought in wrapped in cloth. Both are kept at the palace, along with a replica mirror that is not brought out for ceremonies.", "description": "World leaders gathered in Tokyo to witness Naruhito's enthronement, complete with sacred treasures and traditional outfits", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/empressmasako.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
