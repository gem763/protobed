Those officials say some Syrian Kurdish forces have moved north to fight Turkish troops who launched an attack across the border against the Kurds. The U.S. officials say other Kurds have stayed to guard the detention centers that hold thousands of IS militants.\n\nThe officials say the U.S. doesn\u2019t have good on-the-ground information about what\u2019s going on in some of the detention centers as American forces pull back from the border region.
