Tennis and polo matches are popular for sponsorship, too. That trend is accelerating as, in some cases (such as in Detroit), traditional auto shows have lost their luster.\n\nIn Irving, Texas, for instance, Apex Automotive partners with such brands as Hublot watches, the Dallas Symphony, and Core Water to put on automotive lifestyle events. Elite Auto Salon has sponsored similar events at Pikes Peak International Raceway in Colorado.\n\nIn San Diego in July, the Extreme Autofest Car Show and Lifestyle Festival included everything from a competitive car show to concert performances, a vendor village, and even a bikini contest. For the aftermarket crowd, Tuner Evolution at the Portland (Oregon) Expo Center brought together vendors and their products, celebrity appearances, and live band shows.\n\nThe events vary in appeal, of course, but they\u2019re unified in associating auto brands with exciting (and often upscale) lifestyles. Obviously, a charitable connection helps bring people in, too.\n\nLuxury sedan sales are down, victims of the SUV onslaught. As The Wall Street Journal reported last year, \u201cSedans, long a symbol of the American open road, are fading in the rearview mirror. In an industry-altering shift, millions of drivers have made what seems to be a complete embrace of sport-utility vehicles.\u201d\n\nAutomakers have adopted a \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2019em\u201d strategy and brands that once swore never to go off-roading are now fielding cars such as the Rolls-Royce Cullinan, Maserati Levante, and Lamborghini Urus. But few are abandoning passenger cars entirely, and lifestyle events are a great place to showcase the new sedan models. Hence the exclusive Rolls-Royce Phantom on display in Texas.\n\nThe Four Seasons Hotel in Irving offers a golf course, a full-service spa, two pools\u2014and the annual Park Place Luxury and Supercar Showcase. Now in its third year, it\u2019s a peculiarly Texas kind of show\u2014big\u2014combining a display of new models with a concours d\u2019elegance for classics and other attractions. This year\u2019s show takes place Sept. 28, and features a Mercedes-Benz beer garden, a fashion show, a Haute Hat Contest, the chance to sign up for cruises, live music, and food from 20 area restaurants.\n\nThis week, Rolls-Royce and McLaren (whose U.S. headquarters is soon to relocate to Dallas from New York) held a preview, and offered journalists a chance to drive the new models\u2014Rolls-Royce\u2019s Cullinan SUV and McLaren\u2019s 720S Spider convertible.\n\nIn case you were wondering why McLaren would relocate to Texas, consider that in 2017 the company sold 1,300 cars in North America. Some 85 of those sales were in Dallas-Fort Worth and 65 in Houston.\n\nKen Schnitzer is responsible for many of those Texas McLaren sales. He is chairman of Park Place Dealerships, a one-stop in north Texas for luxury cars\u2014it offers 17 brands (all of them upmarket), including McLaren, Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Porsche, Lexus, and Land Rover. Tiny supercar brands such as Koenigsegg and Karma are also sold. Schnitzer says the showcase is designed to \u201clet our customers experience great brands along with the lifestyle element\u2014fine food and music.\u201d\n\nA fashion show is part of the proceedings. Park Place photo\n\nAutomakers such as Rolls-Royce have to think about customer service, too. Gerry Spahn, the North American chief spokesperson for the brand, was at the Four Seasons event with two Cullinans and an exclusive Phantom\u2014the bespoke model that regularly sells as a highly personalized vehicle with a bottom line around $500,000 or $600,000.\n\nMcLaren was also in attendance in Texas, offering a ride in the 720S around Irving\u2019s upscale shopping malls.\n\nObviously, a McLaren SUV would play well in Dallas/Fort Worth, but Joseph says it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in the plans through 2025,\u201d says Tony Joseph, president of McLaren in North America.\n\nWhat McLaren will do, says McLaren communications vice president Roger Ormisher, is offer a sports grand touring GT car that under its rear hatch can accommodate full-sized sets of golf clubs. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally new segment for us,\u201d he says.\n\nThe 2020 model car will be on the market in October. Also coming is electrification. \u201cThat\u2019s being discussed,\u201d Joseph says. A fully electric car could come by 2025, at which point McLaren would also offer hybrid options in all of its model lines.\n\nName recognition for McLaren has happened quickly, but Joseph admitted, \u201cWe have a ways to go to increase awareness.\u201d Events such as the Park Place showcase are ideal, he says. McLaren doesn\u2019t yet have a U.S. experience center, as many other high-end brands do, but it does sponsor special events such as owner road rallies that end up at Pebble Beach. Thirty cars showed up for the rally this year.\n\nThe Phantom on display in Texas (no drives possible) had a price tag of $562,775, and the silver McLaren 600LT Spider, $289,320. These are not casual purchases, but Spahn and Joseph said that sometimes customers do buy them casually\u2014saying \u201cI\u2019ll take it\u201d at events such as Park Place. At Pebble Beach, two Rolls Phantoms found new owners in exactly that way.\n\nProspective purchasers want to see the cars in the metal\u2014rather than just online\u2014and it\u2019s obviously better if they can see them surrounded by the accoutrements of luxury living: food, wine, designer clothes, and high-end hotels.\n\nThe writer was a guest of Rolls-Royce.", "description": "Automakers are displaying their cars at lifestyle events featuring gourmet food, wine, and fashion", "authors": ["Jim Motavalli"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106655/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
