We are in negotiations at the moment. When there is the time and place to say what's happening, we'll all make it clear. And if not, you'll read it every July [when the BBC lists its highest-paid stars' salaries as part of its annual report].\n\n\"But I love working for the BBC. There are problems working for the BBC obviously because of what it is and what it entails, but it's a great place, and I'd hope to be here working with the BBC for many years to come.\"\n\nImage caption Lineker also fronts BT Sport's Champions League coverage\n\nHe also discussed how lucrative it can be covering football on television.\n\n\"I get paid a lot of money because it's a business, particularly around football and TV, that is very competitive, and it's very well paid,\" he said.\n\n\"There are pundits on Sky that in recent times are paid double what I'm on, and I'm not complaining about that. I wouldn't complain for one single minute.\"\n\nHe said he understood why some viewers feel his salary is very high.\n\n\"Of course I get that. I've always felt like that. I've felt incredibly fortunate. I felt like that when I was a footballer. And I feel like that as a broadcaster now.\n\n'Way beyond what you deserve'\n\n\"But you know, that's the market rate. That's what it's worth. And obviously, you could get bit more somewhere else.\n\n\"It is what it is, and it's the same whether you're a footballer or whether you're at the top of the entertainment world, or whether you're a singer, whether you're a top actor.\n\n\"You're paid money that is way beyond really what you deserve, but nobody's going to go, 'Actually, no, I'll for work for a pittance'. They're not going to do that. I always feel uncomfortable talking about it, but at the same time, I'm not complaining.\"\n\nHe was talking to promote a new book, and his comments follow a report in The Daily Mirror, which quoted him as saying: \"I'm currently negotiating a new contract with them and I'm \u00advolunteering to take less.\"\n\nLineker also works for BT Sport, fronting their Champions League football coverage.\n\nImage caption Gary Lineker with the FA Cup\n\nSpeaking about Lineker's pay earlier this year, BBC director general Tony Hall said the success of BBC Sport, which reaches 40% of the UK population, has \"much to do with Gary\", adding that he \"does an excellent job\".\n\nBBC chairman Sir David Clementi said he had \"seen no evidence we are paying anyone above the market rate\", adding: \"What I've seen suggests the opposite.\"\n\nLast year, six male BBC presenters, including Huw Edwards, John Humphrys and Jeremy Vine, agreed to take pay cuts.\n\nAside from Match of the Day, Lineker's other BBC work includes World Cup and European Championships coverage, and he has presented golf programmes.\n\n'Sickening press intrusion'\n\nHe also discussed the outcry over press stories about cricketer Ben Stokes and former rugby player Gareth Thomas this week.\n\nLineker told 5 Live: \"I thought after the hacking scandals it was almost like they [the papers] deliberately laid back a little bit or perhaps they couldn't find the information off someone's phone.\n\nThis week, newspapers faced a backlash after former rugby player Gareth Thomas revealed that journalists had forced him to go public with his HIV diagnosis.\n\nThen cricketer Ben Stokes condemned a front page story in the Sun about a tragedy in his family 31 years ago as \"immoral and heartless\".\n\n\"All of a sudden that reared its ugly head again this week. I just find it a bit sickening,\" Lineker said.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
