(AP Photo/John Amis)\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- In a one-run playoff loss, Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr.\u2019s lack of hustle was the obvious mistake the Atlanta Braves couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nAcu\u00f1a failed to run out a long flyball to right field in the seventh inning of the Braves\u2019 7-6 loss to St. Louis in Game 1 of the NL Division Series on Thursday night. He admired his drive as he carried his bat with him on his slow jog down the first-base line.\n\nThe bad news for Acu\u00f1a and the Braves: It was not a homer. The ball hit off the wall, and he had to settle for a single instead of a double.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter showing lack of hustle in an almost identical play on Aug. 18, Acu\u00f1a was pulled out of a 5-3 win over the Dodgers by manager Brian Snitker. Acu\u00f1a was contrite after that first mistake, and Snitker seemed convinced the 21-year-old All-Star learned his lesson.\n\nNo one was as quick to forgive Acu\u00f1a after the gaffe was repeated in the spotlight of the postseason opener.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating,\u201d star teammate Freddie Freeman said. \u201c... You've got to know you can't have that mistake. That can't happen in the playoffs. That can't happen in the regular season. Unfortunately, that happened.\u201d\n\nAcu\u00f1a\u2019s close friend, second baseman Ozzie Albies, said the lollygagging could have cost Atlanta a win. Albies said \u201ca couple guys\u201d spoke up in the clubhouse after the game to tell Acu\u00f1a \u201cjust run out of the box.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a chance to kill the inning,\u201d Albies said. \u201cWe probably score in that inning if he's at second base. It was a big chance in a tight ballgame.\u201d\n\nSpeaking through a translator, Acu\u00f1a insisted, \u201cI always try to give my best effort. Those things just kind of get away from me. So obviously I would love to have a double.\u201d\n\nAcu\u00f1a described his mistakes as \u201cthings only happen to guys who are on the bench. You get benched for that.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThis time, however, Snitker was running out of players and couldn\u2019t afford to remove Acu\u00f1a from the game as a disciplinary measure.\n\n\u201cHe should have been on second,\u201d Snitker said. \u201cAnd we're kind of short-handed to do anything about it right there. You hate to see that happen.\u201d\n\nAcu\u00f1a hit a two-run homer in the ninth and also admired the blast before flipping his bat. Freeman also homered as the Braves tried to rally from a 7-3 deficit.\n\nThe fact the Braves needed one more run to complete the comeback added more attention to Acu\u00f1a\u2019s mistake in the seventh.\n\nFreeman said players shouldn\u2019t have to be told more than once to run out of the box.\n\n\u201cI think you have that conversation once,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cYou're going to beat a dead horse after you keep having that same conversation over and over again.\u201d\n\nSnitker said he had not yet had the opportunity to speak with his young star. Albies said it\u2019s crucial that Acu\u00f1a understands the message.\n\n\u201cIt's a big deal,\u201d Albies said. \u201cHe needs to do better there.\u201d\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "In a one-run playoff loss, Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr.\u2019s lack of hustle was the obvious mistake the Atlanta Braves couldn\u2019t afford.
