She said she had worked with Instagam alongside \"a host of other experts\" to help formulate the policy.\n\nThis is just the beginning of our efforts at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I WEIGH\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but for now, it has been incredible to work alongside Instagram and their experts to create policies to protect people from irresponsible influencers who sell bogus products to their followers.

Instagram deleted all three, apparently in response to public complaints, but subsequently apologised to Kardashian West for doing so.\n\n\"We want Instagram to be a positive place for everyone that uses it and this policy is part of our ongoing work to reduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel as a result of social media,\" Instagram's UK public policy manager Emma Collins said in a statement.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The new policy was formulated in conjunction with actress Jameela Jamil, a vocal opponent of the diet and detox industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/396/b0d68bdb9530467a82a03b3b1dd16203.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
