In Electrify America\u2019s announcement, it notes that the vehicle \u201chas a targeted EPA-estimated range of 300 miles with an extended battery and rear-wheel drive.\u201d\n\nSo far, Ford has only said that it is targeting a 300-mile range for the sporty model, not which wheels are driven, or if it will be offered with multiple battery sizes. The automaker has not commented on the slip, but Electrify America has since deleted the reference from its website. High-performance cars like the actual Ford Mustang typically feature rear-biased drivetrains to give them sportier dynamics.\n\n\u201cExtended battery pack\u201d suggests that a standard version with less range and a lower price will be in the mix, similar to Tesla\u2019s lineup of electric vehicles. As an SUV, it\u2019s also likely that it will come in an all-wheel-drive version. Ford hasn\u2019t said as much, but the video it released of a prototype electric vehicle shows it being tested on a snow-covered track.\n\nFull details could come as early as November, when the electric SUV is expected to officially debut.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Spoiler alert.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
