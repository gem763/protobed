How should people talk about obesity? And should it be celebrated?\n\nJohn Wass, a Professor of Endocrinology and an Obesity Empowerment Network member who was a consultant to the series, says he hopes the show will kick-start a very important national debate.\n\nHe says: \u201cWe are living through a global pandemic, where obesity is now considered a bigger problem than world hunger.\n\n\u201cThe series explores a number of crucial medical and policy issues, and also promotes empathy and understanding. The cure is not as simple as just eating less and exercising more.\n\n\u201cWe now know science is identifying genes that contribute to weight and obesity by affecting appetite.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cThere are also people in the series who describe themselves as body positive, a small but increasingly vocal movement in \u2018fat politics\u2019 that responds to years of stigma and discrimination.\n\n\u201cIt is important we hear and understand all points of view in this often heated debate.\u201d\n\nSo to get you ready, here\u2019s our guide to the residents\u2026\n\nDavid, 24, Essex\n\nPlus-size model, influencer and graphic design student David says he is \u201cfat, successful and happy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI love myself!\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t look like everyone else because I\u2019m not. The fact no one is me is my superpower.\n\n\u201cWeight and size shouldn\u2019t determine respect or self-worth.\u201d\n\nDavid, battling for plus-size fashion on the high street, says he took part because so few men are willing to speak out. He says: \u201cPeople should watch because it\u2019s time we got an honest perspective on being a plus-size person.\u201d\n\nBabs, 50, Sussex\n\nThe prison supervisor is a serial dieter with a binge-eating disorder, struggling with her weight since childhood.\n\n\u201cI started to gain weight when my parents separated when I was six or seven,\u201d she says. \u201cI found comfort in food. I was 12st when I was 12 and at my heaviest I was nearly 28st at 40.\u201d\n\nBabs, who fears ridicule, got type 2 diabetes and was told to lose weight. She is in the series to raise awareness of mental health around obesity.\n\nShe says: \u201cIt\u2019s time to recognise eating disorders come in many forms, not just bulimia and anorexia, and we don\u2019t need to be constantly told to eat less and move more.\u201d\n\nSarah, 37, Yorkshire\n\nA campaigner to end the stigma obesity weight, Sarah has had a rollercoaster journey with her weight.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nShe shed 8st and did a triathlon after appearing on an extreme weight loss TV series in 2012. But when filming ended, it was a battle to keep the weight off. Now, she is the director of charity Obesity UK and wants the condition recognised as a disease.\n\n\u201cI want to change the narrative,\u201d she says. \u201cI want people to see people with obesity are not just lazy and eat too much. It\u2019s much more complex.\n\n\u201cI have struggled with my weight my whole life. I still don\u2019t like my body, but I am more at peace with myself.\u201d\n\nJed, 29, Yorkshire\n\nThe stand-up comic\u2019s motto is \u201cHere for a good time, not a long time\u201d. During filming, he took the group to watch a gig, where his fat jokes were put under the microscope.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cSome days I\u2019m comfortable in my body, other days I hate it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not happy. I want to change who I appear to be. Other days I appreciate my depth as a human and understand my differences.\u201d\n\nHaving always avoided GP visits for fear of what he might be told, the series encourages him to get a diabetes test and vow to attend medical checks. He says: \u201cSome people look after cars better than I\u2019ve looked after my health.\"\n\nDel, 56, Cambridgeshire\n\nHitting 25st five years ago, Del opted for bariatric surgery and has now lost 10st and runs marathons.\n\nHe says: \u201cMy journey from morbid obesity and weight-related illnesses to great medication-free health has already inspired others. I was in a dark place, now I\u2019m in the best shape ever.\u201d\n\nSales director Del has even climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and run the London Marathon since his operation.\n\nHe says: \u201cI wanted to show that by eating less and doing more physical activity, which I now do, there are more benefits than just being able to fit into a pair of skinny jeans. Your health truly is your wealth.\u201d\n\nMiranda, 38, London\n\nThe writer, performer and comedian calls herself a \u201cfat activist\u201d and wants to change perceptions of fat people.\n\nLosing weight 10 years ago didn\u2019t bring her happiness, so she decided to switch her focus from weight loss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been fat. Not only that, but I was the fattest. But being thin didn\u2019t make me happy. It just meant I could buy more clothes.\u201d\n\nMiranda, who doesn\u2019t think obesity should be labelled a disease, now runs club nights and social events for plus-size people and wants more fat people represented on TV. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of seeing fat girls as just the \u2018funny best friend\u2019 or the one desperate to diet.\u201d\n\nCourtney, 26, Lincolnshire\n\nAfter several extreme diets that left her ill throughout her teens, carer Courtney found the BoPo (body positivity) community five years ago.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t look in the mirror,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my eyes, I wasn\u2019t good enough unless I was thin. Even after losing 5st it wasn\u2019t enough. I spent a long time hating myself.\u201d She is now a self-love advocate and prolific Instagrammer who believes in accepting your size.\n\n\u201cI took part because I want to change the stigma surrounding fat people. I want an end to fat shaming, body shaming and to show that body positivity and health can fit together.\u201d\n\nJack, 31, Cheshire\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nWhen he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes last year, Jack was scared for his future and decided to finally take action.\n\nHe began eating more healthily and started an exercise regime, and is now losing weight. \u201cMy weight had ballooned to 24-and-a-half stone. I feel it is largely a consequence of my own actions. I want to show that some fat people actually want to take ownership and accountability.\u201d\n\nHGV driver Jack frequently battles Victoria in the series when she claims obesity doesn\u2019t mean ill-health. He invited a type 2 diabetes sufferer to the house to talk about how the disease led to his leg being amputated last year.\n\nVictoria, 34, Canada\n\nThe body confidence coach and fat activist is very vocally anti-diet.\n\nAfter battling low self-esteem and body image issues, she identifies as an \u201cintuitive eater\u201d \u2013 meaning she eats what she wants, when she wants.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nShe thinks fat and health are not related and dislikes the words \u201cobesity\u201d and \u201coverweight\u201d. She says: \u201cFat people are dying because of the stigma and lack of care in this fatphobic society.\n\n\u201cI spent my life trying to diet my way to worthiness. It didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cI hope people will take away from this series that fat people are all different. It\u2019s OK to be fat.\u201d", "description": "BBC documentary Who Are You Calling Fat? will see nine people move into a house in Oxfordshire for a week to weigh up the big issues", "authors": ["Sara Wallis", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716928.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Who-Are-You-Calling-Fat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
