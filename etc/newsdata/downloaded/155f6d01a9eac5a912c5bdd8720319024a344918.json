The officials said this did not present any significant risk to public health.\n\nRussian online media published an unattributed video which journalists said showed a line of ambulances speeding through Moscow to take the injured to a centre that specialises in the treatment of radiation victims.\n\nRosatom said that the injured were being treated at a \"specialised medical centre\".\n\nIodine panic\n\nAn expert from Moscow's Institute for Nuclear Research, Boris Zhuikov, told RBK independent news site that isotope power sources are not usually dangerous for people working with them.\n\n\"If they are damaged, people who are nearby could be hurt. Isotope sources use various types of fuel: plutonium, promethium or cerium,\" Zhuikov said.\n\nThe radioactivity levels involved are \"absolutely not comparable with those during serious accidents at reactors,\" he added.\n\nNews of the accident prompted residents of Severodvinsk to rush to pharmacies to stock up on iodine, which can be taken to prevent the thyroid gland absorbing radiation.\n\n\"People started to panic. Within a matter of an hour all the iodine and iodine-containing drugs were sold out,\" pharmacist Yelena Varinskaya told AFP.\n\nThe Soviet Union saw the world's worst nuclear accident at Chernobyl in 1986, when the authorities sought to cover up the seriousness of the disaster.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
