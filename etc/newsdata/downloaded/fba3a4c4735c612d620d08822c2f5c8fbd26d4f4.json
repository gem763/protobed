Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) who looked very much like a \u201cno\u201d vote decided to not be bullied by the progressive left and vote in favor of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court. This clinches the ball game. Flake and Manchin are also yea votes. While Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) will be away from D.C. for his daughter\u2019s wedding, he can always hop on a plane to fly back if needed. If this count holds, Kavanaugh can get across the finished line with 50 votes. It\u2019s over. We won, the Democrats lost, and it\u2019s a great day for America.\n\nAlso, while Trump\u2019s 2016 win was great, this one is special. Collins vote gives conservatives the biggest win for a generation. We have a solid majority on SCOTUS. Sen. Klobuchar and others will continue to deliver speeches within the 30-hour period before the final vote tomorrow. We\u2019ll be back with more updated in a bit. For now, go have a drink, grab some dinner, and celebrate the massive meltdown liberals are experiencing right now. Debating whether to send Michael Avenatti a gift basket for pushing the Left to overreach on this blitz against Kavanaugh.\n\nSee you in a bit!", "description": "Townhall.com features Political Blogs, Conservative Blogging, the Republican Blogspot, Write your own Blog, Post Comments, over one million Bloggers\" /><meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Political, Conservative, Republican, Blogs, Blogging, Bloggers, Blogspot, Townhall.com, Townhall, Town Hall, Write your own blog, post comments.09/02/2019 3:15:37AM EST.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2018/278/7a19cc39-2c3e-4946-829c-67ee3b57e1c9.png"}
