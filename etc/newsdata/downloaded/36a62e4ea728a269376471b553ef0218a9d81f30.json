Here's what you need to know as you start your Monday and the new week...\n\n'Taliban overreached': Pompeo tells Fox News key reason why meeting at Camp David was called off\n\nPeace talks between the U.S. and leaders from Afghanistan and the Taliban have been called off after the Taliban admitted they were behind a deadly bombing in Kabul last week that resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this Sunday the Taliban \u201coverreached\u201d and showed that they cannot be trusted to move forward with a peace process at this point in time. \u201cWhat they did here was they tried to use terror to improve their negotiating position,\u201d he told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump revealed the existence of the planned talks and their cancellation Saturday night, announcing that he had intended to hold a secret meeting at Camp David on Sunday, but called it off due to the Taliban\u2019s role in the attack. Chris Wallace, host of \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d pressed Pompeo about the idea that the president of the United States was willing to meet with the Taliban on U.S. soil just days before Sept. 11. The secretary did not address the timing but defended inviting the Taliban to Camp David.

Leading ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., believes they are committing a \"travesty.\" Democrats on the committee are planning on voting on how the investigation is defined, through a resolution that would set the boundaries of the probe, Politico reported. Collins pointed out what he believes are problems with how Democrats have conducted their investigation, claiming that they have acted outside the boundaries of House rules and may have made misrepresentations in court filings. \u201cThey have portrayed themselves in just a terrible way over the last eight months and they keep digging their hole,\" Collins told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Click on the video above to watch the interview.\n\nGuns, impeachment push, border wall: What's in store as Congress returns from recess\n\nAs Congress heads back to work on Monday in Washington after a six-week recess, lawmakers who already have struggled to pass substantive legislation this term are set to grapple with a slew of combustible issues, ranging from trade deals and border wall funding to gun control and impeachment proceedings. With an already heated presidential cycle in full swing, experts have said the political landscape would afford little hope for legislative compromise, but plenty of opportunity for gamesmanship and stonewalling. To top it all off, lawmakers also need to fund the government by Oct. 1 to avert another shutdown.\n\nStudents form human protest chains as Hong Kong tells US to mind its business\n\nThousands of students formed human chains outside schools across Hong Kong on Monday to show solidarity to push for democratic reforms after violent weekend clashes in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The silent protest comes as the Hong Kong government condemned the \"illegal behavior of radical protesters\" and warned the U.S. to stay out of its affairs. Thousands of demonstrators held a peaceful march Sunday to the U.S. Consulate to seek Washington's support, but violence erupted later in the day in a business and retail district. - The Associated Press\n\nBig Tech in antitrust probe crosshairs\n\nTech giants are facing greater legal risks than ever before, opening up the possibility that they may have to pay big money to resolve probes alleging unfair business practices against them.

Trump blasted the singer and his wife \u201cfor talking now about how great\u201d the reform is, but not playing a role when it mattered. Trump signed the First Step Act into law last year that reduces mandatory minimum sentences in certain instances and gives judges more discretion. More than 3,100 inmates will be released under the act, which has been praised by both Republicans and Democrats. Legend responded to Trump\u2019s tweet by appealing to the first lady Melania Trump.
