She has helped catalog museum collections, and assisted police with forensic analyses. But UVic students will no longer benefit from her expertise, and her ability to apply for research grants has come to a screeching halt. In May, the Anthropology Department withdrew her Adjunct Professor status, depriving her of a university affiliation.\n\nCrockford describes her expulsion as \u201can academic hanging without a trial, conducted behind closed doors.\u201d After being renewed unanimously in 2016 for a three-year term, her adjunct status was not renewed the next time around.\n\nCrockford is the author of a popular blog, polarbearscience.com, as well as five books about these animals. Polar Bear Facts and Myths has been translated into four languages. She says that, contrary to the claims of environmental activists, polar bears are currently thriving and are at no risk of extinction from climate change.\n\nInforming the public of these plain facts now appears to be unacceptable to UVic. After 15 years, Crockford was advised in May that an internal Appointment Reappointment Promotion and Tenure (ARPT) committee had \u201cvoted not to renew your Adjunct Status.\u201d No reasons were provided. Having undergone hip surgery in the interim, Crockford is only now going public.\n\nWhen contacted by the National Post recently, UVic spokesman Paul Marck refused to say how many people were on the ARPT committee, how many voted against Crockford, or how many were zoologists in a position to make an informed decision about her abilities.\n\nThe position of Adjunct Professor is unpaid. In exchange for mentoring students, sitting on thesis committees, and delivering occasional lectures, adjuncts gain official academic standing and full access to library research services. When asked what safeguards ensure that adjuncts can\u2019t be excommunicated merely for expressing unpopular ideas, spokesman Marck declined to respond, citing provincial privacy legislation. In his words, the university doesn\u2019t disclose \u201cinformation about internal processes. We must respect the privacy rights of all members of our campus community.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the university is not protecting Crockford\u2019s right to privacy. Instead, it is using a privacy smokescreen to protect members of a committee who have decided to purge an adjunct professor without reason or explanation.\n\nAbsent any other plausible explanation, Crockford has concluded that she was removed in order to suppress views on polar bears and related climate change issues and prevent her from continuing to challenge the high-profile academics who claim polar bear populations are in crisis.\n\nG. Cornelis van Kooten, a UVic professor of economics who also holds a Canada Research Chair in environmental studies, says he is \u201cappalled and distressed\u201d by the Crockford removal. When, he asks, did \u201cuniversities turn against open debate? There\u2019s now a climate of fear on campus.\u201d\n\nAcademia is a \u201cpublish or perish\u201d workplace, and Crockford is an accomplished scholar. Last year, she was co-author of a paper published in Science, one of the world\u2019s most prestigious scientific journals. On any campus, the number of professors whose recent work appears in that journal is small. Once again citing privacy concerns, UVic spokesman Marck declined to tell the National Post how many other UVic professors have met this high standard.\n\nCrockford says she isn\u2019t entirely surprised by her expulsion, given her previous ban from the UVic Speakers Bureau. For the better part of a decade, that entity had arranged for her to deliver unpaid lectures to elementary and high school students, as well as to adult community groups. One talk concerned the early origins of domestic dogs. The other was titled Polar Bears: Outstanding Survivors of Climate Change.\n\nThere is every indication she was a popular speaker. But in 2017, UVic Speakers Bureau co-ordinator Mandy Crocker advised her of a policy change. The chair of the Anthropology Department now needed to confirm that Crockford was \u201cable to represent the university\u201d when discussing these topics.\n\nCrockford\u2019s 2004 dissertation broke new ground with regard to the mechanisms by which wolves evolved into domestic dogs. UVic awarded her a PhD for that research. Yet 13 years later, Dr. Ann Stahl, as Chair of the Anthropology Department, banned Crockford from telling members of the public about it as a representative of the school.\n\nIn April 2017, Stahl advised: \u201cI will not be endorsing your request to be included in the Speakers Bureau roster for 2017-2018.\u201d Admitting that she couldn\u2019t prevent Crockford from speaking elsewhere as a private citizen, Stahl drew the line at her doing so \u201cas a representative of UVic.\u201d\n\nStahl said she respected \u201cissues of academic freedom,\u201d but Crockford\u2019s talks at schools had \u201cgenerated concern among parents regarding balance\u201d and that this concern had \u201cbeen shared with various levels of the university.\u201d Stahl did not respond to a request by the National Post for an interview.\n\nThat was the first time Crockford was made aware of any problems. Because no one from the Speakers Bureau or the Anthropology Department has ever advised her of any specific complaint, she was never given an opportunity to defend herself.\n\nThe Speakers Bureau draws its volunteers from UVic \u201cfaculty, staff, graduate students and retirees.\u201d Prospective speakers complete a form on its website, which says nothing about departmental approval. There is no suggestion that presentations must be balanced, and many appear to be overtly political.\n\nFor example, Social Studies associate professor Jason Price currently delivers a lecture titled Education and the Revolution: Climate Change and the Curriculum of Life, to students as young as kindergarten age. Patrick Makokoro, a UVic graduate student, offers a presentation to audiences as young as 10 about social justice.\n\nDwight Owens, an employee of Ocean Networks Canada, an entity affiliated with UVic, has no scientific training. His BA is in Chinese language and literature. His MA is in educational technology. Nevertheless, under the auspices of the UVic Speakers Bureau, he has been giving talks about ocean chemistry and climate change for years.\n\nThe National Post asked UVic spokesman Marck how many people have been forbidden from participating in the Speakers Bureau, and what mechanisms are in place to vet presentations about controversial topics. Marck refused to address either of these matters. Speakers Bureau co-ordinator Crocker also declined to be interviewed.\n\nCurrent and former UVic faculty members contacted by the National Post aren\u2019t aware of any vetting process. Currently, therefore, there is no evidence that even inexperienced graduate students need permission to \u201crepresent the university.\u201d That requirement appears to have been invented solely as a means of silencing the eminently qualified, highly experienced Crockford.\n\nBecause her polar bear message conflicts with activist rhetoric, and because activists apparently complained to administrators, her career as an academic researcher has come to an abrupt end.\n\nJeffrey Foss, a former chair of UVic\u2019s philosophy department, says Crockford has been punished for speaking her own mind about matters of fact, which means she has been denied academic freedom and free speech. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to lose faith and hope in the university system,\u201d he says.\n\nDuring the time she delivered lectures to elementary school students, Crockford says she was continually \u201castonished to learn that every single teacher believed that only a few hundred to a few thousand polar bears were left.\u201d She feels duty bound as a scientist to speak up, to point out that the global population is officially estimated to be in the range of 22,000 to 31,000 and may be much higher. \u201cI talk to groups about the adaptive features of polar bears that allow them to survive changes in their Arctic habitat,\u201d she says.\n\nThis week, Crockford will begin a five-country European speaking tour. Audiences in Oslo, London, Paris, Amsterdam and Munich will hear about her research, evaluate her arguments, and draw their own conclusions.\n\nThe University of Victoria needs to explain why it has allowed an internal committee to secretly purge and thereby punish an internationally-recognized researcher, for no known reason other than the fact that some unknown accusers do not agree with her views.\n\nDonna Laframboise blogs at BigPicNews.com and is the author of two books about the UN\u2019s climate report generator, the IPCC.", "description": "Opinion: Dr. Susan Crockford describes her expulsion from the University of Victoria as 'an academic hanging without a trial, conducted behind closed doors'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/crockford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
