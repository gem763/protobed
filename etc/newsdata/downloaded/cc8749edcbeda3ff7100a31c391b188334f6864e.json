Cool, took it in your stride. What I'd like to continue is a strong leg action for more fluidity, you're a great performer but I want you to start working on flow.'\n\nReferencing Kelvin's killer hip action, Alfonso told him: 'It's great to be back, but it's better to see that! As a race car driver, there's a thing called driving fro mtge seat of your car, and the seat of your car had the ladies hot!'\n\nWow! They were back to work their dance magic to Aston Merrygold's Get Stupid as they took to the floor to perform a fast-paced Cha Cha Cha\n\nQuick to put a damper on the complementary chat, Craig added: Thought you were a little bit stiff, it's what Shirley was suggesting but I get booed!\n\nMosti told them: 'You have such great foot speed, and there were so many rhythms of Cha Cha, you had everything in place! You kept the energy, you gave me flirty, you gave me oh-oh that's what I need for a Cha Cha!'\n\nDuring their sexy routine Cheryl was spotted in the audience.\n\nHowever ahead of the live show Oti had a surprise for Kelvin as she organised for Aston to accompany them in training\n\nFollowing the routine Kelvin said: 'I was so nervous! I didn't know the steps as I was going into it.' Also noting that his brother was watching from the audience, he said: 'He's my best mate I idolise him!'\n\nKelvin and Oti continued to rule the leaderboard as they were awarded 33 in total from the judges.\n\nAfter being spotted looking cosy David and Nadiya were back to try and champion the Jive.\n\nKilling it: After being spotted looking cosy David and Nadiya were back to try and champion the Jive\n\nReferencing their close friendship, David joked during training: 'It's fun, which is apart of the problem because the fun gets in the way of the learning. Nadiya added: 'We've had loads of fun but now we need to get serious and enjoy it.'\n\nFollowing the routine, Alfonso said: 'It's got to be really hard at 6'5 to do the Jive. You made a couple of mistakes but one of the things I want you to do is just scream - let it out! David screams. Just let it go, have some fun and let it all hang out.'\n\nCraig added: 'No amount of screaming is going to fix that, it was full of timing issues and mistakes. Because you're so tall you have to be ahead of the beat. It needs more energy. Your body is moving much more freely though.'\n\nMotsi: If you looked good at the upper half I was pleased, there were a lot of mistakes but you couldn't see it in your face so your stage presence is improving. We need the upper and lower half on point.\n\nShirley: You had good basic content, and what had improved was when you made mistakes you picked up and moved up. I applaud your efforts.", "description": "Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse were first to take to the dance floor after sweeping three nines during last week's routine, but still managed to only bag second place.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/19/19933824-0-image-a-39_1571510361580.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
