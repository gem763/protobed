Add Interest\n\nLess than half an hour into the family's hike near Myrtle Falls at Mount Rainier National Park on Sunday, a small bear wandered up to Jasmine Bartley's teenage brother, according to ABC News Seattle affiliate KOMO.\n\nBartley said she heard a woman behind her audibly gasp, turned around and saw the bear just a few feet away from her brother. Everyone else behind him ran up a hill for their safety.\n\nThe bear checked out the teen, who did not have any food on him, for a few seconds and then continued on down the hillside.\n\nLisa Kewsick via KOMO\n\n\"I couldn't even breathe. I was terrified,\" Bartley told KOMO. \"I didn\u2019t know what to do. It was the first time seeing huge wildlife. And I was just scared. Gut-wrenching, honestly.\"\n\nWashington Department of Fish and Wildlife Police captain Jeff Wickersham told KOMO the encounter was very unusual.\n\n\"When the bear walked up to the one hiker and got right at their feet, there\u2019s not much you can do at that range and that proximity,\" Wickersham said.\n\n\"I can't say I've ever seen a video of that happening in that type of location before,\" he said, adding that the family didn't do anything wrong.\n\nLisa Kewsick via KOMO\n\nHe advised other hikers if you encounter a bear to make yourself appear bigger than they are, get distance between yourself and the animal, carry bear spray and don't run.\n\n\"Sometimes animals will just start following you when you start running away,\" Wickersham added. \"And they didn\u2019t. They stood their ground. And I think that was probably a wise choice.\"\n\nBears typically look for food to prepare for winter during this time of year, Wickersham said.", "description": "A Seattle family heart-pounding encounter with a bear with hopes of getting all hikers to be more aware of.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/bear-encounter-ht-ps-191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
