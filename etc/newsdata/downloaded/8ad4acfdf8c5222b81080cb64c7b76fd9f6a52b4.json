And while serving time in the Bradshaw State Jail he wrote to a judge; 'I am praying\u2026 when I am discharged that I can put this whole series of events behind me and start off with a clean path.' His run-in with the law in Texas started in the state capital, Austin in April 2015. Court papers reviewed by DailyMail.com show that he was in the passenger seat of a parked Lexus. Both he and the driver were passed out. The car was in the lot of an America's Best Value Inn which arresting cop Eric Copeland described as 'a hotspot for criminal activity, including drugs, prostitution, stolen vehicles and fugitives.' 'I walked up to the vehicle and it appeared that both subjects were either asleep or unconscious,' Copeland wrote. 'Also, I immediately detected the strong and distinct odor of marijuana emitting from that vehicle. Centerville, Texas, where Joshua Brown was arrested, has a small population but boasts a store that calls itself \u2018The Jerky Capital of the World' When the car was searched, cops found cocaine, marijuana and the anti-anxiety drug alprazolam. Brown pleaded the case down from drug possession to attempted possession and his sentence was deferred for 18 months, court documents show. But he failed to pay his fines or turn up to meetings with his supervisor so a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was again found in a car, this time a Ford Mustang, parked in a fire lane outside an Exxon gas station in Centerville, midway between Dallas and Houston I September 2016. Leon County Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Nichols said he went up to the car and 'could smell the odor of marijuana coming from or about his person.' Nichols found a small baggie of cocaine on top of Brown's wallet, which Brown said he had 'found.' He also had an unlicensed Ruger .357 Magnum pistol in the car. The case was dealt with as a felony and Brown was sentenced to 180 days in jail on October 21, 2016. It was while he was in jail for that offense that he wrote two letters to the judge in Austin pledging to go clean and asking if his sentence there could run concurrently with the time he was already spending behind bars. Records also show that Brown was charged with marijuana possession and resisting arrest on Halloween 2017 in Denton County, north of Dallas.\n\nBrown's family issued a statement via their attorney Lee Merritt calling for the Dallas Police Department to turn over the investigation to an alternate agency.\n\n'This family and their representatives have consciously avoided speculating about law enforcement involvement in this tragedy, however, due to the proximity of this murder with the trial of Amber Guyger - rumors abound.\n\n'It will be nearly impossible to conduct a reliable investigation in a climate where the investigating agency has been implicated in the murder itself.\n\n'That implication naturally stems from a trial where a Dallas Police officer was convicted of murder and other DPD officers were shown to have participated in condemnable behavior in destroying evidence and interfering with the investigation.'\n\nMerritt had earlier said Brown was due to be one of the first witnesses to testify in an upcoming wrongful death lawsuit brought against the Dallas Police Department by Jean's family.\n\nJean's family is suing the city after claiming that police failed to properly train Guyger before she shot him dead in his own apartment.\n\nMerritt said he was reluctant to testify during Guyger's high-profile trial and had repeatedly expressed concerns for his safety.\n\nBrown had narrowly escaped death in November last year following a shooting outside a Dallas nightclub. He was shot in the foot and his 25-year-old friend was killed.\n\nMerritt has previously said Brown feared the people behind the shooting continued to mean him harm.\n\nHe said Brown fled Texas for California to avoid testifying at Guyger's trial.\n\nMerritt said Brown was in California on the first of Guyger's trial but that prosecutors allegedly threatened to issue a warrant for his arrest if he didn't show up the following day.\n\n'He got on a plane and came straight from the airport to the courthouse,' Merritt said. 'I believe he met with the judge in her chambers (on the record) and reiterated his concern about testifying.'\n\nSince news of Brown's murder broke, speculation has been rife about the timing of his death. Many have suggested the Dallas Police Department had a hand in Brown's murder\n\nBrown was shot in the parking lot of the Atera apartment complex (above) in Dallas's upscale Medical District at about 10.30pm on Friday\n\nSTATEMENT FROM JOSHUA BROWN'S FAMILY Brown's family issued a statement via their attorney Lee Merritt calling for the Dallas Police Department to turn over the investigation to an alternate agency: 'This family and their representatives have consciously avoided speculating about law enforcement involvement in this tragedy, however, due to the proximity of this murder with the trial of Amber Guyger - rumors abound. It will be nearly impossible to conduct a reliable investigation in a climate where the investigating agency has been implicated in the murder itself. 'That implication naturally stems from a trial where a Dallas Police officer was convicted of murder and other DPD officers were shown to have participated in condemnable behavior in destroying evidence and interfering with the investigation. It is important for everyone involved that this case not only be solved but the conclusions arrived to by investigators be seen as authentic and reliable. A cloud of suspicion will rest over this case until steps are take to ensure the trustworthiness of the process. The Brown family would like to extend their heartfelt gratitude to everyone around the country that has offered them support and encouragement during their time of bereavement.\n\nBrown took to the stand wearing a Dragon Ball Z t-shirt and shorts.\n\nHe went on to testify that he heard two gunshots and a commotion in the hallway the night Guyger shot dead Jean.\n\nBrown started crying when he was asked about the victim.\n\nHe said he had met Jean for the first time on the day he was killed when police knocked on both of their doors about a noise complaint, even though there wasn't anything loud going on in their apartments.\n\nBrown said he thought it might have been because both he and Jean smoked marijuana and the smell sometimes drifted into the hallway.\n\nMerritt pointed out that the court has mechanisms to limit the exposure of witnesses and more should have been done to protect Brown given his concerns.\n\n'(The court) took steps to cut off cameras and instruct media not to report on an undercover cop that testified in Guyger's trial,' Merritt said.\n\n'Why weren't the same measures taken to protect Joshua Brown? Brown's testimony was powerful but it was also duplicative. Nothing he testified to couldn't have been brought in by other witnesses.\n\n'It wasn't worth his life.'\n\nMerritt has previously called Brown's death an 'assassination'.\n\nHe has also refused to rule out that police were somehow involved in the shooting that took Brown's life.\n\n'I am not saying that law enforcement played a role in the murder of Joshua Brown. I am saying that the possibility of law enforcement involvement cannot be ruled out at this point,' he said.\n\n'Anyone who is murdered days after testifying in a murder trial naturally implicates the person or persons he testified against in the murder. There are no suspects and no leads currently in the murder of Joshua Brown. That means investigators are responsible for turning over every stone.\n\n'Moreover, the people responsible for investigating this case can not be the same people implicated by the proximity to the trial. In other words, Dallas PD should not be investigating this murder. The case should be turned over to an outside agency like the sheriff's department, FBI or DOJ.'", "description": "The Dallas Police Department said late Tuesday night that 32-year-old Michael Mitchell, inset, was arrested in Marksville, Louisiana in connection with the death of Brown, main.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen", "Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com", "Martin Gould In Centerville", "Texas For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/05/19474352-0-image-a-42_1570594597703.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
