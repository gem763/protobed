If we have to as a matter of last resort in order to protect the integrity of the system, we aim to do so at minimal levels, in the shortest duration possible,\u201d he said.\n\nMabuza also apologised to the nation, especially matriculants who are writing exams and businesses, for the negative impact caused by the unexpected outages.\n\nDebilitating power cuts in February and March pushed first-quarter economic growth into contraction and raised the likelihood of South Africa losing an investment-grade rating.\n\nMoody\u2019s is the last of the big three credit rating agencies to have an investment grade rating on South Africa and is due to deliver its latest credit review on November 1.\n\nEnergy plan\n\nThe power cuts also affected supplies to Zimbabwe, where Eskom exports up to 400 megawatts daily, the country\u2019s electricity utility ZESA Holdings said in a notice on Thursday.\n\nPower cuts are a daily occurrence in Zimbabwe but Eskom\u2019s supply problems were compounding the situation.\n\nEskom produces more than 90% of South Africa's electricity but has been hobbled by technical faults at its fleet of mainly coal-fired power stations.\n\nIt is also grappling with a debt pile which stood at around R440 billion rand as of March.\n\nRamaphosa has pledged R59 billion of support for Eskom over the next two years, on top of R230 billion in bailouts spread over the next 10 years.\n\nOfficials say its operational losses mean Eskom will also have to take other measures to make it financially sustainable.\n\nNatasha Mazzone, the DA\u2019s shadow minister of public enterprises, said the government\u2019s \u201cmismanagement\u201d of Eskom was to blame for the power cuts.\n\nCabinet on Thursday approved the promulgation of the long-delayed plan for electricity generation until 2030.\n\nThe Integrated Resource Plan will replace a previous blueprint not updated for almost a decade, and deals with planned electricity generation and energy mix.\n\n\u201cThe plan proposes nine interventions to ensure the country responds to the energy needs for the next decade,\u201d said Cabinet without elaborating.\n\nThe interventions consider energy demand and supply as well as international obligations for South Africa to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions, Cabinet added. The government will disclose more details at a media briefing on Friday.\n\n- Additional reporting by News24", "description": "South Africa will experience power cuts for a third day on Friday but is unlikely to be affected through the weekend as more generating units return to service, Eskom acting chief executive Jabu Mabuza said.", "authors": ["Nqobile Dludla", "Wendell Roelf"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7632/406417c57df645369a09b1bdf2e2dccb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
