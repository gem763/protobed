The heads of the studios wanted to create a film that would appeal equally to American and Chinese audiences, enabling them to capture the two largest movie markets.\n\nAD\n\nBut perhaps the Chinese side went too far in appealing to nationalist tendencies in Beijing.\n\nIn one scene, Yi repeatedly walks past a map on a wall, which contains the unmistakable dotted U-shape of the nine-dash line, encompassing a swath of the South China Sea that Beijing claims as its own. Other countries \u2014 including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam \u2014 claim rights to the resource-rich sea.\n\nAD\n\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled against China in 2016, declaring that Beijing\u2019s assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea has no legal or historical basis.\n\nBeijing rejected the decision and has continued to patrol and build islands in the sea to extend its de facto control over the waterway\n\nTensions have grown in recent months as a Chinese survey ship with a coast guard escort has sailed through an area controlled by Vietnam. Vietnam has licensed Russian energy giant Rosneft to explore for oil in the area, prompting protests from China.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nSo moviegoers in Vietnam, where the film is called \u201cEverest: Tiny Snowman,\u201d were outraged to see the dotted line on the map over the weekend. Some shared it on social media, and that prompted officials to take action against the film, which opened in Vietnam on Oct. 4.\n\n\u201cWe will revoke [the film\u2019s license],\u201d Deputy Culture Minister Ta Quang Dong told the Thanh Nien newspaper, according to Reuters.\n\nAnother official, cinema department director Thu Ha, confirmed the action. \u201cWe will be more alert and cautious in future,\u201d Vietnam Insider quoted her as saying.\n\nAD\n\nVietnam\u2019s main movie-theater chain, South Korean-owned CGV, stopped selling tickets to the film, said representative Hoang Hai. All information and trailers have been removed from its website and YouTube channel.\n\nDreamWorks could not be reached for comment, and Pearl Studio did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nIt was not the dotted line\u2019s first appearance this month on screens outside China.\n\nESPN, the U.S. sports channel, was sharply criticized for using a map showing the line \u2014 although it had 10 dashes \u2014 when reporting on the furor over a tweet by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team. That stemmed from a different territorial sore point: the protests in Hong Kong over Beijing\u2019s increasingly heavy-handed governance of the supposedly semiautonomous territory.\n\nAD\n\nThe nine-dash line is seldom, if ever, used by anyone outside China, and ESPN was accused of going too far to try to appease Beijing.\n\nStill, the appearance of the nine-dash line \u2014 or the friendly themes of \u201cAbominable\u201d \u2014 have found a generally approving audience in China. Box-office sales have exceeded $14 million, according to Maoyan, China\u2019s largest online movie-ticketing service provider.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBenefiting from the magnificent Chinese scenery and heartwarming Chinese emotions, the movie has broken through cultural differences as the first animated film produced by China and distributed globally,\u201d Maoyan said. \u201cIt can be regarded as a new paragon of cultural exports.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe film has scored 7.5 out of 10 on the Douban review site, China\u2019s equivalent of Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\u201cA good animation. Classic Hollywood story line with strong Chinese characteristics,\u201d wrote a reviewer using the screen name Sikaodemao. \u201cDisplaying the scenery of the beautiful motherland makes it like a tribute film to the country. But it is highly entertaining and all the kids were laughing.\u201d\n\nAnother commenter, Tang Xiaowan, was less impressed. \u201cChinese skin, American core,\u201d Tang wrote.\n\nChina is a cutthroat market for Hollywood studios. According to Chinese rules, only 38 foreign films are allowed to be shown in Chinese movie theaters each year, fueling competition among studios to make films that will win Chinese authorities\u2019 approval.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere have been several examples of movie producers altering scripts to please Beijing.\n\nWhen \u201cRed Dawn\u201d was rereleased seven years ago, the villains, who were meant to be Chinese, suddenly became North Korean. In the disaster movie \u201c2012,\u201d Hollywood added references to Chinese scientists rescuing civilization.\n\n\n\nYin Hong, professor of film and television studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said political and economic elements needed to be considered when making co-productions.\n\n\u201cOf course China is actively propelling its movies toward world viewers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not always easy to get what they want.\u201d\n\nWang Yuan contributed to this report.", "description": "The country pulled the film from theaters after the DreamWorks-Pearl Studio co-production showed a map endorsing the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s stance in the maritime dispute.", "authors": ["Anna Fifield", "Beijing Bureau Chief."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9ZOICpc_XQGlULel-3Mk0BPcjP0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BHP5XYHOQAI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
