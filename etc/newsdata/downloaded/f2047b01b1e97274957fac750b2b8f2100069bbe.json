Mitt Romney (R-Utah) had a secret lurker account on Twitter \u2015 one with a very memorable fake name.\n\nUsing clues from an Atlantic magazine profile, Slate found that Romney\u2019s lurker account was hiding under @qaws9876, but bearing the handle: Pierre Delecto. Pierre is a French name, equivalent to Peter in English. Delecto is Latin for \u201cdelight\u201d or \u201ccharm,\u201d according to the Online Latin Dictionary.\n\nRomney confirmed the news \u2015 in French \u2015 when asked in a follow-up by the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cC\u2019est moi,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nDON EMMERT via Getty Images Just call me Mitt... or Pierre Delecto.\n\nThe Twitter account has since been made private.\n\nWhile the account was created in 2011, it had very little activity on it other than defending Romney from media figures, such as when Soledad O\u2019Brien slammed him for an \u201cutter lack of a moral compass.\u201d Romney \u2015 or rather, \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d \u2015 fired back that he was the only GOP senator to call out Trump on the Mueller report and \u201chit Trump on character time and again,\u201d per screenshots taken by Slate.\n\nThe account did have some very interesting \u201clikes,\u201d including a tweet earlier this month suggesting the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office:\n\nI've always thought that \"invoke the 25th amendment!\" was a misguided, futile notion but after this Tweet from the President, I'm reassessing... https://t.co/MFs3MpT6kj \u2014 Jeff Greenfield (@greenfield64) October 7, 2019\n\nRomney has at least two active official accounts, a personal one as well as one for his Senate office, along with some others, such as the TeamRomney account set up for his 2012 presidential campaign, which hasn\u2019t tweeted since an election night message that boasted about winning Indiana.\n\nThe secret Twitter account revelation gave Romney more attention on Twitter than perhaps he\u2019s ever had. Just not under his own name. \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d trended big time on Sunday evening:\n\nPierre Delecto is 100% the name I would imagine Mitt Romney picking for his alt-account. https://t.co/DtcThdDbGx \u2014 The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) October 20, 2019\n\nPierre Delecto just called for the impeachment of David Dennison. \u2014 Mrs. Betty Bowers (@BettyBowers) October 21, 2019\n\nSeems Pierre Delecto has been a member of our Resistance for some time.
