There\u2019s a great case study right here in the bluest of blue states: New York.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo hailed the 2013 New York SAFE Act as the toughest gun control law in the nation, and one of its most important provisions was the mandatory registration of all \u201cassault weapons\u201d in the state. This isn\u2019t a confiscation or even a ban, so it\u2019s nowhere near as severe as what O\u2019Rourke and others are pushing\u2014it\u2019s just a teeny weeny little registration requirement.\n\nSo how has that worked out? Well, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation\u2019s conservative estimate, New Yorkers owned about 1 million \u201cassault weapons\u201d at the time the ban was passed. So the 44,000 that were actually registered are about 4 percent of the total. This noncompliance with the law is widespread and mostly open, but the police aren\u2019t doing much about it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jon Stokes", "Reason.Com The-Futility-Of-A-Gun-Buyback"], "top_image": ""}
