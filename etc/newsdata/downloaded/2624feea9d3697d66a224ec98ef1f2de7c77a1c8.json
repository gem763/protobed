Those sanctions targeted Iran's central bank, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said was the nation's last source of funds.\n\n\u201cThis is very big,\u201d Mnuchin said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve now cut off all source of funds to Iran.\u201d\n\nAlthough Yemen's Houthi rebels initially claimed responsibility for the attack -- which resulted temporarily in a loss of roughly 6 percent of the world's oil output -- the U.S. and its European allies suspect Iran was behind the attack.\n\nIran denies the accusations.\n\nPompeo also said the U.S. will take steps to disentangle the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from the Iranian economy by educating countries about the risk of doing business with IRGC entities.\n\n\"We will punish them if they persist in defiance of our warnings,\" he said.\n\nPompeo's announcement came one day after Trump's speech before the UN General Assembly, during which he condemned Iranian leaders' \"bloodlust\" in a scathing speech.\n\n\u201cAll nations have a duty to act. No responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust. As long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted, they will be tightened,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIran has refused to negotiate with the U.S. unless it returns to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Trump abandoned last year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n", "description": "It's the latest attempt from Washington to ratchet up pressure on Iran.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6_yvuucrraPKyhe5AYP.ww--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/c3fe0d40-b518-11e9-bfdf-8cd34d5d7524", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
