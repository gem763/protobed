The new debate on the early poll is expected next Monday.\n\nJohnson attempted on two recent occasions to call an election but failed each time to get the motion passed and will need to win the backing of two-thirds of MPs to get the latest election push through Parliament. The prime minister added that, if MPs agree to an election on December 12, Parliament would be dissolved on November 6.\n\nOpposition parties have so far refused to agree to an election until the government can remove the threat of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe way to get Brexit done is to, I think, be reasonable with Parliament,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf they genuinely want more time to study this excellent deal, they can have it but they have to agree to a general election on December 12 \u2013 that\u2019s the way forward.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com BoJo eager for general election to secure Brexit, but how can he get one?\n\nJohnson also said Parliament would have enough time to study the Brexit Bill before dissolving for an election, adding that it would be morally incredible for Labour to refuse an election at this point.\n\nThe government has floundered in its efforts to get a Brexit deal through Parliament. Its latest bid was dealt a serious blow on Saturday when MPs voted to delay deciding on the newest version of the deal.\n\nThe Speaker of the House then refused to grant a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the bill on Monday, saying that allowing it to proceed would essentially amount to debating the same matter twice.\n\nThe decision by MPs to delay their vote scuppered the chances of getting the necessary legislation through both Houses by the end-of-October deadline, forcing Number 10 to write to the EU asking for another delay, despite Johnson\u2019s vocal opposition to making such a request.\n\nI have written to Jeremy Corbyn: this Parliament must get Brexit done now or a NEW Parliament must get Brexit done so the country can move on pic.twitter.com/PekfFRsR9F \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 24, 2019\n\nIn a letter to opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn on Thursday, the prime minister said it\u2019s likely the EU will offer a new Brexit delay up to the end of January 2020, but that it could offer a shorter one, to November 15 or 30.\n\nOn the bright side for Johnson, he has managed to break his string of parliamentary defeats, winning the Queen\u2019s Speech vote. The monarch's speech, which is basically the government\u2019s legislative program for the next parliamentary session, was passed on Thursday by the lawmakers, by a narrow margin of 16 votes.\n\nAlso on rt.com BoJo wins Queen\u2019s Speech vote, as all eyes now focus on Brussels\u2019 next move on Brexit\n\nOn top of that, the new debate on whether to hold early parliamentary elections has been greenlighted to take place next Monday.\n\n\u201cMembers will have an opportunity to debate and approve a motion relating to an early parliamentary election,\u201d the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg told parliament.\n\nLike this story?
