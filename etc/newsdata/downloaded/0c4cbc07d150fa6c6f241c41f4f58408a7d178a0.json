Were it not for Trump\u2019s trade tactics, the Fed probably would not have eased at all. More so, financial market expectations for easing in 2020 will have to be rapidly wound back if prospects of a trade deal improve.\n\nIt would represent an incredible backflip if it happens.\n\nYarra Capital's Tim Toohey thinks the market has misread both the US economy and the Fed's intentions. Eamon Gallagher\n\nPreviously, Toohey was the chief economist of JBWere, going on to become the chief economist of Goldman Sachs in Australia. Yarra Capital was founded by the former Goldman Sachs Asset Management equities team.\n\n\"In many ways it\u2019s about me reconnecting with people I\u2019ve known for a very long period of time,\" he says of his appointment. He's intrigued by the ability to deploy macro expertise across the whole capital structure.\n\nWith this year's bond market performance in mind, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that unchartered,\" he says of what's become a common refrain. \"What was unchartered was when the financial crisis hit and we weren\u2019t sure whether the financial system would survive at all, but if you look even at the rotation over the last couple of weeks, I think there are data points that are really interesting that [suggest] the market got way too bearish.\"\n\nIt may well be a different world in terms of how policy formation will continue to evolve, but that doesn't mean the \"nitty gritty\" of the data can be ignored, such as the Baltic dry index and South Korean semiconductor exports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToohey prides himself on trying to get the cycle right and seeing the turning points when they happen. \"I don\u2019t think you add a whole lot of value if you get the RBA right this month versus next month.\"\n\nBesides working with a lot of smart people over many years, and hoping some of that has rubbed off, he is fanatical about process.\n\n\"I always build my own indicators up from scratch, I like to understand exactly what goes into them and econometrically solve my way. You have to have your touchstones and then you need a few channel checks. You can\u2019t wake up one morning and decide it\u2019s a whole new universe.\"\n\nRates markets and foreign exchange markets rarely look to the equity market as a strong signal, he says. \"I just think it's such a rich data source, you learn some of the best stuff talking to small companies.\"\n\nToohey thinks the shift to forward guidance at the Reserve Bank of Australia is interesting.\n\n\"I think [the Reserve Bank is] obviously indicating they\u2019re prepared to keep rates low for a long period of time, they\u2019ve opened the window to another cut, and it's more about provision of credit, house prices and particularly wages. They\u2019ve shifted the goalposts a little bit there and they\u2019re using forward guidance now.\"\n\nIf the Reserve Bank does undertake quantitative easing, \"it's definitely going to be bespoke,\" Toohey says. \"Let's be frank, we can point to a number of their speeches where they\u2019ve talked about QE globally and why it hasn\u2019t worked as well.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA central banker he holds in high regard is the Bank of Canada's Stephen Poloz.\n\n\"He reminds me a lot of Glenn Stevens,\" he says. \"He communicates very well, he engenders a good team beneath him, I think he\u2019s the benchmark really. He\u2019s coming to the end of his tenure and it's interesting what happens next.\"\n\nThis is also instructive given the similarities between Australia and Canada's banking system, resources narrative and conversations about China investment.\n\nIt's important, he agrees, for monetary policymakers to push themselves to hear from the market. \"If you\u2019re sitting there waiting for a certain checklist to be hit, and not putting out your tentacles far and wide, and not listening to what the market's telling you there can be missteps.\"\n\nWho can forget the taper tantrum of 2013 triggered by Ben Bernanke, for example. The disruption was \"phenomenal\", Toohey recalls, and it was deeply felt even in Australian assets.\n\n\"It was really just the Fed doing a survey amongst its money market dealers and not realising the survey was not representative of the broader market.\"\n\nThe Fed suffered another \"own goal\" last week in its inability to anticipate liquidity needs in the short-term money market, causing a spike in rates. \"The recent squeeze was unusual in that it occurred mid-month and it seems the Fed misjudged the financial markets' required liquidity needs into some well-flagged events \u2013 quarterly tax payments by corporates being filed simultaneously with a surge in new Treasury issuance,\" he explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Powell portrayed this as unimportant in his press conference last week, this is only true from a systemic point of view, Toohey argues. \"It would be better optics for the Fed to at least get right the basics of day-to-day demand and supply of funding markets. It seems the lesson is: put enough pressure on any institution and cracks will appear.\"\n\nGoing into last week's Fed meeting, financial markets had confidently priced two more Fed cuts. \"If we get this partial resolution on trade, if the data continues to do what I think it's going to do, you could see that second cut progressively ease out.\"\n\nIt's no secret that US policymakers at the political level have a big incentive to resolve trade conflicts before the 2020 presidential race, which should be good for equities and credit markets.\n\nFinally, Toohey agrees that the reappraisal of the neutral rate is one of the most profound developments for this generation of monetary thinking.\n\n\"I think a lot of old-time economists who spent all their time thinking about NAIRU [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment] and where the neutral rate all fits together couldn\u2019t have imagined that empirically it moved down as much as what it did do. How much of that is a productivity story? How much is it demographic?\"\n\nDemographics are certainly a big part of it, he thinks. And the data is not good at capturing productivity being unlocked, meaning it is under-reported in important sectors such as financial services and health care. In the health system, for example, the difference between an outpatient and an overnight hospital stay is not adequately adjusted for in productivity terms.", "description": "Market expectations for easing will have to be wound back if prospects of a trade deal improve, says Yarra Capital's Tim Toohey.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6814%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2137%2C$y_957/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ad5a384f7a723529be65a6c2966941882b99fa34", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
