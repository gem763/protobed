[Photo/Agencies]\n\nThe European Union's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a Brexit deal is \"still possible\" this week despite it becoming more difficult to reach an agreement between Brussels and London.\n\nBarnier gave an update on Brexit talks before a meeting with the EU's member states at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Our team is working hard,\" said Barnier. \"This work has been intense all over the weekend and yesterday. Because, even if an agreement will be difficult\uff0dmore and more difficult, to be frank\uff0dit is still possible this week.\"\n\nBarnier added that the main challenge now is to turn British proposals on the complex issue of the border on the island of Ireland into something binding, saying it is \"high time to turn good intentions into a legal text\".\n\nHe said: \"Reaching an agreement is still possible. Obviously any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the United Kingdom and the whole of the European Union.\"\n\nBritain's Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, who was due to meet with Barnier later in the day, said ongoing talks need \"space to proceed\" but added \"detailed conversations are under way and a deal is still very possible\".\n\nThe comments give a glimmer of hope after Finland's leader Antti Rinne on Monday said there was \"no time\" for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to achieve an agreement.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Newsnight, UK Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick rejected the remarks, stressing a \"great deal\" of progress had been made and negotiators are working \"very intensively\".\n\n\"The EU is capable of moving extremely quickly if they wish to,\" Jenrick said.\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the British proposals to keep the Irish border protected from smuggling and fraud once the UK leaves the bloc remain insufficient and are \"not enough to guarantee that the internal market will be protected\".\n\nEU leaders are meeting for a two-day summit in Brussels from Thursday, which is seen as the last chance to agree any deal before the Oct 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nThe British people voted to leave the EU on June 23, 2016, and the country was due to leave on March 29 this year following two years of negotiations.\n\nFormer British prime minister Theresa May tried\uff0dand failed\uff0dthree times to get the deal she agreed with Brussels passed by MPs. Her failure prompted her resignation and Brexit being pushed back to Oct 31.\n\nJohnson replaced her and insists Britain will leave on that date \"do or die\". But the British Parliament passed a law saying the country cannot leave without an agreement, and Johnson has not explained how he can get around that.", "description": "The European Union's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a Brexit deal is \"still possible\" this week despite it becoming more difficult to reach an agreement between Brussels and London.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/16/5da6756ca310cf3e97a168f5.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
