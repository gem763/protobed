Phil Libin, the company's CEO and founder, has shifted the focus of the incubator from fostering artificial intelligence applications and products to developing apps that improve people's health.\n\n\"We were always focused on solving what we thought were worthwhile problems, and the more we started looking at things, the more we realized that there's this common thread running through a lot of the problems in the world,\" he said. \"The way that we live is maladapted,\" he continued. \"It's not how we evolved to live.\"\n\nAll Turtles isn't abandoning artificial intelligence, by any means. One of the first applications to come out of its studio \u2014 Spot \u2014 is an AI-based chatbot that designed to make it easier for those who have experienced workplace harassment or discrimination to report what happened to them.\n\nRead this: How an academic specialist in human memory created a chat app that's helping companies fight harassment and discrimination\n\nSimilarly, it's backed and is working with a startup called Tellus that's developing a device that's designed to monitor the vital signs and activities of elderly people using precision radar. Tellus' service relies on AI to make sense of the data coming from its radar-based sensor and to highlight notable changes.\n\nAll Turtles ditched a planned AI editor for its Sift app\n\nAll Turtles originally planned to use artificial intelligence as an editor for its Sift news app, then abandoned the idea, deciding that it wasn't needed. Screenshot/Troy Wolverton But Libin is also open to having All Turtles work on projects that don't include any kind of AI at all. Last fall, for example, the company launched Sift, an app designed to provide users a deeper understanding of issues in the news without making them feel stressed or overwhelmed. The app covers topics including immigration, gun rights, and healthcare and offers a nonpartisan perspective with historical background and data to help explain the policy debate over such issues.\n\nOriginally, All Turtle planned to use AI to serve as a kind of editor for Sift. It would determine which topics were the most contentious, do some initial research on them, and even assign reporters to follow up and put together modules about them. But Libin and his team quickly realized that the AI was unnecessary.\n\n\"Humans are perfectly capable of knowing what people are yelling at each other about,\" he said. \"It just felt better as a hand-crafted thing.\"\n\nLibin insists the thesis he had when he launched All Turtles hasn't really changed. That assumption was that there are real problems in the world that haven't been solvable in the past that can now be solved because something is fundamentally different. Previously, his assumption was that the thing that was fundamentally different was going to be artificial intelligence or technology more broadly.\n\nHe still thinks that's going to be true most of the time. But he's open to the idea that some problems may now be solvable for reasons other than technology.\n\n\"Our goal is not to shove AI into things. Our goal is to make make products that make people healthier,\" he said. \"I think a lot of them will benefit significantly from AI, but if they don't, they don't.\"\n\nChanges other than just technological ones offer opportunities\n\nSift, for instance, is trying to address the problem of people feeling anxious and outraged and stressed out by the news. What's changed \u2014 what's created an opportunity for Sift \u2014is the concern being raised by people such as former Google engineer Tristan Harris about how Internet services are stoking that outrage and how harmful that constant agitation can be to a democratic society that depends on informed citizens who can engage in reasoned, rational discussion, Libin said.\n\nSimilarly, while Spot depends on AI, it's also benefitted from the spotlight that's been placed on sexual harassment in the workplace by the MeToo movement and the massive employee walkout at Google last year.\n\n\"If you were doing something to combat workplace harassment and discrimination a few years ago, I think most companies would have said, 'We don't have that problem.' Now no one says that,\" Libin said.\n\n\"So, it's a combination of the technology getting better, but also the problem becoming much more obvious and acknowledged.\"\n\nEven if All Turtles focus has shifted a bit, it's strategy hasn't. Libin is building out a global incubator; the company already has offices in Paris and Tokyo. It plans to open an office in Mexico City and other places around the world, although it's pushed back further expansion from this year until next.\n\nLibin still believes in All Turtles' model\n\nLibin also still believes in and is building All Turtles around another part of his thesis \u2014 that the way that technology and innovation is being fostered is fundamentally broken. Instead of focusing exclusively on using startups as the sole vehicles to develop technologies, All Turtles has taken a more eclectic approach.\n\nIn some cases it does back startups or develops technologies that will be spun off as separate companies. In other cases, it partners with existing companies to work on new products together. In still other cases, it develops technologies in-house that it plans to keep and offer as its own products.\n\n\"This idea that you can only innovate in startups is just a dumb idea,\" Libin said.\n\nHis only frustration with that thesis and All Turtles' model is that he keeps having to explain them to potential funders.\n\n\"Anytime you're explaining the model, you're not talking about the right thing,\" Libin said. \"I am anxious to be at the point,\" he continued, \"where no one cares about that anymore.\"\n\nGot a tip about venture capital or startups?
