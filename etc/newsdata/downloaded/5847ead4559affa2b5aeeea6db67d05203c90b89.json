We know the right gilet is a one-stop, instant glamour hack, and seriously versatile, too. Gilets make everything easier.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re going to dinner at the Whatsits and you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re making a point of not putting on the heating until December, just throw a gilet over your flimsy dress.\n\nOr, if you\u2019re going to a dressed-up party, but you\u2019re feeling self-consciously smart and a bit stiff, add a gilet.\n\nShane Watson recommends keeping a gilet on standby as the item of clothing is an instant glamour hack and also versatile. Pictured: Boden's faux fur one\n\nIf you want to make an ordinary silk shirt and trousers instantly more 1970s Studio 54 or Bourgeois Chic (both very much looks of the moment), or give a plain midi skirt and matching top some star quality, add a gilet.\n\nJeans and a polo neck too casual? You know what will bump it up into the dressy casual zone.\n\nMore relaxed than a jacket, more substantial than a waistcoat, and somewhere on the fashion scale between uptown girl and Glastonbury hippy \u2014 depending on how you wear it \u2014 the usefulness of a gilet is not to be underestimated.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear what we\u2019re talking about here, because there are bodywarmers and quilted gilets and any number of utilitarian gilets out there \u2014 best are the Uniqlo ultra light down vests (from \u00a329.90, uniqlo.com), and the quilted Asos ones (from \u00a322, asos.com).\n\nBut we\u2019re not talking about the purely practical gilet here. By my reckoning, what distinguishes a fashion gilet from the crowd is glamour: it\u2019s not just warm, it adds something to your look \u2014 texture and swagger and filmstar cool \u2014 and it\u2019s probably sheepskin.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be sheepskin, of course, and we\u2019ll come on to the alternatives, but inevitably the luxiest-looking gilets are the real thing.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that sheepskin, or shearling (the smoother, less shaggy of the two), is a by-product and more environmentally friendly than fake fur (no microfibres).\n\nIf you do own a sheepskin gilet, you will own it for life, so that\u2019s something to bear in mind \u2014 because they\u2019re not cheap. Whistles does a good steel grey or black Toscana one (\u00a3450, whistles.com).\n\nModel Yasmin Le Bon (pictured) looks glamorous in a black gilet layered on top of a colourful dress\n\nIf you prefer having suede outside and a sheepskin lining (collar and trim on show), then Leather Company does a decent one (\u00a3299, leather company.co.uk), as does Brora (\u00a3295, brora.co.uk).\n\nMeanwhile, at the top of the desirable list is Me+Em\u2019s hooded shearling gilet (\u00a3699, meandem.com).\n\nThe hood does mean you won\u2019t be wearing it over your long Lurex dress, but what you lose on cocktail wear you gain on everyday smartening.\n\nSoft, shar pei-fold shearling hoods look great layered under a narrow-cut coat or jacket.\n\nGilets: The new rules Treat a gilet like a biker jacket while the weather permits it. When it gets colder, layer a coat on top\n\nSheepskin can work like a feather boa or a fur chubby coat at night\n\nYour gilet should be hip-covering but not heavy\n\nBlack sheepskin is best\n\nThis gilet has a curved rear hem, so it\u2019s short at the front and almost bottom-covering at the back \u2014 the best of both worlds.\n\nAnd length is critical. Gilets provide rear camouflage, if you want it, but a too-long gilet weighs you down (avoid the long midi ones \u2014 you\u2019ll look like Cruella De Vil). But a short gilet will look wrong unless you\u2019re wearing it over a midi dress.\n\nThe White Company does a reversible sheepskin one (\u00a3315, thewhitecompany.com) that\u2019s a good length: hip-covering but not bottom-covering.\n\nThe only other important issue with gilets is colour. You can\u2019t go wrong with black sheepskin, but when it comes to shearling I\u2019d take a chance on taupe, or even cream \u2014 softer, more original, better in the day. When it\u2019s fake fur, a rich dark colour is best.\n\nOf the faux shearlings, French Connection does one that\u2019s faux fur inside and faux leather outside (\u00a395, french connection.com); it is black, but it has good substitute biker jacket potential.\n\nZara does a shaggy, faux \u2018fuzzy\u2019 sheepskin version, also black (\u00a359.99, zara.com). And Boden has a cream faux fur one (\u00a366, boden.co.uk, above left).
