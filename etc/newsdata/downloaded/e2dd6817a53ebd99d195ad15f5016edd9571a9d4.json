Now the trailer for the audiobook is confirming it.\n\nMansbach is the author behind blunt parenting favorites \u201cGo the F**k to Sleep\u201d and \u201cYou Have to F**king Eat.\u201d The third installment in his series of \u201cchildren\u2019s books for adults\u201d is \u201cF**k, Now There Are Two of You\u201d \u2015 an honest look at the reality of welcoming a second child.\n\nAudiobook publisher Dreamscape Media shared a hilarious trailer previewing David\u2019s narration, which is a monologue from a potty-mouthed parent to a firstborn child about the new addition to the family. Given the comedian\u2019s reputation as someone who isn\u2019t overly sentimental about parenthood, it\u2019s a match made in heaven.\n\nDreamscape Media Both the print version and audiobook of \u201cF**k, Now There Are Two of You\u201d will be available on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that Larry David was going to voice this book, I jumped up and down with joy \u2015 which was awkward, because I was getting a vasectomy at the time,\u201d Mansbach stated in a press release. \u201cDavid\u2019s a f**king national treasure, and he did just as fantastic a job as you\u2019d expect. I can\u2019t wait for you to hear it.\u201d\n\nPrevious Mansbach series narrators include Samuel L. Jackson, who lent his talents to the audiobook for \u201cGo The F**k to Sleep,\u201d and Bryan Cranston, who tackled \u201cYou Have to F**king Eat.\u201d Over the years, celebrities like Jennifer Garner and LeVar Burton have also narrated their own versions of \u201cGo The F**k To Sleep.\u201d", "description": "''F**k, Now There Are Two of You\" is Adam Mansbach's latest expletive-filled bedtime story.", "authors": ["Culture", "Amp", "Parenting Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8263e52400002e2a7db4ca.png?cache=nAAijweuAj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
