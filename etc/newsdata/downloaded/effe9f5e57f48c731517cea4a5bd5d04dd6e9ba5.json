A number of these are hard for Russia to accept, but that doesn\u2019t mean the peace process is doomed.\n\nUnlike in the last three years or so, both sides actually want to end the conflict, and share the goal of having the Kyiv government re-establish sovereignty over the regions in eastern Ukraine now held by pro-Moscow separatists. The question that any further talks must settle is to what extent Russia will be able to maintain its influence in the area, known as the Donbas. That\u2019s a gray area in which reality is likely to defy any formal red lines.\n\nZelenskiy, predictably, got into trouble at home after Ukraine accepted a key Russian demand \u2014 that it approve the so-called Steinmeier formula, proposed by German President Frank Walter-Steinmeier in 2016, when he was his nation\u2019s foreign minister. The formula says the separatist-held areas should get a special autonomous status under Ukrainian law immediately after the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe recognizes the outcome of a local election.\n\nThese sequence\u2019s opponents include Zelenskiy\u2019s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, and the well-armed veterans of the east Ukraine war. They say an election is only possible after Russia restores to Ukraine the control of its eastern border. For the Kremlin, this condition means Ukrainians may try to arrest its supporters in eastern Ukraine before the election \u2014 and before they\u2019re subject to an amnesty stipulated in Ukraine\u2019s law on the east\u2019s special status.\n\nZelenskiy could have ignored protests in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Though his popular support is dropping \u2014 a recent poll shows it at 66%, down from 73% in September \u2014 his desire for peace in the east remains overwhelmingly popular. But Ukraine is a country at war, and veterans are a powerful force. Some of them proved that by effectively scuppering an agreed pullback of both Russian and separatist troops near the village of Zolote. Led by a nationalist former legislator, they have inserted themselves between the Ukrainian and separatist troops, saying they were there to prevent a Russian takeover of the territory that regular Ukrainian forces had been ordered to leave. Zelenskiy refused to remove them by force, saying persuasion was the better approach. The official reason Ukraine has halted its troop withdrawal is that the separatists haven\u2019t ceased fire.\n\nVladislav Surkov, the Kremlin official in charge of eastern Ukraine, has called the mutual pullback at Zolote a precondition for restarting talks with Ukraine in the so-called Normandy format \u2014 mediated by Germany and France. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his aides doubt that Zelenskiy can stand up to the domestic opposition to the degree necessary for progress. But Zelenskiy is working to make the pullback happen, and eventually it will.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelenskiy and his foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, are trying to reassure both Ukrainians and allies in Europe that they\u2019re not about to hand Putin a veto on Ukraine's future direction by letting him control the east. During a marathon 14-hour news conference last week, Zelenskiy told reporters that his team had \u201cundercommunicated\u201d its position. He has since used every opportunity, including a speech to the military in the east, to insist that no elections will be held in the crosshairs of Russian guns. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m already getting an allergy to the word \u2018capitulation,\u2019 \u201d he told service members.\n\nAt the same time, Prystaiko has traveled to Luxembourg and Brussels to communicate a similar message. He has named three distinct Ukrainian red lines: Eastern territories\u2019 autonomy shouldn\u2019t turn Ukraine, now a unitary state, into a federation; Ukraine won\u2019t change its constitution to incorporate expanded rights for these territories; elections will be held only after all Russian troops are withdrawn, pro-Russian military units disbanded and control of the border handed back to Ukraine.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Under constant pressure from protesters who fear a \u201csurrender\u201d to Russia, the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is laying out what it calls its red lines in peace talks on eastern Ukraine.
