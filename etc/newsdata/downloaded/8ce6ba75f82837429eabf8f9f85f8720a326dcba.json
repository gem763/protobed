Now Capital can reveal she is actually publishing one next May.\n\nArcuri\u2019s book, Hands on Hacking, is about how ethical hacking can provide the solution to cyberattacks and is co-wrote by Matthew Hickey, her husband, and cybersecurity expert James McAlonan.\n\n\u201cHands on Hacking has categorically nothing to do with Boris Johnson,\u201d Arcuri confirms to Capital via email. \u201cThis book is written from the genius technical ability that my husband, @HackerFantastic, has and has built into our hacker house training portal.\u201d The tome is being published by academic publisher Wiley.\n\nJohnson himself is the author of half a dozen best-selling books on subjects ranging from Winston Churchill to the Roman Empire but hasn\u2019t written a book about hacking. It could be an idea for him to pursue after he leaves Number 10. A Downing Street spokesman declined to comment on the book.\n\nDier learning\n\nTottenham Hotspur and England midfielder Eric Dier has started just one Premier League game so far this season for the north London football club. But this gives Dier more time to study.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing an Open University course in social science and I\u2019m writing an essay at the moment about the 2011 London riots... I\u2019m at the end of my first year,\u201d Dier says in an interview with David Lammy MP for Amy Raphael\u2019s new book A Game of Two Halves.\n\nDier adds the title of the essay is: \u201cIf the radical perspective on riots is poverty, unemployment and inequality, what is the conservative perspective?\u201d\n\nDier had not yet joined the club at the time of the 2011 riots, which started in Tottenham. Dier isn\u2019t the first high-profile footballer to embrace uni on the side. Former Arsenal star Dennis Bergkamp studied mechanical engineering off-season.\n\nGreed is good\n\nAny lingering doubts that Michael Winterbottom\u2019s new film Greed, starring Steve Coogan and David Mitchell, wasn\u2019t inspired by the turmoil suffered by Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group were dispelled at the movie\u2019s London Film Festival premiere last week. Asked who the character of Sir Richard \u201cGreedy\u201d McCreadie is based on, Coogan said: \u201cThe short answer is Philip Green.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some ways Philip Green is really someone who is the perfect expression of the market being able to do what it does,\u201d Coogan added.\n\nWriter-director Winterbottom said of his new protagonist\u2019s penchant for throwing celebrity parties: \u201cRichard McCreadie is a fictional character... we just didn\u2019t have enough money to make our party... ostentatious enough to match the real world.\u201d Green didn\u2019t get back to Capital for comment.\n\nCoffee fable\n\nA leading asset manager tells Capital he recently went for a coffee with a pal from an alternative investment consulting firm. The asset manager offered to buy the investment consultant a drink.\n\nThe consultant declined, on the grounds it could be construed as an inducement and said he would buy his own brew. The asset manager then couldn\u2019t pay for his own coffee as the minimum credit card spend at the establishment was \u00a35 and he lacked cash.\n\nThe consultant ended up buying both their drinks. Our caffeinated asset manager fumes: \u201cCan you imagine two Italian financiers worrying about such absurd rules over a few glasses of Chianti?\u201d", "description": "A book from Jennifer Arcuri next year will say nothing about the PM and two asset managers fret about buying each other a coffee", "authors": ["Tom Teodorczuk", "Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
