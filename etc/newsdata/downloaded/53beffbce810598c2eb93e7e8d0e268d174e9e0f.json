While previous iPhone SE 2 rumors have been scattered, this release window, along with other details regarding its supposed design from Kuo (via 9to5Mac), corroborates a recent report from Nikkei that echoes similar information.\n\nThe successor to the 2016 iPhone SE may look more like an iPhone 8 than an iPhone 5, Kuo predicts, which would give a more modern look to Apple\u2019s small, midrange phone. Should it absorb that design, some older iPhone features will be sticking around a little longer, like its Touch ID fingerprint sensor and thick top and bottom bezels. Last month, Bloomberg reported that Apple\u2019s next low-cost iPhone would resemble the iPhone 8 and feature Touch ID.\n\nOn the topic of performance, Kuo indicates that this 2020 device might feature an A13 processor and 3GB of RAM \u2014 more or less matching what\u2019s in the iPhone 11. This could be a powerful little phone, two descriptors that I know a lot of people (myself included) desire in a smartphone and are currently underserved. It just won\u2019t be quite as small and friendly to one-handed use as the iPhone 5-style SE was.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s not yet clear about the new device is its price. The main draw of the original iPhone SE was its $399 price, which helped Apple reach customers who didn\u2019t want to spend hundreds of dollars more on a flagship phone or who couldn\u2019t afford to. But with Apple\u2019s latest hardware said to be heading to the next iPhone SE iteration, color me skeptical that it will debut at the same price.\n\nEarly last year, Kuo claimed that the iPhone SE 2 wouldn\u2019t see a release, or at least it wasn\u2019t in the cards for a 2018 launch. That wasn\u2019t the final word we heard on the device that year, but things got quiet. It\u2019s hard to tell at this point if it will release, but the rumors seem to be converging on key details, so we may hear more soon.", "description": "Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 2 is back in the news after Ming-Chi Kuo, a reliable analyst on the Apple beat, put forward several details about the next iteration.
