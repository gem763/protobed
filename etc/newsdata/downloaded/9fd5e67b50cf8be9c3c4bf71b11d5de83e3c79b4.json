General Assembly invariably produces each year. And each year, certain enormous topics and certain louder voices dominate.\n\nHere, The Associated Press takes the opposite approach and spotlights some thoughts you might not have heard \u2014 the voices of leaders speaking at the United Nations who might not have captured the headlines and the airtime on Saturday, the fifth day of 2019 debate.\n\n___\n\n\"When I was a young boy in the Marshall Islands, the unavoidable sound of ocean waves crashing upon our coral reefs was, to me, a natural symphony. But to my grandchildren, this same sound is rapidly becoming, to them, a threat of inundation.

The long-term gains are far greater than any short-term costs. The prosperity of one nation is not part of a zero-sum game in which nations either win or lose.\"\n\n\u2014 Ann Linde, foreign minister of Sweden.\n\n___\n\n\"It is telling that advocates of multilateralism conveniently leave out issues of migration. Migration is as multilateral as it gets. Migration is the pervasive reality today. ... Migrant labor raises great cities out of deserts, mans the ships that enable global trade. Migrant health workers care for the sick, the children, the elderly, giving to strangers as much care as they gave their own loved ones back home. ... Migrants themselves are grateful for the love that is sometimes returned \u2014 and sad when they are hurt instead.\"\n\n\u2014 Teodoro Locsin Jr., foreign minister of The Philippines.\n\n___", "description": "Here, The Associated Press takes the opposite approach and spotlights some thoughts you might not have heard \u2014 the voices of leaders speaking at the United Nations who might not have captured the headlines and the airtime on Saturday, the fifth day of 2019 debate.  \"When I was a young boy in the", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1DpT5tFxJno80eRhONXp8g--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/956a5fe3c3fd162ee5294950bdf4d40e", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
