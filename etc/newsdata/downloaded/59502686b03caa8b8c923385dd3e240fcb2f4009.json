(Buffalo Police Department)\n\nShe had left the cardboard box on her porch for stray cats. But when Lois Augsburger headed out the door to pick up the newspaper the next morning, she found a little boy sleeping inside.\n\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d she told WGRZ outside her Buffalo home. \u201cHeartbreaking. I started crying. I\u2019ve been crying all day wondering about this little baby.\u201d\n\nThe Monday morning discovery was the start of a mystery that continues to puzzle police in western New York. Authorities identified the parents of the 3-year-old boy as Nicole Merced Plaud and Miguel Anthony Valentin-Colon of Orlando. But they haven\u2019t been able to find them \u2014 or a family friend, Dhamyl Mirella Roman-Audiffred.\n\nAnd hours after Augsburger stumbled upon the little boy, named Noelvin, police made another shocking find about a mile away: a burned-out car with what appeared to be human remains inside. The torched car, found behind a storage company in the city\u2019s Black Rock neighborhood, gave new weight to something the toddler had told Augsburger.\n\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018Where\u2019s your mommy, honey?' \u201d she recalled, according to WIVB. \u201cHe said, \u2018The car\u2019s on fire, the car\u2019s on fire.\u2019 That\u2019s all he kept saying.\u201d\n\n\n\nNicole Merced Plaud and Miguel Anthony Valentin-Colon are missing, along with a friend. Their 3-year-old was found on a stranger's porch in Buffalo. (Buffalo Police Department)\n\nAuthorities have yet to link the boy and the charred car, which is so badly damaged that investigators have been unable to determine even its make and model. During a Tuesday news conference, Buffalo Police Captain Jeff Rinaldo said it would \u201ctake some time\u201d for the medical examiner\u2019s office to identify the remains found inside.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle was badly, badly damaged from the fire, almost to the point that we cannot tell what type of vehicle it is or the contents of the vehicle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fire definitely burned extremely long, extremely hot and extinguished itself, which left little remnants of the vehicle.\u201d\n\nAlready, the missing couple\u2019s family fears the worst. Zenaida Colon, Valentin-Colon\u2019s mother, told WIVB that he, Plaud and their son had traveled to Buffalo with their friend. Colon, who flew to New York from Orlando on Monday to try to get custody of her grandson, said her family hadn\u2019t heard from her son since Sunday.\n\nNow, she worries the remains found inside the car are those of the couple.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we have a good outcome to this, but if we don\u2019t, at least we have peace of mind that they\u2019re there or they\u2019re not,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sooner, the better.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHe met his victims on Bumble and Tinder, prosecutors say.
