The Basic Law, which guarantees the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong's citizens, was developed on the basis of this agreement ... I have pointed out that these rights and freedoms must, of course, also be guaranteed,\" the chancellor added.\n\nThe Basic Law is Hong Kong's de facto constitution, which grants some democratic rights \u2014 such as press freedom \u2014 to the semiautonomous territory that are not afforded to mainland China.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by three months of demonstrations, triggered by a controversial extradition bill, with at times violent confrontations between police and protesters. The police response prompted an international outcry.\n\nThe city is bracing itself for another weekend of demonstrations. Although the territory's leader Carrie Lam this week withdrew the bill, activists say other key demands \u2014 such as the unconditional release of all arrested protesters \u2014 have not been met.\n\nMerkel on Friday called for deescalation, saying: \"Every effort must be made to avoid violence. Solutions can only be found politically, that is to say through dialogue.\"\n\nShortly after the news conference, Merkel attended an official welcome ceremony alongside Li. While Li stood during the Chinese national anthem, the chancellor remained seated during the German national anthem. Following several shaking bouts in public earlier this summer, Merkel has opted for a protocol change to remain seated during anthems at official ceremonies.\n\nOn Friday evening, the German chancellor is set to have dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping.", "description": "The German chancellor is currently on a three-day visit to China.", "authors": ["Judith Mischke", "Hans Von Der Burchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1172692556-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
