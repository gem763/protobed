Monday night the president's actions cut to the core of the country\u2019s defences.\n\nTheir views, as centrist lawmakers from previously Republican-held districts where Mr Trump has been popular, hold sway with party leadership.\n\nMr Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong and has denied that any requests for help in procuring damaging information about Mr Biden were tied to the aid freeze.\n\nDemocrats, and some Republicans, urged the White House to be open about his actions, which are at the centere of a whistle-blower complaint.\n\nBut with no new information from the administration forthcoming, more than a dozen Democrats, including some in House leadership, added their names to those calling for impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe president hinted that a transcript from his call may soon be provided to the public, saying on Tuesday he would \"assume\" that reporters will have access to the document in the coming days.\n\nCongress on Monday pressed for full disclosure of a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint about Mr Trump and pushed the White House to release a transcript of the call.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent
