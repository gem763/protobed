This time only verified votes will be accepted.\n\nThere are some concerns outstanding. Without a national biometric voter register, impersonation is possible, and while the machines are designed to transmit real-time data through a sim card, a quarter of polling stations do not have mobile coverage.\n\nThere is also the possibility that if ballot stuffing is ruled out, corrupt candidates will simply shift to other forms of cheating including trying to intimidate supporters of a rival candidate to stop them voting, or damaging ballot boxes from an opponent\u2019s stronghold to invalidate the votes inside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man tries to control his donkey loaded with ballot boxes and other election material as he transports them to polling stations in Shutul, Panjshir province.

When results are tallied at the end of voting the volunteer will take a picture of the results sheet and manually enter the vote total for each candidate.\n\nThose details will feed into a database that the team says will calculate final results either late on Saturday or the next morning, weeks before the official tally.\n\nOne official who worked on the app said they were confident about winning, and promised to announce details of their victory as soon as all results came in. Asked if they would still go ahead unveiling details if Ghani\u2019s main challenger Abdullah Abdullah seemed to have won, he declined to answer.", "description": "Authorities hope voter verification machines and apps can solve perpetual problem", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58781ec95b2b76c6f6312e39699480e096650b22/0_0_3224_1934/master/3224.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0efd15ee16e7408d969bf2172accc922", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
