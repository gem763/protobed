Some of the funds were spent on \u201cNatural Resources and Climate Change\u201d along with \u201cUrban and rural land management\u201d and \u201cCivil and human rights,\u201d CIMI says on its website.\n\nFor its part, a local branch of CIMI, the Indigenous Council of Roraima, received $1,164,906 from the Ford Foundation from 2006 until 2018, Pentin wrote.\n\nCIMI itself was founded by Erwin Kr\u00e4utler, emeritus bishop of Xingu, Brazil, who is an advocate for women\u2019s ordination as well as for ordaining married men in the Amazon to address the priest shortage.\n\nYet CIMI was not the only synod organization accepting the Ford Foundation\u2019s dirty money, Pentin said. Two other groups that work closely with REPAM have also received funding from the Ford Foundation, namely, the Coordinating Body for the Indigenous People\u2019 Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) and the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB)\n\nFrom 2007 to 2018, COICA received $4,097,535, reports show, while, COIAB has received $1,623,443 in roughly the same period, from 2010 to 2018.\n\nIn 2016, Pope Francis publicly refused a donation from the Argentinean government in the amount of over $1 million destined for the Scholas Occurrentes Pontifical Foundation, an organization commissioned by Francis when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires to promote social integration and a \u201cculture of encounter.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Francis explained to the leaders of Scholas Occurrentes that the Argentinean government has to meet many needs of the people, \u201cbut you have no right to ask them a penny. God always provides for us by divine providence.\u201d\n\nNot long before, Francis insisted in a General Audience that the People of God have no need of \u201cdirty money\u201d and that the Church would not accept funds from those who exploit people.\n\nRaising his voice in evident irritation, the Pope said that \u201csome benefactors of the Church come forward with their donation \u2014 \u2018take this for the Church\u2019 \u2014 but this offering is the fruit of the blood of so many exploited, mistreated, enslaved, underpaid people!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say to these people, \u2018Please, take back your check, burn it!\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nPope Francis has compared abortion to hiring a hit man to \u201ctake out\u201d a child, proposing that the abortion mentality mirrors that of the mafia.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Vatican synod of bishops on the Amazon region receives significant financing from the pro-abortion Ford Foundation, reveals a new report. | Latin America", "authors": ["Thomas D.
