Marko told Bild newspaper: \"There was no yellow light on his dashboard or on the pit wall so an engineer could not warn him.\"\n\nBut Villeneuve told Germany's Motorsport-Magazin.com that it is no excuse.\n\n\"What matters is the flag on the track. Everything else is a help. The first rule you learn is to obey the flags,\" he said.\n\nAs for Verstappen's behaviour overall, the 1997 world champion added: \"I think he's a bad role model.\n\n\"And not just for safety reasons. He was on pole and didn't think too much. That was not very clever.\"\n\nWorld championship leader Lewis Hamilton also joined Verstappen's critics, declaring: \"The FIA should be very strict in enforcing the yellow flag rule.\n\n\"I remember a GP2 driver in Monaco injuring one of the marshals, who are volunteers who risks their lives for the safety of the drivers on the track.\n\n\"Max knew that marshals or Valterri could be on the track and he ignored that,\" he said.", "description": "1997 world champion Jacques Villeneuve says Max Verstappen is a 'bad role model' following a yellow flag incident for Valtteri Bottas' crash.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5219/4cceb9e732f346a6bf51f8cfa5ba2f67.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
