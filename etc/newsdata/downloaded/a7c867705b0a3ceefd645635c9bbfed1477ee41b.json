Because he hurt a lot of people. And, by the way, there is a precedent for this: In financial services, if the CEO and the executives lie about the financials, they can be held personally accountable.\"\n\nAn editor's note from Willamette Week cited a professor from the University of Oregon, Tim Gleason, who said \"the likelihood of criminal action is rather slim.\" Zuckerberg has dodged shareholder questions about whether he would be willing to step down as Facebook CEO or chairman.\n\nSenator Wyden introduced a bill in 2018, the Consumer Data Protection Act, that would give the FTC power to crack down harder on companies who violate consumer privacy. The bill says executives could face up to 20 years in prison and up to a $5 million personal fine.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion, the largest ever imposed by the FTC against a tech company, after it started probing the company's privacy practices in March 2018. The FTC focused on a massive data breach that gave Cambridge Analytics access to private data from 87 million Facebook users. Facebook, the FTC said, was supposed to tell users when their data was being used by third party firms.\n\nThe SEC also announced that Facebook will pay a $100 million fine for misleading investors about the risks it faced from the misuse of user data. \"For more than two years, Facebook's public disclosures presented the risk of misuse of user data as merely hypothetical when Facebook knew that a third-party developer had actually misused Facebook user data,\" the SEC said in July.\n\nRead more on Willamette Week.", "description": "Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said the \"possibility of a prison term\" should be considered for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a recent interview.", "authors": ["Todd Haselton"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104752379-GettyImages-822551776-ron-wyden.jpg?v=1551718919"}
