While at Konami, he created the Suikoden series, and more recently did the scenario for The Alliance Alive. During the Tokyo Game Show, I sat down with Maruyama and asked him how he writes JRPGs.\n\nAccording to Maruyama, back when he created Suikoden, the plan was to do a gunzougeki or \u201can ensemble piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I did my presentation at Konami, I said I wanted to do it like the Suikoden (the original Chinese novel), and the project got greenlit,\u201d Maruyama continued. The Suikoden series is based on the classic Chinese novel Shuihu Zhuan (the Water Margin), which is called Suikoden in Japan. \u201cThat\u2019s how the game became Suikoden, the game.\u201d\n\nAll of the different characters would provide plenty of fodder for the story.\n\n\u201cFor me, I always put lots of emphasis on the story,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the time I created Suikoden and now, there isn\u2019t much difference in how the story is created.\u201d He still comes up with the tale he wants to tell the player, but acknowledges that the biggest changes have been how the characters are rendered in-game or how the use of cutscenes has increased.\n\nBut JRPGs are still massive, taking at least 40 hours (or way more) to play through. That\u2019s a lot of a story, a lot of dialogue, and a lot of writing.\n\n\u201cIt usually takes me about three months to come up with the plot,\u201d Maruyama said. \u201cAfter that, we come up with a prototype, which takes about half a year. Then sitting down to actually write the words is another half a year. So, I\u2019m working on it for about a year and a half.\u201d His work is done before the actual game production begins.\n\n\u201cWhat I try to do is put the characters in situations that will get them to react a particular way.\u201d\n\nWhen he sits down to create a JRPG, he first tries to figure out who each of the characters is. \u201cFor me, the story is how the characters progress. So, I need to think about what type of person is going to appear in the game. For The Alliance Alive, I needed to consider what each of these characters is thinking as well as the world in which they exist. As I was thinking about the character, I was thinking about the setting. Then, I would decide what they would do, what they wanted, and what they were thinking.\u201d\n\nBy clearly defining the characters and the world, telling the story feels natural.\n\n\u201cTo some extent, at the very beginning, a basic plot is decided,\u201d Maruyama explained. \u201cIn order to arrive at that point, I know we need to have certain things happen or certain scenes. However, within all of that, the characters have their own wants and desires, so as they come to life, they have freedom. If I just place them in a straight line, things will be boring. What I try to do is put the characters in situations that will get them to react a particular way.\u201d\n\nEven though he lays things out, the process isn\u2019t prescriptive. \u201cSometimes, I think that a character will probably react in a certain way. What I\u2019m trying to get them to do is direct them towards a goal.\u201d\n\nMaruyama\u2019s process is organic. Because he thinks deeply about each character early in the process, he understands what they want and how they react. He has an idea of who they are. This helps him herd them naturally towards the climax. This is his strength as a storyteller.\n\n\u201cI have the big picture of where the characters need to go, but I don\u2019t force them,\u201d Maruyama said. \u201cDoing so would destroy them as characters. So what I try is how I can get them to get them headed in a particular direction. I think, for example, if I do something, then perhaps the character will react a certain way, and that brings the character to life.\u201d\n\nUnlike a novel, which involves the reader\u2019s imagination, a game actively involves the player in the storytelling process. Surely that makes writing JRPGs difficult, I asked.\n\n\u201cI have the big picture of where the characters need to go, but I don\u2019t force them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done more than just writing,\u201d Maruyama replied.\n\n\u201cSince the first Suikoden, I\u2019ve worked as a director, so I\u2019m aware of how much time players need to play, how much story they need, and how to balance that. I\u2019ve been doing this for decades, so there are techniques involved. If you had never done this, writing an RPG might be difficult.\u201d\n\nIn closing, I asked Maruyama to define what he thought JRPGs were. \u201cJapanese role-playing games are like bentos. You have all these different dishes you can enjoy in the bento box.\u201d Then what would he compare Western RPGS to? \u201cThey\u2019re like steak,\u201d he replied, smiling and gesturing cutting a big hunk of meat.\n\nThe Alliance Alive HD Remastered, Maruyama\u2019s most recent JRPG saga, will be released on the Nintendo Switch next month.", "description": "If there\u2019s one thing Yoshitaka Murayama knows better than most people in the world, it\u2019s how to bring Japanese role-playing games to life.
