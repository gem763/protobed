Rep. Anthony Brindisi (N.Y.): It makes sense why he\u2019s on this list. He is the only Democrat to win a district in 2018 that Trump won by more than 15 points, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Now he\u2019s a top target of Republicans, who are determined to prove his win was a fluke and that Upstate New York is still their territory.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying about impeachment: Interestingly, he\u2019s using a lot of the same language that his colleagues who do support it use.\n\nThe allegations surrounding an intelligence official\u2019s whistleblower complaint are incredibly concerning. (1/5) \u2014 Rep. Anthony Brindisi (@RepBrindisi) September 24, 2019\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want an impeachment inquiry vote, though, arguing it would \u201cplay into Republican hands.\u201d\n\n2. Rep. Joe Cunningham (S.C.): He won an impressive election last year in a Republican district in South Carolina (Trump won it by 13 points two years earlier), and, like Brindisi, The Fix has him on our list of top 10 House races most likely to flip.\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying about impeachment: as little as possible. Here\u2019s what he told NPR\u2019s Tim Mak in October:\n\nCunningham: I\u2019ve been supportive of an investigation to get to the bottom of the facts. And, you know... Mak: Is there a distinction between an investigation to get to the bottom of the facts and an impeachment inquiry? Cunningham: Well, I mean, I guess I\u2019ll leave it to other people to decide, like, what \u2014 you know, as to the details of that.\n\n\u201cPeople recognize that no one is above the law,\u201d he told CQ Roll Call, also in October. \u201cThese allegations against the president are concerning, and a lot of people are deeply troubled by them. It\u2019s just important that we get to the bottom of those, and wherever the facts go, the law must follow.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n3. Rep. Jared Golden (Maine): Golden, a Marine veteran, knocked off a Republican in rural Maine last year and became one of the state\u2019s first big victors in ranked-choice voting. But his narrow win reflects his district\u2019s conservative roots. He voted against Nancy Pelosi for House speaker, and he also once worked on Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins\u2019s staff.\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying about impeachment: Golden is saying he doesn\u2019t support an impeachment inquiry until he knows the president\u2019s intent in asking Ukraine for a favor to investigate Democrats. \u201cDid the president put his personal gain above the best interest of the country, or did he in fact believe that this was what he should be doing?\u201d Golden said, according to the Bangor Daily News.\n\nOf course, what he\u2019s not saying is that intent is nearly impossible to divine. Unless, of course, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff says there was the intent to hold up military aid for political purposes. But after that, Golden issued a statement saying he hadn\u2019t changed his mind. Somewhat perplexingly, he wants an investigation before the impeachment investigation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy position regarding the establishment of an impeachment inquiry has not changed \u2014 I will continue to treat this process with the seriousness it deserves. I plan to stay the course and continue to withhold final judgment until the investigation concludes. #mepolitics pic.twitter.com/n0Z6LcNM33 \u2014 Congressman Jared Golden (@RepGolden) October 18, 2019\n\n4. Rep. Kendra Horn (Okla.): Horn sits in another district that Democrats flipped in an area that Trump won by double digits in 2016. Political analysts say Horn\u2019s win in Oklahoma City was one of the biggest surprises for Democrats in all of 2018.\n\nWhat she\u2019s saying about impeachment: She stresses she didn\u2019t support the impeachment inquiry to begin with, but \u201cat this point, you know, the horse is out of the barn in terms of the investigation,\u201d she told KGOU\u2019s Capitol Insider in October. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important for us to have all the facts, and I will make a decision based on the facts and, I think, the investigation.\u201d\n\n5. Rep. Collin C. Peterson (Minn.): He has represented a rural Minnesota district for nearly three decades. But Trump won it by 30 percentage points in 2016, and Peterson could have a real Republican challenger for the first time in a while next year, including the state\u2019s former lieutenant governor. So Peterson is being extra careful with his statements, at times sounding more like a Republican than a Democrat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat he\u2019s said about impeachment: \u201cHe has called the impeachment process futile, unnecessarily divisive and a bad use of Congress\u2019 time,\u201d reports the StarTribune.\n\n6. Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.): Even though he\u2019s not one of the most endangered Democrats on this list, Van Drew has a conservative streak that matches the conservative New Jersey district he won in 2018. When he said in September that none of the evidence so far supports impeachment, Trump thanked him in a tweet.\n\n....we are going to have an Election very shortly.\u201d Rep. Jeff Van Drew, Democrat of New Jersey. @foxandfriends Thank you. Just another Witch Hunt by Nancy Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying about impeachment: For being such a vocal opponent to impeachment, he\u2019s actually kind of okay with the inquiry itself. \u201cAll that\u2019s swirling around us now is impeachment. We talk about it day and night. It\u2019s what\u2019s on the news. And frankly, I think it\u2019s fine if they still want to continue to have the type of investigations they did to see if something new turns up,\u201d he said in September after the whistleblower complaint was released.\n\nBut more recently, he\u2019s saying stuff like this: \u201cEverybody says, \u2018Be on the right side of history\u2019 \u2014 I think the right side of history is not to impeach,\u201d he told NBC last week.\n\nAD", "description": "They all represent districts that Trump won in 2016.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6QVsriKjMyAzzWi-KsC6li1xKcM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PCMSX3VRXYI6TLGIDWCHXLGKOM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
