That would have entailed a flag plant at the 50-yard line and an additional victory lap around the field.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Texas was on the losing end of a flag plant, either. Six weeks after Mayfield debuted the move, he did it again when the Sooners took down the Longhorns in October 2017, though that was at the neutral site Cotton Bowl game in Dallas. But you get the point.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike many things meant to be fun in sports, Mayfield\u2019s 2017 demonstration was not well-received all around. He apologized a few days later, clarifying that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean for it to be disrespectful at all.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s totally possible college sports fans have evolved in the last two years and LSU won\u2019t get any hate this time around. But who are we kidding?\n\nLSU planted a school flag in Texas' field after the Tigers defeated the longhorns 45-38 Saturday.
