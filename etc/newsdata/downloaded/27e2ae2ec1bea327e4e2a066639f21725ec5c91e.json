There is absolutely no justification for a Labour MP wanting to keep Boris Johnson in No 10, but by refusing to back a general election that is precisely what they\u2019re doing. The EU27 will not agree to any meaningful changes to the withdrawal agreement unless the government changes and the negotiating principles change with it. So to stop a no-deal Brexit \u2013 even if article 50 is extended \u2013 we will in all probability have to win some version of a public vote: either a general election that elects a Labour government, or a second referendum with an option to remain.\n\nDevoid of any serious or coherent domestic agenda, the Conservatives are seeking to engineer an election defined by Brexit \u2013 a proxy second referendum. But Theresa May tried this in 2017 after she triggered article 50, and she lost seats. Because general elections are about much more than a single issue, they are about the future of the country. Labour can move the agenda on from Brexit, just as it did in 2017. The government may well be trying to engineer an election at what they assume is the best time for a Conservative victory \u2013 but that is always the way with these things. It is no reason to retreat. Any panic is unwarranted \u2013 this is a political impasse which requires a political solution. It\u2019s exactly what elections are for.\n\nSo if the objective is to stop no deal, a general election on 14 October that puts Corbyn into No 10 is the path of least resistance \u2013 a far less uncertain prospect than a second referendum with no deal on the ballot, a vote that would be defined purely by a single issue and the principle of respecting democracy. Under all circumstances, Labour MPs must back a general election as soon as possible.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018If we allow Boris Johnson to hold a snap election in the next month he can mix up the Brexit question with questions over Jeremy Corbyn,\u2019 says Kyle. Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\n\u2022 Matt Zarb-Cousin is the former spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn\n\nPeter Kyle: We need a referendum, not a general election\n\nI will not dance to Boris Johnson\u2019s tune. He wants chaos at any cost, but what our country really needs is for us to stop no deal, resolve Brexit, and then allow the public to decide the future direction for the country in a general election \u2013 not the other way round.\n\nJohnson knows that if no-deal Brexit were to stand on its own as a general election proposition, it may well fail. But if we allow him to hold a snap election in the next month, he can mix up the Brexit question with questions over Corbyn, while at the same time offering huge public spending incentives on policing and health. This could succeed in returning him to Downing Street, a victory for his no-deal Brexit, despite a majority of the public being against it.\n\nBrexit is the biggest issue our country has faced in the last 70 years, and it needs to be debated and voted on as a standalone issue.\n\nThe ballot we need at this present time is not a general election but a referendum: a public vote on any deal (or no deal) that Johnson intends to deliver. Only after the country has decided on Brexit, based on facts not promises, should we move to a general election. Only after the country has resolved Brexit can we openly and honestly discuss how our country should be run and which party is best placed to run it. A pre-Brexit election would not permit this, which is why I will not vote for a general election at this moment.\n\nLet the public decide on Boris\u2019s deal, and then let\u2019s fight an election on manifestos that will allow us to discuss openly, outside the shadow of Brexit, the issues of our NHS, social care, housing, jobs and the many challenges facing our economy and country.\n\n\u2022 Peter Kyle is MP for Hove and Portslade", "description": "Matt Zarb-Cousin and Peter Kyle go head to head on whether Labour should back a general election", "authors": ["Matt Zarb-Cousin", "Peter Kyle", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3807860d5d6c5661f1565f152e16b59ec375a6a/0_21_4440_2664/master/4440.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9b9abeb7b53b4a9d141c7d0560fd9bfd"}
