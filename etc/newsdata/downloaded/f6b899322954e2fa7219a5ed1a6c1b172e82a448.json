The fund outperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis. We captured 94% of the S&P 500\u2019s return while taking on only 64% of the market\u2019s risk. \u25a0 Given that we are in the latter stages of an economic expansion, faced with an inverted yield curve, potential for increased policy uncertainty, and strained relations between the U.S. and China, we have taken a cautious view, reducing the fund\u2019s equity exposure and fixed income duration. \u25a0 We do not know what future gross domestic product growth will be, and we are not in the recession forecasting business. We deal with probabilities. When the market becomes convinced that there is no risk of a recession and valuations rise, we will take the over and be more conservatively positioned. When the market becomes convinced that there is a high risk of a recession\u2014as it did in November and December of last year\u2014and valuations become more attractive, we will take the under and be more aggressively positioned.\n\nSo, what is going on?\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018 the market essentially became gripped with fear, to put it bluntly. Fear of a Federal Reserve-induced recession as it was raising rates too aggressively. Fear of an inverted yield curve and the historically very negative intermediate-term consequences. Fear of a trade war with China. Those fears drove the market down 20% from its September peak and pushed the market multiple down to 13.8x forward earnings.\n\nBased on our calculations, at the market bottom on Christmas Eve of last year, the market was pricing in a 50% chance of a near-term recession. As recently as September of last year, the market was essentially pricing in a 0% chance of a recession. As a result, the market went from being expensive to being attractive in a relatively short period of time. We took advantage of this opportunity by aggressively adding to equities and went overweight equities on Christmas Eve of last year. This decision has also aided our performance in the first half of 2019, as we will talk about later.\n\nFast forwarding to the first half of 2019: From a fundamental perspective, not much has really changed despite the strong equity and fixed income returns. The threat of a trade war with China is still a risk. The yield curve remains inverted. U.S. earnings have not surprised to the upside. The large fiscal stimulus that drove outsized gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2018 is likely to wane in 2019 and potentially be a headwind to growth in 2020\u20132021. We are at the beginning of an election cycle with two parties that generally have very different views on tax and regulatory policies, which could result in increased policy uncertainty in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe only thing that has really changed is that the Federal Reserve has reversed course and is now likely to start cutting interest rates as opposed to raising them. This has reduced the fears of a Fed-induced recession. However, in an era of very low absolute interest rates, structurally lower growth rates, and a more service-based economy, the impact from small changes in Federal Reserve rates is vastly overestimated by the market. With the notable exception of the housing market\u2014and, to a lesser extent, the automotive market\u2014whether the Federal Reserve sets its target for the federal funds rate at 1.5% or 2.5% is far less important than it used to be. Taking interest rates close to zero and later deploying massive quantitative easing in the U.S. did not result in structurally faster GDP growth coming out of the last recession. Similarly, the move to negative interest rates in Europe and Japan has not revived their moribund economies.\n\nWith the market now surpassing its September 2018 peak, investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates and that the lower rates will reignite GDP growth and keep the U.S. out of a recession. It is quite possible that GDP growth may get better (and possible it could get worse), but the impact on growth from Fed policy is very unlikely to be a major factor either way.\n\nSo, once again, we find ourselves in a situation in which the market is essentially pricing in a 0% chance of a recession. Given that we are undoubtedly in the latter stages of an economic expansion with an inverted yield curve, potential for increased policy uncertainty, and strained relations with China, this strikes us as being both optimistic and illogical. As a result, we have been gradually paring the risk profile of your fund by reducing our equity exposure and lowering the duration of our corporate debt holdings.\n\nWe don\u2019t pretend to know what GDP growth will be in 2019, 2020, or 2021, and we are not in the recession forecasting business. We deal with probabilities. When the market becomes convinced that there is 0% risk of a recession and valuations rise, we will take the over and be more conservatively positioned. When the market becomes convinced that there is a high risk of a recession\u2014as it did in November and December of last year\u2014and valuations become more attractive, we will take the under and be more aggressively positioned. When an outcome is uncertain, like with GDP growth or interest rates, but the market prices in a very high probability of one outcome, taking the opposite view can create a very positively skewed risk-adjusted return. This works for macro variables such as GDP, interest rates, and currency, and it can also work for sectors that can be influenced by these variables.\n\nLast year, your portfolio management team went from being underweight utilities at the start of the year to being massively overweight in February\u2013March, and by September, we were about 1,000 basis points overweight to the sector. There were multiple reasons for this decision, including the fact that utilities\u2019 growth rates have increased due to structural factors, other defensive sectors face secular risks to their business models, and utilities are the one sector that could potentially benefit from a regime change in the U.S. 2020 presidential elections. However, in the very short term, the reason we got this opportunity was because the market was convinced interest rates would go straight up, and no one wants to own utilities when interest rates are going up. Yet, utilities were already trading at discounted valuations that mostly reflected this market perception. Hence, if interest rates increased and valuations fell to absolute trough relative valuation levels, we thought we could still likely generate low-single-digit returns over the intermediate term. Given our mandate of preserving capital over the intermediate term, when a worst-case outcome is low-single-digit returns, that is something that excites us.\n\nBut what if interest rates declined? No one thought it was possible, and, again, the market was embedding in the valuations of utilities a very high probability that rates would increase. When interest rates fell, many of our utilities appreciated by 40% or more over the next year or so and vastly outperformed the market. The market had essentially said the odds of interest rates going up were 90%+, when in fact they were probably closer to 50%. We did not know which way rates were going to go, but because the market had put way too high of a probability on an uncertain outcome, we had the opportunity to invest in a very positively skewed risk-adjusted return opportunity that ultimately generated significant alpha for our shareholders.", "description": "( link ) so many nuggets in this report.
