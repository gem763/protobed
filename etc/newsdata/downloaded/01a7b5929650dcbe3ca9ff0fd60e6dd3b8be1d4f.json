His parents, though, also encouraged him to take the DISC (dominance, influence, steadiness, compliance) personality test, which showed he was well-suited to the world of logistics and to his current role at Ralph Lauren.\n\nWhile completing his secondary education in Beijing, Wu had applied to universities in Hong Kong and China, but like many people his age was still unsure what career path to pursue.\n\nHowever, the results of the DISC test showed he leaned towards compliance and dominance, indicating that his strongest traits were to be conscientious, process-driven, decisive and results-focused.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I thought studying supply chain management would be a good fit for me,\u201d he says.\n\nPolyU graduate Woody Wu now works as a supply chain manager at clothing giant Ralph Lauren.

This requires extensive supply chain expertise, so that each item gets to the right place at the right time.\n\nWu believes his previous roles gave him a good foundation in terms of industry knowledge and understanding what service providers must offer. In the last financial year, his team handled 50 new shop openings.\n\n\u201cI can apply much of what I learned at university in my current work,\u201d Wu says, adding that courses like management science gave him the tools to make efficient decisions in running warehouse and transportation operations. \u201cThe project work at PolyU covered situations that closely resemble what happens in real life and highlighted factors that must be taken into consideration.\u201d\n\nDuring his time at PolyU, Wu was also an exchange student at the University of Texas in San Antonio. He completed five business courses there, was able to transfer the credits back to PolyU, and even found time for a coast-to-coast trip during which he visited San Francisco, New York, Washington DC and took in many famous sights. Wu also made new friends from around the world by playing for the university\u2019s table tennis club and joining in pick-up basketball games. It is a kind of overseas experience he thoroughly recommends.\n\nHis top three reasons for working in supply chain management (SCM) are:\n\n1. Being able to look at the big picture and optimise every opportunity in figuring out what is most important.\n\n2. Making new connections with people in other industries and learning about other companies outside the field of logistics.\n\n3. Always having opportunities to accumulate more knowledge about front and back-end operations and putting that to good use.\n\nEdited by John Cremer\n\nYou might also like:\n\nHere's why studying aviation at PolyU opens up a world of opportunities\n\nLearn about why logistics are the lifeblood of a city with PolyU's undergraduate degree in Transport Logistics\n\nA dynamic career in international transport logistics", "description": "Sponsored Feature", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/supply-chain-management-shutterstock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
