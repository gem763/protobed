At least 20 people were killed on the archipelago.\n\nWhat did the president say in recent days about Alabama?\n\nIt began on Sunday morning when Mr Trump tweeted: \"In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, the National Weather Service tweeted from Birmingham, Alabama, contradicting the president.\n\nBut Mr Trump soon afterwards on Sunday told reporters at the White House: \"Alabama is going to get a piece of it, it looks like.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aerials show scale of destruction in the Bahamas caused by Hurricane Dorian\n\nAbout an hour later, he said at a Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) briefing that the hurricane \"may get a little piece of a great place: It's called Alabama\".\n\nThe same day, NOAA spokesman Christopher Vaccaro made clear in an email to reporters: \"The current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama.\"\n\nOn Monday, media organisations said Mr Trump was incorrect about Alabama.\n\nHe seized on remarks by ABC News' White House correspondent Jon Karl, who noted the president had \"misstated the storm's possible trajectory\".\n\nMr Trump tweeted on Monday: \"Such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonkarl of @ABCWorldNews.\n\n\"I suggested yesterday at FEMA that, along with Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, even Alabama could possibly come into play, which WAS true.\"\n\nAccording to AP news agency, forecasts from last Friday indicated that a small strip of Alabama might be affected by Dorian.\n\nHowever, by Saturday morning meteorologists were no longer predicting the southern state would be in the hurricane's path.\n\nIt was 24 hours later that Mr Trump began asserting that Alabama was at risk from Dorian.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Mr Trump cited the original forecasts to argue that he was right all along.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump This was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies! pic.twitter.com/0uCT0Qvyo6 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019 Report\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley confirmed the map had been altered with a black felt-tip pen, known as a sharpie in the US, but did not say who made the edit.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @hogangidley45 Absolutely right @realDonaldTrump! Watching the media go ballistic over a black sharpie mark on a map would be hilarious if it weren\u2019t so sad. The real news that matters here is a deadly hurricane continues up the coast and tens millions of Americans could be greatly impacted. https://t.co/SceSOeuyO5 \u2014 Hogan Gidley (@hogangidley45) September 5, 2019 Report\n\nBy Thursday morning #sharpiegate was trending on Twitter in the US and the president tweeted again about Alabama.\n\nSkip Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump Alabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News! \u2014 Donald J.
