Allen said, \u201cWe do whatever we do to make it as safe as possible. And if what\u2019s as safe as possible is to wait for that individual to leave the house, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Most of the time there will be other laws that we\u2019ll be able to apply.\u201d\n\nDawn Principe, the owner of Sage Hill Arms in Winnemucca, is leading Humboldt County 2nd Amendment Grassroots in an effort to recall Allen.\n\nAllen\u2019s plan to enforce the state\u2019s red flag law comes less than a month after the Humboldt County Commissioners adopted \u201cSecond Amendment Sanctuary\u201d status. The sanctuary declaration says, in part, \u201cNeither the United States Congress nor the Nevada legislature should entertain consideration of any legislation that would infringe on constitutionally protected rights under the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nSheriff Allen spoke with Breitbart News, saying, \u201cWhere in the U.S. Constitution, or the Nevada constitution, can I pick and choose what laws I enforce?\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the Second Amendment Sanctuary declaration in particular, Allen said, \u201cThere\u2019s no legal basis for the sanctuary declaration, for a sanctuary basis.\u201d\n\nAllen added, \u201cI\u2019ve never violated anybody\u2019s constitutional rights, nor will I.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI stand by the Second Amendment and everybody\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
