This starts with compensating them fairly and providing important benefits.\"\n\nNow there was no legal obligation tied to the statement, after all it's just a mission statement from what is essentially a lobbying group, but the companies \u2014 and even companies whose CEOs did not sign the pledge \u2014 emphasized that this was a serious statement of intent.\n\nSo what then to make of Whole Foods' decision to cut the medical benefits of part-time workers? The decision will, as one employee affected by the change told Business Insider's Hayley Peterson, leave employees and families who rely on those benefits in the lurch.\n\nAmazon argues that the changes will only affect 2% of the Whole Foods workforce (which also begs the question: if it's such a small number, why not just leave the benefits in place?), but that the changes will still affect as many as 1,900 employees.\n\nAmazon contends that some of these employees will move to full-time hours and the change will \"create a more equitable and efficient scheduling model.\" But some employees may not be able to add hours and will be forced to look for more expensive coverage or a new job with benefits. The bottom line is that employees who had health coverage in their current role no longer have those benefits.\n\nThe move was roundly criticized online, with commentators pointing out that not only is Amazon one of the most valuable companies in the world, but that Bezos himself is the wealthiest man on Earth.\n\nWords are just that: words\n\nThe Whole Foods move shows that for all the good intentions or press releases about taking care of employees, companies are ultimately worried about their bottom line and what's best for the corporation \u2014 even if that runs roughshod over employees' needs.\n\nThere are ways for Bezos to address the apparent hypocrisy of the move. The Amazon CEO can show that he's committed to the values listed in the Business Roundtable statement by restoring healthcare benefits to the part-time Whole Food employees and, if he really wanted to live by his pledge, go the other way and extend benefits to more workers.\n\nBut even if Bezos and Whole Foods were to reverse course, the situation also makes clear that workers cannot rely on high-minded promises from their executives or companies. Even if Bezos is committed to the ideals of the Business Roundtable statement, there may be other decision makers within Amazon who aren't as concerned, to say nothing of the fact that Bezos might leave.\n\nThis means that for workers to make lasting change and ensure that companies do invest in and take care of employees, structural changes must be adopted. Workers can support politicians who advocate for policies that protect workers and ensure that companies are held accountable. Workers can also band together through a union to create a collectively bargained legal framework to make sure benefits can't be suddenly taken away.\n\nRegardless of the ultimate solution, the Whole Foods healthcare decision proves that while CEOs love to make extravagant statements about taking care of their workers, there's no guarantee that they'll actually practice what they preach.", "description": "In August, Jeff Bezos signed a letter committing to invest in employees.
