You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFor a moment, those waking up on Friday morning might have imagined themselves to have accidentally hibernated all the way through to May, and were instead listening to the Reith lectures on the Irish backstop.\n\nWhatever happens, this was a highly refreshing approach. It was the BBC\u2019s Justin Webb who had introduced him, before hanging up his microphone and, presumably, getting on with a fiendishly difficult sudoku for the next quarter of an hour or so.\n\nThis is not to criticise the man. Not in the slightest. For it turns out, if a politician actually intends to answer a simple question with the simple honest truth, they really can go on forever almost without interruption.\n\nAt one point, at the end, Coveney spoke for a full 256 seconds without interruption. We presume Nicholas Parsons has already put a call in.\n\nAnd, frankly, why would you need to interrupt? For the last few days, murmurings from Westminster and indeed from Brussels have intimated that an actual deal between the UK and the EU might be forthcoming. Or, at least, that is how those murmurs have been interpreted in the UK.\n\nAnd here was Simon Coveney, patiently, forensically and honestly explaining why such talk is utter rubbish.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are serious problems that emerge because of the change of British prime minister. He is asking to remove a significant section within the withdrawal agreement, that solves many of the Irish issues, without any serious proposals as to how you solve those problems. This is not going to be the basis for an agreement.\u201d\n\nOh. So that\u2019s that then. He was saying this stuff on what would be morning 31, after the 30 days Angela Merkel gave Boris Johnson to come up with some workable solutions for the backstop. No such solutions have been forthcoming.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

That is an unfair request and it won\u2019t be the basis of a deal.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so much a pouring of cold water on the situation as a dawn raid by one of those planes that sweep over the sea, picking up hundreds of tonnes of ocean then dumping them on top of forest fires.\n\nWhat he said was exactly what Jean-Claude Juncker and the rest have been saying for days, weeks, months and years. That the backstop can go, just as soon as something that can replace it turns up. That is, quite literally, the entire point of the backstop.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at it for three years,\u201d said Coveney. \u201cThere have been a number of proposed solutions. When they\u2019ve been tested they haven\u2019t stood up to scrutiny.\u201d\n\nArguably, all this was very unfair. Who does Simon Coveney think he is? All this telling the truth, explaining that there\u2019s a problem. Why can\u2019t he just do the decent thing and lie and lie and lie and lie and lie?\n\nWhy can\u2019t he, for example, just say that the chances of no deal are \u201ca million to one\u201d, as Boris Johnson did when campaigning for the leadership, knowing the whole time that his intention would be to pursue a policy that would make no deal inevitable?\n\nWhy can\u2019t he just think of these things in terms of pure politics, and narrow electoral interest, and not get bogged down in the nitty-gritty of the real lives of little people?\n\nWhy does he have to stick, for example, to this kind of nonsense:\n\n\u201cWhat we won\u2019t do is pretend we\u2019re solving a problem to get over a political obstacle, and then say, in a few months\u2019 time, actually it doesn\u2019t work at all.\u201d\n\nWhat a spoilsport. Does he not get this isn\u2019t how Brexit works at all? It\u2019s easy. You lie yourself into a corner, then you lie your way out of it.\n\nThere was, in fairness, one slight problem. The backstop works for Ireland, it even has majority support in Northern Ireland, but as yet, it doesn\u2019t quite have the approval of the Northern Irish unionist community. You don\u2019t have to have paid too close attention to the last two, three, 10, 20 or 50 years to know that you don\u2019t get much done in Northern Irish politics without the consent of both sides.\n\nStill, one of the unfortunate realities of Brexit, is that, having voted to \u201ctake back control\u201d, the UK finds itself, for the first time ever, being told what to do by little old Ireland. On this evidence, thank goodness for that.
