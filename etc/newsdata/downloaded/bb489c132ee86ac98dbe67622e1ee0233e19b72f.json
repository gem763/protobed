He has vowed to review the company's North American portfolio and restructure some other units and exit unprofitable businesses.\n\nSchlumberger, an industry bellwether, said revenue from its international business rose 8% to $5.63 billion in the third quarter, while revenue from North America fell 11% to $2.85 billion.\n\nThe company reported a net loss of $11.38 billion, compared with a net profit of $644 million a year earlier, hit by a goodwill impairment charge of $12.7 billion.\n\nLe Peuch had already prepared investors for the charge, saying it would be \"significant\" when he delivered his first public remarks last month.\n\nExcluding the charge and other items, the company earned 43 cents per share, beating estimates of 40 cents, according Refinitiv IBES data.\n\nTotal revenue was largely unchanged at $8.54 billion, but beat expectation of $8.50 billion.\n\nShares of the Houston, Texas-based company rose 1.44% to $32.35 before the bell.
