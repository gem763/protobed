I think my first words were: \"No! No! No!\"'\n\nHinkley said he and his friend Chris went into a 'mild panic' - before he tried to take care of the injury himself.\n\nThe two men took turns holding the camera as they filmed Hinkley's efforts to remove the nail.\n\nWARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT\n\nDerek Hinkley filmed himself trying to pull a three-inch nail out of his thigh on September 27\n\nHinkley was building a playground pirate ship with his friend in Savannah, Georgia, when he misfired the nail gun and impaled his leg\n\n'Many times in construction things happen you can usually band-aid a problem or simply yank out a sliver of whatever,' Hinkley said.\n\n'I quickly realized this would not be a quick extraction in the field.'\n\nThe stomach-churning video shows Hinkley wincing in pain as he used a pair of pliers to see if the three-inch penny nail would budge.\n\nHe explained that the penny nail was 'ring-shanked' - meaning that it has ridges along the three-inch shaft, making it harder to pull out of wood, or in this case, bone.\n\nIt didn't take long for Hinkley to determine that there was no way he could get the nail out himself. Thankfully, Chris had already called an ambulance.\n\nHinkley quickly realized there was no way he could remove the large nail himself\n\nFirst responders are seen securing Hinkley's leg before taking him to the hospital\n\nHe filmed himself inside the ambulance (left) and at the hospital (right), where doctors gave him intense pain medication before extracting the nail\n\nHinkley explained that the nail (pictured) was 'ring-shanked' - meaning that it has ridges along the three-inch shaft, making it harder to pull out of wood, or in this case, bone\n\nThe builder appeared surprisingly unpreturbed by the injury for the first half of the video as he described what was happening to the camera.\n\nHe said he started to feel pain on the way to the hospital, where he was hooked up to an IV and given an anesthetic.\n\n'The next few minutes we\u2019re some pretty terrifying ones, probably the most terrifying of my life,' Hinkley said.\n\n'The medication, ketamine, took me on a spectacular trip and not a good one.\n\n'Either way I did not feel the pain of the nail being yanked out, so at the end of the day I guess it was a good decision.'\n\nHinkley was released from the hospital soon after and went straight back to the build site, where he and Chris finished putting together the pirate ship.\n\nHe shared his video of the incident on Facebook to warn other builders about being careful with construction tools, even if they have years of experience like he does.", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.
