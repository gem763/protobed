The implication seeming to be that he was worried that Pelosi or members of Congress would leak this. Does the president not trust the Speaker of the House with sensitive national security information?\u201d\n\nPence said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that was the implication at all. I think from the time that we got actionable intelligence, the president\u2019s total focus here was on a successful mission and the safety of American troops.\u201d\n\nWallace pressed, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell Nancy Pelosi?\u201d\n\nPence said, \u201cWe maintain the tightest possible security here and when we got the confirmation on Saturday that al-Baghdadi was on site and our troops began to move into the region has the president said, our aircraft were moving over some very potentially hostile areas. We wanted them to be able to get in and get out, it\u2019s a dangerous mission on the ground. They went with the resolve in the determination as president to bring al-Baghdadi to justice but they also went with our prayers and I just couldn\u2019t be more proud. When they were wheels up out of country, no American casualties and al-Baghdadi is dead.\u201d\n\nWallace pressed, \u201cWe all applaud that. I do want to ask you, it is my job as a newsman, respectfully, why didn\u2019t the president notify speaker of the House?\u201d\n\nPence said, \u201cI just want to emphasize the president\u2019s focus here throughout particularly the last several days was on the mission to bring a man who was the most wanted man in the world, a man who had brought unspeakable violence through the isis caliphate, who was exporting violence throughout the world to justice and that combined with ensuring the safety of our forces coming in from executing the mission and moving out was the president\u2019s directive throughout this effort and I know it animated every decision that he made along the way. \u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of \"Fox News Sunday,\" host Chris Wallace pressed Vice President Mike Pence on why President Donald Trump did not notify\u00a0House | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/chris-wallace-gesture-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
