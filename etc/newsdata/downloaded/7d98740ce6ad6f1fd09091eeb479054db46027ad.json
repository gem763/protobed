The website lists positive testimonials from representatives of the UNSW Engineering Society, Medical Society, and Education Society, among others.\n\nThe Reddit user said this potential breach is concerning, as \u201csocieties sometimes help members with sensitive topics,\u201d adding \u201cname, date of birth and mobile are enough for a wealth of social engineering hacks\u201d.\n\nAs Qnect, the company was the target of a separate date breach in 2017, in which the platform was subjected to an attempted extortion attempt. Speaking to News.com.au last year, co-founder Daniel Liang said \u201cthe media did blow it up much more than it really was.\u201d\n\nGet yesterday assured users it was safe to use, and that events and e-commerce activities hosted on Get will continue to operate.\n\nREAD MORE Robert Downey Jr Had His Instagram Hacked For An iPhone Giveaway Scam", "description": "Get, used by university clubs, says it is investigating claims of a worrying data breach.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/unsw-get-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
