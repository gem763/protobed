Replacement Trevor Siemian wasn\u2019t good and then he was knocked out with an ugly looking ankle injury. Third-string quarterback Luke Falk didn\u2019t impress in his NFL debut. And Adam Gase isn\u2019t good enough of a coach to fix this mess.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Jets are 0-2 and it\u2019s hard to see it getting much better. There are 14 games still to play.\n\nNew York Jets quarterback Trevor Siemian grabs his leg after being hurt against the Browns. (AP)\n\nJets offense was stuck vs. Browns\n\nThe Jets had minus-13 net passing yards in the first half. If you were fortunate enough to have not watched on Monday night, it was just as ugly as you\u2019d imagine.\n\nSiemian was content to check every pass down before Myles Garrett landed on him and his leg bent in a bad way. Siemian came out and Falk came in for his first NFL snaps.\n\nThe Jets offense was uncreative and conservative with Darnold in Week 1, and that\u2019s becoming a Gase calling card. It wasn\u2019t better in Week 2. For a supposed offensive guru, his offenses in Miami and now New York haven\u2019t been very good.\n\nGase also made a bad game management mistake at the end of the first half. The Jets were backed up at their own 12-yard line. They threw a second-down pass that was incomplete and stopped the clock. The Jets then ran on third down, let the Browns call their final timeout, and Cleveland had a short drive for a field goal on the last play of the half. Instead of just running out the half, Gase gave the Browns three free points.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt probably didn\u2019t matter because the Jets weren\u2019t going to score much anyway, but it\u2019s the kind of mistake that doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in the Jets\u2019 new head coach.\n\nJets off to bad 0-2 start\n\nEven if Siemian\u2019s injury isn\u2019t as bad as it looked, nothing he did Monday night should excite anyone. Falk completed some passes (he finished 20-of-25 for 198 yards) but didn\u2019t get the Jets in the end zone.\n\nTeams can have their seasons turn fast. In Week 1, the Jets had a 16-0 lead on the Buffalo Bills. They blew that lead and lost. Then Darnold was ruled out for Week 2 and he might be out a while. By the end of Monday night\u2019s game, it was hard to muster up any encouraging words for Jets fans. There\u2019s a lot of the season to go and the Jets are already at a low point.\n\nThe Jets have to regroup because in Week 3 they play (checks notes) ... at the New England Patriots. Gulp.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at shutdown.corner@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
