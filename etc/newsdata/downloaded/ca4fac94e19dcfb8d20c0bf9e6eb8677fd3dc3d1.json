If Only We Could Trust It.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "Uber and Lyft say that classifying drivers as employees might threaten their business models and force them to let go of many of their drivers. The companies are calling for legislation or a ballot initiative under which drivers would remain independent contractors but still receive an array of labor rights, including a minimum pay and the ability to unionize. The companies argue that their proposal is not a mere compromise but a genuine advance in labor protections. By enshrining rights for independent contractors into state law, they would be preserving the flexibility that their drivers covet, while also advancing a new model for labor in the era of software-driven \u201cgig\u201d work.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know anything about Uber\u2019s past, you might be tempted to buy into the sunny proposal. Surveys show that many Uber and Lyft drivers only want to drive part time, between other jobs, and they are not enthusiastic about some of the strictures that might come with classification as employees. Adding protections and unionization to independent-contract work could well be a step forward for them.\n\nYet every time I find myself feeling optimistic about ways to accommodate and tame Uber\u2019s rise, I remember: Oh, yeah. This is Uber we\u2019re talking about. This is the company that barged into cities across the planet and operated an enormously consequential and dangerous service without anyone\u2019s consent. Then, when challenged by authorities, the company\u2019s entire M.O. was to fight hard and fight dirty. Wouldn\u2019t we be fools to trust it now?\n\nAs \u201cSuper Pumped\u201d documents in hair-raising detail, Uber\u2019s growth was fueled by military-grade black-ops programs to thwart law enforcement, competitors and the press. It treated any skepticism, and even the very notion of corporate ethics, as a challenge to be fought to the death. Uber\u2019s recklessness is sometimes seen as an aberration \u2014 the fault of one bad apple, Travis Kalanick, the company\u2019s take-no-prisoners founder. But for much of Uber\u2019s rise, its culture was also encouraged and celebrated by investors, employees and much of the tech industry \u2014 the worse the company behaved, the more strongly it came to believe that it was actually \u201ccrushing it,\u201d in Mr. Kalanick\u2019s bro-ese, and the more it was showered with fresh rounds of investment to crush it some more.\n\nThe entire saga begs for stringent oversight of Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up engine, but that\u2019s not a lesson anyone seems to have learned. \u201cEveryone involved from the beginning is now filthy rich,\u201d Mike Isaac told me last week. \u201cThey have not suffered any ostracism in the Valley. Travis is still investing in companies. He\u2019s still going to the Met Gala. He\u2019s not been cast out of well-to-do society.\u201d", "description": "The company\u2019s drivers deserve to be classified as full-fledged employees.", "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/opinion/04manjooWeb/04manjooWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
