Or am I a credulous dolt for even suggesting redemption for one of the sorriest companies ever to emerge from Silicon Valley\u2019s tortured hothouse?\n\nThose are some of the questions dancing around my head after reading \u201cSuper Pumped,\u201d the Times reporter Mike Isaac\u2019s banger of a new book documenting Uber\u2019s stunningly reckless rise. (Disclosure: Mike is not just a colleague but also a close and longtime frenemy.)\n\nThe book, which goes into forensic detail about the ride-hailing company\u2019s lawless history, arrives at an especially inopportune time for Uber. The company has reported a string of gargantuan losses since its stock went public in May. Now things are getting worse. In California, Uber and its primary rival, Lyft, are facing an existential battle over the legal status of their drivers. State lawmakers are poised to pass a bill that would allow ride-hailing drivers to be recognized as full-fledged employees; drivers are currently classified as independent contractors, which means they pay their own expenses, receive no labor protections and can work for sub-minimum wage pay.\n\n[Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]\n\nUber and Lyft say that classifying drivers as employees might threaten their business models and force them to let go of many of their drivers. The companies are calling for legislation or a ballot initiative under which drivers would remain independent contractors but still receive an array of labor rights, including a minimum pay and the ability to unionize. The companies argue that their proposal is not a mere compromise but a genuine advance in labor protections. By enshrining rights for independent contractors into state law, they would be preserving the flexibility that their drivers covet, while also advancing a new model for labor in the era of software-driven \u201cgig\u201d work.", "description": "The company\u2019s drivers deserve to be classified as full-fledged employees.", "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/opinion/04manjooWeb/04manjooWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
