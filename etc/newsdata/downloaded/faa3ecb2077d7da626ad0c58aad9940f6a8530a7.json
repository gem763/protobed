In strong markets, everyone is trying to stay with their winners but in poor markets, there are many other complex considerations.\n\nPoor action always produces some 'buying opportunity' calls but typically those calls come from folks that are already heavily long. Those that have been more active in trying to time the action are usually not quite as active to dive into a waterfall selloff.\n\nObviously trend followers need to step out of the way or look for shorts if they believe that a correction is now here. While I tend to be a trend follower in strong markets, I am inclined to focus more on counter-trend bounces in weak markets. The biggest bounces always occur in the worst markets and I find that strategy tends to work well for my style which is to focus on individual stock picking more than movement in the indices.\n\nIt is inevitable that this extreme selling will eventually produce a bounce but the timing is extremely tricky. I have found that rather than try to predict the moment that a stock hits its exact low, I try to focus on when it has the best chance of producing a sustained move. It usually requires some upticks before other buyers will feel comfortable and jump in.\n\nWhen you buy into the teeth of a decline, there isn't any obvious support level. If you wait for some sort of positive action first then the recent lows become a very obvious strategic level that allows for some planning.\n\nAn example of a stock that I'm looking at is Ocular Therapeutix (OCUL) . It has been pounded lately on no obvious news. The biotech sector has been very week but additionally, there is recent SEC filings showing that the Sackler family has a near 20% position in the stock through a hedge fund. That fund was subpoenaed as part of an investigation into the family's movement of cash. That seems to be creating some additional selling pressure.\n\nThe stock finally started to bounce today and I took shares with an eye on the $3 level of support.\n\nIt is poor markets that offer good traders the best opportunities. It is action like this that allows for substantial outperform. Identify your style and approach and go to work.", "description": "I am inclined to focus more on counter-trend bounces in weak markets....OCUL", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Buying Into The Teeth Of A Decline", "I Am Inclined To Focus More On Counter-Trend Bounces In Weak Markets.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Bruce Kamich", "Bob Lang", "Paul Price", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/edb01efa-9ede-11e7-acbf-a7e0be559373.png"}
