REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany\n\nAbdel Rehim Saeid, 35, applies the ancient Pharaonic technique, known as the \u201cfiery towel\u201d by starting with a standard massage, using oil and camomile, to stimulate blood circulation and alleviate some of the pain in affected areas.\n\nThen comes the heat.\n\nSaeid places several layers of towels and other isolating materials on the client\u2019s back. Then a towel soaked in alcohol is placed on top and set on fire. It burns for roughly a minute before the flames are put out with a wet towel.\n\n\u201cIt is ...called a fiery massage,\u201d Saeid said, that works by sucking moisture out of the body.\n\n\u201cI communicate with the human body, coming into close contact with the body of the human in front of me,\u201d he said.\n\nSaeid said he cannot use the technique with people suffering from high blood pressure, kidney failure or haemophilia.\n\nHe said he trained under an expert in the fiery towel technique in Morocco, and had earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt.\n\nMohammed al-Shaer, a client in his 30s, said his pain had improved \u201c100%\u201d after the fiery treatment.\n\n\u201cBefore, I could not stand to pray. I couldn\u2019t stretch my back when I got out of a car,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, after the second session, my body is getting better and my movement is better. I used to be very lazy but this is no longer the case.\u201d", "description": "An Egyptian masseur plays with fire to relieve his clients' muscle pain at his spa in the Nile Delta governorate of Gharbeya.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429073359&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B13S-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
