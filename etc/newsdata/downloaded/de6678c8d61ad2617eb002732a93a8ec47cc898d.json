United (12-10-9, 45 points) are fifth in the Eastern Conference entering Sunday.\n\nThe Black and Red will make their final playoff push with Wayne Rooney. Rooney will leave the club after this year to join Derby County in England as a player and assistant coach.\n\nLast year, Rooney\u2019s arrival helped turn the team around from bottom-feeder to playoff qualifier, but United lost in the knockout round.\n\nThere are three games left in the regular season, starting Sunday night when United host the Seattle Sounders.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
