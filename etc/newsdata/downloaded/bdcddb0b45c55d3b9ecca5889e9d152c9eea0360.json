Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in pointedly excluding Trump:\n\nA ruthless murderer has been brought to justice. I\u2019m grateful to our military and intelligence community. Their courage and dedication inspire us all. Abandoning our Syrian and Kurdish partners remains a disastrous decision that will make the fight against ISIS harder. \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 27, 2019\n\nI congratulate our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice to the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The world is better and safer without him in it. pic.twitter.com/miLSVWBT9l \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 27, 2019\n\nAbu Bakr al Baghdadi was a murderer and terrorist responsible for terrible suffering and death. The fight against ISIS would not be possible without the brave efforts of the Kurds and other U.S. allies. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) October 27, 2019\n\nBoth Biden and Castro used their statements to criticize President Trump\u2019s recent decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Turkey-Syria border, and from Syria more generally. Castro\u2019s language was even more passive.\n\nOther candidates were slow to acknowledge the successful raid, in which no American soldiers were killed or injured, aside from a K-9 dog involved in the operation.\n\nTrump told reporters that he had excluded certain congressional leaders from being briefed in advance of the raid for fear that leaks in Washington might tip off the terrorists, endanger U.S. forces, and undermine the success of the operation.\n\nJoel B.
