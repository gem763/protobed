Three kisses. Love heart emoji. Send.\n\nI won\u2019t beat around the bush here: The Circle is the best thing on the box right now, and the best reality competition show for a very, very long time.\n\nI used to be fanatical about this genre of telly. It was so intense in the noughties that when my class did a one-off school newspaper in 2004 and other pupils were covering serious community issues, my friend and I put together a 12-page supplement on Big Brother 5.\n\nBut as time has marched on, reality TV as I knew it has been running out of gas; becoming more and more sensational, convoluted and soulless. Aside from occasional gems like Race Across The World and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, my enthusiasm for it has sharply dropped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut The Circle? Oh, The Circle has changed everything. The Circle is everything.\n\nDavina with winner of Big Brother 5 Nadia Almada (Picture: J. Quinton/WireImage)\n\nYes, I am \u2013 and I cannot stress this enough \u2013 absolutely obsessed. You know that bit in Mean Girls when Cady\u2019s like, \u2018I spent about 80 per cent of my time talking about Regina, and the other 20 per cent of the time I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more\u2019? That\u2019s me with The Circle. \u2018I could hear people getting bored with me, but I couldn\u2019t stop!\u2019\n\nAt its core, the format is reassuringly familiar to anyone whose Friday nights once revolved around the words \u2018this is Davina\u2019. Strangers move in under one roof, are cut-off completely from the outside world, and endure numerous popularity-based evictions en-route to a big cash prize. So far, so standard.\n\nBut there\u2019s a twist. Though they\u2019re technically all living in the same building, on this show the players never meet face to face. Instead, they\u2019re confined to separate apartments, and communicate with one-another via a purpose-built, voice-activated app called The Circle.\n\nWhat this means \u2013 and where the show becomes particularly relevant to the social media age \u2013 is that contestants can essentially present whatever version of themselves they want\u2026 if they even want to play as themselves at all.\n\nTim, Katie and Woody (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nWhile many keep things simple and don\u2019t change a thing (eccentric Santa look-a-like Tim, so-called \u2018geezer bird\u2019 Ella, 21-year-old firecracker Georgina), others tweak or conceal certain parts of their identity, and others play as completely different characters altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, 18-year-old Woody is seeing how far he can get without revealing his parents are Zoe Ball and Norman \u2018Fatboy Slim\u2019 Cook, while recruitment consultant James is playing a blinder as he pretends to be a young single mother called Sammie.\n\nElsewhere, 31-year-old Paddy held off on telling the other players that he has cerebral palsy, wanting them to get to know him for his personality first \u2013 something that rarely happens in his day-to-day life. And providing some of the show\u2019s funniest moments, 43-year-old Katie helplessly tried to convince everyone she was her own alpha-lad builder son, Jay.\n\nIt\u2019s utterly, utterly engrossing. And what it all boils down to is the fact that, like all good reality TV, it achieves the perfect blend of scream-at-the-telly drama, laugh-out-loud humour, and emotive warmth.\n\nPaddy held off telling other contestants he has cerebral palsy (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nWhen catfish Katie (as \u2018Jay\u2019) obliviously fuelled others\u2019 suspicions with her try-hard hashtags and acronyms, we laughed. When Paddy finally told everyone about his condition, we cried. When Jack and Beth finally kissed after a twist resulted in them playing together as one character, we\u2026 well, we weren\u2019t particularly fussed in all honesty, but good for them.\n\nThere are payoffs to all the suspicions and deceptions, too. When players get the chop, they can pop in to visit someone else on their way out; and when \u2018Jay\u2019 knocked on the door of fellow catfish \u2018Sammie\u2019, it was one of the most gasp-inducing scenes of any show this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely when best pals Brooke and Georgina met after the former\u2019s elimination, the screams of euphoria when they realised they were both \u2018real\u2019 were surprisingly moving.\n\nBut an extra string to The Circle\u2019s bow, and perhaps my favourite thing about it, is the fact that we can watch and dissect what happens when people lie about themselves online.\n\nWith ruthless 'Sammie' in power as an Influencer, could this be a brutal blocking?! The revolution will be televised on @Channel4 at 10pm. #TheCircle pic.twitter.com/6Yzxr7e8XQ \u2014 The Circle (@C4TheCircle) October 16, 2019\n\nWhen does it make them popular, and when does it not? When does their success or failure say something interesting about society, and when does it just come down to how much effort someone did or didn\u2019t put into a fake backstory?\n\nEmelle, for example, kept her real name and face but aged herself down and hid her sexuality; (worryingly!) assuming she would stand a better chance if the other players thought she was younger and heterosexual.\n\nBut instead she was the first to be eliminated when they complained that they didn\u2019t know her well enough. Would she have progressed further if she had unabashedly been herself, rather than a half-baked version? Maybe so.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, James-as-Sammie shot to the top of the popularity rankings in the early episodes when he realised a gorgeous single mother with a cute baby in her profile picture would easily win others\u2019 affections.\n\nJames is playing Sammie, a single mum (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nBut after failing to generate much attention beyond that initial \u2018aw\u2019, his status slipped. It wasn\u2019t until he started having more fun, letting his own sense of humour shine through via \u2018Sammie\u2019, that he returned to the forefront of the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, with the final in sight, he\u2019s gone all-out ruthless. While he\u2019s loved by some viewers and hated by others, he\u2019s certainly not made the mistakes of \u2018Josh\u2019 (Busayo), \u2018Joyce\u2019 (Jack and Beth), \u2018Jay\u2019 (Katie) and even Emelle by fading into the background with bland or ropey characters.\n\nClearly, The Circle has given its hooked fans so, so much to talk about in such a short space of time; and with only a few days left, there\u2019s so much more to come.\n\nWhoever wins on Friday (I genuinely can\u2019t pick a favourite), I truly hope it\u2019s back for a third season in 2020 \u2013 with the giant ratings it deserves.\n\nBecause honestly, with the addictive appeal of Love Island, the drama of Game Of Thrones and the simplicity of a new and updated Big Brother, it really should be sweeping the nation.\n\nMORE: The Circle recap: Busayo reveals true self to Ella as catfish \u2018Josh\u2019 is blocked from the game\n\nMORE: When is the final of The Circle?\n\nMORE: The Circle\u2019s Woody finally comes clean about his dad being Fatboy Slim and reaction is priceless", "description": "With the final of The Circle 2019 approaching, Shaun Kitchener explains why it is the best show on TV.", "authors": ["Shaun Kitchener", "Screenwriter", "Playwright", "Entertainment Journalist"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRI_86742552_1571222946.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
