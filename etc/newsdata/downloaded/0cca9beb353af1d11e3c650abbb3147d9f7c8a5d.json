The 61-year-old gripped a gun as he stepped outside his home in Gulf Breeze, Fla. When he saw a person jump out of the bushes, he pulled the trigger.\n\nOnly then did Dennis realize who the person was: his son-in-law.\n\nChristopher Bergan had flown 4,500 miles from Norway, where he and his wife live, to get to the Florida Panhandle. It was supposed to be a birthday surprise for Dennis, who was turning 62 the next day. Instead, it was a tragedy: The bullet hit Bergan \u201cstraight in the heart,\u201d Santa Rosa County Sheriff Bob Johnson said, killing the 37-year-old instantly.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Nation Man-Jumped-Bushes-Birthday-Surprise-His-Startled-Father-In-Law-Fatally-Shot-Him"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
