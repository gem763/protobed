The FTC alleges that Sunday Riley managers encouraged other employees to create fake accounts and do the same. The practice was revealed when an anonymous Reddit user leaked company emails in October 2018.\n\nThe settlement \u2014 to which two FTC commissioners dissented \u2014 is intended to ensure the brand's employees \"do not engage in similar allegedly illegal conduct in the future.\" Still, Sunday Riley will not be required to make any payments to the FTC or notify customers of its wrongdoings.\n\nSunday Riley will have to follow some new rules following its settlement with the Federal Trade Commission\n\nThe FTC previously filed a complaint against Sunday Riley, saying the company made two major violations of the FTC Act: writing reviews that mislead customers to believe they were written by \"ordinary users of the products,\" and \"failing to disclose\" the reviews were written by the brand's founder and employees.\n\nThe new settlement is meant to ensure Riley and her employees \"do not engage in similar allegedly illegal conduct in the future.\" To do so, the brand and its employees can no longer misrepresent \"the status of any endorser or person\" who reviews its products.\n\nSunday Riley will also be required teach employees \"to clearly and conspicuously disclose their connections\" to the company when endorsing any of its products, according to the FTC.\n\nSunday Riley is the CEO of her eponymous brand.

The Redditor, who said they were a former employee of the skin-care brand, alleged that \"a lot of the really great reviews you read are fake.\"\n\nEmployees were instructed by management to write at least three fake reviews each, according to the Redditor, and were also given detailed instructions on how to describe products in reviews. The Sunday Riley brand then confirmed the allegations on Reddit and Instagram.\n\n\"At one point, we did encourage people to post positive reviews at the launch of this product, consistent with their experiences,\" a brand representative previously said. \"There are a lot of reasons for doing that, including the fact that competitors will often post negative reviews of products to swing opinion.\"\n\nRead more: Skin-care brand Sunday Riley asked employees to write glowing Sephora reviews to persuade people to buy their products\n\nSunday Riley, the brand's eponymous founder, also has a murky background\n\nIn brand advertisements and interviews, the Sunday Riley founder regularly refers to herself as a \"formulator\" and a \"cosmetic chemist.\" Various media outlets have also reported that she is a cosmetic chemist.
