The vehicle is the follow-up to a shorter and stubbier prototype called Starhopper.\n\nPhotos and videos show the new rocket ship's final assembly. \"Starship will allow us to inhabit other worlds,\" company founder Elon Musk tweeted after the vehicle was mated.\n\nMusk is due to provide an update on the company's Starship program on Saturday around 8 p.m. ET from Boca Chica, Texas.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nA day before Elon Musk is due to present the latest progress on Starship \u2014 an enormous and fully reusable Mars launch system \u2014 the tech mogul's rocket company, SpaceX, has finished a gleaming prototype.\n\nSpaceX built the new shiny stainless-steel test vehicle, called Starship Mk 1, at its launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, amid a sleepy hamlet of about two dozen residents.\n\nWorkers for the company first attached two large wings to the lower half of Starship Mk 1 in the middle of the week. They then worked through the night on Friday to add canards (or wings) to the upper section.\n\nOver the course of an hour on Friday afternoon, they lifted the upper section with a huge construction crane, moved it over the lower section, and carefully dropped it into place. The YouTube user LabPadre, who lives in South Texas, recorded the process and shared a sped-up video:\n\nRachel and Gene Gore, who run the website SPadre.com (a reference to nearby South Padre Island), also live in the area and were on the scene to record the mating of Starship Mk 1 from a different angle.\n\nOne of their photos shows workers beginning to fix the two sections into place on the end of telescoping booms:\n\nSpaceX's Starship Mk 1 prototype. Rachel Gore/SPadre.com\n\nMusk said the Starship Mk 1 prototype is about 164 feet tall and weighs about 200 tons without any fuel, which is about as heavy as a blue whale.\n\nOnce filled with liquid methane and oxygen at the launch pad, though, it may weigh seven times that amount. A full-scale and operational Starship system may stand 39 to 40 stories tall once stacked atop a gigantic rocket booster dubbed Super Heavy.\n\n\"Starship will allow us to inhabit other worlds,\" Musk tweeted on Friday after sharing the photo below, later adding: \"To make life as we know it multiplanetary.\"\n\nSpaceX's Starship Mk 1 is 164 feet tall. Elon Musk/SpaceX; Twitter\n\nMusk will present new updates about SpaceX's Starship system on Saturday\n\nStarship Mk 1 is not built to fly to Mars. Rather, it's an early test vehicle to try out new technologies that will lead to a full-scale Mars ship.\n\nIts construction follows an earlier 60-foot-tall prototype, called Starhopper, that flew to 500 feet and landed on a nearby concrete pad in August.\n\nThe latest prototype does have three car-sized Raptor rocket engines attached its base, though, which Musk hopes will propel the craft to more than 12 miles high before the end of this year. A follow-on launch may send the crude steel-paneled rocket ship around Earth.\n\nMusk is due to present the latest news about the rocket company's plans for Starship on Saturday around 8 p.m. ET from its southernmost launch site.\n\nSpaceX has yet to confirm if there will be a livestream, but the company typically broadcasts from its YouTube channel just before each of Musk's major announcements.\n\nRead more: Elon Musk is about to unveil SpaceX's new Mars spaceship prototype in Texas", "description": "SpaceX's new Starship Mk 1 rocket ship is part of a larger effort to create a launch system that'd take dozens of people to Mars at a time.", "authors": ["Dave Mosher"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e72162e22af7b0f1f2554?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
