I was just focusing on the [Telstar] match because it was a big game and we needed the three points so I forgot about the other stuff going on.\n\n\u2018The aim is to finish the season, a strong season, and hopefully get as high as possible with the team and push for the next level.\n\n\u2018Chelsea came out to the last game to watch me and see how I\u2019m doing. They are really happy with me out here scoring goals and getting back to what I\u2019m good at.\u2019", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY ADRIAN KAJUMBA: Nigeria have been running the rule over 21 year-old hotshot Ugbo who has caught the eye after making a prolific start to his loan spell at Roda JC this season.", "authors": ["Adrian Kajumba For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19391028-0-image-a-69_1570445386982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
