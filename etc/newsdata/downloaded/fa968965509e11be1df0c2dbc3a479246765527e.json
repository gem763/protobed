Images of the president greeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as \u201cmy friend\u201d in a last-minute meetup streamed across televisions worldwide.\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t alone. After a few snapshots, Ivanka Trump, along with her husband, Jared Kushner, followed the president into what\u2019s known as the Freedom House\u2014a building on the South Korean side of the zone. That\u2019s when the cameras stopped. The media was reportedly blocked from entering and covering the historic event.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that reporters learned Ivanka and Kushner did more than accompany the president into the Freedom House. They were reportedly present at a closed-door meeting between the two leaders, who ended up speaking about one of the most sensitive topics on the planet\u2014North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapons program.\n\n\u201c She matters because the president says she matters. Who in their right mind would cross her knowing that? \u201d \u2014 former administration official\n\n(The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After this story was published, an official reached out and said: \u201cAlthough they met Kim, Jared and Ivanka did not participate in the closed-door meeting.\u201d The official did not clarify which meeting Ivanka and Jared participated in or how many meetings were held on the border. But two other officials told The Daily Beast that Ivanka and Kushner were in the room for part of the conversations that pertained to nuclear weapons and sanctions.\n\nPresident Trump has long used his family, particularly his son-in-law, to run various foreign-policy projects, leading to investigations on Capitol Hill over security clearances and the administration\u2019s circumvention of traditional foreign-policy procedure. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a recent congressional interview that he was often left in the dark about various high-stakes foreign-policy decisions because Kushner at times ran his own shadow State Department, meeting secretly with world leaders from countries such as Mexico and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe meeting in the DMZ seemed to spur a new sense of frustration in Washington on Monday, this time directed in particular at the first daughter, who was also present\u2014front and center\u2014at the G-20 summit in Hamburg. She provided a video readout about the conversations Trump had with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and took photo-ops with attendees.\n\n\u201cIvanka has participated in previous bilateral meetings, and on behalf of the White House at past G-20 summits,\u201d said Garrett Marquis, a spokesperson for the National Security Council. \u201cIssues of women\u2019s empowerment are central to the president\u2019s national-security and women\u2019s peace and security strategies.\u201d\n\nPhotos and video footage from the conference emerged over the weekend, showing Ivanka mingling with some of the top world leaders, inserting herself into conversations with veterans of the foreign-policy world. The internet erupted, and lawmakers took to social media.\n\n\u201cIt may be shocking to some, but being someone\u2019s daughter actually isn\u2019t a career qualification,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said on Twitter. \u201cIt hurts our diplomatic standing when the President phones it in & the world moves on.\u201d\n\nOne senior administration official told The Daily Beast that the Trump team often tries to find roles for Ivanka on travels overseas because she is a talented spokesperson. But it is unclear what Ivanka was doing in North Korea beyond the purely ceremonial. Two senior administration officials and one former one said they do not consider the president\u2019s daughter a significant player on major foreign-policy initiatives, including on the Koreas, though they all acknowledged that President Trump will at least solicit her advice for gut checks on any manner of foreign-policy and national-security decision: striking other countries, climate agreements, and so on.\n\n\u201cShe matters because the president says she matters,\u201d the former official said. \u201cWho in their right mind would cross her knowing that?\u201d\n\nA current official noted that Ivanka is often in the room during important policy discussions and read-into those matters specifically, and at times exclusively, because her father demanded it.\n\nIt\u2019s not only Trump\u2019s aides and advisers who have taken note of that; foreign leaders have factored it into their diplomacy and flattery of Trump, as well. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is known to go out of his way to ask the president how Ivanka is doing and ask about her interest in global women\u2019s empowerment projects, another one of the current senior Trump administration officials said.\n\nStill, Ivanka\u2019s protected status in the Trump orbit has frustrated several high-ranking aides over the years, including the president\u2019s one-time chief strategist Steve Bannon and former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, the latter of whom reportedly complained in private that Ivanka is merely \u201cplaying government,\u201d according to a CNN report early last year.\n\nThat report came at a time when Ivanka\u2019s trip to South Korea, as leader of a U.S. delegation at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics, perplexed, if not outright aggravated, several of her fellow senior colleagues, chief among them Kelly, a former White House official said.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have looked into how and why the administration\u2019s foreign policy has shifted at the hands of Trump\u2019s family. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, in particular, has scrutinized Kushner\u2019s relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Tillerson, in his interview with the committee in May, said the inclusion of Ivanka and Kushner in the national-security process made his job more difficult.\n\n\u201cOne of the challenges I think that everyone had\u2026 to learn to deal with was the role, the unique situation with the president\u2019s son-in-law [Kushner] and daughter [Ivanka] being part of the White House advisory team,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cThere was not a real clear understanding of the role, responsibilities, authorities\u2026 which made it challenging for everyone.\u201d", "description": "Multiple officials in Washington were caught off guard by the news that Ivanka Trump had found her way into a conversation with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "National Security Reporter", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1562030086/190701-banco-ivanka-tease_1_wukj8b", "published_at": "2019-07-02"}
