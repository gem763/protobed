There remains intrigue, though, because the Badgers stack up as the best opponent Ohio State (7-0, 4-0) has faced so far. Wisconsin and Ohio State are the top two defenses in the country, and five of the last six meetings have been decided by seven points or less. That makes it hard to imagine the Buckeyes continuing their streak of winning all their games by no fewer than 24 points. The Buckeyes have won 30 of their last 31 home games against Big Ten opponents, the only loss coming to Michigan State in 2015.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nMichigan front seven vs. Notre Dame offensive line\n\nThe Wolverines bring an aggressive pass rush and have 23 sacks in seven games, and they\u2019re allowing just 3.03 yards per rush. Notre Dame\u2019s line is doing a good job protecting Ian Book, giving up no sacks against Georgia, one against Southern California and a total of nine in six games. On top of that, the line is paving the way to 5.3 yards per carry.\n\nFACTS AND FIGURES\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Jonathan Taylor needs 43 yards to become the fourth player in program history to record three straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons. \u2026 Iowa (at Northwestern) is allowing 11.6 points per game, the fewest since 1965. The Hawkeyes\u2019 275-yard defensive average is the lowest since 1984. \u2026 Northwestern has nine scrimmage plays of 20 yards or longer, fewest in the nation and six behind the team with the second fewest (Army). \u2026 . Minnesota (vs. Maryland) is 4-0 in the Big Ten for the first time since 1967 and last started 5-0 in 1961. \u2026 Maryland opponents have converted just 1 of 10 fourth downs. \u2026 Penn State (vs. Michigan State) is allowing an FBS-low 1.9 yards per rush. \u2026 Michigan State is playing a third straight top-10 opponent. \u2026 Rutgers (vs. Liberty) has had two four-game spans over the last four seasons in which it scored only 14 points. That\u2019s nothing compared to the 1936 team, which was held to seven points over its final seven games.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nIllinois, 8-point underdog at Purdue\n\nThe Illini (3-4, ,1-3) are riding high after beating Wisconsin in the biggest upset of the season. Coach Lovie Smith has talked about the importance of \u201cstacking wins\u201d if his program is to move forward. This is an opportunity for Illinois to beat back-to-back Big Ten opponents for the first time since Tim Beckman\u2019s 2014 team did. Purdue has won three straight in the series and 11 of 14.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nIndiana RB Stevie Scott III\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 231-pound sophomore has gone over 100 yards in two straight games and will be going against a Nebraska rushing defense that ranks 13th in the Big Ten in conference games. He\u2019s fifth in the Big Ten in rushing (79 ypg) and second among conference backs with 18 catches.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Here's what to watch in the Big Ten this week:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/ohio_st_northwestern_football_63258_c0-176-4215-2634_s1200x700.jpg?17676251bdc3da7c5bdbaf1040224ef99cf5df7b", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
