The Giants beat the Rockies 3-2 in 18 innings and 5:35 on April 12 - the longest game at Oracle Park since an 18-inning loss to Arizona on May 29, 2001. Colorado also played two games of 16 innings or more in 2006.\n\nSam Howard (2-0) pitched the final two innings for the win.\n\nWith the Cardinals and Diamondbacks also going long, it marked the first time since June 8, 2013 - Mets-Marlins and Blue Jays-Rangers - more than one game went at least 15 innings the same day, according to MLB Stats.\n\nEvan Longoria hit a tying homer in the eighth off Carlos Estevez. Longoria became the third Giants player with 20 homers, and for much of the game the ball carried on an unseasonably warm late-September night. First-pitch temperature was 78 degrees.\n\nGarrett Hampson hit his second homer of the game to put Colorado ahead in the eighth after losing starter Jeff Hoffman to a knee injury from a line drive, but the Giants kept pushing.\n\nTrevor Story connected for his 34th homer after a pair of strikeouts to begin his night against Madison Bumgarner, who might have made his final start for San Francisco, though he was still scheduled to pitch Sunday\u2019s season finale. Bochy hinted there still could be a change.\n\nBumgarner drew big cheers as he walked to the mound to start the game, then struck out nine and walked two over seven innings, allowing four runs on six hits.\n\nHoffman took a line drive off his right knee in the fourth inning and was carted off the field. Alex Dickerson\u2019s sharp single hit squarely on Hoffman\u2019s knee and the pitcher went down writhing in pain, and the ball ricocheted toward San Francisco\u2019s dugout. He was down a little more than five minutes as athletic trainers from both teams tended to him on the mound.\n\nBuster Posey hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the first for just his seventh home run and first in 123 at-bats since July 31 at Philadelphia. Bumgarner added a homer of his own but the lefty remains winless in five starts since beating the Padres on Aug. 30. The Giants have lost his last four outings.\n\nIan Desmond hit a two-run homer in the fourth after Bumgarner hit Blackmon on the left hand area with a pitch to start the inning.\n\nBochy began what he knows will be an emotional final week on the dugout\u2019s top step. Fans stood and cheered when his picture showed on the big scoreboard during pregame introductions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to say bye,\u201d Bochy said.\n\nBumgarner is slated to start again on the season\u2019s final day at home against the NL West champion Dodgers. Yet Bochy said before the game he didn\u2019t want the 2014 World Series MVP to feel obligated to start the manager\u2019s send-off game - though Bochy also would like this last week to finish on a winning, positive note for everybody involved.\n\nSTORY\u2019S MARK\n\nStory homered against the Giants for a franchise-record sixth straight game and became the first Colorado player to do so against any opponent over six matchups in a row. Mike Schmidt (1979) and Rogers Hornsby (1922) each homered in five consecutive games vs. the Giants. Andres Galarraga homered in five straight vs. St. Louis in 1996.\n\nTORRE\u2019S VISIT\n\nJoe Torre, now Major League Baseball\u2019s executive vice president of baseball operations, turned up before the game to offer his best wishes to Bochy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a special individual,\u201d Torre said after greeting the manager on the field.\n\nA video tribute from Torre played on the big screen before the fourth inning and Torre said, \u201cYou\u2019re a class act and I admire how you go about your business.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nGiants: Bochy was unsure whether RHP Johnny Cueto will make another start this season. Cueto (1-1) has made three starts spanning 14 innings since returning from a 13-month absence recovering from Tommy John surgery. His next turn would be Friday in the series opener vs. Los Angeles.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Tim Melville (2-3, 5.40 ERA) makes his seventh start of the year and the first of his career against the Giants having gone 2-0 with a 2.13 ERA in two road starts, beating NL West opponents Arizona and San Diego. RHP Jeff Samardzija (11-12, 3.64) has won two of his last three starts vs. Colorado and tries to match his career high of 12 wins accomplished in 2016 during his first year with San Francisco.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Rockies and Giants combined to use a major league-record 25 pitchers, and Colorado finished off San Francisco 8-5 early Wednesday morning when Charlie Blackmon hit a three-run homer in the 16th inning.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/rockies_giants_baseball_80807_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
