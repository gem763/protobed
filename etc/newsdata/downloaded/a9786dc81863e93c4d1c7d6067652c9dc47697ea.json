GM -1.05% are being forced to idle plants and lay off workers, as the national strike called by the United Auto Workers completes its fourth day.\n\nNearly 46,000 full-time GM workers walked off the job on Monday after the UAW and GM were unable to agree on a new four-year labor agreement before the previous one expired. As of Thursday afternoon, talks were continuing between the company and the union, but the stoppage was likely to enter a fifth day. The strike is now the longest nationwide strike against GM since the 1970s.\n\nBy stopping all production at GM\u2019s U.S. plants, the strike is also beginning to affect the web of manufacturers that produce parts that go into the company\u2019s cars. With no vehicles being made, those companies can do little but wait until the strike ends, industry experts say. Economists estimate that every automotive assembly job impacts between five and eight other jobs.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to last one day or six months, it\u2019s kind of hard to make decisions,\u201d said Sheldon Klein, who works with suppliers as the co-chair of the automotive practice at Butzel Long, a Detroit-area law firm. \u201cIt goes right to the bottom line for most suppliers.\u201d\n\nThe companies most affected so far are those that operate on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis, delivering difficult-to-ship parts like seats and door panels to GM\u2019s assembly plants from factories located nearby, said Michael Robinet, executive director of automotive advisory services at IHS Markit.\n\nSome of those plants have already laid off their workers temporarily or announced they are going to do so, as they reduce or idle production because of the continuing strike.\n\nAt least three companies around Lansing, Mich., have shut down their plants that supply the two GM assembly plants nearby, according to Todd Collins, who represents many of those plants\u2019 workers as the president of UAW Local 724. He estimated that around 75% of his local\u2019s roughly 1,800 members have been impacted by the strike.\n\nNexteer Automotive , which makes steering components and has a plant in Saginaw County, Mich., informed workers on Wednesday that it would be temporarily reducing its workforce on account of the GM strike, according to a company statement. Nexteer didn\u2019t provide specifics on which plants might be affected or how many staff might be laid off.\n\nAlready there are signs that the work stoppage is rippling beyond just those nearby plants and into the broader automotive supply chain. A typical finished vehicle is made from roughly 30,000 individual parts manufactured by hundreds of different companies, and companies that provide products to GM will themselves have networks of suppliers.\n\nStripmatic Products Inc., a Cleveland-based maker of suspension and chassis components, sells to other suppliers that provide products to GM for their pickup trucks and SUVs.\n\nThe GM Orion Assembly plant in Lake Orion, Mich., in March 2018.

GM hopes to tamp down its labor costs to better insulate itself from a potential slowdown in U.S. sales.\n\nThe strike is having cross-border implications as well. GM said Wednesday that it was temporarily laying off roughly 1,200 workers at an assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, on account of a shortage of necessary parts that would come from the company\u2019s U.S. plants.\n\nIn the U.S., given the importance of the automotive supply chain to the country\u2019s Midwest, a prolonged strike of more than a month could have serious implications for the region\u2019s economy, said Mark Zandi, principal economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of jobs in the industrial Midwest and likely would tip the region into a recession,\u201d Mr. Zandi said.\n\nWrite to Ben Foldy at Ben.Foldy@wsj.com", "description": "Companies that supply parts to General Motors Co. are being forced to idle plants and lay off workers, as the national strike called by the United Auto Workers completes its fourth day.", "authors": ["Ben Foldy", "Ben.Foldy Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108931/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
