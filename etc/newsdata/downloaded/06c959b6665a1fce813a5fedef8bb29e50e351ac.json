We\u2019re better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later.\u201d\n\nFacebook unveiled plans in June for Libra \u2014 which will roll out in 2020 \u2014 to be backed by a basket of currency assets to avoid the wild swings of Bitcoin and other virtual units.\n\nThe non-profit Libra Association, based in Geneva, will oversee the blockchain-based coin.\n\nFacebook envisions Libra as a new global cryptocurrency, pledging to deliver a stable virtual money that lives on smartphones and could bring over a billion \u201cunbanked\u201d people into the financial system.\n\n\u201cThe type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard,\u201d Disparte said.\n\n\u201cCommitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else.\u201d\n\nMastercard, Visa and other financial partners enlisted to oversee Libra are reportedly having second thoughts as regulators unleash ire on the project and dig for information from members of the association.\n\nOther Libra backers include ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber.\n\nThe head of the association said last week that the project\u2019s leaders aimed to \u201creassure\u201d regulators worried about the virtual money.\n\nIn leaked comments from a meeting of Facebook employees in July, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said he remained optimistic about Libra despite harsh comments from public officials in several countries.\n\n\u201cThe public things, I think, tend to be a little more dramatic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut a bigger part of it is private engagement with regulators around the world, and those, I think, often, are more substantive and less dramatic\u2026 That\u2019s where a lot of the discussions and details get hashed out on things.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Cook\u2019s view \u2013\n\nIn an interview published Friday in French newspaper Les Echos, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said he was uncomfortable with the idea of a company taking over roles typically reserved for governments.\n\nWithout specifically naming Facebook, Cook said issuing currency, like national defense, is best left to states.\n\nFacebook and some two dozen partners released a prototype of Libra as an open source code for developers interested in weaving it into apps, services or businesses.\n\nMartin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, questioned whether Libra would be able to fulfill its vision.\n\nIn particular, Libra will need to comply with regulations that require collecting personal information about customers in order to expose crimes such as money laundering or fraud.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear to me that Libra is anywhere near being able to perform those know-your-customer requirements that would allow them to legally serve these communities,\u201d Chorzempa said.\n\n\u201cLibra would have to work with governments to make sure they are compliant or get those rules changed, and that is a difficult process.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Pioneering digital payments firm PayPal said it is abandoning an alliance intended to oversee Facebook-backed Libra cryptocurrency.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paypal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
