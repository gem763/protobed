Even though Durant chose the Nets this past summer in free agency, Curry has expressed no hard feelings, saying in recent interviews that the pair's three years together in Golden State were \"special.\"\n\nDurant is sitting out for the entirety of the 2019-20 season recovering from an Achilles injury he suffered in last year's Finals while playing with the Warriors. Westbrook was shipped to the Houston Rockets this offseason after spending the entire first part of his career with the Thunder.", "description": "Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant, when asked which former MVP teammate he'd prefer, was quick to choose Stephen Curry over Russell Westbrook.", "authors": ["Scott Gleeson", "Published A.M.
