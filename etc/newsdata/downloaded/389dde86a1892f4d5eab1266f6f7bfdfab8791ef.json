Men are five times more likely than women to suffer the ailment after exercising.\n\nAnd my latest malady is, I\u2019ve learned, similarly common in men of my age.\n\nFLAT OUT: Michael having treatment after an ill-advised sprint ended in a torn hamstring\n\nTwo weeks ago, I tore a hamstring in my right leg. The hamstring muscles run up the back of the thigh, and are pretty important for walking, running, and doing anything that involves bending at the knee.\n\nI\u2019d been so pleased with the speedy recovery of my Achilles that I decided to take up running again, and went out exercising with a group of friends in Perth, Australia.\n\nBut I got carried away.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes of jogging and stretches, someone suggested we finish off with a few sprints.\n\nI should have bowed out gracefully, but being competitive, I decided to go for it.\n\nHalfway to the finishing line, I felt one of my hamstring muscles go \u2018pop\u2019. And then there was a surge of pain through my upper leg.\n\nI was driven back to a friend\u2019s house and followed a protocol recommended by exercise experts \u2013 see the panel, right for more details on this.\n\nThen, an Australian physiotherapist called Cassie, a friend of a friend, visited and offered some rather surprising advice.\n\nShe suggested that anti-inflammatory pain medication such as ibuprofen, which most of us turn to in these situations, was pretty useless.\n\nA few days ago, while I was out running through the woods, I tripped, tried to correct myself and \u2018bang\u2019 \u2013 I felt an intense, crippling pain in the back of my leg. I did wonder for a moment if I had been shot, or if someone had snuck up behind me with a hammer and given my calf a sharp whack\n\nInflammation, she said, is part of the healing process, particularly during the first 24 hours. Instead, she suggested I try something wildly different.\n\nCassie\u2019s recommendation was an type of therapy known as dry needling.\n\nIt involves inserting very thin needles into the area that you want to treat.\n\nAlthough it looks a bit like acupuncture, it isn\u2019t based on traditional Chinese medicine. Rather, it\u2019s based on the theory that after an injury, the muscles go into spasm in an attempt to protect the injured area.\n\nInserting a needle into a small knot of painful muscle supposedly relaxes it, and reduces pain.\n\nAustralian physiotherapists use it a lot to treat injuries to the hamstrings, back, neck, shoulders, hips and ankles.\n\nI was sceptical, but decided to give it a go.\n\nStrangely enough, the needles didn\u2019t hurt when they went in. I did feel a strange tingling travelling all the way down my leg, followed by significant pain relief.\n\nTo my surprise, the following day I was walking around quite comfortably.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF SOMETHING GOES 'POP' If you need a way to remember what to do immediately after an injury, think of the word \u2018RICE\u2019. The acronym relates to the four steps of treating an exercise-induced problem in the legs and feet. Sports scientists, coaches and athletes adhere to this guide \u2013 and if it\u2019s good enough for them, it\u2019s good enough for you\u2026 R est the injured limb by taking the weight off it.\n\nest the injured limb by taking the weight off it.

E levate the injured limb on a pillow or something similar, keeping it raised, ideally above the level of your heart.\n\nMy experience of dry needling was certainly positive, but I am just one person.\n\nSo what does science say?\n\nI discovered there\u2019s not a huge amount of research out there. But so far, the findings seem to be positive.\n\nA recent Iranian study involving 40 female athletes suffering from knee pain found that, although physiotherapy helped to reduce pain intensity, combining it with dry needling had a much more significant affect. Some may argue that this is merely an example of the placebo effect \u2013 where a treatment works because you believe it will.\n\nChinese researchers carried out a more reliable kind of study to test if this was true.\n\nThey recruited people with lower back pain and assigned some of them to a dry needling treatment, and others to \u2018sham\u2019 needling \u2013 when the needles prick the surface of the skin, but don\u2019t penetrate the muscle.\n\nDry needling was indeed found to be more effective.\n\nDon\u2019t ask me how it works. All I know is that it\u2019s been two weeks since my treatment and I am already back on my bike cycling. Astonishingly, I can even manage a gentle jog.\n\nSprinting, however, is still not on my exercise menu.\n\nI began to wonder if I could have avoided injury by stretching more. I often cycle past my local park on weekends and see swarms of middle-aged men preparing for a run using extravagant stretches.\n\nIt\u2019s a wonder how they manage to get their bodies into such a position. But does it help them avoid injury?\n\nIn fact research suggests that stretching is largely a waste of time.\n\nOne such study involved thousands of Army recruits. Participants were randomly allocated to stretching their leg muscles for several minutes before exercise, or just doing a gentle warm-up instead.\n\nThey were then followed for several months during their exercise sessions.\n\nWhen their rates of injuries were compared, there was no difference between the two groups.\n\nIf you do want to warm up, make it a dynamic routine, using movements such as arm-circling and side-stepping.\n\nThese movements send messages from the brain to the muscles, preparing them for working out.\n\nAs for me, I\u2019m hoping to be back running in a few weeks\u2019 time.\n\nAnd if anyone suggests a sprinting race, I think I\u2019ll be letting them win\u2026", "description": "DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: Two weeks ago, I tore a hamstring in my right leg.
