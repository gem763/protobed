Global trade and manufacturing has collapsed. China's economy is weakening. Germany is on the brink of recession.\n\nThe persistent threat from the US-China trade war, among other geopolitical worries, has added urgency to the RBA's easing policy and governor Philip Lowe has indicated global risks could trigger another cut to 0.75 per cent on Tuesday.\n\nNo wonder, then, that bond yields have dropped. Bond yields reflect the outlook for growth and inflation, and what this will mean for the path of official cash rates. Yields fall as pessimism rises.\n\nYet at the same time as growing pessimism has helped bond returns, Aussie shares have surged by more than 18 per cent in 2019. Add in dividends and you get more like 24 per cent. The performance figures for the American bond and stock holdings are almost identical.\n\nThis is not \"normal\". Historically, stock prices have suffered during such periods as investors begin to factor in lower expected profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we look at the industrials component of the ASX \u2013 essentially those businesses outside the financials, listed property and resources sectors \u2013 we can see that the earnings outlook for these businesses has indeed deteriorated in 2019.\n\nBut this has been more than offset by two things: investors' willingness to pay more for companies as lower rates boost the calculated value of future (even lower) earnings; and falling rates and a dearth of income-producing assets driving people towards stocks offering solid dividends.\n\nBut why has this relationship between stocks and yields changed, and when did it happen? And what does it mean for investors?\n\nMacquarie analysts have been examining these questions. They conclude that \"something changed in financial markets around 2012 that led markets to respond differently to lower bond yields\".\n\nTheir \"working hypothesis is that the key development in 2012 was the shift to NIRP, or negative interest rate policy, which began in Denmark in July 2012\".\n\nThey examined how the ASX's industrial's index has behaved through the cycle in the decade before the advent of negative rates versus the years since.\n\nThey split the cycle into downturn (yields are lower than a year prior and falling \u2013 probably where we are today); recovery (yields are still lower than a year ago but past their lows); expansion (bond rates are higher than a year earlier and are rising); and then slowdown (yields still higher than they were but past their peak).\n\nThe analysis shows how, in the pre-negative rates era, investors typically lost money in industrial stocks during a slowdown (such as this year), but then enjoyed a strong rally in the recovery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince 2012 there have only been two months where a central bank hasn't had a policy rate below zero, and this relationship between yields and stocks has changed.\n\nBy enacting extreme policies, central bankers have effectively pulled forward gains in the recovery period to prop up returns in the downturn. This allows a little money to be made in the downturn as well as in the recovery \u2013 albeit less before 2012.\n\nEssentially, central banks have engineered a world in which industrial stocks provide returns no matter what point we are in the bond cycle. This is highly lucrative, with average returns for industrial stocks of 9 per cent in a world of extraordinarily easy policy, against 2 per cent over the decade preceding it.\n\nSo what are the implications?\n\nFor one, valuations for listed industrial businesses have stayed elevated, so expect underwhelming returns in any recovery. Assuming we stay in a low-growth world and any earnings rebound will be modest, then \"the key risk\" for shareholders would be a rapid rise in bond yields during the \"recovery\" phase.\n\n\"What was once a good time to own stocks could instead favour cash, as bond and stock prices fall,\" they write.\n\nThe Macquarie analysts believe a recession could be the circuit breaker for this new relationship between yields and stockmarket returns.\n\nFor example, bond rates and share prices fell in the final months of 2018 amid growing fears of a US recession and as Aussie house prices were tanking at an accelerating rate.\n\n\"That said, the trends we highlight could become more pronounced if [negative rates] were to come to Australia.\"", "description": "By pushing official rates below zero, central banks have altered the way key financial assets perform through the cycle.
