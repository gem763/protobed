While CBS Evening News\u2019 report from last night might have been implicitly critical of the NYT\u2019s reporting, the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake leaves that mostly as subtext. However, Blake emphasizes just how big a game-changer Leland Keyser\u2019s testimony is in the new book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nFar from an eyewitness that corroborates Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s ambiguous allegation against Kavanaugh, Keyser became a character witness for the defense, Blake reports:\n\nKeyser described having many more reservations than she initially let on. She said she tried to assemble the details as described by Ford, but she called her lawyer and told him, \u201cYou know what, I don\u2019t feel good about something.\u201d First, she said she wouldn\u2019t have just left Ford at the party without accounting for Ford\u2019s ride home. \u201cIt would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she\u2019s going to get home,\u201d Keyser said. \u2026 Keyser said she doesn\u2019t remember many small gatherings like the one Ford described, nor does she remember hanging out much with Georgetown Prep students, which Kavanaugh was. She maintains she didn\u2019t even know who Kavanaugh was back then, after reviewing pictures and maps. \u201cThose facts together I don\u2019t recollect, and it just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Keyser said. Keyser also said she spoke with many people who \u201cwanted me to remember something different\u201d \u2014 suggesting that there was pressure on her to toe the line \u2014 and that she told the FBI about that.\n\nThere have been more than \u201csuggestions\u201d about witness tampering. Reporting on that point stretches all the way back to last October, when the Wall Street Journal broke that part of the story first. It involved a former FBI agent named Monica McLean who had also reportedly helped coach Blasey Ford through her polygraph examination. The FBI sent a separate package of information to the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time dealing with the tampering allegations, but this is the first time that Keyser herself has detailed them, including the potential threat of being smeared. Whether that came from McLean or others is uncertain.\n\nApart from that, what does Keyser think of Kavanaugh himself? She has no recollection of him at all in her high school social circle, but despite her affiliation as a Democrat, Keyser finds him \u201cvery impressive \u2026 He has a very impressive record.\u201d\n\nBlake warns that Democrats can\u2019t just ignore Keyser\u2019s expanded testimony on these matters:\n\nThis new interview suggests that someone who could have been a star witness for Ford, though, is anything but. And as Democrats go big on calling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment \u2014 despite a key clarification from the Times that the supposed victim of the newly alleged assault doesn\u2019t recall it, either \u2014 Keyser\u2019s account isn\u2019t one they can simply ignore. It\u2019s a significant implicit defense of Kavanaugh, from someone with plenty of motivation to be on the other side of this story.\n\nThey certainly can try to ignore it, even though Jan Crawford pointed out last night that it makes Blasey Ford 0-4 among her own hand-picked \u201cwitnesses\u201d to her account. Keyser\u2019s outright denial and her expressed lack of confidence in her friends story should have actually been the NYT\u2019s lead in their news section. In any other circumstances, four denials from Blasey Ford\u2019s own list of corroborating witnesses would have rendered her claims invalid. If her claims were invalid, the Deborah Ramirez claims would have had no credence, especially since it took her six days with activist lawyers to connect Kavanaugh to her claims, and her list of seven corroborating witnesses had even less connection to Ramirez\u2019 claims than Blasey Ford\u2019s did to hers.\n\nIn other words, the real story from this book should have been that Kavanaugh nearly got railroaded, not that he got away with anything. Blake\u2019s a little too kind to connect all those dots, but at least he\u2019s warning Kavanaugh\u2019s opponents that they\u2019re out there to be connected.\n\nUpdate: Not that they shouldn\u2019t have already known that \u2026\n\n@AaronBlake, saw your story in Washington Post on Christine Blasey Ford's star witness Leland Keyser telling NYT reporters she didn't buy her friend's story.
