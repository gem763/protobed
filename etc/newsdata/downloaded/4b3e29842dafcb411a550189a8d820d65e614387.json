PATRICK MARMION reviews A very expensive poison", "language": "en", "text": "A Very Expensive Poison (Old Vic Theatre, London)\n\nVerdict: Slick but flippant docu-drama\n\nRating:\n\nAmsterdam (Orange Tree, Richmond-upon-Thames)\n\nVerdict: Double Dutch\n\nRating:\n\nAlexander \u2018Sasha\u2019 Litvinenko was the Russian exile who made the mistake of taking afternoon tea with a couple of old associates in Mayfair\u2019s Millennium Hotel on November 1, 2006.\n\nShortly after this he fell violently ill and as he lay dying, he helped police solve his murder. Retracing his steps, he eventually learned that his tea had been laced with radioactive polonium.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have thought any of this would be obvious material for comic treatment, but that\u2019s what it gets in this weirdly facetious new play by Lucy Prebble.\n\nAnna Buring as Litvinenko's wife Marina with Tom Brooke, right, as Alexander Litvinenko in A Very Expensive Poison at The Old Vic, London. It is based upon Luke Harding's book about the assassination of Russian spy Litvinenko\n\nIt stars Tom Brooke as Litvinenko, with Peter Polycarpou as the colourful oligarch Boris Berezovsky and Reece Shearsmith as President Vladimir Putin \u2014 who was believed to have authorised the hit.\n\nThe play is based on Luke Harding\u2019s book about the killing and he takes lurid, sometimes breathless pleasure in the events. But Prebble\u2019s adaptation turns the story into a wacky vaudeville affair, with Sasha and his wife Marina talking us through the action.\n\nFar from being a sexy and mysterious spy, Brooke\u2019s Litvinenko is more of a gawky Nicholas Lyndhurst figure. He takes his role as the victim of a brutal state execution very seriously.\n\nThe press night after-party was a star studded event and while the play is at least innovative \u2014 this is only in the way the rack was innovative in medieval England\n\nAnd, as an earnest teetotaller, Litvinenko would surely have been unimpressed by Prebble\u2019s frivolous obituary. At least MyAnna Buring adds a good measure of seriousness as his loyal wife who fought for (and eventually won) a public inquiry into the killing.\n\nThe two assassins, Andrei Lugovoi and Dimitri Kovtun, are mockingly presented as a couple of \u2018useful idiots\u2019, with Michael Shaeffer turning Lugovoi into a petulant playboy and Lloyd Hutchinson making Kovtun a half-witted wannabe porn star.\n\nShearsmith might at least have added menace as Putin, but he plays him as an irritable petty bureaucrat \u2014 nothing like the cold-blooded opportunist we know to occupy the Kremlin today. And as Berezovsky, Polycarpou is a big-hearted party animal given to bursting into song. Again, no trace of the ruthless power-broker.\n\nJohn Crowley\u2019s production is always slick, with a small, neon-framed caf\u00e9 turning into a hospital room and a Moscow flat, before opening out into a vast incident room at Scotland Yard. But comic capering with puppets, kitsch Russian folk songs and half-cooked choreography all set a decidedly odd tone for a real-life murder investigation.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want my assassination reported like this, should I ever have the misfortune to cross Mr Putin.\n\nAMSTERDAM, at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, London, is billed as a thriller. Don\u2019t be deceived: it\u2019s more of a snoozer. A new play by Israeli writer Maya Arad Yasur, it\u2019s about a pregnant Jewish cellist in modern Amsterdam who finds herself in receipt of an unpaid gas bill from 1944.\n\nFour actors take turns to play the cellist, interrupting one another as they simultaneously investigate and concoct stories about the mysterious bill, which leads them to a Nazi collaborator.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing at stake: no characters, no action, no scenes and, robbed of all agency by the author, our cellist doesn\u2019t even have a name. Colourless dialogue is given artificial life by director Matthew Xia and his smiley cast are like teenagers co-presenting a school history project.\n\nHigh points include using a typewriter to create the sound of heels on cobbles and an impressive iron curtain deployed to divide the stage (for no apparent reason). The show is at least innovative \u2014 but only in the way the rack was innovative in medieval England. And Arad Yasur certainly proves quite the expert at stretching out her very meagre material.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that she\u2019s big in Germany, where they like their drama painful. This is Xia\u2019s first venture as director of Actors Touring Company. Be warned.\n\nTorch Song (Turbine Theatre, Battersea)\n\nVerdict: Rough but ready\n\nRating:\n\nLondon needs another theatre like Imelda Marcos needs another pair of shoes. Even so, a new one has arrived next door to Battersea Power Station. And a tidy little venue it is too \u2014 tucked into the arches under the railway lines alongside the leviathan landmark. Planners are nowadays obliged to provide cultural \u2018outreach\u2019 and if the surrounding concrete and glass apartment blocks ever fill up, they\u2019ll have a strong local audience, too.\n\nTorch Song is a two-and-a-half version of Harvey Fierstein's 1982 trilogy about a lovelorn drag queen (pictured). The role has been previously played by Matthew Broderick and the star of this performance is the perfect combination of sour and seedy, as well as sympathetic\n\nResidents should, however, be warned that their eyeballs may pop at some of the shenanigans in this opening play at the tunnel-like 200-seater auditorium, which feels like a brick railway carriage. The work is a reduced (two and a half hour) version of Harvey Fierstein\u2019s 1982 trilogy about a lovelorn drag queen in Seventies Manhattan, which was turned into a film starring Fierstein himself and Matthew Broderick. One scene may even require the Heimlich manoeuvre for sensitive souls and ing\u00e9nues.\n\nMore nuanced matter does, mercifully, follow to occupy the mind. Fierstein wrote zippy and witty dialogue \u2014 like a gay version of Woody Allen. We follow his flamboyant drag queen, Arnold, as he goes from treating himself like a piece of meat to falling in love with a gay man who wants to stay in the closet, through to a hilarious showdown with his disapproving Jewish mother.\n\nWith the physique of a length of rope and a mop of hair like the head of Medusa, Matthew Needham\u2019s Arnold manages to be both sour and seedy, as well as sardonic and sympathetic. He knits himself into knots of anxiety, only to unravel himself and lash fellow actors with his wicked tongue.\n\nBut the best bit is when he comes up against his real nemesis in the shape of Bernice Stegers, with a show-stealing turn as his firecracker suburban mother.\n\nThis is a neat and impressively staged production by Drew McOnie in a space that\u2019s almost as tight as the men\u2019s trousers. And it\u2019s a very promising start for Artistic Director Paul Taylor-Mills, who now just has to maintain high production standards.\n\nA Doll\u2019s House (Lyric, Hammersmith)\n\nVerdict: Ibsen all mixed up with colonialism\n\nRating:\n\nIbsen's play, A Doll\u2019s House, was shocking at its launch in 1879 Copenhagen and is still shocking. It doesn\u2019t threaten the social order any more but it demonstrates brutally how quickly a marriage can collapse, and the fragility of our closest relationships. That\u2019s scary.\n\nDoes that emotional charge have more force when you add colonialism to the mix? In this production, directed by Rachel O\u2019Riordan, the play happens in Calcutta, still in 1879. As Tanika Gupta, who wrote the new adaptation, says: \u2018It opens the door to exploring additional power dynamics \u2014 what happens to the women of India married to Englishmen?\u2019\n\nDoll's House follows the protagonist Niru who is a young Bengali woman married to an English colonial bureaucrat (pictured) and is set in Calcutta\n\nThe Indian context emphasises the extent to which the marriage of Helmer and Niru (formerly Nora) is skewed in his favour. Elliot Cowan, as Helmer, towers over tiny Anjana Vasan, making all his endearments about \u2018my Indian sparrow\u2019 seem apposite rather than yuck. He adores his young Indian bride, his plaything who has, unknown to him, committed forgery with excellent intentions. She almost flutters round the stage, coquettish, with huge eyes.\n\nBut to an embittered blackmailer, her former creditor Kaushik Das, played by Assad Zaman, she is a traitor to her nation and religion.\n\nThe play hopes to 'open the door to exploring additional power dynamics \u2014 what happens to the women of India married to Englishmen?\u2019 as Tanika Gupta wrote\n\nIdentifying her conversion to Christianity as a betrayal adds a new dimension to the play, which has enough emotional baggage already. Niru is not just her husband\u2019s plaything \u2014 she has sold out to the occupier, too.\n\nActually, the lyrical Indian diction and rapid speech of the Indian actresses is the big problem here. The lady next to me said: \u2018I\u2019ve a hearing aid and I can hear the men but not the women.\u2019 Better projection, better articulation, please!\n\nMELANIE McDONAGH\n\nEmotionless songs hit a false note\n\nFalsettos (The Other Palace, London)\n\nVerdict: American musical from hell\n\nRating:\n\nAT the start of this show, the cast bundle on stage screaming: \u2018Four Jews In A Room Bitching\u2019. It\u2019s the first of many \u2018songs\u2019 in this musical, which was a tremendous success Stateside and has now swum to our shores.\n\nIt\u2019s being tried out at Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s The Other Palace, a decent enough venue with a mission to indulge in fresh musical theatre. Hopefully its British holiday ends here, and the deportation papers are in the post. It is the worst musical I have ever seen \u2014 and bear in mind I saw an improvised James Bond musical at the Edinburgh Fringe.\n\nThe cast Bow at the press night performance of \"Falsettos\" at The Other Palace on September 5\n\nWilliam Finn and James Lapine are the creators behind this family drama. Mum has decided to shack up with Dad\u2019s psychiatrist. In the centre is a bland child who loves chess (the game, he\u2019s not a Barbara Dickson fan \u2014 although I wouldn\u2019t put it past him).\n\nThe set is one of the limpest displays on the London stage. It\u2019s a mess of picture frames and badly executed scenic projection, which is awfully distracting.\n\nThe score is scandalously sub-Sondheim stuff; thick glops of dense, chewy lyrics beaten round the face by unfathomably dull, mushy melodies. I know some people enjoy that semi-automatic staccato style, but it sucked out all the emotional heft.\n\nWilliam Finn and James Lapine are the creators behind this production which is a mess of picture frames and badly executed scenic projection\n\nIt\u2019s also entirely sung through, so there\u2019s not even a moment\u2019s break to retune your ears and check for tinnitus.\n\nNot only could I not hum a single tune as I shuffled glumly out of the joint, I couldn\u2019t catch them while they were being sung at me. It was entirely tuneless and wholly glib, with the emotional depth of an emoji.\n\nThere\u2019s a slither of merit \u2014 a smutty quality which I quite liked. And Laura Pitt-Pulford and Oliver Savile (ex-wife and the new boyfriend [SUB\u2019S NOTE: Dad\u2019s new boyfriend \u2014 shouldn\u2019t we mention this?]) have cracking big-band voices. A song where Pitt-Pulford furiously sets the table, knocking back wine and plastering on a ferociously forced smile, is manic fun. The rest, alas, is just manic.\n\nLUKE JONES\n\nHedda Tesman (Minerva, Chichester)\n\nVerdict: Call the clean-up woman!\n\nRating:\n\nIn Ibsen's play Hedda Gabler it's 1891 Norway, and Hedda is an intelligent, neurotic young woman bored by her husband Tesman, fascinated by the drunken brilliant Lovborg, and frustrated by being a wife.\n\nShe burns Lovborg's genius manuscript and lends him her late father's gun to kill himself. Her goth-romantic notion is that it's 'beautiful, brave, brilliant' to take control of your fate. Since her fate is helplessness under the dread patriarchy, she shoots herself, too.. Mysterious, dislikeable and fascinating, Hedda is every actress' dream.\n\nIn Cordelia Lynn's new sequel, set today, she hasn't changed - and the role is finely filled with dangerous, banked-down fury by Haydn Gwynne, a human volcano fit to blow.\n\nFrom her first appearance the energy in the room rises, and Tesman and jolly Aunt Julie scuttle to please her. Which is, of course, impossible. Only her equally angry daughter Thea, boiling with millennial righteousness and obsessed with the alcoholic genius writer (now renamed Elijah) is powerful enough to confront her.\n\nFor we are asked to imagine that Ibsen's Hedda lived on 30 years, bore a daughter, hated motherhood and remained bored with her husband.\n\nBut the setting is 2019, so it becomes a play about the frustrations of modern middle-aged wives. And wobbles around its target.\n\nIt wastes fine acting: a stormingly good performance by Gwynne, fierce Natalie Simpson as the daughter, Anthony Calf sweet as poor Tesman, Jonathan Hyde nicely satanic as Judge Brack, and Irfan Shamji working hard to make sense of drunk Elijah and his awful sociology treatise.\n\nBut terrific acting can't always disguise the essential pointlessness of a play. It just doesn't feel relevant to here and now - or to 1891 either.\n\nIts one shining merit is that the author has expanded the tiny role of the maid Bertha into a young working-class mum, who's an agency cleaner. Every time Rebecca Oldfield comes on with a mop, a bright shaft of reality dispels the self absorbed gloom. She isn't thwarted, because she blooming well works - has to - and looks after her children.\n\nAnd if Hedda shoots herself this time, you know who'll have to clean up the mess. If you want a feminist moral, that's it!\n\nLIBBY PURVES", "description": "PATRICK MARMION: A Very Expensive Poison takes a lurid and breathless pleasure in the murder of the Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko.
