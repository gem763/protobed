But the new ruling means Facebook would have to make such material inaccessible globally.\n\nFacebook charged that the decision \u201cundermines the longstanding principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country.\u201d\n\nWhile lawmakers in the U.S. are considering tighter regulation of Facebook and other tech giants, lawmakers in Europe have gone much further on a variety of fronts, including passing stricter data privacy laws in 2018.\n\n\u201cThis shows a sharpening divide between the way the E.U. is handling privacy and data content versus the U.S.,\u201d Wedbush\u2019 Ives said. \u201cIt poses broader risks for the likes of Google and other big tech companies as the \u2018Brussels versus tech\u2019 battle continues to take hold.\u201d\n\nEva Glawischnig-Piesczek, former chairwoman of Austria\u2019s Green Party, had sued Facebook in her home nation to remove a news story that she considered libelous and insulting and could be viewed globally. An Austrian court ruled in her favor. The country\u2019s top court then asked the EU to weigh in.\n\nThe same EU court ruled last month that the European Union\u2019s \"right to be forgotten\" rules _ which allow people to ask search engines to remove outdated or embossing links about themselves, even if they are true _ do not apply outside the 28-nation bloc.\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling is likely to encourage internet platforms more widely to step up their efforts to monitor user content.\n\nActivists at the European Digital Rights organization said that instead of hiring more \u201ccontent moderators,\u201d companies like Facebook might have to rely on automatic filters. And those, they warned, might be unable to distinguish between legal and illegal content.\n\nThe Computer & Communications Industry Association, a lobbying group that includes Amazon, Facebook and Google, said the ruling could infringe on the right to free speech.\n\n\u201cThe ruling essentially allows one country or region to decide what Internet users around the world can say and what information they can access,\u201d said CCIA Europe senior manager Victoria de Posson.\n\n\u201cWhat might be considered defamatory comments about someone in one country will likely be considered constitutional free speech in another. Few hosting platforms, especially startups, will have the resources to implement elaborate monitoring systems.\u201d", "description": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 The European Union\u2019s highest court ruled Thursday that individual member countries can force Facebook to remove what they regard as unlawful material from the social network all over the world -\u00a0a decision experts say could hinder free speech online and put a heavy burden on tech companies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/ContentBroker_contentid-daad842cc01042edb256c8b2551bb6f4.png"}
