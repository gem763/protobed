If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nOnline shopping can be both the best of times, and the worst of times. It's always a thrill to find a product that you've been eyeing finally go on sale, but then the fear can creep in that maybe you can find it for a lower price somewhere else on the web, or there's a promo code you're missing out on, or maybe the retailer jacked up the original price just to trick you. It can be too easy to second-guess a purchase before clicking that \"order now\" button, but here at Reviewed, we want to take all the guess work out of online shopping for you.\n\nEach day we scour the internet to supply our readers with the absolute best deals, the lowest price drops, and the can't-miss discounts. Naturally a ton of these are found on Amazon, so we compile a list of our top five picks daily. Today, we found some fantastic sales on Dash Air Fryers, iRobot Roombas, and more.\n\n1.

Though they can err on the more expensive side, right now the iRobot Roomba 980 is at its lowest price ever\u2014$633.99, to be exact\u2014a whopping $265 off its usual retail price. We were wowed by the 980 when we tested it earlier this year, specifically for its connectivity, battery life, and impressive navigational skills that made it the first robot vacuum we'd recommend for multi-room cleaning.\n\nGet the iRobot Roomba 980 for $633.99 (Save $265)\n\n2.

We all crave some crispy fries and chicken fingers from time to time, but if you want a way to enjoy these snacks in a healthier way, consider investing in an air fryer. This one from Dash comes highly-rated and will look fab on your kitchen counter, especially in the mint color. The compact version of Dash's air fryer scored highly in our tests, so we expect the Deluxe version to perform just as well.
