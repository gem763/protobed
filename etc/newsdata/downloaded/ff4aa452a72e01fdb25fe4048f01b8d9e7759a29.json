You can\u2019t question their effort.\u201d\n\nHaving cemented second place in the pool behind England, three-times finalists France will now head to Yokohama seeking victory over Eddie Jones\u2019s men for a kinder route through the knockout rounds.\n\nFrance, labouring to a 33-9 win over the United States on Wednesday, were switched on from the first whistle on Sunday and the flair and enterprise of Virimi Vakatawa and Alivereti Raka quickly caught the eye.\n\nRaka burst away from a botched Tongan lineout before off-loading to centre Vakatawa for France\u2019s first try in the fifth minute as France went 10-0 up.\n\n\u201cFor me, happy playing next to another Fijian,\u201d Raka said of his partnership with Vakatawa. \u201cWe talk a lot and we are talking on the same level so it\u2019s easy for us.\u201d\n\nFrance did lose momentum, with handling errors and passes floating forward and wide, but their defence remained solid and they hit top gear again when scrumhalf Baptiste Serin caught Tonga napping with a quick-tap penalty, whipping the ball wide to a charging Raka who kicked a grubber past the last defender and collected it on the try-line.\n\nFORWARD MUSCLE\n\nTonga needed to respond and did so through forward muscle. Snatching the ball out of a ruck and leaping for the line, scrumhalf Sonatane Takulua was rewarded with a try after a lengthy TMO review to give Tonga a huge boost and make it 17-7 at halftime.\n\nThe match turned on its head shortly after the break, with a thrilling try to France flanker Charles Ollivon ruled out by the TMO due to a forward pass.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nTonga immediately won a turnover with a bone-jarring tackle in midfield and winger Cooper Vuna hoofed the balldown field, the ball bouncing wickedly and straight into the arms of gleeful centre Malietoa Hingano who barged over.\n\nWith the ghosts of 2011 stirring, France redoubled their intensity at the breakdown and the pressure told as Tonga\u2019s discipline waned. Ntamack knocked over a pair of penalties to give his team breathing space at 23-14 and the match appeared settled when winger Damien Penaud cantered over in the 68th minute.\n\nBut again, the try was cancelled to leave French fans howling, with a knock-on by fullback Maxime Medard spotted by the TMO.", "description": "France withstood a furious Tonga fightback to grind into the quarter-finals of the Rugby World Cup on Sunday with a nerve-jangling 23-21 win that only just banished the ghosts of their shock loss to the Pacific islanders at the 2011 tournament.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437672529&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9508X", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
