We realise on this occasion some customers are disappointed by this and we will be working with our crew to ensure children have a choice of which sticker they receive.\u201d", "description": "A year after Tui faced accusations of sexism\u00a0for handing out gendered stickers to children on its flights, the travel firm has been accused of issuing them again.\u00a0 Cabin\u00a0crew\u00a0were found to be giving out stickers reading \u201cFuture Tui captain\u201d to boys and \u201cFuture Tui cabin crew\u201d to girls\u00a0during its flights in August 2018.", "authors": ["Cathy Adams"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/23/09/tui-sexist-stickers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
