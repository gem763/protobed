Carol Danvers had been his favourite superhero in the Marvel comics and with the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s film meaning so much to the pair, John had to get Brie involved somehow.\n\nHe admitted he hardly remembers the moment as he was so caught up, but he wonders whether Brie\u2019s initial reaction may have been something along the lines of \u2018oh my god\u2019.\n\nJohn and Richard watched Captain Marvel on their first date (Picture: John Chambrone)\n\nYes, the ring has the Infinity Stones (Picture: John Chambrone)\n\n\u2018She was just as shocked as Richard!\u2019 John told us from Tampa, Florida.\n\nHe continued: \u2018Richard saw her tear up as we walked out. I was just so focused on him I really didn\u2019t look at her much!\n\n\u2018I was just so overjoyed seeing that beautiful smile bigger than I have ever seen and could not look away.\u2019\n\nOn the reaction of the fans waiting to get their photo taken, John said the whole crowd was \u2018clapping and congratulating us\u2019.\n\nCarol Danvers is John\u2019s favourite superhero (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nAs the pair waited for the moment with the star, John admitted he was \u2018shaking a bit and a little sweaty\u2019 which caused Richard to think something was up.\n\n\u2018He was concerned something was wrong but just figured since we were about to meet the amazing Brie Larson \u2013 which was a dream come true \u2013 it was just nerves,\u2019 he joked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn their way out, John handed Brie a letter explaining why he wanted their meet and greet to act as the perfect proposal setting, apologising for \u2018ambushing\u2019 her.\n\nJohn's letter to Brie in full Dear Brie: First off THANK YOU for making yourself accessible to your fans. Sorry to \u2018ambush\u2019 you with the proposal, but there is a reason why once I knew we were going to meet you, that it would be the perfect opportunity to pledge my love to Richard Owen and promise to love him forever. Ever since I was a kid, Carol Danvers has been my favorite character in the comics. From her debut as Ms. Marvel, through her Binary and Warbird years and finally full circle as the mighty Captain Marvel, I have followed her adventures and your portrayal of her was so on point! I met Richard earlier this year and once our eyes locked for the first time, we both knew we found our soulmates. Our first real date was to see \u2018Captain Marvel\u2019-it was actually his first MCU film and he instantly became a fan! The movie meant a lot to us and I was so glad that he now shares my passion for the greatest superhero in all the known universes. Thank you again for your incredible performance of my favorite hero. Meeting you today, and being able to profess my love and commitment to my boyfriend in front of you truly meant the world to me, and to us! Looking forward to how higher, further and faster my love grows daily with Richard Owen! THANK YOU!! John Chambrone\n\nShe evidently loved being caught in the middle, as she took to Twitter to share the heartwarming moment (and her hilarious reaction).\n\nY\u2019all I was present for a proposal and I am CHANGED. Much love to the happy couple!!!! https://t.co/UMc4WofFja \u2014 Brie Larson (@brielarson) October 13, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Y\u2019all I was present for a proposal and I am CHANGED,\u2019 she wrote alongside the images.\n\n\u2018Much love to the happy couple!!!!\u2019\n\nDespite the pair not having heard back from Brie personally yet, John wants the actor to know she\u2019s got an invitation to the wedding and the pair would love to see her there.\n\nAs would the world!\n\n\u2018Richard and I would love to get the opportunity to speak with her,\u2019 he said. \u2018We are huge fans.\n\n\u2018And yes, she has an invite to the wedding!\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
