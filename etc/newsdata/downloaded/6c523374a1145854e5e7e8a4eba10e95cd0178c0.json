The nation\u2019s state-run oil company is also apparently attempting to send Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to pay suppliers via the central bank.\n\nNaturally, many commentators have celebrated this as wildly bullish for Bitcoin and crypto more generally. However, not everyone is as convinced.\n\nAre Efforts to Evade Sanctions with Bitcoin Likely to be Well-Received?\n\nAccording to a report in Bloomberg earlier today, Banco Central de Venezuela is currently exploring the use of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether to evade economic sanctions levied against the nation.\n\nThe state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, reportedly has a cache of cryptocurrencies and is hoping for the central bank to use the funds to pay suppliers. The article, citing people wishing to remain anonymous, says that the bank is also exploring how digital assets like Bitcoin could become part of the nation\u2019s international reserves.\n\nThere is no indication as to how Petroleos de Venezuela SA has come to own Bitcoin and Ether. However, one Venezuelan Bitcoin enthusiast speculated that it was seized as part of earlier crackdowns on mining equipment:\n\nHow Venezuela came to own Bitcoin or Ethereum? The Bloomberg article didn't say. But you can ask any Venezuelan: The corrupt goverment officials mined crypto with seized and stolen equipment, now they find themselves with coins they cannot exchange. 1/3 \u2014 \u26a1\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7Eduardo\ud83c\uddfb\ud83c\uddea\u26a1 (@Codiox) September 26, 2019\n\nNaturally, many analysts and people will vested interests in Bitcoin\u2019s future have taken to Twitter to claim the development as bullish for the digital asset industry:\n\nMany will laugh at Venezuela's attempt to avoid sanctions, that's until bitcoin rallies past everyone's expectations. Then country that first started storing bitcoin will get the last laugh. \u2014 Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) September 26, 2019\n\nHowever, not everyone believes that the use of Bitcoin in such a way is a particularly strong look for the still young currency. Economist and trader Alex Kr\u00fcger claimed that \u201ccommon sense indicates this is not at all bullish.\u201d\n\nBitcoiners are celebrating the central bank of the 9th most corrupt country in the world considering holding bitcoin \u2026 as Petroleos de Venezuela somehow owns some bitcoin and is desperate to use it to skirt US sanctions. Common sense indicates this is not at all bullish. \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro) September 26, 2019\n\nTaking a similar stance as Kr\u00fcger was Twitter user Tony Valentino. They extend on Kr\u00fcger\u2019s overall pessimism at the development by stating that it would likely form the justification for a US-led Western crackdown on cryptocurrency. Valentino goes as far as to describe it as a \u201cdump-bitcoin indicator\u201d:\n\nNothing to be proud about when nations like Venezuela and Iran are holding bitcoin via their central banks. This only means the US and the Western World will go hard after bitcoin and ban it on the entry and exit ramps. This is a dump-bitcoin indicator https://t.co/bt7GWdK7UV \u2014 Tony Valentino (@TonyVal76476318) September 26, 2019\n\nKey members of the US government have already expressed distaste for crypto assets earlier this year. Clearly fearing that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies pose a threat to law and order, President Trump tweeted the following in July:\n\nI am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019\n\nSimilarly, the current Treasury Secretary of the US, Steven Mnuchin, stated the following of crypto assets:\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a national security issue\u2026 Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs, and human trafficking,\u201d\n\nIf Venezuela manages to thrive despite sanctions, it is not at all out of the question that the Trump administration might take swift action against the industry, much like it has done recently with electronic cigarettes.\n\nRelated Reading: Venezuelan Crypto Regulator Urges Public to Use Petro For Remittances\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Earlier today, news broke that the central bank of Venezula is in tests to see whether it would be advantageous for the institution to hold cryptocurrency", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bitcoin-petro-crypto-venezuela-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
