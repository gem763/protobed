Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said during an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Swalwell added that nobody in the Democratic leadership, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, was informed of the raid.\n\nIn a national address on Sunday morning, Trump described a daring nighttime airborne raid by American special operations forces in Syria's northwestern Idlib province and said they flew over heavily militarized territory controlled by multiple nations and forces. No U.S. troops were killed or injured in the operation, Trump said.\n\nTRUMP DESCRIBES AL-BAGHDADI AS 'WHIMPERING AND CRYING' BEFORE DYING IN U.S. OPERATION: 'HE DIED LIKE A COWARD'\n\nAs U.S. troops bore down on al-Baghdadi, he fled into a \"dead-end\" tunnel with three of his children, Trump said, and detonated a suicide vest. \"He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's gone,\" Trump said. \"He died like a dog, he died like a coward.\" Al-Baghdadi's identity was positively confirmed by a DNA test conducted onsite, Trump said.\n\nPelosi, in a statement released shortly after the president\u2019s address, thanked the U.S. Special Operations forces for carrying out the raid \u2013 praising \u201cthe heroism, dedication and skill of our military and our intelligence professionals\u201d \u2013 but questioned why the Trump administration choose to notify other nations of the raid and not congressional lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region,\u201d she said. \u201cOur military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington.\u201d\n\nThe eight U.S. helicopters involved in the raid flew through air space controlled jointly by Russia and Turkey. The Turkish official said in a written statement Sunday that there has been \"close coordination\" among relevant parties and the Turkish military had advanced knowledge of the raid.\n\nTrump on Sunday said that he had notified some congressional lawmakers before the raid, but not Pelosi because he did not want the information leaking to the public before it took place.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t do that. I wanted to make sure this kept secret,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have people lost.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence, however, downplayed Trump\u2019s decision to keep Pelosi in the dark in an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday\" immediately following Trump\u2019s address. The vice president claimed that Trump did not mean to say he did not trust the House Speaker.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that was the implication at all,\u201d Pence said. When pressed on the issue, the vice president said, \u201cWe maintain the tightest possible security here,\u201d and focused on Trump\u2019s goal, which was to bring al-Baghdadi to justice.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "Despite nearly universal praise for the U.S. troops involved in the raid on Saturday that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leading congressional Democrats were unhappy that the Trump Administration failed to brief them beforehand.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/21/694940094001_6096402229001_6096401049001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
