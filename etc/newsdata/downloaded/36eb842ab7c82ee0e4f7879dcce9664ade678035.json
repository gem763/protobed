Yes, a 1,000 percent. Do I identify with my natural-born gender? A thousand percent,\u201d said YouTube star Trisha Paytas, in a video that includes advertisements for tickets to her late-October events in San Francisco and Los Angeles. \u201cSo, I think that\u2019s where I\u2019m at, and I feel really free and liberated.\u201d\n\nPaytas quickly apologized when critics claimed her transgender claim ridiculed the transgender movement. The EOnline.com entertainment site reported:\n\nIn a tearful YouTube video, the star says that she is \u201coverwhelmed by the amount of backlash\u201d her candid video received. \u201cI can\u2019t apologize for who I am and how I feel and it sucks that we live in this world and I\u2019m just not allowed to identify as a man because of how I look,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s triggering. It\u2019s PTSD of when I said that I was, like, bisexual.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaytas\u2019s video is super, duper problematic,\u201d says an earnest post at Popdust.com, which continues:\n\nOne Twitter user compiled a list of just some of the statements Paytas made that led me to shout at my screen. These include assertions like \u201cI am transgender because I wish I had a penis so that my assertiveness would be respected and I wouldn\u2019t be thought of as a bitch,\u201d and also, \u201cI CHOOSE to identify as boy.\u201d No doubt about it, Paytas\u2019s video is a trainwreck, and I understand where all the transgender] backlash is coming from. The way she talks about and misidentifies transgenderism dilutes its seriousness, and the visibility of her platform poses a danger for actual transgender people who need to be taken seriously in order to get the medical and psychological assistance they need. \u2026 Paytas has every right to express herself as gender nonconforming. She\u2019s more than welcome to present herself as male. But that does not make her transgender. Transgender people don\u2019t choose to be transgender. Nobody chooses to have gender dysphoria. So many transgender issues revolve around access to healthcare procedures to correct the underlying issue of dysphoria. It is not a choice.\n\nHer video earned her over 84,000 downvotes \u2014 and a shipload of publicity:\n\nTrisha Paytas announced that she's \"a transgender female to male\" but still identifies with her \"natural born gender\" in a new video that's being slammed by viewers: https://t.co/daCbI3Hsvq \u2014 HollywoodLife (@HollywoodLife) October 8, 2019\n\nShe posted a tearful apology video:\n\nBut the progressives who power the transgender ideology are not pushing sexual liberation. They are imposing a regime of sexual autonomy that would deny people the right to use the social rules that humans have gradually evolved to manage the cooperation and competition between the two complementary and equal legal sexes.\n\nThe radical goals were recently endorsed by the Americal Psychological Society, which awarded a prize in 2018 to an article calling for a cultural revolution that ends the dominant role of heterosexuality in society:\n\nThere are enormous costs to maintaining the gender binary. These costs include the myriad negative consequences of gender stereotyping and prejudice. For these reasons, the gender binary should be replaced by a conception of gender/sex that stresses multiplicity and diversity, including a multiplecategory (rather than binary) system, whose categories are not mutually exclusive (one can identify as more than one), fluid (one\u2019s identity can change across time), and allow for the possibility that gender is viewed as irrelevant to the self.\n\nTo change the public\u2019s view that heterosexuality is the normal and best path for most people, the pro-transgender progressives have adopted a strategy of using their allies in universities, media, and marketing to first downplay the linguistic, legal, and civic distinctions between the two sexes. For example, progressives are using the vague idea of \u201cgender\u201d to bury the obvious notion of \u201cmale or female.\u201d This rhetorical carpet-bombing has also encouraged the claim that men who live as women possess a \u201cfemale penis\u201d \u2014 and it denies women the right to call themselves transgender if they also love men.", "description": "A woman who says she is \"transgender\" and also wants to keep sleeping with men, is getting hate mail from transgender activists.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Trisha-Paytas-file17-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
