There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nThe obvious consequence of the NBA refusing to discipline Morey was that what happened to the Rockets \u2014 effectively being erased from a country in which it had millions of fans \u2014 could go league-wide. Multiple teams are already exploring what they could do in a scenario where the league\u2019s salary cap drops 10 to 15 percent, representing hundreds of millions lost in annual revenue.\n\nSilver said the league is already seeing those consequences with game broadcasts still suspended in China, but also noted the league is willing to cope with whatever happens next:\n\nStory continues\n\nSilver said the league is \u201cnot only willing\u201d to cope with losses of millions in revenues, \u201cbut we are. The losses have already been substantial. Our games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know where we go from here,\u201d said Silver in his first U.S. interview about the league\u2019s emerging conflict with China since he returned home from the country. \u201cThe financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\u201d\n\nFunnily enough, had Silver taken this stance \u2014 publicly affirming Morey will not be disciplined, saying the league will deal with China\u2019s backlash but will not apologize \u2014 in the days immediately after the tweet, he might have saved the NBA from the domestic backlash it experienced over the matter.\n\nIt has been a surreal month for Adam Silver.

Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d as \u201cregrettable\u201d and having \u201cdeeply offended\u201d Chinese fans. It evaluated the tweet in an even harsher light in a statement released in Mandarin. That first statement is what caused politicians on both sides of the aisle to condemn the league for acquiescing to an authoritarian government to preserve revenue.\n\nSilver released a second statement days later that did a better job of not throwing Morey under the bus, but the narrative around the league\u2019s treatment of China had already formed.\n\nPlayers and coaches were asked about the matter and held off from supporting Morey to avoid a similar backlash, just as the NBA had done. And then LeBron James took it a step forward and criticized Morey for not considering the harm certain people could have experienced \u201cnot only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\u201d\n\nHowever, Silver contended Thursday that he didn\u2019t believe the league ever acquiesced to China:\n\nSilver said that the media coverage of the NBA\u2019s response to Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cfrankly was confusing to me when I got home [from China]. Only because I had thought we\u2019d taken a principled position. I thought we hadn\u2019t so-called \u2018acquiesced\u2019 to the Chinese.\u201d The NBA\u2019s initial statement last week used the word \u201cregrettable,\u201d which Silver emphasized was describing the reaction of Chinese government officials, business executives and NBA fans in China \u2014 not the content of Morey\u2019s tweet itself. \u201cMaybe I was trying too hard to be a diplomat,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it as my role as the commissioner of the NBA to weigh in on the substance of the protest, but to say here\u2019s this platform\u201d for free expression.\n\nRegarding Silver\u2019s point of a principled position, treating Morey\u2019s tweet as something regrettable and offensive when it was a simple show of support for a pro-democracy protest against a government with several reported human rights abuses is absolutely what China wanted. The country\u2019s government clearly preferred Morey be fired to show even speaking out against China can carry consequences overseas, but the entire league declining to support Morey\u2019s relatively tame statement was enough to show the country\u2019s influence.\n\nWe\u2019ll see if the NBA\u2019s reputation comes back from that.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The NBA commissioner said the league refused to discipline the Rockets executive in any capacity.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lda708fG8_tZSuitiTtDdw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DUbQppNFSvhCo7FRMlxNRA--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/60124430-f123-11e9-bff6-e7553b2fc246", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
