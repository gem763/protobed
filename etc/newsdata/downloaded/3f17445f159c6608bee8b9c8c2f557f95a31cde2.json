During the second break, dozens of Bulgaria fans involved in the chanting, many of them wearing dark hoodies, left the stadium.\n\n\"I would like to see a very stringent review by UEFA because I know they take racism very seriously,\" English FA Chairman Greg Clarke said. \"We should join a movement to drive racism out of our game and have zero tolerance for it.\"\n\nThe FA also issued a statement saying the England players \"were subjected to abhorrent racist chanting,\" which seemed to be aimed mainly at black players like Raheem Sterling and Tyrone Mings.\n\n\"As we are sadly aware, this is not the first time our players have been subjected to this level of abuse and there is no place for this kind of behavior in society, let alone in football. We will be asking UEFA to investigate as a matter of urgency,\" the FA said.\n\nMings initially asked one of the assistant referees if he had heard the chants and England coach Gareth Southgate then held a discussion with the fourth official before the game was halted for the first time.\n\n\"It was quite clear to hear on the pitch, but we showed a great response, we showed a good togetherness and ultimately we let the football do the talking,\" Mings told ITV. \"We made a decision at halftime to come out and play the game which we thought was the right decision and if anything else had happened we would have taken appropriate action.\"\n\nThe delays led to six minutes of added time, during which Sterling tapped in England's fourth goal.\n\nBulgaria captain Ivelin Popov appeared to have a heated debate with a section of home fans, asking them to stop the chants, as the rest of the players went to the dressing rooms at half time.\n\nThe second half passed without interruption, with Sterling scoring his second goal with a precise finish in the 69th, and Kane completing the rout in the 85th, shortly after he was denied by the post.\n\nThe Vasil Levski Stadium in Sofia was already subject to a partial closure for the match after Bulgaria was sanctioned for racist chanting during qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic.\n\n\"We have made two statements by winning the game but also we have raised the awareness of everyone of the situation,\" Southgate said. \"The game was stopped twice. I know for some people that won't be enough.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
