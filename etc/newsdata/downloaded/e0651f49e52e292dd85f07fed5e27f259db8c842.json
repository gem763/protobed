Most students qualify, but in order to get their share of these funds for college they need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, otherwise known as the FAFSA. Students can begin completing the FAFSA for the 2020-2021 school year on October 1st, and because FAFSA funds are distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis, they will want to complete the form as soon as possible. While the process of applying for federal student aid may feel overwhelming, recent updates to the FAFSA have made it simpler and more stream-lined. CNBC Make It filled out the FAFSA ourselves to see what it takes. Here is a step-by-step guide:\n\nStep 1: Make a list of schools\n\nStudents will need to share their FAFSA with schools they are interested in applying to. For this reason, students should make a list of schools they are potentially interested in before they even begin filling out the form. As part of completing their application, students will be able to look up the federal school codes of colleges and universities they are interested in sending their information to. Making a list of target schools is a good way for students to inspire and motivate themselves to complete the FAFSA.\n\nStep 2: Gather financial documents\n\nThe FAFSA determines how much financial assistance students qualify for, which is why applicants must submit documentation about their family's financial status. Before starting the FAFSA, applicants should be sure to gather all of the forms and documents they'll need. To complete the FAFSA, students will need: A Social Security number\n\nAn Alien Registration number (For non-U.S. citizens)\n\nFederal income tax returns, W-2s, and other records of money earned (Thanks to the newly-updated IRS data retrieval tool, applicants may be able to automatically transfer their tax return information instead.)\n\nBank statements and records of any investments\n\nRecords of any untaxed income\n\n@eddie_rios via Twenty20\n\nStep 3: Create a Federal Student Aid ID\n\nHaving prepared a list of schools and documentation, the next step is for applications to visit the FAFSA website (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa) or the myStudentAid app.\n\n\n\nTo log into the site, students and parents need to create a Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID, which will require making a username and password. Once applicants have created an FSA ID, they can start the FAFSA, save their progress and log in and out as they wish.\n\nStep 4: Start the FAFSA for the desired year\n\nEach year there is a nine-month period during which students can submit financial aid applications for both the current year and future years. Students should carefully select which year's FAFSA application they would like to complete: Students attending college from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 can file the 2019 - 2020 FAFSA between October 1st, 2018 and June 30th, 2020 using their 2017 tax information.\n\nStudents attending college from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 can file the 2020 - 2021 FAFSA between October 1st, 2019 and June 30th, 2021 using their 2018 tax information.\n\nStep 5: Follow the instructions carefully\n\nThe FAFSA itself is broken into seven sections: student demographics, school selection, dependency status, parent demographics, financial information, sign and submit, and confirmation. Complete each of these sections carefully, making sure that the information is accurate: Student demographics: The student's name, social security number, date of birth, address, email, gender, telephone number, driver's license number (if the student has a driver's license), marital status, citizenship status, education history and interest in work-study.\n\nThe student's name, social security number, date of birth, address, email, gender, telephone number, driver's license number (if the student has a driver's license), marital status, citizenship status, education history and interest in work-study.
