When we said to him if this was your son you would be trying to do the same to get justice for him.\n\n\"He agreed with that and said he said he will now push to look at this from a different angle.\"\n\nMs Charles said Trump told her Anne Sarcoolas was inside the White House and offered to introduce them, however she declined the offer.\n\nShe added that the President held her hand during the meeting.\n\n(Image: Justice4Harry)\n\nThe mum added that her son would have been 'a little blown away' by the meeting with Trump, reports say.\n\nThe President told the family that 'his good friend' Boris Johnson called him to see if anything could be done about their son's case, according to Sky News.\n\nBefore arriving at the White House, dad Tim Dunn told Mirror Online: \"We are surprised we have been invited to the White House - we are not sure exactly who we are seeing yet.\"\n\nThe couple recently urged the authorities to bring Anne Sacoolas back to the UK after she fled to the US.\n\nHarry, 19, was killed in a car crash with Ms Sacoolas, a diplomat's wife, near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Sacoolas, 42, has admitted driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit him on his motorbike.\n\nHer lawyer urged his family to ask media to stop trying to reach her as she claimed diplomatic immunity.\n\n(Image: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror)\n\n\"Somewhere, somebody has made a decision to give this lady immunity,\" Mr Dunn said.\n\n\"She's not entitled to immunity as it's been said and we've known that from the start.\n\n\"They made a mistake, someone has made a mistake.\n\n\"On that night there was an accident, a lady made a mistake, she killed our son, she didn't mean to kill him, she didn't mean to have an accident, but you cannot walk away from that and just leave and expect nothing to happen.\n\n\"Our boy died and he deserves to have some justice.\n\n\"That's all we want.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn met the President to talk about the death of their 19-year-old son", "authors": ["Andy Lines", "Image", "Phil Harris Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20588293.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196032454.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
