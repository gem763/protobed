The delivery firm said the discrepancy was to compensate for lower contributions to his pension scheme.\n\n\"I thought that was fair,\" she said. \"I received a pension reward that was appropriate for the time.\"\n\nCommenting on what she did at Royal Mail to improve diversity, she said: \"Logistics is and was a male-dominated industry. I think at Royal Mail we were able to increase the number of women in all roles. We also helped raise awareness that logistics had a long way to go.\"\n\n'Cut through'\n\nOther high profile backers of the campaign include broadcaster Clare Balding, Land Securities' chairwoman Dame Alison Carnwath, Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who was chief executive of Virgin Money from 2007 to 2018, and Baroness Dido Harding, chairman of NHS Improvement and former chief executive of TalkTalk.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The campaign is hoping to plug into the wider #MeToo movement\n\nSome might question the wisdom of harnessing the name of the pay campaign to the original and more famous anti-sexual abuse #MeToo movement.\n\n\"What we thought was that in the UK today, there is so much of importance going on that it is so hard to get 'cut through',\" says Dame Moya.\n\n\"This campaign allows us to morph from the sexual harassment aspects of discrimination and move it into another area.\"", "description": "A group of 100 of the UK's most successful businesswomen want to end the gender pay gap.", "authors": ["Bill Wilson", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11F3F/production/_109053537_womenceo-split-afp-pa-2.jpg"}
