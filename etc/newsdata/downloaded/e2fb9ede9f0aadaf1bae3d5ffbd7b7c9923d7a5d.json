The EU has set a deadline for a deal to be reached by Oct. 31.\n\nBritish parliament has rejected the deal May agreed with the EU. Johnson has said he wants to secure an amended deal at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18 but that Britain will leave the bloc if that is not possible. He will meet European Council Donald Tusk at the United Nations in New York next week.\n\nIreland is crucial to any Brexit solution. Unless the Irish border backstop is removed or amended, Johnson will not be able to win parliamentary approval but Ireland and the EU are unwilling to sign a deal without a solution to the border.\n\nThe EU fears a hard border could cause unrest in Northern Ireland and undermine the fragile peace provided by a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of violence between Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland, and the British security forces and pro-British \u201cunionists\u201d.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement that was agreed with the EU last November says the United Kingdom will remain in a customs union \u201cunless and until\u201d alternative arrangements are found to avoid the return of border controls in Ireland.\n\nEuropean Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier attends a meeting with Britain's Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, September 20, 2019.
