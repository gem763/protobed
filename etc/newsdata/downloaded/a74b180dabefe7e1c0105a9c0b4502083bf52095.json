In this way, the election of Justin Trudeau seemed for many to be a repudiation of the Harper agenda and a return to the normalcy of Canada\u2019s past.\n\nAt first, Trudeau seemed unable to disappoint. He could not have appeared a starker contrast from Harper, regarded by many Canadians as cold and uncharismatic. Youthful, charming and handsome, Trudeau\u2019s progressive messaging immediately stood apart from Harper\u2019s. His policies appeared to do so, too.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Trudeau even went to Toronto\u2019s airport to welcome some of the first refugees, saying: \u201cYou are home.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberals emphasized a multicultural Canada that would be open to refugees. This diversity would be represented in their government, too. In contrast to some Conservative leadership candidates\u2019 embrace of Islamophobia and a \u201cbarbaric cultural practices tip line,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s government included a record number of Muslim MPs. Trudeau also became the first Canadian prime minister to march in a Pride parade.\n\nTrudeau ran in 2015 on a message of environmental protection, support for Indigenous nations in Canada and global feminism. This included instituting a feminist foreign policy agenda and a reorientation of Canada\u2019s development aid programming on a Feminist International Assistance Policy. When asked why he established gender parity for his first cabinet, he famously retorted: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d\n\nHis government legalized cannabis sales and reversed Harper\u2019s anti-science restrictions on research. It increased immigration quotas and reasserted Canadian support for multilateral institutions and international law. This seemed like a return to form for Canada on the international stage and Trudeau emphasized this by saying: \u201cCanada is back.\u201d\n\nCanadians largely seemed happy with his leadership and his government rode high in the polls. His popularity only seemed to skyrocket at home and abroad with the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States in 2016.\n\nFor liberals around the world, Trudeau seemed to represent everything the new president was not. Before long, Trudeau became a global symbol in the worldwide struggle against the rise of authoritarianism, populism and white nationalism.\n\nSo what happened? Why did Trudeau have to fight for his political life this election against the Conservatives, the New Democratic Party and a resurgent Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a separatist party that only runs candidates in Qu\u00e9bec?\n\nAs often happens in Canada, questions about Trudeau\u2019s progressive credentials arose in the Middle East.\n\nBeing progressive in Canada often includes support for Palestinian rights. This was in part a result of Harper\u2019s very partisan pro-Israel approach to governance, which included a crackdown on Canadian advocates for Palestinian rights.\n\nThough Trudeau\u2019s Liberals did reinvest funds that Harper\u2019s Conservatives cut from Palestinian refugees, progressives quickly noticed how Trudeau and his government would go out of their way to attack Canadians who advocated for Palestinian rights. This was accompanied by robust diplomatic support for the policies of the right-wing Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, who was the antithesis of everything Trudeau was supposed to represent.\n\nIn region after region, Liberal foreign policy appeared to come out of the Harper playbook. This included Canada\u2019s participation in a campaign to force regime change in oil-rich Venezuela and approving record weapons sales to a notorious human rights violator, Saudi Arabia, as it wages a brutal war in Yemen.\n\nEven Trudeau\u2019s feminist foreign policy seemed hollow.\n\nWhat good did it do for Yemeni women whose communities are being destroyed with Canadian weapons, Palestinian women shot for protesting the blockade on Gaza or Venezuelan women impoverished by a Canadian-backed economic blockade?\n\nFrom his rapid retreat from a campaign pledge for proportional electoral representation to his odd fascination with fancy dress and concerns about the sincerity of his progressive credentials, cumulative questions arose about Trudeau domestically.\n\nTwo particular events, though, were critical to undoing his progressive brand.\n\nFirst was his government\u2019s $4.5bn purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline from U.S.-based corporation Kinder Morgan. This was highly unpopular with environmentalists and the First Nations communities it would run through. This raised serious questions about Trudeau\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change and helping Indigenous Peoples, too.\n\nSecond was his government\u2019s attempt to halt criminal proceedings into Qu\u00e9bec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin for overseas corruption. This led to the resignation from cabinet of Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada\u2019s first Indigenous minister of justice.\n\nShe complained she was pressured into considering a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin, and was joined in solidarity in her departure from cabinet by another of Trudeau\u2019s most prominent female ministers, Jane Philpott.\n\nBoth were then pushed out of the Liberal caucus, topping off a scandal that raised questions about Trudeau\u2019s commitment to corporate good governance, women\u2019s empowerment and Indigenous leadership.\n\nThe campaign trail emergence of images of a younger Trudeau in blackface was also shocking to progressive voters. The photos decidedly tarnished his image, both at home and abroad.\n\nCanada is a diverse country with a diverse electorate. Many Canadian voters, and the core Liberal constituency, still supported Trudeau. This kept him relevant in the 2019 election campaign. A late campaign endorsement by former U.S. president Barack Obama also served as a reminder of what Trudeau still symbolizes to many liberals around the world.\n\nThough Trudeau\u2019s struggles may seem surprising, the inability of his government to truly address deep structural inequalities and income insecurity in Canada fits a pattern of the fracturing of the political landscape of nearly every other liberal democracy. This plagued Obama\u2019s administration as well.\n\nHaving a family name and background that symbolizes privilege, in a world where wealth inequality and nepotism have become such divisive topics, hasn\u2019t helped Trudeau.\n\nDissatisfied with Trudeau, some of Canada\u2019s large progressive electorate, as well as Qu\u00e9bec voters, began to look elsewhere, to the New Democrats and the Greens, and in Qu\u00e9bec, to the resurgent Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which took particular advantage of Trudeau\u2019s missteps on the environment.\n\nTrudeau had problems this election because he lost part of the progressive base that put him over the top in 2015, and because the Bloc turned out to be a bigger force in vote-rich Qu\u00e9bec than expected.\n\nJeremy Wildeman is a research associate in international development at the University of Bath\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
