John Krasinski here and it is October 20th, which means it's my 40th birthday,' he started out his social media rant. 'And I know what a lot of you are thinking \u2013 wow, he's old. Thank you, I am. What you also might be thinking is, 'Really, that must have slipped my mind, what do I get that guy on his big day?''\n\nBirthday presents: John Krasinski took to his social media asking his followers for gifts despite one of his daughters forgetting that it was his special day\n\n'If you're one of those people who says, 'please no gifts on my birthday,' you and I are very different. Because I like gifts. I demand them. I'll go so far as to make you feel very awkward if you don't get me one. But lucky for you, I'm old school. I like cash. That Goodfellas style just put it right in a pillowcase kind of cash,' he said before showing a pink pillowcase with rainbows on it.\n\nHe went on to say that he 'stole' the pillowcase from his daughter's room when she revealed she forgot his birthday.\n\nJohn shares his two daughters Violet, aged three, and Hazel, aged five, with his wife and fellow actress Emily Blunt.\n\nKeeping it casual: John wore a black long sleeve t-shirt and maroon pants as he sat in front of two balloons that said the number 40 as he gave a call to action to all of his followers\n\nPillowcase: In the video, he held up one of his daughter's pillowcases and went on to explain that one of them forgot his birthday, although he didn't say which.\n\nBut before fans could pull out their wallets, he revealed that the gifts weren't for him but for the Family Reach organization that helps give financial aid to families who are affected by cancer.\n\n'My friends over at Venmo have created a pillowcase of sorts in an account called JKBday,' he went on to say.\n\n'So open up your hearts, open up your cyber wallets and make my birthday dreams come true.'\n\nLooking good: John took the stage at the Amazon Prime Video Takeover at New York Comic Con earlier this month\n\nBut one of The Office alum's famous costars didn't let their famous friend get away without some birthday wishes.\n\n'Omg Happy 40th JK! You have the biggest heart! Love you!' Angela Kinsey wrote on his Instagram.\n\nAfter the birthday shoutout, John took his mission a step further and tweeted his friend Ryan Reynolds asking for Hugh Jackman's phone number.\n\n'I hope to be reincarnated as Hugh's cell phone. Just so I can spend all g****** day cradled in his buttery-soft hands,' The Proposal star tweeted back.", "description": "John Krasinski is celebrating his 40th birthday today.
