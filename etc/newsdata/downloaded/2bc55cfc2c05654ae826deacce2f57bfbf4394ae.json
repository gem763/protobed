He claimed in a tweet that Saudi Arabia does not believe its own allegations that Iran was responsible for the attack on Saudi oil sites.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that even the Saudis themselves don\u2019t believe the fiction of Iranian involvement\u201d, Mr Zarif said, pointing to what he described as a Saudi retaliatory attack on Houthi forces in southwestern Yemen.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been at war with the Houthi rebels since March 2015. The UN, Gulf Arab nations and the US accuse Iran of supplying arms to the Houthis, something Tehran denies.\n\nAnalysts say the missiles used in the 14 September assault on oil sites wouldn\u2019t have enough range to reach the oil sites in eastern Saudi Arabia from impoverished Yemen. The missiles and drones used resembled Iranian-made weapons, although analysts say more study is needed to definitively link them to Iran.\n\nRead more\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s power is waning, leaving Trump to deal with Iran\n\nMr Salami added that Iran does not want to start a conflict, but appeared to warn the US and Saudi Arabia that Iran is prepared.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stop until the destruction of any aggressor. And we will not leave any secure spot,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not miscalculate and do not make a mistake.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump signalled on Friday that he was not inclined to authorise an immediate military strike on Iran in response to the attacks on the Saudi oil industry, saying he believes showing restraint \u201cshows far more strength\u201d and he wants to avoid a war.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nThe Pentagon said the US will deploy additional troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to beef up security.\n\nMr Trump, who withdrew the US from the nuclear deal more than a year ago, said separately on Friday that America \u201cjust sanctioned the Iranian national bank.\u201d He did not elaborate. The US Treasury Department said it took action against the Central Bank of Iran.\n\nIran\u2019s central bank chief, Abdolnasser Hemmati, attempted to shrug off the new sanctions on Saturday. According to the state-run IRNA news agency, Mr Hemmati said re-imposing sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank shows the US has little leverage left.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Netanyahu\u2019s power is waning, leaving Trump to deal with Iran", "description": "Iran has threatened \u201cthe full destruction of any aggressor\u201d after the Pentagon said the US would deploy additional troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the wake of attacks on major oil sites.Major General Hossein Salami told state media the Revolutionary Guard", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8UVqZnwlTL0lDPJnOLg_zA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/42c1281f3a8538df0b4ae098fc2988b7", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
