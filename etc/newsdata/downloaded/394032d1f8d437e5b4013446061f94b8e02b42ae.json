The 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage averaged 3.38%, the same as a week ago.\n\nMortgage rates roughly track the direction of the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -3.91%, the yield on which has fallen nearly 30% over the last five days.\n\nRecent data has fueled concerns that the American economy could be entering a slowdown. A report that gauges conditions in the services sector came in significantly weaker than was expected Thursday morning, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.47% lower. Other recent reports on private-sector employment and the manufacturing industry have also disappointed.\n\n\u2018As economic growth decelerates, it is clear that low mortgage rates will continue to support the mortgage market.\u2019 \u2014Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist\n\nA weaker economy alone would cause problems for the housing market \u2014 people are disinclined to buy a home if they\u2019re worried about their jobs or their bank accounts. But economists have argued that low mortgage rates could counteract this.\n\n\u201cWhile mortgage rates generally held steady this week, overall mortgage demand remained very strong,\u201d Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, said in the report. \u201cAs economic growth decelerates, it is clear that low mortgage rates will continue to support the mortgage market and we expect that to persist for the remainder of the year.\u201d\n\nLow rates are certainly bringing people back into the market who had been priced out \u2014 but scoring a deal on a home loan isn\u2019t necessarily the biggest consideration for a buyer. A recent report from Zillow ZG, +1.75% found that life events were behind 35% of buyers\u2019 choices to move, compared with just 21% of people who said they were moving because of dynamics in the market.\n\nOver two-thirds of renters are carrying some form of debt, according to Zillow.\n\nMoreover, high home prices are just one factor contributing to the affordability challenges many would-be buyers are facing. Over two-thirds of renters are carrying some form of debt, Zillow Z, +1.48% found, and nearly a third of Generation Z and millennial buyers said that their debt load caused them to be denied a mortgage. For these renters, as long as they continue to have large amounts of debt, it won\u2019t matter terribly much how low mortgage rates go.", "description": "Economists argue that low rates will continue to prop up the housing market as the economy slows down, but it\u2019s not clear how long that will last.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS584_hometo_ZG_20191003103644.jpg"}
