The large contingent of security officers working overtime cost the country over 7.4 million Euros ($8.2 million).\n\nOn Wednesday, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold tweeted out a copy of the two-page bill dated June 6 given to police by the Doonbeg resort.\n\nWhen @realdonaldtrump made a side trip to his Irish golf club this summer, dozens of Irish cops were sent to protect him. Then Trump\u2019s company charged the cops more than $100K for food and coffee.\n\nHere\u2019s the bill: pic.twitter.com/y9jWDPgM9s \u2014 David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) October 23, 2019\n\nAmong the charges were over 904,000 Euros ($1 million) for the accommodation and food provided to the guards, along with 14,000 Euros ($15,500) for snack bags distributed to police over five days.\n\nNotably, Fahrenthold highlights, police were charged 875 Euros ($975) for \u201cadditional tea and coffee due to inclement weather.\u201d\n\nTrump has previously stated that his resorts are easier for law enforcement to secure, a defense he has repeatedly used to justify his administration\u2019s stays at his resorts during overseas travel.\n\nVice President Mike Pence also stayed at the Doonbeg property during an official trip to Dublin, Ireland in September, a 180-mile detour that cost taxpayers nearly $600,000 in transportation fees.\n\nRead more: Ireland\u2019s prime minister denied Trump a photo op at his Irish golf course, report says, and met him in an airport lounge instead\n\nFollowing the visit, Senate Democrats began inquiring about the massive detour. Sen. Gary Peters, the ranking member of the Senate\u2019s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, sent a letter to Pence asking for clarification on the cost of his stay, including comparable rates of hotels closer to Dublin, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, alleging \u201copen corruption\u201d by the Trump administration.\n\nThe Irish resort was in the spotlight again earlier this month after Ireland approved the Trump Organization\u2019s plans to build over 50 homes and a new ballroom at the resort.\n\nOverall, Trump\u2019s properties both foreign and domestic \u2013 and the fact that he and other government officials stay at them \u2013 have led to questions about the emoluments clause in the Constitution. (Trump called the clause \u201cphony\u201d after he was criticized for a now-kaput plan to hold the G7 summit at one of his properties in Florida.)\n\nVox summarizes: \u201cThe foreign emoluments clause forbids the president from profiting off foreign governments, and the domestic emoluments clause limits the president\u2019s ability to profit off of either the federal government or a state government.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Trump's Irish resort slapped police hired for his June visit with a bill of over $100,000, including $975 for extra coffee and $15,000 for snacks..
