More costumes are being bought each year as the number of people participating in Halloween increases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Research by Hubbub estimated that 33 million people dressed up for Halloween in 2017 and a shocking four in 10 costumes were worn only once. This means it\u2019s vital that we all try and choose costumes that are as environmentally friendly as possible.\n\n\u2018Concerned consumers can take personal action to avoid buying new plastic and still dress up for Halloween by buying from charity shops or reusing costumes to create outfits, or making their own from non-plastic materials.\u2019\n\nThe most common plastic polymer found in the clothing sampled was polyester, making up 69% of the total of all materials (Picture: PA)\n\nTrewin Restorick, chief executive of Hubbub, which is working with the all-party parliamentary group looking into the environmental sustainability of the fashion industry, said: \u2018The amount of plastic waste from Halloween costumes is similar to the weight of plastic waste generated at Easter in egg-wrappings.\n\n\u2018However, the total plastic waste footprint of Halloween will be even higher once you take into account other Halloween plastic such as party kits and decorations, much of which are also plastic, or Halloween food packaging, most of which quickly becomes rubbish and, ultimately, breaks down to be plastic pollution.\n\n\u2018Retailers must take greater responsibility to offer ranges for seasonal celebrations that don\u2019t worsen the already worrying impact of plastic waste on our planet.\u2019\n\nPaula Chin, sustainable materials specialist at WWF, said: \u2018There is nothing scarier than our throwaway culture.\n\n\u2018By reducing the amount of plastic we buy, embracing reusable items and taking responsibility for our waste, we can make sure Halloween is suitably spooky and sustainable.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
