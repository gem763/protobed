We have to create an economy to keep the forest standing,\u201d he said, adding that the possibilities were \u201cendless\u201d and would benefit indigenous people too.\n\nNobre was the lead author of the IPCC report into climate change, which won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSome 42 international scientists drew up recommendations and compiled facts for the assembly or \u201csynod\u201d at the Vatican.\n\nThe Amazon\u2019s natural bounty \u2014 plants, bacteria, mosses, and lichens \u2014 could be used in the pharmaceutical, food or cosmetics sectors if investments were made in the creation of high-value bio-industries and technologies, they say.\n\nThe forest boasts acai berries (with medicinal properties), babassu palm trees (oil used in cosmetics), chestnuts and cocoa.\n\n\u2013 \u2018A revolution\u2019 \u2013\n\nStrict ecological standards could be set for the harvesting of such resources, while protecting the rights of local populations.\n\n\u201cFor a middle class to emerge in the Amazon, forest products need to be given added value,\u201d said Nobre, a guest at the assembly, which has called for more be done to protect the region\u2019s indigenous peoples.\n\n\u201cWe need an industrial and scientific revolution\u201d, he said.\n\nThe rainforest is home to between 10 and 15 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity.\n\nEnvironmental campaigner Pope Francis has long insisted on the inextricable link between humans and nature.\n\nThe assembly has heard from indigenous peoples and international experts on the fate of locals who are threatened \u2014 and sometimes murdered \u2014 by economic predators.\n\nFelicio de Araujo Pontes, a Brazilian prosecutor who specialises in defending indigenous peoples, criticised \u201ca colonialist mentality that persists with the idea of superiority over the people of the forest\u201d.\n\nHe slammed an economy based on intensive cattle breeding and soy cultivation, agreeing with fellow experts that \u201cfrom an economic point of view, it is worth keeping the forest standing\u201d.\n\nAmazon soy is widely used as feed for cattle, pigs and poultry.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Gold hunters, miners\u2019 \u2013\n\nBrazilian Archbishop Roque Paloschi said land grabbing had left some communities with nothing.\n\n\u201cThe 1988 constitution said that by 1993 all indigenous peoples\u2019 lands were to be defined, approved and registered.\n\n\u201cOne third of them were, the others were invaded by gold hunters, and mining, oil and timber industries,\u201d he said.\n\nNobre warned time was running out for the Amazon, which is spread over nine of the twelve countries of South America.\n\n\u201cScience shows we are very close to a point of no return,\u201d he said, adding that some \u201c60 to 70 percent of the Amazonian forest could disappear in the next 30 to 50 years\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe must slam the breaks on logging and achieve zero deforestation in the coming years. And we must fight global warming,\u201d said Nobre.\n\nSome 15 percent of the forest has already disappeared due to deforestation and fires, many of which are intentionally lit.", "description": "Vatican City (AFP) \u2013 Brazilian prize-winning climatologist Carlos Nobre is calling for a bioeconomic plan to save the Amazon by drawing on its", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/907f28_nobre-was-lead-author-ipcc-report-climate-change-won-2007-nobel-peace-prize-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
