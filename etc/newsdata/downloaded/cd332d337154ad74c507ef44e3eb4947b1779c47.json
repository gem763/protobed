And immediately, obviously, The New Yorker recognized that. And it is not accurate to say that it was not reportable. In fact, there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC.\u201d\n\nFarrow\u2019s blunt claim highlighted an uncomfortable debate among NBC News insiders, and beyond, concerning the quality and status of his investigative reporting and the reasons why a respected television network would kill a sensational scoop about a famous, influential, politically wired, and undeniably newsworthy figure like Harvey Weinstein.\n\nRumors about the iconic producer\u2019s alleged misconduct with women have fueled journalistic curiosity for decades. But the 65-year-old Weinstein somehow managed to keep his alleged misdeeds from public exposure\u2014until now.\n\nHe was supremely hooked up in the worlds of media, entertainment, and politics. (Former first daughter Malia Obama recently interned at the Weinstein Co.) He had enjoyed a long business relationship with NBC Universal, and Universal Pictures produced both his seven-Oscar Shakespeare in Love in 1998 and 2009\u2019s Inglourious Basterds, for instance, while he had co-produced the hit reality-TV show Project Runway for the NBC-owned Bravo channel.\n\nWhen it came to shaping his public image, Weinstein was at once meticulous and relentless\u2014forever calling in chits and wielding leverage like a weapon. He alternately flattered and bullied reporters (including this one), while occasionally attempting to entice journalists and gossip columnists with offers of book and movie deals.\n\nMore than a decade ago, when this reporter was doing a gossip column at the New York Daily News and politely declined Weinstein\u2019s request to kill an item about his recent divorce, he wheedled that he was my most loyal fan and had advised the paper\u2019s owner to give me a raise; when that didn\u2019t work, he angrily threatened to ban me from his screenings and premieres, and finally erupted: \u201cI\u2019m the scariest motherfucker you\u2019ll ever have as an enemy in this town!\u201d\n\nEven before Farrow\u2019s shot across NBC\u2019s bow, CNN anchor Jake Tapper, for one, tweeted: \u201cSpeaking of media complicity ask yourself why NBC reporter \u202a@ RonanFarrow wrote this for The New Yorker.\u201d\n\nNBC declined to respond officially to Tapper or to Farrow, a former MSNBC anchor and NBC correspondent whose four-year contract with the network recently expired.\n\nBut an NBC source promptly contradicted Farrow\u2019s late-night claim, telling The Daily Beast in a statement: \u201cRonan has had a non-exclusive relationship with NBC News for the last year. He brought NBC News early reporting [on Weinstein] that didn\u2019t meet the standard to go forward with a story; it was nowhere close to what ultimately ran in The New York Times or The New Yorker\u2014for example, at that time he didn\u2019t have one accuser willing to go on the record or identify themselves.\u201d\n\nThe NBC source continued: \u201cHe asked if he could bring it to a print outlet (presumably sources might be more willing to cooperate vs. going on camera), NBC agreed, with the understanding that if he got the story published he would come back and talk about it. The story he published is radically different than what he brought to NBC News.\u201d\n\nMonths ago, however, the 29-year-old Farrow, a lawyer and member of the New York Bar, did indeed secure for his investigation an incriminating audio recording made by the New York Police Department in March 2015 and which now accompanies Farrow\u2019s article on The New Yorker\u2019s website. It\u2019s essentially a sting tape for which the Special Victims Unit had wired 22-year-old Filipina-Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who\u2019d formally complained to the cops that he\u2019d groped her breast and tried to put his hand up her skirt the previous day, and sent her to meet the movie mogul at the Tribeca Grand Hotel.\n\nAfter initially refusing Weinstein\u2019s invitation to join him in his hotel room\u2014and resisting his entreaties to come in, sit down, and have a drink while he took a shower\u2014Gutierrez had a fraught back-and-forth with Weinstein on tape as she asked him why he\u2019d groped her breasts.\n\n\u201cOh, please, I\u2019m sorry, just come on in,\u201d Weinstein answered, in The New Yorker\u2019s account. \u201cI\u2019m used to that. Come on. Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re used to that?\u201d Gutierrez asked, disbelieving.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Weinstein said. In an apparent admission, he added, \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\nThe cops were thwarted in their attempt to question Weinstein when he demanded his lawyer, and in the end, no charges were filed.\n\nIronically, despite the fact that NBC News had access to the recording for several months and certainly could have used it as part of Farrow\u2019s report, both NBC and MSNBC were at pains on Tuesday to credit The New Yorker in their repeated replays of the bombshell tape.\n\nAnd despite his public row with the powers that be, Farrow was booked on the Today show Wednesday along with MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, to discuss his 8,000-word New Yorker article, which landed with a bang on the magazine\u2019s website Tuesday morning, and immediately dominated television coverage.\n\nFarrow also was booked for appearances on ABC\u2019s World News Tonight, Nightline, and Good Morning America, the CBS Evening News, the PBS NewsHour, CNN, and NPR.\n\nSources inside and outside NBC, meanwhile, challenged the network\u2019s assertion that Farrow had obtained no usable on-the-record, on-camera interviews with Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims. By several accounts, at least eight women claiming to have been sexually harassed, abused, or assaulted by Weinstein had agreed to go on camera\u2014most of them anonymously in shadow, but two alleged victims with their names and faces. A third alleged victim was willing to allow her name to be used, but not her on-camera image, according to sources, and at least two of the women who spoke to NBC News ultimately ended up in The New Yorker piece.\n\nThose claims, however, were heatedly contradicted by other network insiders, who said Farrow had not arranged a sufficient number of usable on-camera interviews with Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims, especially on-the-record interviews, to produce a story that could legitimately be broadcast by a major television network. Meanwhile, it was decided that the sting tape, absent context, could not be the basis for a stand-alone story.\n\nSources said Rose McGowan, a well-known actress who went before NBC\u2019s cameras in January to describe how Weinstein allegedly forced sex on her years ago, was compelled to withdraw her participation because it could have a provoked a lawsuit and threatened a non-disclosure agreement and financial settlement she\u2019d made with the powerful and litigious co-chairman of the Weinstein Company.\n\nWithout identifying McGowan by name, Farrow\u2019s article reported: \u201c One actress who initially spoke to me on the record later asked that her allegation be removed. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018The legal angle is coming at me and I have no recourse.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to a television-industry insider familiar with Farrow\u2019s NBC News project, however, \u201cFarrow and his producer had been working this for 10 months. They had eight interviews on camera, with a mix of silhouette and not-silhouette\u2014so eight women speaking. They had an NYPD audio tape, and they had enough for a story. And NBC did everything they could to delay it, complicate it, and ultimately Noah [Oppenheim] killed it. NBC shut it down.\u201d\n\nThis person continued: \u201cIt is what it is, and everybody can see it. It\u2019s crazy. There\u2019s no reason, journalistically, for the story to have been killed. Obviously, there was some other reason\u2014and I don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d\n\nBy the time Farrow pitched New Yorker Editor in Chief David Remnick in August, according to multiple sources, he and NBC News investigative unit producer Rich McHugh, among others, had been pursuing Weinstein\u2019s alleged serial groping\u2014and worse\u2014of young actresses and female staffers since the previous December.\n\nOver the course of several months, scripts were prepared and vetted, and Farrow\u2019s and McHugh\u2019s reporting was subjected to various layers of both fact-checking and legal reviews, insiders said, and at one point a senior producer on NBC News\u2019 Friday night show Dateline carefully re-interviewed many of their sources and witnesses, and concluded they were solid.\n\nThe vetting process lasted weeks and weeks, through much of the summer, but ended shortly after Kimberley D. Harris, executive vice president and general counsel of NBC Universal, subjected the material to her own review. Since Harris oversees the in-house lawyering of all the company divisions, an NBC source said it would not be unusual for her to review news division material for potential exposure to litigation. And although Harris reports to NBC Universal Chief Executive Steve Burke, a source insisted Burke wasn\u2019t involved in the decision to spike the Weinstein story.\n\nIndeed, according to this account, Harris never formally weighed in, because NBC News had already pulled the plug by the time she finished examining Farrow\u2019s work.\n\nWith two such wildly contradictory versions of why and how NBC News spiked Farrow\u2019s Weinstein story, it\u2019s difficult to determine what objectively occurred.\n\nBut author and New Yorker media writer Ken Auletta, who has been covering Weinstein for decades and is among the legions of journalists who\u2019ve tried and failed to document his casting-couch behavior, also sat for an NBC interview; at one point, according to witnesses, he turned to the camera and declared: \u201cThis evidence is so overwhelming that if NBC News sits on it, that will be a scandal.\u201d", "description": "Inside and outside NBC, sources are challenging the network\u2019s take on the bombshell it missed. \u2018NBC did everything they could to delay it, complicate it, and ultimately [kill] it.\u2019", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1507717814/171010-toure-farrow-nbc-tease_wn7s0e", "published_at": "2017-10-11"}
