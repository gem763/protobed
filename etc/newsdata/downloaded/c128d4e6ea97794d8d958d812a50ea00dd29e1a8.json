Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe move aligns with the healthcare industry's push toward value-based care (VBC), an alternative reimbursement model that ties provider payments to patient outcomes rather than the number of services provided a la the traditional fee-for-service model.\n\nThe Palo Alto VA is looking to leverage Verily's data expertise to better address the needs of patients with high-priority conditions, such as those who are undergoing knee replacement surgeries, managing alcohol withdrawal, or who have suffered a heart attack. Meanwhile, Atrius Health aims to identify interventions to help better manage patients with heart failure in hopes of avoiding costly ER visits or additional hospitalizations.\n\nVBC could be the future of healthcare reimbursement \u2014 and Verily is setting itself up to facilitate providers' transition to this payment model. Large insurers are bullish on VBC despite lags in provider adoption, indicating that the model is likely here to stay.\n\nUnitedHealthcare is one of several major insurers chasing ambitious growth targets for VBC: It announced last year that it aims to cover 150 million people under VBC arrangements by 2025, 10 times the number of people it covered under VBC in 2018. But lukewarm provider adoption has slowed VBC's healthcare takeover, with only 25% of revenue for healthcare organizations estimated to have come from VBC reimbursement in 2018, per an Optum-sponsored survey.\n\nNevertheless, OptumHealth \u2014 a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group and sister company to UnitedHealthcare \u2014 enjoyed a 34% year-over-year leap in revenue, which UnitedHealth attributed in part to strong performance from VBC arrangements.\n\nAnd Verily can lean on Google's data science know-how to address providers' pain points and nab more partnerships in the future. One hurdle to VBC adoption among providers is the fact that it requires sophisticated data collection, analysis, and reporting tools that many hospitals might not be capable of managing on their own.\n\nAnd the majority of payers agree, with nearly 60% saying that providers lack the tools they need to succeed under VBC. Verily has an opportunity to bridge the gap between the complex healthcare payments ecosystem its potential partners are working in and big tech's digital expertise.\n\nBut Verily isn't the only player looking to reduce technological barriers to VBC adoption. UnitedHealth Group's Optum and Altais \u2014 a new spinout from Blue Shield of California \u2014 are both working in a similar capacity, supplying providers with digital tools and infrastructure improvements to enable greater cost-savings via VBC over time.\n\nThe success of Verily's Atrius and the Palo Alto VA partnerships could be critical for the organization's ability to persuade future partners of the positive impact a data-driven approach to healthcare can have not only on insurers' bottom lines, but on patient health outcomes as well.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
