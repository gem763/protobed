While the members of Congress could not disclose details of the whistleblower complaint, several said that it was cause for concern.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cHaving read the documents in there, I\u2019m even more worried about what happened than when I read the memorandum of the conversation,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. \u201cThere are so many facts that have to be examined. It\u2019s very troubling.\u201d\n\nSchumer called for the report to be made public.\n\nRep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) summarized to CNN the complaint in one word: \u201cdisturbing.\u201d He added that the complaint was \u201cextraordinarily detailed\u201d and \u201cvery, very well done.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt reinforces the concerns that what we previously learned and I think it is a blueprint for what we still need to know,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cIt lays out exactly what congress needs to investigate.\u201d\n\nThe delivery of the whistleblower complaint to the Hill comes the same day the White House released a transcript of President Donald Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president that confirmed the president requested investigation into Joe Biden and his son. Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire and intelligence inspector general Michael Atkinson are both expected to testify on the Hill Thursday. The release of the complaint comes after initial resistance from the Trump administration.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters after reading the complaint that \u201cthe administration ought not be attacking the whistleblower as some talking points suggest they plan to do\u201d and that no one should rush to conclusions.\n\n\u201cThere are real troubling things here: Republicans ought not just circle the wagons, and Democrats ought not be using words like \u2018impeach\u2019 before they knew anything about the actual substance,\u201d Sasse said.\n\n\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters after reviewing the complaint that he looked forward to receiving more information from Maguire and Atkinson and going from there.\n\n\u201cI think, first of all, in this particular case, there\u2019s not going to be that much information to have to put together, I think that argues for some patience to do that,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cI think being able to ask them questions, look at two different points of view of this, and I think also at some point very quickly, we need to talk to the Justice Department.\u201d\n\nAndrew Desiderio contributed to this report.", "description": "Schumer called for the report to be made public.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/18/a8/6bcf15c248b9bbda25e68c3556e5/190925-schumer-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
