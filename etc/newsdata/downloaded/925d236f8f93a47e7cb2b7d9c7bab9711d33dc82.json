There\u2019s not much to it: I like to know what\u2019s happening around me even when I\u2019m listening to music and podcasts. But over the weekend, I accidentally discovered that for all these years I\u2019ve been doing it wrong \u2014 and chances are that so have you.\n\nApparently, most phones have a setting specifically designed for optimizing your audio for listening from one earbud only \u2014 mono audio. This setting is also particularly helpful to people with hearing disabilities that affect only one of their ears.\n\nAnyways, here\u2019s how you turn on mono audio.\n\nMono audio on iPhone\n\nThis is pretty simple on iOS.\n\nHead to Settings > General > Accessibility, and you\u2019ll see the mono audio setting there. Toggle it on and you\u2019re done.\n\nMono audio on Android\n\nWe\u2019ve got a little problem here. Since most manufacturers customize Android, how you turn on mono audio will vary across devices.\n\nNo worries, though, most brands keep that setting in the Accessibility menu \u2014 so as long as you can find it, you should be fine.\n\nI\u2019m currently using a Huawei P30 Pro, and the Accessibility menu is hidden inside the Smart assistance tab in settings. And boom \u2014 the mono audio setting is right there.\n\nSamsung\u2019s One UI, on the other hand, has a dedicated Accessibility menu in Settings. Head there, and you\u2019ll find the mono audio setting in the Hearing tab.\n\nAnyways, you get the idea. Find the Accessibility menu and you\u2019ll work out the rest.\n\nThat\u2019s about it.\n\nNow stick one earbud in your soundholes and let us know if it makes a difference down in the comments.\n\nRead next: CHEAP: My favorite true wireless earbuds have 31% off \u2014 go get 'em", "description": "Do you often listen to music and podcasts with only one earbud in your ears?
