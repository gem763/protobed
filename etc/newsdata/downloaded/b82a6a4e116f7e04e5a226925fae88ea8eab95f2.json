You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThose mezzes form many of the highlights of the two meals I've eaten there. Panir sabzi, a Persian menu mainstay, is more of a spreadable white cheese than the usual crumbly feta, saltier than you might expect but perfectly paired with the bazaar bread.\n\nIn fact, it seems like the menu has been designed with the bread in mind, working backwards after the team tasted it. It's a remarkably light, crispy, and at the same time substantial baton that is freshly baked to order and arrives warm to the table. Order at least one per person. There will be no regrets.\n\nYou\u2019ll need the bread for the smokey aubergine \u2013 kashk e bademjan, essentially, though less creamy than most versions you might have tried \u2013 and the mast o-khiar, tzatziki\u2019s more sour, arguably more delicious cousin.\n\nThe sambusach proves that the smart touches at the bread oven also extend to the fryer, with one of the lighter samosas you\u2019re going to find; the casing dissolves on your tongue like a prawn cracker.\n\nWith a pastry so fine, it\u2019s a slight shame the filling isn\u2019t a touch punchier, though the potato inside at least gives enough of a contrast in textures to keep eating it interesting.\n\nWhile the focus does seem to be on the mezze dishes, it would be unfair to say Nutshell doesn\u2019t hold its own when it comes to what you might consider the mains, presented here in sections by stove and grill.\n\nJoosh pareh is the pick of the dishes from the stove, excellent beef dumplings in a sour cherry broth, bobbing along next to satisfyingly al dente chickpeas. Jojeh kebab is barbecued poussin, rather than a mature chicken, and has the appropriate tenderness. It\u2019s a thrilling combination of lemon and saffron, and the accompanying yoghurt elevates it into the superb tier of grilled birds.\n\nThe octopus is along the same piquant lines, a decent-sized tentacle served with tart white beans and a sabzi (herb) salsa. It rivals the poussin for flavour and texture, but comes in at a punchy \u00a316.50, which doesn\u2019t present nearly the same value. In fact, prices generally let you know you\u2019re in a central London restaurant.\n\nI\u2019d possibly advise skipping the chelo rice. The best rice in Persian restaurants, or Persian dining tables in general features enough butter so as to make Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s mash potato recipe look like a health food. The version here is a bit too tame. Go for the aforementioned bread instead.\n\nAnd make sure you save room for dessert. The zulbia (aka jalebi) is possibly the star of the show. Rather than being soaked in syrup and orange food colouring it\u2019s presented in its naked form; rings of deep fried batter to be dipped into the pot of delicious fig cream.\n\nSharing menu bills have a tendency to escalate out of control, particularly when you\u2019re advised to get a few plates between you, and that can be the case here.\n\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind, though, how different it feels to eat in a new restaurant in zone 1 and it not be a chain, or a chain import, or the extension of another restaurant group. It\u2019s remarkable how noteworthy it is, and here\u2019s hoping Nutshell succeeds as a result.\n\nFood \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nService \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nValue \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nNutshell, 30 St Martin's Lane, Charing Cross, London WC2N 4 ER; 02034 097926; open Sat-Mon; nutshelllondon.co.uk", "description": "Persian cuisine is one of those that tends to be pigeon-holed: by location, usually in west London; and by menu, which never veers far from kebabs and stews.\u00a0 Nutshell has gone slightly against the grain by opening slap bang in the middle of the city, nestled near two landmarks in their own right in the London Coliseum and the Chandos pub on St Martin\u2019s Lane.\u00a0 The menu", "authors": ["Ibrahim Salha"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/10/nutshell-interior.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
