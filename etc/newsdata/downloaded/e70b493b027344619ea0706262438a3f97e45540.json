That's because fund flows aren't responding to the rising sharemarket as they have in the past.\n\nFlat flows\n\nOver the last two years, Buckland said in his presentation, net flows into equity funds are flat while passive investment strategies are capturing more capital.\n\nA flurry of deals and a flood of cash into the sharemarket are two clear signs that the bull market is nearing the end. But this \"euphoria\" simply isn't there, and that suggests to Buckland that sharemarkets are not massively overvalued.\n\nSo markets could still run, but investors are getting mixed messages. The dreaded inverted yield curve, for instance, is indicating a recession may be looming and that would hit equity market returns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo investors will have to make their own minds up as to whether to heed the warning of the inverted yield curve, or wait for a clearer signal of sharemarket excess.\n\nThe other head-scratching issue for the active fund managers is that markets are behaving very differently.\n\nAs Ian Heslop, the head of global equities at London-based Merian Global Investors showed, for the last 16 years, investors have tended to make money from buying cheap, high-quality companies, and selling or avoiding expensive, poor quality ones.\n\nDash for trash\n\nBut since March 2018, that has not worked at all in the US. Investors have been rewarded for buying \"expensive\" poor-quality equities, and punished for buying cheaper stocks that screen for quality factors.\n\nInstitutional investors have to determine whether this is a medium-term aberration, or if they have to change the way they think about markets.\n\nThe same applies to value managers. As has been discussed a \"value\" strategy of buying cheap stocks and selling expensive ones has failed miserably for the last five years.\n\nHeslop is not convinced it's the right time to bet on the value factor coming good. He believes \"value\" stocks are cheap because they're risky, and the market simply does not have the risk appetite at this stage to bid up these stocks.\n\nAnd, he argues, that so long as interest rates remain low, the valuation of stocks that seem expensive can potentially be justified, implying \"value\" may struggle.\n\nAnd with large corporates less willing to take advantage of cheap funding to do deals, it seems interest rates may actually be a better barometer of capital markets' welfare than sharemarket indices.", "description": "Brokers and fund managers aren't enjoying the decade long bull market: bankers aren't getting paid, and fund flows aren't responding to the rising sharemarket.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_37/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5ec4c62e9be240669f94264b7ee6407dbf831a5a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
