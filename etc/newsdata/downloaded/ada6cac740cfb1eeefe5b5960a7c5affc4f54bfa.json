Rick Scott (R-FL), the National Republican Congressional Committee, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), according to the WSJ.\n\nThey are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia on Thursday. Both are being represented by John Dowd, the former head of Trump\u2019s White House legal team.\n\nThe two men are reportedly both clients of Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and had separately assisted him in efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the WSJ. The two men are reportedly born in former Soviet republics, but which ones have not been specified.\n\nThe WSJ report cites information from a Soros-funded group, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), alleging that the men had dinner with the president in May 2018 and later that month met with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe two men reportedly introduced Giuliani to several current and former senior Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss Biden\u2019s case beginning late 2018, and House Democrats have sought documents and depositions from them since last month.\n\nThe WSJ also reported that Parnas and Fruman allegedly worked to oust the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed from her post earlier this year.\n\nThe paper also reported that both men told the Soros-funded group OCCRP that they told Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) that Yovanovitch was bad-mouthing Trump, and Sessions reportedly asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for her removal. Sessions did not confirm that to the WSJ.\n\nOn Thursday, House Democrats subpoenaed the men to appear before Congress in their impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Two Florida businessmen were arrested late Wednesday on violating campaign finance rules stemming from donations to Republicans.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Lev-Parnas-Igor-Fruman-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
