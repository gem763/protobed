Malavenda's message is that unchallenged control of Onondaga's government has prevented the county and its urban center, Syracuse, from thriving.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile Onondaga County has 109,733 registered Democrats to 82,675 Republicans, and includes the traditionally blue academics and youths connected to Syracuse University, it has long been an upstate Republican stronghold. With the GOP seeking to recover from the blows it suffered in last year's state Senate elections, the contest in Central New York could be an early test for new state chair Nick Langworthy and his allies.\n\nMalavenda, a Syracuse native, said his bid for elected office is an outgrowth of his years of dissatisfaction with what he called \u201cpay-to-play, gerrymandering and crony-ism\u201d in the county. Nothing he has seen since becoming a candidate has caused him to reconsider.\n\n\u201cI thought I was cynical before, but then I started running and I realized I just can\u2019t keep up,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cI came out of the sewer business and I feel like I went down a level.\u201d\n\nThe county's GOP establishment seems to be less than flustered by a determined challenger with an atypical amount of resources.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got street credit,\u201d McMahon said during an interview in his 14th floor office in Syracuse, lit by broad windows looking out on the city's downtown and the rolling Central New York hills where his rural constituents live.\n\nThe county's Democrats helped boost the House candidacy of Dana Balter, who ultimately lost to GOP incumbent Rep. John Katko in a competitive race in 2018. The county has been represented in the state Senate for years by both a Republican and Democrat \u2014 currently Sens. Bob Antonacci and Rachel May, respectively.\n\nBut at the very local level, Republicans have firmly held the reins of county government for decades thanks to strong leadership, its influence in the county\u2019s towns and villages, and a relatively large enrollment in the Independence and Conservative parties. The last Democrat elected to countywide office was former district attorney Bob Wildridge in the 1980s. A Democrat has never been elected comptroller or executive.\n\nMcMahon, 39, is a product of the GOP organization. He has spent more than 14 years in elected office and was quickly appointed from chair of the county legislature to temporarily replace executive Joanie Mahoney when she stepped down last year. Mahoney was successful in pushing economic development in the region through close ties with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, but was also known for tense relationships with former Syracuse mayor Stephanie Miner, a Democrat, as well as Republican county leaders.\n\nMcMahon said he has strong alliances on both sides of the aisle from his time as city councilor and legislator, and has touted his record in fighting poverty in the county. Although Syracuse remains one of the nation\u2019s poorest cities with a 30.5 percent poverty rate, that figure dropped by 2 percent last year to the lowest in a decade. Unemployment in the city \u2014 at 3.9 percent \u2014 is trending down, he says, because the city is adding more jobs.\n\nThe county\u2019s books are balanced (it ran a surplus last year), its credit ratings are high, and McMahon said he and Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh, an independent, are bringing together academia, elected officials and the business community to benefit the city.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re getting along and sending those signals to everyone else, the private sector is willing to invest,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s important to voters, not his party affiliation, he says.\n\n\u201cOur folks aren\u2019t these partisan residents. If they were, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said.\n\nMalavenda doesn\u2019t entirely disagree. His outrage isn\u2019t so much based on party as it is on what he sees as a complacent status quo that works against Syracuse\u2019s revitalization. He said he has seen other distressed cities \u2014 Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, even Buffalo \u2014 rebuild their populations and reputations. But Syracuse has never been able to mount a steady recovery from the exodus of manufacturing jobs that began in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cSurvival of the fittest means survival of the species that can best adapt to change,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause this government is so locked in \u2014 doing the things the way they\u2019ve always done it, and keeping everybody there and in power \u2014 we have not adapted here. And that is, I think, the biggest question.\u201d\n\nMalavenda, 63, isn\u2019t a typical system disrupter. His only campaign experience was a failed run for county legislature as 27-year-old in 1983. He graduated from Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service and briefly studied international relations at the London School of Economics. He moved back to Syracuse before completing his masters, after he was recruited by a childhood friend to work on sewer systems. He did that for four decades.\n\nHe and his friend sold their company, Duke\u2019s Root Control, last December. Malavenda won\u2019t say how much he sold the company for, but it\u2019s enough that he had no trouble doubling his initial contribution of $400,000 to his campaign when he realized he needed more resources to keep up with McMahon.\n\nThe job of county executive essentially entails running a business, he said, and working in infrastructure gave him experience in coordinating a range of services. Malavenda has poured funding into attack ads on McMahon\u2019s rise to power and the money and party connections that cleared the way for him.\n\nAs of earlier this month, McMahon \u2018s campaign has raised more than $700,000 from individuals, firms, unions and others. Malavenda, who has raised a little over $60,000, said that without his own money there\u2019s no way he or anyone else could keep up \u2014 \u201cnot in this town.\u201d\n\nHe has leveled serious accusations against McMahon, claiming that he was involved in a ponzi scheme, which McMahon has vigorously denied. The charge was made in a television ad, leading a lawyer for McMahon to demand that local television stations stop running the ad or risk a libel suit.\n\nThe aggressive campaign could backfire on Malavenda, said Grant Reeher, the director of the Campbell Public Affairs Institute and a professor of political science at Syracuse University.\n\nSome of the ads have misconstrued McMahon\u2019s influence and ties with those of his predecessor, according to The Post-Standard. And they include little specific policy to persuade voters that what they have isn\u2019t working. Criticisms of pay raises and the compensation paid to county officials have been raised in previous elections and haven't gained much traction, he said.\n\n\u201cHe [McMahon] is keen on making his own mark and I think he\u2019s in a very good position to do so,\u201d Reeher said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big reason to send him packing.\u201d\n\nStill, the opposition from Malavenda is enough that McMahon has launched response ads, signaling that some of the accusations may have hit a mark with voters. And Langworthy, the state GOP chair, held an event at the county\u2019s Republican headquarters on Oct. 23 to defend McMahon.\n\n\u201cYou have a county executive that is standing for reelection and running on his record,\u201d Langworthy said.\u201cYou have one candidate who decided he was going to take this race to the toilet.\"\n\n\u201cI think the only thing people know about him is that he doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d McMahon said.\n\nWhile neither candidate is shying from a fight, there is one divisive topic they\u2019re happy to leave out of the campaign discussion.\n\n\"What do you think about Trump?\" asked a woman at a meet and greet with about a dozen residents at Valley Vista Apartments in Syracuse.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d the facility\u2019s event coordinator said. \"We\u2019re not doing that. They are running for the county, not the country.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates bumped fists.\n\n\u201cHe [Malavenda] looked at me and smirked,\u201d McMahon said later. \u201cThat was probably the nicest moment we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are also challenging GOP incumbents for district attorney, comptroller and county clerk.
