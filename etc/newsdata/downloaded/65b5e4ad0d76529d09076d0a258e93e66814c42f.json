Lawmakers and the president still have to agree on a dozen spending bills this fall. (J. David Ake/AP)\n\nCongress is arguing over federal spending again. Here\u2019s why.\n\nThe new fiscal year for the federal government starts Oct. 1. Congress and the president reached a big bipartisan spending deal this summer, but they have yet to enact any of the dozen spending bills required to fund government operations.\n\nNeither party right now seems interested in repeating last winter\u2019s historic 35-day partial government shutdown. To keep the federal government open beyond Oct. 1, bipartisan majorities in the House and the Senate have both passed a short-term funding bill to keep the government afloat until just before Thanksgiving. The White House has signaled that the president is likely to sign the stopgap measure into law.\n\nBut that\u2019s just a Band-Aid fix. Lawmakers and the president still have to agree on a dozen spending bills this fall that run the gamut from funding the military to protecting the environment, and negotiations will proceed in the shadow of an impeachment inquiry. Here\u2019s what you need to know about these coming battles.\n\n1. You can\u2019t divide a pie until you know how big it\u2019s going to be.\n\nCongress lately has routinely struggled to fund the federal government on the timeline required by the Congressional Budget Act. Last year was a bright spot: President Trump signed five of a dozen spending measures into law before the deadline.\n\nWhy is Congress moving so much more slowly this year?\n\nWhen lawmakers started writing appropriations bills last year, Congress and the president had already set the overall size of the discretionary budget. That gave Congress a head start in divvying up the pie across thousands of federal programs.\n\nThis year, the parties did not agree on new spending caps until just before the summer recess. Rather than waiting for the parties to agree on the size of the pie, the House just assumed higher spending limits and started writing individual bills. In contrast, the Senate opted to do little until after Congress had agreed on how big the pie would be. That\u2019s why \u2014 just days before the start of the fiscal year next week \u2060 \u2014 the House has passed 10 spending bills that it will probably need to pare back; meanwhile, the Senate hasn\u2019t passed any.\n\n2. The parties face new incentives under a divided government.\n\nDemocrats regained control of the House this year. Still, a sizable bloc of Republican lawmakers refused to vote for their party\u2019s bills when they controlled the chamber, either because they favored less federal spending or because they thought the bills weren\u2019t conservative enough. As a result, Democrats retained some leverage over spending bills even when they were in the minority.\n\n[Why are so many Republicans silent about the Ukraine whistleblower scandal? This one chart explains.]\n\nHouse Democrats face new challenges in the majority. Some rank-and-file Democrats want their party to take more progressive positions in spending negotiations. In April, because of disagreements within the caucus, party leaders canceled a vote in the House on the party\u2019s preferred overall spending levels. And although members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus generally supported last week\u2019s stopgap spending bill to keep the lights on until November, we may see more intraparty conflict over how strongly the party should oppose border wall funding later this fall.\n\nDemocrats also need to show voters they can be trusted to govern now that they control one chamber of Congress. When they were in the minority over the past two years, Democrats could accept whatever policy wins they were able to extract and then focus on contrasting their goals with Republicans\u2019 actions. Now, they need to prove they can deliver results.\n\n3. Order matters.\n\nCongress sped up the process last year by combining some of the individual bills into \u201cminibuses,\u201d multi-bill packages that allow different factions get something from each vote. For instance, minibuses last year allowed Congress to pair the defense bill with funding for the departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and Labor. That way, leaders ensured both parties would get their top priorities funded. House Democrats are game to package bills again. But Senate Democrats reportedly want to hold back the Pentagon funding bill so that they can use it as leverage in negotiations over the rest of the spending bills.\n\n[This is why the Congressional budget process is broken]\n\n4. One person\u2019s poison pill is another\u2019s happy pill.\n\nThe bipartisan spending deal reached this summer included language that stopped lawmakers from adding new \u201cpolicy riders\u201d to spending bills this year unless those riders have bipartisan support.\n\nSpending bills often contain riders, which can restrict how agencies spend federal funds. Some riders are politically contentious. Both parties often demand \u201cpoison pill\u201d riders as the price for their votes, knowing the rider would be a deal-killer for the other party.\n\nDemocrats may introduce controversial riders that would prevent Trump from moving funding to build a barrier along the southwestern border. Last year, Trump\u2019s refusal to sign a bill that did not contain at least $5 billion in wall funding led to a shutdown. He has requested the same amount this year. If Congress refuses to go along, he has threatened to continue to transfer money away from military construction projects to fund construction, as he has been doing this year. House Democrats want to add riders to one or more of the spending bills that would limit such transfers. Republicans, however, argue that the July deal against poison pills protects the president\u2019s ability to move money around.\n\nDemocrats want to introduce a number of new riders that Republicans are likely to reject. For instance, they want to add a rider to block the Trump administration from implementing a rule limiting what certain federally funded health-care providers can tell patients about abortion. Riders like these would have been hard sells in a final deal even had the parties not shook hands on a deal to avoid poison pills, but they will still be a source of conflict in coming budget negotiations.\n\nAs one House Democrat recently described the overall situation: \u201cNobody wants a shutdown. But what do you do when you\u2019re so far apart?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss anything! Sign up to get TMC\u2019s smart analysis in your inbox, three days a week.\n\nMolly E.
