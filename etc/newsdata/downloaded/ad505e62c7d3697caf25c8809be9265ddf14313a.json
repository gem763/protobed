A Democrat will express concern about the ability of the government to stop Russians from targeting Democratic presidential candidates in 2020.\n\nA strange role reversal has occurred. For decades, when intelligence agencies and their operations were publicly denounced, Republicans invoked national security concerns and leapt to their defense. The Democrats were the civil libertarians, dragging secret surveillance into the disinfecting light of day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow a Republican president and his defenders hurl accusations against intelligence agents and agencies while Democrats scurry to defend the former leadership of the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency (NSA). In this reversal, Democrats remain so focused on the battle lines of 2016 that we risk missing the real dangers of potential surveillance abuse under the current president.\n\nIt has become a GOP talking point that the intelligence practice of \u201cunmasking\u201d was used by the Obama administration to persecute Republicans. Unmasking is the practice of revealing to a government official the identity of an American citizen or resident caught up incidentally in surveillance of foreigners. Some likely unmasking victims cited by Republicans are former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump campaign consultant Carter Page, whose connections to Moscow raised suspicions at the FBI long before the agency began monitoring his actions during the 2016 presidential campaign. Republicans charge that warrantless surveillance and unmaskings were performed for purely political surveillance.\n\nRather than adopt a defensive clutch when Republicans raise such suspicions, Democrats should accept that bet \u2014 and raise it. Congressional Democrats should investigate how the Trump administration itself might be misusing surveillance. The surveillance practices about which Republicans purport to be so concerned are mushrooming. According to a national intelligence report, unmaskings of American citizens and residents have almost doubled, from just above 9,000 in 2015-2016 under President Obama to almost 17,000 in 2018 under President Trump.\n\nAre Democratic members of Congress among the unmasked? What about Democratic House or Senate staffers? Are Democratic candidates for president or some of their staff members being surveilled because their views on Iran or other issues differ from those of President Trump?\n\nIn short, Democrats would do well to remember it was our party that exposed the Nixon administration when it allowed the CIA to go against its charter and conduct warrantless surveillance of U.S. journalists and government officials. That same administration unleashed dozens of operatives to disrupt Democratic campaigns. Democratic history is not pure \u2014 the Kennedys famously spied on Martin Luther King Jr. and President Lyndon Johnson used the CIA to spy on GOP presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. But the tradition of exposing covert abuses became a hallmark of the Democratic Party, from Watergate to the Church Committee probe of the CIA, to the investigations of Iran-Contra.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRevelations from the Nixon investigations prompted the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) to introduce measures to create a legal framework for intelligence activities. That bill, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), was considered landmark legislation when President Jimmy Carter Jimmy CarterJimmy Carter leaves the hospital to recover from fall at home The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Diplomat's 'powerful' testimony and 'lynching' attract headlines The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump faces backlash for comparing impeachment to 'lynching' MORE signed it into law in 1978.\n\nFISA was a great improvement over the lawlessness that preceded it. But in a digital age, FISA has the potential for intelligence agencies and law enforcement to easily use foreign intelligence for backdoor domestic surveillance. Government surveillance now is armed with artificial intelligence capable of analyzing metadata based on our calls, emails and other digital traffic.\n\nHow should Democrats respond in the face of rising surveillance danger?\n\nFirst, Democrats should get behind Sen. Patrick Leahy Patrick Joseph LeahyOvernight Energy: Interior sees rise in revenue from drilling on public lands | Officials propose easing pesticide rule for farms | Trump prepares to formally leave Paris climate deal Democrats ask appropriators to block funding for USDA move Trump says remark about Colorado border wall was made 'kiddingly' MORE (D-Vt.) who is cosponsoring reforms with Republican Mike Lee Michael (Mike) Shumway LeeSenate votes for North Macedonia to join NATO Zuckerberg launches public defense of Facebook as attacks mount Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Pence says Turkey agrees to ceasefire | Senators vow to move forward with Turkey sanctions | Mulvaney walks back comments tying Ukraine aid to 2016 probe MORE of Utah. The Lee-Leahy bill would end bulk collection of Americans\u2019 data, strengthen protections and transparency, and curb surveillance overreach while protecting national security.\n\nSecond, Democrats should use congressional power to investigate what the Trump administration is up to regarding surveillance.\n\nFinally, we shouldn\u2019t let the Trump administration distract us from our core beliefs. We should retrieve our mojo on civil liberties and stop reflexively defending the alphabet agencies simply because this time it is not our ox being gored. We must remember our party\u2019s distinguished heritage by uniformly protecting privacy and freedom against government surveillance before, during and after Trump\u2019s tenure.", "description": "Democrats should back the Lee-Leahy bill that would end bulk collection of Americans\u2019 data, strengthen protections and curb surveillance overreach.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/schiffadam_pelosinancy_10242019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
