They follow below:\n\n\u201cI rarely actually tweet, especially about politics \u2013 am more of the silent retweeter \u2013 but after the chilling scenes in Parliament last night I just don\u2019t think I can stay quiet anymore. There\u2019s a group of young people and children that need to be spoken for.\n\n\u201cThe language used by our Prime Minister - not a far-right populist or provocative journalist, but our Prime Minister - is just beyond words. The fact that the head of our government is actually using language that helps incite violence toward MPs is so beyond dangerous I can\u2019t even comprehend it in a modern society. This isn\u2019t funny any more. Whatever egotistical game Boris Johnson has been playing since he was at Eton, this isn\u2019t entitled teenagers standing blindly by their positions in an attempt to one-up their friends anymore.\n\n\u201cThis of rising hatred is costing people their lives.\n\n\u201cI was 17 when Jo Cox was murdered. I just rang my mum, who is Yvette Cooper, on my way home from school to complain about the usual things and I distinctly remember her interrupting me to say \u2018An MP\u2019s been shot.\u2019\n\n\u201cI can honestly say my perspective of the world completely changed that day. Before then, my mum\u2019s job was something that kept her working later than bedtime when I was a kid, the source of embarrassing conversations at school, the reason we travelled to and fro between Yorkshire and London every week for the first two thirds of my life.\n\n\u201cIt was never something that could get her killed.\n\n\u201cI am scared.\n\n\u201cI am scared when I scroll through the replies to her tweets calling her a liar and a traitor.\n\n\u201cI am scared when our house gets fitted with panic buttons, industrial-locking doors and explosive bags to catch the mail.\n\n\u201cI am scared because on the 16th of June 2016, two children said goodbye to their mother before she left for her constituency to sit in surgeries and help people all day, and never saw her again. I am scared every single day that the same will happen to mine.\n\n\u201cBecause she is trying her best to help people. To make their lives better. Even if we disagree with our politicians, when was this something we actively wanted to hurt them for?\n\n\u201cOf course Brexit is contentious. Of course people have strong opinions, opinions that will inevitably come into conflict when trying to work out how best to deliver an outcome that split our country in two. But what we need now is a Prime Minister who can stand up and say \u2018Yes I want to deliver Brexit, but regardless of my position, this inflammatory and aggressive language needs to stop. We need to treat each other with humanity and respect.\u2019 Boris Johnson, take a stand. It\u2019s your job to unite the country.\n\n\u201cOr you will be responsible for putting other people\u2019s lives at risk.\n\n\u201cSurely you can raise your head out of the sand enough to see that much?\n\n\u201cThis whole thing has gone too far. When people start getting hurt is the moment that we should step back and ask if any of this is even worth it. All the anger and the screaming and the taking sides. The traitors and the liars and the surrendering.\n\n\u201cWhy has this become a matter of life and death? Does someone have to die for us all to realise that we have gotten in far too deep and far too aggressively?\n\n\u201cThe thing is, someone already has died. Do we not have the decency and compassion to see that? Can we not all just treat each other like people again?\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m terrified if we don\u2019t that something awful is going to happen again. At this rate, that seems like the only thing that could stop us in our tracks. We need to change the way we act towards our MPs before it goes too far because if not I have no doubt it will.\u201d", "description": "In wake of comments by Boris Johnson, Ellie Cooper tweets about real fear caused by inflammatory language in politics", "authors": ["John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac6c5c60fcd7fa5d9c1ec9a92fb24809fe5ba631/0_923_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8f3107472083e72a3c3ed09542107db", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
