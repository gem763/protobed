There is no other big question if the privacy issue is solved,\u201d he summarized.\n\nPan was commenting as cryptocurrency-related transaction privacy returns to the spotlight as international regulators dissect Facebook\u2019s Libra digital currency.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, concerns over user data have formed the basis for rejection of the project from multiple sources, including finance ministers and United States senators.\n\nIn the future, Pan continued, Bitcoin will need to provide users with a way to avoid governments targeting them and their wallets.\n\n\u201cWhat is more troublesome now is if government or law enforcement departments begin to create a blacklist of transaction addresses, it will make certain transactions unable to be packaged. In fact, these can be done,\u201d he explained.\n\nPan added:\n\n\u201cBut if there is privacy, you can't know who the address belongs to, and you can't determine how much the amount is, and there is no way to control the currency system.\u201d\n\nImproving transaction privacy is already a central occupation of developers, both for Bitcoin Core and off-chain solutions such as the Lightning Network.\n\nCertain user wallets claim to offer enhanced privacy for users already, but standards differ as developers attempt to seal technical loopholes.", "description": "Protecting users from government seizures and coercion of miners is paramount for Bitcoin, says Kevin Pan", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZjBmOTQ3ZTYwOTQ5ZTIzOWQ2ZGExNzczNjQwOWQ2ZDAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
