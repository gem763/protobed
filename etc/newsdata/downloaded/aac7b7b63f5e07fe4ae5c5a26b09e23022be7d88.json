Enough evasion, it's past time for answers.", "language": "en", "text": "Medicare for All will create winners and losers. It\u2019s all very well to say you can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking some eggs, unless you\u2019re the egg.\n\nWhen it comes to doing things, Elizabeth Warren has a plan for everything \u2014 and she\u2019s happy to tell you all about it. But when it comes to paying for things, I'm sorry to say, the Massachusetts senator dodges and deflects like a Donald Trump defender.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that \"Medicare for All\" will cost the federal government an extra $3 trillion a year. That\u2019s more than $9,000 annually from every man, woman and child in America. Despite being asked, again and again, Warren refuses to acknowledge that paying for this is going to require an across-the-board tax increase \u2014 and a pretty massive one, at that. Instead, she keep talking about how \u201ccosts\u201d will go down before she changes the subject to how stressful it is to have your insurance canceled when you get sick or when you have to cope with your mom having diabetes. That\u2019s very true, I\u2019m sure. But we\u2019re talking fiscal policy here.\n\nWinners and losers in Medicare for All\n\nThere\u2019s a very unpleasant collectivist feel to this. It\u2019s all very well to say you can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking some eggs \u2026 unless you\u2019re the egg. About 56% of Americans \u2014 more than 180 million \u2014 have private health insurance through an employer. Medicare for All would sweep that all away, whether the people who have that insurance like it or not, in the name of the common good. Perhaps worse, as Warren knows perfectly well but steadfastly refuses to admit, there are going to be winners and losers. Costs might go down in the aggregate, but individuals and families aren\u2019t aggregates.\n\nElizabeth Warren's choice: 'Medicare for All' purity or a path to beating Trump?\n\nFor example, Warren keeps saying that the total you pay for health care would end up being less under Medicare for All because it will eliminate out-of-pocket costs like premiums and copays. That\u2019s an oversimplification at best, especially since she hasn\u2019t said how she would finance this enormously expensive project.\n\nBut it is a given that everyone will pay higher taxes, and it\u2019s older people who spend more in premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs \u2014 a lot more. Consequently, older people will be far more likely to see these higher taxes offset by a decrease in the cost of their health care. By contrast, younger people and families at healthier stages of their lives would still be paying new taxes but will see fewer benefits.\n\nElizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg at the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15, 2019.

Or would they be better off forgoing that income and avoiding those health care costs later? I don\u2019t know, and neither does Sen. Warren. But this is exactly the kind of thing we need to have an open and honest debate about.\n\nGive voters facts, or GOP will do it\n\nWarren is treating the American public like children and insisting that she knows best. This is foolish in the extreme. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to discuss the costs and trade-offs of Medicare for All, she can be sure that, should she become the Democratic nominee, the Republicans will do it for her. Her refusal to admit the obvious makes her look dishonest.\n\nDoing it wrong: 2020 Democrats, stop arguing about health care and show leadership.\n\nMedicare for All is not a good idea. It\u2019s just an idea. It\u2019s up to the American people, after considering the pros and cons \u2014 which, yes, do include much higher taxes for everyone \u2014 to decide whether, on balance, the trade-offs make it worthwhile or whether something else, like an expanded and fortified Obamacare or a public insurance option, would be better.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is exactly correct when he says that Americans want choices, and that we should trust them to make the right decisions for themselves, for their families \u2014 and for the country. You do that by being straight with them. There are many possible paths to beating Donald Trump in 2020, but I can guarantee you that trying to out-spin and out-dodge him is not one of them.\n\nChris Truax is an appellate lawyer in San Diego and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
