But I was also worried about the survival of these incredibly cute chicks I got to know in the following weeks of filming.\n\nWithin a month, the first arrivals had doubled in weight and were too big for the brood pouches. Forced on to the ice by their parents, they were strong enough that this was not immediately life-threatening, but we were about to be hit by the worst weather of the year.\n\nIt would be a challenge even for the adult penguins, whose coats have evolved to withstand freezing conditions. But many of the chicks were still covered only in fluffy down. With wind speeds expected to exceed 100 mph, those already evicted from the brood pouches wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. All I could do as we finished filming before the bad conditions set in was wish the colony well.\n\nThe Great Escape: One by one, each penguin became aware of the possibilities the ramp offered and, by following the birds in front, they began to edge themselves to freedom\n\nThat night, the wind picked up as forecast and, from then on, it didn\u2019t cease. The station vibrated, our skidoos outside the front door became buried and our parked sledges blew across the ice.\n\nEvery weather we had experienced in previous months came back in a more brutal way than I\u2019d ever seen before.\n\nDay after day, I longed for it to give in, picturing the danger it would present to the colony. In the zero visibility created by the unrelenting blizzards, the penguins wouldn\u2019t be able to see the enormous gullies that had opened up in the ice. These deathtraps had walls up to 60 ft high and, the more that I thought about the birds tumbling into them, the worse the images in my head became. I dreaded returning.\n\nUnable to climb out of this icy prison with their chicks on their feet, those adults faced a harrowing predicament: dying a long, painful death with their young, or leaving them to their inevitable fate. Pictured, an adult penguin climbs out of ravine after abandoning its chick\n\nDuring that time, I kept myself as occupied as possible in the research station that had been our home for the past nine months.\n\nArriving there in December 2016 had been the fulfilment of a dream that had become fixed in my mind ten years earlier. It was November 5, 2006, and I, along with millions of others, became glued to the television watching David Attenborough\u2019s ground-breaking wildlife series Planet Earth.\n\nGrowing up in the countryside around the Lake District, I had long thought about becoming a wildlife photographer.\n\nLindsay McCrae: 'It was an incredible feeling of joy and relief watching them line up along the ramp and return to the colony'\n\nThat evening, sitting on the sofa with a hot cup of tea, I felt an urge to be with the Emperor penguins who were filling my screen, battling the atrocious conditions that a winter at the bottom of our planet threw at them.\n\nAlthough penguins had always fascinated me, I\u2019d never seen one, not even in a zoo, but they held a special place in my heart.\n\nIn nature, nothing quite defines perfection like an Emperor penguin. Out of the world\u2019s 17 species of penguin, they\u2019re both the largest, at nearly 4ft tall, and the heaviest, at 55lb. With their golden cravats, dazzlingly white diamond bellies and long, pink-and-blue, curved bills, they are also one of the most beautiful creatures on Earth.\n\nI longed to see them in their natural habitat, and my dream came a step closer when, at 18, I got a job as a runner on the BBC\u2019s Springwatch programme.\n\nLindsay got to know the incredibly cute chicks over the following weeks of filming in Antarctica\u2019s Atka Bay\n\nI was basically a dogsbody, there to do anything asked of me, but eventually, I worked my way up to become a cameraman and within a few years came the offer to film penguins in Antarctica for David Attenborough\u2019s Dynasties series.\n\nI knew immediately that I wanted to go, but there was a catch. I would have to be away for 11 months. For eight of those, the weather would be so unpredictable and extreme that both air and boat transport would be unable to reach us. No way in; no way out.\n\nUntil recently, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for people travelling to Antarctica to have their appendix removed beforehand, to avoid any possibility of needing an appendectomy while away from medical help.\n\nFor nine weeks, each egg had rested on its father\u2019s feet, protected by the \u2018brood pouch\u2019, a warm layer of feathered skin. Pictured, Emperor penguins with their chicks\n\nNowadays, the facilities are so advanced that such operations can be performed at certain stations.\n\nRegardless, I was examined from top to bottom \u2014 literally. I had a thorough dental check, resulting in a filling being replaced in case it came loose.\n\nTo my horror, an X-ray almost resulted in having my wisdom teeth removed, just in case they became impacted while I was there. Luckily, I got away with that one.\n\nIt would also be the longest I\u2019d ever been away from home, and I\u2019d only recently bought a house with Becky, my girlfriend of six years.\n\nBecky had uprooted her whole life to move up to the Lake District to be with me, and we were living very happily together with our two dogs, Willow and Ivy.\n\nThat she agreed to me going says a lot about the person she is. Especially since, in the late summer of 2016, with only a few months to go before my scheduled departure, Becky discovered she was pregnant.\n\nBy then, I had already committed to the penguin project. There was no option other than to be away for the birth. When our son, Walter, arrived in the world four months after I\u2019d arrived in Antarctica, my first sight of him was via a videocall on my computer.\n\nThe image was blurry, but the audio was as clear as day, the sound of a screaming little baby dominating before Becky\u2019s face filled the screen. \u2018I wish you were here,\u2019 she said, shedding tears of joy at the birth of our new baby boy, but also of sadness that we weren\u2019t together. My own tears began to trickle down my cheeks, and not for the last time.\n\nA month or so later, the female penguins began laying their precious eggs, then disappeared north for the next two months to find open water in which they could feed.\n\nThe unhatched offspring were left in the care of the males, who would incubate them for around 64 days, the longest continuous duration in the bird world.\n\nI had filmed one pair as, the transfer to the male\u2019s feet complete, he blanketed the egg with his feathers, dropped his shoulders and closed his eyes \u2014 signalling to the female that their unborn offspring was safely in his care.\n\nWalking away, she hesitated and glanced back. I couldn\u2019t help but translate it as: \u2018Stay safe, I won\u2019t be long.\u2019 Her head dropped, she fell on to her belly and started to toboggan away into the distance.\n\nThe strength of the bond between the two birds was overwhelming and, all of a sudden, I was struck by the parallels between a pair of Emperor penguins and my own relationship with Becky.\n\nThis pair had just separated, not knowing if they\u2019d ever see each other again, and, as I thought of the moment I\u2019d left Becky and our unborn baby at the front door of the house, it hit me. Tears filled my eyes and froze immediately to the tops of my cheeks and balaclava.\n\nClearly, my emotions were very close to the surface, and they weighed on me during the long days and nights when September came and we found ourselves confined to the research station by that severe weather which posed such a threat to the colony.\n\nDesperate to get out into the painful outdoors to do more filming, I knew that what we were going to find might be ugly, but the question was: just how ugly?\n\nFinally, after just under two weeks, which felt like a lifetime, a break in the storm opened up, giving me the chance to get back down to the birds and survey the carnage with the director, Will, and assistant cameraman, Stefan.\n\nLike molehills in a field, hundreds of downy bodies lay strewn across the ice sheet. Blown huge distances away from the colony, those helpless penguin chicks \u2014 who had so recently lost the protection of their parents\u2019 brood pouches \u2014 had simply frozen to death.\n\nOthers lay on their backs, still alive, but stuck to the ice. Waving their feet in the air, they were attempting the impossible task of righting themselves.\n\nLooking down into the depths of one huge gully, I could see chicks desperately trying to scramble out, attempting to grip on to the near-vertical walls of ice. I couldn\u2019t bear it.\n\nI had spent so long with the Emperor penguins \u2014 and gone through almost every moment of their breeding season with them \u2014 that they felt like family. Seeing them in this state and not being able to help was heartbreaking.\n\nSome of the adults in the gully had chicks still too young to leave their brood pouches.\n\nUnable to climb out of this icy prison with their chicks on their feet, those adults faced a harrowing predicament: dying a long, painful death with their young, or leaving them to their inevitable fate.\n\nHalf way through the day, a couple of the penguins suddenly looked as if they\u2019d had enough. Stepping away from their chicks without looking back, they did not appear to have any second thoughts. They knew what they were doing.\n\nFor the helpless chicks, their first few premature steps on to the ice would be their last.\n\nThat evening and the following day, we were unable to get back to the colony, but, as a team, we spoke in depth about what we\u2019d seen and decided that, depending on the situation when we managed to return, we had to intervene in some way to try to help.\n\nStuck in the station, all I could think about were the trapped birds and what they were going through.\n\nI constantly checked the weather and wind speed outside and I knew that they would be struggling.\n\nAfter 48 hours, thankfully the weather broke and we could get back down there. Peering into the gully at the group of adults stranded there, it was clear that, since we\u2019d left them, more had decided to abandon their young to save themselves. We couldn\u2019t let that continue to happen, so, after lowering ourselves into the bottom of the gully with ropes and harnesses, we set to work with big red shovels, digging into the slope and forming a ramp that they could potentially shuffle up with their chicks.\n\nClimbing out of the gully, I wondered what the penguins were thinking. We\u2019d done our bit \u2014 now it was up to them. But were they clever enough to figure it out?\n\nThe answer came as two individuals headed to the end of the gully we\u2019d been working in. Naturally nosy creatures, they just couldn\u2019t hold themselves back from investigating what we\u2019d been up to.\n\nOnce at the base of the ramp, the first bird simply didn\u2019t stop. Slowly shuffling one foot after the other, he carefully scaled the incline all the way to the top.\n\nOne by one, each penguin became aware of the possibilities the ramp offered and, by following the birds in front, they began to edge themselves to freedom.\n\nIt was an incredible feeling of joy and relief watching them line up along the ramp and return to the colony. I understood that our actions would be seen as controversial, that some people would claim we should have let nature take its course, but being there I also saw the other side of it.\n\nThe Emperors and their chicks hadn\u2019t been pushed or chased into the gully by a predator, and their slow, lengthy deaths wouldn\u2019t have immediately benefitted any other life form.\n\nAlso, the help we had given them was indirect. By digging a shallow ramp, we\u2019d given the penguins an option, a way out, but we had left the decision to them.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have to use it, but they did: they saved themselves.\n\nThat certainly seemed to be the consensus when the film was eventually broadcast back in the UK, with many viewers expressing their support for the rescue, and praise for the film generally, all of which was a massive relief\n\nWhen I was out there shooting for all those months, I never really knew what the finished documentary would look like, but the team did an incredible job with what we\u2019d managed to capture and the film was stunning.\n\nEight million people tuned in to watch when it was first shown and, since then, it has been seen across the world. I still find those numbers difficult to comprehend. Very, very few get the chance to visit Antarctica, let alone see an Emperor penguin in the wild.\n\nI hope we demonstrated to all those viewers just how incredible the creature is.\n\nA quote I read before I ever thought I would make it to Antarctica had always struck a chord with me. It came from Apsley Cherry-Garrard, an English explorer and author who joined Captain Scott\u2019s ill-fated attempt to reach the South Pole in the early 20th century.\n\n\u2018Take it all in all, I do not believe anybody on Earth has a worse time than an Emperor penguin.\u2019\n\nI can now say I have witnessed first-hand the brutal truth behind that statement.", "description": "LINDSAY MCCRAE: Watching tiny Emperor penguin chicks breaking out of their eggs, guarded  by their fathers, was among the most magical moments I had in filmed in Antarctica's Atka Bay.", "authors": ["Lindsay Mcrae For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/22/20198544-0-image-a-19_1572037729240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
