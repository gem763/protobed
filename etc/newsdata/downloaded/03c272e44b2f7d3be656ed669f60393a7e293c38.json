This is just a broad agreement,\u201d Hill told Reuters upon leaving the signing ceremony.\n\nThis was the latest effort by McAleenan to seal immigration deals with the Northern Triangle countries of Central America - Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - where most immigrants arriving at the U.S. southern border hail from.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his administration and is pushing to staunch the flow of migrants - many of them families - crossing into the United States. Border crossings reached record highs earlier this year, frustrating Trump, whose central presidential campaign promise was to cut down on illegal immigration.\n\nGuatemala signed a deal that requires asylum seekers to ask for refuge in Guatemala instead of in the United States if they traveled through the former country on the way to the U.S.-Mexico border. The Guatemalan Congress, however has not ratified the deal.\n\nThe United States has a similar \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement with Canada.\n\nImmigration advocates contend Central American countries, where many people are fleeing from violence, poverty and endemic corruption, do not have the capacity to process more asylum claims and cannot assure safety for vulnerable migrants.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan attends a news conference in San Salvador, El Salvador August 28, 2019. REUTERS/Jose Cabezas/File Photo\n\nEl Salvador, which has 6.6 million people, is one of the world\u2019s most violent nations, largely due to criminal gangs involved in drug trafficking and extortion.\n\nEven as the U.S. government has pursued these deals, the Department of Homeland Security issued a rule on July 16 that would bar most migrants from gaining U.S. asylum if they had not sought safe haven in a country they transited through first.\n\nThe rule accomplishes virtually the same thing as the agreements, but it has faced legal challenges. A federal court initially blocked the rule from taking effect, but the Supreme Court on Sept. 11 allowed it to be implemented while the court challenges are ongoing.
