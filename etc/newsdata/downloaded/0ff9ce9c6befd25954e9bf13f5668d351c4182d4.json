Breeding pigs, known as sows, must have at least 24 square feet, and egg-laying hens must have 1 square foot.\n\n\u201cThose numbers are unrealistic,\u201d said Mark Dopp, the senior vice president and general counsel for the North American Meat Institute. \u201cForty-three square feet is an enormous amount of space, and 24 square feet is also a lot. Both numbers greatly exceed the industry standard.\u201d\n\nThe mandate comes from a new law California voters passed in November called Proposition 12, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. The North American Meat Institute filed a lawsuit against the state Friday on the grounds that it is unconstitutional \u2014 specifically that it violates the commerce clause.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has no authority to regulate the conditions under which farm animals are housed outside its borders,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nThe suit also claims that the law discriminates against out-of-state farmers, as in-state producers already adhere to stricter space requirements thanks to laws passed in 2008.\n\nWhen filing the lawsuit, the institute asked the court for an immediate injunction, Dopp said. The group hopes to have a hearing on that request within a few weeks.\n\nCalifornia voters passed Proposition 12 with 63 percent in favor. Its supporters hailed it a victory for animal welfare and rights.\n\n\u201cMillions of veal calves, mother pigs and egg-laying hens will never know the misery of being locked in a tiny cage for the duration of their lives,\u201d said Kitty Block, the acting president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, one of the proposition\u2019s key supporters.\n\nBut the meat industry warned that the regulations would create havoc in the market.\n\nVeal and pork producers must now decide between making costly renovations to their animal housing or missing out on the lucrative California market, Dopp said. And that is no small omission.\n\nCalifornia has the largest gross domestic product of any state, and its economy is a powerhouse even when compared to various nations. It\u2019s the fifth-largest in the world, behind only the combined United States, China, Japan and Germany.\n\nAs more farmers move to comply with the space regulations, pork and veal production will likely decrease and become more costly to consumers, economists say. This will be especially true in California, according to the state\u2019s Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cThis measure would result in many farmers having to remodel or build new housing for animals,\u201d the agency\u2019s report said. \u201cThis housing also could be more expensive to run on an ongoing basis. Much of these increased costs are likely to be passed through to consumers.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it may take several years for enough farms to make the switch to more spacious cages, which would lead to a significant short term shortage of those items, the agency said.\n\n\u201cThese shortfalls would lead to an increase in prices until farmers can meet demand,\u201d it said.\n\nMeat industry groups say this price increase could hit consumers outside California as well, as most of the nation\u2019s pork, veal and egg production occurs outside the state.\n\n\u201cSome hog farmers likely would go out of business,\u201d the National Pork Producers Council said in a statement. \u201cOf course, animal rights groups not only know this, they count on it to achieve their goal of significantly reducing meat consumption in America.\u201d\n\nThe egg industry, which is not represented in the Meat Institute\u2019s lawsuit, faces similar dilemmas.\n\n\u201cSome producers who supply California might decide to stop supplying California and try to supply the rest of the country, instead,\u201d said Maro Ibarburu, an associate scientist-business analyst at the Egg Industry Center located at Iowa State University.\n\nThe North American Meat Institute\u2019s key concern is the precedent this law could set.\n\n\u201cIt sets a precedent for other states to impose other requirements,\u201d Dopp said. \u201cBut, what if those states decide 24 feet isn\u2019t enough \u2014 that it should be 26? And then another state says 30. And you end up with a patchwork of different requirements that inhibit the flow of commerce.\u201d", "description": "EVANSVILLE, Ind., Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 An industry group is trying to stop California from requiring that out-of-state farmers raise their animals in more", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
