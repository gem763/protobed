The first known framework of the rules of Kabaddi as an indigenous sport of India was prepared in Maharashtra in the year 1921 for Kabaddi competitions on the pattern of Sanjeevani and Gemini in a combined form.\n\nDon't Miss 1.5 K SHARES 474 SHARES 235 SHARES 425 SHARES 332 SHARES\n\nThereafter a committee was constituted in the year 1923, which amended the rules framed in 1921. The amended rules were applied during the All India Kabaddi Tournament organized in 1923.\n\nThe sport slowly started to make strides and gain a foothold across the length and breadth of the country. It was fast becoming very popular among people, more so because one didn't need equipment to play the sport.\n\nBCCL\n\nThe massive changes to overhaul the foundation and structure of the sport began in 1950 when All India Kabaddi Federation (AIKF) was formed. It was done with the intention to promote the game. In 1952, the Senior National championship were started as a part of massive developments to come to kabaddi in India.\n\nThe current body governing the sport in the country, Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI) came in to existence from the year 1972, which is affiliated to Indian Olympic Association (IOA), with a view to popularize the game in India & neighboring countries of Asia.\n\nAfter formation of this body, Kabaddi took a new shape and National level competitions started for Junior and Sub-junior boys & girls. These competitions have had a massive impact on grooming and bringing in new talent.\n\nFacebook\n\nIn many ways, kabaddi is simply the story of our life - the moment you 'touch' your 'success' line, 'people' will start pulling your 'leg'! But the game can't be as simple as that.\n\nIndia has been a dominant force in the game - winning the lone Gold Medal of Kabaddi in the 11th Asian Games in Beijing in 1990. India is the reigning champion in the succeeding Asian Games held in Hiroshima 1994, Bangkok 1998, and Busan 2002, Doha 2006, Guangzhou 2010 and recently in 2014.\n\nIndian team has dominated the World Cup too, the three editions of the tournament that have been held since 2014, India has come out triumphs on all three occasions. Indomitable and relentless - team India has been winning everything there is for the taking.\n\nESPN\n\nNow that is how the game came to being and evolved over the years. But do you know how the game is played and what rules are followed? If you don't, let us tell you then.\n\nA combative sport, kabaddi involves seven players on each side, who take each other out over two halves. The game is played for a period of 40 minutes with a 5 minutes break (20-5-20).\n\nThe core idea of the game is to score points by raiding into the opponent\u2019s court and touching as many defense players as possible without getting caught on a single breath.\n\nOne player, chanting Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi! charges into the opponent court and try to touch the opponent closest to him, while the seven opponents make maneuvers to catch the attacker. This is kabaddi, the match of one against seven, known as the game of struggle.\n\nFacebook\n\nThe players on the defensive side are called \u201cAntis\u201d while the player of the offence is called the \u201cRaider\u201d. The attack in Kabaddi is known as a \u2018Raid\u2019.\n\nThe antis touched by the raider during the attack are declared \u2018out\u2019 if they do not succeed in catching the raider before he returns to home court. These players can resume play only when their side scores points against the opposite side during their raiding turn or if the remaining players succeed in catching the opponent\u2019s raider.\n\nPKL\n\nThere has been a gradual but significant change in the trends of the game since the past 50 years. What was once considered a game of brawn is not so now.\n\nThe introduction of mats, shoes, new techniques & changes in rules has made the sport more interesting and advantageous to skilled players who are now able to defeat heavier players with better skills & techniques.", "description": "If you are from the sub-continent, you might be synonymous with the sport of kabaddi, and chances are you might even have tried your luck with a few raids of your own.
