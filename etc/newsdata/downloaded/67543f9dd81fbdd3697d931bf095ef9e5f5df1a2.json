SoftBank's Vision Fund has transformed the market for venture capital in recent years with its $100 billion size dwarfing its competitors.\n\nDespite mixed results in terms of success, given the failed IPO of WeWork earlier this week, SoftBank has positioned itself as one of the key players in the world of tech, with the Vision Fund itself accounting for 8% of the cash provided by venture capitalists.\n\nCrunchbase News noted that SoftBank alone was not responsible for all of the investment, rather it looked all the rounds of investing where SoftBank was a sole investor and also listed as just a participant.\n\nSoftBank's hold has only grown\n\nNevertheless, the data from Crunchbase News shows that SoftBank's hold within tech has only grown in the last year and that the company has pushed into late-stage investing more often \u2014 just take the investments into Uber, Slack, and WeWork ahead of their IPOs as examples.\n\nHave a look at this list. It includes the $5 billion that SoftBank put into WeWork this year as well as billions on other tech companies from Asian taxi-hailing firms to Colombian food-delivery startups.\n\nSoftbank has come under fire though for its investment strategy after the botched IPO of WeWork. The Japanese firm allows tech companies to stay liquid while being held privately, eventually being able to go public.\n\nHowever, WeWork exposed the issues of this plan as the original valuation of $47 billion was cut to just $10 billion before the IPO was pulled, as SoftBank's execs decided it was not worth it. SoftBank had plowed more than $10 billion into WeWork prior to this, and had a 29% stake in the firm, only for the grand IPO plans to fall through.", "description": "SoftBank has been one of the biggest players in tech startups in 2019 and has a major hand in Uber, WeWork, and Slack, but its role could be even larger t...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d9470ca8bd8ec01fd7dd5d7-2400/masayoshi-son.jpg"}
