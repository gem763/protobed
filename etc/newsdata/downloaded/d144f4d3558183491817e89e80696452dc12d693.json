The Delaware Chancery Court ruled in Saba\u2019s favor in June on two of the funds. A Maryland court ruled in favor of BlackRock on a third fund, a BlackRock spokesman said. The two firms have ongoing litigation.\n\nIn another dispute, Saba recently proposed changes at a Neuberger Berman Group LLC closed-end fund in which it owns shares. In response, Neuberger Berman fought the propositions and alleged a fund run by Saba is violating securities laws.\n\nSaba, a $1.7 billion hedge fund, is an investor in many closed-end funds.\n\nSuch funds hold securities and, like exchange-traded funds, are listed on exchanges. But while ETF share prices typically track the price of the underlying securities, closed-end funds often don\u2019t. Saba is an activist investor, buying up large positions in funds with low prices and trying to force changes, such as overhauling the board. The fund operators often resist.\n\nFrank J. Abella Jr., a decadeslong investor in closed-end funds and the chief executive of Investment Partners Group, said the dispute has potentially high stakes.\n\nIf Saba prevails, \u201cthis industry is going to be shaken to its core,\u201d he said. \u201cThe line is drawn in the sand.\u201d\n\n...", "description": "Boaz Weinstein Hedge Fund Spars With BlackRock and Neuberger Saba is embroiled in fights over closed-end fund boards with asset managers and law firm - 20088", "authors": ["Participant", "Follower"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
