REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s monthly fund manager survey revealed some shocking insights about how the investor community views President Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nSome 43% of respondents don\u2019t think the trade war will be resolved and view the situation as the \u201cnew normal.\u201d Only 36% of respondents expect a solution prior to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMore broadly, some 40% of respondents view trade as the biggest \u201ctail risk\u201d for the markets.\n\nAn \u2018end\u2019 to the trade war?\n\nTrade tensions, which have persisted for roughly 18 months, have finally started to show signs of easing, with the U.S. and China agreeing to a phase 1 trade deal last Friday, which sent the broader stock market back within a stone\u2019s throw away from record highs. Though the deal isn\u2019t yet signed in writing.\n\nThe aforementioned fund manager survey was conducted on Oct. 4-10, prior to the phase 1 trade deal reached on Oct. 11. Still, 75% of respondents say \u201can end to the trade war would be the most bullish catalyst for stocks in the next six months.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestors remain bearish but we are seeing signs of green shoots,\u201d said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cIf concerns about the trade war and Brexit are unrealized, sentiment is likely to improve, validating our bullish tactical views.\u201d\n\nThe bearish sentiment Hartnett references is seen in the increased cash levels that fund managers maintained, rising to 5%, compared to 4.7% in September. That\u2019s still below June\u2019s record high of 5.7%.\n\nThe survey included 230 respondents with a total $620 billion in assets under management.\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
