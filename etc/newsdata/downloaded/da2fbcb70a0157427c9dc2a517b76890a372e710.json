That runs close to zero in healthcare,\" Mr Mitchell said.\n\n\"So a 5 per cent cap rate in healthcare is a 4 per cent equivalent cap rate in offices.\"\n\nInstitutional investors such as superannuation funds would find that particularly irresistible as they looked to secure the income certainty, Mr Morrison said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsurance companies also provide an impetus for the growth of the non-hospital medical and aged-care facilities, as do the governments that are trying to preserve hospitals for those with acute needs.\n\n\"Day surgeries \u2013 we don't have a lot of those \u2013 but health insurers in Australia will say it is 23 per cent cheaper to a procedure in a day surgery versus a private hospital,\" Mr Mitchell said.\n\n\"That's $250 million a year in savings on health insurance. That is an example of how mixing and matching works for us.\"\n\nThe building of medical precincts around a public hospital also offered further investment opportunities, panellists said.", "description": "\"A 5 per cent cap rate in healthcare is a 4 per cent equivalent cap rate in offices\": NorthWest Healthcare Properties Australia and NZ's Craig Mitchell", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2327%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_46%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d3232bac14e56eb59b5507e813383881c1f9fc21", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
