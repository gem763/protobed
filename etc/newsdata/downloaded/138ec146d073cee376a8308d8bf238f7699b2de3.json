Amazon has a very good value proposition for customers inside their houses: Echo speakers are great for music, timers and such in the kitchen, and smarthome controls.\n\nAmazon clearly has ambitions to make Alexa the leading platform for ambient computing. But to do that, it needs more ubiquity than it can achieve right now. That\u2019s one reason that Amazon was so excited to announce a partnership with GM to make Alexa available on those cars. It\u2019s also one reason I was surprised to see the company didn\u2019t announce any updates to the Echo Auto.\n\nBut the most obvious way to do that is to be the default assistant on phones. Amazon is probably never going to get there, because Apple won\u2019t allow it, for one thing. On Android you can switch our your default assistant from Google to Alexa, but the number of customers who realize that\u2019s possible is small and the number who are likely to do it is even smaller.\n\nCommand Line is The Verge\u2019s daily newsletter about personal tech.

It\u2019s simply the easiest explanation for why any third-party technology is bad: without deep system-level access, third-party accessories and ecosystems end up failing on phones all the time. Alexa on phones is often more capable than it gets credit for \u2014 but it\u2019s still nowhere near as good nor as integrated as the Google Assistant or even Siri.\n\nTo just blame closed ecosystems is too simplistic. There\u2019s actually a chicken and egg problem here. Let\u2019s call the chicken the lack of platform-level access on phones. The egg is that Alexa is often comically bad outside the home. Our Echo Auto review lays it out: Alexa regularly sends you down infuriating and circular discussion paths when you\u2019re just trying to get something done.\n\nIt actually is possible to make Alexa somewhat useful in the car or even when you\u2019re walking down the street, but you have to work at it a bit. You have to put more of your online life into Alexa\u2019s hands, and right now the Alexa ecosystem can\u2019t handle as much as Apple or Google can. Alexa is very good at smart home gadgets, lists, and a few other domains, but it feels very disconnected from the rest of the things in your digital life: your email, calendar, messages, and all the rest.\n\nSo while you can connect a lot of that up, how many people are really, fully living that \u201cAlexa Life?\u201d Whatever the number is, it\u2019s probably not enough to start a virtuous cycle of Alexa use outside the home.\n\nYou might be familiar with the original \u201cSiri Problem,\u201d where you\u2019d try it a few times and Siri would fail completely, so you\u2019d give up on it. It took Siri years to get over that problem \u2014 and in some ways it still suffers from it. Siri isn\u2019t great, but I think it\u2019s better than its reputation for a lot of the simple things people ask of it.\n\nI think the same sort of problem applies to Alexa outside the home, only solving it will be doubly hard because of the platform access problem.\n\nAll of which is a very long preamble to talking about the hardware products that I personally found the most intriguing at Amazon\u2019s event. While the Echo speakers \u2014 especially the Echo Studio \u2014 are likely to be the things that are most popular in the next year, I think the Echo Buds, the Echo Frames, and the Echo Loop ring may be more important to Amazon\u2019s future.\n\nDon\u2019t misread me: the \u201cDay1\u201d label put on the Frames and the Loop are a sign that these are very much beta products. They\u2019re invite-only and they\u2019re probably not going to be all that great to use. I tried the Loop out a few times and was not very impressed.\n\nPlus, you have to be a particular kind of person to want to wear slightly-dorky looking accessories like the Frame or the Loop. If you are, you\u2019re probably the kind of person who\u2019s also more likely to go through the effort it takes to live that Alexa Life. If so, you\u2019re the ideal person for Amazon to learn from. The Frames and the Loop are market research masquerading as consumer products.\n\nBut the Echo Buds are something different: they are genuinely mass-market and genuinely competitive to other wireless earbuds. They are aggressively (some might say predatorily) priced, feature-rich, and higher-quality than many first-gen Amazon products. We\u2019ll need to do a full-review to really judge them, but it\u2019s hard not to see them as an effort to get you to use Alexa more.\n\nMaybe. There are plenty of other Bluetooth headphones out in the world that already support Alexa and they aren\u2019t exactly seen as a threat to Siri or Google. Even if the Echo Buds prove to be wildly popular, I suspect they\u2019ll only add a modest bump to Alexa\u2019s overall usage. Amazon will see what people are willing to ask Alexa while on the go, though, and use that to build more features going forward \u2014 just like it has with the Echo speakers in your house.\n\nAlexa\u2019s real competition outside the home isn\u2019t the Google Assistant or Siri. It\u2019s your thumbs and the screen you tap with them. If Amazon can get you to talk to your headphones and not pull your phone out of your pocket just once or twice a day, that\u2019s a marginal win for Alexa.\n\nThen again, if Amazon\u2019s hardware efforts has taught us anything over the years, it has been that the company knows how to build a business off slim margins.\n\nMore from The Verge\n\n+ Oculus is trying to make the Quest the only home headset that matters\n\nAmazon\u2019s big event wasn\u2019t the only big tech event this week \u2014 the other was Oculus\u2019 conference. As per usual, I need to disclose that my wife works for Oculus, so I\u2019ll let Adi Robertson and Nick Statt\u2019s coverage tell you what happened there:\n\nIf Oculus Link actually works, and you\u2019re a normal person who likes to play or watch VR experiences at home, there\u2019s basically no reason to buy anything but a Quest. It offers a huge jump in capabilities over the Oculus Go, which makes it easily worth the extra $200. (Almost nobody needs a VR headset right now. So if you\u2019re going to get one, it\u2019s worth spending more on something that expands your options so much.) Even if you primarily use VR with a gaming PC, the Quest adds a lot of functionality over a Rift S for the same $399 price. And it\u2019s clearly where Oculus is focusing its efforts right now, so it might be faster to get future updates as well.\n\n+ Oculus Link will let you plug your Quest headset into a gaming PC to play Rift games\n\n+ Oculus is launching hand tracking on Quest next year\n\n+ Facebook says it will build AR glasses and map the world\n\nPixel leaks: can\u2019t stop won\u2019t stop\n\nA new Pixel 4 XL leak shows off next-gen Google Assistant and face unlock\n\nAndroid 10 Go is a faster and more secure update to Google\u2019s lightweight OS\n\nOnePlus 7T review: the best of the 7 Pro, for less\n\nList of apps supporting Pixel 4 motion gestures leaks\n\nAmazon\u2019s 80 announcements\n\n+ Amazon event 2019: Echo Buds, Frames, Loop, Eero, Studio, Ring camera, and Alexa updates: This is a good roundup of everything that happened.\n\n+ Amazon says last years\u2019 microwave sold really well, so it now has made an Amazon Alexa Smart Oven.\n\n+ Amazon\u2019s new Echo Studio sounds like the future of smart speakers\n\nDan Seifert got an early exclusive look at this.
