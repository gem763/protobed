In the new second trailer above, Disney now highlights the upside of having a baby and not having time to shower your dog with attention: she\u2019ll finally be free to fall in love and see the world. Or, at least, the parts of the world accessible to dogs. Either way, looks like they\u2019re in for a very bella notte.\n\nTessa Thompson and Justin Theroux voice the pampered pet and ownerless scamp, respectively, who, unlike Disney\u2019s most recent remake, are actually played by live-action dogs, save for their CGI-manipulated mouths. Rounding out the cast are Ashley Benson, Sam Elliott, Benedict Wong, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, who is rerecording the original film\u2019s classic Peggy Lee song \u201cHe\u2019s a Tramp.\u201d\n\nYvette Nicole Brown, who plays Aunt Sarah in the film and was also the moderator at the Lady and the Tramp panel at Disney\u2019s D23, pointed out, \u201cMost of our canine stars were rescues.\u201d As if two dogs falling in love wasn\u2019t sweet enough, Brown also revealed that she adopted one of the pups from the film: one of Lady\u2019s on-screen doubles.\n\nWhile you unfortunately don\u2019t see Lady and the Tramp accidentally spaghetti-kiss in either trailer, it would be inconceivable for Disney not to re-create the most iconic moment from the 1955 animated original for its new film. We have the technology! We have the romantic ambiance! We clearly have the spaghetti! Lady and the Tramp bursts through the doggy dog onto Disney\u2019s new streaming platform Disney+ on November 12.", "description": "Friday at C23, Disney reveals the first trailer for their live-action Lady And The Tramp movie, scheduled to hit Disney+ on November 12.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer", "Chris Lee"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/14-Lady-And-the-Tramp-Trailer-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
