These organisations include subsidiaries of the big four banks, AMP and IOOF.\n\n\"The government thanks the professional associations and acknowledges the considerable amount of time and resources that have been undertaken towards implementing code monitoring by the end of this year,\" Mr Frydenberg and Ms Hume said in a joint statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Inherent conflict'\n\nThe two largest financial adviser associations, the AFA and FPA \u2013 which were the driving forces behind the CMA application \u2013 both came under fire during the public hearings of the banking royal commission.\n\nDuring intense cross-examination by counsel assisting Rowena Orr, QC, during the second round of hearings on April 26, Mr Kewin and FPA chief executive Dante De Gori were both asked to defend their organisational structures.\n\nMs Orr asked how an organisation seeking to make itself attractive to potential members could at the same time seek to make itself attractive to regulate the conduct of those members.\n\n\u201cIsn't there an inherent conflict in those two propositions?\u201d\n\nThe inquiry also heard evidence of the inability of the associations to penalise members for unethical conduct.\n\nNational Australia Bank's former general manager of wealth, Andrew Hagger, told the royal commission that advisers who got into trouble could simply \"go down the road to another association\".\n\nThe commission heard that a complaint to the FPA about financial adviser Sam Henderson, a prominent member of the association, went unresolved for more than a year after being lodged.\n\nRecommendation 2.10 of the royal commission's final report stated the law should be amended to establish a new disciplinary system for financial advisers, including the establishment of a new disciplinary body and fresh reporting requirements for licensees.", "description": "The move is in line with a recommendation by the Hayne royal commission and has prompted six peak groups to withdraw their bid to create a new ethics monitor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/66c9fccdb4002e96fa88629bd0f02dbc31091226", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
