All told, revenue from businesses Sewing has earmarked for growth fell 4%, with the corporate bank being the only core unit to post growth.\n\nSewing, 49, is trying to reverse years of revenue contraction, low profitability and a share slump that\u2019s raised concern about the lender\u2019s future. He\u2019s exiting unprofitable businesses and focusing on traditional strengths, such as the corporate bank. But that unit and the retail business face headwinds from competition and negative interest rates in Europe, while the investment bank is struggling to regain market share in debt trading after years of piecemeal cutbacks.\n\nThe new strategy announced by the CEO in early July marked the biggest cutback to the investment bank since Deutsche Bank built up the business in the 1990s. While top shareholders and regulators have signaled support, the shares have barely budged as many analysts warn of high execution risks. The bank already had to walk back a revenue target after a slowing economy made it unlikely that interest rates would start to rise.\n\nDeutsche Bank fell as much as 5.2% in early Frankfurt trading, the most in more than two months, and was down about 4% at 9:20 a.m.\n\nAmong the bright spots in the report is the corporate bank, which sells risk management and trade finance products to large companies. The unit, a key focus of Sewing\u2019s, saw revenue increase 6% in the quarter. The business of advising companies on deals and raising capital reported a 20% jump. The DWS asset management unit attracted 6.2 billion euros ($6.9 billion) in new money, the third straight quarter of net inflows.\n\nThe bank managed to keep stable a crucial metric of capital strength known as common equity tier 1 ratio. Sewing has promised to fund the restructuring without tapping investors for fresh money, instead relying on drawing down the bank\u2019s capital reserves. Deutsche Bank continued to make progress on costs, cutting its own metric of expenses excluding restructuring charges for a seventh consecutive quarter.\n\nBut the lender lowered the outlook for its largest unit, saying the private bank will see slightly lower revenue for the full year, after previously guiding that it would be unchanged. The bank said the drop in overall core revenue reflected headwinds from the restructuring, the global economy and lower interest rates during the quarter.\n\nIn rates trading, which is a unit of the investment bank, the decline would have been 10% when adjusted for one-time factors, finance chief James von Moltke said on a call. CEO Sewing told employees in a memo that he expects that business as well as emerging market debt to stabilize soon.\n\n\u201cWe are investing in these businesses, for example in electronic trading, and our momentum has been very encouraging recently,\u201d the CEO said in a message to employees.\n\nThe performance in fixed-income trading compares with a gain of about 10% reported by the large Wall Street peers. Among European investment banks, the results were uneven, with Barclays Plc posting a 19% gain while HSBC Holdings Plc saw a 21% slump in revenue from that business.\n\nThe division that trades fixed income securities was left largely unscathed in July, though the bank flagged at the time that it still wanted to scale back the business of trading interest rate securities. Deutsche Bank is currently putting the finishing touches on a review of the unit, Bloomberg reported this month, and considers cuts of at least 10% of staff in the business.\n\nIn rates trading, investors buy and sell products such as government bonds and derivatives to profit or protect themselves from macroeconomic developments that affect interest rates. It\u2019s distinct from credit trading, where participants buy and sell debts and derivatives to wager on a company\u2019s ability to repay loans.\n\nAs part of the exit from equities trading, Sewing moved assets from that business to a separate unit where they\u2019re being sold or wound-down. He has sold the bank\u2019s hedge fund assets to BNP Paribas during the third quarter in a deal that will unfold over several years, and he\u2019s auctioned off various portfolios of equity derivatives.\n\n(Updates with share reaction in fifth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Donal Griffin.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Steven Arons in Frankfurt at sarons@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net, Christian Baumgaertel\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing\u2019s sweeping revamp of Deutsche Bank AG failed to arrest a slump in revenue, including in one of its areas of traditional strength: fixed income trading.Germany\u2019s largest lender, reporting its first results after deciding to exit equities trading", "authors": ["Steven Arons"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q4iE3yKK33vtkdPi6WAPSg--~B/aD0yNjY2O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/ea3cda023889894babbd5af34670d617", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
